2/24/2022,"Prince Harry has launched a libel action three days after the Mail on Sunday published claims about problems with his security arrangements. Court filings show Harry made a claim against Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) on Wednesday afternoon. The claims are reportedly related to an article published this week by the Mail on Sunday under the headline “Revealed: How Harry tried to keep his legal fight over bodyguards secret”.  The Duke of Sussex is also bringing privacy claims against News Group Newspapers, which publishes the Sun, and Mirror Group Newspapers, now Reach, which publishes the Mirror, over alleged phone hacking and unlawful information gathering. Prince Harry, 37, is also involved in litigation against the Home Office over his security arrangements when he is in the UK. The prince lost his taxpayer-funded police protection when he and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, stepped back from royal duties in 2020. The couple privately fund their security in the US, where they now live. The prince is challenging the Home Office decision not to allow him to personally pay for police protection for himself and his family while in the UK. Harry wants to bring his son, Archie, and daughter, Lilibet, to visit from the US, but his lawyers say he and his family are “unable to return to his home” because it is too dangerous. This follows an incident in London in the summer of 2021 when his security was compromised after his car was chased by paparazzi photographers as the prince left a charity event. Meghan previously brought a successful privacy claim against ANL over articles which reproduced parts of a “personal and private” handwritten letter to her estranged father, Thomas Markle. She was awarded £1 nominal damages for the privacy claim, along with an undisclosed sum in damages for copyright infringement, which she donated to charity, after winning her case. ANL was also ordered to issue a front-page apology and pay the duchess’s legal costs. An appeal by ANL was dismissed by senior judges in December last year. A spokesperson for the duke said: “I can confirm the duke has filed a complaint against Associated Newspapers Limited.” Associated Newspapers Limited have been approached for comment.",News/UK news,Prince Harry launches libel action against Mail on Sunday,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/24/prince-harry-launches-libel-action-against-mail-on-sunday

2/24/2022,"All Europe must have awoken this morning and heard the news with horror. Sometimes history refuses to die. The fate of 44 million Ukrainians at the mercy of Russia and its vast army is appalling to contemplate. Indeed so wild and mendacious are the utterances of Vladimir Putin in the past 24 hours as to suggest a dictator deranged and out of control. It is precisely the danger that was forecast by strategic theorists at the dawn of the nuclear age. As of this morning, Putin’s declared intention is to “demilitarise” Ukraine and assert Russia’s de facto sovereignty over the Donbas east of the country. The latter is chiefly an exaggeration of what Russia has done covertly since 2014. The former is hard to see other than as formal conquest. This is no longer some border dispute or separatist uprising, but the concerted assault of a great power on a substantial neighbour.  Ukraine’s friends and sympathisers have been fulsome in offering comfort and “support”. Ever since 1989, western Europe has been eager, perhaps over-eager, to welcome former Soviet bloc countries into its embrace. Many thought this a mistake. Offering Nato and EU membership up to Russia’s border was certain to inflame that country’s well-known sense of insecurity, but the risk was taken. At the same time any idea of including Ukraine and Georgia in that embrace was rightly thought a risk too far. Putin has now grotesquely proved that risk. Russia’s attack on Ukraine might be thought an aggression so outrageous as to outrank any consideration of treaties and alliances. But though the west has offered Kyiv ferocious moral support and will of course respond with humanitarian aid, it has been adamant that it is not obliged by Nato to fight in its cause. That must be sensible. But at such times words must be used with care. Belligerent support can look uncomfortably close to hypocrisy – as some Ukrainians are pleading. The west must distinguish outright condemnation of Russia from crowd-pleasing verbal aggression. Reality is sober. For Nato’s armies to go to war with Russia in Ukraine would for sure escalate to an atrocious cost in lives and destruction. We should also remember that the west and Nato have a dreadful recent record of such interventions, of an inability to judge their worth and when and how to end them. No war is like any other. Ukraine is not Cuba or Afghanistan or Syria – any more than Putin is a Hitler or Kyiv’s inhabitants Nazis. I heard not one speaker in Britain’s parliament this week counselling sobriety or peace. Belligerence – even from Keir Starmer – had not just the best tunes but the only ones. Inflicting that pathetic and ineffective weapon of modern interventionism, sanctions, is not toughness but the opposite. It is pretend toughness – short of actually getting tough. That is the danger. The shriller the threats, the more cowardly seems the refusal to fight. This is not yet a critical moment in relations between Russia – or at least its leader – and the west. It is critical in relations between Russia and a Ukraine with which it has had a long and historically turbulent relationship. There is, or was, a way out: the Minsk agreement of 2015 between Kyiv and Moscow, recognising Donbas autonomy. The failure of both sides to implement Minsk is the cause of the present collapse, but it cannot become the cause of some wider European conflagration. Serious talk is now known to be taking place on how to reach Putin, thrashing demented in his isolated citadel. He apparently listens to almost no one, but he does listen to China’s Xi Jinping and a tiny circle of rich cronies. It is obscene that peace in eastern Europe should depend on such people. But they must be reached. That is the true failure of European diplomacy over the past 30 years.

2/24/2022,"Joe Biden’s faltering effort to tackle the climate crisis faces a further, potentially devastating, blow on Monday in a supreme court case that experts warn could severely restrict any future US government attempt to limit planet-heating emissions. The court has agreed to hear a case brought by West Virginia, supported by 18 other Republican-led states, that takes aim at the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) ability to issue strict regulations to curb pollution from fossil fuel-fired power stations.  The decision by the conservative-leaning court to even consider an argument about a hypothetical regulation that hasn’t been proposed by the EPA has surprised onlookers. It is also an ominous sign for the authority of a Biden administration already frustrated over major clean energy legislation that has stalled in Congress due to opposition from Republicans and centrist Democrats such as West Virginia senator Joe Manchin. “This is a vitally important case that will define future federal action on climate change issues,” said Judith Enck, former EPA regional administrator and president of Beyond Plastics. “Congress seems unwilling or unable to address the climate crisis. Federal agencies need to be able to take action.” Even if Biden and his allies in Congress are able to pass the climate elements of the Build Back Better Act, which includes hundreds of billions of dollars in support for wind and solar energy and electric cars, most analysts say executive action to slash pollution from power plants, cars and trucks will still be needed if the US is to meet its emissions reduction goals and avert disastrous climate change. West Virginia’a lawsuit, filed last year and supported by various fossil fuel firms and rightwing groups, argues that the EPA shouldn’t be able to issue rules that “are capable of reshaping the nation’s electricity grids and unilaterally decarbonizing virtually any sector of the economy” and claims that Congress alone should decide on regulation of this scope. “This case is much more than about climate change, it gets down to who makes the decisions, should it be an unelected body of bureaucrats or should Congress provide the clear signal,” said Patrick Morrissey, attorney general of West Virginia, a state that’s a traditional epicenter of the now ailing coal industry. The Biden administration has pointed out there is no current EPA climate regulation on coal plants, meaning that there is no case to argue at all. “Petitioners lack standing to invoke this court’s jurisdiction because they are not injured,” the administration has argued in its brief. It’s unusual for the supreme court to hear a case where there is no active rule to challenge, according to Richard Revesz, a leading expert in environmental law at the New York University School of Law. “It surprised me they took this case, this would be an excellent candidate for dismissal,” he said. “In normal times, when the court wasn’t so skeptical of regulation, this case would’ve been dismissed. It would have a pernicious consequences if it were allowed because it could severely restrict agencies’ ability to regulate and these power stations are such big emitters.” The case has a tangled history that highlights America’s jarring absence of any climate regulations on the US electricity sector, which is responsible for a quarter of the country’s emissions, even as it has set emissions standards for the pollution spewed out by cars and trucks. In 2015, Barack Obama’s administration sought to remedy this via the Clean Power Plan, which aimed to restrict emissions from coal-fired power plants, only to be immediately challenged by Republican-led states and, in a highly unusual move, blocked by the supreme court before it took effect. Donald Trump’s administration then crafted a far weaker replacement for this rule that was itself struck down by the courts, with Biden so far declining to resurrect the original Clean Power Plan, or any more stringent alternative, in its place. West Virginia and its allies hope to curtail any future attempt by the EPA to become far more assertive in its interpretation of the landmark Clean Air Act, which requires power plants to use the “best system of emission reduction.” Environmental groups, which have lined up to oppose West Virginia’s claims, worry that the case is a further example of a rightwing judicial system intervening to toss out rules it does not like with the justification that they are too large, with damaging consequences for the climate crisis. Earlier this month, a Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana blocked the Biden administration from accounting for the real-world costs of climate change. “Even though there is no rule in place, the case is important because coal companies and their allies are attempting to get the supreme court to establish a broad precedent that meaningful protections for public health and the environment should be scrutinized and discredited on judicial review,” said Sean Donahue, counsel for Environmental Defense Fund. “Petitioners’ damaging legal theory would threaten our nation’s ability to protect clean air, clean water, and safe food for all people.” To some onlookers, the case is an unwanted further complication to a challenge that already has little time to waste. “There is no more time to delay curbing greenhouse gas emissions and finding solutions for a more equitable and just clean energy future,” said Carol Browner, former administrator of the EPA and now chair of the League of Conservation Voters.",News/Environment,Supreme court case could restrict Biden’s effort to tackle climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/24/supreme-court-case-biden-climate-crisis
2/24/2022,"Apleasant North Carolina day in December 2019 began with Commissioner Don Garber appearing in Charlotte to officially award the city an MLS franchise. Also at the event was David Tepper, the billionaire owner of the newly minted Charlotte FC and the NFL’s Carolina Panthers. The day ended with Tepper surrounded by crazed Charlotte FC fans – literally day one fans – at a brewery where it wasn’t easy to identify who among the crowd was the man cutting the $325m expansion fee check. Charlotte FC were little more than a theoretical concept on that day. Eight months ago, the team had no coach. Three months ago, they had only a handful of players. Five weeks ago, the coaching staff and players met together for the first time.  Pandemic be damned, Charlotte FC are here. And if they don’t yet have your attention, they soon will as they aim to set a new MLS single-game record for attendance with just under 75,000 at Bank of America Stadium on 5 March for their home opener. It didn’t happen by accident, nor did it come with a little frustration along the way. “I feel good, I feel positive,” Charlotte FC’s sporting director Zoran Krneta says. “I mean, this is a group of players that saw each other for the first time three weeks ago. No one knew each other, more or less.” Charlotte certainly haven’t been boring during their time in the limelight this offseason. They have acquired a number of intriguing players, such as Spanish central midfielder Sergio Ruiz; Christian Fuchs, who won a Premier League title with Leicester City; and rising talents from South America including Ecuadorians Jordy Alcivar and Alan Franco, plus Brazilian teenage forward Vinicius Mello. A few weeks after preseason opened, though, Charlotte had filled just one of their three Designated Player spots, places reserved for stars exempt from the league’s salary cap rules. With Tepper’s billions and grand ambitions, fans had expected a little more than their one designated player so far, Poland striker Karol Swiderski. Charlotte’s head coach, Miguel Angel Ramirez, seemed to expect more too. Ramirez was blunt in a video that went viral, choosing the phrase “estamos jodidos”, which can be politely translated from the Spanish as “we’re screwed.” Ramirez’s comments came in the same week that Charlotte’s $6m deal to acquire Venezuela international Darwin Machis fell through at the last minute when the player was reportedly in Charlotte ready to be unveiled. The club is understood to have pulled out as Machis has a court case active in Spain that centers around a bar fight. Another deal, for Poland international Kamil Jozwiak, collapsed around the same time, after the winger was injured playing for Derby County. That disappointment came a couple of weeks after a potential league-record bid to acquire USA winger Paul Arriola fell short. “I know that the fans might be a little bit less patient, and we’re frustrated too,” Krneta says. “I think that’s part of the game. This is a game full of emotions, full of passion. When the things are not going the way you want them to go, you express frustration and passion. We have everything under control, everything is positive.” Those fans are going to show up in force. Charlotte are aiming to set a new MLS record for single-game attendance. That record is particularly sought after because the current top 10 list for MLS attendance is dominated by their southeast rivals Atlanta United. At time of writing, the club are on track to accomplish their goal, looking at a likely sellout of just under 75,000 fans. “Honestly, I had some sleepless nights,” admits Nick Kelly, who was recently promoted to CEO of Tepper Sports & Entertainment after serving as Charlotte FC president. “Look, to be perfectly honest, it was extremely challenging [aiming to set the attendance record]. To create a game in which you’re going to want to be there and be part of history – yeah, it’s old school marketing – but we really wanted it too. And the building we’re in, we’re the only team that can do it.” Charlotte have already sold more than 20,000 season tickets, a figure comparable to the entire capacity of some other MLS stadiums. The club will share Bank of America Stadium with the Carolina Panthers, and the venue has undergone a $50m upgrade to accommodate Charlotte FC, including locker rooms specifically built for the soccer team. Capacity will be reduced to 38,000 for most of the team’s home games, with fans restricted to the lower bowl and club sections. Despite a passionate fanbase and the club’s sky-high ambitions, Ramirez’s “estamos jodidos” quote has raised fears that Charlotte may struggle to match Atlanta United, who won MLS Cup in just their second season. “We just want to be competitive and build, that would be a successful season for us,” Krneta says. “We cannot predict how much we will win, lose or draw, this is a long season. For me, I want Charlotte to be a place that teams don’t want to play because they know they will get a tough game. The rest? We’ll have to see what happens.” It all starts on Saturday when they travel to DC United, before their home opener a week later, followed by a trip to Atlanta United. “This is a part of history, it won’t happen again,” Kelly says. “We did it in the middle of a pandemic, we did it in one year. We should be proud of it.” He pauses briefly. “But, man, we can’t fall off a cliff from the highest high to the lowest low. We can’t roll out to Atlanta the next week and get smoked.”",Sport/Football,"Charlotte FC: the new MLS team hoping for 75,000 fans at their home opener",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/24/charlotte-fc-the-new-mls-team-hoping-for-75000-fans-at-their-home-opener
2/24/2022,"You could be forgiven for turning up your nose at tinned fish in the UK. Until recently, it has been more reminiscent of school lunches than restaurant menus: cheap, dry and mushy. But that is changing fast, thanks to retailers and chefs importing high-end, artisanal cans from the continent. The contents of these – think large, gleaming flakes of bonito tuna and silvery slippers of sardines bathing in olive oil – are about as far removed from sandwich fillers as a grass-fed steak is from Spam. At Spring-to-Go, the deli version of Skye Gyngell’s fine-dining restaurant, the chef offers small-batch, limited-edition seafood from the “tin-to-table” brand Pyscis. At Prawn on the Farm, a Cornish outpost of the London fish restaurant Prawn on the Lawn, Rick and Katie Toogood offer a separate menu of tinned fish, sourced from Rockfish, a British tinned seafood brand launched in November by the Devon-based chef Mitch Tonks. Tinned fish is so in that it has featured in Vogue, which called the Los Angeles-based tinned fish brand Fishwife “the stylish, sustainably sourced tinned fish you want in your kitchen”.  “Total [tinned] fish sales have nearly doubled over the past two years,” says James Robinson, a product training manager at Brindisa. “It has been remarkable growth.” For years, the Spanish restaurant and wholesaler was one of the only importers of premium tinned fish to the UK. “Premium tuna (rod- and line-caught bonito del norte and yellowfin) and anchovies have driven this increase, to retailers and direct-to-consumer sales.” All come from Ortiz, one of Spain’s oldest canning factories, notable for its jazzy blue, yellow and red packaging. Is the trend for fish from a tin a pandemic-fuelled flash in the pan – the result of regrettable stockpiling – or a nostalgic craving for retro foodstuffs? Patrick Martinez, who started his business Tinned Fish Market in Liverpool in 2018, doesn’t think so. He says there has been a palpable shift in the public’s appreciation of the European culture of conservas, the centuries-old craft of preservation through canning. “At the beginning, people asked: ‘How can you sell this at these prices?’ It took a lot of explaining,” he recalls, recounting how he would tell customers about the fishing villages where fish is landed, carefully selected by the canning factory, cooked and canned by hand, often all within 24 hours. “Now we have the opposite: we have people with a lot more knowledge coming to the stall, asking for very specific things, like tinned squid stuffed with rice.” Last year, Martinez opened stalls in the London foodie meccas of Borough and Broadway markets, which speaks volumes. “It’s sustainable, delicious, convenient and healthy,” says Martinez. These days, it can also be beautiful. Unlike the bland, monotonal supermarket standard, high-end tins tend to be adorned with either vintage illustrations of people or produce, or more modern, graphical designs. They could be given as gifts or used as decorative embellishments. “An interior designer told me she’d recommend people store their tins on open shelves, so people can see them,” says Lucas Gracias, the founder of Sardina, an online deli that sells tinned seafood from across the Iberian peninsula. As with natural wine, the popularity of which has also risen in recent years, the classy, vivid labels are perfect for an age in which the aesthetics of what we eat appears to matter more than ever. In short, canned seafood is social media catnip – but that doesn’t explain the interest from chefs, nor the repeat custom reported by retailers. “The artwork does grab the attention of people, but then hopefully they eat it,” says Gracias. If the contents didn’t live up to the cover, he argues, they wouldn’t come back. Perhaps our previous reluctance to embrace tinned fish can be explained by the almost uniquely British misconception that tinned food is worse than its fresh equivalent. “What we lack is the Spanish and Portuguese understanding that ‘fresh’ and ‘preserved’ foods are not intended to be mirrors of each other,” says Robinson. “Instinctively, people in the UK think fresh mussels or mackerel are better than tinned, whereas in Spain they understand that they are not equivalents.” Indeed, tins are often – because of the time and trouble involved in canning quality fish – more highly prized by other Europeans. In Britons’ defence, this is unsurprising. The UK does not have a long history of canned food, unlike Portugal, France or Spain, where the warmer climate necessitated preservation. It was only when rationing was introduced during the second world war that canned food began to dominate Britain’s supermarkets. “It fitted well with a system of stockpiling and central planning, so rations of tinned products were generally more liberal than those of fresh meat and fish,” says Mark Riddaway, the author of Borough Market: Edible Histories. Even after the war, fresh food remained scarce, resulting in “an entire generation being raised on Spam and tinned pilchards. These were not premium products,” he says. “Volume and cheapness mattered much more than the quality of the products and the food-safety standards at the canning factories. Some of the canned foods inflicted upon the nation were virtually inedible.” When Tonks wanted to launch a British brand of canned fish, he couldn’t find people with the requisite skills. “Our fish is caught and landed in Britain, in Brixham market, but then we have to ship it to Spain,” he says. This is done in small quantities alongside commonly exported products, to reduce the carbon footprint. In Spain, skilled artisans, many of whom are the third or fourth generation in their family to practise this craft, gut, fillet and cook the fish, “then lay it in the tin by hand, too, so it doesn’t all break apart”. This manual attention to detail is one of many reasons quality tins of fish are more expensive. “It is a much cheaper process to fillet the fish by machine, but it will break up into smaller pieces,” says Gracias. “It is also cheaper to just cook the fish in the tin, but the tin will [negatively] affect the flavour. Our producers steam, bake or cook the fish over charcoal first, to enhance the taste, before placing it in the can and heating it gently to seal it.” While industrial-scale factories – largely in Asia – use brine or sunflower oil for preservation, small, traditional canneries use organic or extra-virgin olive oil. “With time, the fish absorbs more and more of the oil,” says Tonks, who, like Martinez, is introducing the concept of vintages to Rockfish customers. “The two-year-old tins are fantastic,” observes the Quo Vadis chef Jeremy Lee of the sardines he buys from Brindisa. He would happily eat them “by the fistful, just as they are”. The merits of good olive oil (or tomato sauce) are myriad. As well as improving the quality of the fish over time, they mean you can benefit from the nutrients in the oil or sauce, as well as from the fish. The sustainability of canned fish is compelling, too. It reduces waste, while the strong, umami flavour of anchovies and sardines means a little goes a long way. “You get a lot of umami from less animal protein by using this tiny amount of fish,” says Jack Clarke, a sustainable seafood advocate at the Marine Conservation Society. “In the US, 31% of fresh fish bought by consumers is thrown away,” he adds. “Tinned fish lasts [almost] for ever, at ambient temperatures.” It is also, Tonks points out, a good way of preserving during times when there is a seasonal glut – in summer, for example, when sardines overeat because there is more plankton around. Of course, canned fish is not carte blanche from a sustainability perspective. “Just because a tin has charming ‘olde worlde’ artwork and costs £14 doesn’t translate into being sustainable,” says Clarke. On the contrary, “some of these fancy ranges have cuttlefish and octopus, which are rated red [“fish to avoid”] in our Good Fish Guide.” That said, plenty of premium brands offer sustainable options – and, in terms of contents, coolness and cultural value, they are certainly a different kettle of fish to the pilchards that might have once been served up by your nan.

Rub this over the pork loin, then place in a baking dish (fat side down) and cook for 45 minutes, turning over after 20 minutes. Leave to cool completely. Make the sauce by putting a tin of tuna, an egg yolk and the juice of ½ lemon in a food processor. Season, then blend to a puree. With the motor still running, drizzle in 250ml olive oil until the thickness of yoghurt. To serve, thinly slice the pork, slather over the sauce and scatter with capers and whole tinned anchovies.

Toast 1 tsp fennel seeds in a dry pan over a medium heat. Arrange 12 tinned sardine fillets on top of the tomatoes.

2/24/2022,"Indigenous leaders who mobilized Arizona voters to help elect Senator Kyrsten Sinema say the centrist Democratic lawmaker can no longer count on their support, as communities feel betrayed. Sinema was elected in 2018, halfway through Trump’s term, amid growing alarm at the rollback of voting rights and environmental protectionsthat disproportionately impact tribal communities. She entered the senate after six years in congress, having beaten her Republican opponent with 50% of the vote, thanks in part to the large turnout among Indigenous Americans in Arizona.  Two years later, another record turnout among the state’s 22 tribes was crucial in flipping Arizona from red to blue and securing Biden’s path to the White House. Now, Sinema’s record as a senator is under mounting scrutiny after she and West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin sided with Republicans to keep the filibuster in place, effectively killing legislation designed to counter an onslaught of voting rights restrictions in states across the country. The sweeping voting rights reforms include the Native American voting rights act (Navra) , which would allow tribes to determine the number and location of voter registration sites, polling places and ballot drop boxes on their reservations. Navra is widely supported by tribal nations but Democrats need 10 Republicans to vote for the legislation if the filibuster remains intact. Sinema supports the voting rights legislation, but it has no chance of passing unless the filibuster – the senate tradition designed to allow the minority party to prolong debate and delay or prevent a vote - is removed. Jonathan Nez, president of the Navajo Nation, the largest tribe in the US, told the Guardian: “We’re disappointed in the senator. She’s on the national stage due to the Native American vote and large turnout among Navajo people. If she doesn’t deliver on what’s important to us, I’m sure there’s another candidate who will.” “There is much frustration among voters, the Native American voting rights act is very important to us given the way the state of Arizona has been chipping away at our voting rights,” added Nez. Nationally, there are 574 federally recognized American Indian tribes and Alaska Native Villages, accounting for about 1.5% (4.5m) of the total population. This includes 22 tribes in Arizona including the Tohono O’odham Nation, the Hopi tribe, three Apache tribes and the Navajo Nation, whose territory extends into Utah and New Mexico. Just over 27% of Arizona is governed by tribal sovereignty. The political culture varies from tribe to tribe – and some in Arizona have publicly voiced support for Sinema – but those in Indigenous communities are less likely to be registered to vote than other groups due to a number of historical barriers. Indigenous Americans didn’t have the right to vote until 1948. Longstanding structural obstacles including poor roads, scarce public transit options, and limited postal and translation services have restricted their participation in elections. In recent years, Arizona and several other states have passed laws and regulations that make voting even harder for Indigenous Americans – and other underserved communities who tend to vote Democrat. This includes restrictions on early voter locations, mail-in ballots and ballot collection drives, which legal experts say disproportionately impact ruralIndigenous voters. The senate has also thwarted two bills Republicans had previously blocked four times with a filibuster – the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Navra, which does have some bipartisan support, would ban states from closing or merging polling sites on reservations without tribal consent, and would require states with voter identification laws to accept tribal ID. Sinema’s support of the filibuster has undermined a mammoth effort by grassroots activists to mobilize Indigenous voters, according to Tara Benally, field director of the Utah Rural Project, a nonprofit that mobilizes underrepresented voters in rural Arizona and Utah. “Our community outreach workers spent hours upon hours registering and gaining the trust of voters in the run up to the 2018 and 2020 elections after decades of being pushed aside at the local, state and federal level. Senator Sinema has completely undermined what we did and betrayed her voters. I highly doubt people will vote for her again unless by some miracle she changes her values and stops working against those who elected her,” Benally said. About 10,000 new Indigenous voters were registeredin Arizona ahead of the last presidential election – which Biden won by just over 10,000 votes. In 2020, voter turnout on the reservations ranged from 41 to 71% compared to 29 to 57% in 2016. Torey Dolan, an Indigenous fellow at the Indian Law Clinic at Arizona State University, said: “Sinema got the lion’s share of the votes on the reservations; they played a significant role in getting her and Biden elected. Her opposition to removing the filibuster means a death nail for Navra, and that has left a sour taste in a lot of people’s mouths here.” “[Going forward] it will be hard to encourage people to register when they don’t see their votes fulfilling the hopes and promises placed on them,” Dolan said. Sinema voted with Donald Trump 63% of the time as a member of the House (2016 to 2018) and 26% of the time as a senator (2019 to 2021), according to FiveThirtyEight. Voting for the filibuster was the first time she voted against her party since Biden took office. In addition to voting rights, Biden’s $1.75tn sweeping economic recovery and social welfare spending initiative is also in serious trouble. The Build Back Better (BBB) bill includes funding for affordable housing, healthcare, nutrition, education grants and child support – basic services which are disproportionately lacking in tribal communities due to the US government’s failure to comply with treaty obligations. Unlike towns and cities, tribes cannot raise money through property taxes as reservation lands are held in trust by the federal government. The BBB also includes $550bn to tackle greenhouse emissions, the country’s largest ever climate crisis investment. It builds on other major infrastructure investments, such as the American Rescue Plan, that have benefited tribal communities. Unlike Manchin, who outright opposes the bill, Sinema has signaled support for the White House’s BBB framework but has not committed to voting for it in its current form. Hannah Hurley, Sinema’s spokesperson, said: “Kyrsten remains laser-focused on delivering lasting solutions for tribal communities across Arizona, and thanks to strong partnerships with tribal leaders she’s delivered historic investments improving tribal roads and bridges, ensuring cleaner water, deploying broadband, helping tribes tackle climate change challenges, and strengthening health care resources. She will continue to work with tribal communities in Arizona expanding economic opportunities and ensuring the federal government honors its obligations.” But Eric Descheenie, former Arizona state house representative for the district which includes the Navajo Nation, said Sinema faces a major trust issue. “The climate change agenda needs help from senators like Kyrsten Sinema, who represents some of the most influential tribes in the land, and needs to do a better job heeding the wisdom of our people…. The problem is, no progressive can trust her,” Descheenie said.",News/US news,Why Indigenous voters who helped elect Kyrsten Sinema now feel betrayed,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/24/kyrsten-sinema-native-american-indigenous-voters-filibuster-arizona
2/24/2022,"Becca Losch wore goggles and a mouthguard. She did exercises to strengthen her knee ligaments. Yet the prospect of a head injury barely crossed her mind. In 2012, while a student at a New Jersey high school, she was hit in the back of the head by a lacrosse ball during a warm-up drill before a game. She does not remember falling to the ground, being helped up by teammates and carrying on.  The next six months were a blur of pain, confusion and frustration. Before her concussion, Losch was an energetic honour student who played lacrosse, basketball and soccer. Her health deteriorated so gravely that she struggled to read, write, walk up stairs and brush her teeth. She became too unwell to attend school, enduring migraines, eye pain, photosensitivity, insomnia, nausea, exhaustion, dizziness, tinnitus and an inability to focus. That autumn she was referred to the concussion programme at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and slowly improved under treatment plans which included retraining her brain to improve her balance and vision problems. After a year of homeschooling – cycles of 10 minutes of verbal tuition, then five minutes’ rest – Losch was able to return for her senior year, dictating essays into an app, graduating on time with honours and going on to attend college. Now she wears headgear every day: a $30 ice pack bought from Amazon that she wraps around her head to soothe her migraines. Losch is convinced that her devastating injury would have been far less serious if she had worn a hard helmet, which was forbidden by the rules. “My doctors are pretty confident, especially where I was hit, on the back of my head, that it would have significantly decreased or I wouldn’t have had the injury at all,” she says. The firm, dense rubber ball can travel at speeds far greater than 60mph but hard-shell helmets and face masks are obligatory in US boys’ lacrosse while flexible headgear is optional for girls (goalies aside). Among other important differences, some forms of body checking are allowed for boys over 12. The rules divergence can be traced to sexism as the sport grew in the 1930s, when contact sports were viewed as inappropriate for women. Yet a 2015 study of concussions in college and high school football, soccer, lacrosse and ice hockey found that women’s lacrosse had the second-highest incidence rate after football. That year, Florida became the first state to mandate headgear in girls’ high school lacrosse, a decision that met with widespread resistance within the sport. No other states have followed so far, even as evidence mounts of the potential value of headgear. A 2020 study led by Dawn Comstock of the Colorado School of Public Health examined high school lacrosse head injuries from 2008-09 to 2018-19 and estimated that 44.7% of girls’ concussions could have been prevented had they worn the same helmet as the boys. “For boys, athlete-athlete contact was the most common mechanism of concussion accounting for 66.4% of all concussions, while stick or ball contact accounted for 23.5%,” the authors wrote. “For girls, stick or ball contact accounted for 72.7% of all concussions, while athlete-athlete contact accounted for 19.8%.” A major study of 357,225 games and practices published in 2021 by University of Florida Health also indicates that headgear can have a significant protective effect in female high school lacrosse. Researchers found that states without headgear mandates had a 59% higher concussion rate compared to Florida. The disparity rose to 74% during competitions, since games are more dangerous than training sessions. Knowing little about the sport, Rob Stolker had no initial objection when his two youngest daughters asked him in 2014 if they could play lacrosse. He asked the coaches why the girls did not have helmets and shoulder pads like the boys on the adjacent field. “They said, ‘girls don’t wear helmets’, just matter-of-factly. I didn’t understand it then, I still don’t understand it now.” He researched the issue and decided not to let his daughters play. After discovering there were no approved headgear options he founded Hummingbird Sports, one of only two women’s lacrosse headgear manufacturers whose equipment meets certification requirements implemented in 2017 by the governing body, USA Lacrosse, after years of research and development. Stolker is a member of the Brain Safety Alliance, a headgear advocacy group. Defenders of the status quo often question the effectiveness of headgear in preventing body-to-body concussions and cite dubious fears that improved protective equipment will inspire a “gladiator effect”, an attitude shift that induces the kind of rough contact more often seen in the male game. “It is complete bunk. To people outside it doesn’t make any sense,” Stolker says. Losch’s injury resulted from an accident, not deliberate aggression. Strict enforcement of the rules by officials and coaches ought to discourage recklessness, and helmets are likely to be most effective against the stick and ball injuries that the 2020 analysis suggests are most common in the female game. The Florida study findings cast doubt on the “gladiator effect” theory. Stolker believes that by continuing to treat male and female players differently the sport is placing tradition over safety: “That is the way it is, 100% that’s the issue here,” he said. “There’s a feeling [among parents] that organisational leaders are looking out for the safety of their girls and that’s what clearly doesn’t happen.” Ann Kitt Carpenetti, vice-president of lacrosse operations at USA Lacrosse, disagrees. “If we had just done nothing that would be fair,” she says. “We have invested dollars and been thoughtful about our approach. We haven’t ever said that we are closed off to policy change.” She points out that USA Lacrosse mandated eyewear in the female game in 2004-05 and contributed funding for the Florida analysis. “It’s the first study of its kind on a novel piece of headgear. It has had some benefit,” Carpenetti says, but “is it conclusive enough to make everybody have to wear it? I think there is a lot of support within the research community as well as in the game community to continue to ask questions… We’re proponents of making evidence-based decisions and that’s what we’re going to continue to do.” As coaches, officials and local and state associations digest the Florida report, the topic is likely to spark debate in the summer, the time of year when rule changes are proposed and agreed ahead of the next season. Losch now lives in New York and works in pharmaceutical advertising. She takes Botox injections every three months to help with her daily migraines. “That has significantly improved my quality of life. Prior to that, every time the weather changed or if I had to be on the computer for an hour I would get a migraine to the point where I was vomiting,” she says. “I try not to let it hold me back, still kind of have a life. I’ll be in pain whether I’m home or if I’m out, so I just kind of keep going.” She is optimistic that headgear will eventually be mandated in girls’ lacrosse. “That would be lovely,” she says. “I don’t want anyone else to have to go through this.”",Sport/Sport,‘I’m in pain wherever I am’: the troubling rise of concussion in girls’ lacrosse,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/24/im-in-pain-wherever-i-am-the-troubling-rise-of-concussion-in-girls-lacrosse
2/24/2022,"The pandemic changed everything about our lives: how we worked, socialised, travelled. Dealing with so many changes at once was a mental challenge for us all. As Covid-19 fizzles out, and things go back to “normal”, some of these pressures will ease as life becomes more recognisable. But the end of a pandemic will require an adjustment, just as the beginning did. For a start, we are not entering the same “normal” that we left – and we are not the same people we were then. Some of us will face lingering mental health problems, including those who have developed severe, chronic grief over the loss of loved ones, or people who have developed post-traumatic stress disorder because of experiences with the disease.  A new vocabulary of psychological terms has blossomed during the pandemic. “Cave syndrome”, a fear of going out among the vaccinated; “coronaphobia”, an intense fear of catching the virus; and “Covid stress syndrome”. These neologisms provided labels that helped people to better understand their experiences and the experiences of those around them. But the terms, having served their purpose, will probably fall by the wayside once the pandemic is over, to be replaced with more conventional psychiatric labels – “agoraphobia’”, “adjustment disorder” – as described in the latest edition of the psychiatric bible, DSM-5-TR, due to be released next month. Meanwhile, pandemics typically do not have clean, neat endings. Restrictions in England might be ending on Thursday, but it is unlikely that you’ll wake up one morning to news reports declaring that Covid has gone. It may take months or longer for some people to reassure themselves that the pandemic is truly over, and even longer for some to relax into activities that were fraught with risk for two years. Many may suspect that the “end” of the pandemic is more a political construct than anything else. As pandemic fatigue set in, people became increasingly tired and frustrated with government restrictions on travel and socialisation. The growing weariness with Covid motivates some people, especially those who see the threat as overblown, to protest against remaining restrictions. Governments initially clamped down on people flouting the rules, but it gets hard to enforce these rules with good conscience when it turns out so many politicians are openly ignoring them, such as by holding illicit garden parties. Community-wide fatigue with Covid and rising protests are likely to be factors fuelling government decisions to lift restrictions and allow people to live their lives as before. As a result of all this, the “roaring 20s” scenario – a promised post-pandemic party time – seems increasingly unlikely. As the current pandemic gradually fizzles out, people will resume their previous lives. There will, perhaps, be celebrations of some kind when the WHO declares that we have entered a vaguely defined “post-pandemic period”, which is how it described the end of the 2009 swine flu pandemic. However, the WHO has mistakenly declared outbreaks to be over in the past: for example, in 2015 and 2016 it wrongly declared that an Ebola outbreak was over, finally getting it right the third time. For Covid, we can look forward to entering a “post-pandemic period”, with all the uncertainty the term implies. Covid will still be circulating in communities and people will have to decide for themselves, based on their risk tolerance, whether they should wear masks, go to crowded social gatherings and so on. This uncertain status quo will take some adjustment, just as it did during the protracted end of past pandemics such as the 1889 Russian flu and 1918 Spanish flu. In the months and years ahead, the emotional legacy of Covid will become clearer. The mental health toll may not be apparent for some years. Nevertheless, the research strongly suggests that most people will bounce back, and some will grow as human beings – a phenomenon known as post-traumatic growth. This involves growing through adversity as people learn to become more resilient and develop a deeper appreciation for everyday things in life, such as our connections to friends and family. The pandemic has also taught us the importance of developing resilience – the ability to manage the stressors, large and small, in our lives. Resilience may be one positive legacy of a very tough couple of years.

2/24/2022,"The former Wales and Manchester City manager Mark Hughes has returned to football with Bradford City after being appointed as the League Two club’s manager on a deal until the summer of 2024. Hughes has never managed a club outside the Premier League but has returned to the game, with a side 15th in League Two, for the first time since leaving Southampton more than three years ago. Bradford sacked Derek Adams last week.  Bradford have had eight permanent managers in the past four years and have turned to Hughes to try to guide them out of League Two amid another disappointing season. “I am really pleased to be here and am looking forward to the role and the job in hand,” Hughes said. “It has been an exciting few days. “It is maybe a little bit of a surprise that I have come in, but do not be put off by that. I am here for a reason: to make Bradford City a team people want to come and watch – and are proud to watch. The supporters come in their numbers, and that is the thing I have missed since being out of management. “I am looking forward to the match day, getting that adrenaline flowing and interacting with the crowd. Certainly, from now until the end of the year, we just want to finish strongly and see where that takes us. We want to move the club and everybody with it forward, and hope we can have the success everyone wants.” Hughes was sacked by Southampton in December 2018, having taken the role the previous March and signed a long-term contract that summer. He was dismissed with the club 18th in the Premier League and was replaced by Ralph Hasenhüttl. “We are delighted to have secured Mark’s services and I am looking forward to working alongside him,” the Bradford chief executive, Ryan Sparks, said. “His record and stature in the game speaks for itself, and he has achieved a great deal. To have him in our dugout is representative of the club’s ambition and desire to be successful. “Mark expressed an interest in becoming our manager and, following talks between him, myself and [the chairman] Stefan Rupp, we are today thrilled to be in a position to unveil him. This is without doubt one of the most significant appointments in the history of our football club. Mark recognises our true potential – and has the desire to ensure we fulfil it.”",Sport/Football,Mark Hughes makes shock return to management at League Two Bradford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/24/mark-hughes-bradford-manager-shock-return

2/24/2022,"During a brief window between named storms this month, 30 or so people gather in a darkened car park on a hillside east of Snowdonia. Red lights are flashing hither and yon. “Has everyone got warm hats and decent shoes?” asks Dani Robertson, dark skies officer at the North Wales Dark Skies Partnership, with the tone of a concerned mum. “We’ve got some camping mats if you need them” The group mumbles in the affirmative, before setting off for a 15-minute walk up Moel Famau in the Clwydian Range Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. We’re here for an introductory astronomy session, one of a series of events organised for the first Welsh Dark Skies Week at several locations across the country – other options include a astro-archaeology lectures and astral photography courses. The red lights on torches and headlamps provided will allow night vision to develop – not just for the rocky path ahead, but hopefully for optimal stargazing, too.  The idea is to learn a little about the cosmos and the damage done by light pollution, and hopefully to encourage participants to contribute less unnecessary light in the evenings. The group pushes on into the chilly February night: heather fringes the footpath, and young ash trees are silhouetted ominously on the hillside to the left. Above, there is a more obvious problem: cloud cover. “If you want to guarantee clouds, all you have to do is arrange an astronomy event,” says astronomer and college lecturer Rob Jones. “But darkness is about more than just stars,” he adds quickly. Low clouds amplify the light pollution on the fringes of this deeply dark place. The small town of Ruthin appears as obnoxiously bright as Las Vegas Boulevard compared with the inky valleys around it. Chester lies over the horizon to the east, but glows as though aflame, its light bouncing off the clouds above. Robertson tells the group about the manifold problems of too much light – especially the ultra-bright LEDs that have become commonplace over the past decade. She begins to explain how this can affect the health of people and animals but doesn’t get too far before the clouds miraculously begin to melt, then part. With our eyes already helpfully dilated like Ibizan clubbers, the stars – little and otherwise – twinkle-twinkle above. Jones begins to talk us through individual stars, using a green laser pen that he appears to shoot across the galaxy. He introduces “Rigel the blue supergiant”, the brightest star in the constellation Orion. The green lance then moves north-west to point out Betelgeuse, an ancient star on its way to supernova and also part of Orion. Jones begins to stretch our level of comprehension by explaining that the star may already be dead – it’s so distant from Earth (642.5 light years) that it could have exploded before Columbus sailed to the New World in 1492, and the light from that violent event still wouldn’t have reached us yet. A six-year-old boy – who wisely asked his parents to bring a hot-water bottle up the hill with him – has his mind gently blown by this knowledge, information he seems to accept more readily than the news that, no, that flashing light crossing the sky is not a UFO but an aircraft. “I think it went well,” says Robertson when we meet the following afternoon, in blindingly bright weather. “Between the storms and the pandemic, I wasn’t sure how things were going to go, but the event last night was sold out and all across the country it has been really popular. It seems to have got people’s attention.” Creating stargazers – or astral photographers, or nocturnal animal spotters – is a happy byproduct of the week, but the main aim is to improve appreciation and desire for dark skies. In this, Wales is already blessed – with two official international dark dky reserves in the Brecon Beacons and Snowdonia. But Robertson and her team are in the process of applying to the International Dark Sky Association to have more regions similarly classified (including Clwydian Range and Dee Valley AONB). The Welsh Dark Skies Week is in part designed to raise awareness of this campaign, with events in national parks and AONBs all over the country. Outside the Dark Skies Week, Robertson and colleagues run events year round: in winter they focus on stargazing, walks, telescope and astrophotography workshops and talks using a pop-up planetarium. In summer the focus is more on wildlife and biodiversity, with owl walks, bat box making, night swimming, and glow worm and nightjar walks. Go Stargazing’s Dark Sky Sites is, she adds, a good guide to places that are accessible at night and safe for the public to stargaze without having to trek miles. But further designations and awareness will bring additional benefits – part of the process to become a Dark Sky Reserve or Park is having the local authority adopt planning rules that enforce a high standard of lighting to minimise light pollution. “We want those designations because they do bring benefits, including tourism, but for us it’s more about resident health, whether that’s people or animals,” says Robertson. “It’s about using it with consideration. We’re not trying to take people’s lights away – it’s more about getting them to use the right lights in the right places.” She is quick to acknowledge that the widespread shift to LED lighting massively reduced the carbon footprint of conventional bulbs, while simultaneously reducing the energy bills of both households and local authorities. “Unfortunately, they didn’t have the understanding of the colour temperatures at the time – they tried to replicate daylight, so a really harsh light. That’s detrimental to human and animal health. It’s like crossing the road from carbon emissions only to be hit by the bus of biodiversity collapse.” As human settlements have grown larger and brighter, so certain species have found it harder to orient themselves. This affectsmigratory birds and, more problematically, insects, vital pollinators and the basis of many food chains. Unlike other forms of pollution, which would take years to clean out of the environment, light is one of the easiest to fix. “You just have to switch off and that’s it,” she says. “All done.” Welsh Dark Skies Week runs until 27 February and will return next year.
