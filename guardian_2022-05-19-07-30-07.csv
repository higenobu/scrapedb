5/19/2022,"Injured women are experiencing sex discrimination in the administration of a life-saving drug that cuts the risk of bleeding to death by 30%, researchers have warned. They found that female trauma victims were half as likely to receive tranexamic acid (TXA) as injured men – even though the treatment is equally effective regardless of sex. “These results are very concerning. TXA is the only proven life-saving treatment for traumatic bleeding. Women were treated less frequently than men regardless of their risk of death from bleeding or the severity of their injuries,” said Prof Ian Roberts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), who was involved in the study. “This looks like sex discrimination, and there is an urgent need to reduce this disparity, so all patients who need the drug have the chance to receive it.” TXA helps blood to clot, and is used to prevent excessive bleeding in various situations, including where there is known or suspected severe bleeding after an injury. It is also given following certain types of head injury. To investigate whether the drug is equally effective in men and women, Tim Nutbeam at the University of Plymouth and colleagues reanalysed data from two large trials which showed that giving TXA within three hours of traumatic injury reduces the risk of death. They found that the drug reduces the risk of death by up to 30%, regardless of sex. Next, they examined data from 216,000 patients included on the Trauma Audit Research Network (Tarn) database, which collects information from major trauma units in England and Wales, to see if injured men and women were treated differently. “Whatever of the mechanism of injury, and whatever the bleeding risk we looked at, women were statistically less likely to receive tranexamic acid than men, apart from road traffic collisions with a very high risk of bleeding,” said Nutbeam, whose research was published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia. “However, when we looked at mechanisms of injury which we tend to associate less with major trauma, such as falls from standing, women and particularly older women were much less likely to receive it.” As striking as these results are, they are not necessarily surprising, he added: “It is already known that women with chest pain are less likely to receive aspirin, less likely to be resuscitated for out of hospital cardiac arrest, and less likely to be taken to hospital by an ambulance using lights and sirens.” Explaining why these differences in TXA administration exist requires further research. “We can only speculate,” Nutbeam said. “I think very little of it is doctors or paramedics saying: ‘I don’t like women, and therefore I’m not going to give them this drug.” One issue may be the training that doctors and paramedics have received. “Traditionally we are taught that trauma is about young men in car accidents, or doing something silly after consuming drugs or alcohol, but the reality is that it affects every spectrum of society, and it disproportionately affects older patients,” said Nutbeam. “Clinicians in the UK must be provided with clearer treatment guidance so that we can help reduce this bias.”",News/Society,"Injured women face discrimination over life-saving drugs, say researchers",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/18/injured-women-discrimination-life-saving-drugs-researchers
5/19/2022,"Elon Musk said on Twitter that he plans to “vote Republican” and warned of “political attacks” on him, the latest in a series of tweets from the billionaire expressing discontent with Democrats and progressives. Musk’s tweet comes as the Tesla CEO shocked markets this week by announcing his $44bn deal to purchase Twitter was on hold as he awaited further data on fake and spam accounts on the social media platform. Analysts have speculated the Tesla executive is seeking to back out of his Twitter takeover plans, or buy the company at a lower price. His tweets since – including that he was buying the platform to “own the libs” – have attracted further controversy. On Wednesday, Musk warned that political attacks against him would “escalate” in the coming months and said he will no longer support Democrats because they are the party of “division” and “hate”. Musk, who says he is politically “moderate”, made a similar claim earlier this week, stating that he had long backed Democrats, but would now vote for Republicans. In the past I voted Democrat, because they were (mostly) the kindness party.But they have become the party of division & hate, so I can no longer support them and will vote Republican.Now, watch their dirty tricks campaign against me unfold … 🍿 Political attacks on me will escalate dramatically in coming months Musk has become increasingly critical of Joe Biden, who he has accused of snubbing his electric car company Tesla. He’s also moved his home and company headquarters from California to Texas, where, unlike the Golden State, there is no state income tax. The Tesla CEO has also long faced scrutiny from federal regulators. Musk is reportedly being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for not reporting his 5% stake in Twitter soon enough, the Wall Street Journal reported. And he was previously penalized by the SEC over 2018 tweets in which he said he had “secured funding” to take Tesla private Musk has claimed that Twitter has a “very far-left” bias and that he plans to bring balance to the platform. He has also said he will reinstate Donald Trump, whom Twitter permanently banned after finding his tweets were “highly likely to encourage and inspire people to replicate the criminal acts” that took place in the January 6 Capitol attack. The billionaire’s tweets have rocked Twitter’s share price and fueled speculation about his motivations. This week he sent a poop emoji in response to Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal’s tweets about spam. Musk suggested earlier this week that he could see a lower price for the company because of the fake accounts. “It really depends on a lot of factors here,” he said. “I’m still waiting for some sort of logical explanation for the number of sort of fake or spam accounts on Twitter. And Twitter is refusing to tell us. This seems like a strange thing.” Musk’s agreement to buy Twitter is legally binding, and he could face a $1bn break fee for walking away. “Twitter is committed to completing the transaction on the agreed price and terms as promptly as practicable,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday.",News/Technology,Elon Musk plans to ‘vote Republican’ and warns of political attacks on him,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/18/elon-musk-republican-political-attacks
5/19/2022,"Whenever a comedy based around women’s sexual adventures and misadventures arrives, I always settle down before it with one question: will it pass the mons pubis test? That is: does it have a single scene, moment, plot point or anything else that approaches the story of my friend, who was in bed with a man who was proving lacklustre – but unexpectedly asked her if she’d like oral sex. Pleasantly surprised, she said yes. He promptly bent down, kissed her on the mp – “Like you would the cheek of an elderly relative” is a description that stays with me – patted her on the flank, rolled over and went to sleep. Except for Pulling and Fleabag, the answer is rarely yes. The latest addition to the genre, Spreadsheet, an Australian import on Channel 4, but starring England’s own Katherine Parkinson (The IT Crowd, Humans, Hang Ups), alas does nothing to redress the balance. Parkinson plays Lauren, a slightly chaotic divorced lawyer and mother of two trying to carve out some time between her domestic and professional commitments for as much no-commitment sex as she can find. To this end, she and her assistant Alex (Rowan Witt) have compiled the eponymous spreadsheet, replete with columns for potential peen, salient characteristics of the men attached to them, times and dates of – uh – dates, plus post-shag notes and scores. To anticipate the traditional objection: you’re right, it wouldn’t be acceptable if the sexes were reversed. Why? You know why. Stop being disingenuous and forcing us to have the conversation about context, history, structural sexism and oppression and all the well rehearsed rest of it. Just kick back and enjoy your general privilege, ’K? Thank you! Blessings upon you! So. It is the kind of comedy where (actual) oral sex in a car park is referred to as “dining alfresco”. It is the kind of comedy in which the lead is a tech moron so sexy messages and pictures are accidentally sent to friends and colleagues instead of hook-ups. It is the kind of comedy where some online inamoratos turn out to have been using extremely flattering profile pics. It is the kind of comedy in which all of her supposed one night stands are keen to meet up again, and one of them turns out to be the PE teacher at her children’s school. “We might need to be a little more specific in the workplace column,” she tells Alex. Parkinson is as good as ever, within the limits of the material. And there are occasional touches that rise above the basics. Although the presence of an obtuse secretary in these things is de rigueur, Katrina Milosevic is so good as Ange, ever-admiring of her boss’s bravery (“All those apps. Competing with girls half your age and they’ve all got … the face”) that she’s almost worth the price of admission alone. A date with a man with suspected hyperspermia (opinion is divided as to whether his dating profile photo – which showcases many centilitres of unspeakableness – is the product of one or many deposits) is a new one on me. And Lauren’s family relationships – with her children (exceptionally good and genuinely charming turns from youngsters Maila Latukefu and Harper Nichols, which give such a lift to the family scenes), her sister-in-law and her ex-husband – are rather sweetly and sensitively drawn. Despite a handful of good lines in each episode, most of the script is slightly laboured (“A black and white [profile] picture can make a loaf of gluten-free bread look mysterious,” says Alex). And, overall, the feeling you’re left with is one of faint boredom, edging into depression. Is this really the best we can do where women and sex are concerned in the year of our lord 2022? Is a mother/professional/slightly older woman hoping to get her end away without emotional investment still a valid enough premise to get behind? It feels at this point as if we’re all just still pretending that it is. Sex without commitment has been a real thing for long enough now that making it the complicating factor of a sitcom requires a collective act of disbelief before the action even begins. There’s nothing true about it, and any essentially naturalistic comedy needs to flow from some truth, somewhere.",Arts/Television & radio,Spreadsheet review – Katherine Parkinson’s sex sitcom does not belong in 2022,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/18/spreadsheet-review-katherine-parkinsons-sex-sitcom-does-not-belong-in-2022
5/19/2022,"This garlanded production of Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe’s musical, fresh from Broadway, is the definition of a comforting night out at the theatre. It glides from one well-loved song to the next on an elegantly twirling set designed by Michael Yeargan. Amara Okereke, as Eliza Doolittle, has a voice that fills the auditorium. It is a thrill to see Vanessa Redgrave as Henry Higgins’s mother – even if she is gone in the blink of an eye. Higgins (Harry Hadden-Paton) himself is a foppish mashup of several Very English Types, from Colin Firth to Doctor Who – slightly bumbling and not nearly as patrician or haughty as Rex Harrison in the 1964 film. But for those who have seen that screen classic, it is hard to list the reasons to come out for this faithful revival rather than stay at home with the movie. Under Bartlett Sher’s direction, the lack of invention feels like a missed opportunity. It is thoroughly preserved in aspic – a time capsule of reassuringly good music, nice dresses and lots of insults towards women of a low social order – Eliza is a “cabbage-leaf” and “baggage” to be walloped if she is naughty. There are no knowing winks, twists or clever allusions to the here and now, except for one weak joke about Englishness and a tweaked final scene that left me puzzled and unconvinced. Lerner and Loewe’s musical take on George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion looks and feels much like a comforting Christmas show. At times, it begins to resemble pantomime in its over-acting and most certainly in Redgrave’s immense Ascot hat in the race day scene. It is solidly performed all round but characterless and sedate. Funny moments – the turning point in Eliza’s elocution lessons and the disdain of her dustbin man father (Stephen K Amos) for his new middle-class life – never really catch fire. Okereke’s Eliza has an exaggerated comedy walk: elbows pushed out, shrugged shoulders, stomps and squeals. We never see the softer, more vulnerable side to her character. Hadden-Paton, who starred in the original 2018 show in New York, brings a boyish charm to his part as the arrogant linguistics expert who scrapes a flower-seller off the streets of London so that he can transform her into a duchess. His derisory comments on women and the working-classes sound desperately antiquated – what would he make of the Urban Dictionary? And would his committed bachelorhood in I’m An Ordinary Man render him an incel today? But his point on regional accents as a classifier of social standing in Britain remains depressingly relevant in the assumptions we still make. The chemistry between Higgins and Eliza never kicks in and there is no real hint of an awkward romance between them, even after Eliza has sung I Could Have Danced All Night. They are better at playing mutual animosity, although there is growly shouting rather than anything more subtle. It is easy to see why this show was such a hit on Broadway, with its exportable vision of a bygone Britain filled with top hats, period lamp-posts and oak-panelled rooms. Could it be that this Disneyfied Englishness is simply built to win the hearts, and wallets, of West End tourists or is that too cynical?

5/19/2022,"The City watchdog will be handed powers to ensure local communities across the UK have access to cash and could ultimately fine banks that fail to comply. Under the government’s pending financial services bill, the Financial Conduct Authority will be in charge of making sure the UK’s largest banking and building societies give consumers access to withdrawal and deposit facilities such as ATMs within a “reasonable” distance from their community. The Guardian understands the FCA could dole out fines if lenders fail to maintain those facilities in line with the legislation, though what counts as a reasonable distance has not yet been confirmed. The rules will also stop short of protecting bank branches, and will more likely mean that banks provide access to free-to-use ATMs, Post Offices or mobile banking hubs. News came as Lloyds Banking Group – which also owns the Halifax and Bank of Scotland brands – confirmed plans to close a further 28 branches, leaving the group with 1,387 sites across the UK. About 5,000 bank and building society branches have disappeared from UK high streets since 2015, resulting in a near halving of the UK’s branch network, according to the Which? consumer group. The government’s announcement on the FCA was welcomed by campaigners who have long warned that the UK’s dwindling cash facilities are putting elderly and vulnerable people, who struggle to maintain bank accounts online, at risk. Access to cash has also become more important during banking outages, which can block card transactions and online bank transfers. About 5.4 million adults use and rely on cash on a daily basis, the Treasury said. Natalie Ceeney, chair of the Access to Cash Review and Cash Action Group, said she was pleased to see the government acting quickly after the Queen’s speech last week. “We need to see the consultation response in full to have a better understanding on how the legislation will work in practice,” she said. “What’s important is that a lot of work has gone into this over the past few years and I am pleased that parties of all colours recognise the importance of access to cash. It is vital that we all work together to get the best outcome for consumers and small businesses.”",Lifestyle/Money,City watchdog to ensure banks provide access to cash across UK,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/18/city-watchdog-to-ensure-banks-provide-access-to-cash-across-uk
