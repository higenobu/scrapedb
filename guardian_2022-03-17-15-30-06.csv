3/17/2022,"An app produced by the Malaysian government that promised to help the LGBTI community “return to nature” has been removed from the Google Play store, after it was found to be in breach of the platform’s guidelines. The app was first released in July 2016, but attracted fresh attention after it was shared on Twitter by the Malaysian government’s Islamic development department. It claimed the app would enable LGBTI people to return to a state of nature or purity, and that it included an e-book detailing the experience of a gay man who “abandoned homosexual behaviour” during Ramadan. When approached by the Guardian, Google said in a statement: “Whenever an app is flagged to us, we investigate against our Play store policies and if violations are found we take appropriate action to maintain a trusted experience for all.” The app has since been removed from the Play store. Its guidelines do not allow apps “that attempt to deceive users or enable dishonest behavior including but not limited to apps which are determined to be functionally impossible.” Malaysia’s Islamic development department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rachel Chhoa-Howard, Amnesty International’s Malaysia researcher, said such material was dangerous and hateful. “Conversion therapy is a deeply discriminatory and harmful practice which can cause long-lasting damage to those who are subject to it. It has been criminalised in many countries. We call on the Malaysian authorities to immediately abandon its use of Hijrah Diri, and instead ensure respect and protect LGBTI rights in the country,” she said. Numan Afifi, the founder of LGBT+ rights group Pelangi Campaign, said Google and other platforms should improve the moderation of content they host on their platforms. Community groups that try to counter harmful material already face an uphill battle, he added, including the risk of surveillance, censorship and raids on in-person gatherings. “Now that the general election is looming I am pretty sure that the demonisation of the LGBT community is going to get more intense, especially among those who are trying to [win] conservative votes,” he said. Malaysia’s LGBTI community faces widespread discrimination, including laws that ban same-sex relations and non-normative gender expression. The Play store has previously removed an app from a US-based group Living Hope Ministries that promoted so-called “conversion therapy”.

3/17/2022,"Experts have called on the New South Wales government to reintroduce mandatory face masks in high-risk settings as Covid-19 infections spike across the state. NSW reported its second day in a row of cases above 20,000, with 20,087 cases recorded in the 24 hours to 4pm on Wednesday and an estimated 20,402 the day before. NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, warned the number could double by next month. The Australian Medical Association’s NSW president, Dr Danielle McMullen, said the spread of the more infectious BA.2 Omicron subvariant is a concern and the government should follow public health advice. “Our advice throughout the pandemic has been that masks are a simple and effective way to reduce infection,” she said. Last week Hazzard reportedly rejected NSW Health’s recommendations to again mandate wearing masks indoors, density limits, a ban on singing and dancing, and a return to working from home. NSW Health refused to confirm whether it recommended mandates be reintroduced now, or once cases reached a certain point. Prof Alexandra Martiniuk, an epidemiologist at the University of Sydney, said given that millions of eligible Australians are yet to receive their third Covid-19 vaccine dose, reintroducing some restrictions may be necessary. She added that the NSW health system is still under pressure with more than 2,500 health workers in isolation and unable to work this week. “As we saw with the first wave of Omicron, even if sickness doesn’t slow up society, the sheer number of people needing to isolate due to being Covid-19-positive can cause challenges,” Martiniuk said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But Prof Catherine Bennett, chair of epidemiology at Deakin University, disagreed that masks should be mandated again yet, arguing they should instead be “strongly encouraged”as NSW’s ICU rates remained stable. Many Australians have also contracted Covid-19 in recent months so have increased protection against the BA.2 subvariant. On Thursday there were 34 people in ICU in NSW, the lowest rate since 25 December. “If we see numbers push up and translate into hospitalisations, then we should look at the rules again,” Bennett said. “That said, not having rules doesn’t mean don’t wear a mask. There will be people who feel more comfortable wearing a mask for a number of reasons and you can do this without mandates in place.”",News/Australia news,"More than 20,000 Covid cases in NSW as some experts call for reintroducing mask mandate",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/17/more-than-20000-covid-cases-in-nsw-as-some-experts-call-for-reintroducing-mask-mandate
3/17/2022,"Rishi Sunak last month merely claimed to be “taking the sting out” of the sharp rise in energy bills that will apply from the start of April. He was wise not to make a grander boast. Six weeks on, his £9bn support package, which in any case involved a fiddle with a £200 “rebate” that isn’t really a rebate because it is repayable later, looks grossly unequal to the size of the energy challenge. The first problem is the one highlighted by Gordon Brown, the former prime minister, and more than 70 Labour local government leaders today: the number of households in fuel poverty, defined as those spending at least 10% of their net income on energy, will rise from 4.7 million to almost 8 million next month. That figure, note, is calculated after adjusting for Sunak’s measures that offered straightforward support: the £150 reduction for council tax payers in bands A and D, for example, and the widening of the eligibility for the warm homes discount. In other words, the sting will still be severe for low-income households. Brown and co suggest a series of responses, including capping next month’s national insurance increase, restoring the £20-a-week increase in universal credit and uprating benefits in line with inflation. All should be on the table in the spring statement. The second problem, though, is potentially enormous: when the energy price cap is next revised in October, the mechanical model is likely to spit out a truly astronomical figure. Barring a rapid and miraculous plunge in wholesale gas prices, the next cap is currently projected by analysts to come out at close to £3,000. That would make April’s £1,971, seen as shocking when regulator Ofgem published it last month, feel almost gentle. It’s obviously not Sunak’s fault that gas prices have soared (again) after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but the chancellor looks to have assembled his original £9bn support package on the hopeful premise that something like “normal” energy prices would return in time for next winter and that a muddle-through approach would suffice during the summer months of low consumption. It’s time to abandon such wishful thinking. More artful fiddles with “rebates” will not cut it. Nor would further expansion of eligibility for the warm homes scheme – extending a £150-a-year discount to more people is little more than tokenism if the price cap ends up being hiked by another £1,000. Universal credit is the most direct and effective means to boost support, and is the obvious policy tool to use. Alternatively, lift benefits, currently due to rise by only 3.1%, or raise national insurance thresholds, or a combination of the above. The important thing is to signal action in response to an energy crisis that is only intensifying. The original bits-and-pieces support package for low-income households is out of date already. It needs a complete re-design. Inflation is upon us – especially in companies’ use of the phrase “mitigating actions”. Fever-Tree, the tonic firm, and the Restaurant Group, owner of the Wagamama and Frankie & Benny’s chains, sprinkled the words across their results statements on Wednesday as they faced up to higher input costs. Both, however, left the impression that mitigation will only get you so far. The commodity prices that bother Fever-Tree are primarily aluminium for cans and glass for bottles. The firm can move some production to local markets and try to duck a few logistics costs, but “significant uncertainty in relation to input costs” translated to a downgrade of approximately £6m in the top-line profit forecast (now £63m-£66m) for 2022. That’s despite the revenue line continuing to skip along nicely as Fever-Tree makes waves in the US. Shareholders got a £50m special dividend to ease the slimline feeling. Over at TRG, the mitigating actions sounded like things the company would do anyway – tweak the “labour deployment model” to take account of dine-in versus takeaway trends, and have a chat with suppliers to see if there are volume-related deals to be done. The group predicted cost inflation in food and drink of 5%-plus, which sounded almost benign until it added that the calculation was before “any consequential inflationary impacts arising from the conflict in Ukraine”. Well, yes, that is the big unknown for the entire food industry.

3/17/2022,"Nearly 90% of former Debenhams stores remain empty almost a year after the department store closed its doors for the last time, in a sign of the challenge to reinvent high streets across the country. The empty shops are among nearly 8,000 outlets left empty last year, according to a report by the high street analysts Local Data Company (LDC), as Covid lockdowns accelerated the shift towards shopping online and pummelled city centres. However, that was down from 11,319 net closures in 2020, as fewer businesses fell into administration, while more than 43,000 new businesses opened, an increase of more than 10%. Fast-food outlets, barbers, grocery stores, cafes and beauty salons were the fastest-growing sectors, as independent businesses took advantage of cheaper rents to launch. There was also a significant bounce-back in the leisure industry, with a net 52 outlets closing compared with 2,640 a year earlier, as restrictions on dining out eased and takeaway businesses continued to boom. Clothing stores, banks, charity shops and pubs were hardest hit. Lucy Stainton, the commercial director at LDC, said department stores were a particular problem, with only 12% of recently vacated sites now reoccupied, while just over a fifth of former BHS outlets remained empty five years after the department store collapsed as a result of the costs of fitting out and maintaining such large sites. She said landlords and councils would have to think beyond retail to fill the space as there was a “knock-on impact” on the attractiveness of a town or shopping centre when key sites remained vacant. Projects under way include the transformation of the former Debenhams in Gloucester into a student campus, while Manchester’s Kendals building, home to House of Fraser, is to be converted into offices. There are signs of recovery as landlords redevelop empty buildings to adapt to a new shopping and leisure landscape at a rapid pace. The proportion of vacant premises slipped to 14.4% from 14.5% after six years of increases. More than 9,100 retail and leisure premises were redeveloped in 2021, up nearly 49% on the year before. However, 5% of high street outlets have remained empty for more than three years and 6% of those in shopping centres, according to the report. LDC predicts a gradual reduction in the vacancy rate over the next few years, but is not expecting a swift return to pre-pandemic levels. It said “drastic action” was needed to adapt shopping destinations, including more redevelopment – and there could be a net 9,000 reduction in the number of shops and high street services such as banks and leisure businesses next year. The report flags the end of the commercial rent moratorium, business rates relief and grants for occupiers and local authorities this spring, as well as inflation driven by higher costs for retailers, rising interest rates and a national insurance increase. It says these factors are “likely to make 2022 another challenging year for occupiers across the retail sector”.",News/Business,Almost 90% of Debenhams stores still lie empty a year after collapse,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/17/empty-department-stores-slow-revival-covid-stricken-high-streets
3/17/2022,"New laws to make it easier to expel Russian spies and other foreign agents need to be urgently speeded up in light of the Ukraine crisis, opposition parties said on Wednesday, with the UK lagging behind other nations in tackling interference. Labour, the Lib Dems and the Tory chair of the foreign affairs committee called on the government to bring forward measures to force foreign agents to sign a register, which was promised in last year’s Queen’s speech as part of a new counter state threats bill. However, no such legislation has appeared and a consultation into the issue last July has not yet received a government response. The proposal for a register of foreign agents was put forward in the Russia report by the Intelligence and Security Committee, which released a statement earlier this week pointing out that not all of its recommendations have been implemented. The government fast-tracked its economic crime bill to help speed up sanctions against oligarchs this week, but the bill to deal with espionage has never been published, even in draft form. Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chair of the foreign affairs committee, said: “This is an essential piece of legislation for keeping our country safe. We know foreign influence has had a damaging effect on our country and while we need to be open to the world, we need to protect our interests.” He also questioned why the UK had not expelled Russian diplomats, including the ambassador. “It seems strange that we have maintained full diplomatic relations with Russia. While we need to keep avenues open, it seems questionable we should maintain ambassadors. I wouldn’t close their embassy but I would expel their ambassador.” Since Russia invaded Ukraine, the US has expelled 12 Russian diplomats that it accuses of being spies and the Kremlin is also reportedly considering a foreign agents register. The UK has not expelled any Russian diplomats or spies since the invasion of Ukraine, in contrast to its reaction after the Salisbury poisonings and Litvinenko case. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said: “For too long our democracy has been open to foreign interference, and the government has failed to act. “Labour has been calling for foreign agent registration law to be brought forward for some time but there have still been many delays despite this being a strong recommendation in the Russia report. “It should never have taken Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine to force the government into action on economic crime. Ministers must now finally act on foreign agent registration without delay.” The Lib Dems also said they would be willing to sit through weekends and recess in order to pass such legislation before the end of this current parliamentary session, which is due to end in April. Layla Moran, the party’s foreign affairs spokesperson, said: “It’s deeply concerning that we could be waiting for up to another year for these vital measures. We all know that the existing counter-espionage legislation is unfit for the 2020s. If ever there was a time to update it, it’s now. “We should keep all options on the table to resolve the crisis in Ukraine – including the expulsion of diplomats from the UK. The difficulty is that with legislation as it stands, those choices are limited. “Just as the government fast-tracked the economic crime (ransparency and enforcement) bill, they could do so with these additional measures. The Liberal Democrats stand ready to sit over weekends and Easter recess to get these vital measures through as quickly as possible.” Chris Bryant, the Labour MP and former Foreign Office minister, said the government appeared to be “utterly incompetent or lazy” for having not brought the legislation forward. “The Queen’s speech had a commitment to it and we’re near the end of the session and it has still not happened,” he said. He said Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, had not given MPs a proper answer as to why the UK was not expelling diplomats from London. “I think we should be degrading the Russian embassy here and preventing it from operating as much as we can,” he said. “We should have been ready for Ukraine. They’ve not got their ducks in a row and it’s shocking.” He also highlighted the case of Christine Lee, who was accused by MI5 of being a Chinese agent, but who is not being prosecuted or expelled. An unprecedented security warning from MI5 was circulated to MPs and peers in January saying the lawyer was seeking to improperly influence parliamentarians on behalf of China’s ruling Communist party. The Chinese embassy in London rejected the claims saying China “always adheres to the principle of non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs”. The Home Office has been approached for comment.",News/UK news,New laws to enable expulsion of Russian spies need to be ‘urgently speeded up’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/17/new-laws-to-enable-expulsion-of-russian-spies-need-to-be-urgently-speeded-up
3/17/2022,"The child poverty rate in the US has improved dramatically because of expansions of the social safety net during the Covid-19 pandemic, but experts are warning that allowing such measures to expire may reverse these historic gains. While the pandemic put pressure on the wellbeing of millions of children, new measures greatly improved child welfare. The child poverty rate decreased from 14.2% in 2018 to less than 5.6% in 2021, and the rate of severe poverty was cut nearly in half, according to projections. “​​Child poverty in the United States is not inevitable. It is a choice,” said Lisa Chamberlain, a professor of pediatrics at the Stanford School of Medicine and co-author of a perspective published on Monday in the journal Jama Pediatrics. “It’s not a question of how to do this – it’s a question of political will.” The child tax credit, the primary driver of these changes, reduced child poverty by an estimated 40%. Starting in July, it provided monthly checks to families. The vast majority of these funds paid for basic necessities, including food, clothing, shelter, utilities and education. Other safety-net expansions in the pandemic included three stimulus checks, a moratorium on evictions, increased unemployment benefits and more funding for food, through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), and housing. “The expansion of all of those really caused a historic decline in child poverty,” Chamberlain said. Without this support, nearly a third of children would be living in poverty, according to research. The benefits “have made a huge difference – not just preventing what could have been the worst-case scenario in terms of poverty rises, but actually resulting in dramatically lower poverty rates than we’ve seen in decades”, said Megan Curran, policy director at Columbia University’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy. The child poverty rate in 2020 was the lowest since the US Census Bureau started measuring in the 1960s, and 2021 may have been even lower, she said. “So that’s huge.” But the child tax credit expired in January, plunging an estimated 3.7 million children into poverty – a 41% increase from December, according to the center’s analysis. “There was essentially a cliff between December 2021 and January 2022,” Curran said. “Without the payments, families have definitely been hurting in the last two months.” Families are again struggling to buy food, pay rent and keep the lights on, particularly as food and energy costs have risen. “It’s a double hit that they’re experiencing, which is the loss of the payments and increased prices for those essentials as well,” Curran said. The Build Back Better bill would have extended the credit, but it stalled in the US Senate after opposition from the Democratic senator Joe Manchin, who cited the child tax credit as one of his reasons for quashing the bill. There is an enormous economic benefit to reducing child poverty, research shows. Poverty can lead to hunger, poor health, poorer education and worse job prospects. “Not having enough food, not having stable places to live – all of that disrupts their ability to really engage with school,” Chamberlain said. “The ability to engage in the classroom, to engage in their educational process, is what ultimately takes them to their final potential of being able to have a good job and contribute.” Child poverty costs the US between $800bn and $1.1tn each year because of lost adult productivity and the increased costs of health and criminal justice spending, according to the National Academy of Sciences. Poverty reduction programs have strong moral and economic rationales, researchers say. “Child poverty is actually costing us, as a country, an incredible amount every year,” Curran said. “Cutting child poverty dramatically not just helps kids on a personal level and a family level, but it also makes sense economically speaking.” Some opponents have argued that the credit might discourage families from working, but research shows there was no discernible effect on employment. In fact, the researchers said, the money could be used for childcare, which allows parents to work more – particularly during the pandemic, when many informal caregivers, like grandparents, were lost to death and disability. “The number of incapacitations from Covid for that has been really, really difficult – and we have seen enormous numbers of women leave the workforce,” Chamberlain said. With the expiration of the child tax credit, such progress is now threatened. “I would not say it wipes out the gains,” Chamberlain said. “It eliminates our ability to keep getting those gains.” For the months the families received the credit, they had more food, stable housing, less stress – and greater developmental benefits for children. “If they can continue to extend this, we can continue to see that happen.” The immediate success of the program is a proof of concept, especially because it’s unusual for a single policy to show such clear and stark gains, Curran said. “We’ve shown now that all of this – high poverty, rising poverty – is completely reversible,” she said. “We know now what works, and we’ve seen it working.”",News/US news,"Action needed to keep US child poverty rate from rising again, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/17/us-child-poverty-rate-welfare-measures-expire-experts
3/17/2022,"Early in the pandemic, several international publishers – with good intentions, no doubt – posted tweets claiming that the lockdown probably would not make a huge difference for fiction writers, who are, as a general rule, solitary creatures, used to working from home. Not knowing office work or team effort, novelists would be less affected by the changes brought about by Covid. My experience, however, has been the opposite. The pandemic upended life as we knew it; authors and artists were not outside the struggles of wider society. Just because we are hopeless introverts doesn’t mean we were not thrust into a liquid world along with everyone else. This is a major crossroads for all of us – shaped by the pandemic but also the urgency of climate destruction, growing inequalities and conflict on the European continent and beyond. The decisions that we make now will determine the quality of life for generations to come. None of us has the luxury of being disconnected, disengaged or numb. In my latest novel, The Island of Missing Trees, one of the characters says something that I keep churning in my mind: “There are moments in life when everyone has to become a warrior of some kind. If you are a poet, you fight with your words. If you are a painter, you fight with your paintings … but you cannot say, ‘Sorry I am a poet, I’ll pass.’ You don’t say that when there is so much suffering, inequality, injustice.” Ours is the age of anxiety, and many of us are struggling with negative emotions ranging from anger to fear, frustration and confusion. It is emotionally taxing, but if this were to evolve into the age of apathy, it would bea much harder and darker world to live in. At the heart of our most vital present debates is a set of basic concepts which have been taken for granted for too long: democracy, society, family, freedom. What do these words mean, exactly? This is a time when our most fundamental terminology needs to be defined and redefined. Despite what Thatcher, Reagan and their international counterparts claimed under the banner of the New Right, there is such a thing as “society”. The pandemic made clear that we are not atomised individuals each occupying our own little corner of the free market. At the root of the word “society” is the Latin societas, from socius – companion. When we define what a society is, we are also defining who is a part of “us” – and who, therefore, is not. This world of polarisations and constant tension does not encourage us to celebrate diversity, pluralism and multiplicity. We are constantly reduced and pushed into monolithic boxes. The word “identity” is too deeply and stubbornly associated with uniformity and sameness – but in truth, identity is more fluid than solid, more diverse than homogeneous. It does not have to be reductionist; it can grow and expand, like ripples in water. The early Stoic philosopher Hierocles developed the idea of oikeiôsis, a theory of belonging represented by concentric circles. The innermost circle represents the individual, with the surrounding circles symbolising immediate family, extended family, townspeople, countrymen, citizens of the land and, finally, humanity as a whole. The pandemic was a good time to embrace this idea. In the face of death and disease, we could have recognised our common humanity and interconnectivity like never before. Yet, while to some degree this was achieved, we also ended up with another type of division and duality: vaccine nationalism. Richer countries hoarded vaccines while large swathes of people across the world had barely any access to such protection. Then came war on the European continent and a horrific humanitarian crisis following Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Again, instead of bringing people together and uniting around common values, populist demagogues are busy dividing humanity. The response of the European public towards Ukrainian refugees gives me hope, but if we cannot show the same solidarity and sensitivity to other refugees – from Syria or Afghanistan, or the climate refugees of the future – we are not learning the lessons of our times. That lesson is that we are a family, undivided by religion or race or geographical proximity. We are an international community. But it is this notion of humanity as family that is being attacked right now, from the terrified women and children in basement shelters across Ukrainian cities to women’s rights activists in Afghanistan, human rights activists in Syria, climate activists in Brazil and LGBTQ+ activists in Bangladesh. We have entered a new era, with massive global challenges ahead of us. We cannot deal with these challenges by reviving the forces of isolationism, tribalism and a me-first approach. Likewise, we cannot be single-issue people: if you care about climate injustice, you also need to care about gender injustice. Women and children are affected disproportionately by environmental destruction, and whenever there is massive displacement, there is also an alarming increase in sexual violence and gender discrimination. If you care about gender inequality, you should also care about racial inequality, class inequality, regional inequality and so on. Unless we connect the dots, nothing will improve. I am sick and tired of culture wars and the way they are stoked by politicians in power. In a time of real war, we cannot afford to be divided. Too much is at stake. Time to abandon, once and for all, populist myths of identity that have been used to divide people and keep them apart. The pandemic made it urgent to appreciate the immaterial things in life: family, friendship, sisterhood.

3/17/2022,"One in five pensioners – more than 2 million people – are living in relative poverty in the UK, an increase of more than 200,000 in the past year alone, according to a comprehensive review of national data. The Centre for Ageing Better’s annual State of Ageing report, published on Thursday, says inequalities within older generations are some of the most extreme in society today: the wealth of the richest 20% doubled between 2002 and 2018, while that of the poorest 20% fell by 30%. In a YouGov poll commissioned by the charity, more than 80% of respondents said the government was failing to ensure a decent life for older people. More than two-thirds of 2,000 adults in England surveyed supported the appointment of an independent commissioner to look after the rights of older people. There are differences of up to 10 years in the lifespan of rich and poor pensioners, and more than 17 years’ difference in the time that pensioners get in good health without a disabling illness, the report says. With the population ageing rapidly, the number of people at risk is growing at an alarming rate, the report says. There are almost 11 million people aged 65 and over in England today, 19% of the total population. In 10 years’ time this will have increased to more than 13 million people, 22% of the population. Dr Carole Easton, the chief executive of the Centre for Ageing Better, said: “Ageing is not exclusive to older people. We are all ageing, all the time. We all have that in common. But what is not shared is how we’ll age, and where we’ll end up in our older age.” While a financially secure and healthy later life is becoming increasingly unlikely for millions of people across England, experts are concerned those who have not yet reached pension age will face even greater financial challenges in retirement. Caroline Abrahams, the charity director at Age UK, said: “The numbers of older people living below the poverty line seem to be inexorably rising. It’s these older people, and others whose incomes take them just above the poverty line, who are being badly hurt by the surge in energy prices. “There is no obvious way out for them if they can’t afford their bills, except to economise on other essentials, but that’s the recipe for a miserable existence and one that can even put their health at risk.” Peter Matejic, the deputy director of evidence and impact at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said pensioner poverty was a “political choice” made by the government despite its stated ambition to reduce inequalities and increase healthy life expectancy by five years. “The fact that as a nation we have managed to successfully tackle pensioner poverty before shows that failing to do so now is a matter of political choice,” he said. “The chancellor should be taking decisive action in his spring statement next week to protect those most exposed to the coming increases in the cost of essentials, while also protecting pensioner incomes for the long term.” Experts are concerned that people who have not yet reached pension age will fare even worse in retirement. The proportion of older people aged 55 to 64 who rent rather than own their home has reached an all-time high of 11%, compared with 6% a decade ago. The report lays bare the impact the pandemic has had on reversing progress on older worker employment. The state pension age has risen to 66 but employment rates among people approaching retirement age have fallen to their lowest levels since 2016. The report says that after decades of narrowing, the employment rate gap between older and younger workers is now wider than two years ago. The number of people aged 50 to 64 who are not working or looking for work has increased by 228,000 since the start of the pandemic. The employment rate in this group has fallen by 1.8 percentage points. “These trends are entirely at odds with the government’s ambitions to extend working lives, raise the state pension age, boost productivity and level up the UK,” Easton said. “But they reflect the reality for many individuals who feel shut out, undervalued and financially disadvantaged by an ageist labour market.”",News/Society,"Number of pensioners in relative poverty in UK up 200,000 in a year",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/17/number-of-pensioners-in-relative-poverty-in-uk-up-200000-in-a-year
3/17/2022,"Anew 184-bed private hospital is about to open in London, the second-largest in the capital, where patients will enjoy views of Buckingham Palace and will be treated by doctors understood to be paid up to £350,000 a year. It provides a stark contrast with the NHS, which is buckling under the strain of record waiting lists, backlogs for cancer care and routine operations and a resurgence of Covid cases that is putting pressure on wards and staffing. The opening of the Ohio-based Cleveland Clinic’s first London hospital at the end of this month comes at a time when the private health sector is booming. With 29 intensive care unit beds and eight operating theatres staffed by 1,200 people, the eight-storey site – estimated by analysts to have cost £1bn – will add to concerns about the emergence of a two-tier healthcare system. Among London’s 19 private hospitals, it will be second biggest after the Wellington hospital in St John’s Wood, which is run by the US company HCA. Specialising in neurology, cardiology, orthopaedics and digestive care, the new hospital boasts a neurosurgical operating theatre twice the usual size, with an MRI scanner in the room beside it – allowing the surgeon to wheel a patient over during an operation to check whether a brain tumour or other abnormalities have been completely removed. The only other UK facility with this setup is the NHS National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Bloomsbury, central London. In other hospitals, more surgery is required when further abnormalities are discovered in the weeks after an operation. Unlike other British hospitals, Cleveland Clinic London has a pharmacy robot that laser-cuts strips of tablets into single doses and adds a barcode. These are then administered to patients via automated dispensing cabinets, with the aim of reducing errors and wastage. About 270 consultants will be working at the new site, the vast majority of whom also work for the NHS, and will typically spend one to two days a week at the clinic. The company has reportedly offered most of them fixed salaries of up to £350,000 a year, rather than the fee-per-service basis common in the private sector, triggering a recruitment war. Generally, the private sector’s fees for “rain makers” – top-level consultants – resemble “football-level salaries”, according to Ted Townsend, an analyst at the London-based consultancy LaingBuisson. Some earn up to £500,000 a year from a combination of private and NHS pay, clinical excellence awards and professorships, he said. The new hospital will also employ 450 nurses, with more than half coming from other private operators or from Cleveland Clinic’s hospitals in Abu Dhabi and Cleveland, with the rest having moved over from the NHS, which employs 300,000 overall and is facing nursing staff shortages. The company’s chief executive, Tom Mihaljevic, who flew over from Ohio for the unveiling of the new hospital, joked that it would not charge extra for its rooms with a view of Buckingham Palace. He said: “We take care of very complex and sick patients. People come to Cleveland Clinic when they run out of hope.” While targeting UK patients with private health insurance or the growing number of people who are paying for treatment themselves, along with overseas patients, the Cleveland Clinic London is also in talks about providing complex procedures for NHS patients to help reduce waiting lists. Brian Donley, a former orthopaedic surgeon who is now chief executive of the clinic, said: “We are in those discussions with all different parts of London, with different NHS trusts on how we can support [reducing] that backlog. We do expect to see some NHS patients, in particular around complex care, in particular around diagnostics.” A spokesperson said these would mainly be tests for heart disease. A number of London NHS trusts have come to rely more on the private sector during the pandemic. HCA, which has six London hospitals, provided an unprecedented amount of cancer care, cardiology and other services to several NHS trusts in the capital last year. David Rowland, the director of the thinktank Centre for Health and the Public Interest, said: “The worry is the two-tier health system. London has always been the centre of the private hospital market. An estimated £1bn investment in a single hospital is a sign of how strongly foreign investors are betting against the NHS being able to meet the future health needs of the population. And the government seems entirely relaxed about this shift.” Rowland added that “the pulling away of NHS consultants and nurses is problematic. Private companies are paying significantly more.” He pointed to ophthalmology, where growing numbers of consultants are leaving NHS jobs to join large private companies. Cleveland Clinic is partly banking on the return to London of overseas patients – known as “embassy patients” as foreign embassies often pay for their treatment. They have been slow to come back since the pandemic, but travel restrictions to the UK have now been relaxed by Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Qatar – all leading sources of private patients. The US group, which has 22 hospitals and 226 outpatient centres globally, was founded in 1921 as a non-profit group and has no shareholders, which means profits are ploughed back into the business, in a similar way to the British health companies Bupa and Nuffield Health. The private sector has been criticised for using consultants and nurses that have been trained by the NHS, paid for by the UK taxpayer. Cleveland Clinic is trying to address this and has partnerships to train 150 student nurses, and to host neurology PhD students in its hospital. It will also let junior NHS doctors work there to gain expertise, its chief commercial officer, Will Rowberry, said.",News/Society,‘Betting against the NHS’: £1bn private hospital to open in central London,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/17/betting-against-the-nhs-1bn-private-hospital-to-open-in-central-london
3/17/2022,"Ministers are failing to protect people trafficked to Britain as modern slaves, the government’s own expert has said. Sara Thornton, the UK’s independent anti-slavery commissioner, said the law needed changing so those established as victims of traffickers would be more likely to be granted protection and allowed to stay in the UK. In a piece for the Guardian, she says that currently just one in 12 are allowed to stay, with some others being returned back into potential danger. Thornton, a former senior police chief constable, said some Home Office decisions were not just unfair but contain basic errors. Her intervention comes with the Home Office under fire over its handling of the Ukrainian refugee crisis, with the government accused of getting it wrong. Thornton’s remarks also come as parliament debates the nationalities and borders bill, including an amendment that would increase the chances that those trafficked could stay. In her Guardian piece, Thornton says: “People who are vulnerable due to circumstances of poverty, instability or forced migration are taken advantage of and exploited in situations of unfree labour, trafficking and abuse. “Women and girls fleeing war are particularly at risk and I am concerned about the possibility of trafficking for migrants as the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine unfolds.” She continues: “Given all of this, you might expect that the UK government and the Home Office were doing all they could to help victims of modern slavery in Britain. You would be wrong.” Theresa May while prime minister committed the government to crack down on modern slavery. Thornton says those promises are not being met: “However, the number of victims of trafficking granted temporary leave remains extremely low – thanks to a freedom of information request from the children’s rights charity Ecpat, we know just 8% of applications were granted in 2021.” The home office hit back at Thornton. A spokesperson said: “We reject these misleading claims. The UK leads the way in tackling the injustice of modern slavery and we have identified and supported thousands of victims to rebuild their lives, while putting those responsible for these crimes behind bars. “We are committed to ensuring victims receive the care and compassion they need through schemes such as the National Referral Mechanism, which helps to identify potential victims and aid their recovery. “We will go even further through the Nationality and Borders Bill to put victims’ rights into law and set out a new government strategy to tackle this heinous crime later this year.” In her piece the anti-slavery commissioner cites a case of a woman from Eritrea, whom she calls Jane, who suffered abuse and was confirmed as a victim: “Despite this, temporary leave to remain was not judged necessary to protect and assist in her recovery.” Thornton said the letter rejecting Jane’s plea to stay referred to her as a man throughout and adds the Home Office “cherrypicked” evidence to back its decision to refuse permission to stay, while seeming to ignore evidence to the contrary. Thornton calls for “a more generous approach to vulnerable and traumatised victims of the most serious crimes”. She stands down from her post next month. Thornton was the chief constable of the Thames Valley force who became the first chair of the National Police Chiefs Council.",News/UK news,Ministers ‘failing to protect’ people trafficked to UK as modern slaves,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/17/ministers-failing-to-protect-people-trafficked-to-uk-as-modern-slaves
3/17/2022,"Ministers have set out plans to cap the costs of libel lawsuits and force claimants to prove “actual malice” in an attempt to deter legal action often used by Russian oligarchs to intimidate journalists and block publication of their links to Vladimir Putin. The UK government said it would seek legal reforms to discourage so-called strategic lawsuits against public participation (Slapps). Such lawsuits can be pursued by corporations or individuals with deep pockets, with the aim of deterring investigation and scrutiny by threatening years of costly and time-consuming legal action. Journalists, activists and publishers have described the use of courts for Slapps as “lawfare” when complainants can absorb the costs with ease, regardless of whether they win, but where the legal action stymies those pursuing investigations. There is no specific definition of a Slapp lawsuit but two high-profile cases in recent months have apparently made ministers determined to act. The former Financial Times journalist Catherine Belton, the author of Putin’s People, faced five lawsuits from Russian oligarchs and firms, including Roman Abramovich, Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven. All three have had sanctions placed on them since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began. Tom Burgis, author of Kleptopia: How Dirty Money Is Conquering the World, was also sued by Kazakh mining group ENRC in a high-profile case thrown out by the high court earlier this month and subsequently dropped. Belton and Burgis have described the psychological pressure placed on them by the lawsuits, including at a foreign affairs select committee hearing on Wednesday. In recent weeks, journalists who referred to the possible imposition of sanctions on Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea football club, and his alleged connections to Putin have received legal letters warning of the risk of defamation. Last week the UK government hit Abramovich with sanctions. On Thursday the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, is to set out a consultation that will take evidence on how the government can change English law, as revealed by the Guardian last week. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, has also underlined the government’s intention to stop the use of the courts by Russian oligarchs to intimidate journalists. Options under consideration include reform of the Defamation Act 2013 to strengthen the “public interest defence” journalists and campaigners can use as a reason for publishing private information. Stronger action would include capping the costs that claimants can recover and introducing a specific requirement for claimants to prove “actual malice” by a defendant in libel cases, to deter spurious claims. The government is also considering changes to let courts throw out claims earlier in proceedings and consider imposing civil restraint orders to prevent individuals bringing repeated legal challenges. The former cabinet minister David Davis, who has campaigned to curb the use of Slapps, said he believed giving judges the ability to dismiss cases earlier in the process was the right way forward. “Most US state judges makes public interest ruling early on, before costs can rise exponentially,” he said. “I hope the government can do that. I would like to see an explicit public interest dimension to this.” Announcing the consultation, Boris Johnson said his experience as a journalist had made him determined to “never allow criticism to be silenced”. He said: “For the oligarchs and super-rich who can afford these sky-high costs the threat of legal action has become a new kind of lawfare. We must put a stop to its chilling effect.” Raab said: “The government will not tolerate Russian oligarchs and other corrupt elites abusing British courts to muzzle those who shine a light on their wrongdoing.” The National Union of Journalists’ general secretary, Michelle Stanistreet, said it would welcome reform to “ensure journalists and media outlets no longer have to face prohibitive costs and deliberate intimidation by wealthy litigants with the deepest of pockets”. Stephanie Boyce, president of the of England and Wales, said the use of Slapps has “long been controversial” and it was welcome for the government to “strengthen and clarify the rules”.",News/Law,UK to clamp down on libel ‘lawfare’ by the rich in English courts,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/17/libel-lawfare-english-courts-slapps
3/17/2022,"Weeks after the 2020 election, at least one Trump White House aide was named as secretly producing a report that alleged Donald Trump lost to Joe Biden because of Dominion Voting Systems – research that formed the basis of the former president’s wider efforts to overturn the election. The Dominion report, subtitled “OVERVIEW 12/2/20 – History, Executives, Vote Manipulation Ability and Design, Foreign Ties”, was initially prepared so that it could be sent to legislatures in states where the Trump White House was trying to have Biden’s win reversed. But top Trump officials would also use the research that stemmed from the White House aide-produced report to weigh other options to return Trump to the presidency, including having the former president sign off on executive orders to authorize sweeping emergency powers. The previously unreported involvement of the Trump White House aide in the preparation of the Dominion report raises the extraordinary situation of at least one administration official being among the original sources of Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The publicly available version of the Dominion report, which first surfaced in early December 2020 on the conservative outlet the Gateway Pundit, names on the cover and in metadata as its author Katherine Friess, a volunteer on the Trump post-election legal team. But the Dominion report was in fact produced by the senior Trump White House policy aide Joanna Miller, according to the original version of the document reviewed by the Guardian and a source familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The original version of the Dominion report named Miller - who worked for the senior Trump adviser Peter Navarro – as the author on the cover page, until her name was abruptly replaced with that of Friess before the document was to be released publicly, the source said. The involvement of a number of other Trump White House aides who worked in Navarro’s office was also scrubbed around that time, the source said. Friess has told the Daily Beast that she had nothing to do with the report and did not know how her name came to be on the document. It was not clear why Miller’s name was removed from the report, which was sent to Trump’s former attorney Rudy Giuliani on 29 November 2020, or why the White House aide’s involvement was obfuscated in the final 2 December version. Miller did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Dominion report made a number of unsubstantiated allegations that claimed Dominion Voting Systems corruptly ensured there could be “technology glitches which resulted in thousands of votes being added to Joe Biden’s total ballot count”. Citing unnamed Venezuelan officials, the report also pushed the conspiracy theory that Dominion Voting Systems used software from the election company Smartmatic and had ties to “state-run Venezuelan software and telecommunications companies”. After the Dominion report became public, Navarro incorporated the claims into his own three-part report, produced with assistance from his aides at the White House, including Miller and another policy aide, Garrett Ziegler, the source said. Ziegler has also said on a rightwing podcast that he and others in Navarro’s office – seemingly referring to Trump White House aides Christopher Abbott and Hannah Robertson – started working on Navarro’s report about two weeks before the 2020 election took place. “Two weeks before the election, we were doing those reports hoping that we would pepper the swing states with those,” Ziegler said of the three-part Navarro report in an appearance last July on The Professor’s Record with David K Clements. The research in the Dominion report also formed the backbone of foreign election interference claims by the former Trump lawyer and conspiracy theorist Sidney Powell, who argued Trump could, as a result, assume emergency presidential powers and suspend normal law. That included Trump’s executive order 13848, which authorized sweeping powers in the event of foreign election interference, as well as a draft executive order that would have authorized the seizure of voting machines, the Guardian has previously reported. The claims about Venezuela in the Dominion report appear to have spurred Powell to ask Trump at a 18 December 2020 meeting at the White House – coincidentally facilitated by Ziegler – that she be appointed special counsel to investigate election fraud. Miller’s authorship of the Dominion report was not the last time the Trump White House, or individuals in the administration, prepared materials to advance the former president’s claims about a stolen election and efforts to return himself to office. The House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack revealed last year it had found evidence the White House Communications Agency produced a letter for the Trump justice department official Jeffrey Clark to use to pressure states to decertify Biden’s election win.",News/US news,Trump White House aide was secret author of report used to push ‘big lie’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/16/trump-white-house-aide-secret-author-dominion-report
3/17/2022,"Friendlyjordies producer Kristo Langker is considering launching a civil case against the New South Wales police after charges laid against him for allegedly stalking the former deputy premier John Barilaro were dropped last week. While Langker hasn’t ruled out filing a complaint with the state’s police watchdog, his solicitor, Mark Davis, told the Guardian on Thursday that it should be the government that refers the “utterly frivolous” case. The comments come after the attorney general, Mark Speakman, told parliament on Wednesday he would wait to see whether whether “private citizens” would refer the matter before considering doing so himself. In June last year the Guardian revealed 21-year-old Langker had been arrested at his home in Dulwich Hill and charged with allegedly stalking and intimidating Barilaro, after the then politician was allegedly approached an event at Macquarie University and following the funeral of rugby league immortal Bob Fulton. The charges came just weeks after Barilaro sued Langker’s boss, the FriendlyJordies’ comedian Jordan Shanks, for defamation over what he described as a series of “vile and racist” videos that had brought him into “public disrepute, odium, ridicule and contempt”. In November last year Barilaro received an apology and legal costs, but no damages, when the lawsuit was settled out of court. Langker was charged with four counts of stalking or intimidating with intent to cause fear or physical harm by the NSW police’s fixated persons unit. A hearing was due in May this year after Langker plead not guilty. But police last week sensationally dropped the case, with the NSW police ordered to pay costs of $12,000 to Langker’s legal team. In NSW parliament budget estimates on Wednesday, Speakman was asked whether the case would be referred to the state’s police watchdog, the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission. Speakman told the hearing he believed there was “a fair chance” a referral would be made by another party, and that if that happened “I would not need to take further action”. But he did not rule out referring the arrest himself, saying if a complaint wasn’t made “then I will consider what is appropriate”. “I will see what private citizens do in the near future. If they do not, I will consider what action I should take in terms of a referral to the LECC,” he said. Speaking to the Guardian on Thursday, Davis did not rule out making a referral to the LECC, but hinted Langker is more likely to pursue a civil case against police over the case. “We’re not directly pursuing the LECC at this moment, we’ve got other recourse,” he said. “We will be seeking recourse for damages on not just Kristo but his family and the deep and genuine trauma for what they have endured over what in our view was an utterly frivolous … charge.” Davis suggested the attorney general should make the referral himself, saying: “It is a political issue and it’s something the parliament should be concerned about. “The LECC is an appropriate agency if anyone in parliament has concerns they should compel it to them,” he said. “It’s not our intention right at the moment to make a complaint to what is essentially another police agency. “Kristo and his family have been treated in the shabbiest manner imaginable and they don’t have great faith in any police agency.” Following his arrest, Langker’s lawyers claimed his mother had been assaulted during the arrest. Video footage uploaded to YouTube of the arrest includes a period of commotion in which the camera is lowered, and his mother can be heard exclaiming she was knocked over and that a police officer had assaulted her. A police officer can be heard in the video denying that accusation, saying he tripped over. Police have previously declined to comment on the assault allegation.",News/Australia news,Friendlyjordies producer Kristo Langker considers civil action over NSW arrest,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/17/friendlyjordies-producer-kristo-langker-considers-civil-action-over-nsw-arrest
3/17/2022,"Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has compared Russia’s brutal siege of the southern city of Mariupol to that of Leningrad in the second world war, amid fresh shelling in the capital Kyiv on Thursday and anger at the Kremlin after Joe Biden called Vladimir Putin a “war criminal”. Zelenskiy said late on Wednesday: “Citizens of Russia, how is your blockade of Mariupol different from the blockade of Leningrad during world war two? … We will not forget anyone whose lives were taken by the occupiers.” Between 1941 and 1944, German forces encircled and starved Leningrad, now called St Petersburg, leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. Zelenskiy said it was still unclear how many had died or been injured in the airstrike on a theatre in the city where hundreds of displaced people were believed to have been sheltering. Russia has also been accused of a strike on a swimming pool where pregnant women and young children had gathered and of shelling a convoy of cars carrying civilians fleeing the city. “Our hearts are broken by what Russia is doing to our people,” he said. Early on Thursday, one person was killed and three injured by a Russian missile attack on a residential building in Kyiv, Ukraine’s emergency services reported. Rescuers received a report of a building on fire in the Darnytsky district at 5.02am and found the 16th floor of the building was “demolished” and on fire. The southern port city of Mariupol has been facing a humanitarian catastrophe for days, and Russia continued its attacks on it and other Ukrainian cities on Wednesday, even as the two sides continued efforts at peace talks to negotiate an end to the fighting. Earlier, the US president voiced his view that his Russian counterpart was a war criminal, marking a significant change in his language. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, said Biden’s comments were “unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric”, according to Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency. In other developments: The US is to send an additional $800m in security assistance to Ukraine, including 800 anti-aircraft systems, 9,000 anti-armour systems, 20m rounds of ammunition and drones. The move came after Zelenskiy pleaded with Congress to do more, invoking the painful memories of Pearl Harbor and the September 11 terrorists attacks and echoing Martin Luther King’s call for a more peaceful future. Biden said afterwards that Ukrainians “have shown remarkable courage and strength in the face of brutal aggression”. Zelenskiy is to address Germany’s parliament on Thursday morning, and said he would “fight for ever greater support for Ukraine, for even greater pressure on Russia”. The UN security council will meet Thursday at the request of six western nations. The UK’s UN mission tweeted: “Russia is committing war crimes and targeting civilians. Russia’s illegal war on Ukraine is a threat to us all.” The meeting comes ahead of an expected vote on a Russian humanitarian resolution that has been sharply criticised for making no mention of Ukraine. More than 3 million people have now fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began, figures from the United Nation’s Refugee Agency (UNHCR) show. In Mariupol, the city council said a “bomb on a building where hundreds of peaceful Mariupol residents were hiding.” “We don’t know if there are any survivors,” one witness said. “The bomb shelter is also covered with debris … there are both adults and children there.” About 1,000 civilians were allegedly hiding inside the theatre, which was designated as a shelter for the displaced, including children and elderly people. Later Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of Donetsk regional administration, claimed Russians had also targeted the Neptune swimming pool. “Now there are pregnant women and women with children under the rubble there,” he said in a post on Telegram. “It is impossible to establish the number of casualties from these strikes.” A witness who posted a video of the aftermath of the attack said the pool had been destroyed and efforts were under way to rescue one pregnant woman trapped in the rubble. Moscow denies targeting civilians and Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had not struck the building, RIA news agency said. A satellite photograph from 14 March and released on Wednesday by Maxar Technologies showed the word “children” in large Russian script painted on the ground outside the red-roofed theatre building. Ukraine’s ministry of defence has described Mariupol as the worst front of the war. Mass graves have been dug on the outskirts of the city and the bodies of men, women and children have been left on the streets. More than 400,000 of its inhabitants are either without or with dwindling access to running water, food and medical supplies. Local officials have said more than 2,500 have been killed. But the reality is that, because of the shelling, the dead cannot be counted. Ukrainian officials also accused Russian forces of shelling a convoy of cars of civilians fleeing the city, wounding at least five people, including a child. Local officials shared photos and videos of the aftermath of the alleged attack. “Heavy artillery of the enemy forces fired on a convoy of civilians moving along the highway towards Zaporizhzhia,” the governor of the region, Oleksandr Starukh, said in an online post. More than 400 people, whom Ukrainian authorities have compared to hostages, remain trapped in a Mariupol hospital seized by Russian forces. “It is impossible to get out of the hospital,” one employee said on the Telegram social media platform. “They shoot hard, we sit in the basement. Cars have not been able to drive to the hospital for two days. High-rise buildings are burning around … Russians rushed 400 people from neighbouring houses to our hospital. We can’t leave.” Officials have told families to leave their dead outside in the streets because holding funerals is too dangerous. Witnesses tell of a city in chaos, under constant bombardment, which is becoming more and more difficult to escape. Thousands of people are trying to reach the city of Zaporizhzhia, where refugees are taking shelter, but according to the Ukrainian authorities, the Russians are trying to prevent citizens from fleeing. Taking Mariupol, which is 34 miles from Russia’s border, would mark a strategic breakthrough for Vladimir Putin. The city lies between territory held by Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas region and the Crimean peninsula, which was annexed by Moscow in 2014 and from where it has launched its assault on key southern towns in Ukraine.",News/World news,Ukraine’s Zelenskiy compares Mariupol to Leningrad siege as Russia launches fresh strikes on Kyiv,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/ukraines-zelenskiy-compares-mariupol-to-leningrad-siege-as-russia-launches-fresh-strikes-on-kyiv
3/17/2022,"Galanthophile: an enthusiastic acolyte, processing, dog attached, in the rites of spring, with an occult knowledge, enchanted, gathering photographs of woods whitewashed with snowdrops. Galanthus (milk flower) is the botanical genus containing about 20 species of snowdrops native to Europe and the Middle East. From only a few species grown widely there are hundreds of named varieties to excite the galanthophiles. At Attingham Park, signs say that there are only two types of snowdrops flowering in the wood: Galanthus elwesii – the larger snowdrop that ranges from Ukraine across Turkey into Syria; and Galanthus nivalis, Flore Pleno – a double-flowered form of the common snowdrop found throughout Europe, except the far north. This double form has a funky little flower with a muddle in the middle of its petal-like structure and bits missing. Flore Pleno is usually sterile and cannot form seeds, but it does produce a lot of pollen which can find its way into the wider population and hybridise with other G. nivalis plants; it can also cross the line with other species of snowdrops. In the 1990s, a double form of G. elwesii was found in Shropshire and called Godfrey Owen, after the husband of Margaret Owen who discovered it. Although they all seem more or less the same, snowdrops have subtle nuances of flower shape and colour – there are green ones and yellow ones – differences in leaf size and colour, flowering times. They invite the curiosity of those who love to discover the small signifiers of a much bigger story. Although the snowdrop narrative is always framed by references to when they were first cultivated or mentioned in literature and an assumption that they’re not indigenous or maybe they are native, it is not their legitimacy that is important but their presence. Whether spread by streams, floods, nuns, gardeners or owners of stately homes such as here at Attingham, snowdrops are full of wild beauty in the story of culture and cultivation. They have become a flower of public ritual. They fade, to vanish into a seasonal amnesia, until the end of next winter when they awake the galanthophile in us.
