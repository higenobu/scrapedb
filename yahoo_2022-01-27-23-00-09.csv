1/27/2022,"Elon Musk offered the owner of an account called ""Elon's Jet"" $5,000 to remove it, Protocol reported. The account uses public data to track the location of Musk's private jet. Its owner countered with an offer of $50,000 but has not heard back from Musk. Elon Musk messaged the owner of a Twitter account that tracks his private jet, with an offer of $5,000 if he took the account offline, tech news site Protocol reports. The ""Elon's Jet"" account shows the movements of Musk's private jet, using bots that monitor publicly available air traffic data. Per Protocol, the owner of the account, 19 year-old Jack Sweeney, received a message in fall last year at 12:13 a.m. from Musk. It said: ""Can you take this down? It is a security risk."" Sweeney replied: ""Yes I can but it'll cost you a Model 3 only joking unless?"" per Protocol. Musk said: ""I don't love the idea of being shot by a nutcase,"" according to Protocol. Musk offered Sweeney $5,000 after a few messages back and forth, Protocol reported. ""Any chance to up that to $50k? It would be great support in college and would possibly allow me to get a car maybe even a Model 3,"" Sweeney responded, per Protocol. According to the outlet, Musk said he would think about it but has not been back in touch. When Sweeney told Musk where he was aggregating the data from, Musk responded: ""Air traffic control is so primitive,"" Protocol reported. It's not clear whether Protocol viewed the Twitter messages. Musk tweeted earlier this month that social-media accounts tracking his movements are ""becoming a security issue."" Jack Sweeney did not immediately respond when contacted out-of-hours for comment. Insider was not immediately able to contact Elon Musk.

1/27/2022,"Michael Eric Dyson, Professor of African American and Diaspora Studies at Vanderbilt University, appeared on Don Lemon Tonight Wednesday, where he addressed comments made on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast on Tuesday. Rogan’s guest, psychologist and commentator Jordan Peterson, questioned Dyson’s Blackness because he is fairly light skinned. Peterson also questioned his own whiteness, trying to make the point that unless someone’s skin is literally black or literally white, then that person should not be called Black or white. In this context, Peterson said of Dyson, “He was brown, not Black.” “The Black and white thing is so weird because the shades are so — there’s such a spectrum of shades of people,” Rogan added. “Unless you’re talking to someone who is, like, 100% African, from the darkest place where they're not wearing any clothes all day and they've developed all that melanin to protect themselves from the sun, you know, even the term Black is weird. When you use it for people that are literally my color, it becomes very strange.” I think that's a deliberate, willful ignorance, and it's the unintentional hilarity of a certain kind of whiteness that refuses to own up to what it is.
Michael Eric Dyson Dyson explained for Rogan what Blackness means besides just the color of one’s skin. “We’re not talking about a genetic predisposition toward darker skin, we're speaking about an existential context,” Dyson said. “We're talking about a philosophical idea. We're speaking about rooted cultures in deep histories that have vast traditions that have generated complicated identities.” Dyson believes that Rogan, whose platform on Spotify was unsuccessfully challenged by rocker Neil Young just a day earlier over COVID misinformation on the podcast, is too smart to believe what was said. “Brother Rogan is smarter than that,” Dyson said. “People who are in Africa who don't wear clothes, who have deeper melanin? Was he speaking about thousands of years ago? Is he talking about today? When he refers to what it means to be African. When he refers to what it means to be Black. Are you that obtuse? Indifferent to truth? Ignorant about traditions?” What Dyson really found astonishing is that Rogan would make such comments after having opened for comedian Dave Chappelle. Dyson said he met Rogan at that show. “Joe Rogan, you're opening up for a guy who has redefined, for many people, Blackness in the last 15 years, and yet you're claiming not to know what Blackness is,” Dyson said. “Yeah, I think that's a deliberate, willful ignorance, and it's the unintentional hilarity of a certain kind of whiteness that refuses to own up to what it is.” Don Lemon Tonight airs weeknights at 10 p.m. on CNN.

1/27/2022,"After applying for loan forgiveness, I was notified that payments made before 2007 do not count. Answer: “You can, seemingly, do everything right — work in public service and make your payments — and still not get forgiveness due to the red tape inherent in the system,” says Anna Helhoski, NerdWallet’s student loan expert. For those unfamiliar, the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program forgives the remaining balance on direct loans after 120 qualifying monthly payments have been made under a qualifying repayment plan — but even the Department of Education itself notes that this program has had flaws: “The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program is an important — but largely unmet — promise to provide debt relief to support the teachers, nurses, firefighters, and others serving their communities through hard work that is essential to our country’s success,” it writes.",Business/MarketWatch,"‘This feels very unfair.’ I’m 73 and worked full-time in education.
