3/31/2022,"Jonas Eidevall has watched back the tapes and crunched the numbers. He reckons 1-1 in the first leg was a fair result. But crucially he also feels his side have room for improvement in the second, and in a Champions League quarter-final that may be decided on the finest of margins, that may just be enough. It is nine long years since Arsenal graced the semi-finals of the biggest club competition in women’s football. Lotte Wubben-Moy’s 89th-minute equaliser last week has made their task a good deal easier, particularly given the fact that away goals will not apply. But standing in their way are the green wall of Wolfsburg, a team in their own rhythm and winning groove, unbeaten in 14 competitive games and gracing Wolfsburg’s main VW Stadium for the first time since 2013. Most weeks, Wolfsburg’s women play at the smaller AOK-Stadion in front of crowds of a few thousand. But the decision to grant them the larger stage is a measure of the size of this game, with over 10,000 spectators expected in attendance. “This is why we play football,” midfielder Jill Roord observed earlier this week, and Wolfsburg will hope to continue the strong run of form that has carried them to the top of the Bundesliga as they attempt to regain their title from Bayern Munich. Rivals Hoffenheim and Eintracht Frankfurt have been handily dispatched in recent weeks, while Bayern themselves await in a title showdown on Sunday afternoon. Round these parts they call them “Englische Wochen” – two games in a week. And while Wolfsburg’s superior drilling and conditioning have carried them this far, there may just be cracks in the edifice that Arsenal – who enjoyed a weekend off after their game against Tottenham was postponed due to a Covid outbreak – can exploit. Wubben-Moy’s late goal exposed what is becoming something of an achilles heel for Wolfsburg in this season’s competition. It was the fourth time in seven games that they had conceded in the 89th minute or later, Chelsea and Juventus (twice) also having done so in the group stage. Patience, then, will be the buzzword for Arsenal here in the event of a tight game, safe in the knowledge that they can keep the pressure on right until the final moments. “It’ll definitely be a factor,” said Leah Williamson ahead of Thursday’s game. “We know we can fight back and can go into this game with a bit of freedom. If we can be patient and more clinical, hopefully we won’t have to wait until the 89th minute again.” Precision in the final third, meanwhile, was Eidevall’s main area for study from the first game in London. “In terms of scoring opportunities, 1-1 was a fair result,” he said. “But we should have created more situations from the positions that we got ourselves into. If we had been more skilled in 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 situations in the final third, I think we would have gotten way more out of the game. From a stats perspective, we were twice as often in the final third as they were, but we didn’t create as much from that. That’s somewhere we need to be more efficient.” And so the cutting edge of Stina Blackstenius may well be the deciding factor here, not just in punching holes but as a first line of defence in thwarting Wolfsburg’s quick counter-attacks. Above all you sense the balance between attack and defence will be key here, in a game where each team has the weapons to flay the other. “The margins are so small, but that’s why we love this stage of the tournament,” Eidevall said. “Everything is at stake.”",Sport/Football,Arsenal face tough task scaling Wolfsburg’s green wall in WCL,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/30/arsenal-face-tough-task-scaling-wolfsburgs-green-wall-in-wcl
3/31/2022,"Spoiler alert: this article is for people watching Moon Knight on Disney+. Do not read unless you have seen episode one. Another series about a former mercenary with dissociative identity disorder serving as the conduit for a justice-seeking Egyptian moon god? They really have run out of ideas over at Marvel, haven’t they? I jest, of course. After the hugely enjoyable but relatively straightforward escapades of Hawkeye last year comes Moon Knight, an altogether different animal, quite unlike anything we’ve seen so far from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Often reductively referred to as Marvel’s answer to Batman and among the more niche end of the comics, this opener had a lot of heavy lifting to do to establish the character and the world in which he lives. Interesting, then, that the first character we met was the big baddie – so often saved for late on in the season, as per WandaVision, The Falcon and the Winter Solider, Loki and Hawkeye. We got a glimpse of his powers later on in the Alpine town square, but quite why he was putting glass in his sandals will have to wait for another episode. Next, to our hero, Steven Grant, who clearly suffers from some sort of disruptive sleep disorder, to the point that he straps himself in to bed each night and puts tape over his doorframe so that he can tell in the morning if he was out sleepwalking. He works in the gift shop at the National Gallery, and when he arrived at work, I was less interested in the fact that his boss, Donna, bullies him and more concerned with how much that job must pay, given that he lives in a huge flat in an area of central London reminiscent of Covent Garden (it was actually Budapest, dressed up). I settled on the idea that he comes from money, or had some money squirrelled away from his mercenary days, and moved on. I especially enjoyed the scenes of Steven trying to escape Khonshu’s clutches in his apartment block, and the tonal switch from almost farcical comedy to genuine horror was impressive. The closing moments of the episode, with Steven alone in an empty museum save for a rampaging hell hound, were equally jumpy. Let’s take a moment to appreciate Oscar Isaac’s performance in this series opener. In what was almost a one-man show, the success of this first episode boiled down to whether you believe the professionally good-looking, charismatic A-lister as a slightly pathetic, friendless mess of a man. And I did, completely. I even stopped thinking about his ropey accent as the episode went on, although I had to laugh when Layla bellowed “What is with this accent?” down the phone, and I still can’t quite get Paul Rudd in Forgetting Sarah Marshall out of my head when I hear Steven talk. (Apparently Isaac based his accent on Ricky Gervais’s sidekick Karl Pilkington). It will be interesting to see if Isaac is equally as convincing as the more conventional hero-type Marc Spector. Bob Dylan’s Every Grain of Sand was playing over Arthur Harrow’s glass-in-the-sandals introduction, while Engelbert Humperdinck’s A Man Without Love welcomed Steven to the episode and was reprised as he woke from his “dream”. The lyrics of each song are perhaps a little on the nose – the former a William Blake-esque ode to faith and spirituality, the latter, with its line “Every day I wake up, then I start to break up” – but they quickly tell us a great deal about each character. I am willing to be corrected, but I couldn’t spot any glaring Easter eggs or references to the wider MCU. In fact, I couldn’t even place this in the timeline. Unremarkable for the first episode of a new character’s series, perhaps, but given MCU boss Kevin Feige’s comments about Moon Knight sticking around to cross over into other films and series, that will definitely change before the season is out. Tie-ins with Doctor Strange, given that it’s the next Marvel film on the slate, and Blade seem most likely. Wham!’s Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go was an inspired song choice during the Alpine car chase, at first seeming like an incongruous piece of music to be playing, taking on more meaning when the action cut to Steven waking from his apparent nightmare back in London. The list of missed calls on Marc’s phone featured just two names – Layla and Duchamp. Layla, we heard on the phone and have seen in the trailers. We will see whether right-hand man Duchamp will make an appearance. Budapest’s Museum of Fine Arts doubled for the National Gallery in London. F Murray Abraham, best known for his Oscar-winning performance as Antonio Salieri in 1984’s Amadeus, provides the voice inside Steven’s head. Abraham and Isaac appeared together in 2013’s Inside Llewyn Davis. What did you think? Did you enjoy Oscar Isaac’s performance? Have you forgiven the accent? Have your say below …",Arts/Television & radio,"Moon Knight recap: series one, episode one – virtually a one-man show for Oscar Isaac",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/30/moon-knight-recap-series-one-episode-one-virtually-a-one-man-show-for-oscar-isaac
3/31/2022,"Boris Johnson has repeatedly declined to admit rules were broken in Downing Street during lockdown, despite the Metropolitan police issuing 20 fixed-penalty notices, and Dominic Raab saying there were “clearly breaches of the regulations”. Raab, who as justice secretary oversees the legal system, suggested in a BBC interview on Wednesday that the Met’s decision to issue 20 penalty notices to people involved in Downing Street gatherings showed the law had been broken. But when the prime minister was later questioned by MPs on the backbench liaison committee, he repeatedly insisted he would not give a “running commentary”, adding: “I just think it would be wrong of me to deviate from that.” Pressed again by the SNP MP Pete Wishart, Johnson insisted: “I’m going to camp pretty firmly on my position.” “There will come a point when I will be able to talk about the investigation and the conclusions of the investigation, and that is when the investigation has concluded,” the prime minister added. Johnson also sought to suggest he had tackled some of the problems exposed in the report by the senior civil servant Sue Gray, by changing the leadership structure in No 10. “I have been several times to the house to talk about this and to explain and to apologise and to set out the things that we were doing to change the way things were run in No 10, and we’ve done that,” he said. Johnson declined to say whether it would be a resigning matter if he himself received a fixed-penalty notice. Downing Street has said it will announce if the prime minister receives such a notice, and if the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, does – but will not disclose which other officials have received them. Earlier, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, argued that Johnson had misled the House of Commons when he claimed in December, after stories of rule-breaking parties first appeared, that “all guidance was followed”. “He [Johnson] told the house no rules were broken in Downing Street during lockdown,” Starmer said. “The police have now concluded there was widespread criminality. The ministerial code says that ministers who knowingly mislead the house should resign. Why is he still here?” Johnson avoided the question, saying: “Of course, the investigators must get on with their job, but in the meantime, we are going to get on with our job.” Starmer replied by castigating Johnson for having repeatedly insisted he knew nothing about supposed Covid rule-breaking in Downing Street given the Metropolitan police have announced the fines, with others possibly to follow. “Look, there are only two possible explanations: either he’s trashing the ministerial code or he’s claiming he was repeatedly lied to by his own advisers and didn’t know what was going on in his own house and his own office,” Starmer said, asking: “When is he going to stop taking the British public for fools?” Starmer’s spokesperson later suggested Johnson’s claim that he could not comment while the police investigation was continuing, was “clearly untenable”. Labour has also suggested that Case, the most senior civil servant in No 10, should resign if he is issued with a fine. However, Conservative MPs appear to have accepted for now the argument that it would be premature to move against the prime minister when it remains unclear whether he will receive a fixed-penalty notice himself – and before Gray’s full report has been published. Several Tory MPs have previously said publicly they had sent letters to the 1922 Committee chair, Graham Brady, calling for a vote of no confidence in the prime minister, but some, including the Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross, have since withdrawn them. If 54 such letters were received, a vote of no confidence would be called, and if Johnson lost it, his premiership would be over. Despite the narrowing of the national polls since the war in Ukraine pushed Partygate down the news agenda, some backbenchers insist if the prime minister receives a fixed-penalty notice it should still be a resigning matter. The Met has not given any estimate of how long its investigations may take, and it has been suggested these first 20 notices are the easy cases, or “low-hanging fruit”. Scores of Conservative MPs joined Johnson for a dinner on Tuesday evening, aimed at burnishing his links with the parliamentary party. Starmer used the bulk of his questions at prime minister’s questions to tackle Johnson over the rising tax burden in the wake of last week’s spring statement, asking: “Does the prime minister still think that he and the chancellor are tax-cutting Conservatives?” “Yes, I certainly do,” Johnson replied, citing the cut in fuel duty in the statement, and the promise to cut income tax rates by 1p in 2024, saying this would mitigate the impact of the rise in national insurance to fund the NHS and social care. “Cut the nonsense and treat the British people with a bit of respect,” Starmer responded, adding, to laughs from Labour MPs: “I can only hope that his police questionnaire was a bit more convincing than that.”",News/Politics,Johnson refuses to admit lockdown rules were broken in Downing Street,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/30/johnson-refuses-to-admit-lockdown-rules-were-broken-in-downing-street
3/31/2022,"This was an extraordinary, historic night and it got a game to go with it. 91,553 people came to the Camp Nou, the biggest ever attendance for a women’s football match and if this is anything to go by, they will be back. In the semi-final, for a start. They haven’t had this much fun for a long time, maybe ever, ending the evening exhausted but elated. Goals from Mapi León, Aitana Bonmati, Claudia Pina, Alexia Putellas, and Caroline Graham Hansen saw Barcelona come from 2-1 down on the night to defeat Real Madrid 5-2 to win the clásico and reach the Champions League semi-finals. They had been tested but ultimately this Barcelona team is just too good, the finest side in Europe, and by a very long way, delivering a performance worthy of an occasion that will never be forgotten, played out on a stage and in front of an audience never seen before. “We’re going to try to repeat that what we did in the first game: be strong, aggressive,” the Real Madrid coach Alberto Toril said before kick-off. The task before them, though, remained huge and they were not really given the chance. Barcelona’s first shot came inside a minute, and they led within 10. Again, it was León, the central defender. Her long looping ball from the right curled inwards and bent goalwards, further than Misa Rodríguez had anticipated. Madrid’s goalkeeper tried to adjust but it was too high to reach, a roar greeting it as went over her and into the net. If there had been a hint of good fortune in that – the ball in looked more like a cross than a shot – it was in keeping with opening minutes, which soon became a giant rondo from the home team. Barcelona controlled possession, Aitana providing he neatest touches in the middle, Hansen progressing on the right, and Rolfo flying up the left, the wing all to herself, an extraordinary display of athleticism and precision delivery. From one cross, Hansen might have made it two, her rising shot just clearing the bar. It took Madrid 13 minutes to have a touch inside the Barcelona half, and that was a tackle from Olga Carmona. But football doesn’t always make sense and if that was the bad news for the visitors, the good news was that it was only another minute before they were level. Neat footwork from Maite Oroz found Carmona whose cross hit Irene Paredes, unable to withdraw her arm in time. From the spot, Carmona found the corner of the net. It was the first time Madrid had been in the area and it would be the last time too, the rondo re-established. The one time they escaped, space opening before them, Paredes flew across to make a tackle that took her opponent off her feet and put her supporters on theirs. Clear chances were few, but Barcelona’s control was total. Paredes, Hansen and Rolfo all had efforts, but still it was level. In terms of the score, anyway. That didn’t last long, but it wasn’t Barcelona who led; it was Madrid. Briefly, that is. Toril’s team had begun the half a little more on the front foot, insofar as two minutes was enough to make out any real pattern, but still this was unexpected. For Sandra Paños especially. Barca’s goalkeeper wasn’t that far off her line but from just six yards inside the half, Claudia Zornoza looked up, saw a gap and hit an absolutely sensational shot over her into the net. Game on, and what a game. Barcelona were back in the lead inside five minutes. Aitana soon levelled, receiving on the edge of the area, dropping a shoulder and neatly slotting a left-footed finish into the corner. The roar then was loud but what came next eclipsed even that. Clàudia Pina somehow controlled a ball that didn’t appear intended for her, put the brakes on and clipped over Misa and into the far corner, this place erupting into the kind of sound no one had heard all year, rhythm hammered out, palms stinging, throats raw. This was the party they had been promised and it wasn’t over yet. The Queen hadn’t arrived yet but she wasn’t far behind. Alexis Putellas, the world’s best player, the club captain and Ballon d’Or winner whose face looks out from the facade of this grand stadium, scored the fourth. The shot squeezed from Misa’s hands and just beyond the despairing dive of Ivana Andrés. Madrid looked broken, but at least it was by a team that is truly brilliant, Rolfo almost tearing into them again to set up Hansen for the fifth. A Mexican wave went round, just one thing left to see. And with three minutes to go there it was, the figure flashed up on the scoreboard, 91,533 fans greeting it with the biggest roar of a raucous night, their place in history secure.",Sport/Football,Mapi León sparks Barcelona Women’s Champions League rout of Real Madrid,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/30/barcelona-real-madrid-womens-champions-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report
3/31/2022,"Women in England will be able to access a “pills by post” abortion service indefinitely after MPs voted today to compel ministers to make it permanent instead of scrapping the scheme in September. The decision will benefit tens of thousands of women every year who want to take the two tablets needed to end a pregnancy in the privacy of their own home rather than having to take the first at a clinic or hospital. They have to be taken within the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. MPs took advantage of a free vote in the House of Commons on Wednesday afternoon to vote by 215 to 188 to force the government to abandon its plan to end the two-year trial of the scheme, which was brought in temporarily when Covid struck in spring 2020, on 29 August. Seventy-two Conservative MPs voted with Labour members and others to ensure that at-home early medical abortion will be maintained. Maria Miller, the former culture secretary, and Matt Warman were among Tory MPs to speak in favour. Labour MPs who did so included Diana Johnson and Jess Phillips, the shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding. Jubilant pro-choice campaigners hailed the vote as a major victory for abortion rights and women’s rights. “We are absolutely delighted that MPs followed the evidence and above all listened to women when they voted for the continuation of this service,” said Clare Murphy, the chief executive of BPAS, a major provider of abortion services. “Early abortion at home is safe, effective and an important option for women. We look forward to being able to provide this service into the future and are incredibly grateful to all the parliamentarians who championed it.” MPs voted on an amendment to the health and care bill, which was first proposed by Conservative peer Liz Sugg and passed by the House of Lords two weeks ago. It then became the subject of a government “motion to disagree” when it arrived in the Commons as ministers sought to avoid being bound by it. The vote will mean the landmark Abortion Act 1967 is amended and brings England into line with Wales, which recently decided to make the scheme permanent. Scotland is also planning to do the same as part of the new women’s health strategy of the Scottish nationalist administration at Holyrood. “This was a vote for evidence over ideology, a vote for reproductive rights and a vote for gender equality,” said Louise McCudden, the UK advocacy and public affairs adviser at MSI Reproductive Choices, a global provider of termination support, including 60,000 a year in England. “Making this safe and popular service a permanent option will particularly benefit those who struggle to attend face-to-face appointments, including those in abusive relationships, those with caring responsibilities, and those without transport. “Everyone chooses abortion for different reasons and under different circumstances. It is important that we can offer options that take into account personal circumstances – and that includes taking both pills at home.” Maggie Throup, the public health minister, sparked an outcry from medical groups, pro-choice organisations and abortion service providers when she announced last month that the two-year experiment with “pills by post” would be extended by six months and then axed altogether in England. About 150,000 women have used the at-home service since it began in 2020. Several medical royal colleges, including the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the British Medical Association criticised the plan to end the scheme as a betrayal of women’s rights because it would deny them the chance to choose where to take the pills. Anti-choice groups reacted with dismay to the vote. “This is a shameful day,” said Alithea Williams, the public policy manager at the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children. “It is disgusting that a healthcare bill has been hijacked to push through something that is not healthcare by any definition.”",News/World news,MPs vote to continue abortion ‘pills by post’ scheme in England,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/30/mps-vote-to-continue-abortion-pills-by-post-scheme-in-england
3/31/2022,"A female police worker has been jailed for having an affair with a convicted rapist she was supposed to be supervising. Rachel Beale, 53, was an offender manager within Wiltshire police’s management of sexual and violent offenders unit. The relationship she struck up with the male convicted rapist led her to be charged with misconduct in public office. On Wednesday, she was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment by Bristol crown court, having pleaded guilty to the offence in January. The case was investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). It said Beale, from Oxfordshire, also abused her position during Covid lockdown restrictions, making hotel bookings that were not anything to do with her work. Beale’s offending and misconduct took place between February and September 2020. She has already resigned from Wiltshire police and a disciplinary hearing concluded she would have been sacked if she had not. She has been banned from working in policing. Philip Wilkinson, the police and crime commissioner for Wiltshire, said: “Rachel Beale betrayed public trust when she began an inappropriate, intimate, relationship with a male offender she was responsible for supervising after his release from prison. “This will inevitably damage public confidence in policing and both the chief constable and I will eradicate any trace of corruption and misconduct within Wiltshire police. “We are both absolutely determined to ensure that public trust does not reach a place where it is irreparably broken.” IOPC regional director, Derrick Campbell, said: “Following our investigation, Rachel Beale admitted that she entered into an intimate relationship over a period of time with a man she was meant to be supervising professionally. “Despite knowing there was an imbalance of power she pursued the relationship. She also admitted misusing her police identification to book hotel rooms while Covid restrictions were in place and without policing purpose and treating him more favourably than others she was managing. “She abused her position and has now been sentenced by a criminal court for her actions, which carried significant potential to undermine public confidence in Wiltshire police. The public should be reassured that she can no longer hold a role in policing.” It follows several cases where officers have abused their position, with more expected in court. Beale’s case was unusual, with the crime being committed by a woman. Paul Mills, deputy chief constable of Wiltshire, added: “I want our communities across Swindon and Wiltshire to have the utmost confidence in their police force, and, although cases like this highlight the disappointing and unacceptable minority, I hope the public can see that we are committed to rooting out any kind of misconduct and taking the appropriate action.”",News/UK news,Ex-Wiltshire police worker jailed for affair with rapist she was supervising,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/30/ex-wiltshire-police-worker-jailed-for-affair-with-rapist-she-was-supervising
3/31/2022,"In the cold, dark basement of their bombed out apartment in Kharkiv, families huddle among the sewage pipes to keep warm. Two young girls, wearing thick coats and woolly hats, kneel in the dirt as they draw pictures of children beneath a bright yellow sun. The children’s family are among a number of Ukrainians worried that their lives are being put at risk by the UK’s complex and lengthy visa application process. On Wednesday, as Boris Johnson defended the government’s “overwhelmingly generous” record on refugees in the Commons, the Home Office revealed that just 2,700 visas have been issued under the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme. Meanwhile, shells were falling near a makeshift bomb shelter in Kharkiv where several families are waiting for the UK to rubberstamp their path to safety. “It’s constant bombing. Even in the blocks that are not bombed, there is no electricity. They have no water. There are no supplies. It is very scary for them,” said Tatyana Moskalenko, a Ukrainian who lives in the UK and is helping several families in Kharkiv navigate the UK visa process. “The majority of them have been spending weeks in a basement. They can’t get out of the house because it’s being constantly bombed.” Dozens of Ukrainian refugees have contacted the Guardian to describe the difficulties they are enduring as they wait for UK visas to be granted. Some have been forced to remain in areas being attacked by Russian forces, others are struggling to find safe places to stay in the countries that border Ukraine. In the UK thousands of potential hosts are increasingly worried by the delays. Some have expressed shame at having to explain to the refugees they are sponsoring that they will have to remain in a war zone until the visa is granted. Moskalenko and her friend Kate Larmer have matched 62 Ukrainian families – including 92 children – with more than 100 people willing to open up their homes in the Surrey market town of Farnham. Yet despite submitting about 80 visa applications under the UK’s Homes for Ukraine scheme, only one has been approved. “These difficulties are putting families’ lives at risk,” said Larmer. In Kyiv, university lecturer Maryna Rudina has her suitcase packed and waiting by the door of her flat, ready to leave as soon as visas are granted for her and her 14-year-old daughter Sofiia. She applied on 18 March and assumed the process would be swift. “It’s really terrifying here. There are sirens going off all the time, but it’s almost impossible to get to the shelter because we’re on the 24th floor. I’m checking my email every hour to see whether we’ve been sent the visas,” she said by telephone, adding that explosions had been audible just a few minutes earlier. “I feel my daughter’s life is in danger. We really need the visas to come very fast now.” Philippa Cameron, a garden designer from Altrincham, Manchester, who has offered to host her, said she felt embarrassed at the delays. “We have daily contact but cannot reassure them as no one knows how long the visa approval will take,” she said. Iryna Vasylchenko, a law graduate in the Kyiv suburb of Brovary, which came under heavy bombardment on Tuesday, said she had taken considerable risks just to fill in the UK application. The 39-year-old said: “To complete the visa, we have to leave the basement and risk our lives just to get somewhere with a connection. It took three days to complete. It’s a very, very laborious process.” Vasylchenko, who works as an administrator in a beauty salon, said she was terrified it would take weeks to be approved: “We live in very difficult conditions. There is no food, there is no money.” About 25,500 visas have been issued under the other government programme, the Ukraine Family scheme, since it was launched on 4 March, but relatives hoping to get family members to safety also said they were experiencing long delays. Nina Brown, who works for a hospice in Newport, said her 85-year-old mother, Nina Jolonko, had become so stressed after waiting three weeks for her UK visa to be granted, while staying in a school sports hall in Lublin in Poland, that she collapsed and had to be admitted to intensive care. “The visa has been granted now, but she is still in the cardiology section of intensive care, so I don’t know how we will get her to the UK. She is normally a happy, active person – someone who survived bombings during the second world war, starvation under Stalin, and survived bombings in Kharkiv this month, but it was the stress of waiting for the British visa which made her ill,” she said. “She has traveled to the UK four times previously – we couldn’t understand why she was made to wait so long for a new visa. At the refugee shelter, she witnessed buses arrive from France, Germany, Spain and Italy to pick up refugees. There was nothing from Britain; they just felt abandoned.” The Guardian has been told of numerous logistical and technical problems with the UK process. Filling in the forms can take three to four hours per person to complete – including for children – and must be submitted in English with all the correct documentation. Anyone without a Ukrainian international passport must apply for one or travel to a visa application centre in Poland, or further afield, to submit biometrics data. Lord Harrington, the refugees minister, said efforts were being made to streamline the system, and admitted that the process was “not as seamless as it should be”, but he was confident that 15,000 visas a week would soon be issued, and the backlog cleared. A government spokesperson said: “We continue to speed up visa processing across both schemes, with 25,500 visas issued in the last three weeks alone and thousands more expected to come through these uncapped routes.” Many of those who have fled Ukraine are rapidly running out of money. Some are giving up and returning to their wartorn homeland, despite the danger. Olha Hryhorchuk, 51, and her 78-year-old mother, Maria Haidychuk, decided to return to Ukraine days after applying in Rzeszów to travel to the UK. A farmer near Tunbridge Wells, Kent, has agreed to take them in under the Homes for Ukraine scheme but the two women could not afford to wait in Poland. “They didn’t know how long the visa application was going to take. It could take a hell of a long time,” said Derek Edwards, a British businessman who has spent two weeks on the Polish border helping Ukrainians find refuge in the UK. He drove Hryhorchuk and her mother back to the Ukrainian border. When they finally arrived in their hometown after a nine hour journey by bus, Hryhorchuk text him to say they had arrived safely but there was “no light in the city, only a traffic light and my mother and I under the wall [sheltering] completely alone. It was very cold, dark and scary.” Edwards, who runs a logistics firm, is helping another family who are contemplating trying to get back to Kharkiv rather than wait in Poland. He said: “The UK is being put to shame by the rest of Europe. This is simply inhumane.” Nataliia Gaidur, a former finance director from Kyiv, said she was effectively homeless in Warsaw with her 10-year-old son Illia, waiting for a UK visa to be granted so they can travel to their sponsor’s home near Huddersfield. They have slept in four different places in 11 days, and do not know where they will be sleeping tomorrow night. “We didn’t make a plan B because we were promised help in Britain; we thought it would take just three or four days to get a visa,” she said. “We don’t have any money, Ukrainian bank cards don’t work here, and the person we’re staying with here can only have us for another night. We’re starting to lose hope.”",News/World news,‘It’s terrifying here’: families are sick and scared in Ukraine as they wait for UK visas,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/30/its-terrifying-here-families-are-sick-and-scared-in-ukraine-as-they-wait-for-uk-visas
3/31/2022,"Donald Trump used an official White House phone to place at least one call during the Capitol attack on January 6 last year that should have been reflected in the internal presidential call log from that day but was not, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The former president called the phone of a Republican senator, Mike Lee, with a number recorded as 202-395-0000, a placeholder number that shows up when a call is incoming from a number of White House department phones, the sources said. The number corresponds to an official White House phone and the call was placed by Donald Trump himself, which means the call should have been recorded in the internal presidential call log that was turned over to the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack. Trump’s call to Lee was reported at the time, as well as its omission from the call log, by the Washington Post and CBS. But the origin of the call as coming from an official White House phone, which has not been previously reported, raises the prospect of tampering or deletion by Trump White House officials. It also appears to mark perhaps the most serious violation of the Presidential Record Act – the statute that mandates preservation of White House records pertaining to a president’s official duties – by the Trump White House concerning January 6 records to date. A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump called Lee at 2.26pm on January 6 through the official 202-395-0000 White House number, according to call detail records reviewed by the Guardian and confirmation by the two sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. The call was notable as Trump mistakenly dialed Lee thinking it was the number for Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville. Lee passed the phone to Tuberville, who told Trump Mike Pence had just been removed from the Senate chamber as rioters stormed the Capitol. But Trump’s call to Lee was not recorded in either the presidential daily diary or the presidential call log – a problem because even though entries in the daily diary are discretionary, according to several current and former White House officials, the call log is not. The presidential daily diary is a retrospective record of the president’s day produced by aides in the Oval Office, who have some sway to determine whether a particular event was significant enough to warrant its inclusion, the officials said. But the presidential call log, typically generated from data recorded when calls are placed by the White House operators, is supposed to be a comprehensive record of all incoming and outgoing calls involving the president through White House channels, the officials said. The fact that Trump’s call to Lee was routed through an official White House phone with a 202-395 prefix – either through a landline in the West Wing, the White House residence or a “work” cellphone – means details of that call should have been on the call log. The only instance where a call might not be reflected on the unclassified presidential call log, the officials said, would be if the call was classified, which would seem to be unlikely in the case of the call to Lee. The absence of Trump’s call to Lee suggests a serious breach in protocol and possible manipulation, the officials said. It was not immediately clear how a Trump White House official might obfuscate or tamper with the presidential call log, or who might have the authority to make such manipulations. Trump’s calls on January 6 might not have been recorded in the presidential call log if he used his personal phone or the cellphones of aides, the officials said, and Trump sometimes called people with the cellphone of his then White House deputy chief of staff, Dan Scavino. But multiple current and former White House officials have noted that a copy of the call log – alongside the president’s daily schedule and the presidential line-by-line document – might be provided to Oval Office operations to help compile the presidential daily diary. That could lead to a situation where records are vulnerable to tampering, since the presidential daily diary and call log needs approval by a senior White House official before they can be sent to the White House office of records management, the officials said. And by the time of January 6, two former Trump White House officials said, there was scope for political interference in records preservation, with no White House staff secretary formally appointed after Derek Lyons’ departure on 18 December. The White House Communications Agency has also not been immune to political influence, the select committee revealed last year, when it found evidence the agency produced a letter that was intended to be used to pressure states to decertify Joe Biden’s election win. Trump’s call to Lee was not the only call missing from an unexplained, seven-hour gap in the presidential call log that day. Trump, for instance, also connected with House minority leader Kevin McCarthy as the Capitol attack unfolded. The presidential daily diary and presidential call log were turned over to the select committee by the National Archives after the supreme court refused a last-ditch request from Trump to block the release of White House documents to the panel.",News/US news,Revealed: Trump used White House phone for call on January 6 that was not on official log,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/30/trump-used-white-house-phone-call-capitol-attack-jan-6-not-official-log
3/31/2022,"Russia’s announcement on Tuesday that it would “reduce military activity” around Kyiv and the nearby city of Chernihiv has been greeted with predictable scepticism, not least because shelling of both cities has continued. While some movement of troops from the north back to Belarus has been detected, these appear to be part of normal operational redeployments, and they do not yet definitively amount to a retreat. Ukraine’s general staff said overnight Russia was engaged in “probably a rotation of the separate units and aims at misleading”. If anything the shelling, with its consequences for civilians, is sadly to be expected: Russia will want to cover any halting of the ground offensive with firepower both to maintain uncertainty and keep Ukrainian forces tied down. And the capacity to bomb the city from a distance remains. Yet, it is obvious that Russia is, in the words of Konrad Muzyka, a military intelligence specialist and president of Rochan Consulting, “buying time” – as it seeks to refocus on the Donbas region and win a more conventional military victory in the east. The evident reality is that five weeks of near constant fighting north-west of the capital have utterly depleted Russia’s combat power. Across the board, Russian forces have suffered more than 10,000 casualties, the US now estimates – for a war that few of its troops expected or were properly prepared for. Moscow may also be concerned that the Russian invaders to the north-west of Kyiv could even become vulnerable to Ukrainian counterattacks – although while Irpin, 20km from Kyiv city centre, has been recaptured, it is not yet clear that the defenders have the military strength to roll the invaders rapidly back. Nevertheless, Ukrainian forces must press on where they can, to make it harder for Russia to retrench and regroup. On the one hand, the Russian statements also reflects a significant – but temporary – win for Ukraine. A siege of Kyiv, a nightmare scenario for hundreds of thousands, has been averted, by a spirited defence that has seen light infantry harass and destroy Russian armour that tried and failed to bear down on the capital. But Russia has a lot to gain from a slow down in fighting, particularly where it is accompanied by hopeful sounding rhetoric about reduced military activity around Kyiv – while its forces fight building by building for control of Mariupol in the south. Its forces can rest, reorganise, and quietly concentrate mass in the east, now the publicly stated focus of operations. Reinforcements, where they are available, are “mostly lined up for reinforcements in operations in the Donbas,” western intelligence officials said on Tuesday. They come from as far afield as Kaliningrad, the Russian enclave between Poland and Lithuania, and the country’s far east, and amount to about 10 battalion tactical groups, the smallest operating unit of the Russian army, each with about 800 personnel at full strength. For comparison Russia invaded with 115-120 such battalions, although up to 20 are now estimated to be no longer functional. Accompanying them, it is believed, are about 1,000 fighters from the Wagner Group, a shadowy Russian mercenary group, normally engaged in Kremlin-supported missions in Africa and the Middle East, but such is Moscow’s need for a military victory they have been brought into the fight closer to home. Phil Osborn, a former chief of UK defence intelligence, believes that while “both sides will benefit from a lessening of the operational tempo” the reality is that the Russians have the most to gain. “For this reduction not just to be a significant benefit to Russia, the west must maximise and quickly increase its support to Ukraine.” Ukraine has been asking for more powerful arms – including tanks, anti-aircraft and anti-artillery systems – for several days. But the question now is how far western leaders are ready to resupply Kyiv, particularly as there is now speculation that stocks of some high end weapons such as the anti-tank Javelins are running short. John Schaus, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a US thinktank, counted the US has sent 4,600 Javelins to Ukraine, which “accounts for more than half of the 8,885 Javelins the Department of Defense acquired in the past decade”. A discussion between Joe Biden, the US president, and fellow leaders in the UK, Germany, France and Italy, on Tuesday afternoon is said to have concluded that all five wanted to “increase our support for Ukraine,” according to one senior western official who listened in, a hint that more weapons would be sent, although when and what remains unclear. Russia may have started the war with its unprovoked invasion last month, but at the moment it is Ukraine that has the most to gain if its forces are able to disrupt Moscow’s efforts to regroup.",News/World news,Why is Russia’s military regrouping and can Ukraine forces disrupt them? ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/30/why-is-russias-military-regrouping-and-can-ukraine-forces-disrupt
3/31/2022,"Something of the ridiculousness of modern elite football could be found on the streets of central Vienna on Monday night as hundreds of the game’s power-brokers were escorted across the city to make sure they didn’t miss their dinner. Oliver Kahn was hugger-mugger with Michael Ballack, the Uefa president, Alexander Ceferin, was being pursued by the Leeds owner, Andrea Radrizzani, and Ajax’s Edwin van der Sar was trying to find out whether Roman Abramovich had been poisoned. They were part of a cohort that resembled a bunch of exchange students as they followed a big sign saying “ECA” to a grand restaurant where the food was later described as disappointing. The European Club Association is, depending on who you listen to, the secretive power broker at the heart of the continental game or a collaborative collective that seeks to make clubs’ voices heard amid the grinding bureaucracies of football’s governing bodies, Uefa in particular. This week they were holding their general congress in Sigmund Freud’s home town, a year on from apparently embracing their own death drive. From the heart of the ECA had come the idea of the European Super League, a prospect that sought to offer “significantly greater … support for European football” by placing its biggest clubs in a competition specifically closed to the rest. That idea never quite became reality and this year the ECA, according to its new leader, Paris Saint-Germain’s Nasser Al-Khelaifi, was able to declare the Super League “does not exist”. Legal proceedings in the European court of justice may suggest otherwise, but the point Khelaifi was really making was that he felt confident enough his organisation would not be split should such an idea return in the imminent future. A suggestion that was easy to believe here. Not only was the mood entirely convivial (something easier to achieve with the remaining ESL members, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus, having had their memberships revoked), but there was lots to celebrate. Thanks to the efforts of the club competitions committee working group, a body that feeds into Uefa’s executive committee and whose membership is not easy to identify, the ECA had agreed to a set of reforms for the Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League, that would mean more matches, more security and – everyone dearly hopes – more money for its 249 members. Among those reforms, which will begin in 2024, are the controversial plans to allow two clubs to enter the Champions League each year based in part on their historic performance. It is a decision that would have benefited Manchester United this year, for example, should they fail to make the Premier League top four. Then there is the prospect of 10 games for the 36 teams who qualify for the Champions League group stage, an idea that has so far resisted attempts by other parties – such as the Premier League – to take the number down to eight. Finally, there is the new joint venture that allows clubs to sit at the table with Uefa as they negotiate commercial deals for the three European club competitions, something Al-Khelaifi says has led to a 39% increase in forecasted revenues for the three years after 2024. So happy days then and a reminder the situation the Super League clubs were desperate to escape was pretty cushy. At the same time, however, the ECA also agreed to new financial control regulations that were tougher than had been expected. Clubs who compete in Europe will have to commit to spending no more than 70% of their income on transfers, wages and agents fees. They will also have to agree to pay money owed on transfers and other payments on time and if they don’t they will be fined European points or even banned from competition altogether. The mood suggested all these measures had been accepted by the ECA’s 249 members, with barely a note of dissent. The big clubs will continue to get richer, but other clubs see opportunities too. Aki Riihilahti is a vice-chair of the ECA and the former Crystal Palace midfielder is chief executive of his home town club, HJK Helsinki. He points to an increase of £40m each season in solidarity from clubs in the top five European Leagues to those outside as a sign of a more cooperative direction. He says the increase in group stage matches, plus the introduction of the Europa Conference League, is strengthening the competitive environment for smaller nations, and helping to develop their players. He also admits to being in the CCC working group. “I was there and we talked more about football than ever before. From a broader perspective we are united in what we want. There will be more countries represented in the group stages, which is amazing because that is something that gives a lot of countries relevance and keeps them alive from a professional football perspective. “We have five domestic leagues where the TV money is so huge, and that is the reason for the competitive imbalance, but you can use Uefa competitions to give the other 50 at least part of it. That’s why the discussions have really been fantastic: it has given us a view going forward that there is room for all countries.” He acknowledges that challenges remain, not least keeping local clubs alive while the global televised game continues to grow. “It’s good when there’s the local and the global. So you can support two teams, that’s fine, but if you only have the global brand I don’t think football will have the same fanbase, you don’t have the same initial attachment, it will be only entertainment. “But I think people understand that and, as a champion of a smaller country, I really must welcome the discussions and initiatives we have had with Uefa. It’s so much more fair than it’s ever been before. We have to give Uefa and ECA credit for that.”",Sport/Football,ECA helps clubs flex their muscles and increase their influence,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/30/eca-helps-clubs-flex-their-muscles-and-increase-their-influence
3/31/2022,"Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy could meet “soon”, a senior aide to Ukraine’s president has claimed, even as the Kremlin downplayed hopes of an early breakthrough in the peace talks. The head of Ukraine’s negotiating team, Mykhailo Podolyak, a key adviser to Zelenskiy, said on Wednesday that Moscow was scrutinising proposals submitted by Kyiv in Istanbul which he believed could lead to a presidential peace summit. “We can expect a presidential meeting to be held some time soon,” Podolyak said. “When is too early to tell, but it is a logistical issue.” Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said it was “positive” that Ukraine had set out its position, but he talked down expectations of a summit. “We cannot state that there was anything too promising or any breakthroughs,” he said, adding that there was “a lot of work to be done”. Later on Wednesday, Vladimir Medinsky, the head of Russia’s delegation in the talks this week, once again raised hopes, however, by claiming that Zelenskiy’s proposals indicated a readiness by Ukraine to reach a deal “for the first time in years”, adding that “if it fulfils the obligations, the threat of creating a Nato bridgehead on the Ukrainian territory will be removed”. The claims and counter-claims from the two capitals highlight the negotiating games being played by both sides as the war continues to rage in hotspots across Ukraine, with little sign of the bloodshed abating. The United Nations refugee agency said on Wednesday that more than 4 million people had fled Russia’s “utterly senseless” war . According to the UN body, 4,019,287 people have fled abroad since the start of Russia’s invasion on 24 February, exceeding its initial estimate that the war would create up to 4 million refugees. More than 90% are women and children. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said on Twitter he had just arrived in Ukraine and was beginning discussions with authorities, the UN and other partners on “ways to increase our support to people affected and displaced by this senseless war”. The agency has said the speed and scale of the displacement is unprecedented in Europe since the second world war. The UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM) also said that as of mid-March, 6.48 million people were internally displaced. “They need urgent, life-saving aid,” the IOM said on Wednesday. Before the war, Ukraine had a population of 37 million in the regions under government control, excluding Crimea and the Russian-controlled regions in the east. At the talks in Istanbul on Tuesday, Ukraine proposed a framework for peace under which it would remain neutral, with its security guaranteed by third-party countries through a treaty similar to Nato’s article 5 mutual defence commitment. The proposals, intended to come into force only in the event of a complete ceasefire, included a 15-year consultation period on the status of the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow seized from Ukraine and annexed in 2014. Medinsky said Ukraine had appeared ready to commit to a nuclear-free status and drop its aspirations, contained within the country’s constitution, to join the Nato military alliance. He said Ukraine had also signalled that it could agree not to host foreign military bases and that it would only hold joint drills with foreign militaries in consultation with countries serving as guarantors of a peace deal, including the five permanent UN security council members, of which Russia is one. Podolyak said any deal would need to be put to a referendum, which could only happen once Russian troops had withdrawn but, in what appeared to be a further concession, he added that this could be only to “the positions as of 23 February 2022”, in an apparent recognition that soldiers will remain at least in Crimea. Key to Kyiv is that the four other security council members – the US, UK, France and China – commit to intervening should there be any future invasion of Ukrainian territory – which he claimed Moscow had accepted. Podolyak, who said the Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich had been playing an effective role as a moderator of the talks, said: “We have submitted our suggestions to the Russian party saying that in principle this is time for the presidential-level meeting. When that is going to happen is rather a logistical question. “The Russians need to go over our suggestions and give some preliminary response. Now we are working at the working group level online, clarifying different points so that package of documents is ready.” He added: “We came to Istanbul to define the intermediate positions in the key documents. In our group as we see it, in the Ukrainian negotiating team, we see a possibility to sign preliminary agreements and to launch the presidential meeting process so, perhaps, in two or three or four days we will have a final version that will be confirmed by the Russians with amendments and then we can reach the next round of negotiations.” Moscow described the talks as “meaningful” and “constructive” and subsequently pledged to “radically reduce” its military activity around Kyiv and Chernihiv, a heavily shelled city 100 miles north of the capital, as a goodwill gesture to “to increase mutual trust” in the peace negotiations. Col Oleksandr Motyuzyanyk, spokesperson for the Ukrainian ministry of defence, said they had seen “some partial movement of certain units of the enemy from Kyiv and Chernihiv areas”. “At the same time there is no mass-scale withdrawal from those areas,” he said. “The enemy has been withdrawing units which suffered the highest losses in order to replenish them. As far as we see the enemy has not abandoned its attempts to take or at least siege the capital city and Chernihiv.” Western analysts and diplomats noted that Russia’s offer to partially pull back came after its advance, thwarted by stiff resistance and supply problems, had all but stalled, and that Moscow had already said it was refocusing its military goals on expanding the territory held by pro-Russia separatists in the eastern Donbas regions. Officials in both Kyiv and Chernihiv said that both cities were still facing heavy shelling.",News/World news,"Putin and Zelenskiy could meet soon, says Ukraine’s top negotiator",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/30/putin-and-zelenskiy-could-meet-soon-says-ukraines-top-negotiator
