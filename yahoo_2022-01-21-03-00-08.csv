1/21/2022,"A 7-year-old Florida girl has reported being bullied at school, saying her perpetrator was not another student but her teacher. Her mother has hired a lawyer and plans to sue the school district after hearing about the teacher’s alleged abuse and spotting bruises, believed to be from the incident, on her daughter’s body. The teacher, a white woman whose name has been redacted from the police report obtained by the Miami New Times, has served the Miami-Dade County Public Schools (MDCPS) for over 45 years. On Sept. 29, 2021, Amaria Clark, a former student at the Airbase K-8 Center School in Homestead, Florida told her mother that her teacher impeded her from getting on the school bus by gripping her wrist so forcefully that it left a mark. Witnesses, including Clark’s older brother, saw the teacher pull the little Black girl down the bus steps and publicly accuse her of stealing a cellphone. Adah Clark, the victim’s mother, says she was made aware of the incident after the children came home. She said, “When my child gets off the bus, other children were all around me, telling me what happened. It didn’t make sense, but by the time I got to Amaria, her arms told it all.” The mother took the girl to the Nicklaus Children’s Hospital’s urgent-care unit and reported the assault to the Miami-Dade County Police Department (MDPD). In their report, the police write that they observed red bruises on the child’s hands and wrists also. “Once the doctor came back and had to wrap her little wrist, I just broke,” the mother added. “She went from doing cartwheels up and down to now having to rest her hand on a pillow because it hurt.” The family claims that Amaria suffered a sprained arm as a result of this assault and is now in a sling. According to CBS 4, the family plans to file a federal lawsuit. Clark told a reporter, “I sent her to school, the way I send her to school is the way I expect her to come back.” Clark described her adopted daughter as “loving,” “sweet,” and “kind.” She further noted that the girl, who is also developmentally delayed, is not “an evil child” or “vicious child.” Lawyers representing the family say that the teacher’s actions were in retaliation for telling school officials that she was mistreated in the class. The Miami New Times reports that Amaria has an Individual Education Plan (IEP) for students who learn differently and need different tools to be successful in the classroom. The mother claims that the teacher would not allow the second-grader to go to the bathroom— because she believed the girl was lying. The teacher did not regard Amaria’s medical records that state her being under the care of a urologist for four years about issues concerning her bladder. The administration removed the girl from the classroom, transferring her to a different teacher shortly before the incident. Lawyers contend this is motive for why she grabbed the girl from the bus and accused her of stealing. Now, the child is even more scared of the teacher. Attorney Rawsi Williams says no child should be afraid that their teacher should retaliate. “No child should have to go to school worried about what will happen to them in regard to teachers and administrators,” Williams remarked. Williams also alleges in the lawsuit, filed on behalf of the family, Amaria’s 14th Amendment Due Process and Equal Protection Claims have been violated. The teacher’s actions were also a “violation of the American With Disabilities Act, assault & battery, false imprisonment, displayed negligence, and infliction of emotional and physical distress on the child.” The school district released a statement saying the teacher did nothing wrong, “These are serious allegations that were thoroughly investigated as soon as they were first reported. The investigation was concluded with a finding of no probable cause.” Another attorney for the family, Frank Allen, says that no investigation has cleared the teacher. “There was no clearing,” Allen rebutted. “Once we get a chance to depose officials at the school, the teacher, and some of these students, then we’ll see if she’s cleared.” The mother has transferred her daughter to a different school and plans to sue the teacher, assistant principal, principal, and anyone else responsible for the trauma her daughter experienced at the school.

1/21/2022,"White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki marked the one-year anniversary of President Joe Biden’s inauguration on Thursday by walking into the lion’s den. For the first time in her role as Biden’s top flack, she appeared on a Fox News weekday show. Those expecting a knock-down, drag-out fight between the spokesperson and Fox anchors, however, would have been left largely disappointed. In the end, the 13-minute interview was a mostly friendly affair that ended with light questioning and well-wishes for Psaki’s favorite NFL team. Co-anchors Bill Hemmer and Dana Perino kicked off the lengthy chat on Thursday morning with some friendly banter, noting that both Psaki and Hemmer are fans of the Cincinnati Bengals, currently competing in the playoffs. “Hopefully no breaking news you have to deal with during the Bengals game. We will try to protect you from that,” Perino cheekily noted, prompting chuckles all around. From there, the two America’s Newsroom hosts launched into some of the biggest points of contention that arose from Biden’s marathon Wednesday afternoon press conference. Namely, the president’s suggestion that upcoming elections may not be legitimate if voting rights legislation isn’t passed, and Biden seemingly indicating that America would be fine with a Russian “minor incursion” with Ukraine. Noting that Democrats’ voting bill failed in the Senate, Perino wondered if the White House would “continue to say” that future elections will be illegitimate. Psaki, having already attempted to clean up Biden’s remarks via Twitter earlier in the day, stuck to those same talking points. “First, I talked to the president a lot about this and he is not predicting that the 2022 elections would be illegitimate,” she declared. “The point he was raising was both, that in 2020, even amongst challenging circumstances efforts to suppress the vote in the midst of a pandemic, there was record turnout. Democrats and Republicans—record turnout to go to the polls. The point he was making was that the former president asked seven or more states to overturn the outcome of the election. Now obviously, if there is an effort to do that, we have to fight against it.” Throughout the conversation, Psaki appeared cheerful and congenial, regardless of how pointed her hosts’ questions became. She also leaned on shared interests and commonalities in an effort to disarm her interviewers. For example, after Perino asked her if there was an “off-ramp” for unvaccinated Americans now that some European countries are easing vaccine mandates and restrictions as the Omicron surge dissipates, the press secretary invoked Hemmer’s Bengals fandom. “At the same time, Dana you make a really important point. We don’t want to live like this. You heard the president say we don’t want to live like this forever,” she stated. “We want to get back to a point where we aren’t wearing masks, of course. Where we’re not worried about our kids being in school and where we can go on and cheer for the Bengals. That one’s for you, Bill.” Psaki did dish out a little snark—at least when it came to one of Hemmer’s questions. After the veteran newsman noted that the issue of immigration and border security never came up during the Biden presser, Hemmer asked Psaki if we should expect another record year of border encounters in 2022. “Well, I’m surprised Bill, as well,” a smiling Psaki retorted. “It was a nearly two-hour press conference and people asked whatever they wanted, including crazy questions in there.” The press secretary was referencing the topics reporters from right-wing outlets—including Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy—decided to ask the president about on Wednesday. Doocy, for example, asked Biden why he’s “trying so hard” to “pull the country so far to the left.” James Rosen, a disgraced former Fox News reporter now with rival network Newsmax, used his time to press Biden on his “cognitive fitness.” Even on the topic of Russia and Biden’s comments, which have created an international headache, Psaki held firm to her script. Even after Hemmer read aloud a just-posted tweet by the Ukrainian president taking a jab at Biden for appearing to shrug off a “minor incursion” by Russia. “Thank you for the opportunity,” she responded. “I want to be very clear. The president has conveyed directly to President Putin that if there is a movement of any military troops across the border, that is an invasion. If they go in, that is an invasion and there will be severe economic consequences. I know the president of Ukraine knows that and we’ve conveyed it.” Towards the end, the interview came full circle as the anchors once again engaged in light-hearted repartee with the Biden flack. Perino, a former White House spokesperson herself, expressed an air of comradery with Psaki, specifically over a president deciding on the fly to extend a press conference. (The ex-Bush administration official has commended Psaki in the past.) “When the president said—looks at his watch and says, ‘I guess I’ll go another 24 minutes,’ I’m curious what your exact heart rate was at that point?” Perino quipped. “I’m a pretty chill person in general. I may not always seem that way in the briefing room but I will say I knew – I watched and knew he was having a good time,” a beaming Psaki answered. “I was having a heart attack for you,” Perino jokingly added.

1/21/2022,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain has sent warships to join NATO naval forces in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea as tension in the region rises over the Russian military build-up on the Ukrainian border, Defence Minister Margarita Robles said on Thursday. A mine-sweeper is already en route and a frigate will sail within three or four days, Robles told reporters. The Madrid government is also considering sending fighter jets to Bulgaria, she said. ""Russia cannot tell any country what to do, so NATO will protect and defend the sovereignty of any country that can or wants to join NATO,"" she said. Spain's preference was for an ""exclusively diplomatic response"" to resolving the conflict, she added. The Spanish contribution to the NATO military deployment in eastern Europe comes after Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed a coordinated response to the threat to Ukraine from Russia at a meeting in Washington on Tuesday. Russia has massed tens of thousands of troops on its borders with Ukraine and Western states fear Moscow is planning a new assault on a country it invaded in 2014. The Kremlin denies it is planning an attack but says it could take unspecified military action if a list of demands are not met, including a promise from NATO never to admit Ukraine as a member. Western officials, diplomats and former officials told Reuters this week https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-russia-nato/analysis-russian-troop-build-up-sparks-unintended-nato-renewal-idUSKBN2JU11A that NATO - created in 1949 to deter the Soviet threat - was obliged to consider reinforcements that go against Putin's demand that the alliance must not expand further eastwards. Denmark said it was sending a frigate to the Baltic Sea this week and French President Emmanuel Macron has offered to send troops to Romania. Further troop decisions could be made as early as a NATO summit in Madrid in June, diplomats and officials said.
