1/25/2022,"My friend Chris Walker, who has died of pneumonia aged 66, worked as a GP in Sheffield for more than 30 years, first at the radical practice in Darnall, then at Park medical centre until his retirement in 2014. He developed a special interest in working in the fields of drug rehabilitation and migraine. Chris was born in Epsom, Surrey, the second of four children of Emma (nee Lewis), a nurse, and Derek Walker, a psychiatrist. The family moved to Painswick, Gloucestershire, and Chris went to Wycliffe college, then on to study medicine at Sheffield University. After graduating he travelled with friends overland to Africa in a self-assembled Unimog vehicle that resembled a mini-tank.  While a trainee GP, Chris met my friend, Rachel Strong, a ward sister at Middlewood hospital. We all moved into the “Red House” (with a red door and socialist housemates) in Hunter’s Bar, Sheffield, in 1984; four adults – me and my partner, Ted, Chris and Rachel – soon to be joined by our five children, plus a dog, Henry Blenkinsop. Late night discussions, red wine and home brew kept our many visitors entertained. Chris made argument into an art form and was the ultimate host and cook. After five years, exhausted by the Red House party lifestyle, we went our separate ways but remained firm friends. Chris had begun working in 1986 at the Darnall practice, which operated on socialist principles – all staff, whether GPs, nurses, cleaners or clerical workers, got the same hourly rate. Later, Chris and his family settled in the Sheffield suburb of Meersbrook, and he joined Park medical centre. They ran an open house for neighbours and friends; his BBQs and bonfires were famous. He loved his allotment and DIY, and his drill or trowel were often a table centre-piece at dinner parties. With characteristic generosity, Chris and Rachel recently lent their home to be used in a local independent film, Mr Wong’s Lullaby, 2021. Chris’s Pembrokeshire roots through his mother’s family were important. He loved the family cottage close to his maternal grandparents in Ambleston and enjoyed sharing this beautiful place with friends. Concussion after a cycling accident in France in 2009 started a decline in Chris’s health. Epilepsy and recurrent bouts of pneumonia over recent years had left him fragile but he was still a determined spirit. For all his maverick individualism he was a loving, loyal man who held his family close to his heart. His friends will remember Chris as a daredevil, giggling on his homemade zipwire, whizzing over a bonfire, a glass of red wine in one hand and a machete in the other. Chris is survived by Rachel, whom he married in 2004, their son, Jim, and daughter, Emma, three grandchildren, Toby, Rowan and Fern, and his siblings, John, Helen and Charlotte.",News/UK news,Chris Walker obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/24/chris-walker-obituary
1/25/2022,"Ever since Hannah Horvath, the unfocused twentysomething protagonist of the HBO series Girls, declared herself the voice of a generation, audiences have struggled to read Lena Dunham. The line was clearly at least half-ironic, a joke, but many took it at face value, indicative of Dunham’s aspirations as both a writer and public figure. Dunham has provoked, fairly and unfairly, intense reactions since Girls, which she created with Jenni Konner, put her on the map in 2012, at 25; her solid artistic instincts – go back and watch the pre-MeToo sixth season episode American Bitch, which shreds the double-edged flattery of the self-important male artist – are often accompanied by baffling foot-in-mouth moments along lines of race, class, gender, and plain old overexposure.  Sharp Stick, Dunham’s first film since her breakout feature Tiny Furniture in 2011, isn’t likely to help that reputation. This awkward, misjudged, occasionally sexy film has seeds of a radical, fresh story and flashes of directorial brilliance but is hobbled throughout by the confounding decision to write her 26-year-old main character as either insensitively neuro-divergent or more sheltered child than adult. That character is Sarah Jo (Kristine Froseth), an outsider who lives on the margins of Hollywood with her mother Marilyn (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a sun-dried, tipsy Hollywood burnout turned apartment manager, and her adopted sister Treina (Taylour Paige), who posts gyrating dance videos online. Sarah Jo is a wallflower, a lurker, coded from the start as weird: she listens, wide-eyed, to her mother and sister’s frank bickering about sex and desire, seems perplexed by Treina’s performance of sexiness online, dresses in the long skirts and blouses of a schoolmarm with the barrettes of a student. Froseth plays Sarah Jo as an uncomfortable waif – she walks stiffly, balls her fists. While everyone else eats quietly, she bizarrely smacks her lips with yogurt. Like Dunham, who has spoken publicly about undergoing a hysterectomy in 2018, Sarah Jo is without her uterus; it was removed in an emergency surgery at 17, plunging her into early menopause and cauterizing her sexual development. At 26, she’s still a virgin and is somehow, despite growing up in her liberated household and with access to the internet, so unschooled in the carnal that it’s laughable (we’re talking blowing air on a penis as a “blowjob”). Sarah Jo’s naivety more than strains credulity; what doesn’t is her attraction to Josh (Jon Bernthal), the father of Zach (Liam Michel Saux), a child with Down syndrome for whom Sarah Jo is a caretaker. Where Sarah Jo is repressed, jumpy, child-like, Josh is assured, disarming, older. He’s also married to Dunham’s Heather, heavily pregnant with their second child and nerves frayed. Determined to lose her virginity to someone she cares about, Sarah Jo propositions Josh with all the guile of an adolescent; that Josh takes the bait is, in retrospect, shocking, made convincing only by Bernthal’s embodied, winning performance. The subsequent affair, by far the film’s most sumptuous, stirring and evocative section (Dunham has a knack for filming sex scenes that are both grounded and transportive; Froseth believably portrays an orgasm several times), unleashes a feral desire in Sarah Jo that obliterates her former trepidation. The 86-minute film’s second half finds Sarah Jo pining after her newly discovered favorite porn star (Scott Speedman) and approaching sexual experience like a science project, using men from apps to check off one act at a time. All of this could be interesting, immersive material, especially given Dunham’s ability to capture female pleasure in realistic depictions of sex. It’s disappointing then that several intriguing premises – an inexperienced late twentysomething who feels underdeveloped, a sexual coming-of-age without the possibility of children and after menopause, even the more traversed lane of a younger woman entranced into an affair with an older, married man (and her boss, no less) – are torpedoed by Dunham’s decision, refracted by Froseth’s odd performance, to write Sarah Jo as more sexual alien than curious person. A charitable read is that Dunham was so determined to cast her protagonist as marked, separate, different that she overshot, writing a one-dimensionally unaware character with the carnal knowledge and mannerisms of a child. A less charitable interpretation, as suggested by the autism sexuality advocate Amy Gravino in a Twitter thread (Gravino said she was invited, then disinvited, to consult on the script), is that the character was written as neurodivergent/autistic without thinking through the sensitivity of, say, Sarah Jo’s unfamiliarity with the concept of oral sex. Either way, it’s dissatisfying and confusing; there’s a way to write a 26-year-old character who feels cleaved from her age, both too young and too old at once, without infantilizing her. Perhaps the most frustrating part of watching Sharp Stick is seeing more promising, expansive storylines side-swipe this blundering one – Treina’s heartbreak, for instance, or the aftermath of the Josh affair on Zach and Heather (Dunham remains a charismatic and natural performer who I genuinely wish I saw on screen more), even a single one of Sarah Jo’s hookups in isolation. I would’ve watched any of these movies, because Sharp Stick does affirm my trust in Dunham’s visual instincts, especially with intimate scenes. Unfortunately, it does little to reassure on her narrative ones.

1/25/2022,"The mood in Kyiv was calm on Monday, with shops and cafes busy and few visible signs of panic, despite the decision by the US and UK embassies to evacuate all non-essential staff amid warnings of a Russian attack. In the capital’s upmarket Podil district, families strolled amid festive lights and skated on an open-air ice rink. There were long queues at the October cinema for a screening of Stop-Zemlia, a prize-winning Ukrainian film about the lives of Kyiv teenagers.  “I don’t think anything is going to happen,” said Sasha, a hairdresser from the eastern city of Kharkiv at a trendy barber shop that was open for business as usual. “There’s no way the Russians could take my home city. We would fight.” Others said they were making tentative plans about what to do in the event of invasion, while carrying on as before. Maria Glazunova, a communications manager at Ukraine’s national film archive, said she discussed the topic on Sunday over coffee with her mother. “My mum said: ‘I’m not interested in politics. What would Putin want with me?’ That’s one view,” she said. “People who read the news on the internet are not so calm, but life goes on. We think about war but we have to work and we need fun as well.” Glazunova said her director had written to Ukraine’s culture ministry, seeking advice on what to do with the archive in the event of Russian bombardment. The ministry had yet to reply, she said. In the meantime, she was working from home as usual. A woman who declined to be named said she had tried to persuade her parents to take a holiday in Truskavets, an old-fashioned spa town in the west of the country near the city of Lviv. “My mother refused to go. She told me she wants to die in Kyiv,” the woman explained. On Monday, US citizens living in Ukraine received emails urging them to leave, or – if they elect to stay – to register with the embassy. It said: “There are reports Russia is planning significant military action in Ukraine. “The security conditions, particularly along Ukraine’s borders, in Russian-occupied Crimea and in Russian-controlled eastern Ukraine, are unpredictable and can deteriorate with little notice. Demonstrations, which have turned violent at times, regularly occur throughout Ukraine, including in Kyiv.” An attack would “severely impact” the embassy’s ability to help Americans leave, it said. Ukraine’s government, by contrast, has urged citizens not to panic. On Monday the foreign ministry expressed irritation with the UK and US decision to draw down their embassies in Kyiv. The move was “premature and overly cautious”, the spokesperson Oleh Nikolenko told Interfax Ukraine. Nikolenko said there had been no radical changes in the security situation. He noted that the buildup of Russian forces on Ukraine’s borders began in April last year. In an address last week, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy tried to project an air of normality. He said the invasion had started back in 2014, when Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea and kickstarted a violent separatist uprising in the Donbas region in the east. “Did the threat of war appear only now? These risks have existed for more than a year. They haven’t become bigger,” Zelenskiy said. He suggested that the Kremlin was deliberating creating a “stir” in order to undermine the nation’s morale. “They are actively attacking our land and your nerves,” he said in a video. Despite these official reassurances, the mood in Kyiv has darkened in recent days. One well-connected former official said his military contacts were insouciant two weeks ago about the prospect of Russian invasion, dismissing it as little more than a fictitious TV scenario. Recently, however, the same government people had been quietly filling up their cars with petrol and stocking up on food supplies, he said. What was his plan? “Many people have legal weapons and will fight. My wife lives in Brussels and I will go and join her there,” he said.

1/25/2022,"Three years ago reporter Lourdes Maldonado López stood up before Mexico’s president at a press conference and told him: “I fear for my life.” On Sunday she was gunned down in the city of Tijuana – the third Mexican journalist to be killed this year in what is a deepening murder crisis facing the country’s press corps and its populist leader, Andrés Manuel López Obrador.  Maldonado, a former journalist for Mexico’s biggest network, Televisa, was reportedly shot in her car outside her home at about 6.20pm. “This cannot be happening. Fuck!” tweeted Manuel Ayala, another member of Tijuana’s tight-knit journalism community, as news of the shooting spread. Maldonado’s killing came less than a week after the murder of another veteran local journalist, the photographer and crime reporter Margarito Martínez. Martínez, 49, was shot dead last Monday – also outside his Tijuana home – for reasons that remain murky. Days earlier another journalist, José Luis Gamboa, was fatally stabbed in Veracruz state. Activists say nine Mexican journalists were murdered last year and more than 50 have been killed since López Obrador took office in 2018. The trio of murders have stunned Mexico’s beleaguered press corps – particularly in Tijuana, the scene of two of the crimes. On Friday friends and relatives buried Martínez in the Mexican border city before holding a public protest. “The hardest thing was covering the crime scene of a murdered friend. I never thought this would happen,” photographer Omar Martínez told the local news group Cadena Noticias. Maldonado, whose shooting is still being investigated, made headlines in March 2019 when she publicly spoke out over a long-running dispute she was having with a former employer – a media outlet owned by a powerful regional politician and media boss called Jaime Bonilla Valdez – which she accused of wrongful dismissal. At one of López Obrador’s regular “mañanera” press conferences, Maldonado asked for his help resolving the situation with Bonilla, who is a member of the president’s political party, and said she feared for her life. López Obrador, who is best known as Amlo, asked one of his communications chiefs to look into the accusation and offer support. Last week it was reported that the media outlet had been ordered to pay Maldonado restitution. There is no suggestion of a link between the work dispute and her killing, but the fact that she had publicly voiced concern over her safety – and subsequently was murdered – drew widespread attention after Sunday’s attack. The media freedom group Article 19 said Maldonado had been included in a protection scheme for journalists as a result of threats she had received while covering issues such as politics and corruption. Addressing reporters on Monday morning, López Obrador recalled the journalist’s 2019 plea but claimed it had not been “a matter of threats or violence”. “What has to happen in Mexico for journalists to be able to operate safely and freely?” one reporter asked Amlo, whom activists accuse of doing little to halt violence against the press. Mexico’s president called for “a fairer and more humanitarian society” but sought to shift blame for the bloodshed onto the “rotten” neo-liberal legacy, which he said meant he had inherited a “profound social, economic and moral crisis”. “We are coming out of this period of decay and violence,” Amlo insisted. “Corruption, inequality and violence – this is what they left us.”",News/World news,Third Mexican journalist killed this year as press corps faces murder crisis ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/mexico-third-journalist-killed-this-year
1/25/2022,"While the fairytale story of Comoros’s journey to the knockout stages of this year’s Africa Cup of Nations will some day make an inspirational feel-good movie, one suspects Disney’s scriptwriters will have to leave out some of the finer details on the grounds that audiences may find them just a little bit too far-fetched.  Hailing from a financially impoverished archipelago with a population of less than one million people located off the east coast of the continent, Les Coelacantes pulled off something of a miracle in merely qualifying for Afcon but certainly weren’t expected to make it this far. Two defeats in their opening group games with a match against Ghana to come meant a predictably early exit was assured, until the plucky journeymen of Comoros went all supernova on the Black Stars, beating them 3-2 in one of the greatest upsets in African football history. After several days of what must have seemed an interminable wait, Amir Abdou and his players learned they had not only done enough to book a spot in the last 16, but would be pitted against their hosts Cameroon. A nation many millions outside the continent had never heard of as recently as a fortnight ago suddenly became many people’s favourite African team. So far, so Cool Runnings or Mighty Ducks … but then things started to get a little implausible. Over the weekend it was revealed that Comoros would be forced to play one of their outfield players in goal against Cameroon tonight after first choice in net, Salim Ben Boina, was injured and his understudies Ali Ahamada and Moyadh Ousseini tested positive for Covid-19. With tournament rules stating that teams must fulfil their fixtures if they have 11 fit players, Comoros accepted their fate. “We have already chosen an outfield player who will start as a goalkeeper,” said their goalkeeping coach, Jean-Daniel Padovani, who we can only assume had an extremely busy weekend. Without revealing the identity of the poor sod being askedto emulate Hatch in Escape to Victory, he assured fans that “he is a player who, during training, showed that he could play as a goalkeeper”. Fast forward to Monday morning, when it emerged that actual Comoros goalkeeper Ahamada had tested negative for Covid and the subsequent announcement that he would in fact be able to play. Then fast forward a little further to Monday afternoon and the slightly more subsequent announcement from the tournament organisers that, er … actually, no, he won’t. Despite the good news about Ahamada’s test being negative, blazered tournament organisers were quick to point out that Caf rules state a player who tests positive for coronavirus must isolate for five days before taking another PCR test 48 hours before his side’s next match, and therefore Ahamada’s negative was not the positive he and his compatriots originally thought. With several other players and their manager also ruled out of tonight’s game through injury or Covid, Comoros may well ship the mother of all hidings from Cameroon. But whatever the outcome at the Olembe Stadium – and let’s not rule out the possibility of the greatest upset in the history of international football – here’s hoping they leave the pitch with dignity intact and their heads held high.

1/25/2022,"The mother of a 13-year-old boy who drowned in a river in Wales has said her son’s alleged killer has got away “scot free” after the high court dismissed a challenge to a decision by prosecutors not to bring charges over his death. Alina Joseph, the mother of Christopher Kapessa, said: “The [Crown Prosecution Service] have concluded that there is enough evidence to prosecute him for manslaughter.”  She added: “When you take a child’s life … you should have to answer for your actions. But this individual – who took Christopher from us – gets away scot free. “As I feared, this judgment confirms the criminal justice system and the CPS in particular value the welfare of the perpetrator over the life of Christopher and my family.” Christopher drowned in July 2019 after he was allegedly pushed into the River Cynon in south Wales by a 14-year-old boy. In July 2020, the CPS said there was evidence to support a prosecution for manslaughter, but it had decided it was not in the public interest to do so for what it described as a “foolish prank”. In a hearing earlier this month, Michael Mansfield QC, representing Christopher’s family, told the high court in London the decision not to bring charges was legally flawed. Mansfield said prosecutors had misunderstood the culpability of the teenager, giving his youth “undue weight”, and had contradicted their own guidance on homicide cases, which says that “subject to sufficiency of evidence, a prosecution is almost certainly required”. But in a judgment handed down on Monday afternoon, Lord Justice Popplewell and Mr Justice Dove outlined the lengthy process undergone by prosecutors, including a victims’ right to review (VRR), in making the decision not to prosecute. Backing the decision taken in the VRR to overrule the guidance, they said: “That conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the same prosecutorial decision was reached on the same public interest grounds by three other prosecutors with considerable experience and expertise.” They added: “The impact of a prosecution on Q, a child, was clearly an important factor to be taken into account.” Suresh Grover, of the Monitoring Group, who has coordinated Joseph’s campaign said: “The decision is a cruel blow for all of us. It is also a bitter reflection of the prevalence of racism inequality in the criminal justice system. “The perverse judgment disregards Christopher’s right to life and gives more weight to inconvenience that may be suffered by the suspect if he was tried. “How is that just and fair? The alarm bells have been rung forcing us to redouble our efforts to support Alina’s quest for justice.”",News/UK news,Court backs CPS decision not to charge alleged killer of drowned boy,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/24/court-backs-cps-decision-not-to-charge-alleged-killer-of-drowned-boy-christopher-kapessa-wales
1/25/2022,"Earlier today I posted the following video, in which I asked Google Assistant to calculate the factorial of 100.  The factorial of 100 is the multiplication 100 x 99 x 98 x … x 3 x 2 x 1 in which 100 is multiplied by every whole number below it. The answer is 158-digits long. Google Assistant’s valiant effort, however, does not get every digit correct. Today’s puzzle was: How many zeros does the factorial of 100 really have at the end of it? Solution: [I will use the mathematical symbol ‘!’ for factorial below. Thus the factorial of 100 is also written 100!.] I mentioned in the original post that if a number has a zero at the end of it, it is divisible by 10. What we need to do here is work out how many times 10 divides into the number 100 x 99 x 98 x … x 3 x 2 x 1. Let’s start: 10 divides once each into 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and twice into 100, which means there must be at least 11 zeros at the end of 100!. Yet it is possible to multiply two numbers that don’t end in 0 to create one that does. For example, 8 x 5 = 40. How do we account for all the times that numbers in the breakdown of 100! multiply together to make a number divisible by 10? The clue is to realise that 10 = 2 x 5. And that every time two numbers multiply together to create a number that is divisible by 10, there must be a 2 and a 5 involved. E.g. 8 x 5 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 5 = (2 x 2) x (2 x 5) = 4 x 10 = 40. So, we can rephrase our task as having to look for all the instances of (2 x 5) in 100!. In other words, we need to break down every number from 1 to 100 into its factors and see how many times 5 and 2 appear. How many times does 5 appear as a factor in the numbers from 1 to 100? Well, counting upwards in 5s, we get 5, 10, 15, 20…90, 95, 100. These 20 numbers have five as a factor. In fact 25, 50, 75 and 100 have 5 as a factor twice. So the number of times that 5 appears as a factor is 24. We can quickly see that 2 appears as a factor at least 24 times (just count the even numbers), so the total number of times (2 x 5) appears in 100! must be 24. The number of zeros at the end of 100! is 24. For those who are interested, 100! in all its glory is: 93326215443944152681699238856266700490715968264381621468592963895217599993229915608941463976156518286253697920827223758251185210916864000000000000000000000000 Ta-dah!

1/25/2022,"Private healthcare does more than just undermine waiting lists for NHS patients (Hundreds of England’s NHS consultants have shares in private clinics, 21 January). Students, junior doctors and other healthcare professionals need training by senior NHS doctors. When private treatment goes wrong or isn’t enough to fix a problem, private patients end up back in the NHS system to fix any issues ahead of those who have waited. As a junior doctor, I believe that we must keep our NHS public to ensure high standards of care for everyone. But with the NHS increasingly unable to deliver even basic care, I can understand why patients with the means choose to cut the queue. I understand why colleagues choose private work, when NHS constraints force us to lower the quality of our care, under deteriorating working conditions, with ongoing pay erosion.  Neither private patients prioritising their health, nor private clinicians prioritising better working conditions, are the villains here. Those in power who have systematically broken our national healthcare system are to blame. We need to make the NHS the best choice again, for patients and staff, to protect healthcare provision for the poorest and most vulnerable.Name and address supplied  Your article seems to be attempting to paint hospital consultants in a bad light and to say that they are only interested in private practice and making money, possibly in an underhand way by referring patients to private companies that they have shares in. The number of consultants with shares in private healthcare companies (according to the article) is less than 1% of the total number of consultants working in the NHS – the vast majority of whom do not undertake any private practice. This is just the latest in a long line of articles that undermine medical consultants who have trained for years to be able to help people to the best of their ability. It plays into the hands of the current government, which would love to dismantle the NHS and replace it with a US-style insurance system.Gary HartnollRetired consultant neonatologist, Chelsea and Westminster hospital  NHS hospitals in London spent £36m last year to buy a US firm’s private care (Report, 21 January) – there were pressing reasons for doing so. For example, cancer treatments have been delayed by the pandemic. If hospitals could now maintain activity levels 5% above pre-pandemic ones, it will take until 2033 to clear the cancer treatment backlog. However, if activity could be increased to 15% above pre-pandemic levels, the backlog across the cancer care pathway could be cleared by next year. It is feasible that the former activity level could be achieved by the NHS alone, but possibly at the expense of other services, which could be further delayed. It is not possible for the NHS to increase activity by 15% over the pre-pandemic level without finding extra resources, and paying commercial medical services for use of their resources makes sense. Opposing such a pragmatic solution on the grounds that it might promote “creeping backdoor privatisation” is indulging a fantasy. Compared with health services in similar countries, the NHS has relatively poor outcomes for heart disease, strokes and cancer, and needs all the help it can get to improve our health.Steve IliffeEmeritus professor of primary care for older people, University College London  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

After restricting West Indies to eight runs in the 19th over of the match – overs 18 and 20 went for a combined 51 – Topley had completed his allocation for the concession of 18. The only time he has bettered that in any of his 101 T20 outings was when conceding one fewer for Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash League last month. Approaching the fourth anniversary of his decision, midway through the 2018 season, to give up cricket altogether under the continual assault of injuries, the 27-year-old finds himself in the form of his career.  “I think because I’ve had it slightly different than other people that play international cricket, in terms of the journey that I’ve had, I think my perspective is quite unique,” he says of Sunday’s match. “I just sort of embraced all the emotion after the game, or all the messages, whatever you want to call it. I embraced it all but then I’m very good at parking it, you know? I don’t really get too caught up in it. I’m lucky to be playing and I just really enjoyed it. Almost having a second opportunity just makes me value it all a lot more.” Topley’s retirement lasted only a matter of months, before his passion for the game was reignited on a trip to Australia the following winter, but a return to international cricket has taken much longer: Sunday’s game was his first T20 since the 2016 World Cup. But there were no signs of nerves as he dismissed Brandon King with the second ball of the match, and in his second over executed a brilliant run-out to get rid of Shai Hope – replays later showed the batter should have been given out lbw anyway – to set England on what turned out to be an unexpectedly circuitous road to victory. “When I’ve been injured so much, you’d almost bite someone’s hand off to play a T20 and bowl four overs for 40-something,” he says. “It’s almost like, at least I’m out there. It’s not like I haven’t got a competitive instinct, it’s just I’m very realistic about things now, and very level-headed. I think that has boded well for me since coming back and playing, because those pressure scenarios, I just embrace them. That’s the perspective that I’m pretty lucky to have stumbled upon really.” Topley brought something different to England’s team, not just as its only left-arm bowler but because at 6ft 7in he naturally presents an unusual challenge – as England discovered at the hands of the similarly tall Jason Holder in Saturday’s opening match. But in his own opinion what set him apart in the game’s dying moments was the experience that had brought him there – in other words, what was going on inside his head, rather than how far it was off the ground. “In that scenario I think you can just get wrapped up in everything,” Topley says. “The West Indies were behind the eight-ball for a lot of the innings, the fans were quiet, and then suddenly they get some boundaries and they’re all up out of their seats and then the noise was amazing. “It’s the pressure – the whole match becomes a match within a match in those last few overs. You have to isolate each ball, forget what’s happened before and just commit at the end of your mark. There’s games where you’re the good guy, and there’s games where you’re the bad guy. The nature of being the guy that bowls in those key parts of the innings is when it doesn’t fall your way, you’ve got to get up the next day and be just as hungry for the game to be put on your shoulders again.”",Sport/Sport,Reece Topley hits high notes after painful winding road back for England | Simon Burnton,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/24/reece-topley-hits-high-notes-after-painful-winding-road-back-for-england
1/25/2022,"The past few weeks have been a time of discovery for the Conservative party and its supporters. Some Tories as senior as the prime minister himself learned that work events they attended may have, in fact, been boozy parties. Others found out that a man known to be a liar may have, in fact, lied. And now it appears there might be a spot of trouble with Islamophobia. As with “partygate”, the people concerned are appalled by the allegations, are demanding investigations, are asking us to respect the process, and are generally pleading ignorance. Of course, the ignorance in this context is not theirs but ours. For if news of the partying and the alleged discrimination were not leaked to the press, then none of it would really have happened. Just trees falling in silent forests. The allegation comes from the Tory MP Nusrat Ghani, who says that when she was sacked as a junior transport minister in a reshuffle in 2020, party whips told her that her “Muslim woman minister status was making colleagues feel uncomfortable”. The first time this tree fell, Johnson not only heard it, but was informed by Ghani personally. She wrote on Twitter that the prime minister said that “he could not get involved and suggested I use the internal Conservative party complaints process. This, as I had already pointed out, was very clearly not appropriate for something that happened on government business.”  Understandably, she did not follow the internal party inquiry route, and so her extremely serious allegation was forgotten. Now Ghani’s claim has become the subject of a formal inquiry launched by Johnson himself. As it turns out, he could get involved after all. Still, we’ll take it. This is a brief window in which Johnson feels fragile and the Tory-supporting press feels comfortable criticising its man. This means the allegation has the potential to become something that has consequences. It’s a remote possibility, but the fact that it’s on the cards at all seems like a blessing in a country where allegations of Islamophobia within the Conservative party are regularly dismissed, minimised or ignored. The dossier of incidents grows year by year. There was the Singh investigation, which was condemned as a whitewash; the quiet reinstatements of Tory councillors suspended after posting vile comments about Muslims, Arabs, and Asians; and the government’s rejection in 2019 of a working definition of Islamophobia adopted by the major opposition parties. Then there is the long record of incidents involving people whose careers have been wrecked for trying to challenge anti-Muslim prejudice, or, more often than not, saved despite the allegations levelled against them. Sayeeda Warsi has been fruitlessly raising the issue of Islamophobia in general for more than a decade, and in the Conservative party in particular since at least the shameful 2016 London mayoral campaign that Zac Goldsmith waged against Sadiq Khan, in which he accused him of being a threat to London due to implied extremist links. It was a campaign that has had little effect on Goldsmith’s trajectory: after losing his parliamentary seat in 2019, he was appointed to the House of Lords. The campaign was advised by the firm co-founded by Lynton Crosby, a man who, in fine Tory form from the start, also advised Boris Johnson when he was running for mayor, and is reported to have told him to not get hung up on seeking support from “fucking Muslims”. Goldsmith’s mayoral campaign, Johnson’s comments on Muslim women, and their careers since then (as well as Crosby’s, who was knighted in 2016), are only a handful of examples of the shocking passes the party has given for Islamophobia in recent years. Every time this makes the news, Muslims in the party, and Muslim members of the public, issue a cry of distress. If they’re lucky, this gets them a sceptical and combative hearing in the media before the news cycle moves on. Every time, the hearing gets shorter and more perfunctory – a groundhog day in which the fears of Muslims and the realities about hate crime and professional discrimination are brought to the public’s attention, and then dispatched, unaddressed. With every occasion on which nothing changes, Tory Islamophobia is normalised a little bit more; when the next story comes round, it feels slightly less shocking. That applies both to the public and to the victims themselves. I still seethe at the memory of Goldsmith’s campaign, but the futility of the anger has dulled the second healthy, useful part of rage, where one seeks redress, justice and assurances that it won’t happen again. But it will happen again. Because the painful truth about Tory Islamophobia is that it is endorsed by too many voters for it to be a political issue that could really hurt the party; polling from 2019 showed that more than half of Conservative party members believe that Islam is a threat to British values. I hope Ghani receives a rare taste of that redress and apology. But as with all the recent epiphanies about the nature of the Conservatives, the challenge remains far deeper and more complex than anything that could be resolved by the fall of a single person or the clean-up after a single inquiry. Whenever the mirror is finally held up to the Conservative party, for however fleeting a moment, we only see ourselves.

1/25/2022,"I was astonished to read your report about food waste (UK consumers ‘don’t know what to cook’ as £1.2bn of food is binned a year, 20 January). This is the recipe that my sister taught me some 60 years ago: one each potato, carrot, onion, stick of celery. Cut up and fry in butter or oil. Add red lentils, dried herbs and water. Cook for 20 minutes or so. Blend if you have a blender. This is a very forgiving soup – you can add root vegetables, green vegetables, beans, pasta, rice, leftover dinner. My friend adds old cake. We have this for lunch every day in the winter. We are in our 70s and hale and hearty.Judith FurnerEastbourne, East Sussex  Re “Food waste: Are you throwing your money in the bin?” (22 January), the answer is “Unavoidably, yes”, because supermarkets sell fresh produce wrapped and in large portions. Living alone, I cannot use a 1kg bag of potatoes before they rot; similarly with greens or fruit.

1/25/2022,"I live in a small village about two miles from a large town that has high-speed broadband. My experience mirrors your report (19 January) that local governments focus extensively on easy-to-reach urban areas. Money was spent to improve areas that already had high speeds, just from a rival provider. The local project was wound up. Our village was left stuck in the slow lane of 2Mbps speeds. Luckily, a conversation with our local councillor helped resolve this and the village now has a high-speed fibre network.  Given the difference this has made to home schooling and home working, I am deeply frustrated that lessons are being ignored and rural locations are being left behind. We seem to be lining the pockets of the private sector to provide improved services to properties that already benefit from high speeds. Perhaps those in government should attempt to work and study on such slow and unstable connections to understand how frustrating and unfit for purpose rural broadband is.Richard HarrisStanton-on-the-Wolds, Nottinghamshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It should be noted that the 18th century was the age of enlightenment, with a long list of luminaries whose names have become bywords for the possibilities of the thinking and endeavour of which humans are capable. A quick “Kanter” through without racking one’s brain could produce Voltaire, Rousseau, Hume, Wollstonecraft, Hegel, Diderot, Paine et al.  Rees-Mogg’s entire demeanour puts me in mind of a rather more 19th-century precursor – Klemens von Metternich.

1/25/2022,"The world is filled with rock stars who want to be actors. Ringo Starr in The Magic Christian. David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth. Mick Jagger in Ned Kelly. Roger Daltrey in Murder: Ultimate Grounds for Divorce. Basically, throw a brick at any band, and you’re more than likely to concuss a frustrated actor. However, one rock star has so far resisted the urge. True, Brian May has a jam-packed IMDb page thanks to appearances in everything from the video for Queen’s We Will Rock You to the video for 5ive + Queen’s We Will Rock You. However, the closest he has ever come to actually acting was when he performed a song as “Massed peasant chorus” in a long-forgotten, animated Pinocchio adaptation.  But this changes now. Thrillingly, at the age of 74, May has finally and truly become an actor. And even more thrillingly, guess which vehicle he has chosen to embark upon this amazing career change? That’s right, the CBBC comedy series Andy and the Band. Parents will be more than aware of the Andy in question. For years now, Andy Day has all but dominated CBeebies and CBBC. There’s the show where he plays an accident-prone museum worker who has access to a time machine. There’s the show where he plays a safari park worker who can shrink himself. There’s the show where he just plays with some toy dinosaurs. Basically, Andy is great. But you’re not going to easily convince a septuagenarian rock guitarist to shrink himself down to the size of a meerkat very easily, which is why Andy also made Andy and the Band. It’s a series where Andy’s real-life band, Andy and the Odd Socks, embark upon a series of larky Monkees-style adventures that culminate in the performance of a song. It’s very good. You should watch it. However, only one episode contains an appearance by the Queen guitarist, and that is Planet Rock (on CCBC on 27 January, available on iPlayer on 24 January). Although May doesn’t appear for the first half of the show, he makes an enormous impression as the Godfather of Rock. A slightly stilted-looking humanoid alien who lives alone on an alien planet made out of rock, the Godfather of Rock exists to pass on words of wise encouragement to his visitors. The Godfather is visited by his godson, who happens to be a member of the Odd Socks. The godson has an issue pertaining to his ability to play air guitar. May promptly solves the problem and then they all play a song together. Thematically, the character that May seems to be inhabiting most closely in the episode is Rufus, the figure played by George Carlin in the first two Bill & Ted movies. He is elusive yet wise, his evident years of excess softened by his unwavering belief in the power of rock. He seems to exist in a permanent state of surprise, too, either because he has made himself open to all the manifest possibilities of the world, or because he isn’t very good at acting yet. But for a first attempt, May’s acting isn’t that bad. As performances go, it’s certainly better than Vanilla Ice in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, or Jessica Simpson in The Dukes of Hazzard, or Madonna. This was a tricky assignment, and he pulled it off. Now, let’s hope he follows it up with the long-awaited Murder: Ultimate Grounds for Divorce 2.",Arts/Television & radio,"‘Brian May has finally become an actor’: say hello to CBBC’s new star, the Godfather of Rock",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/24/brian-may-has-finally-become-an-actor-say-hello-to-cbbcs-new-star-the-godfather-of-rock
1/25/2022,"From the time he joined Macmillan Publishers as art director in 1966, Nicholas Thirkell, who has died aged 79, did much to overhaul the conventions of book design. He did this by using hardcover jackets to raise “questions which can only be answered by reading the books”, as the Guardian put it in 1970. The observation was prompted by a Design Council exhibition of book covers by Thirkell and his competitor at Heinemann, and future business partner, Mike Dempsey, displaying “a richness and variety in hardback covers which puts posters, for example, to shame”.  Thirkell’s jacket for The Smaller Sky (1967) was a facsimile of a railway ticket, front-and-back, which hurled readers into the brain of John Wain’s protagonist, a suburban clerk who takes up residence in Paddington Station. For a 1969 biography of the first world war naval commander Lord Jellicoe, Thirkell blocked five bands of gold foil on dark blue. A loop in the top stripe instantly called to mind the admiral’s signature coat sleeve. Though he was a thinker more than a draughtsman, Thirkell possessed an uncanny eye for illustration. In the course of overseeing the production of hundreds of covers, he scouted illustrators who were conversant in the possibilities of colour offset printing and eager to make a splash against traditional photographic and typographic jackets. This primed him, in 1970, to assemble for his own firm, Nicholas Thirkell Associates, a quartet of young illustrators, all but one fresh from university, that would dominate British graphics for the next decade. They were the machine-precise George Hardie; Malcolm Harrison, a typographer who excelled in caricature; a surrealist, Bush Hollyhead, working in graphic puzzles and puns; and Bob Lawrie, an Australian expat who married comics to the visual world of Wassily Kandinsky. Plying a combination of pop art, abstraction, and formal design elements, they brought gallery-level rigour to a commercial industry. And they were versatile – equally suited to Penguin paperbacks and glossy monthlies as to counterculture rags and the LP sleeves at Hipgnosis Studio, the photographic firm that challenged listeners to interpret rock music visually. Throughout the 1970s, memorable graphics for Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Paul McCartney and Kevin Ayers were produced by the four illustrators Thirkell had dropped into an open-plan workshop in Victoria, central London. Macmillan continued to rely on his group for jackets. “We were lucky to have this assured income, and it gave us the freedom to be adventurous,” Thirkell wrote in a special issue of Illustrators magazine marking 10th anniversary of the group, which renamed itself NTA Studios after Thirkell left. “We could afford to turn down boring work and take creative risks.” These risks included memorable partnerships with Radio Times, Tommy Roberts’s pop art emporium Mr Freedom, and men’s magazines such as Club International, where – in that heyday of illustration – art directors had the budgets to distinguish editorial content with cutting-edge graphics. Thirkell’s departure came in 1973, after he had grown restless in what had become a managerial role. For 15 months he travelled round India with Priya Kuriako, a colleague from Macmillan. On their return to Britain in 1975 they got married, and he worked as art director at WH Allen. In 1979 he went independent again, this time setting up Nicholas Thirkell & Partners. There he employed a broad array of artists from the burgeoning illustration scene he had helped set in motion. One project was Penguin’s Lives & Letters, a paperback series with evocative period covers. Throughout the 1980s, Thirkell’s thought-driven book design, in which content and packaging worked mutually, earned him awards from and jury placements at industry competitions such as Design & Art Direction and European Illustration. For the bestselling Illustrated Lark Rise to Candleford, Flora Thompson’s trilogy of Victorian Oxfordshire published in a luxury edition in 1983 by Century, four decades after its original publication, Thirkell was invited to go for broke. He did the boards in English polka-dot kerchief, without spine text. A researcher tracked down period photographs, ephemera and flowers to be pressed in the style of a herbarium and photographed in-line with the text. All of this lent Thompson’s pages the feel of an anonymous country scrapbook rather than a carefully wrought hybrid of memoir and fiction. In 1986, with Dempsey and fellow designer Ken Carroll, he formed Carroll Dempsey & Thirkell (CDT). Specialising in corporate identity, they designed for Royal Mail, Our Price, the Barbican and WH Smith. Thirkell’s first job at CDT was looking at the layout for the launch of the Independent newspaper. The editors wanted the impression of longevity and newness at once, what they called “classic with a twist” – clear, authoritative and conservative. Crushed between a deadline and a harried team of editors including Andreas Whittam Smith and Stephen Glover (whose book Paper Dreams documented the frenzied launch and Thirkell’s role in it), he ditched the blocky masthead of the mockup he had been given. Instead, he chose a neoclassical flag based on Bodoni, with chiselled inlines giving it both elegance and heft – a feel echoed by his introduction of Oxford rules (thick and thin) to the column framing. Bucking purists, he mixed different typefaces for the page layout: Century for its novelty and warmth in the headlines, and Times for its clarity in the columns. After refinement from the paper’s design editors and picture editor Michael Crozier, Thirkell’s basic design formed the paper’s first graphic identity and became a case study in successful news layout. His eagle logo, once in-house designers had brought its wings from a roosting position to flight, stayed with the paper throughout major redesigns and the cessation of its print edition in 2016. In 1990, he returned to design the Independent on Sunday. “One of the greatest attributes of a good designer,” Thirkell wrote after the Independent proved a success, “is an understanding of how people think and how they respond to images portrayed by type.” This sensitivity to viewer response was a signature of his career. His talent lay in arranging existing visual realities – and the artists around him – without appearing to make a mark himself. “Nick would sit at his desk, creating tiny sketches with equally tiny written instructions,” recalled Dempsey. “He would wander down the studio in his favourite Savile Row suit, which used to belong to his father, lean over one of his assistants and have a quiet chat; he would then return to his desk, roll up a cigarette and go outside for a smoke.” Born in Epping, Essex, Nicholas was the son of Barbara (nee Baker), who before her marriage was a dancer in stage productions, and John Thirkell, an advertising copywriter. Nicholas left Forest school, Walthamstow, in 1960 after his A-levels. Rather than receiving formal design training, he took a trainee position at Service Advertising, London, and an advertising course at the College for the Distributive Trades (1961-62). In an initial spell of three years with Macmillan he worked as a copywriter and subdesigner. Before returning to the firm as art director he worked at the Planning Unit design studio (1965-66). From then until his retirement in the late 1990s he remained a leading light in the field. Priya survives him, along with their daughters, Nisha and Maya.

That’s if you value your head.  Even those women who left a trail of beer bottles from the Airbnb’s pool to the sauna in the early hours showed up at 9am, enthusiastically dodging head kicks and trying not to get tangled up in passing dogs. Some have had amateur fights already; others are so new to Muay Thai that they have to be shown how to wrap their hands.

A typical day here in Ocean Grove will consist of pad work, sparring and some strength training. But there are also plenty of opportunities to let the hair down after the isolation instilled by Melbourne’s lockdowns, and that’s equally beneficial to wellbeing. Overseeing the action are pro fighters Joanne La and Somsurat Rangkla who, just days before, many of us crowded into the Melbourne Pavilion to watch in action.

Rangkla remembers the first time she saw La fight – climbing on the ropes to posture “like a man” – and being impressed by the fire in her. Though they’ve fought each other in the past, they teamed up to form JS Muay Thai, to introduce women to the fundamentals through courses and retreats like this. ‘My husband asked a very good question: “What’s one thing you wish you had done that you never did before?” And I was like, “I always wanted to be one of those badass chicks in the movies that could look after themselves.”’ – Bridget Jacobson The women here are from all backgrounds.

Deb Doan delivering a sok tong to the author’s head: ‘Muay Thai is an extreme version of just one facet of myself, because I do everything to the extreme.’ During the lockdowns, JS Muay Thai switched to online classes. Many of the camp’s attendees credit these sessions with pulling them out of depression and heavy drinking during that period. Or, as one puts it, “Netflix and waiting to die”.

I wanted to find something to make me feel more confident.’ – Candy Ngo For La, JS Muay Thai is a personal mission. She took up training to pull herself away from self-medicating her trauma. When she was younger, La moved between 20 domestic violence shelters across different states. She swore to never feel powerless again. “I want to create a program for women in shelter homes so that they can feel those connections and the feeling of power, even though it takes time,” she says. “Because I’ve seen it firsthand. They go back to the partner because it’s all they know and they don’t believe in themselves.” ‘There are a lot of barriers to entry for women in martial arts, particularly if you want to be a fighter, because you have to be quite advanced, but when I heard about JS I realised all those barriers were gone.’ – Alison Cheney Fatefully, two weeks after this retreat, Rangkla suffers a devastating injury, tearing her anterior cruciate ligament at the knee. Rangkla moved to Melbourne from Thailand for work 15 years ago, and it’s here that she took up the sport. “In Thailand, Muay Thai was a way to get out of poverty, so not many people did it,” she explains. Now 35 with 11 fights to her name, Rangkla has made the difficult decision to retire, and will devote her time to developing JS Muay Thai. Already, she’s been a huge inspiration to the women drawn into this community.

1/25/2022,"On Monday the government, perhaps realising its electoral fortunes are flagging among its usual demographic of voters, decided to suggest younger voters should get onboard the Liberal party train because they apparently are the ones who have most benefited from its tax cuts. As they say, that’s a bold strategy; let’s see if it pays off for them.  What we find is that while those on lower incomes – who are younger on average than high income earners – did benefit from the first stage of tax cuts, the coming stage three tax cuts will be massively directed towards high income earners, who are decidedly not young. On Monday, Nine newspapers were given a nice drop from the treasurer’s office of figures that purportedly show that “workers aged from 25 to 34 secured the biggest single share of the income tax cuts promised at the last election”. Given the most recent published ATO taxation data is only from 2018-19, we can’t really check the veracity of the statement of Josh Frydenberg that “Australians aged between 25 and 34 are on average more than $3,400 better off due to the government’s tax cuts”. But, pointedly, Nine’s David Crowe notes that “The figures do not include the tax cuts due to start in 2024 and which are controversial because of the benefits for workers on higher incomes.” It’s not actually all that surprising that younger workers did OK under the recent tax cuts. The stage one tax cuts involved the low-to-middle income tax offset (LMTO), then an increase in the low-income tax offset (LITO), which mostly benefitted those earning under $90,000. Stage one was also amended to raise the upper threshold for the 19% tax bracket from $37,000 to $45,000. This also benefited low-middle income earners. But then came stages two and three. Stage two saw a change to the 32.5% and 37% tax-bracket thresholds that mostly benefited those earning over $90,000. Stage three, set to come into effect in 2024-25, flattens the tax rate by removing the 37% bracket and then lowering the 32% rate to 30%, and then for good measure raises the 45% tax threshold to $200,000: If the graph does not display please click here Just how greatly the stage three tax cuts benefit the wealthy is seen when we break down their three elements: If the graph does not display please click here So given stage one mostly benefited lower-middle income people it is no surprise that the government is now saying their tax cuts mostly benefit younger workers, because younger workers on average earn less than older ones and are thus more likely to be in lower tax brackets: If the graph does not display please click here Thirty seven percent of those in their late 20s are in the bottom two tax brackets, compared with around 27% of those in their 40s. The problem for the government’s spin is that these stage one tax cuts were in effect a political necessity if they were going to have any chance of introducing the stage two and three tax cuts, which are actually much bigger. So yes, Frydenberg might be able to say that young people benefited from the tax cuts, but that is only because they were a measure designed to make the overall tax package look fair (or at least fairer). But when you consider that the stage three will benefit to a small extent those earning $50,000 and then to a larger extent those earning over $90,000, $120,000 and $200,000, the suggestion that voting for the Liberal party at the coming election is good for younger workers rather falls flat (and also reveals just how inequitable they are across all ages): If the graph does not display please click here Just 2.6% of those aged 18-24 earned more than $90,000 in 2018-19, compared with 17% of 25-34 year olds and then 29% of those aged 35-64. Only 11% of those aged 25-34 earned over $120,000, compared with 21% of 35-64 year olds. Even worse, however, is the latest finding by the Parliamentary Budget Office that by 2031 all of the tax cuts will be wiped out by bracket creep for those earning under $91,000: If the graph does not display please click here So yes, to an extent the tax cuts since the last election have favoured younger workers. But this is also very much a case of past performance not being indicative of future results. These tax cuts were the nice showroom product that does not look so good when you get it home – especially when you realise the extra charges you have unwittingly agreed to. For now the government has no tax cuts planned that will be overly good for young workers – instead they are skewed toward older, and wealthier, workers. The stage three cuts to come, which are also supported by the ALP, are not equitable either by age or incomes.",News/Business,"If you’re a younger worker in Australia, don’t be fooled on tax cuts | Greg Jericho",https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2022/jan/25/if-youre-a-younger-worker-in-australia-dont-be-fooled-on-tax-cuts
1/25/2022,"Nearly half of all people who sought help with homelessness last year in New South Wales did not get it, a new report has shown. According to data from the Productivity Commission’s annual report on government services, 48.2% of people in Australia’s most populous state who asked for accommodation assistance from specialist homelessness services in the 2020-2021 financial year went without.  That figure represents a substantial increase from five years ago, when 37.2% of people did not receive the help they had requested. The Productivity Commission report, released on Tuesday, contains detailed information on the performance of Australia’s social support services, including housing, homelessness, aged care, youth justice, child protection and more. It shows unmet requests for homelessness accommodation services are increasing across Australia, from 30.2% of people going unassisted nationally in 2016–2017, to 32.2% in the last financial year. But the problem is particularly acute in two of Australia’s three most populous states. The situation has also been steadily worsening in Queensland, where unmet demand for homelessness services is at 35.9%, up 10 percentage points from five years ago, where it sat at 25.9%. In Victoria, meanwhile, the percentage of people who did not get the homelessness services they requested has fallen since 2016 by 5.8 percentage points to 29.8%, though it had been trending slightly upward prior to 2019–2020. The report notes Covid-19 funding and policy initiatives have affected the use of specialist homelessness services and that caution should be used when comparing data across states and territories. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Both NSW and Victoria put temporary accommodation schemes into place for rough sleepers (including accommodation in hotels and motels) during extended lockdown periods, with some providers still in the process of phasing out those programs. However in NSW unmet demand for homelessness services had been increasing alarmingly prior to the pandemic, jumping 4.7 percentage points to 41.9% in 2017-2018 and similarly to 45.2% the following year. This is despite the number of people seeking accommodation assistance from homelessness services in NSW remaining steady – hovering between 46,072 and 47,652 people a year over the past five years – and that state’s investment in homelessness services also remaining flat, at an average of $34.96 a person, per support day. Victoria shows the biggest leap in investment in homelessness services, from $37.63 spent per person per support day five years ago, to $50.34 a person in the last financial year. In early 2021, the Victorian government announced a substantial investment in a homelessness transition program, From Homelessness to a Home. Minor improvements to unmet demand in the homelessness sector could be seen in WA, SA and ACT. Tasmania has the most marked improvement, with the percentage of those missing out on homelessness accommodation dropping from 25.5% in 2016-2017 to 18.4% last year. The Productivity Commission report drew attention to the significant knock-on effects of housing instability, noting: “Housing instability and homelessness can in turn increase vulnerability to adverse social and economic circumstances through, for example, poorer outcomes in education, employment and health, and increased risk of involvement with the justice system.” Women and children experiencing domestic and family violence are disproportionately likely to be among those people seeking specialist homelessness services, with the report noting that 39.4% of people contacting these services identified domestic and family violence as an underlying cause of their need. The Productivity Commission report only analysed known demand – that is, people who have sought homelessness services and had that need for accommodation identified, drawn from unpublished data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare – and therefore does not capture those in the community who may have unidentified need. The report did not assess the quality of homelessness service provision, despite that being one of the eight key performance indicators for the sector, as it said “there are currently no nationally agreed quality standards for specialist homelessness services”. For those who have access to housing, rental stress – spending more than 30% of gross household income on rent – remains an ongoing issue, with low income earners particularly susceptible to housing instability in the private sector. The report noted that even for those people receiving commonwealth rental assistance payments, 45.7% still experienced rental stress. The report did not make data on waiting times for public or community housing available, though these have previously been reported as varying between three months and more than five years, depending on location and individual circumstances of the applicant.",News/Australia news,"Almost half of people seeking help for homelessness in NSW in past year did not get it, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/25/almost-half-of-people-seeking-help-for-homelessness-in-nsw-in-past-year-did-not-get-it-report-finds
1/25/2022,"Concession card holders said they found it impossible to track down rapid antigen tests, on the first day of a federal government program offering access to free tests. The scheme, which allows pensioners and concession card holders to access up to 10 free rapid antigen tests over three months through their chemist, had a difficult start on Monday, with supply issues hampering anyone attempting to procure the tests.  Rosanna, who asked to remain anonymous, lives in rural Victoria and said she needed rapid antigen tests to protect her father Lorry, who is critically ill. But there were none available at any of the pharmacies within an hour’s drive from her home, leaving the family in a precarious situation. “We’re really scared of what’s going to happen to him, and we’re furious with the government for the position that they’ve left Australians in,” she said. “We are really quite devastated that the vulnerable people in our community have been completely dismissed [and] dehumanised. “It just feels like my father is expendable to this government.” Rosanna’s father has stage four bowel cancer and attends chemotherapy every two weeks. She said he needs the tests for himself and the carers he depends on, and that even if the local pharmacies were supplied, she feared the tests would be gone by the time she gets there. “Even the 10 tests offered over three months is not enough to keep my dad going, and we can’t afford to buy them in bulk. And even if we could, we can’t find them. “The whole scheme is, in my opinion, absolutely ridiculous. It’s not enough that the vulnerable in our communities need to rely on it.” Rosanna said the situation was so critical she has decided to move in with her father to be able to care for him. “It means he’s taking a gamble on every person that walks through the door, as to whether or not he will make it through the next month. We just feel completely forgotten.” An NDIS recipient from Brisbane said his eight-year-old immunocompromised daughter was at great risk without the tests, and told Guardian Australia the program was a “complete shambles”. “The fact that they couldn’t come up with a process in time seems pretty risky. And it’s worse when you speak to pharmacies and they sound despondent.” The recipient, who asked to remain anonymous, said without the tests the family needed to isolate themselves to protect her. “It’s really frustrating, and now we have a dilemma in that we need to go to the hospital regularly but it’s too dangerous, and we have not worked out how we’re going to manage it without the tests. “There’s not much we can do, we’re basically homebound now.” He said he’d been searching for tests since early January. “I was a bit shocked when I couldn’t find any, because when the government announced a set date for the scheme, I thought they would have the tests available.” It is a similar situation to the one faced by Connor Alexander from Melbourne, who lives on a disability pension with a chronic illness, and has been scrambling for the free tests, to no avail. “It’s left me feeling very stressed. None of us want to get sick but I just I want to be prepared as best I can. I don’t want to have to line up and get a PCR test every time I get a cough or a cold and risk getting sick while waiting. “Its infuriating, honestly. This should have been taken care of a long time ago, and it’s getting worse as more people get sick.” Alexander went to “at least four or five” chemists on Monday, searching for the tests, and found none. “It can’t keep going on like this, we need to have some sort of solution to make this happen faster.” The federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said it was “extraordinary” that pensioners and concession card holders were unable to find the tests on the first day of the program. “We all knew that once we opened up … elimination tests would be an important part of the response to keep people safe, and the government simply didn’t do anything about it,” he told Radio National. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told Sky News supply chain “pressures” were being felt all over the world. “We’ve seen seven million [tests] arrive into Victoria in just recent weeks,” Frydenberg said. “We have, right through this pandemic, helped fund and secure tests.”",News/Australia news,‘We’re furious’: Australian concession card holders unable to find free rapid antigen tests,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/25/were-furious-on-first-day-of-free-rapid-antigen-tests-concession-card-holders-couldnt-find-one
1/25/2022,"Anthony Albanese will open the election year with a new $440m pitch to help students and teachers manage the challenges of the pandemic, promising new grant funding for better ventilation, building upgrades and mental health services. Timing the spending pledge with the imminent return to school, the Labor leader will use a scene-setting speech at the National Press Club on Tuesday to appeal to parents battling anxiety about the resumption of classroom-based learning.  Albanese will declare the nation can emerge from the pandemic stronger and more prosperous if Australians are prepared to elect a government prepared to listen, learn and adapt, plan for the future, and be a “force for good”. Borrowing Scott Morrison’s oft-repeated declaration that Australia must “push through” the Omicron wave rather than retreat to restrictions and lockdowns, Albanese will argue careful preparation and constant learning from past experience is more important than pushing through challenges. “We need to learn from [the pandemic], we need to use what the last two years have taught us to build a better future,” Albanese will say. The new schools policy proposal is a grants-based program. Schools would apply for funding to improve air quality with measures such as better ventilation, building more outdoor classrooms, replacing any boarded-up windows and doors and buying air purifiers. Funding for ventilation improvements would be available to all schools – both public and private – on a needs basis. But $188m in the program earmarked for broader upgrades of school facilities, including refurbishing school buildings or building trades training centres, would only be available to public schools. As well as grants for upgrades, Labor will promise funding to support mental wellbeing. Schools will determine how to allocate the resources, but options include funding for additional school counsellors and psychologists, or for activities that improve children’s wellbeing. The proposal will include a voluntary mental health check tool to help identify students in need of additional support. Funding for mental wellbeing initiatives will be available to both public and private schools. Albanese will also flag a departmental review of the impact of the pandemic on students with a disability. Albanese will acknowledge concerns parents have expressed in the lead up to the new school year, and will criticise the prime minister for failing to accelerate the vaccination of students in time for a return to the classroom. The Labor leader will acknowledge the stress Australian families have faced in 2020 and 2021. “Remote learning, exam chaos, cancelled sport, and now the delays in vaccine supply, have turned what should be some of the best years of [children’s] lives into a cascade of stress and uncertainty,” he will say. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Albanese will note some students have fallen behind academically, while others are stressed and socially anxious. “Parents are [also] stressed from home schooling; anxious about the weight the pandemic has put on their children’s shoulders.” The Labor leader will argue parents are looking for guidance from the Morrison government, but that the prime minister has failed to exercise leadership. He will contend voters “are waiting in vain for Scott Morrison to come good on his vows”. He will characterise the prime minister as a “man who stood before the country and promised a national plan for getting our children back to school – but didn’t deliver one”. “[Morrison] promised a national approach in which his government would work with the states – instead he did what he always does: he palmed off his share of the work on to the states. “The states have done a great job in picking up the slack of the slackest government in living memory”. Albanese will declare education is fundamental and essential to the jobs, productivity and prosperity of the future – “and education is the biggest and most powerful weapon we have against disadvantage”. The opposition leader will tell voters if Labor wins the coming election, he will see it as his “fundamental responsibility” to repay the sacrifices made by Australians during the pandemic – “to reward these efforts, to prove worthy of the generosity and bravery of the Australian people”. Albanese says a government he would lead would ensure Australians had access to “a strong public health system, with Medicare as its backbone”; tackle the rise of insecure work; boost sovereign capability; invest in broadband and childcare and stop funding cuts for technical eduction.",News/Australia news,Labor promises $440m to help students and teachers manage challenges of pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/25/labor-promises-440m-to-help-students-and-teachers-manage-challenges-of-pandemic
1/25/2022,"While my short, accident-prone, yes-I’ll-catch-that-disease-inclined body has been the recipient of other people’s blood donations on multiple occasions, due to rarely making the 50kg minimum weight, I usually don’t qualify for donating blood. I’ve never been able to pay it forward. I like to think my friend Madeleine, of far superior athletic build, is doing it for me by proxy. I’ve known Madeleine for almost 20 years, but only recently found out she is one of the selfless individuals who religiously gives blood and has been for decades.  “I do it because I can … I’m healthy, so why not?” She shrugs. “And I know that I’m directly helping someone. So how good is that?” Now, more than normal, Australia needs people like Madeleine. The Red Cross’s Lifeblood program is chalking up a record number of no-shows, with half of the nation’s blood donation appointments going unattended. “We need 140,000 new blood donors in 2022 to meet the needs of patients across Australia, an increase of 45%,” Lifeblood’s executive director of donor services, Cath Stone, said. “Our existing donors can’t do it alone.” It takes only 10 minutes to donate the standard 470ml of blood that can save up to three lives. The Australia Red Cross has an online postcode search for the closest donor centre here and an online eligibility test here. The eligibility test is advised, given there are more than 360 reasons why someone may not be eligible to donate, relating to individual health conditions, medications, countries recently travelled to, pregnancy and breastfeeding, sexual activities and age. While becoming one of those donors is relatively straightforward – as long as you’re not afraid of needles – Madeleine takes her commitment to another level. On her half day off every other Friday, she rides her bike to Sydney Town Hall and donates her plasma too. The process takes about two hours. Her blood is taken, placed in a centrifuge so the plasma rises to the top for extraction, and then the rest is infused back into Madeleine. This means she can donate every two weeks, instead of the standard 12 weeks required between conventional blood donations. For her, it’s just “such a small thing to give up, something I can easily remake myself”. So make rolling up your sleeve and booking a donation a priority this year, by calling 13 14 95, or downloading the free Donate Blood app. It might not be the easiest thing you do that day, but it will probably be the most impactful.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Easy wins: ‘Giving blood, I know I’m directly helping someone.

I want to talk about the first time I met and played with Archie Roach. It was 1989 and it was with my band, the Messengers. We’d been offered a show at the Melbourne Concert Hall [now Hamer Hall]. And it was a big deal for us – it was like, “All right, this is the big time,” so we wanted to do a special show. Around that time, [the late] Steve Connolly, who played guitar for me, saw Archie Roach singing Took the Children Away on an ABC TV show called Blackout. He said to me we should get this guy to come and open for us at the Concert Hall. I hadn’t heard the song but I trusted Steve.  Our agent tracked him down and we got him to the show. We were backstage ready to go on, and all of us were quite toey – we were very nervous. Archie arrived and I went and introduced myself and welcomed him. I would have thought I would have said my name, because that’s what I normally do but Archie was probably really nervous too, and I think he didn’t hear me, because he later said he thought I was the security guy. Anyway, I said good luck and he went on and did his set. It was just a short 20-minute set, and we were to go on straight after him. So he did two long songs and the second one was Took the Children Away. I was watching from the side – I had goosebumps and the hairs went up on the back of my neck as he sang it, to dead silence from the audience. He finished the song and there was still dead silence. He just stood there for a minute, and there was still silence. Archie thought he’d bombed, that everybody hated it, so he just turned and started to walk off stage. And as he walked off, this applause started to build and build and build. It was this incredible reaction. I’d never seen it before – people were so stunned at the end of the song that it took them a while just to gather themselves to applaud. Me and my band walked straight on. Here I am talking about the most memorable gig of my life and I don’t remember a thing about what we did! Hopefully we did a good show. And when we finished, Archie had gone, into the night.

1/25/2022,"The inland rail is a political dream that winds back into pre-federation days. The first version was laid out by Henry Parkes in his Tenterfield address of 1889, as he made the case for a national government. Such a move would also need a national army and a “nationwide uniform gauge railway line”. Parkes wanted to connect South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland by rail, “an immense advantage in the movement of troops”.  More than 100 years later the modern founder of the inland rail, Everald Compton, took his dream to John Howard. He envisaged a railway to service country areas and link farmers to ports. Compton’s 1996 plan went from Melbourne via Parkes and Goondiwindi to Toowoomba. From there, the line would run to the port of Gladstone before setting off across country to Emerald and ultimately Darwin via Cloncurry. The current route promises an express service to deliver freight from somewhere outside Melbourne to somewhere outside Brisbane in less than 24 hours – not counting truck connections. It is based on a 2015 business case by the former Nationals leader John Anderson, costed at the time at $4.7bn. In the 2017 budget, the then treasurer Scott Morrison announced an $8.4bn equity injection into the Australian Rail Track Corporation as “one of the biggest investments ever seen in regional Australia”, supporting 16,000 jobs. As an equity injection, it was not counted as part of the budget deficit. Morrison promised the line would benefit “not just Melbourne and Brisbane, but all the regions along its route”. But last year’s Senate inquiry into the inland rail told a different story. It found “the interests of rural, regional and urban communities throughout Victoria, NSW and Queensland have been sidelined by an arbitrary time threshold” – the 24-hour window to deliver freight from end to end. It was critical of the government’s reliance on a 2015 business case while costs had risen to $14.3bn. It noted predictions were now closer to $20bn. “Whether Inland Rail’s 2015 business case remains valid in light of the substantial increase in capital required for its completion is a key question,” the report said. “It is the committee’s view that this substantive increase in the cost of Inland Rail alone warrants a review and update of the 2015 business case.” The interim chief executive for ARTC Inland Rail, Rebecca Pickering, said in a statement that the ARTC recognised some parts of the freight industry and communities living along the route felt their views had not been adequately considered. “We have heard the call from stakeholders who expected more from our early engagement on Inland Rail and we have continued to improve as the project progressed,” she said. “Building Inland Rail is about working together and our priority is to continue to work with landowners, key stakeholders and government through respectful engagement and consultation.” ARTC’s latest projection is for 21,500 direct and indirect jobs to be created by the inland rail project. “In fact more than 2,500 Australians have already worked on construction of Inland Rail and more than $150m has already been spent with local businesses – we expect these benefits to be duplicated along the railway alignment,” Pickering said. Critics have called the project a National party “boondoggle”, pointing out that Anderson’s business case found it would not make money back over 50 years. Certainly, the rail has been pushed by National party leaders since Anderson, and former leader Warren Truss is currently chairman of the ARTC. One fundamental question rolls up and down the 1,700km route – who is the line for? NSW Farmers Association’s Adrian Lyons, who has led campaign to ensure farmers are fairly treated, says there is still no clear economic and social justification for the rail line and no clear value back to agriculture. His members have had properties cut in half and have warned ARTC and the federal government that flooding issues will create havoc for the line. “They are playing politics, they are not looking for the 100 year vision, they are looking for the now,” says Lyons. “We have done everything we possible can, attended the enquiries, written submissions but when it does get going, all we will be able to do is say we told you so, on the flooding. You will get what you pay for.” Others support the idea of inland rail but see the current plan as a missed opportunity. They point to the uncertainty surrounding the route which has left landholders bearing the cost of changing decisions and in some cases unable to sell their properties. There is also a lack of clarity about where the line will end in Melbourne and Brisbane. If it does not go direct to their ports, which would entail huge costs, they would need to unload their goods at the final terminal and send them by truck the rest of the way. And there are cultural concerns. Taje Fowler, a descendant of the Wurundjeri nation with family connection to the Wiradjuri nation and who has family in Narromine, says “young Indigenous people are trying to hold on to our heritage while ARTC is whittling it away”. “It’s devastating to see the project is still going ahead without the steps being put in place to do it the right way. “As a First Nations woman it is my cultural responsibility to protect the land – we have around 2% of untouched land left in the central west.” But above all there is a lack of transparency around the choice of the route and where trains will stop, leading to scepticism and frustration. The chief executive of the Country Women’s Association, Danica Leys, says the benefits to many agricultural areas would be far outweighed by the costs. “There are whole towns and communities that are watching the rail line go past but not having a point anywhere near them to onload or offload agriculture produce,” she says. “They take the brunt of the burden of this infrastructure without being able to get anything from their region on the train.” The late Tim Fischer, another former National party leader and a rail buff, supported the line but said the beneficiaries would be the big freight companies in Melbourne and Brisbane and logistics hubs such as Parkes. “There will be zero advantage for the small railway siding towns, even the ones with extended passing loops, other than the construction phase of inland rail and the upgrading to the standards necessary,” he told the ABC in 2017. Other industries also have a strong interest in the line. Coal is expected to be a major freight item, according to Anderson’s 2015 business case. “The coal task in 2025 represents over half of the total demand for Inland Rail by volume,” he found. And when the Santos coal seam gas project at Narrabri was approved by the NSW government, the Nationals MP for Parkes, Mark Coultan, said gas combined with the “transformational inland rail” would give the town the potential to be “one of our significant manufacturing hubs”. Coultan has supported inland rail since his first parliamentary speech. He believes support for it will increase as compensation rolls out and the route is finalised. “It’s not always the people that are the most outraged that are the most disadvantaged,” he told Guardian Australia. With the terminal location in Brisbane still unconfirmed, the current National party leader, Barnaby Joyce, has proposed instead extending the line from Toowoomba to Gladstone and has committed $10m to a business case which will cost the extension. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter A spokesperson for Joyce said the link to Gladstone “could deliver better rail connectivity and expand access to export markets for regional Australian agricultural and mineral commodities along the route”. “Once complete, Inland Rail will move goods and commodities around Australia to where they are needed – putting stock on supermarket shelves and food on plates while ensuring our mining and agriculture products can continue to be sold internationally to support regional jobs and communities.” At 90, Everald Compton remains wedded to the cause – but not in its current form. He still receives letters from communities along the route who are being torn apart by the project. “People would be willing to make sacrifices for a rail that’s going to help them, but not for a rail that’s not going to help them at all,” he says. “The National party is supposed to be there to enhance inland Australia. Instead, inland Australia is being used to service the two capital cities.” Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community",News/Australia news,"Australia’s inland rail: a long-held dream, but for whom and at what cost?",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/25/australias-inland-rail-a-long-held-dream-but-for-whom-and-at-what-cost
1/25/2022,"Aged care providers are telling essential visitors to find their own rapid tests or be denied entry as the industry grapples with what it describes as a “dire need” for the devices. The huge demand for rapid antigen tests is posing yet another Covid-related barrier to those wanting to visit their loved ones in aged care, something crucial for residents’ physical and emotional wellbeing.  The commonwealth says it has provided 6.6m rapid tests so far to the sector and has also instructed that they be used for visitors, in cases where providers are mandating a negative rapid test before entry. The measure is designed to prevent isolation among residents by relieving visitors of the burden of paying for and hunting down large volumes of rapid tests to facilitate their regular visits to loved ones. But Guardian Australia has seen evidence of at least one provider mandating that visitors record a negative rapid antigen test, while telling them it was “not able to provide these tests to visitors beforehand”. Both the Council on the Ageing (Cota), a peak group for older Australians, and the main workforce union, the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation (ANMF), said the uncertain supply of rapid antigen tests in the sector was posing significant problems. Cota chief executive, Ian Yates, said it was “true that you will find providers that are not [providing rapid tests]” to visitors, and said he had raised the issue through the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. Yates said erecting barriers to visitation threatened residents “physical and mental and emotional wellbeing, particularly for people with dementia”. “In principle, if you’re a regular visitor, and the home is requiring [a rapid test], it should be providing you with the RAT,” he said. “And it shouldn’t be requiring them of you any more often than staff.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Leading Age Services Australia (Lasa), the industry’s national peak body, said the government was currently giving priority to getting supplies to facilities experiencing an outbreak. But spokesperson Sean Rooney said the government had yet to fully commence the proactive distribution of rapid antigen tests to providers not experiencing an outbreak, after announcing plans to do so on 23 December. “Notwithstanding an improvement in RAT and PPE supplies last week, many providers are still in dire need of RATs and PPE. Lasa staff have been escalating these requests with government,” he said. Rooney said the sector was continuing to meet with ministers and the department on a range of pressing issues posed by Omicron, including “a stable and secure program for the distribution of RATs and PPE to residential aged care providers and home care operators”. “The department has been prioritising distribution of PPE and RAT and provided assurance that the supply chain issues which have hampered distribution are being addressed,” he said. ANMF federal assistant secretary, Lori-Anne Sharp, said staff who worked at facilities with rapid test mandates were being put in positions of enormous stress. Sharp said the high demand for rapid tests meant providers were closely protecting the supplies they did have. “If residents’ families could access them for free in the community, it wouldn’t be an issue. But they can’t,” she said. “In Germany, they’ve got them in vending machines. They send them to the home in some countries.” The industry has adopted its own code for visitation during the pandemic. It requires that residents are always permitted to have at least one essential visitor. Essential visitors are deemed either partners in care, named visitors, or anyone in the case of end of life care. “Access by essential visitors should always be facilitated on a regular basis,” the code says. Aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, was contacted for comment. Health minister, Greg Hunt, said on Monday the federal government had focused its supply of rapid tests to the aged care sector. “We have been in the market and supplying since August, and we have been able to provide continuous supply of over 6.6m rapid antigen tests to aged care,” he said. “And so, in relation to priority populations, that is one of the things that we have been able to do, is to foresee, to acquire and to supply throughout the course of not just Omicron, but before Omicron ever existed.”",News/Australia news,BYO rapid antigen tests for essential visitors to enter Australian aged care facilities,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/25/byo-rapid-antigen-tests-for-essential-visitors-to-enter-australian-aged-care-facilities
1/25/2022,"Scott Morrison enters a federal election year with his approval languishing at levels not seen since March 2020, and the Coalition’s handling of the Omicron wave has prompted some voters to signal they are now less likely to back the government on polling day. The first Guardian Essential poll of 2022 confirms the prime minister’s approval rating (46%) hasn’t budged since last December, and disapproval of Morrison is up two points to 46%.  The Morrison government had hoped to recover standing with voters over the summer break, but the desired political fillip hasn’t eventuated. The prime minister needs to recover lost ground – voter approval of Morrison dived 19 points during the controversies and missteps of 2020. While the uptick in voter disapproval of the prime minister during January falls inside the survey’s margin of error, more emphatic is voter disillusionment over the government’s handling of the pandemic. Last December, 41% of respondents rated the federal response to Covid as good. After the challenging summer of Omicron – with surging case numbers, increased numbers of deaths, and rolling controversy over shortages of rapid antigen tests – only 35% of respondents think the Morrison government is doing a good job, while 38% (up from 32%) of the sample describes the response as poor. Ominously for the government, Morrison’s performance over the summer has also prompted 37% of respondents to say they are now less likely to vote for the Coalition at the federal election expected in May – although 19% say events have made it more likely they will stick with the incumbents. The latest data suggests voters are concerned about the surge in cases, and a shortage of rapid antigen tests remains a hot button issue – 38% of respondents say they are less likely to vote for the government based on their handling of that issue. There is significant lived experience in the community – 26% of respondents say they have have tried but have been unable to procure a RAT test in the last month. If the current negative sentiment holds or accelerates, the latest Guardian Essential data suggests the Coalition would go backwards on polling day. Also challenging electorally for Morrison is a plunge in voter approval of the New South Wales government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Only 37% of respondents now rate the Perrottet government’s management of the pandemic as good – down from 54% in December. Morrison needs the Coalition to poll strongly in New South Wales to secure a fourth term. While the mood has soured in New South Wales, public sentiment appears to have rebounded marginally in Victoria, with 47% saying the Andrews government is doing a good job (up from 43% in December). Voter support for the state responses to the pandemic in Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia also went backwards in January as case numbers surged after restrictions lifted. While the new poll shows Morrison and some of his state counterparts have endured a difficult summer, the deportation of tennis star Novak Djokovic was a winner with the Coalition’s base, with 43% of self-identified Liberal and National supporters nominating that controversy as a reason to vote for the Coalition at the looming election. Looking at Labor, Anthony Albanese’s approval and disapproval metrics have not shifted decisively over the summer break. On the latest numbers, 39% of respondents approve of the opposition leader’s performance and 39% disapprove (23% of the sample say they don’t have a view). But Albanese has closed the gap between himself and Morrison in the poll’s better prime minister measure (42% say Morrison is the better prime minister, while 34% say Albanese, which is up three points since December). Voters were also asked about their priorities for government in 2022. Additional health investments topped the list, with 54% of respondents putting that issue in their top three. Nearly half the sample want more investments in systems like aged care and childcare. Next on the list is action to combat global heating, and reducing cost of living pressures.",News/Australia news,Guardian Essential poll: disillusion growing over Coalition handling of pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/25/guardian-essential-poll-disillusion-growing-over-coalition-handling-of-pandemic
1/25/2022,"Financial news has started to turn negative, both at home and abroad. Is the debt-fuelled party that has provided solace amid the pandemic as well as jobs and rising asset prices for millions if not billions about to end?  There are certainly some near-term nasties but the larger and more serious threats are geopolitical and difficult to predict – including the next stage of the Covid pandemic – or of our own making. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of the economic challenges we face. First up, Omicron has been around for more than a month but the more infectious Covid variant hasn’t – so far – derailed financial markets. Sure, there’s mass absenteeism of infected or close-contacted staff, upsetting supply chains in Australia where many businesses have started to disclose fears of running out of cash. And, globally, firms are scrambling to secure inputs for everything from cars to fertilisers. Monday’s financial media warned of brewing market turbulence, as the binary world of punters are apparently shifting from “risk on” to “risk off”. US stocks dropped more than 5% last week, reportedly the worst return since Covid got serious in March 2020. The famously tech-heavy Nasdaq was about 14% lighter since the start of this year. But a bigger plonk, though, is coming from the cryptic world of crypto-currency. The Washington Post over the weekend estimated digital tokens had “vaporised” $US1.4tn (almost A$2tn) in just two months as the ethereal market halved in value. When Australia’s sharemarket opened on Monday, stocks duly dived about 1%. By close of play, though, losses were a more modest 0.5% – not a savaging by any measure. Still, there’s a big week or so ahead for financial markets. The big bugbear is inflation with nations such as Britain and the US recording their fastest price spurt in decades, and the US Federal Reserve meeting for two days this week to signal if higher interest rates are coming sooner than flagged. Those with variable-rate mortgages know having to repay more on a loan typically discourages purchases of everything else. One’s sense of wealth, too, takes a hit if others become less willing to borrow as much for property, nixing the chances of repeating last year’s 25% run-up in average Australian “home values”, for instance. For Australia, the next glimpse of inflationary pressures lands on Tuesday, when the ABS releases December-quarter consumer price figures. The headline figure of 3% or so will largely be ignored, with attention focusing on the trimmed mean – a gauge that strips out the more transient spiky movements. The expected 2.4% rate will be the highest in more than seven years, and will renew fears Australia’s Reserve Bank will move earlier than its 2023-24 projected first rise in official rates. Westpac last week brought forward its tip for the first RBA move to this August, a shift that gained more credence after another strong job recruitment month – at least before the Omicron disruptions kicked in. Analysts like Nathan Roost, a logistics expert at consultancy Ernst and Young, reckons we have about six weeks or so of supply shortages to get through. One lesson learned, he says, is we need investment not just in highly efficient, just-in-time supply networks, but also a more resilient workforce. Even so, “there’s this pent-up demand for lots of things, services, goods, travel” which will remain as an underlying driver of the Australian economy for the next six to nine months. “There’s a shock clearly in the short term, but I think longer term, the economic momentum will remain somewhat positive,” Roost says. The OECD, too, expects growth this year to be a robust 4.5%, down from 5.6% in 2021, but rosier than the 3.2% predicted for 2023 as Covid-related stimulus packages peter out. Other economists, though, offer a less sanguine view. Stephen Anthony, a former Australian Treasury official, and now chief economist with consultancy Macroeconomics Advisory, argues the central banks have shed credibility and distorted economies as they have become massive investors in economies. The RBA, for instance, has been buying up Australian debt, mostly federal, at the rate of $4bn a week to push down bond prices and so, lower the cost of borrowing to stoke economic activity. Debt holdings exceed $330bn, and amount to the bank “owning a third of the yield curve”, Anthony says. In a recent paper released through the Australian National University’s Agenda journal, Anthony argued the RBA was a latecomer to so-called quantitative easing but had done much to close the gap with counterparts in the US, Japan, Europe and elsewhere.

It’s something you just can’t get rid of it.” In other words, withdrawing support would probably trigger a market selldown by investors that would bring back that same central bank binge to avoid an economic collapse. Satyajit Das, another independent economist, warns of similar excesses and the limited options for Australia’s leaders in his latest book, Fortune’s Fool, scheduled to be published by Monash University in March. “Policymakers are skint,” Das says, adding that the trust of governments and central banks, dimmed by the global financial crisis and subsequent super-bubbles, has been further diminished in the current Covid crisis. “If they had retooled their economies, if they’d invested massively where there’s a stream of income that’s going to amortise the debt on the other side, I’m very relaxed” about the debt build up, he says. “You can’t get funding consumption from borrowing” as they have done for 30 years, Das says. “That’s the problem that they’ve created and now they are kind of trapped.” Das says investors are poor at picking geopolitical issues, although he doesn’t think a Russian invasion of Ukraine is likely to be a big threat. For one, Russia’s Vladimir Putin will not be keen to disrupt China’s Winter Olympics run by his mate Xi Jinping. Another is the Pinsk Marshes, a giant bog covering much of Ukraine’s border that has stalled other armies in the past, will soon start to thaw as spring approaches, Das says. Other surprises though could include China clamping down on its supply chains to eliminate Covid. Another threat is also not going away: climate change. “The other risk … is extreme weather events,” Das says. “They have massive costs, and they have massive disruptive values, and nobody seems to even be talking about those any more.”",News/Business,Australia’s economic outlook for 2022: is our debt-fuelled pandemic finance party over?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/25/australias-economic-outlook-for-2022-is-our-debt-fuelled-pandemic-finance-party-over
