5/10/2022,"By Elaine Lies TOKYO (Reuters) - An Elon Musk tweet saying Japan would ""eventually cease to exist"" without a higher birthrate set off a flood of sarcasm and anger on Monday - though much of the angst was aimed at a Japanese government many said did little to address the issue. Musk, the head of electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc, at the weekend tweeted, ""At risk of stating the obvious, unless something changes to cause the birth rate to exceed the death rate, Japan will eventually cease to exist. This would be a great loss for the world."" The comment hit a nerve among Japan watchers and in Japan, whose population peaked in 2008 and has declined since due to its low birthrate to about 125 million as of last year despite government warnings and sporadic attempts to grapple with the issue. But Japan remains the world's third-largest economy, host to global heavyweights ranging from car manufacturers to games developers, and is a key link in global semiconductor supply chains. ""What is even the point of tweeting this?"" wrote Tobias Harris, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. ""The anxieties surrounding Japan's demographic future is not that 'Japan will eventually cease to exist' but rather the profound social dislocations that are occurring as a result of the decline to a lower population level."" Others noted sluggish birthrates plague many nations besides Japan, including Germany - where Tesla has just opened a new factory - and that Japan was simply being hit first. But many Japanese commentators said the situation was not surprising and slammed their government for not doing enough to fight it, such as by providing more daycare centres and making it easier for women to return to work after having children. ""They keep saying the birthrate's falling, but given that the government isn't taking thorough steps to deal with it, what can we say? Everything they say and do is contradictory,"" wrote Twitter user SROFF. ""In this environment, who's going to say 'Okay, let's have a child'? I despair for Japan.""

5/10/2022,"Alabama jail guard Vicky White fatally shot herself as she and escaped murder suspect Casey White were being chased by law enforcement in Indiana on Monday, ending an extraordinary 11 days on the run that captivated the nation. “We’ve captured them,” Vanderburgh County Sheriff Dave Wedding said in Evansville, Indiana, a five-hour drive from the Florence, Alabama, lockup the pair had vanished from. Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton, Vicky White’s former boss, told reporters: “We got a dangerous man off the street today. He is never going to see the light of day again. That is a good thing—for not just our community. That’s a good thing for our country.” After Vicky White signed Casey White out of jail for a phantom court appointment, the duo kept a step ahead of investigators—fleeing Alabama for parts unknown. End of police chase — Evansville, Indiana. Car badly damaged. pic.twitter.com/8KMN8rezxm — Brian Entin (@BrianEntin) May 9, 2022 It appears they were eventually undone by a stolen car. Late last week, investigators found Vicky White’s rust-colored SUV in a tow yard after the Whites abandoned it off an interstate near Bethesda, Tennessee. Authorities said another car, a black Ford pickup truck, was reported stolen in the same area around the same time. Investigators tracked the truck to Evansville, about 100 miles north of Bethesda, on Monday. A man who resembled Casey White was spotted exiting the vehicle at the car wash, officials said, citing surveillance images. A Sunday night tip led federal marshals and police to a hotel, where they set up surveillance. On Monday, Vicky White came out wearing a wig and got into a gray vehicle with Casey White, Northern District of Alabama U.S. Marshal Marty Keely told CNN. Investigators tailed the Whites—who are not related—and a chase ensued. It ended with the fugitives’ vehicle in a rollover crash. “U.S. Marshals task force officers intercepted them—actually collided with them to end the pursuit,” Wedding said. “We got Casey White out who immediately announced that his wife had shot herself in the head and that he didn’t do it,’’ Keely said, adding that the Whites were not married. Vicky White, 56, was taken to a hospital with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, while 38-year-old Casey White was taken into custody. Several outlets later reports that Vicky White had died. When asked if it was surprising that Vicky White had pulled the trigger, rather than her road-trip buddy, a hardened criminal with a reported death wish, Wedding mused: “With criminals and criminal minds, they are very unpredictable. We don’t take anything they say with merit and they can change on a dime.” Vicky White, the Lauderdale County jail’s assistant director of corrections, was by all accounts a model employee for the first 25 years she worked at the facility. Then, on April 29, she told co-workers she was taking Casey White to a mental health appointment at the courthouse. They never arrived. “You don’t know who you can trust,” Singleton told reporters. “You know, I had every bit of trust in Vicky White. She had been an exemplary employee. And what in the world provoked her, or prompted her, to pull something like this, I don’t know. I don’t know if we’ll ever know.” Instead of the courthouse, Vicky and Casey White were said to have driven her patrol car to a nearby shopping mall. There, they jumped into the Ford Edge SUV that she had bought days earlier using a fake identity, and took off running. “This escape was obviously well-planned and calculated,” Singleton said. “A lot of preparation went into this. They had plenty of resources, had cash, had vehicles. Had everything they needed to pull this off.” Investigators concluded shortly after the inmate and guard’s initial disappearance that the two had had a “special relationship.” Inmates reported that Vicky White had given Casey White his trays laden with “extra food,” Singleton said last week. “He was getting special privileges,” the sheriff told WAAY 31. “She was doing special things for him that other inmates didn’t get. That he was getting treated special.” There was no immediate evidence suggesting that anyone else had been involved in the escape, according to authorities. Casey White, a hulking 6-foot-9 inmate decorated with white supremacist tattoos, was serving 75 years for a 2015 “crime spree” that included, but was not limited to, a home invasion, carjacking, killing a dog, and attempting to kill an ex-girlfriend. In September 2020, he was charged with capital murder over the “brutal” stabbing of a 58-year-old woman, the U.S. Marshals Service said. Shortly after the indictment, he had been moved to the Lauderdale County jail to await trial for the woman’s murder. During his pre-sentencing proceedings in 2015, Casey White allegedly threatened to kill the ex-girlfriend, as well as his sister, if he ever escaped from jail, the Marshals Service said last Wednesday. The inmate also said “that he wanted police to kill him,” according to the agency. Investigators had taken “appropriate protective actions” to ensure the two women’s safety while Casey White was on the run, the agency said in a statement. Read more at The Daily Beast.

5/10/2022,"Russian soldiers booby-trapped a Ukrainian man's dead body in his own car trunk, according to Politico. His wife discovered his body and later brought Ukrainian troops to help move him, fearing a trap. When they tried to pull him from the trunk with a rope, the car ""exploded in a ball of flames."" Russian soldiers killed a Ukrainian army volunteer on the outskirts of Kyiv and left his dead body in his car trunk fitted with a mine that later exploded when Ukrainian forces attempted to move him, according to Politico. Lyudmyla Kyrpach, the soldier's widow, told Politico that she and her husband Oleksandr ""did everything together."" Kyrpach told the outlet that the day after the invasion began in late February, Oleksandr, a mechanic, organized volunteer fighters in his village of Kalynivka, near Kyiv. By March 1, days after Russian troops had encroached on their village, Oleksandr's friends set out driving to see if they could source more intel about Russian troop movements up close. She told Politico's Christopher Miller that after they failed to return, he set out to find them. ""He said he would be right back,"" Lyudmyla told Politico. Oleksandr never returned, and unable to sleep, Lyudmyla set out the following day with her friends to find him. She noticed his sedan on the road, with the keys in the ignition but no passengers in the car, she told Politico. Lyudmyla's friend noticed that the trunk was riddled with bullets, per the report, and they opened the trunk to find Oleksandr's dead body. Her friend pulled her away from the car in fear that the trunk could be booby-trapped, she explained to the outlet. By March 4 they returned to the scene with Ukrainian soldiers. According to the report, the soldiers tied ropes to his limbs and moved far from the car to pull slowly and see if the car was rigged. As soon as they pulled, the ""car exploded in a ball of flames."" Russian soldiers had placed weight-triggered mine under Oleksandr, Lyudmyla told Politico. ""Lyudmyla picked up the pieces of the man she had spent decades with and placed them in a box,"" Politico reported. Later, she buried him in the garden where they used to plant vegetables together. In April, the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had stated that Russia's attacks on civilians extended beyond artillery attacks, with officials saying they uncovered booby traps scattered throughout cities including Kyiv and Mariupol. ""The Russian Federation is in war not only with the Ukrainian Armed Forces but also fights against the civilian population of Ukraine, grossly violating the Law of war,"" the statement said.""While retreating Russia's military personnel is massively setting up booby-traps, banned by the international law, even on food facilities, private housing, and human corpses."" Last month, Ukrainian authorities unearthed a mass grave in Bucha, near Kyiv, claiming that Russian soldiers killed and buried at least 360 Ukrainians in a 45-foot-long trench. Journalists who visited Bucha after Russian troops pulled out also reported bodies of civilians in their homes, on the street, and in the suburb's glass factory.

How to qualify for the student loan tax offset hardship refund “Vacation pro tip: Avoid the pool with the swim-up bar,” TikTok user @twofoodpiggies advised in the video. “There were literally intoxicated guests admitting that they were peeing in the pool here.” The video shows people hanging out at the swim-up bar at a resort in Cabo, Mexico, according to the tags included on TikTok. “One girl didn’t understand why some people were leaving the pool to use the washroom,” @twofoodpiggies alleged in the video’s caption. This Brooklyn home office gets a California-inspired makeover with just $1,000: In 2019, the CDC even issued a plea for people to stop peeing in pools after the Sachs Media Group conducted an online survey that found out that 40% of the 3,100 Americans interviewed admitted to peeing in pools. Pools are filled with chlorine to protect swimmers from germs and outbreaks. When someone pees in the pool, it decreases chlorine’s effectiveness and can contribute to skin irritation and respiratory symptoms. Over 2,000 people chimed in on @twofoodpiggies’s video — with some identifying as former competitive swimmers or water polo players and claiming this wasn’t that gross to them. “As a collegiate swimmer, I promise we all peed in the pool every day,” one person said. “I don’t even go in the swim-up pool [I] just watch how long some people stay in the water,” another added. “They all do [it].” “The amount of people admitting peeing in a pool in this comment section disgusts me,” a top comment says.

5/10/2022,"A 91-year-old Korean War Navy veteran is hoping to find his first love, who he met during his time as a second class petty officer in Japan in 1953.

Duane Mann, 91, wrote a Facebook post on May 1 hoping to find someone who recognizes the woman in a photo he took in 1953, whose name he says is Peggy Yamaguchi. In the post, Mann explains that while he was stationed in Japan from 1953 to 1954 at age 23, he met Yamaguchi at an Air Force NCO Club, where he worked as a slot machine repairman in his spare time and Yamaguchi worked as the “hat check girl.”

 

Mann recalls spending “a lot of time dancing together,” leading the two to fall in love and begin a relationship less than six months after meeting each other.

The couple planned to get married within three months; however, Mann was discharged two months early and sent back to the U.S. The 91-year-old says he had no choice but to leave her behind and that she was also pregnant at the time.

After returning home to Iowa in 1954, Mann discovered that his father had spent all of his savings, which he had planned to use to bring Yamaguchi to the U.S. Mann and Yamaguchi exchanged letters each week until, he says, he stopped receiving them after about a month.

Three months later, Mann received a letter from Yamaguchi stating that she had lost the baby and was married to an Air Force man from Wisconsin.

He also discovered that his mother had been burning Yamaguchi’s letters “because she didn’t want [him] to marry a Japanese girl.” He recalled feeling “devastated and deeply confused” at that moment and was “completely destroyed.”

“I don't know why I didn't become violently angry as I was so completely distroyed [sic] at the moment. So, I have spent the [last] 70 years trying to find Peggy because the most haunting thing of all is that she must have figured that I ABANDED [sic] HER!! I have never been able to shed this thought and have lived now to the age of 91 and carry a very heavy heart because of what all happened,” Mann wrote.

Mann added that he does not know Yamaguchi’s Japanese first name or her possible husband’s name and is hoping that someone who finds his Facebook post will recognize Yamaguchi.

""I AM HOPING, WITH ALL MY HEART, that this last posting can be SHARED to the extent that I may reach Peggy or a member of her family,"" he writes in his post.

5/10/2022,"The West has hit Russia with a range of economic sanctions including a promise this weekend from the G-7 nations to reduce their dependence on the country's oil. But one type of sanction, so-called ""export controls,"" has attracted less attention than other high-profile penalties like seizing oligarchs' yachts. Export controls ban companies from sending crucial products like semiconductors to Russia with the goal of gradually starving its economy. But a top Biden administration official told Yahoo Finance on Monday that certain export controls may hurt Vladimir Putin’s army in the immediate future. “Because of the export controls we’ve already put in place, Russia’s top two manufacturers of tanks are no longer in business,” Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo said Monday. “Russia today has far fewer tanks than they had going into this invasion, and they can't make more because of the action that we're taking with sanctions.” The White House says the controls have left Russia’s two major tank plants — the Uralvagonzavod Corporation and Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant — idle due to a lack of foreign components. And observers noticed fewer tanks than normal at the annual military parade on Moscow’s Red Square on Monday. Meanwhile, images of destroyed Russian tanks felled by U.S.-made Javelin missiles have become a rallying cry for Ukrainians and their allies. On Sunday, the White House announced additional export controls on items like wood products, industrial engines, bulldozers, and more to “further limit Russia’s access to items and revenue that could support its military capabilities.” The EU moved in tandem with new controls on items like chemicals. A senior administration official told reporters over the weekend that export control efforts had begun on specialized products like microchips and now “we’re broadening into industrial products that have a similar effect, we think, on Putin’s ability to prosecute his war ambitions.” As Adeyemo told Yahoo Finance on Monday, the goal is to ""reduce the resources to Russia in order to make sure they have less resources to fight their war on Ukraine."" The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) as laid out in U.S. government documents apply not just to items produced in the U.S. but also claims “foreign-produced items located outside the United States are subject to the EAR when they are a ‘direct product’ of” industries like U.S. technology, software, or manufacturing."" The moves on export controls come as part of a host of new actions against Russia announced Sunday, including sanctions against Russian individuals and businesses and an attempt by G7 nations to stop importing Russian oil. The U.S. Commerce Department also said Monday that the U.S. would temporarily suspend tariffs on Ukrainian steel for one year.

5/10/2022,"When going through TSA, taking large electronics out and packing liquids less than 3.4 fl. oz. is the norm. However, that norm may soon be a thing of the past, thanks to the future of airport technology. Ireland’s Shannon Airport implemented its new CT scanning security system in October 2021. This new technology allows liquids to have no restrictions on volume. Shannon Airport is not new to being a pioneer in the travel industry. In 1947, the airport opened the world’s first Duty-Free shop. In 2009, Shannon Airport became the first airport in the world to provide full US pre-clearance facilities. Donegal Airport, also located in Ireland, has installed the new technology, which costs around $2.6 million. The CT scans are similar to the ones used in hospitals. Airports will replace 2D scans with 3D imaging. Kevin Riordan, head of checkpoint solutions at Smiths Detection tells CNN Travel, “From a security point of view, they’re able to make very accurate decisions about what the materials are in your bag: Is it a likely threat material or is it benign. That’s better security, better decisions.” New technology means less time for travelers in airport security lines. The liquid ban came into play in August 2006, when a terrorist plot to detonate liquid explosives on multiple air crafts was stopped. Before the liquid ban, airport security lines moved more quickly.

Every year, Russia marks the occasion with a grand military parade in Moscow's Red Square. This year, Russian President Vladimir Putin's Victory Day speech passed without a single direct mention of Ukraine or a declaration of all-out war, despite Western officials' warnings that Putin may escalate the conflict around the holiday. In his speech, Putin ripped NATO expansion, accused the US of aggression, and called Ukraine and its leaders Nazis — claims he previously used to justify the Russian invasion of Ukraine. When Putin announced his invasion of Ukraine, he said he was seeking the ""denazification"" of Ukraine, a country whose democratically elected leader, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is Jewish. ""The West was preparing for the invasion of Russia. NATO was creating tensions at the borders. They did not want to listen to Russia. They had other plans,"" Putin said in his Victory Day speech. ""You are fighting for the motherland, for its future, so that no one forgets the lessons of World War II, so that there is no place in the world for executioners, punishers, and Nazis."" Russia launched its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine on February 24 and the war has since left thousands dead on both sides, including many Ukrainian civilians.

5/10/2022,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Russia's ambassador to Poland was splattered with red paint thrown at him by protesters opposed to the war in Ukraine, preventing him from paying respects on Monday at a Warsaw cemetery to Red Army soldiers who died during World War II. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova denounced the attack, saying that “we won’t be scared” while the “people of Europe should be scared to see their reflection in a mirror.” Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau described the incident as “highly deplorable.” “Diplomats enjoy special protection, regardless of the policies pursued by the governments that they represent,” he said. Ambassador Sergey Andreev arrived at the Soviet soldiers' cemetery to lay flowers on Victory Day, which marks the defeat of Nazi Germany by the Allies. The major Russian patriotic holiday was celebrated with pomp in a parade at Red Square in Moscow. As he arrived at the Soviet Military Cemetery in the Polish capital, Andreev was met by hundreds of activists opposed to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Red paint was thrown from behind at him before a protester standing beside him threw a big blob of it in his face. The protesters carried Ukrainian flags and chanted ""fascists” and “murderers"" at him, in Russian, while some were dressed in white sheets smeared with red, symbolizing the Ukrainian victims of Russia’s war. Other people in his entourage were also seen splattered with what appeared to be red paint. Zakharova said that “admirers of the neo-Nazis have once again shown their face.” She said that along with the removal of monuments to Soviet army World War II heroes, the attack reflected the “course for the reincarnation of fascism.” Some Russian commentators suggested that the attack on the ambassador could prompt Moscow to recall him and ask the Polish ambassador to leave Russia. The Polish government faced some criticism for not providing the ambassador with more security, allowing for an incident to occur that Russia could use to depict Poland as hostile to Moscow. Among the critics was a former interior minister, Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz, who said he couldn't understand why there wasn't more protection for the ambassador when for weeks “you could feel how May 9 could end in Warsaw.” Poland’s current interior minister, however, said Poland’s government opposed the ambassador against laying a wreath at the cemetery, and noted that police helped him to safely leave the scene. The ambassador had originally hoped to hold a Victory Day march in Warsaw, but national and city authorities opposed that — and some viewed his appearance at the cemetery as provocative. “The gathering of opponents of Russian aggression against Ukraine, where the crime of genocide takes place every day, was legal,” Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski added. “The emotions of Ukrainian women taking part in the demonstration, whose husbands are fighting bravely in defense of their homeland, are understandable.” Protesters also marched in Warsaw on Sunday evening to protest the war, bringing a tank on a tractor and parking it in front of the Russian Embassy. Since the war began on Feb. 24, images of Ukrainian tractors hauling off Russian tanks have been symbols of Ukrainian resistance. The Soviet cemetery is set amid a vast park on the route linking the downtown to the international airport. It is the final resting place of more than 20,000 Red Army soldiers who perished on Polish soil fighting while helping to defeat Nazi Germany. While Poland has removed some monuments to the Red Army in the decades since it threw off Moscow-backed communist rule, it has allowed the cemetery to remain undisturbed. Though Soviet soldiers defeated the Nazis, earlier in the war the Soviet forces had invaded Poland following a secret agreement with the German Nazi government, and carried out atrocities against Poles, including mass executions and deportations to Siberia. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,Russian envoy to Poland hit with red paint at war cemetery,https://news.yahoo.com/russian-ambassador-poland-hit-red-104938503.html

The pup is now rehabilitating at the center before being introduced to a foster sibling. A Massachusetts family accidentally brought home a young coyote they confused for a lost puppy, according to the New England Wildlife Center. In a Tuesday Facebook post, the non-profit organization shared a photo of the Eastern coyote pup and described how he was found ""wandering and distressed"" on the side of a busy road. Once the family realized the coyote was not a dog, they reached out to the New England Wildlife Center Cape Branch for help. The organization said it worked with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to determine there was no exposure risk for rabies. A representative for the New England Wildlife Center confirmed with Insider that the Cape Branch received the coyote pup on April 23, and also shared the pup will be rehabilitated at the organization's facility in Barnstable, Massachusetts. According to the Facebook post, he is ""recovering comfortably"" in an isolation ward. The representative also confirmed that a foster sibling for the pup recently arrived from the Wildlife Clinic of Rhode Island. The Facebook post said the two pups will be raised together in a large outdoor caging once they both receive their vaccinations. ""We work hard to give them as much of a natural upbringing as possible, and will work to replicate the essential behaviors and skills they learn from mom and dad,"" the post reads. The Wildlife Clinic of Rhode Island did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. The New England Wildlife Center's Facebook post noted that although everything worked out for the young pup, the situation could have been a lot different if he had rabies. According to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, coyotes are either known as rabies vectors or are considered likely to have the potential to transmit rabies. The wildlife center wrote that if the finders had been scratched, bitten, or had extended contact with the coyote, the pup would have been euthanized and tested for the disease. ""We are grateful to every single person who takes time out of their day to help wildlife when they are [in] need, but we always encourage people to call the appropriate resources prior to intervening,"" the post concluded.

5/10/2022,"Despite the Federal Reserve's increasingly hawkish stance, inflation continues to be a problem. In March, U.S. consumer prices rose 8.5% from a year ago, marking the biggest jump since 1981. Inflation erodes purchasing power. According to Shark Tank star and investment mogul Kevin O’Leary, that means keeping large sums of money in a low-interest savings account is a big mistake. “Right now in a bank account, you’re getting very little [interest],” he says in a recent interview with CNBC. “And inflation is over 6%. So you’re actually losing money every 12 months.” O’Leary suggests having three months of salary on hand in case of emergency. But after you've built that cushion, O’Leary recommends investing in index funds, which offer an easy and diversified way to get exposure to the stock market. Here’s a look at three index funds. Each of them focuses on different chunks of the market — own all three and you’re well diversified. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. The S&P 500 Index is widely regarded as the benchmark index for the U.S. stock market. Several funds track the S&P 500 in order to provide investors with convenient exposure to U.S. equities. But if a fund wants to use the S&P 500 name, it has to pay a licensing fee that essentially gets passed on to investors. The Fidelity ZERO Large Cap Index Fund closely mirrors the performance of the S&P 500. But it’s not an “official” S&P 500 copycat, so it doesn’t have to pay the licensing fee. In turn, FNILX boasts an expense ratio of 0%. Every dollar you put into FNILX gets put to work. Small-cap stocks don’t get as much attention as their large-cap counterparts. But investors shouldn't ignore them. The largest companies we see today were once small. Companies with plenty of room to grow have tremendous upside. For a low-cost way to invest in this growth-oriented group, investors can check out Vanguard Small-Cap ETF. It tracks the CRSP U.S. Small Cap Index, which measures companies in the bottom 2%-15% of the investable universe. VB is diversified, holding around 1,550 stocks. It also has a low expense ratio of just 0.05%. One thing to keep in mind: Because small-cap stocks are relatively young, they tend to be more volatile than more established large-cap names. To truly diversify your portfolio — especially in this age of globalization — having some exposure outside of the U.S. is essential. Thankfully, it’s easy these days to invest overseas. For instance, Vanguard Total International Stock ETF seeks to match the performance of the FTSE Global All Cap ex-US Index. By owning this index fund, investors get broad exposure across developed, as well as emerging non-U.S. equity markets. The fund’s top holdings include global industry titans such as Samsung Electronics, Nestle, Tencent Holdings and Toyota. It also owns smaller names and holds over 7,800 stocks, with an expense ratio of 0.07%. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms.

5/10/2022,"(Reuters) -Following are quotes from a televised speech on Monday by President Vladimir Putin at Moscow's annual Victory Day parade on Red Square, translated from Russian to English by Reuters: ON SECURITY GUARANTEES DEMANDED BY PUTIN ""Despite disagreements in international relations, Russia has always advocated the creation of a system of equal and indivisible security, a system that is vital for the entire international community. ""In December last year, we proposed the conclusion of an agreement on security guarantees. Russia called on the West to enter an honest dialogue, in search of reasonable compromise solutions, to take each other’s interests into account. It was all in vain."" ""NATO countries did not want to listen to us, meaning that they in fact had entirely different plans, and we saw this. Openly, preparations were under way for another punitive operation in Donbas, the invasion of our historical lands, including Crimea. ""In Kyiv, they announced the possible acquisition of nuclear weapons, the NATO bloc began actively taking military control of territories adjacent to ours. As such, an absolutely unacceptable threat to us was systematically created, and moreover directly on our borders. ""Everything indicated that a clash with the neo-Nazis, the Banderites [Ukrainian Nazi sympathisers], backed by the United States and their junior partners, was inevitable."" ON DECISION TO LAUNCH 'SPECIAL MILITARY OPERATION' ""We saw military infrastructure being ramped up, hundreds of military advisers working and regular deliveries of modern weapons from NATO. (The level of) danger was increasing every day. Russia preventively rebuffed the aggressor. It was necessary, timely and ... right. The decision of a sovereign, strong, independent country."" ON EASTERN UKRAINE ""Today, the volunteers of the Donbas, together with the soldiers of the Russian Army, are fighting on their own lands ... ""I am now addressing our Armed Forces and the Donbas volunteers. You are fighting for the Motherland, for its future, so that no one forgets the lessons of the Second World War. So that there is no place in the world for executioners, punishers and Nazis."" ON MILITARY LOSSES ""The death of each one of our soldiers and officers is our shared grief and an irreparable loss for their friends and relatives. The state, regions, companies and public organisations will do everything to care for and help these families. We will give special support to the children of dead and wounded comrades. A Presidential Decree on this was signed today."" ON RUSSIA AND THE WEST ""The United States, especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union, began talking about its exclusivity, abasing not only the whole world but also its satellites, which have to pretend that they don't see anything and obediently swallow it up. But we are a different country. Russia has a different character. We will never abandon our love for the Motherland, our faith and traditional values, the customs of our ancestors and our respect for all peoples and cultures.""

5/10/2022,"Brandon Newman, 24, shares his weight loss and body transformation journey with Men's Health.
 Ever since I was a kid, I've had an obsession with fitness: it has always been the light that has kept me on the straight and narrow. I've had many dark moments in my life, from being depressed and addicted to various substances, to nearly taking my own life in 2020. I was also diagnosed with IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) after I left the British Army, which resulted in medications that affected my bone health, and anti-inflammatory steroids with horrendous side effects including severe acne. At the time everything seemed pointless. This went on for many years until finally I found a medication that keeps it under control and gave me my life back. I think experiencing these hardships has ultimately given me the greatest perspective on how short life is, and over the last two years in particular, I've been making some big changes in my personal fitness. I've always been a ""follow the science"" kind of guy and looked at what is working for those who lead the industry. So for many years I had a push-pull-legs workout split and used to smash six days a week in the gym, however I ultimately found that was too much from both a mental and physical recovery standpoint. I started doing full-body workouts instead and ended up loving it, since I hate dedicated leg days. Video: The perfect core workout for ripped abs I've tried lots of different diets throughout the years—paleo, low carb, intermittent fasting—but again, what I've realized works for me is the IFFYM (""if it fits your macros"") approach. I also use a spreadsheet that calculates weekly weight gain/loss and calories that I enter each day. The best diet is one that you can put up with and enjoy for the rest of your life. I've never worked with a trainer, everything I've learned is self-taught from calorie counting to exercise routines. There is so much free information out there that essentially means you don't ever need a trainer. I got fit simply the way every other person gets fit; consistency and just making good behaviour choices that reward you in the long term. A good workout program with progressive overload, and tracking my calories and macros. The most difficult part of this journey for me was right at the beginning, when I decided I didn't want to look like that anymore, and I realized I had to start being responsible for the choices I made every day. That's hard because you know how easy it is to go home, relax, and choose the short term buzz over your long term wellbeing. So those initially weeks where you have to start saying no to the things that were your feelgood habits is the hardest. The brain becomes a rebellious child. But if someone asked me was it worth it, I can say without a doubt, yes! When you start doing right by yourself for long enough, you having a buzz that just can't be recreated with drugs or short term eating. I now feel the enjoyment of food to its fullest because it's balanced. I lost a total of 32 pounds, dropping from 195 to 162. For me, the biggest difference I noticed in my transformation was in my face: I keep being told how different I look now. Although, of course, noticing a bicep vein is a nice touch as well. Aside from the physical results, I also have more confidence, feel like I'm better at my job, and overall have a stronger sense of discipline and self-worth. I'm nowhere near finished, either. I'm currently in a cut phase while getting ready for a trip to Ibiza, as I'd like to be leaner for that. Then, when I've proven to myself that I can do it and I'm feeling confident enough, I'd really like to start a YouTube channel and some fitness-related social media, so I can help other people do the same. My advice for anyone who is starting out where I was, is to try to put yourself in the best position to make the changes you want. If you hang around pubs and nightclubs every Friday and Saturday but want to be something else, you need to start by putting yourself in the right environment. Everything becomes easier when you don't have to constantly say no to things. You start when you decide you want something different for your life. Do what you need to do for yourself first. You can't help or love others until you love or help yourself.

Source: Samoilenko during a briefing from Azovstal Samoilenko's Quote: One could run away like a coward, think only of one's own life, but not think about one's own duty, the oath that one took upon oneself. This is exactly what happened to the commander of the Marines of the 36th Brigade. He simply refused to carry out the order that was issued to him. And he tried to flee the city with a small group of working tanks, armoured combat vehicles, [and] ammunition… ... here (from Mariupol - ed.) it is impossible to break through, but if you think only about your own life, you will grab every opportunity to prolong this life. It's a big shame."" Details: Samoilenko noted that the Azov Regiment is now more than 100 kilometres from the original positions. Denys Prokopenko, commander of the Azov regiment, also spoke about this in an interview with Ukrayinska Pravda. Prokopenko's Quote: ""Then, unexpectedly, [​​Volodymyr Baraniuk], the commander of the 36th Brigade decided, without warning anyone, to simply make a breakthrough in an unknown direction and thereby lost many people. Also, many people were left to their fate, and they were simply captured. If this had not happened, with this brigade we would have been able to keep the defence on the right bank for a long time, but the flank was exposed, and after the completion of the clearing of the Ilyich plant, the enemy threw all their forces in our direction - this allowed them to attack us from the flank and rear.""

5/10/2022,"By Andrew Hay TAOS, N.M. (Reuters) -Firefighters in New Mexico begged holdout residents of a mountain village to evacuate on Sunday, before the United States' largest active wildfire races up a valley that is their only way out. Many have ignored requests to leave as they stayed on to defend centuries-old homes and ranches in Chacon, the village about 45 miles (72 km) northeast of Santa Fe, with a population of around 200. As the fire rapidly burned through forest 8 miles (13 km) away, firefighters and police warned people they would not be able to see or breathe once the blaze was upon them. ""It's coming, and it's coming fast,"" Dave Bales, the incident commander, told a briefing, adding that a lot of residents remained in Chacon and another threatened village, Guadalupita. About 12,000 households in northern New Mexico have been told to flee the second-largest wildfire in state history, which began in part after a burn prescribed by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) raged out of control on April 6. ""With winds like this, this fire can burn another 50,000 acres,"" William Sandoval, one of those who left Chacon, said from an evacuation center in the nearby town of Peñasco. The fire is advancing through forest packed with fuel after a century of USFS policy to douse blazes within hours and court-ordered bans on logging since the mid-1990s, said forest biologist Joshua Sloan at New Mexico Highlands University. Climate change has reduced snowpacks, leaving the area parched by its worst drought in at least five centuries, research on tree rings in the nearby Jemez Mountains shows. The so-called Hermits Peak Calf Canyon fire has consumed 176,273 acres (71,335 hectares), an area nearing the size of all five boroughs of New York City, and is 21 percent contained.

5/10/2022,"Sen. Ted Cruz expressed public relief that US citizen Trevor Reed was released from Russian prison. Reed's father was not ""appreciative"" of Cruz's lack of action in helping to free his son. A family spokesperson told Insider Cruz could've used his influence to speak to former President Trump. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz ""didn't do anything"" to aide in former Marine Trevor Reed's release from Russian custody, according to Reed's father, Joey Reed. Trevor Reed was detained in Moscow in 2019 after being convicted of attacking Russian police. He reportedly suffered during his stay in a Russian prison, including getting a broken rib and catching COVID-19. He was released on April 27 as part of a prisoner exchange between Russia and the US. Reed was swapped for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot sentenced for drug smuggling. ""He didn't do anything,"" Joey Reed said of Cruz in an interview with The Dallas Morning News. ""He's an embarrassment to the state of Texas, let me just say that. I don't care what or who runs against him, I will work for their campaign to defeat that son of a bitch."" Joey Reed was so dissatisfied with Cruz' actions surrounding his son that when Cruz called to congratulate them after publicly showing support for his son's release, the elder Reed said he asked ""where have you been for the last two and a half years?"" ""I hit him point-blank: 'We are not appreciative,'"" Reed told the News. ""They don't need celebratory tweets or phone calls,"" Jonathan Franks, a spokesperson for the Reeds told Insider. ""When their loved one has been released, they need tweets and phone calls when their loved ones are in jail."" Reed called Cruz asking for help years prior, but Cruz's staff said he couldn't speak out about their son's detainment publicly because the senator was an ""enemy of Putin,"" Reed said. Franks told Insider the call between the Reeds and Cruz's staff member was ""unfortunate"" and that the senator had not called to check in again until Trevor's release. Franks also emphasized that it was not a partisan attack — rather, the family wanted to emphasize that Cruz's outsized influence in the world of politics could have been beneficial to the family's fight. ""Particularly when Trump was president, it would've helped a lot if Ted Cruz had picked up the phone and called the President and said 'bring this kid home.""' Franks told Insider. ""We were almost there. Like he could have picked up the phone called Trump and told him to make a deal. "" Franks told Insider that he could not confirm if Cruz had made such an action privately without the family's knowledge. Cruz said he did not speak out partly because administration officials told him it could be ""counterproductive"" because he had been so against Russia's proposed Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, he told the News in a statement. Joey Reed told the News that Texas GOP Rep. Michael McCaul also publicly went against the Nord Stream and had still been a vocal advocate for Trevor's release.

5/10/2022,"A former corrections officer who was on the run for more than a week after authorities accused her of helping a capital murder suspect escape from an Alabama jail died Monday, authorities said. Hours after a police pursuit that ended in a crash in Indiana, Vicky White, 56, was pronounced dead, Vanderburgh County Coroner Steve Lockyear said. Murder suspect Casey White, 38, surrendered to authorities after the Ford F-150 he was driving wrecked, Rick Singleton, the sheriff of Lauderdale County in Alabama, told reporters earlier. Vicky White was pronounced dead at a hospital in Evansville, Indiana, shortly after 7 p.m. local time, Lockyear said. He didn’t say how she died. An autopsy is scheduled for Tuesday, Lockyear said. “This has ended a very long, stressful, challenging week and a half,” Singleton said. Casey White was taken into custody after he was seen on a security camera washing a Ford pickup in Evansville. The business owner provided authorities with security camera images, and the agency confirmed they showed White, the Marshals Service said. Officials have said he had a ""special relationship"" with White, the former assistant director of corrections at the Lauderdale County Jail. Authorities have said they had a relationship for at least two years and communicated over the phone. Additional details about their relationship have not been disclosed. Vicky White is believed to have helped Casey White escape on her final day at work. Vicky White was not seen in the photos from the car wash. It wasn’t immediately clear why they were in Evansville, roughly 270 miles north of the Lauderdale County Jail. A warrant for her arrest was issued this month alleging she facilitated or permitted Casey White's April 29 escape. Casey White was charged with two counts of capital murder in September 2020 in the stabbing of Connie Ridgeway, 58, and he was already in jail in connection with a 2015 home invasion, carjacking and police chase, according to the Marshals Service. Casey White confessed to stabbing Ridgeway and was awaiting trial at the Lauderdale County Jail when he disappeared, according to the agency.The Marshals Service said investigators have learned that before his sentencing in 2015, “he made threats against his ex-girlfriend and her sister, warning that if he ever got out, he would kill them and that he wanted police to kill him.” The Marshals Service was offering up to $10,000 for information leading to the capture of Casey White and an additional $5,000 for information leading to the capture of Vicky White. Officers realized the two were missing around 3:30 p.m. April 29, when Vicky White’s phone went straight to voicemail after repeated attempts to contact her, Singleton said. Vicky White and Casey White left the detention center, purportedly for a mental health evaluation in court. Investigators later confirmed that such an evaluation was never scheduled, Singleton said. At the time of her departure, Vicky White told the booking officer she planned to go to a medical appointment after she dropped off Casey White because she was not feeling well. But she had no appointment scheduled, Singleton said. She transported the suspect by herself — a violation of the policy requiring two sworn deputies to transport people under those charges, the sheriff said. Vicky White had talked about retiring for months. She had sold her house, and her last day of work as a Lauderdale County corrections officer was supposed to be April 29 — the day she and Casey White vanished.",U.S./NBC News,"Former corrections officer dead, murder suspect in custody after chase in Indiana ends in crash",https://news.yahoo.com/photos-show-alabama-fugitive-washing-215259782.html
5/10/2022,"SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria will not support European Union's new set of sanctions against Russia if the Balkan country does not get a derogation from the proposed ban on buying Russian oil, Deputy Prime Minister Assen Vassilev said late on Sunday. European Union governments moved closer on Sunday to agreeing to tough sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, but scheduled more talks for Monday to work out how to ensure countries most dependent on Russian energy can cope. ""The talks will continue tomorrow, on Tuesday too, a meeting of the leaders may be needed to conclude them. Our position is very clear. If there be a derogation for some of the countries, we want to get a derogation too,"" Vassilev told national BNT television. ""If not, we will not support the sanctions. But I do not expect to get to that, based on the talks at the moment,"" he said. Landlocked Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, which all depend heavily on Russian crude delivered via Soviet-era pipelines face a challenge to secure alternative sources and have asked for a derogation from the ban. Bulgaria has also requested a derogation. The European Commission proposed changes on Friday to its initial planned embargo on Russian oil to give the three countries more time to shift their energy supplies, while Bulgaria was not offered concessions, EU sources said. Vassilev said Bulgaria also needs to get a derogation, as its only refinery at the Black Sea port of Burgas needed time to upgrade its de-sulphurization facilities necessary to switch to processing only non-Russian crude. Neftochim Burgas refinery, owned by Russia's LUKOIL, is the dominant fuel provider in the Balkan country, the poorest in the 27-member bloc. At present, half of the oil it processes comes from Russia. Lack of an exemption would either pose serious environmental risks to the region of Burgas or force the oil refinery to decrease processing, which would create a deficit and further increase fuel prices, he said.

5/10/2022,"In his speech preceding the Victory Day celebrations across Russia on Sunday, President Vladimir Putin continued to promote the idea that his troops in Ukraine are fighting “to liberate their native land from the Nazi filth with confidence that, as in 1945, victory will be ours.” His portrayal of Ukrainians as Nazis rings so hollow that propagandists on state television have been struggling to justify the so-called “special military operation.” The description itself was meant to portray a nearly painless blitzkrieg, akin to the annexation of Crimea. Instead, it has turned into an ongoing bloody massacre and a slew of crippling sanctions. Russia was so unprepared for this turn of events, both militarily and economically, that even the most pro-Kremlin propagandists have been forced to acknowledge the grim reality of a pariah state fighting a war of aggression. During Friday’s broadcast of state TV show The Evening With Vladimir Solovyov, military analyst Konstantin Sivkov argued that Russia’s “current economic market system is unfit to meet the needs of our Armed Forces and of the entire country under these conditions.” Instead, he pushed for what he described as “military socialism,” a set of wartime rules and regulations that would move all strategic resources–including land and factories–under the direct control of the government to better fund the war. During the same show, host Vladimir Solovyov griped that Russia couldn’t compete with Ukraine’s seemingly endless supply of Turkish-made Bayraktar drones, which have been wreaking havoc on Russia’s troops and equipment. “They tell us from the frontlines: ‘Give us drones!’ People are crowdfunding crazy amounts of money. They bought up everything that was available in stores. Why can’t that junk be mass-produced in Russia?,” Solovyov fumed. State Duma member Semyon Bagdasarov chimed in: “Everyone is ashamed to talk about this topic. Volunteers, like our mutual acquaintances... are buying it all and transporting it over there. It’s a crying shame!” Solovyov proceeded to angrily complain about the restrictions that complicate the delivery of such items to Russian troops in Ukraine, adding: “It’s easier to bring it in through the Ukrainian Customs in Lviv. They let in any weapons.” Bagdasarov then resorted to blaming the West for the Kremlin’s humiliations, claiming that recent sanctions were designed to provoke a popular uprising, akin to the October revolution of 1917 or the 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt, also known as the August Coup. To prevent the potential riots, Bagdasarov suggested the need for “purges” of current “management officials.” He claimed that Russia is in sore need for a figure like Lavrentiy Beria—chief of the Soviet secret police who was notorious for his serial rapes and bloody mass executions. This attempts to whitewash odious figures of the past on Russian airwaves if nothing new., Shortly before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, host of Vesti Nedeli Dmitry Kiselyov praised the likes of Joseph Stalin, Lavrentiy Beria, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, among others for Russia’s nuclear capabilities. During Friday’s live broadcast of 60 Minutes, retired Colonel Mikhail Khodaryonok made the stunning confession that even mass mobilization in Russia wouldn’t help alter the course of Putin’s stalled invasion of Ukraine. He admitted that Russia would be hard-pressed to replenish its mounting losses in Ukraine, and that sending masses to fight with outdated weapons would be counterproductive because Russia’s arsenal does not measure up to NATO’s top-notch weaponry. “Let's imagine the drumroll, the sound of fanfare, and the mobilization is declared. How soon under this mobilization will we get the first fighter aviation regiment? We would get it by New Year's. We don't have the reserves, the pilots, or the planes so the mobilization would be of little help,” Khodaryonok said. “If tonight, we order new ships to be built, how soon will we get the first one? In two years! That's the deal with mobilization. If we set a goal of forming a new tank division, when would it be ready? I would say in at least 90 days. And it wouldn't be equipped with modern weaponry because we don't have modern weapons and equipment in our reserves.” Russians Caught in Bitchfest Over Putin’s ‘Bullshit’ Victory Day The retired colonel continued: “Sending people armed with weapons of yesteryear into a war of the 21st century to fight against global standard NATO weapons would not be the right thing to do. We need to replenish our losses, of course, but this should be done through industrial enterprises. Mobilization would not solve these issues."" In December of 2021, appearing on 60 Minutes, Khodaryonok flippantly said that Russia could destroy Ukraine in 11 minutes, but in the beginning of February—when Putin’s invasion seemed all but imminent—the colonel was much more clear-eyed. His sobering predictions, published in the newspaper Independent Military Observer, were remarkably accurate. Khodaryonok contradicted many popular analysts, stating in part that “To assert that no one in Ukraine will defend the regime means, in practice, complete ignorance of the military-political situation and the mood of the broad masses of people in the neighboring state. Moreover, the degree of hatred (which, as you know, is the most effective fuel for armed struggle) in the neighboring republic in relation to Moscow is frankly underestimated. No one will meet the Russian army with bread, salt and flowers in Ukraine.” Khodaryonok correctly predicted long and difficult battles, in addition to the extensive assistance the West would provide to Ukraine, writing in part: “There is no doubt that the United States and the countries of the North Atlantic Alliance will begin a kind of reincarnation of Lend-Lease, modeled after the Second World War.” Putin’s Stooges: He May Nuke Us All but We Are Ready to Die While open opposition to Putin’s war against Ukraine is outlawed, it’s clear that the Russian people are resisting in various unconventional ways. A series of fires have erupted at several military enlistment offices in recent days, as rumors of the impending mobilization unsettle potential conscripts. Putin’s propagandists have apparently been enlisted to convince the public that the outcome of Russia’s invasion is a matter of life and death for all of its citizens. State TV pundit Karen Shakhnazarov, who previously pleaded with Putin to end the war as soon as possible, returned to national broadcasts after a temporary absence with a drastically different narrative last week. During three separate broadcasts of The Evening With Vladimir Solovyov, Shakhnazarov claimed that Russians would find “no mercy” from their adversaries should the country lose the war. He threatened opponents of Putin’s invasion, predicting they would face a future of “concentration camps, re-education and mandatory sterilization” imposed as a “final solution” for the Russian people sought by Moscow’s enemies. While some Kremlin propagandists begrudgingly admit that Russia can’t afford to fight this war, the prevailing narrative force-fed by the state media is that Russia can’t afford to lose.

5/10/2022,"(In paragraph 21, corrects title of Sarah Guggenheimer from a Kelly Senate office spokesperson to a Kelly campaign spokesperson) By Tim Reid PHOENIX (Reuters) -Laura Wilson is a mother of three who lives in the sprawling suburbs of north Phoenix, a hotly contested electoral area of Arizona that could decide which party controls the U.S. Senate after November's congressional elections. Wilson, 61, is pro-choice, voted for Democratic President Joe Biden, and knew all about the news last week that the U.S. Supreme Court is likely poised to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision giving women the right to an abortion. Yet Wilson said she is undecided about who she will vote for this November, and abortion rights are not a priority for her. ""It's the economy and jobs,"" Wilson said. She said she was disappointed in Biden, because of high inflation and ""too many homeless people on the streets."" Wilson was one of 21 women interviewed by Reuters in the northern suburbs of Phoenix - a key area for Democratic Senator Mark Kelly's efforts to hold onto his seat - after news of the Supreme Court draft ruling broke. Most of the women said inflation, not abortion, was the galvanizing issue for them. Significantly, the interviewees were from a key swing demographic group - suburban mothers - who are hotly sought after by both Democrats and Republicans in elections. The interviews, while not a large sample, provide a sobering reminder for Democrats that inflation - which has reached 40-year highs - remains the most pressing issue for most Americans, who are grappling with soaring food and fuel costs and have given Biden low marks in opinion polls for his economic policies. `MAJOR, MAJOR ISSUE` Democrats, who face stiff headwinds to keep their razor-thin majority in the U.S. Congress, seized on the bombshell leak of the draft majority opinion from the country's top court that said states should decide abortion access. Democrats said they hoped it would help to mobilize Democratic voters, especially women, in an election year where the party has struggled to counter the enthusiasm of Republicans, who are widely seen winning at least the House of Representatives and possibly the Senate. Arizona is one of a handful of toss-up Senate races this November that will decide control of the upper chamber now controlled by Democrats. It is one of more than 20 Republican-run states where there would be an almost immediate ban on many abortions if the Supreme Court decides to overturn the Roe decision. A ruling is expected in June. Maria Alvarez, 46, a mother and a realtor, said she is pro-choice, but ""I really don't have a strong opinion on it."" She wants politicians who will take care of pocketbook issues. She had just completed a grocery shop that cost her $400, twice what she used to pay a year ago. Of the 21 women interviewed by Reuters, five said they were pro-life and Republican, while 16 said they were pro-choice. Just two of the 16 said the issue was the top priority for them when voting this November, while half of the 16 were undecided about who to vote for in the Senate race because of concerns about the economy. The other half said they would likely vote Democrat. The women all live in the northern suburbs of Phoenix, a densely populated part of Maricopa County, Arizona’s biggest county. Those suburbs had leaned Republican but in recent election cycles have become more evenly split and are a target for both parties. Christy Johnson, 51, described herself as an independent voter. She voted for former Republican President Donald Trump in 2020 but has voted for Democrats. Abortion rights are important to her but inflation is a ""major, major issue"" for her, along with climate change. Sherica Bailey, 33, got tearful talking about her two abortions. She is now adamantly opposed to abortion and says she will vote Republican and for any candidate who is pro-life. ""I do support the overturn of Roe v. Wade. I had abortions during a very dark time in my life. I was naive and stupid,"" she said. Polls show most Americans support a woman's right to an abortion. A majority of Americans - roughly 70% - believe abortion should be legal in most cases, polls say. PARTIES MOBILIZE Democrats and Republicans are already mobilizing around the issue, sending out fund-raising emails and mailers, knocking on doors and making ads. Last week, the Arizona Democratic Party held a news conference outside the Arizona State Capitol, with a focus on Kelly's re-election bid and the threat to abortion rights from his Republican challengers. ""This fall it is absolutely critical that we elect pro-choice candidates,"" said Rebecca Rios, the top Democrat in the Arizona Senate. Still, a spokesperson for Kelly's campaign appeared to acknowledge in a statement to Reuters that inflation remains the elephant in the room for most voters. ""Arizonans know they can count on Kelly to continue his work to protect access to abortion, lower costs for hardworking families, and get our economy back on track - at the same time,” spokesperson Sarah Guggenheimer said. Kelly will discover his opponent after a Republican primary vote on Aug. 2. One challenger, Blake Masters, told Reuters: ""Progressive activists were hoping they could gin up some abortionist outrage, but that has backfired."" Two other leading Republican Senate hopefuls, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, and businessman Jim Lamon - both abortion opponents - did not respond to a request for comment. Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, said it was not clear the abortion issue will be a game changer for Democrats this November. ""The biggest issue is still inflation and the economy,"" he said.
