2/3/2022,"Melinda French Gates, co-founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, will no longer be pledging the majority of her wealth to the philanthropic organization. According to the Wall Street Journal, French Gates still plans to distribute much of her fortune across philanthropic endeavors, but largely outside of the Gates Foundation, which is one of the world’s largest.  “I recognize the absurdity of so much wealth being concentrated in the hands of one person, and I believe the only responsible thing to do with a fortune this size is to give it away – as thoughtfully and impactfully as possible,” French Gates wrote in a new letter. “The ultimate goal of any philanthropist should be to render the need for philanthropy obsolete,” the billionaire wrote. “It’s important to acknowledge that giving away money your family will never need is not an especially noble act. There’s no question in my mind that the real standard for generosity is set by the people who give even when it means going without. “That’s why, as part of this pledge, I commit to doing more than writing checks. I also commit my time, energy, and efforts to the work of fighting poverty and advancing equality – for women and girls and other marginalized groups – in the United States and around the world.” In 2010, French Gates and her then husband Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, launched The Giving Pledge, alongside billionaire investor Warren Buffett. The campaign encourages the world’s richest people to dedicate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes. At the time, the former couple revealed in a joint letter that they have “committed the vast majority of our assets” to the Gates Foundation in efforts to address preventable death from various diseases and “tear down other barriers to health and education”. However, since their divorce in 2021, French Gates and Gates have each penned individual letters detailing varying philanthropic commitments. In 2015, French Gates founded Pivotal Ventures, an investment and incubation company that seeks to advance social and professional progress for women and families across the US. In French Gates’ letter, she reiterated her commitment to giving away the vast majority of her wealth. “I think philanthropy is most effective when it prioritizes flexibility over ideology – and why in my work at the foundation and Pivotal Ventures I’ll continue to seek out new partners, ideas, and perspectives,” she wrote. In a separate letter published by Gates, the Microsoft co-founder emphasized his philanthropic commitments to the Gates Foundation: “The foundation is my top philanthropic priority, even as my giving in other areas has grown over the years.”",News/US news,Melinda French Gates to no longer give bulk of wealth to Gates Foundation,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/02/melinda-french-gates-wealth-gates-foundation
2/3/2022,"Raith Rovers’ women’s team are cutting ties with the club as the backlash against the signing of David Goodwillie intensified on Wednesday. The announcement that the Kirkcaldy club was signing the former Clyde striker – who was found by a civil court in 2017 to have raped a woman – prompted anger and disgust from supporters and a string of resignations of senior Raith officials.  After withdrawing her shirt sponsorship of the club, the bestselling crime novelist Val McDermid confirmed on Wednesday that she would fund new shirts for the women’s side, which will be printed without the Raith Rovers crest, as the team arrange to play their next fixture this Sunday away from Starks Park, at another ground in the town. A further statement released by the Rovers management on Tuesday evening, which insisted the signing was “a football-related decision”, further inflamed tensions. On Wednesday Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said: “What it effectively seemed to be saying was it didn’t matter how a man treated a woman, the only thing that mattered to them was whether he could score goals for the football club.” She added: “Football players are role models and football clubs have a responsibility to make sure they are positive role models for the wee boys and the wee girls who look up to them. This is a player who was found in a civil court, albeit on the balance of probabilities, to have raped a woman and as far as I’m aware has not shown any remorse or reflection for that. Raith Rovers really do have to reflect on the message that sends.” Goodwillie and his former Dundee United teammate David Robertson were sued for damages for rape by Denise Clair, who waived her right to anonymity, in a landmark case in 2017. The pair had not been prosecuted, but the civil court ruled they had raped Clair after meeting her on a night out in West Lothian in 2011, and she was awarded £100,000 in damages. They denied the allegation and appealed against the judgment but lost. Goodwillie, now 32, was fined £250 for punching a man in a Stirling nightclub in 2008, and four years later pleaded guilty to assaulting a man in Glasgow city centre. The former prime minister Gordon Brown, who along with McDermid is one of second-tier Rovers’ most prominent supporters, said he “could not support the signing” and hecondemned rape and violence against women. Another Raith supporter, Martin Glass, has set up a fundraising page for Rape Crisis Scotland, which has raised nearly £9,000.",Sport/Football,Women’s team cut ties with Raith Rovers over David Goodwillie signing,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/02/womens-team-cut-ties-with-raith-rovers-over-david-goodwillie-signing
2/3/2022,"The skipper of a speedboat involved in a crash in which a 15-year-old girl was killed has denied manslaughter in court. It is alleged that Michael Lawrence was driving the boat at the time of the incident in August 2020, in which Emily Lewis suffered fatal injuries when the vessel collided with a five-tonne navigation buoy.  Emily was on board the boat, Seadogz, with her mother, Nikki, father Simon, sister Amy, 19, and seven other passengers. Appearing at Southampton magistrates court, Lawrence, 54, pleaded not guilty to gross negligence manslaughter. Michael Howley, the owner of Seadogz Rib Charter Ltd, which ran the trip on Southampton Water, was charged with “failing to take all reasonable steps to secure the boat operated in a safe manner”. Howley, 51, from Hordlein Hampshire, faces an alternative charge of failing to take reasonable steps as director of the company. He gave no pleas but indicated he would be pleading not guilty to all charges. The district judge Anthony Callaway sent the case for trial at Winchester crown court and released the two defendants on unconditional bail until a hearing on 2 March. Emily’s family previously said in a statement released through Hampshire constabulary: “We are all in shock that our beautiful daughter and sister is no longer with us, and words just don’t seem available to express our deep sense of loss.” Stuart Parkes, the headteacher at Brookfield community school where Emily was a student, described her as “kind, compassionate” and a “bright, conscientious student”.",News/UK news,Skipper denies manslaughter over Southampton speedboat crash,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/02/skipper-michael-lawrence-denies-manslaughter-over-southampton-speedboat-crash-emily-lewis
2/3/2022,"Joe Biden will deploy more US troops in Germany, Poland, and Romania, as Russia continues to build up its forces around Ukraine, and after talks between Washington and Moscow failed to bring any breakthrough or easing of tensions. The deployment was due to be announced on Wednesday according to multiple reports citing Pentagon sources. Last week, 8,500 troops in the US, including airborne units, were put on heightened alert to be ready to deploy at short notice. US official said the troops would be part of a Nato Response Force (NRF) intended to bolster the alliance’s eastern flank, in the face of a potential Russian attack on Ukraine.  Nato have so far not taken the decision to activate the NRF, which would require the agreement of its 30 member states. Biden and the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, have made it clear that no Nato combat troops would be going into Ukraine, although there are a small number of military advisers there. The decision to deploy US troops follows an exchange of documents between the US, Nato and Russia setting out their respective positions on European security, and a series of phone calls between the US secretary of state, Tony Blinken, and the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. The US has suggested a number of areas for negotiation and possible confidence building measures but has insisted there can be no compromise over Ukraine’s right to join Nato. The alliance has also stated that is non-negotiable. Russia’s central demand is for guarantees that Nato will not expand further eastward. According to a leaked copy of the US and Nato proposals, the US is ready to negotiate on limiting deployments of missiles in Europe and combat troops in Ukraine, if Russia draws back its military and makes reciprocal commitments. Neither the US or Nato have confirmed the authenticity of the documents, which were published on Wednesday in the Spanish newspaper El Pais. Both the US and Nato had sought to keep their written proposals private in order to facilitate tense negotiations with Russia. The Ria Novosti state media outlet has reported the documents are authentic, citing a source in the Russian foreign ministry. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in the leak, which came the day after Vladimir Putin said the United States had ignored Russia’s key concerns in its response. While the leak may embarrass Washington, the documents show that the US position in public and private are similar: calling for de-escalation via negotiations on arms control and other largely technical issues, while warning of tough consequences in case Russia launches an invasion in Ukraine. The US and Nato proposals also avoided any discussion of Russia’s controversial demands of a Nato withdrawal from eastern Europe and a pledge never to consider Ukraine’s membership in the security alliance. “The United States is willing to discuss conditions-based reciprocal transparency measures and reciprocal commitments by both the United States and Russia to refrain from deploying offensive ground-launched missile systems and permanent forces with a combat mission in the territory of Ukraine,” the document read. “We will continue to consult with Ukraine on these discussions.” The document also suggested confidence-building measures on military exercises and arms control in Europe, as well as deconfliction efforts to avoid an accidental military clash. It also carried careful demands for the Russian side to draw down its forces near Ukraine. Russia has moved more than an estimated 125,000 troops within striking distance of the Ukrainian border, including nearly half of its available battalion tactical groups (BTGs) and support units. “Further Russian increases to force posture or further aggression against Ukraine will force the United States and our Allies to strengthen our defensive posture,” the document also read, adding that progress could only be achieved in an “environment of deescalation” regarding Russia’s military buildup near Ukraine. Russia is still preparing a formal response to the western proposals. But Vladimir Putin on Tuesday accused the US of ignoring Russia’s security proposals in his first public remarks on the crisis since December. In emotional remarks, he also suggested that the United States may be using Ukraine to try to goad Russia into a conflict with Nato. Putin said he hoped that negotiations would continue but admitted he did not know what form a final agreement could take. At the same time, Russia has continued its buildup along the Ukrainian border, including from Belarus and the annexed Crimean peninsula. A new investigation by the online Conflict Intelligence Team shows that Russian national guard units and possibly riot police have also been deploying to the border region. Those forces could be used to hold ground in case of a Russian attack, analysts have said. Anti-war voices in Russia have also grown bolder this week. In an open letter, a group of prominent Russian activists, academics, journalists, and other public figures accusing the Russian “Party of War” in the Kremlin of seeking a conflict in Ukraine. “We, the responsible citizens of Russia and patriots of our country, appeal to the political leadership in Russia and make an open and public challenge to the Party of War, that has formed within the authorities,” the appeal read. “We express the point of view of the part of Russian society that hates war and believes it a crime to even use the threat of war … in foreign policy rhetoric.” “Our position is extremely simple: Russia does not need a war with Ukraine and the West,” the letter said. More than 2,000 people have publicly signed the letter.",News/US news,Biden to deploy more US troops to eastern Europe as Russia builds forces around Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/02/us-troops-ukraine-russia-border-biden-latest
2/3/2022,"On 4 August 1944 Gestapo officer Karl Josef Silberbauer, together with three Dutch policemen, marched into a spice merchant’s on Amsterdam’s Prinsengracht and demanded: “Where are the Jews?” It was a piercing moment in 20th-century history, one that never becomes dulled by retelling. Within minutes Silberbauer and his accomplices had located a dummy bookshelf, behind which lay a secret suite of rooms where two families had been hiding for two years. Placed under arrest, these eight men and women were subsequently sent to concentration camps in the east from which only one, the business’s owner, Otto Frank, returned. We know all this because one of Frank’s first postwar acts was to publish the journal that his 15-year-old daughter had kept during their immuration. The Diary of Anne Frank became a canonical text, one of the few accounts we have of living through Hitler’s Final Solution in real time. And it is Anne’s face – peaky, clever, ferociously alive – that has become the emblem of all the evil unleashed by antisemitism in Europe’s terrible mid-century. Yet despite the story being so familiar, there is one detail that remains a mystery. Who tipped off the authorities that there were people hiding at the back of Prinsengracht 263?  That was the question Canadian author Rosemary Sullivan set out to answer in her account of the recent attempt by Dutch film-maker Thijs Bayens and journalist Pieter van Twisk to find this final puzzle piece. Using the methodology and tropes of a police procedural, Bayens and van Twisk assembled what they insist on calling a “cold case team”, headed by recently retired FBI agent Vince Pankoke. Among his 30 staff, Pankoke had criminologists, psychologists, archivists, forensic scientists and a much vaunted artificial intelligence whizz who built a database that stores thousands of data points – addresses, biographies, political affiliations – in ways designed to throw up new suspects. Since publication, the results of their work have been disputed, and the Dutch publisher, Ambo Anthos, has suspended a further print run pending investigation. A member of the team, meanwhile, defended the research, arguing it was “appropriately caveated”. Whatever the eventual verdict, it’s clear that Sullivan’s book struggles to find a form and style that serves her material. In particular she seems uncertain about how much prior knowledge she can assume in her readers, which means that two thirds of this book are spent rehashing the story of the Franks’ murder, and the postwar publication of Anne’s diary. Only once Sullivan moves on to actual “persons of interest” does the narrative begin to pick up, even though here again much of this information has long been in the public domain. Up first is Job Jansen, the estranged and paranoid husband of one of Otto’s employees, who is convinced that his Jewish wife is having an affair with Herr Frank. Then there is Nelly Voskuijl, a Nazi fraterniser whose sister is one of the office workers helping the Franks to hide. Or what about long-time suspect Willem van Maaren, the light-fingered warehouse manager who might perhaps have been after the bounty money of 7.5 guilders (£35 today)? Most chillingly of all, there is the notorious Anna van Dijk, who from 1943 begins to collaborate with the Germans by luring her fellow Jews into carefully laid traps. Van Dijk was hanged after the war for the sheer scale of her crimes, yet the evidence for her turning in the Franks simply isn’t there. In the end, though, the cold case team single out a prominent Jewish notary called Arnold van den Bergh, whom they speculate may have passed on the information to the Nazis as a way of keeping his own family out of the concentration camps. Blowback from historians has focused on the highly circumstantial evidence advanced for Van den Bergh’s “guilt”. Specifically they have questioned the claim that, as a member of Amsterdam’s Jewish Council, he would have known the addresses of the places where Jewish people were hiding. Regardless, what Sullivan does manage to do is assemble a compelling picture of what it was like to live in Amsterdam under Nazi occupation: here is a collection of increasingly isolated individuals, hungry, terrified and daily faced with impossible choices about whether to save themselves, their loved ones, or the nice family that lives next door. And it is this moral vacuum that follows in the wake of antisemitism, rather than any particular “perp”, that betrayed Anne Frank.",Arts/Books,The Betrayal of Anne Frank by Rosemary Sullivan review – who tipped off the Nazis?,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/02/the-betrayal-of-anne-frank-by-rosemary-sullivan-review-who-tipped-off-the-nazis
2/3/2022,"Charles Dickens’ Oliver Twist is being given a new spin in a star-studded BBC prequel to the Victorian novel which highlights the parallels between food poverty in the 19th century and now. Echoing the most famous line from Dickens’ 1838 classic – “Please sir, I want some more” – and Marcus Rashford’s campaign to reduce child hunger, the writers of forthcoming 10-part family adventure series Dodger say they “made a conscious effort” to put food poverty “to the fore” in their show based on the exploits of Dickens’ characters The Artful Dodger and crime-lord Fagin.  The spin-off also creates a backstory for Fagin, played by Christopher Eccleston, making him “more interesting, sympathetic and funny … like a Robin Hood character” than in previous screen versions and suggests he may have been the subject of an antisemitic attack, according to Dodger creators Rhys Thomas and Lucy Montgomery. The husband and wife team have also updated other characters for modern audiences. Montgomery said that Nancy, who is played by Saira Choudhry, is no longer the traditional big-hearted fallen “Cockney sparrow”, but for the first time on screen as a wily northern thief who manipulates Bill Sikes. As Tom Stoppard did with his play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, creating a new show around the back stories of characters from a classical work gives, as Montgomery put it “an opportunity to create something fresh and new”. But they also wanted Dodger to be a programme the “family can all sit down and watch” for their children’s generation, while highlighting, with the use of food banks escalating due to the pandemic, that many children who will watch the BBC show will understand Fagin’s orphan gang’s battle against poverty and hunger. Thomas said he can see the children in his area who are being hit by the cost of living crisis: “We wanted to make something that’s really inclusive that everyone watching can identify with. You’ve got the Malory Towers kids going off to a fancy school and that’s one life and that’s fine, but this is a different world where I think kids watching this today, it resonates with them.” He first came up with the concept after appearing in a school performance of Oliver Twist as a child and said “coming from a working class background I’m not saying we struggled for food every week but we didn’t have a lot of money”. Although the fast-paced Dodger does not condone the crimes the characters commit it does explain why they do them, as Thomas said: “The whole thing is survival, there’s no-one to rely on. As Fagin says, ‘If we don’t rob we can’t eat and if we can’t eat we’ll starve and we’ll die’. It’s a survival instinct; he’s not a greedy man who wants money in the way you’ve seen in the past.” Montgomery said that with no welfare state for Victorian children the “food bank was the local market and what could you nick?”. She compared some of the exploitation of children today to the manipulation of the orphans by Fagin, with “children being used … obviously it happens today with things like county lines; this is like the 1830s version of that.” Comedians and writers Thomas and Montgomery also appear in the show, along with stars who play real-life historical characters to help teach some history to audiences, including David Threlfall as the first Metropolitan chief of police, Sir Charles Rowan, and Sex Education’s Tanya Reynolds as Queen Victoria, along with newcomers such as Billy Jenkins as Dodger. The cast have also recorded some history lessons for the BBC’s website. The writers said they took Dodger to the BBC as they thought it chimed with the organisation’s mission to inform, educate and entertain. Despite the social issues raised the series is optimistic and funny, said Montgomery: “It’s children being clever and using their bravery and wit to get themselves out of problems.” Thomas added: “If Dickens was around I don’t know what he’d think of it; hopefully he’d like it and think it’s quite funny – it’s in the spirit of the writing.” Dodger begins on BBC iPlayer and CBBC on Sunday 6 February",Arts/Books,Oliver Twist given new spin in BBC prequel to Charles Dickens novel,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/02/oliver-twist-given-new-spin-in-bbc-prequel-to-charles-dickens-novel-dodger
2/3/2022,"Aiden is a pilgrim, a nomadic survivor who wanders the zombie wastelands of Dying Light 2, taking goods from one settlement to another like some sort of post-apocalyptic Deliveroo rider. The search for his long-lost sibling has led him to a sprawling city somewhere in Europe. Here, three warring tribes endlessly fight for resources, using a familiar combination of melee combat and unconvincing dialogue. You take on missions for various shouting sociopaths, all competing to either save the world or blow it up, or some unfeasible combination of the two. Sound familiar? If you’ve played a zombie game in the past decade, it certainly should. The various territories of the city are all teeming with the undead, and also side-quests. Everywhere you go there are hidden weapon caches, bandit camps and train stations to unlock for fast travel, and windmills that must be powered up to create safe houses – a game design trope instantly recognisable to anyone who’s played an open-world adventure since 2012’s Far Cry 3. Indeed, Dying Light 2 feels like a B-movie undead reskin of Far Cry or Assassin’s Creed – rather like Days Gone.  Where that game’s unique selling point was its swarms of AI monsters, Dying Light 2 has parkour. Aiden is much safer if he stays on the rooftops, leaping from building to building, using architectural features, ropes and ladders to maintain verticality. This was a hallmark of the first title, of course, and it’s just as well implemented here. It never feels quite as good as, say, Insomniac’s ludicrously instinctual Spider-Man, but navigating this intricate playground provides the game’s strongest moments. It is fun to stand atop a tenement block, surveying the ruined skyscrapers, bubbling chemical wastelands and devastated evacuation centres, working out how to cross distances without hitting street level. As you run, the air is always full of shouts and screams and the staccato drum roll of gunfire, making you feel like the city is full of little tragedies. Getting better at parkour makes navigating the environment a constantly evolving dexterity challenge. This is a graphically impressive, professionally constructed world that desperately wants to give you stuff to do. So it’s a pity that the narrative core of the experience is as dead as its stumbling zombie hordes. Structurally it adheres so slavishly to the hero’s journey concept that Joseph Campbell should really get a writing credit. Every time Aiden feels he’s closer to his sister, some other obstacle pops up – usually in the form of a fetch quest or raid delivered by one of many identikit ruthless survivors. Every encounter provides either a facilitator or a nemesis on the mythic quest flow chart. There are dozens of cinematic scenes containing loss, grief and betrayal, but they don’t hit. Nothing hits. There is nothing like the devastating, destructive obsession between Ellie and Abby, none of the subtle, poignant interdependence of Geralt and Yennefer or the multilayered friendship of Max and Chloe. The characters and story threads are all tattered stereotypes of apocalyptic lore: we get the deranged general cut off from military order, the libertarian dudebro flourishing amid the chaos, the would-be messiah who imagines a socialist utopia rising from the ashes. But all their depth is delivered in a barrage of backstory and expository dialogue that tells us all about societal and emotional collapse – but shows us almost nothing. There’s a reason why The Last of Us makes most of its flashbacks interactive: it immerses the player in the past. I finished the game less than an hour ago and I can’t remember most of the characters’ names, let alone what they were fighting over. The one exception is stealthy assassin Lawan, who brings charm, mystery and humour and really should have been the protagonist. In its quest to go bigger, to be vast, to be endless, Dying Light 2 forgets that size doesn’t matter when it comes to affecting entertainment. The tweets that came out of developer Techland in the run up to the release of the game are so telling in this respect. 500 hours of gameplay! More words than War and Peace! But it’s not the length of Tolstoy’s novel that makes it a classic. If all you want is a gigantic zombie-filled Skinner box crammed with loot and repetitive, incremental violence, Dying Light 2 absolutely works. Honestly, you’ll love it. You can explore and level up and get into fights using increasingly powerful weapons, and the interlocking compulsion loops do their job of settling you into that grind. But oh for a moment of genuine surprise, a truly memorable line of dialogue, a spark of mechanical invention. The best apocalyptic fiction works in the pauses between horrors; it shocks us with unexpected tenderness. This is why Cormac McCarthy’s The Road ends not with an image of a wrecked city, but with the memory of brook trout swimming in rivers that wound through mountain glens, “where all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery”. The pandemic has given a lot of us firsthand experience of how weird and intimate a global calamity can be. Dying Light 2 hums not with mystery but with lethargy. I think maybe I’m done with the end of the world.

2/3/2022,"Ghislaine Maxwell’s legal team has argued in court papers that the juror who might not have disclosed prior sexual abuse during the jury selection process “violated” her right to a fair trial. Maxwell’s attorneys have implored Alison Nathan, the judge, “to right a grievous wrong that deprived Ms Maxwell of a fundamental constitutional right – her right to be tried by a fair and impartial jury”. They are requesting a retrial.  Maxwell was convicted on 29 December of sex trafficking and related charges for facilitating the late financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of girls, some as young as 14. Epstein, a convicted sex offender, was arrested in July 2019 for sex trafficking underage teens; he killed himself in a Manhattan jail about one month later, while awaiting his own trial. The controversy over Juror 50, later identified as Scotty David, stems from post-trial interviews where he publicly claimed to have suffered sexual abuse as a child. David reportedly said that he told other jurors about this abuse – and helped his cohorts see things from a victim’s perspective. David’s comments prompted questions because potential jurors filled out questionnaires as part of the selection process – which directly asked about sexual abuse. One of the questions asked: “Have you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” David reportedly claimed that he did not remember the query on abuse but that he had responded to every question honestly. After David’s interviews, prosecutors asked Nathan to investigate his comments; shortly thereafter, Maxwell’s lawyers asked for a hearing on the issue. The new filing from Maxwell’s attorneys is part of their push to keep their detailed arguments for a new trial under seal, for the time being. Their argument for sealing itself was initially filed under wraps, but Nathan ruled on 26 January that it must be filed publicly. Maxwell’s lawyers argued that releasing their detailed arguments before Nathan makes a decision on retrial, or before a hearing on this issue concludes, “will provide a roadmap of the defense’s examination of Juror 50 and will allow him to plan out and tailor his responses, or even potentially spoliate evidence, to paint himself and his conduct in the best light possible”. “There is also a significant risk that the publicity that will undoubtedly surround the unsealing of the motion will influence the memories of other potential witnesses,” they said. “All of this will frustrate the truth-seeking process of any factual inquiry ordered by the court and jeopardize Ms Maxwell’s one chance to vindicate her right to a fair trial.” They claim that Maxwell “does not seek to seal the motion indefinitely” and “seeks only a temporary sealing to protect the integrity of any fact-finding process ordered by the court”. David’s lawyer said “no comment” when asked about the new filings. Maxwell’s trial has once again ramped up scrutiny of Prince Andrew. The Duke of York once counted Maxwell and Epstein as associates. Virginia Giuffre, a longtime Epstein accuser, filed suit against Andrew in Manhattan federal court. Giuffre claims that Epstein and Maxwell forced her into a sexual encounter with the royal some 20 years ago, when she was 17. She has alleged that Andrew engaged in sexual misconduct with her on other occasions. Andrew denies wrongdoing. The legal proceedings have proved disastrous for Andrew. Buckingham Palace remarked in a 13 January statement: “With the Queen’s approval and agreement, the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages have been returned to the Queen. The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen.”",News/US news,"Ghislaine Maxwell’s right to a fair trial was ‘violated’, lawyers argue",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/02/ghislaine-maxwell-lawyers-fair-trial-juror
2/3/2022,"The Aleutian Islands are fabled in surfing. Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, they’re a raw chain of islands connecting Alaska to Russia. The area is known as The Cradle of Storms because it’s so windy and wild. Most of the islands are made up of tundra and there are big active volcanoes. This island, Umnak, is home to a very small Aleut community. I went there in 2013. The planning alone took two years. You need to be completely self-sustained. You need to charter a small plane and have enough food and supplies for your entire stay, with the means to charge all your equipment.  The surfer in the picture is Josh Mulcoy, who I’ve spent the better part of my career travelling with. He’s known to many as the godfather of cold-water surfing, one of the pioneers of the sport. He’s on a right-hander, on a beautiful point break we found. The volcano in the background is Mount Vsevidof, the only volcano on this island. Of the 14 days we were there, this was the single clear morning. It was icy cold and below freezing. We had a 15 or 20 mile all-terrain-vehicle ride to get to the beach, and then, once you’re there, you’re susceptible to all the weather and conditions. We knew there was a new swell arriving but we had no idea it would be this clear or beautiful. We didn’t even know if Josh was going to be able to surf. But it turned out to be one of the best days of surfing I’ve ever seen. Many of my photos are taken from out in the water but I took this one on land. I was crouched below rocks on the shoreline, trying to compress the wave into the background. The photograph was a cover shot for Surfer magazine. It’s probably the most iconic image of my career, the one I’ve sold the most. There are few moments in your life as a photographer when you really recognise a great image when you take it – it’s hard to do that when you’re shooting. But this stood out right away. This single image tells the viewer exactly where we went, what we did, what it was like. When you see this, you don’t need to question whether it was cold or if the conditions were harsh – you know it. This is the whole story in one, giving equal weight and space to the athlete and the wave, as well as the landscape. I was born in Pismo Beach, California, and grew up surfing. It was part of my identity as a kid. I’ve always understood the ocean, but that doesn’t mean this kind of photography is easy. It’s incredibly challenging – and that’s part of why I love it. When I started shooting surfing professionally I went to a lot of beautiful places, locations where I was selling the art of adventure, but I wanted to go beyond the surf hotspots, the sunny beaches, and learn what else was out there. That’s why I started seeking out colder environments. I wanted to immerse myself in unique places, where I felt I was giving a bit more of myself to the process. I’ve worked in the Faroe Isles, northern Norway, and in the far east of Russia on the Kamchatka Peninsula and the Kuril islands – places where you have to be prepared for any kind of weather and conditions, where it can go from being sunny to snowy in a single day. These are places that ask more of you: creatively, physically, emotionally. That’s what draws me to them. My hope is that people looking at my photographs realise that to have true and meaningful experiences, you can’t just dream about finding yourself in remote places. You need to get out there. If you let them, these places can really change you. They can show you not only the beauty of the world, but a different part of yourself.

2/3/2022,"It was hard not to be charmed by Dave Ryding’s slalom victory at Kitzbühel. His story has a little of everything the British want in their favourite winter Olympians, an unlikely beginning on a dry ski slope in Pendle, a homespun background, training in a shed his father built in the back garden and a mulish stubborn streak that meant he graduated on to the elite skiing circuit when he was 28, the sort of age when most people would be thinking about quitting already, and that, at 35, made him the country’s first World Cup race winner. “Ein Brite? Ein Brite!” was the headline in the next day’s Süddeutsche Zeitung.  Ryding is 50-1 to win the slalom gold medal in Beijing. There is something enjoyably improbable about it all, even now he has already gone and won a race. Great Britain is one of a handful of countries who have been represented at all 23 Winter Olympic Games. They have won a grand total of 32 medals in them, in figure skating and curling, leisure‑centre sports that can be done indoors, plus skeleton and bobsled racing, a gold in ice hockey, believe it or not, back in 1936, and a smattering of bronzes in snowboarding, freestyle skiing and short‑track speed skating. In alpine skiing, Great Britain have won exactly nothing, nada, in almost a century of trying. They almost did when Ryding’s GB coach, Alain Baxter, finished third in the slalom at Salt Lake in 2002, a turn-up so unexpected that none of the band of British journalists covering those Games were there to see it happen because nobody figured he had a chance of winning anything. But it was stripped from him because he tested positive for a tiny quantity of methamphetamine he had inadvertently ingested after using a Vicks inhaler. Which, some felt, was such an injustice that a group of MPs tabled an early day motion in parliament calling on the International Olympic Committee to overturn the decision. The IOC did not. The really odd part of this story, though, is not Britain’s comparative lack of success in the sport (“I’m from the UK,” Ryding said recently, “and we don’t have mountains”) but that if it weren’t for the British the sport would not exist at all. The strange fact is that they invented modern alpine skiing a century ago. Which means it is yet another of those sports the British conceived, organised, formalised and spread, then spent the next 100 years losing at. Most of this can be traced back to the early days of Ryding’s own ski club, the Kandahar, and one man in particular, Sir Arnold Lunn. Lunn, born in 1898, was the son of Sir Henry Lunn, who founded a travel agency that organised the first winter tours from Britain to Switzerland (the company went out of business in 2005 but – “Lunn Poly, Get Away!” – is still instantly familiar to anyone who lived in Britain in the 1980s and 90s). Henry never skied but his boy, Arnold, took to it from the start. In those early days, that meant racing cross-country, Scandinavian style, with arduous treks uphill and long stretches of flat terrain broken up by short downhill descents when the racers braked with sticks. The idea was that a man who is fast downhill is still slower than a man who is fast uphill. The descents were for resting. There were slalom races, but the competitors were marked entirely on style and technique and they were for kids. Until Lunn and a band of British tourists set about reforming, organising and codifying the sport with the devil-may-care zeal and damned‑if‑I‑won’t self-certainty of Edwardian public school boys. They set up the first downhill race in the Alps, the Roberts of Kandahar Challenge Cup in 1903. Lunn went further and concocted an idea for a slalom with competitors judged on their time rather than technique. “The object of a turn is to get round a given obstacle losing as little speed as possible,” he wrote. “Therefore, a fast ugly turn is better than a slow pretty turn.” He organised his first slalom race, the Alpine Ski Challenge Cup, almost exactly a century ago, in January 1922. It was Lunn who set up the gates, staked out the course and devised the format. Over the next 10 years, he oversaw its growth, through the first championships and its eventual acceptance by the International Ski Federation (FIS) and inclusion in the Winter Olympics in 1936. The traditionalists did not always take kindly to his upstart efforts. He said it was like an American member of the MCC proposing they ought to play baseball on alternate Sundays. One Norwegian vice-president of the FIS asked him: “What would you think, Mr Lunn, if I tried to alter the rules of cricket?” Lunn replied “I wish you would. If you succeeded we might have fewer draws.” Lunn became a well-known, and occasionally controversial, thinker and theologian, but remained proud of his achievements in skiing. He wrote: “The group of Englishmen at Mürren responsible for what I have called ‘the Kandahar revolution’ had a greater effect in 10 years on competitive skiing than the rest of the world in 25 centuries.” He grew to despair of what happened to his sport. He felt it had become too slick and professional, the snow over-prepared and the skiers too familiar with the terrain. But still, you guess he would take some satisfaction in watching Ryder, a Kandahar man, and another outsider, race for gold.",Sport/Sport,"At last, the inventors of modern skiing have something to cheer: Dave Ryding | Andy Bull",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/02/at-last-the-inventors-of-modern-skiing-have-something-to-cheer-dave-ryding
