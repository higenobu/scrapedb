2/25/2022,"(Bloomberg) — The Bank of Russia unveiled its first emergency measures in an attempt to stabilize the financial market after President Vladimir Putin ordered an attack Ukraine.

The regulator made no mention of raising interest rates but said it will provide additional liquidity to banks by offering 1 trillion rubles ($11.5 billion) in an overnight repo auction. Putin earlier on Thursday ordered Russian forces to attack targets across Ukraine in an operation to demilitarize the country, causing the ruble to tumble to a record low against the dollar. Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina has already raised rates by 525 basis points since March in an attempt to curb inflation.

2/25/2022,"Sanctions against Russia may not achieve their aim of forcing Vladimir Putin back to the negotiating table if his forces succeed in achieving their military objective before the country feels the economic pain. Russia may be enfeebled by years of dependence on commodity exports, yet the Kremlin has fattened itself on the proceeds of last year’s inflationary boom in energy prices. That means it’s now in a prime position to weather reprisals designed to sap his fiscal ability to wage war. “We will weaken Russia’s economic base and its capacity to modernize, and in addition we will freeze Russian assets in the European Union,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned on Thursday only hours after Putin launched combat operations. Waves of increasingly punishing financial sanctions imposed by Western allies may ultimately take too much time to unfold their full effect—valuable time Ukraine may not have. “President Putin’s decision to escalate the military confrontation into a war suggests a willingness to accept near-term economic pain in favor of securing long-term geopolitical goals,” wrote Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of global wealth management at UBS on Thursday. At first glance, Russia seems like an easy sanctions target given its calcified and uncompetitive economy that lives off exports harvested from the fields or mined out of the ground. Wealth inequality creates deep fissures in its society, vaccination hesitancy is rampant, and life expectancy at birth ranks just 159th in the world. “Russia continues to face relatively low potential growth, which, unless addressed, will impede the ability of the country to achieve high development goals, raising incomes and living standards,” wrote the World Bank in its latest country report published in December. Michael Hüther, director of the economic think tank IW in Cologne, Germany, argued the manufactured crisis in Ukraine offered Putin the chance to deflect from domestic problems such as its glacial pace of innovation and reliance on foreign imports of electronics, machinery, and other durable goods. “The path towards commercial independence from commodity exports is a very long one,” he wrote in an op-ed on Wednesday. “Russia is economically far weaker than it itself feels politically and projects militarily.” But despite its antiquated industry and dilapidated infrastructure, Russia may be better prepared than ever to weather the sanctions, crippling as they might be. First off, the country enjoys vast resources at its disposal, making it the world’s largest exporter of natural gas and wheat. And it’s likely no coincidence that the military offensive in Ukraine coincides with historically high energy prices, which have filled Russia’s coffers over previous months and given it an economic cushion. While many developed nations remain addicted to foreign capital to finance their consumption, Russia has proved it is more than capable of living within its means. At $82 billion in September, Russia’s current account surplus reached its highest since the global financial crisis, and its fiscal debt sits at just 16% of GDP, paltry compared with the euro area’s 98% figure at the end of the third quarter. Meanwhile, Russia continued last year to decouple itself financially from the global reserve currency system by accumulating more gold in its central bank vaults than it holds in U.S. dollars. According to the World Gold Council, stores of nearly 2,300 metric tons at the end of November are the fifth largest in the world after the U.S., Germany, Italy, and France. Putin’s Central Bank of Russia (CBR) also said it was “ready to take all necessary measures to maintain financial stability,” announcing forbearance measures on key balance sheet solvency metrics lasting until October to prop up any credit institutions that may see access to capital via interbank lending markets severed. According to UBS estimates, the CBR also holds some $640 billion in foreign exchange reserves, and could afford to pause further interventions to prop up the ruble. Furthermore Russia’s sovereign debt is largely impervious to attack from bond market vigilantes thanks to the share of foreign creditors falling below 20%. Finally the government always has the option to release some of its funds tied up in the National Welfare Fund, which bunkers proceeds from its petroleum industry for a rainy day. Its liquid assets alone equate to no less than 7% of the country’s gross domestic product. This puts the Kremlin in an enviable position compared with 2014 during its first land grab when it captured Crimea, Ukraine’s pro-Russian enclave on the Black Sea. That isn’t to say the icy frost of sanctions won’t put the chill on Russian risk assets. The MOEX benchmark tracking the country’s blue chips had already suffered heavy losses this week before halving in value on Thursday to plumb depths not seen since the start of 2016. With stock market prices plunging, Bloomberg reported sources as saying Putin has called major shareholders and the leaders of Russia’s biggest companies to the Kremlin to discuss the situation in Ukraine. Michael Roth, head of the German parliament’s foreign affairs committee, said the best hope for causing pain to Putin will not be making life miserable for the average Russian on the street. Instead the West needed to expand their campaign against the wealthy benefactors of Putin’s economic system, only a handful of which have been singled out thus far. Prominent individuals like Roman Abramovich have escaped sanctions, and one even enjoys a cushy lifetime appointment to the U.K.’s House of Lords. “Our sanctions must above all target Putin’s system of oligarchy,” said Roth. “We have to drain the resources from all those millionaires and billionaires that enriched themselves in his shadow and now enjoy privileges like sending their kids to schools in the West, buying luxury flats in Berlin and London, and going on ski holidays to Austria.” Maybe then Putin can be forced back to the negotiating table.

2/25/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s rout on Thursday is the fifth-worst plunge in equity market history in local currency terms as investors sold the nation’s assets following the country’s invasion of Ukraine. Most Read from Bloomberg Russia Invasion of Ukraine Ignites European Security Crisis Russia Hits Airfields; Kyiv Imposes Martial Law: Ukraine Update Western Allies See Kyiv Falling Within Hours: Ukraine Update Stocks Pare Slide as U.S. Announces More Sanctions: Markets Wrap The $200 Billion Club Loses Last Member as Elon Musk’s Wealth Tumbles The benchmark MOEX Russia Index closed 33% lower in Moscow, erasing $189 billion in shareholder wealth, as Western leaders vowed to step up penalties on Russia after military forces entered Ukraine. That’s the fifth most brutal one-day selloff among 90 global equity indexes analyzed by Bloomberg. This is the first time since 1987 that a selloff of this magnitude has hit a market worth more than $50 billion. In the aftermath of the Black Monday crash that year, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index tumbled 33%. The worst single-day drop over the past century in any market of any size was Argentina’s 53% slump in January 1990, when the country was battling hyperinflation and a mounting economic crisis. The drop in Russia’s benchmark matches that of Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index during the aftermath of the Black Monday crash in 1987. When looking at markets of all sizes, the biggest single-day drop on record was Argentina’s 53% slump in January 1990, when the Latin American country was in the middle of an economic crisis and period of hyperinflation. All calculations are based on local currencies. To be sure, some of the world’s major indexes have circuit breakers that prevent them from falling beyond a certain level. For instance, the benchmark S&P 500 index has a so-called limit down level at 20%, after which trading would be closed for the day. Russia became the world’s cheapest stock market this week as repeated negotiations to avert a military conflict failed, leaving investors fretting over geopolitical risks in addition to worries over inflation, Federal Reserve tightening and renewed regulatory curbs in China. The MOEX gauge’s price-to-earnings ratio fell below 3 times projected profits after starting the year at 5.4 times. (Updates prices with Russian market close.)

2/25/2022,"What to make of the situation in Eastern Europe? Russia has massed forces on the Ukrainian border, and recognized two adjacent Ukrainian provinces – both with ethnic Russian population majorities – as independent. The US has matched this bellicosity with saber rattling of its own, although the Biden Administration has made it clear that it will oppose Russian moves with economic sanctions rather than force. The result: a geopolitical mess that is threatening stability from Moscow to Washington and all points in between. Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has added some fuel to investor concerns, making public its stance on market fortunes should an open conflict – or harsh sanctions against Russia – take effect. In either of those cases, the firm sees the S&P 500 index losing another 6% in the immediate aftermath. Such a loss would come on top of the ~10% drop the index has already seen this year. When markets and futures are uncertain, and volatility is high, the logical portfolio move is into high-yield dividend payers. These are the classic defensive plays, giving investors a dual path toward returns, from both the share appreciation and the dividend payments. Bearing this in mind, we used the TipRanks' database to zero-in on two stocks that are showing high dividend yields – on the order of 8% or more. Each stock also holds a Strong Buy consensus rating; let’s see what makes them so attractive to Wall Street’s analysts. KKR Real Estate Finance Trust (KREF) It’s no surprise to find a REIT on a list of dividend champs – these companies, which buy, own, lease, and manage a variety of real properties, have long been known for their high-yield dividends. KKR, which operates primarily in 9 states (New York, California, Texas, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Colorado, Illinois, and Florida) has a real estate portfolio composed mostly (over 98%) of senior loans. The company’s property investments are mainly in multifamily dwellings and commercial office space, although there are also significant investments in life sciences properties and the hospitality sector. Earlier this month, KKR reported its 4Q and full-year results for 2021. The company reported that its investment portfolio was valued at $6.8 billion as of the end of 2021, and that it had $6.7 billion in financing capacity. KKR has $41 billion worth of real estate assets under management, an average loan size of $131 million – and best of all, 100% of all loans are described as ‘performing.’ For the full year, the company had 58 cents per share in distributable earnings. That last is a key point, since distributable earnings fund the dividend. On February 1, the company declared a common stock dividend of 40.625 cents. This annualizes to $1.625 per common share, for a yield of 8%. Covering KREF for BTIG, analyst Tim Hayes writes: “KREF has $900M of loans either closed or in the process of closing (most of which are multifamily), which we expect to drive net growth in 1Q22 and put the portfolio in a position to benefit from higher rates by late 1Q22/early 2Q22. Credit performance remained strong in 4Q21, with 100% of the loan portfolio performing, and management provided positive updates on watchlist credits (one of which repaid in full subsequent to quarter-end). Shares currently offer an 8.1% yield — an attractive spread to other fixed-income securities, in our opinion, given the low-risk profile of KREF's portfolio.” Based on the above, Hayes gives KREF a Buy rating, and his $23.50 price target indicates confidence in 12% upside by the end of this year. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~20% potential total return profile. (To watch Hayes’ track record, click here) The analyst consensus on KREF shares is a Strong Buy and it is unanimous, based on 3 positive reviews set in recent weeks. The stock is selling for $20.87, with an average price target of $23; this gives it a potential upside of ~10%. (See KREF stock analysis on TipRanks) Ellington Financial (EFC) And now we’ll turn to another REIT, Ellington Financial. This company takes a broad approach to the REIT field; instead of focusing on just one type of asset, it invests in multiple types of real properties and related securities. Ellington’s portfolio includes equity investments, mortgage-backed securities, and both commercial and residential mortgage loans. Ellington reports its Q4 results on February 23, but it’s worth looking back briefly at the previous quarter to get a feel for the company’s performance. In 3Q21, EFC reported $47.7 million at the top line, up 18% year-over-year, and core EPS of 46 cents. While the Q3 EPS had fallen 5 cents from the previous quarter, it was still enough to fund the monthly dividend. At 15 cents per common share, the dividend comes to 45 cents per quarter, and yields an impressive 10.4%. The company most recent dividend declaration, made on February 7, keeps the payment at the current level and will be paid out on March 25. Analyst Trevor Cranston, writing from JMP Securities, describes Ellington as a near-perfect defensive stock, writing: “We believe that Ellington Financial has consistently demonstrated its ability to generate best-in-class risk-adjusted returns among the residential mortgage REIT group, which in our view is largely attributable to the company’s outstanding protection of book value that has allowed it to generate positive economic returns every year since its founding, including in turbulent years such as 2008 and 2020..."" ""As a result of EFC’s consistent protection of its capital base, we view the company’s long-term risk-adjusted return prospects to be among the best in the mortgage REIT universe and believe the company continues to be a most attractive investment opportunity for long-term dividend-oriented investors,” Cranston added. These comments support Cranston’s Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, while his $20 price target indicates room for an upside of 16% this year. (To watch Cranston’s track record, click here) Judging by the consensus breakdown, opinions are anything but mixed. With 3 Buys and no Holds or Sells assigned in the last three months, the word on the Street is that Ellington is a Strong Buy. At $19.50, the average price target implies ~14% upside potential from current levels.
