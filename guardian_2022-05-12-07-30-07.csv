5/12/2022,"Antonio Conte remembers the last north London derby and he was not even the Tottenham manager at the time. “It was a difficult period for my team,” Conte says, and there is no doubt the 3-1 reverse at Arsenal in late September was the nadir. “For sure, at that moment, the confidence was down.” Pierre-Emile Højbjerg shudders at the memory. It was not just the defeat but the manner of it. At times, during a nightmarish first half, it looked as if he was manning the Spurs midfield alone. Arsenal tore through, running in three goals inside 34 minutes. Their dominance was total; the lead unassailable. “It was not good and it hurt a lot,” Højbjerg says. “It’s something that, as a player, you cannot accept. What happened the last time at the Emirates is absolutely a no-go, absolutely something that is not worthy [of us].” For Spurs, the derby is always the game of the season, a reference point, and it is often tempting to plot their progress from one to the next. Back in September, Spurs were only six matches into the Premier League season and the managerial tenure of Nuno Espírito Santo. But everybody knew. It was over for him. Nuno would limp on, although not for long, being sacked at the end of October after the 3-0 home loss to Manchester United. At which point, enter Conte with a brief – in his words – “to try to improve the situation … the club didn’t ask me to go for a place in the Champions League or Europa League”. Spurs were eighth after losing five of their previous seven matches. Not good, as Conte says, and “only a crazy person could imagine that with three games to go we’d be in the race for a Champions League place”. But as Spurs prepare, belatedly, to welcome Arsenal to their stadium on Thursday night, it is precisely where they are. Conte’s record in the league reads: W14 D5 L6 Pts 47 and, when transposed across 38 games, it adds up to a 71.4-point season. He has galvanised the squad. And now comes the reckoning in a showdown that is heavy on juicy plotlines: revenge (as above), huge significance for the future direction of both clubs and, frankly, litres of bad blood. When Spurs last hosted this fixture, it was December 2020, José Mourinho was their manager and a 2-0 win had them on top of the table. It feels like a lifetime ago. There were no fans in attendance because of the pandemic and nor had there been any for the stadium’s first derby in July 2020, which Spurs won 2-1. This will be the first at the venue in front of a crowd and, if the atmosphere promises to be electric, there is also the possibility of it falling horribly flat for Spurs, adding further to the tension. Conte’s team know that in all likelihood they must win if they are to take the fight for a top-four place into the penultimate or final round of fixtures and even then they would be relying on a favour from elsewhere. But if Arsenal were to win, they would secure a Champions League finish at the expense of their neighbours. This is not what the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was built to witness. The game was originally scheduled for 16 January, but Arsenal successfully applied for a postponement as they contended with a selection crisis, although not one related to positive Covid cases. Spurs were fuming and released a spiky statement that got their feelings across with absolute clarity. When Conte reflects on the episode, he continues to use words such as “strange” and “unfair”. Conte does admit that “it is right to play this type of game with all the players available” and says what matters to him are the improvements his own have made since then, tactically and physically. And the bigger picture, too. Winning a derby must be a means to reach a grand target, not an end in itself. “There is a big rivalry [between Spurs and Arsenal], we know it very well, the players know it very well and we want to give satisfaction to our fans,” Conte says. “But when I have played other derbies, with Inter or Juventus, I’ve always said that a derby is one game, or two games, in a season and a big team has to win the derby, not because it’s your rival but because you get three points and they bring you nearer to winning something important. Our mind has to be open for an important target, for winning a derby to be a way to reach this.” Conte can be proud that he has driven his team from a low starting point into contention for a top-four place, a prize he describes as being “like winning a title in another country”. It has come to hinge on a derby like few others and, Conte hopes, nothing like the last one. “I think and I hope to see another type of game because many situations have changed,” Conte says. “We want to show that we are a good team and we can fight for the Champions League.”",Sport/Football,Conte ready to show Arsenal how far Spurs have come since September,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/11/antonio-conte-ready-show-arsenal-how-far-spurs-have-come-since-september-north-london-derby
5/12/2022,"The Labour MP Stella Creasy has disclosed that she was threatened with gang-rape amid a campaign of sexual harassment after entering student politics at the University of Cambridge. While running for a student council role in the mid-1990s, the Walthamstow MP said she was reprimanded by college authorities instead of action being taken against the men involved. “I’m in my mid-40s now and it’s the first time I’ve really felt even willing to talk about it,” Creasy said in an interview with the broadcaster and former Labour MP Gloria De Piero for GB News. “It was terrifying at the time, I’m terrified I’ll ever run into those young men again.” There have been a slew of revelations about sexism and harassment in Westminster, and up to 56 MPs have been accused of sexual misconduct. But Creasy, a prominent campaigner for women’s rights, including granting mothers the resources to run for parliament, said a culture of “privilege and entitlement” was not unique to parliament but a problem in universities as well. “It’s always the men that people think are least likely to do it who are involved in it,” she said. She said she had experienced sexual harassment “all my life” and she remained terrified of seeing the men who had threatened her at university, who she said had gone on to be doctors, civil servants and “high flyers”. After running into the men several years after the incident, she said, she collapsed to a bar floor and left as soon as she could. Creasy said the abuse would always affect her. She said her first experience of sexual harassment was during her first year at Magdalene College and lasted from 1996 to 1998. She said it included a campaign of abusive posters when she ran for the role of president of the college’s student council. “I’ll never forget the night that I was in a room with them all and they threatened to gang-rape me, let alone the posters that they put up around the college when I had the temerity to stand for a position in the student union, telling people not to vote for me because of who I’d slept with,” she said. “And that happened at a Cambridge college. “I was held up and I was admonished by the college authorities at the time because they chose to believe the idea that I was probably ‘a wronged woman’,” she said. “And, as I say, it took public humiliation, and posters, and finally other people coming forward, and me collating the evidence – of all the notes, the spitting in my room, the rubbish that was thrown at me, the sexual abuse and harassment if I tried to walk into the bar, that came from this group of young men.” Creasy studied psychology at Cambridge from 1996 to 1999, going on to gain a PhD from the London School of Economics. She entered the Commons in 2010. Addressing women with similar experiences, and those in parliament, she said: “You will find allies, you will find those of us prepared to stand with you because we know what it’s like, we know how hard it is and we know the impact it can have on you.” A Cambridge spokesperson said: “We are extremely sorry to hear of the horrific ordeal which Stella Creasy experienced. Sexual harassment of any sort has absolutely no place at the university. In recent years the university has taken significant steps in order to provide support for victims of sexual misconduct, to improve systems for reporting any incidents, and to take action as a result. “We urge anyone who experiences any form of harassment or abuse to report it so that they can be offered support and action can be taken. The university employs a sexual assault and harassment adviser to provide specialist support to victims.”  Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations. In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support on 0808 802 9999 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 in Scotland, or 0800 0246 991 in Northern Ireland. In the US, Rainn offers support on 800-656-4673.

5/12/2022,"Mikel Arteta says Arsenal will go for the three points that would secure Champions League football when they make the short journey to Tottenham on Thursday night, even though a draw would ensure they remain overwhelming favourites to take fourth spot. Arsenal can arguably afford a cagey approach given that, if they restrict Antonio Conte’s team to a draw, they would stay four points in front of Spurs with two games remaining. But the prize that a win would bring is irresistible and Arteta was in no mood to play down the significance when it was put to him that pragmatism could serve Arsenal perfectly well. “We always play to win and that’s the way we will prepare this game,” he said. “I’m sure [Spurs] will try to do the same. That’s why hopefully it’s a really spectacular game. “It’s the opportunity to achieve something we haven’t achieved for many years. It’s the game that will decide it. Normally you don’t play games like that in the league unless you are competing for the trophy but we know that, at our level, what this game can deliver to us is really important.” Arsenal have won their past four games with a patched-up side, sometimes making life difficult for themselves in the process, and Arteta hopes Ben White will be fit to add defensive stability after missing the victories over West Ham and Leeds with a hamstring injury. He also suggested he was waiting on the fitness of Bukayo Saka, who has sustained several knocks recently and came off towards the end of the Leeds game, although it would be a surprise if the winger did not start. Arteta will urge his players to master the intensity of the occasion, which is the first derby to be played in front of fans at Spurs’ new home. “The expectation is huge,” he said. “This is an opportunity for one of the clubs to achieve what we are looking for, and on top of that is the emotion and the passion that the derby brings with it. We need to be away from that and focusing on what we have to do. To win the match we are going to have to be at our very best.” As a player Arteta helped Arsenal over the line to Champions League qualification several times, not least in 2013 when Laurent Koscielny scored a winner against Newcastle on the final day to ensure they pipped Spurs to fourth. That guaranteed Arsenal’s 16th consecutive presence at the top table but, given they have spent five years away from Europe’s biggest competition, he knows this achievement would take on a new significance. “At the time the club was very consistent achieving a Champions League spot so it was almost a must,” he said. “Now the perception is a little bit different because we haven’t been able to do that, so we didn’t have expectations to be where we are. It’s a game that can help us move forwards quicker than expected.”",Sport/Football,Mikel Arteta says Arsenal will go for the jugular in derby against Tottenham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/11/mikel-arteta-arsenal-will-go-for-jugular-north-london-derby-tottenham
5/12/2022,"Normal service has been resumed. Jamie Vardy, without a goal since 1 March, scored twice in eight minutes to return Leicester City to the top half of the Premier League with their first win in eight games as Norwich City’s loyal fans celebrated their biennial relegation from the top flight with unstinting irony. At set triggers, the Norwich fans launched into synchronised leaping and singing, even after James Maddison scored the 78th goal against them this season, the most they have conceded in a top‑flight season. Their last four seasons in the Premier League have ended in relegation but Dean Smith is relishing the challenge ahead. Maddison made the game safe 20 minutes from time as he leathered the ball home, left-footed, from 12 yards out after Angus Gunn could only parry Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s fierce cross from the inside-left channel of the penalty area. Leicester’s resources have been stretched to breaking point at times this season but, after the disappointment of losing in the Europa Conference League semi-final against Roma last week, this was a reminder that the hunger still burns brightly in the stomachs of Vardy, Maddison and, even if his days appear numbered at Leicester, Youri Tielemans. “I thought he was excellent tonight,” Brendan Rodgers said of the midfielder being linked with a move to Arsenal. “The speculation shines a light on him. For me, he’s still the same guy, his professionalism is first class. That’s why I always play him.” Both managers are looking forward to this season ending, for different reasons. “I’ve applied to the Premier League to ask if we can play Wolves tomorrow and Tottenham on Friday,” Dean Smith joked. “It won’t be a big rebuild in the summer. We’ve got players more than capable of performing strongly in the Championship.” This may have been a dead rubber to the neutral but for Rodgers it was dead serious. Eight games without a win would have constituted Leicester’s worst run since Claudio Ranieri was dismissed in February 2017 – Claude Puel departed after seven – and he responded by selecting his strongest available XI, after Wesley Fofana dropped out late on with a tight calf. “We don’t want the season to go out with a whimper,” the Leicester manager said. “It felt a bit flat at the weekend [in losing 2-1 at home against Everton] but we had a good chat. We want to finish in the top 10. In the summer, we’ll look to improve the squad, have a good pre-season and be ready to go flying into next season.” Back in came Vardy, Maddison, Harvey Barnes, Ademola Lookman and James Justin, but if anything the team was too attack-orientated in the first half, susceptible to the counterattack, and it took the half‑time introduction of Nampalys Mendy, a midfielder happy to hold, to redress the balance. Gunn, who replaced Tim Krul in the Norwich goal, had twice saved from Maddison, and from Vardy on the follow-up, in the opening dozen minutes but Norwich had their chances. Tony Springett, on his full debut, was in an inconceivable amount of space when found by Milot Rashica but Kasper Schmeichel saved both his effort and that of Teemu Pukki, who hit the post in first-half stoppage time when sent away by Springett. “There was too much space in the game for me in the first half,” Rodgers said. “So we changed the structure of the midfield, and from the first roll of the ball, we were much better in the second half.” Vardy made one of his trademark runs in behind down the left channel, from Barnes’s pass, before cutting back in on to his right foot. The shot was powerful but did not look goal-bound until it ricocheted off Grant Hanley’s block and looped over Gunn for the veteran striker’s 13th goal of the season. His 14th soon followed. Again Barnes was the provider as the winger collected Justin’s short pass before playing a perfectly timed through ball for Vardy to run off the back of Hanley and unload a lusty left-footer into the near top corner.",Sport/Football,Jamie Vardy double lifts Leicester and piles more misery on Norwich,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/11/leicester-norwich-premier-league-match-report
5/12/2022,"Jesse Marsch has spoken effusively of his use of motivational quotes from the likes of Mahatma Gandhi to inspire his Leeds players but at the rate his side’s fortunes are spiralling, he would perhaps be wise to draw inspiration from Harry Houdini instead. Rudyard Kipling’s legendary poem, If, discusses the importance of keeping your head when all around you are losing theirs but as the door on Leeds United’s Premier League status inches shut, the last four days show they are playing with an inverse mindset. Defeats to Arsenal and Chelsea should not ordinarily define a team’s Premier League survival chances but it is the nature of them which are concerning. Conceding early is disastrous enough, as Leeds did on Sunday and again here when Mason Mount struck past Illan Meslier after four minutes. But to receive red cards in the first half of both games for tackles which are entirely avoidable is the very definition of deepening your own mire. After Luke Ayling’s dismissal at Arsenal three days earlier, Dan James followed suit here with a terrible tackle on Mateo Kovacic that left Anthony Taylor with little choice but to dismiss him. James looked stunned. Marsch looked flustered on the touchline. But the reality is from that moment this game was a formality, with further goals from Christian Pulisic and Romelu Lukaku compounding Leeds’s misery and moving Chelsea eight points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham. Leeds now know that with their inferior goal difference, even wins against Brighton and Brentford in their final two games may not be enough to keep them up. “The guys are gutted because we’re not giving ourselves the chances we want coming into the match, and that part hurts,” Marsch said. “We have six points left, and we have to do everything we can to recover and stay mentally strong. We’re not perfect but we’re together. We have to be aggressive against the ball and try to win balls, and sometimes we’ve been too aggressive in certain situations and it’s cost us.” With the FA Cup final three days away, this was a welcome return to form for Chelsea. Yes, they were aided by James’s red card but they were much the stronger of the two sides, underlined by Mount’s strike after just four minutes. It always felt an inevitability they would extend that lead when Leeds were reduced to 10 men, and shortly after the restart they did that when Pulisic fired low past Meslier. “We played very well from the first minute,” Tuchel said. “I was happy with the level of focus and determination. You need to be disciplined because Leeds never stop running.” However, there were ramifications from this polished Chelsea display, with Kovacic forced off injured after that tackle from James and now “very unlikely” to play at Wembley on Saturday. “We will see, we’ll need to wait and pray for a miracle,” Tuchel said. Mount’s opener certainly stifled the pre-match atmosphere inside Elland Road, with the tension all too palpable as the games begin to run out. Leeds could, and perhaps should, have been more than one goal behind by half-time but the result was decided by James’s shocking tackle. He certainly got the ball but the Welshman was also high, reckless and dangerous in doing so, and despite protestation from the home supporters, the replays left James with little supporting evidence. So when Pulisic scored past Meslier 10 minutes after the restart, any notion Leeds could scramble at least a point from such a desperate situation was swept aside. There was endeavour in response but not a single shot on target, underlining another of Leeds’s key problems. But Chelsea deserve credit for the manner in which they handled a rumbustious home crowd and a potentially tricky evening’s work. The third goal always felt inevitable but after a slew of missed chances it took until the final seven minutes to arrive. Diego Llorente dallied in possession in midfield, Chelsea sprung on the counter and Lukaku eventually rifled into the top corner to seal a victory which takes Tuchel’s side a step closer to securing a top-four finish which, at one stage, seemed like an inevitability. This result will have certainly built confidence before the final on Saturday evening, if nothing else. But as Chelsea cantered to victory and the momentum from Marsch’s arrival dissipated further into a mere flutter, it was hard not to think of the last days of Marcelo Bielsa and wonder if, really, Leeds are any better off than the day they decided to part company with the Argentinian. Only the next two fixtures, their biggest in living memory, will tell us the answer decisively.",Sport/Football,Chelsea stroll to victory and crank up pressure on 10-man Leeds,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/11/leeds-united-chelsea-premier-league-match-report
