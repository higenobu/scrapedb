His mother replies that it would give her a ""buzz"" too if she were in his shoes. Source: Central Intelligence Agency Details: It is reported that Solovyov is currently in Kharkiv Region. Ukrainian intelligence agents have also published the personal data of the occupier and his mother. In the conversation with his mother, the occupier reveals details of the torture of Ukrainian prisoners by the Russian military. The occupier tells of horrific abuse and killings carried out by FSB officers and the Russian military. He also admits that civilians have also been the victims of the executioners. The aggressor recalls the heroic behaviour of Ukrainians who, even under the most horrific torture, do not submit to the invaders.

Subscribe Wednesday, May 4, 2022 In the face of rising inflation, the Federal Reserve looks poised to do something it has not done in two decades: Implement a king-sized bump in interest rates. Rewind to May 2000, when things were very different (i.e. Razor Scooters were catching on and *NSYNC was topping the Billboard charts). But much like today, concerns were building about higher inflation down the road. In the face of “inflationary imbalances,” the Fed led by Alan Greenspan raised interest rates by 0.50% to a target of 6.5%. That would be the last time the Fed would ever raise interest rates by that much in one move, opting instead to 0.25% increases at a time. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues will likely break that spell at the conclusion of today’s meeting. Powell said April 21 that an outsized rate increase of 0.50% “will be on the table.” San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly suggested that the more aggressive moves will be on the table for future meetings as well. “We will likely be taking a 50-basis-point increase in a couple of the meetings,” she told Yahoo Finance April 21. Despite the historical significance of a 0.50% move, some have argued that more will be needed to win the firefight against the rapid pace of price increases. Whereas measures of inflation (personal consumption expenditures) were showing prices rising annually by 2.4% in May 2000, price increases now are pacing at almost 7%. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, for example, has floated the idea of going even bigger: a 0.75% move. Markets are not expecting that gigantic hike in today’s meeting. Fed funds futures, the betting market for Fed moves, were pricing in a 99% chance of a 0.50% move as of Tuesday afternoon. Alongside any move on interest rates, the Fed is also expected to announce a strategy in undoing the trillions in asset purchases it made since the beginning of the pandemic. Up until March, the Fed was absorbing U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities to message its support to financial markets. Preliminary discussions held in March outlined a rough plan to shrink its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet, which detailed a strategy of allowing up to $95 billion a month in maturing assets to roll off. The Fed decision is due at 2 p.m. ET. Powell’s press conference, the first to be held in person since the pandemic, will begin at 2:30 p.m. ET.

5/4/2022,"Social media users are denouncing the actions of a group of teens in Singapore who filmed themselves pulling pranks inside a McDonald’s restaurant at Punggol Safra.

Facebook page Singapore Incidents shared a clip on Monday showing a teen boy carrying two cups of water and then pouring the contents onto himself while inside the fast food restaurant. Two girls can be seen filming the boy as he does the stunt. Immediately after the act, the group bolts out of the restaurant running.

 

According to the post, a boy from the group had earlier “slapped his face with an ice cream and threw it on the floor.”

The caption also noted that an older worker had to clean up the mess the teens left behind.

""The poor old uncle had to clean after their mess. On top of that, they did not clear their trays.""

As of this writing, the clip has been viewed over 60,000 times and has attracted over 130 comments.

Commenters criticized the teens for the behavior, which some pointed out was an act of stupidity.

“Have brains the size of peas. Pure stupidity and a public nuisance,” a commenter said.

Some lamented that the acts were nothing but an attempt to film a viral social media video.

“For the sake of a Tiktok video or fame or viewers ???” wrote another. “Do it at home la why inconvenient the staff. Inconsiderate ppl.”

Meanwhile, other commenters attributed the teens’ behavior to poor parenting.

“Making a fool of themselves at the expense of the poor service staff,” a user wrote. “Another upbringing issue.”

“Who's kids are they? Escapee from orphanage? No parents teach,” noted another.

Oniki put the missile's range at 500km (311 miles) and its maximum altitude at 800km (497 miles). He said the ministry was still analysing the data to determine what type of missile it was. The launch, which marks the North's 14th major weapons test this year, comes days before South Korea's newly elected President Yoon Suk-yeol takes office on May 10.
