4/29/2022,"NatWest has reported a 40% jump in first quarter profits but warned of the UK’s “uncertain” economy amid the cost of living crisis, saying it had already referred more than 2,000 customers to debt experts at Citizens Advice. The banking group – formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland – beat expectations after reporting a jump in pre-tax profits to £1.2bn compared with £885m a year earlier. That was compared to analyst forecasts of a 15% drop in profits to £755m. Its strong first quarter results – the first reported since the UK government stake in the group fell below 50% last month – was supported by mortgage borrowing, higher interest rates and a rebound in consumer spending as Covid restrictions were eased. NatWest was also able to release £38m of the cash it originally put aside for potential defaults on loans during the pandemic, despite what it said was “significant uncertainty in the economic outlook”. That contrasts with action taken by banking peers such as Lloyds and Barclays, which were forced to take higher provisions for defaults in light of the cost of living crisis in the first quarter, amid fears that customers could fall behind on loan payments after inflation hit 7% last month. “The world has changed considerably during the last three months,” said NatWest’s chief executive, Alison Rose, noting the impact the Russian invasion of Ukraine was having on the UK economy. “We are also very aware of the challenges and concerns the cost-of-living crisis is causing for many of our customers up and down the country. NatWest Group is focused on providing practical help and support for the people, families and businesses we serve”, Rose added. NatWest said it had identified vulnerable customers and had referred 2,100 people to Citizens Advice in the last year. The bank’s results come just a day after NatWest executives avoided a shareholder rebellion over a pay policy that could net the chief executive as much as £5.2m a year. NatWest defended the proposals, saying that while the bank was aware the policy could court controversy, the changes would bring executive pay closer to levels offered by rival UK banks. The resolution passed with nearly 93% voting in favour of the policy on Thursday. Commenting on the first quarter results, Rose said: “Despite the challenging environment, I am pleased with our performance as we continue to execute well against our strategy, driving sustainable growth and returns.”",News/Business,NatWest reports 40% profit jump as bank refers customers to debt experts,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/29/natwest-reports-40-profit-jump-as-bank-refers-customers-to-debt-experts
4/29/2022,"Elon Musk has sold almost $4bn (£3.2bn) worth of Tesla shares since securing his $44bn deal to take control of Twitter. Musk, the electric carmaker’s chief executive, sold the stock on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to a regulatory filing. The sales came as Tesla’s share price plummeted amid investor concern that the multibillionaire would offload stock in the company to help fund the all-cash deal for Twitter. Musk took to Twitter late on Thursday after the filing at the US Securities and Exchange Commission became public to say he planned no further sales of Tesla shares “after today”. No further TSLA sales planned after today The terms of the Twitter deal require Musk to come up with about $21bn in cash, although it is not expected to close for another six months. Tesla’s stock dropped more than 12% on Tuesday after the announcement of Musk’s takeover of Twitter, the biggest one-day drop since September 2020, as investors worried Musk would not have as much time to drive the electric car business as competition in the sector hots up. The carmaker’s share price has fallen by a fifth since Musk first disclosed he had taken a stake in Twitter earlier this month. Musk is using his Tesla valuable holdings, which have made him the richest person in the world, to part fund the takeover of Twitter. The sale of almost 4.5m shares, made at prices ranging from $872 to $999 a share, were the first by Musk since a spree late last year that raised more than $16bn, which came after he asked his more than 80 million Twitter followers whether he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla.",News/Technology,Elon Musk sells almost $4bn worth of Tesla shares after Twitter deal,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/29/elon-musk-sells-almost-4bn-worth-of-tesla-shares-after-twitter-deal
4/29/2022,"The US has left the “pandemic phase” at least for now, chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci said this week, at the same time that the White House presses for urgently needed Covid-19 funding. But as cases continue mounting around the globe, the pandemic shows no signs of ending yet – and conflicting pictures offered by top health officials may hamper the renewal of critical Covid funds and efforts like vaccination campaigns. In an interview on Tuesday, Fauci painted an optimistic, if mixed, picture. “We are certainly, right now in this country, out of the pandemic phase,” he said, before adding, “Pandemic means a widespread, throughout the world, infection that spreads rapidly among people.” Such a definition still applies to the Covid pandemic, experts say. While confirmed cases in the US are lower than during the first Omicron wave, they are rising in nearly all American states, and the virus continues spreading around the world. On the same day as Fauci’s remarks, top White House officials highlighted in a press briefing the “urgent need” for replenishing Covid funds. “So far, Congress has not stepped up to provide the funds that are needed for our most urgent needs,” said Ashish Jha, the White House Covid response coordinator. Without these funds, the US may not be able to buy updated vaccines that may be more effective at battling Covid. The government will probably run out of monoclonal antibody treatments within the next month, and the White House cannot buy more antiviral medications, which take six to eight months to produce – setting back long-term progress on finding a new normal. The Biden administration will continue to request $22.5bn for Covid funding, press secretary Jen Psaki said in a briefing on Wednesday, saying the funds “will help meet the immediate emergency needs we have”. The current deal for $10bn in Covid funding has not yet been passed by Congress, and it does not include funds for global vaccination campaigns or for Covid testing and treatments for uninsured Americans. “The funding needs are really urgent,” said Céline Gounder, infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist and editor-at-large for public health at Kaiser Health News. Without more funds, “you are just gambling – you’re hoping to get lucky we don’t have another surge.” But that’s a “dangerous” proposition when such a significant proportion of the population has no safety net, she said. “One in 10 people in this country do not have insurance. Those are also the people, unfortunately, who are the most vulnerable, the most likely to get exposed and infected, the most likely to have underlying chronic medical conditions that will predict progression to severe Covid.” In addition to tests and treatments for uninsured and underinsured people, Americans need paid sick leave to stay home when they or their children get sick, in order to halt further spread, she said. And less than a third of the American population has received a booster shot, even as officials open up second boosters for certain vulnerable people. Leaders have struggled to drum up interest in the boosters as many Americans heed the call to return to normal. Fauci may be using a psychological or economic definition to argue that things are getting back to normal, but not an epidemiological one, Gounder said. “I was a bit surprised by his comments, because that’s not really the technical definition,” she said. It’s too early to tell if cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are leveling out to predictable levels, she said. “I don’t think we can say that yet. We just had a big surge over the winter holidays with BA.1. It’s still a little unclear how BA.2 is going to play out in the US … we haven’t really seen the full impact of BA.2 and some of the subsequent subvariants which are even more infectious.” Fauci, who has pulled out of attending the White House Correspondents Association dinner because of rising cases in Washington DC, noted in the interview that case counts are probably undercounted, and the relatively low numbers in the US could still rise. In early February, he said the US was exiting “the full blown” pandemic phase of the pandemic, even as more than 2,500 Americans were dying every day. At that point, the White House was already aware of the rapidly diminishing Covid funding and quietly urged Congress to replenish the budget. “Infectious disease control is not something you can do just at an individual level,” Gounder said. “If we have large segments of the population for which we cannot provide testing, treatment, vaccination – that’s a huge liability in terms of emerging from the pandemic.”",News/World news,Anthony Fauci says the US is not in a ‘pandemic phase’.

4/29/2022,"He spends all his evenings in the corner of our dining room, immersed in a fantasy world My husband Jim is obsessed with video games. When I get home from work after him, I know that I’ll find him on the desktop in the corner of our dining room immersed in a fantasy world. When it’s dinner time, it’s a struggle to get him off and to sit at the table with me and our son. He says, “OK, I’ll pause it after this battle.” It’s a bit disruptive to our evening. Sometimes Jim comes to bed really late after playing games – one time he didn’t come upstairs until 2am. Jim plays games with dragons, tanks, battles and soldiers. They’re all very noisy. Sometimes if I’m washing up after dinner and Jim is still playing, I’ll ask him to turn it down. He reluctantly obliges, but I know he prefers to play them at full blast. Sometimes he puts up a bit of resistance and says that I’m “ruining the experience” for him. He won’t get headphones. Although Jim and I both do our share of the housework, there are times I have to say, “Can you help me with this?” He’ll say, “One minute,” but that minute never comes. Jim works hard in a government job. When he comes home from work he wants to switch off. He’s a very hands-on father, but our son, who is seven, is starting to copy Jim and likes sitting alongside him while he plays. Boys will be boys, I suppose. But I’d like there to be a bit more time for us to enjoy more leisure time as a family. After dinner and homework, they play games together for hours. I usually go into the next room and watch television. They stay in the same spot all evening. Perhaps I’m a bit jealous. I have absolutely no interest in computer games, but sometimes I’d like the boys to come into the sitting room and for us all to chat together while watching a film. Jim should try and ration the computer games on weekdays at least. Dinner together is nice but we need more time without the video games in the background. I don’t want Jim to set a bad example for our son, and for him not to develop any other hobbies. After work I need to switch off, but I only play after I’ve made dinner and helped our son with homework I have to admit, I do love playing my video games. They require zero concentration, are lots of fun and I don’t have to communicate with anyone. After a day of work, I need to switch off. When I watch a film with Marlene, she wants to talk every two seconds about what’s happening, or who the main character is. When she watches her soaps there’s also a lot of commentary too – that’s why I don’t really enjoy it. Playing games is a solitary affair, and I like that. Marlene has her way of switching off and I have mine. What’s the issue? And our son likes to get involved with my games now, too. I think Marlene envies the fact that we are both really into gaming. I enjoy spending time with him while we play. Marlene could always ask me to teach her how to play, too, then we could do it together. I’d be more than happy to get her involved. She hates it, though. She says it’s “a man thing”. During the week, I always make sure I’ve done our son’s homework with him before we play. I also cook dinner most nights. Marlene may complain, but everything that needs to be done for the family is done first, and the gaming comes second. If Marlene needs a hand with something, I’m always available . Sometimes she asks me to turn the volume down, if the music or the fighting sounds are annoying her, and I always do. Headphones aren’t really something I find comfortable wearing. And anyway, if I did, Marlene would probably get more annoyed as I’d be shutting her out completely. It’s rare that I keep Marlene awake with my gaming. The one time I went to bed at 2am I simply got carried away. I apologised the next morning, and it hasn’t happened since. However I do enjoy the nights after everyone has gone to bed and I’m alone with the computer. I get to play League of Legends or Age of Empires, undisturbed, for hours. It’s bliss. I think we have a good balance in our house. I don’t think reducing my time on the computer is necessary. Should Jim spend less time gaming? Jim sounds like a very attentive father, bonding well with his son and doing his share of the housework. However, Marlene needs family time, too, and blasting out gaming soundtracks is a bit much, as is refusing to use headphones. As a lockdown guitarist, I know headphones help make a happy home. And as for offering to teach Marlene how to play? Well, that’s just insulting.David, 51 Video games are irrelevant to the fact that they’re both guilty. Jim, it’s time you realised that being in a relationship means carving out some time for your partner. Marlene, complaining about what Jim likes will only make him defensive. Try expressing your legitimate need for attention. It might work!Catherine, 58 Jim is entitled to time alone, but Marlene feels left out, so there must also be activities involving her that can help him switch off – they should make an effort to spend time together in ways they both enjoy. Solo late-night gaming is great fun though. I think Jim is innocent.Matt, 21 Jim should understand that his video game enthusiasm is hardly the most healthy pursuit; and after all, Marlene is only asking him to ration his game playing. Hopefully the lighter, warmer evenings will make staring at a screen a little less attractive for Jim. Guilty.Anouk, 42 I’m a gamer but not obsessive about it because I like physical activities more. Marlene is being reasonable and Jim would do well to listen to her.Tiffany, 29 So now you can be the judge. In our poll below, tell us: should Jim spend less time playing video games?

4/29/2022,"What happens when the league’s tragicomedy franchise hands a market-resetting contract to a middling receiver? Lunacy. Absolute lunacy. The stench of the four-year, $72m deal that the Jaguars handed to Christian Kirk in the opening hours of free agency wafted through the halls of Vegas during the first round of the NFL draft on Thursday. Someday soon, we’ll look back on the Kirk signing as the first domino that injected chaos into the NFL’s carefully calibrated ecosystem – a sliding doors moment that will swing divisional races, title games and that most vapid of terms: Legacies. Ever since Jacksonville signed Kirk, the league’s wide receiver market had turned gaga. Do you pay your star receiver? Do you not? If you don’t, will he play? Is it better to try to recreate your star’s success in the aggregate with a couple of cheap rookies or tie him down to a long-term deal that absorbs an eye-watering percentage of the salary cap? For the better part of a month, superstar receivers have taken the answers into their hands, eyeing the contract first and figuring out which team will hand it to them later. The names of players who’ve moved read like a who’s who of the All-Pro ballot. First, there was Green Bay dealing Davante Adams to the Raiders. The Tyreek Hill-to-Miami deal followed. On draft night, Titans star AJ Brown joined the growing list of Big Name Receivers On The Move – the Titans trading Brown to the Eagles for a first-round pick. All signed record-shattering deals as soon as their moves were finalized. The Ravens jumped into the game, too, sending Hollywood Brown to the Cardinals for a late first-round pick, a move that wasn’t exactly endorsed by quarterback Lamar Jackson. Meanwhile, the specter of a Deebo Samuel trade hung over the evening: Teams battled up against the clock as they tried to chuck a package at the Niners that would tempt them into dealing away unique talent away. Samuel may still be traded before the end of the draft. And if not him, then perhaps DK Metcalf or Terry McLaurin. Any trade feels plausible. It’s not just the veteran market that the Kirk deal has distorted, either. The gold rush among the league’s star receivers has forced a re-assessing of the value of receivers in the draft. Over the past half-decade, the idea of taking a receiver early in the draft has felt like overkill. There are so many gifted pass-catchers being churned out by the college system that the value was in throwing as many darts at the dartboard in the middle rounds as possible – the Packers have still not taken a receiver in the first round for 20 years, despite Aaron Rodgers’ persistent groaning. On Thursday night, the league set to work tilting that logic on its head. Any rookie deal represents value over a $20m-per-year deal for a veteran. So why not offer a pick or two to move up to land the receiver of your choice? The Titans used the pick they received from the AJ Brown trade to select Arkansas receiver Treylon Burks, a comparative talent who will cost a fraction of the price of what Brown will earn in Philly. The league has split into two worlds: You’re either trading away a star receiver or looking to acquire one, whether that’s digging into the veteran market or trying to vault up the draft order. The Lions and Saints both pushed their way up the first-round pecking order despite having pressing needs elsewhere on their rosters – most notably at quarterback. The Lions handed over future picks to move up to grab Alabama speedster Jameson Williams, landing a big-play receiver before they considered finding someone who could throw him the ball. Jameson Williams' longest receptions per game: 94, 18, 29, 81, 26, 32, 75, 65, 58, 50, 79, 34, 67, 20, 40. You read that right. That’s 8 games with a reception over 50 yards; 6 games with a reception over 70 yards. And those are the ones he caught.https://t.co/OA7hgWbfA2 This is the new way of doing things. The state and style of the college game lends itself to an increasing number of receivers entering the draft. The specific mechanics of the route trees in college and the pros have started to blend, making it easier for a rookie receiver to make an instant impact at the next level. As NFL teams have shifted away from rhythm and timing-based offenses into systems based around pace-and-space, the goal has been to find receivers who can do damage with the ball in their hand after the catch, or who have the speed to tilt the defense in such a way pre-snap that life is all sorts of easy for the quarterback once the ball is in play. It was a night in which quarterbacks were overlooked in favor of the protectors who could buy an extra beat in order to push the ball downfield, or the athletes who could turn simple completions into chunk yardage; only the Steelers took a shot on a quarterback in the first round, waiting until the 20th pick to select Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett. In total, six receivers were selected within the first 18 picks. That means that nine first-round choices were used this year on receivers, either selected by a team or traded for one of the wantaway stars. Across the league, decision-makers continue to take giant swings in the name of scoring points. Moderation is out; excess is en vogue. And it’s not only receiver specific. Teams have become more freewheelin’ with their once oh-so-precious draft picks. Nine trades were orchestrated on draft night. Twenty-seven total first-round picks were traded in the end. Two picks were traded three separate times, with teams jockeying to ensure they withdrew maximum value from their draft slot. We have the Rams to thank for the shifting mindset. The NFL, as the cliché goes, is a copycat league. The post-process era of draft pick fetishization birthed a market inefficiency. Draft picks were overvalued (draft picks can be anything!). Rams’ head honcho Les Snead built a champion with a dose of humility: He recognized that he couldn’t accurately identify the finest college prospects at a higher clip than his peers. He embraced what he did not know – and chased certainty. Snead decided that it was better to deploy his most valuable assets to secure known commodities rather than guessing on prospects, swinging big trades for Jalen Ramsey, Matthew Stafford and Von Miller, three of the Rams’ most crucial contributors during their Super Bowl run. That same mindset has filtered around the league. Some have channeled the chase-a-proven-quarterback route. Others have forked over a gaggle of picks to chase receivers who could put them over the top. Some have inverted the Snead mindset, pouring draft picks into packages in order to move up in the draft to focus in on Their Guy™, regardless of the perceived positional value or their starting spot when the opening round of the draft first began. Teams used to hoard draft picks like a squirrel preparing for winter. Now, the league has gone full Oprah. You get a draft pick! And you get a draft pick! As the timelines for teams – the executives, coaches, fans – fray, the notion of meticulous, long-term building is going the way of the dodo. Reckless abandon is in. If you don’t win within two years, you’re in trouble; it’s best to try to microwave some success. Who knows, grab yourself a top young quarterback and hand him his receiver buddy and you might ride that magic all the way to an unlikely Super Bowl run. Whenever there’s a draft class that lacks high-level quarterback prospects, the opening night of the draft tends to be a dud, one reserved for the evaluation geeks. But who knew that all that was needed to light a fire under such a year was an under-fire general manager handing a desperate contract to a so-so receiver.",Sport/Sport,The NFL’s gaga receiver market is the straw that’s stirring this year’s draft,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/29/nfl-draft-wide-receivers-analysis-picks-first-round
4/29/2022,"“Oh crikey, what can I get for Harriet?” asked an ad in this newspaper three days before Christmas 1992. Alongside images of albums by Enya, Prince, Madonna and REM was one featuring the silhouette of a praying woman and a little-known name not usually featured alongside these multimillion selling artists: Henryk Górecki. The album in question featured a recording of Górecki’s Symphony No 3, Symphony of Sorrowful Songs, a 55-minute work for orchestra and soprano written in 1976. Its three movements, all slow, set Polish texts that reflect on motherhood, religion and death, including a prayer that was inscribed on a wall in the Gestapo’s headquarters in Zakopane by an 18-year-old female prisoner. Unsurprisingly, the recording did not start life intending to keep the company of Madonna and Prince – but in late 1992 the symphony was soaring high. For 11 weeks it was among the 40 bestselling albums in the UK, peaking at No 6 in early February 1993, in between Paul McCartney’s Off the Ground and REM’s Automatic for the People. It topped the classical charts on both sides of the Atlantic, and total sales today have surpassed 1m – an unthinkable and still unique figure in contemporary classical music. Thirty years on from its April 1992 release, the album’s ascent is the stuff of legend. Górecki, born in 1933, started out writing dissonant, complex and uncommercial music, as was expected of avant-garde composers at the time. His change of heart in the mid-70s – towards a simpler, more spiritually inclined style – was not a ploy to hit the mainstream. In fact, this shift simply alienated him from his peers: the Third Symphony was a flop on its 1977 premiere. But in 1985, David Drew of the music publishers Boosey & Hawkes chanced upon Górecki at a Warsaw music festival. Back home, he listened, rapt, to an early Polish recording of the Third Symphony. Thanks to Drew’s enthusiasm, in 1989 the London Sinfonietta organised a weekend-long concert series featuring music by both Górecki and the Soviet composer Alfred Schnittke. Robert Hurwitz, then president of the US label Nonesuch (part of the Warner stable), flew over for the weekend. He too had already heard and enjoyed a recording of the Third Symphony – and, considering that version “perfectly fine”, had no plans to record it again. He was more interested in other works on the bill: “The Third Symphony was kind of a bonus for the weekend,” he says. An overwhelmingly powerful live performance – the work’s London premiere – with the soprano Margaret Field and conducted by David Atherton, changed his mind. The critics agreed. “The most imposing work [of the programmes] was Górecki’s Symphony No 3, which drew together many strands in his musical personality. An impressive individual musical statement,” wrote the Guardian’s Meirion Bowen. “The astonishing Third Symphony … at almost an hour of very slow music, could have become a trial, and for some it evidently did. I can only say that I found it made an intensely physical impact, with its relentless tread and its piercingly simple melodic lines,” wrote Nicholas Kenyon in the Observer. “It really did feel like a major event,” says Janis Susskind, who has worked at Boosey for 40 years and is now managing director. “You could just see the planets coming into alignment, that there was potential for getting this remarkable symphony to a bigger audience.” Nonesuch’s subsequent recording featured the Sinfonietta (which, as was the norm for such projects, was paid a one-off fee rather than receiving royalties), with the conductor David Zinman and the emerging US soprano Dawn Upshaw, whose piercingly pure vocal tone contrasted with earlier renditions. “After the sessions, I thought: ‘This is better than I anticipated,’” Hurwitz recalls. “‘I think it could be a success; we might even sell 25,000 copies.’” That the album went on to sell 40 times that number was way beyond the dreams of anyone involved. The then new commercial radio station Classic FM helped play a part. It had launched in September 1992 and immediately put the symphony’s shortest movement, the second, on heavy rotation. The recording touched a nerve. “Suddenly it was reaching music lovers and listeners, jumping over the heads of the gatekeepers,” says Susskind. “It was thrilling, actually. In classical music publishing you don’t get supernovas – and this was a supernova.” The work has retained its place in popular culture. A recent recording featured Beth Gibbons from the band Portishead, and its strains have graced film soundtracks from The Tree of Life to Suicide Squad. Now it’s about to become an opera of sorts – English National Opera has just announced a staging of the symphony, directed and designed by Isabella Bywater, will be at the Coliseum in London in April 2023. Górecki’s symphony was not completely alone aesthetically. Several other contemporary composers, including Arvo Pärt and John Tavener, displayed a similarly spiritual bent (their music was sometimes known as “holy minimalism”), and minimalists such as Steve Reich had already disrupted the status quo. But only Górecki’s album sold in such numbers: a new classical mainstream did not emerge. “For me the success of the Third Symphony was an isolated phenomenon,” says the Guardian’s chief classical critic, Andrew Clements. “It just caught on, almost like a novelty record.” Kenyon puts it thus: “What first minimalism and then these pieces” – such as Pärt’s Passio and Tavener’s The Protecting Veil – “did was to show that there were other directions in classical music: there wasn’t going to be a mainstream any more.” Although appreciative of his success, Górecki had the mixed feelings typical of a one-hit wonder – yet he understood the impact of his hit. In a 1993 Time magazine interview, he reflected: “Perhaps people, especially young people, find something they need in this piece of music, something they are seeking.” Appearing on National Public Radio in the US in 1995, he read from a letter from a 14-year-old Swedish girl who suffered serious burns and lost her mother in a fire. She cherished her Górecki tapes. “I live only because you write such music,” she wrote. As for Hurwitz, his passion still evident after 30 years. “In terms of its text and its hyper-emotional language, it could have been written today, about what is happening to the nextdoor neighbour of Górecki’s Poland,” he says. “What moment is there more need for sorrowful songs than right now?’ ENO’s Symphony of Sorrowful Songs is at the Coliseum, London, from 27 April to 5 May 2023.

4/29/2022,"The Victorian state crossbench MP Fiona Patten says she will re-evaluate her relationship with the Andrews government after federal Labor placed Derryn Hinch’s Justice party and the Liberal Democrats above her party on Senate how-to-vote cards. Labor’s how-to-vote card for the Senate in Victoria instructs supporters to place the Greens second on their ballot paper, followed by Derryn Hinch’s Justice party, the Liberal Democrats, the Animal Justice party and the Reason party, of which Patten is leader. She described the move as “surprising”, given the Victorian Labor government has come to rely on her support, along with that of the Animal Justice party MP, Andy Meddick, and the Greens leader, Samantha Ratnam, to pass legislation in the upper house. “You can imagine how disappointed I was to see that the relationship that we had built through very tough times was not reflected in their preferences at a federal level in this state,” Patten told Guardian Australia. “I am taking this personally. It does make me question the relationship that I thought we had.” Patten, Meddick and Ratnam were instrumental in helping the Victorian government extend its state of emergency powers and later worked with the health minister to draft pandemic-specific legislation. The trio received death threats due to their support for the laws. Patten said the Liberal Democrat David Limbrick, who vacated his seat in the Victorian upper house to run at the top of his party’s Senate ticket, “accused Daniel Andrews and the Labor government of being dictators”. “They’re recommending that their voters vote for David Limbrick before they vote for Reason. In what world would that seem logical?” Patten said. “They couldn’t work with him at a state level, but they reckon they’ll be able to work with him at a federal level. Is that what they’re trying to tell us?” Reason has placed Labor third on its how-to-vote card for the Senate in New South Wales and fifth in Victoria, behind the Animal Justice party, the Greens and the Fusion party. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Limbrick said both Labor and the Liberals had placed the Liberal Democrats at four on how-to-vote cards, although he was surprised by the former’s decision to do so. “Maybe they really want me out of state politics, I don’t know. Maybe they prefer their federal counterparts to deal with me than state government,” he said, adding the Liberal Democrats were yet to publish their how-to-vote cards. A spokesperson for Meddick said he was disappointed by Labor’s decision but noted there was a difference between state and federal branches. “Of course, we’d always like to be higher. Elections are a tough game and sometimes we don’t always come out on top of those negotiations, but our primary focus now moving forward is just getting as high a primary vote as we possibly can,” she said. “Victorians can choose their own preferences and they don’t need to follow a how-to-vote card.” In 2016, the Senate voting system was changed to remove the use of group voting tickets and to require voters to allocate six or more preferences above the line or 12 or more below the line on the ballot paper.
