5/20/2022,"Bob Neuwirth had a career as a singer, songwriter and visual artist that lasted six decades, but nothing he achieved in those guises could erase the dominant memory of his presence as Bob Dylan’s sidekick, accomplice, henchman and licensed provocateur during the time in the 1960s when Dylan was emerging from the folk scene, conquering the world and trying to work out how to deal with his popularity in ways that were not always pretty to observe. Most symbolically, Neuwirth, who has died aged 82, was the headless figure in black jeans and an orange-and-white striped T-shirt, a camera dangling from his hand, standing behind an inscrutable Dylan in Daniel Kramer’s photograph on the cover of Highway 61 Revisited, the 1965 album that included Like a Rolling Stone and Desolation Row. During what Dylan’s biographer Clinton Heylin called his “amphetamine years”, when the young star’s entourage kept the straight world at bay while sending it up at every opportunity, Neuwirth was always alongside him, the hippest of the hip. He was in the background of the famous video for Dylan’s Subterranean Homesick Blues, shot in an alley near the Savoy hotel in London; while the singer peels off cards inscribed with phrases from the song’s verses, Neuwirth stands in the background, chatting to the poet Allen Ginsberg. In a notorious scene from Don’t Look Back, the documentary made by DA Pennebaker of Dylan’s 1965 European tour, Neuwirth insults Joan Baez, Dylan’s increasingly insecure lover and travelling companion. By making it clear that her time is up, he is doing his friend’s dirty work for him, while Dylan sits at a typewriter, impassively tapping out his novel. At such a moment the description of Neuwirth by another Dylan biographer, Daniel Mark Epstein, seems generous: “The master of the revels – handsome, quick-witted and ruthless, he could cut someone to shreds with a well-timed insult or put-down, and then rescue them with a puckish smile.” Suze Rotolo, Baez’s predecessor in Dylan’s affections, remembered that Neuwirth and Dylan could lower the temperature of a room by 30 degrees just by staring from behind their impenetrable shades. Born in Akron, Ohio, the son of Clara (nee Fischer) and Robert Neuwirth, Bob attended the school of the Museum of Fine Art in Boston, and had become a familiar figure as a singer and guitarist in local clubs when he met Dylan at the Indian Neck folk festival in Branford, Connecticut, in 1961. Like the rest of the audience, he was impressed by the unknown 19-year-old’s confident and committed performance of a handful of Woody Guthrie songs. Before long, Neuwirth was in Greenwich Village, becoming the male friend Dylan always seemed to need close to him in those early days. He was at the Newport folk festival in 1965, when Dylan provoked fury among purists by singing with an electric blues band. In turn, Neuwirth would be supplanted as the chosen male kindred spirit by Robbie Robertson, the guitarist with the Hawks, the band Dylan took on a world tour the following year. In 1965 Neuwirth had introduced Dylan to Edie Sedgwick, one of Andy Warhol’s “superstars”. Together they encouraged her to leave the world of Warhol and the Factory, but it was Neuwirth who had the significant affair with the waif-like model and actor, even though some of Dylan’s songs of the period, including Just Like a Woman, were assumed to be about her. After falling out of Dylan’s orbit during the singer’s retreat from public life following a motorcycle accident in 1966, Neuwirth made his first solo album for David Geffen’s Asylum label in 1970. Like its several successors, recorded at intervals over the next 25 years (including Last Day on Earth, recorded with John Cale), it made little impact. Neuwirth co-wrote the song Mercedes Benz with his friend Janis Joplin during a drinking session in a New York bar, when she began singing a line by the beat poet Michael McClure. He also taught her Kris Kristofferson’s Me and Bobby McGee, and she recorded both songs a few days before her death in 1970, for inclusion on an album, Pearl, released early the following year. He returned to Dylan’s world in 1975 as an integral part of the Rolling Thunder Revue, helping put together the band – including T Bone Burnett and David Mansfield – that travelled the east coast of the US and Canada, playing the shows and shooting the scenes that appeared in Renaldo & Clara, Dylan’s debut as a film director. He was given a spot of his own in the show, and some nights he would add harmonies to Dylan’s When I Paint My Masterpiece. In 1999 he took part in concerts arranged by the producer Hal Willner at a Brooklyn church and the Royal Festival Hall in London to celebrate the music collected on Harry Smith’s Anthology of American Folk Music half a century earlier. The following year he produced a film called Down from the Mountain, directed by Pennebaker and featuring the musicians whose songs had been heard in Joel and Ethan Coen’s O Brother, Where Art Thou? A follow-up, called The Great High Mountain, also drew on the music from Anthony Minghella’s film Cold Mountain. Neuwirth was among those interviewed by Martin Scorsese for his biographical documentary on Dylan, No Direction Home, in 2005. His later years were largely devoted to painting in a studio in New York’s meatpacking district. He is survived by his partner, Paula Batson.

5/20/2022,"Brighton are playing with house money as they have already set a club record Premier League points tally. They sit just inside the top half on 48 points and will be very keen to avoid being knocked out by Brentford, Crystal Palace, Newcastle and Aston Villa. A win against West Ham seals the deal and a point might do the trick but with four teams chasing it might be wise for Graham Potter’s side to go all guns blazing. They could even jump as high as eighth if results go their way. David Moyes is likely to deploy similar tactics as West Ham will be eager to overhaul Manchester United in sixth and qualify for the Europa League. The form book lies in Brighton’s favour, though, as the Hammers have one win, one draw and five defeats from seven away games in 2022.

5/20/2022,"With his breakthrough feature, Bait, in 2019, Cornish film-maker Mark Jenkin showed himself a bold experimentalist, the creator of a daringly strange expressionist cinema. It was a minimalist piece of work in black and white with the aesthetic of a silent film or even a home movie – shot on 16mm and developed by hand. Now he has refined and developed this unique, stripped-down style for an eerie prose-poem of a movie about loneliness: Enys Men – the last word is pronounced “mane”, and in Cornish means “stone island”. It has the same almost primitive texture: the film itself feels like a hard, wizened, weatherbeaten object, like those seen on screen. Long stretches will go past entirely wordlessly, with ambient sea-spray sound and closeups on stones or cups, or the dial of the old two-way radio with which contact is maintained with the outside world. But it is far from restful. The mood is strange, always picking up on some disturbance in the ether, with sudden, deafening stabs of sound. Enys Men is shot in colour of a fierce, rich sort, and looks as if it was made in the year it is set: 1973. It is not exactly a horror film, despite some spasms of disquiet, but an uncanny evocation of how, when left utterly on our own, we spiral inwards into our memories, dreams and fears. Mary Woodvine (who was the well-off landlady in Bait) plays a woman living on a remote Cornish island, in a simple cottage whose future condition of moss-covered dereliction she appears to foretell or hallucinate. She is apparently researching the state of some wildflowers at the cliff-edge, every day inspecting their condition and taking their soil temperature, and solemnly recording the unvarying results in pencil in a ledger. Every day after doing this, she has got into the superstitious habit of dropping a stone into the shaft of an abandoned tin-mine and listening for the faint splash. At night, she listens to a crackling transistor radio and reads a copy of the environmental tract A Blueprint for Survival by Teddy Goldsmith. She is dependent on a petrol generator for power at this rudimentary place; this petrol delivered by a local man, played by Edward Rowe. This woman remembers a past sexual relationship with him, or perhaps fantasises a future one, and she is also plagued with memory-apparitions of a troubled younger woman (Flo Crowe). Her daughter? Her younger self? This woman’s steady state of hermit-like seclusion is disrupted when she sees lichen emerging from a flower and finds lichen growing on her own skin. She has visions, perhaps of dead miners or lifeboatmen, and also of an elderly priest, singing the hymn Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy, with its request to send a light to save “some poor fainting, struggling seaman”. He is played by Woodvine’s father, the distinguished Shakespearean actor John Woodvine. This is not a scary film in the generic sense but there is something unsettling in the simple spectacle of solitude: no company, no television, no shopping, no diversions. In 2022, it seems starker still. All alone on an island, no smartphone in your pocket, nothing but the pencil to make notes about flowers. It’s a situation that forces you to look in on yourself, and that indeed will take you to the brink of something that feels like madness. Jenkin’s style is so unusual, so unadorned, it feels almost like a manuscript culture of cinema. There is real artistry in it.

5/20/2022,"In the course of the next few days, Priti Patel will make the most important ruling on free speech made by any home secretary in recent memory. She must resolve whether to comply with a US request to extradite Julian Assange on espionage charges. The consequences for Assange will be profound. Once in the US he will almost certainly be sent to a maximum-security prison for the rest of his life. He will die in jail. The impact on British journalism will also be profound. It will become lethally dangerous to handle, let alone publish, documents from US government sources. Reporters who do so, and their editors, will risk the same fate as Assange and become subject to extradition followed by lifelong incarceration. For this reason Daniel Ellsberg, the 91-year-old US whistleblower who was prosecuted for his role in the Pentagon Papers revelations, which exposed the covert bombing of Laos and Cambodia and thus helped end the Vietnam war, has given eloquent testimony in Assange’s defence. He told an extradition hearing two years ago that he felt a “great identification” with Assange, adding that his revelations were among the most important in the history of the US. The US government does not agree. It maintains that Assange was effectively a spy and not a reporter, and should be punished accordingly. Up to a point this position is understandable. Assange was anything but an ordinary journalist. His deep understanding of computers and how they could be hacked singled him out from the professionally shambolic arts graduates who normally rise to eminence in newspapers. The ultimate creature of the internet age, in 2006 he helped found WikiLeaks, an organisation that specialises in obtaining and releasing classified or secret documents, infuriating governments and corporations around the world. The clash with the US came in 2010, when (in collaboration with the Guardian, Der Spiegel, Le Monde, the New York Times and other international news organisations) WikiLeaks entered into one of the great partnerships of the modern era in any field. It started publishing documents supplied by the US army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. Between them, WikiLeaks and Manning were responsible for a series of first-class scoops that any self-respecting reporter would die for. And these scoops were not the tittle-tattle that comprises the daily fodder of most journalism. They were of overwhelming global importance, reshaping our understanding of the Iraq war and the “war on terror”. To give one example among thousands, WikiLeaks published a video of soldiers in a US helicopter laughing as they shot and killed unarmed civilians in Iraq – including a Reuters photographer and his assistant. (The US military refused to discipline the perpetrators.) To the intense embarrassment of the US, WikiLeaks revealed that the total number of civilian casualties in Iraq was 66,000 – far more than the US had acknowledged. It shone an appalling new light on the abuse meted out to the Muslim inmates at Guantánamo Bay, including the revelation that 150 innocent people were held for years without charge. Clive Stafford Smith, the then chairman of the human rights charity Reprieve who represented 84 Guantánamo prisoners, praised the way WikiLeaks helped him to establish that charges against his clients were fabricated. It’s easy to see why the US launched a criminal investigation. Then events took an unexpected turn in November 2010 when Sweden issued an arrest warrant against Assange following allegations of sexual misconduct. Assange refused to go to Sweden, apparently on the grounds that this was a pretext for his extradition to the United States and took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Sweden never charged Assange with an offence, and dropped its investigation in 2019. This was an eventful year in the Assange story. Ecuador kicked him out of the embassy and he was promptly arrested for breaching bail: he’s languished for the past three years in Belmarsh prison. Meanwhile the US pursues him using the same 1917 Espionage Act under which Ellsberg was unsuccessfully prosecuted. Assange’s defence, led by the solicitor Gareth Peirce and Edward Fitzgerald QC, has argued that his only crime was the crime of investigative journalism. They point out that the indictment charges Assange with actions, such as protecting sources, that are basic journalistic practice: the US alleges that “Assange and Manning took measures to conceal Manning as the source of the disclosure of classified records”. Any journalist who failed to take this elementary precaution when supplied with information by a source would be sacked. The US stated that Assange “actively encouraged Manning” to provide the information. How disgraceful! No wonder Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, has warned that: “It is dangerous to suggest that these actions are somehow criminal rather than steps routinely taken by investigative journalists who communicate with confidential sources to receive classified information of public importance.” Despite all this, there’s no reason to suppose that Patel will come to Assange’s rescue – though there may yet be further legal ways to fight extradition. Even if Patel wasn’t already on the way to winning the all-corners record as the most repressive home secretary in modern history, the Johnson government, already in Joe Biden’s bad books, has no incentive to further alienate the US president. If and when Assange is put on a plane to the US, investigative journalism will suffer a permanent and deadening blow. And the message will be sent to war criminals not just in the US but in every country round the globe that they can commit their crimes with impunity. Peter Oborne is a journalist and author.

5/20/2022,"The person was sick when they boarded the plane. Five days before leaving Nigeria for Britain, they noticed a rash that spread into a scattering of fluid-filled bumps. When the plane touched down on 4 May, they wasted no time. The person attended hospital where doctors, alerted by their recent travel, immediately suspected monkeypox. The patient was isolated and a doctor, clad in full PPE, took a swab from a blister on their skin. Because monkeypox is listed as a “high-consequence infectious disease”, the situation moved fast. The sample was sent to Porton Down science park in Wiltshire where the UK Health Security Agency’s rare and imported pathogens laboratory swiftly ran a PCR test. This confirmed the infection, which the agency announced the next day, on 7 May. Sporadic cases of monkeypox are rare, but not new in Britain. In total, seven cases have been recorded, in 2018, 2019 and 2021, all linked to travel to Nigeria where monkeypox is endemic. But as public health officials were soon to discover, this year was to be different. For the first time, doctors have uncovered chains of transmission in the community – not only in Britain – among people with no known links to travel. The UK has confirmed 20 cases, but more than 100 known or suspected cases are under investigation in the US, Canada, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Sweden and Australia. “It’s come into the UK, it’s come into other countries, and now we have to deal with it and figure out what’s going on,” said Prof David Heymann, distinguished fellow at the Chatham House global health programme and former executive director of the communicable diseases cluster for the World Health Organization. Monkeypox is a viral infection that most people shrug off. There are two forms. The more serious is the central African or Congo strain. The latest cases involve the milder west Africa strain. Data from Africa suggest about 1% of people with cases die. The concern is less around the impact on healthy people, but on the vulnerable – those with weakened immune systems, for example – and on the virus spreading in healthcare settings. Despite its name – the virus was first detected in macaques – most human cases of monkeypox are believed to come from contact with other infected animals, such as rodents. Historically, transmission between humans has been limited – infections sometimes spread in homes but soon fizzle out. The virus spreads through large respiratory droplets, calling for prolonged or frequent face-to-face contact, or contact with body fluids such as saliva, or skin lesions, either directly or through contaminated sheets, towels and other items. A week after confirming the first patient, the UKHSA reported two more in a family in London, with no links to the first case. The announcement on Saturday 14 May was “crucial” according to one doctor, because it carried images of monkeypox lesions. These were seen by specialists struggling to diagnose patients with unexplained rashes at sexual health clinics. They immediately sent swabs to Porton Down, which confirmed the cases as monkeypox. On the Monday, the health agency confirmed four more cases, all men who have sex with men and appeared to have caught the virus in London. The increase in mostly unrelated cases prompted the UK’s chief medical officers to send immediate advice to healthcare workers via the NHS central alerting system. It called on providers to ensure they had sufficient PPE to assess and treat patients and noted that the smallpox vaccine, Imvanex, offered some protection against monkeypox if given soon after exposure. The vaccine is already being offered to healthcare workers and contacts of cases at high risk of infection, and the Department of Health has secured thousands of doses in case the outbreak grows. The alert put the spotlight on men who have sex with men (MSM), and a flurry of cases have since been confirmed. While public health experts rush to contain the outbreak, they warn against focusing on any particular group. “This could easily have popped up in a different context,” said one senior specialist in sexual health. “The MSM phenomena may well have been a very quick way to have drawn our attention to there being skin-to-skin transmission in the community.” Sir Ali Zumla, professor of infectious diseases and international health at University College London, said focusing on men who have sex with men was “prejudicial, unfair and stigmatising”, adding that clusters of monkeypox would occur in any group in close contact with infected people. It was “highly unlikely” that the clusters were due to any change in the virus, he added. Dr Meera Chand, director of clinical and emerging infections at the UKHSA, said “everyone” should be alert to monkeypox symptoms. “If you notice any unusual rashes or lesions consistent with monkeypox, please contact NHS 111 or a sexual health service, calling ahead before your visit. A notable proportion of recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men, which is why we are particularly encouraging them to be alert to the symptoms. We are working to trace contacts of cases and offering vaccination where appropriate, and meanwhile we are rapidly investigating how the virus is transmitting to understand why we are seeing this unusual outbreak.”",News/World news,‘Now we have to deal with it’: what’s going on in the UK with monkeypox?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/now-we-have-to-deal-with-it-whats-going-on-in-the-uk-with-monkeypox
5/20/2022,"I am writing as the CEO of LIVE, the trade body for the UK’s live music industry, to express my disappointment in the headline and tone of your article (Dear Coldplay, listen to Massive Attack and save yourselves from greenwashing, 11 May). As it sets out, decarbonising live music is a vital but daunting task. The sector has made significant progress over recent years. The article notes that Coldplay’s tour would generate 50% lower emissions than the last and called the band’s efforts “an admirable step down the path to zero-emissions music”. Why then, does it take such a swipe at an industry that is, while by no means perfect, putting its shoulder to the wheel of environmental progress? If perfect is the enemy of good, then we are left in a position that can, all too often, lead to paralysis.

To make the icing, mix the instant coffee with 20ml hot water and leave to sit for a few minutes. Stir this into the sifted icing sugar until the mixture is homogeneous and thick. (If it’s too runny, add some more icing sugar; and if too thick, add a touch more water.) Drizzle the icing over the cake, leave to set for 10 minutes, then dust with cocoa powder, slice and serve.

5/20/2022,"Browse the makeup sections of Aldi, Lidl, Primark and many more, and it won’t be long before you come across “dupes”. Immensely popular with generation Z, these are near “duplicates” of luxury items created by budget brands. Copyright issues aside, how ethical are they? I spoke to Tansy Hoskins, whose books dissect the impact of fast fashion. I’ll never forget being a teenager and discovering my Reeboks were actually knock-off “Reeborks”. The shame! Aren’t dupes fakes by another name?I’d say dupes are a close relative of fakes but, crucially, they’re within the legal boundaries. Which may explain why makeup dupes are more popular than black-market cosmetics where you can’t be sure if ingredients are safe. Interestingly, in clothing Zara recently accused Shein of duping their designs. Though Zara has faced charges of copying, too.Fashion is about getting inspiration from the world around you. So I don’t think it would be possible to get rid of dupes altogether. They seem accepted: magazines and influencers speak about them. It’s as if everyone’s realised the price of designer items is rarely about the materials and labour that go into them. Some dupes are made by the same factories as the “originals”. Buying them is hacking the system, scamming the scammers …The idea of luxury is definitely a scam. The lipstick you buy from a designer brand could be nearly identical to a high-street one, but because you’ve seen the designer’s couture dress at the Met Gala you buy it. That’s how they make their money – sunglasses, belts. They don’t sell many couture dresses. Most aren’t making their own perfume either. A multinational like Coty is, and the name is licensed. So does this mean dupes aren’t any less ethical?If you are buying any new piece of clothing for £5, it’s likely the true cost is being paid by a garment worker. And the environmental sustainability of that garment is probably nonexistent. I’m not blaming people for buying dupes. The industry is cruel in creating desire when people can’t afford it. How can we find out how something is made?Big brands publish their factory lists. Start with the country label, then read country reports and find out hourly rates of pay, maternity pay, etc. Getting to a specific factory is hard. You can ask questions of independent sellers, and I use Panjiva, a supply-chain intelligence subscription service. That’s way too involved for the average person.I agree! The emphasis shouldn’t be on consumers. It shouldn’t even be legal to release products made by Syrian refugee children, or that have destroyed the Amazon. Ethically, there’s no match for “buying nothing”. That’s the only way out of the trends madness.If we judge our clothes on use value – how warm it keeps you, etc – we have more than we would ever need. Widen that to the clothes in our community, and with clothes swaps and upcycling, we could stop producing right now. A new look every season, but only second hand. Challenge accepted!Right – forget dupes, and create our own trends! I reject the idea that a small cabal of people in New York, Paris, London and Milan know what is beautiful. Let’s create an explosion in real creativity, where everybody’s ideas of what is beautiful matter.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Are knock-off fashion ‘dupes’ unethical?

5/20/2022,"News that the Partygate investigation has concluded with no further fines for Boris Johnson is arguably a setback for long-game prime ministerial assassin Dominic Cummings. The stop-Boris movement’s trackie-bummed antihero now has to regather, regroup and confront his own reflection in the bathroom mirror with the timeworn war cry: “We go again.” At this point, I don’t even know what you’d call this movie. Day 396 of the Jackal? Anyway, signs of a healthy politics: an MP from the governing party is arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of rape, sexual assault, indecent assault, abuse of position of trust and misconduct in a public office – but it’s basically been forgotten about by Friday on account of the police confirming the end of their investigation into pandemic lawbreaking by the people who made those laws. The cops confirm the most-fined address in the entire country is No 10 Downing Street. MPs cheerily tell reporters that all that is now “priced in” to their continued support for the PM, with the next big test being two byelections – one held because the previous MP repeatedly watched porn in the Commons chamber, and the other held because the previous MP was recently convicted of child sexual assault. The justice secretary goes on telly this morning – hey, it’s crime week! – to claim that people just want to see the government get on with the job. I don’t mean to have lost focus, but remind us what “the job” was again? It feels a bit like we’ve passed the tipping point, and that all this other stuff is now so prevalent as to effectively constitute “the job”. You clock in for a shift of lawbreaking or defending lawbreaking. But if you want to do frivolous things like solve ordinary people’s problems, then, I’m sorry – you do that on your own time. This here is a shirkplace, not a workplace. Either way, Downing Street has responded to the end of the Met investigation the best way it knows how: with an internal reorganisation in which some people who previously reported to some other people are now reporting to some different people. Yup, it’s another Downing Street shakeup. We go again! Johnson’s No 10 gets shaken up more than a snowglobe. Or maybe think of it as a kaleidoscope full of shit, endlessly resolving itself into new and different vistas. Which are all, inescapably, still made of shit. According to some readings, Johnson seems to have escaped further fines based on the defence that he works at home – a thing that, in all other contexts, he tells us is very bad. Indeed, the media campaign to force Britons to stop working from home and return to the office continues unrelentingly. As I said this week, Rupert Murdoch is positively obsessed with people returning to their commutes. And, as Cummings confirmed this week, the chief drivers of the anti-WFH push are the newspaper editors and proprietors who constantly harangue Johnson about what it’s doing to their sales. If only the PM could be straight with the public and explain that they should herd themselves back to the office in order to save Fleet Street. As tugs on the electoral heartstrings go, it’s up there with telling them to do it to save buy-to-let landlords or serial sex killers. Any bright spots this week? Yes and no. It’s been a mixed bag for former knitwear unicorn Rishi Sunak. On the one hand, the chancellor has just made his debut on the Sunday Times rich list, with his and his wife’s wealth estimated at £730m. (The Sunaks’ fortune is put down to her huge stake in Infosys, and his huge mistake in not taxing her on the dividends.) On the other hand, his previously booming personal brand continues to crash like a stablecoin. The chancellor’s approval rating is now believed to be pegged to Franklin Mint items, or TalkTV’s ratings. Sunak’s not even being taken seriously by the CBI. On Wednesday, the chancellor attended the confederation’s annual dinner in the City and gave a speech that went down like a vial of monkeypox. It appears that opening your remarks with the words “Let me tell you the plan”, and then not having a plan, much less telling the audience about it, is not the way the “party of business” is expected to behave. As one business leader in attendance put it on departure, he was “more worried now than when I came in”. Justifiably. Even the government’s position on a windfall tax on energy companies is subject to a paralysing tug-of-hate between government factions, with Sunak warming to the idea but No 10’s deputy chief of staff, David Canzini, adamantly opposed, apparently on the basis that it is an “ideologically unconservative” thing to do. I remember a Tory party conference four years ago where Jacob Rees-Mogg was telling people not to panic at the Brexit chaos, on the basis that Brexit would be a success “because it is a Conservative thing to be doing”. You’ve heard of fiddling while Rome burned; our version of that seems to be the country sliding into the howling hellfires while various government figures twat about on the side of the pit debating whether it would or would not be “Conservative” to help. Or maybe whether the most helpful thing possible would just be to sell Channel 4. As indicated earlier: shitty vistas all round. In fact, a few more months into the cost-of-living crisis and you get the feeling Johnson will be begging to go back to the sunlit uplands of Partygate.

5/20/2022,"Rebel Wilson has claimed that a male co-star sexually harassed her. In an interview with People, the Pitch Perfect and Cats star had said that the incident occurred before #MeToo and the outpour of similar stories. “He called me into a room and pulled down his pants,” she said. Then she said he asked her to perform a sexual act in front of his friends. “It was awful and disgusting,” she added. Wilson, whose latest film, Senior Year, is currently the No 1 film on Netflix, said that the unnamed actor then tried to ruin her career. “All the behavior afterwards – this was all before #MeToo – where they kind of tried to destroy me and my career,” she said. “If it had happened after #MeToo, then I could have just blasted them.” The 42-year-old initially trained as a lawyer and so she documented every detail before calling her rep to complain as well as informing those around her in the industry. “Definitely amongst industry circles, I made sure people knew what happened,” she said. Wilson often reflects on the situation and wonders what she would do if it happened now. “Why did I stay in that situation … with that awful guy?” she said. “I should have left. It wasn’t worth it. But at the same time, I was like, ‘Oh well, do the right thing, be a professional and finish the movie.’ Now I would never do that.” I thought even complaining to my agency was a big step. And to complain to the studio. I found out I was like the fourth person to complain about the guy. Such gross behavior, but a lot of women have had it way worse.” Wilson, whose credits also include How to be Single and The Hustle, will next take on her first serious role in British drama The Almond and the Seahorse alongside Celyn Jones, Meera Syal and Charlotte Gainsbourg.

5/20/2022,"For the first time in many weeks, Boris Johnson will not have to wonder this weekend if he is about to be toppled by Tory MPs angry about the Partygate scandal. Following the end of the police inquiry into multiple parties in Whitehall, some of the prime minister’s most ardent backbench critics have withdrawn their confidence letters from the 1922 Committee – which would have meant a vote on his leadership. But there are other potentially damaging challenges before this summer that could add to the impression Johnson’s days are numbered. Next week is likely to see the publication of the report by the senior civil servant Sue Gray, who oversaw an inquiry into the Partygate scandal. There are reports that the document will be highly critical of Johnson, both for attending some of the events and for the culture in No 10 under his leadership. It may help answer whether the prime minister knew the rules were being broken. The language Gray uses will be key to how damaging the revelations will be for Johnson. In yet another unwanted precedent, Johnson will face a Commons inquiry over whether he lied to parliament about Downing Street parties and whether he attended them. No prime minister has previously been referred to the committee for scrutiny. The inquiry is expected to focus on Johnson’s responses to questions in the Commons in 2021 about reports that there had been parties in No 10. He responded to many questions with assurances that the rules and guidance had been followed. The ministerial code that bears the prime minister’s signature states clearly that ministers who deliberately mislead are expected to offer their resignation. The committee will have wide-ranging powers to call for papers and other evidential documents – such as photographs, which could prove particularly damning for Johnson – and summon witnesses. But Johnson will know that there is an in-built government majority on the seven-strong committee, which may not wish to force him from office. Having survived the local elections, Johnson is braced for two more potentially damaging electoral battles in June. The Conservative party will hope to fight off a Lib Dem challenge in Tiverton and Honiton, where the party is running second; and in Wakefield, where the Tories unexpectedly won in 2019 but now face a resurgent Labour party. Both contests will carry the pervasive stench of Tory sleaze – the Devon seat was vacated by Neil Parish, who admitted to twice watching pornography in the Commons chamber. The West Yorkshire seat is free after Imran Ahmad Khan resigned in April following his conviction for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. Johnson has said the government will introduce a new law that will override the Brexit deal it signed with the EU, which set down trade rules for Northern Ireland. He is being cheered on by Brexiter commentators and the DUP, and a row with the EU does win approval from the Tory base vote. But he will have to avoid several pitfalls that could have enormous consequences for the UK. The EU has said it could launch a trade war if the UK breaks an international agreement; existing rules would allow the trading bloc to hit UK goods with tariffs within seven days of legal action or freeze the entire trade deal. Alternatively, it could suspend parts of the agreement. Any move unilaterally to break the move could spark the ire of Joe Biden’s administration which pays a close interest in the island of Ireland. The US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, a leading Democrat, said this week that Congress “cannot and will not support a bilateral free trade agreement” with the UK if it undermined the arrangement. How to confront the growing cost of living crisis while raising cash to pay for levelling up is the problem many “red wall” Tories want Johnson to tackle. Ministers are reportedly uncomfortable with a lack of policy initiatives. Multiple reports say No 10 is engaged in a battle with Rishi Sunak’s Treasury over how to respond to Labour’s call for a windfall tax on energy companies, which have enjoyed bumper profits as prices soar. Johnson is being urged by Tories to set out an alternative.",News/Politics,Beyond Partygate: five lurking threats to Boris Johnson’s leadership,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/20/beyond-partygate-five-threats-boris-johnson-leadership
5/20/2022,"HSBC is under pressure to fire a senior banker in charge of responsible investing after a speech in which he described warnings about the climate crisis as “unsubstantiated” and “shrill”, made light of major flooding risks, and complained about having to spend time “looking at something that’s going to happen in 20 or 30 years”. The bank has since been forced to denounce comments made by Stuart Kirk at a London conference on Thursday, after he gave a speech entitled “why investors need not worry about climate risk”, which appeared to discredit efforts to raise the alarm over global heating. “I feel like it’s getting a little bit out of hand, the constantl reminder that we are doomed,” Kirk told attendees at the FT’s Moral Money conference, where he also presented slides that said: “Unsubstantiated, shrill, partisan, self-serving, apocalyptic warnings are ALWAYS wrong.” “Human beings have been fantastic at adapting to change, adapting to climate emergencies, and we will continue to do so. Who cares if Miami is six metres underwater in 100 years? Amsterdam has been six metres underwater for ages and that’s a really nice place.” Kirk’s comments come despite growing concerns over record-breaking heatwaves in countries such as India, which have become much more likely due to global heating, and resulted in deaths, crop losses, and water and power shortages. Other recent analyses showed devastating floods in South Africa and Europe, heatwaves in North America and the storms in south-east Africa have been supercharged by the climate crisis. Kirk, a former editor of the Financial Times’ Lex column, also bemoaned the resource that he said HSBC was allocating to assessing climate risks. “[In] 25 years in the finance industry, there’s always some nutjob telling me about the end of the world … But what bothers me about this one, is the amount of work these people make me do, the amount of regulation coming down the pipes, the number of people in my team and at HSBC dealing with financial risks from climate change,” the banker said. Kirk, who has been HSBC’s Asset Management’s head of responsible investing for 11 months, added that those risks were “heresy”. “I work at a bank that’s being attacked by crypto. We’ve got regulators in the US trying to stop us. We’ve got the China problem. We’ve got a housing crisis looming. We’ve got interest rates going up. We’ve got inflation coming down the pipes and I’m being told to spend time … looking at something that’s going to happen in 20 or 30 years. Hence, the proportionality is completely out of whack.” Activists are urging HSBC to sack the banker. “HSBC should be asking Mr Kirk to resign: his comments are inexcusable and completely neglect the impacts of the climate crisis being felt by the global south right now,” Beau O’Sullivan, senior campaigner on the Bank on our Future campaign, said. “Sadly, he’s probably not the only bad apple within HSBC given its record of funding climate destruction.” An HSBC spokesperson refused to comment on whether Kirk had been disciplined or whether he might be at risk of losing his job as a result of the presentation, explaining that they would not comment on individual employees. The spokesperson also refused to confirm whether anyone else at the bank had seen or signed off on his speech or slides ahead of the event. HSBC Asset Management’s chief executive, Nicolas Moreau, said in a statement that Kirk’s remarks “do not reflect the views of HSBC Asset Management nor HSBC Group in any way”, and reiterated the bank’s commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050. “HSBC regards climate change as one of the most serious emergencies facing the planet, and is committed to supporting its customers in their transition to net zero and a sustainable future.” Kirk was contacted for comment.",News/Business,HSBC pressured to sack banker who discredited climate crisis warnings,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/20/hsbc-banker-discredited-climate-crisis-warnings
5/20/2022,"With monkeypox being detected in countries from the US to Australia and France to the UK, we take a look at the situation and whether it is cause for concern. Monkeypox is a viral infection typically found in central and western Africa. Cases, usually small clusters or isolated infections, are sometimes diagnosed in other countries, including the UK where the first case was recorded in 2018 in an individual thought to have contracted the virus in Nigeria. There are two forms of monkeypox, a milder west African strain and a more severe central African, or Congo strain. In Australia and the UK at least, it is thought the recently diagnosed individuals have the west African strain, although not all countries have released such information. According to the UK Health Security Agency, early symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and chills, as well as other features such as exhaustion. “A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, including the genitals,” the UKHSA says. “The rash changes and goes through different stages, and can look like chickenpox or syphilis, before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.” Most patients recover from monkeypox in a few weeks. Monkeypox does not spread easily between humans, and requires close contact. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is thought that human-to-human transmission primarily occurs through large respiratory droplets. “Respiratory droplets generally cannot travel more than a few feet, so prolonged face-to-face contact is required,” the CDC says. “Other human-to-human methods of transmission include direct contact with body fluids or lesion material, and indirect contact with lesion material, such as through contaminated clothing or linens.” Monkeypox cases have been confirmed in recent weeks in a number of countries where it is not endemic, including the US, Canada, Italy, Portugal and Sweden, with the first cases reported in Germany and Australia on Friday. Suspected cases have been identified in Spain and France. While some cases have been found in people who have recently travelled to Africa, others have not: of the two Australian cases to date, one was in a man who had recently returned from Europe, while the other was in a man who had recently been to the UK. A case in the US meanwhile appears to be in a man who recently travelled to Canada. The UK is also experiencing cases of monkeypox, with signs that it is spreading in the community. So far 20 cases have been confirmed, with the first reported on 7 May in a patient who had recently travelled to Nigeria. Not all of the cases appear to be linked and some have been diagnosed in men who self-identify as gay, bisexual, or men who have sex with men. The World Health Organization said on Tuesday that it was now coordinating with European health officials. Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, says the latest cases may be the first time transmission of monkeypox though sexual contact has been documented, but this has not been confirmed, and in any case it is probably close contact that matters. “There is no evidence that it is a sexually transmitted virus, such as HIV,” Head says. “It’s more that here the close contact during sexual or intimate activity, including prolonged skin-to-skin contact, may be the key factor during transmission.” The UKHSA is advising gay and bisexual men, as well as other communities of men who have sex with men, to look out for unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, in particular their genitalia. “Anyone with concerns that they could be infected with monkeypox is advised to make contact with clinics ahead of their visit,” the UKHSA says. At present, the answer seems to be not very. Experts have suggested it is unlikely there will be very large outbreaks, although it is important contacts of those infected are identified. Dr Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser at UKHSA, calls the situation “rare and unusual” but adds: “UKHSA is rapidly investigating the source of these infections because the evidence suggests that there may be transmission of the monkeypox virus in the community, spread by close contact.” On Friday, it emerged that the UK had bought supplies of a vaccine against smallpox – a related but more severe virus that has been eradicated. According to the World Health Organization, “vaccination against smallpox was demonstrated through several observational studies to be about 85% effective in preventing monkeypox”. The jab may help to prevent monkeypox, or reduce the severity of illness. Reports suggest the vaccine has already been offered to healthcare workers in the UK, although it is unclear how many have been vaccinated. A UKHSA spokesperson said: “Those who have required the vaccine have been offered it.” Spain has also been rumoured to be looking to buy supplies of the vaccine, while other countries – such as the US – have large stockpiles of the jabs.",News/World news,What is monkeypox and should you be worried?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/what-is-monkeypox-source-cases-infections-spread-experts
