12/24/2021,"BOSTON (AP) — A former Boston College student who prosecutors say drove her boyfriend to take his own life with thousands of text messages pleaded guilty Thursday to involuntary manslaughter. Under terms of a plea deal, Inyoung You, 23, received a 2 1/2 year suspended jail sentence and 10 years of probation and was barred by a judge in Suffolk Superior Court from profiting from her case in any way. The sentence means You can avoid time behind bars if she adheres to all the terms of her probation, which includes continued mental health treatment and community service. Prosecutors said You sent Alexander Urtula, 22, of Cedar Grove, New Jersey, tens of thousands of messages in the last two months of their relationship, including many urging him to “go kill yourself.” Urtula died in Boston in May 2019, the day of his Boston College graduation. The investigation described You and Urtula's 18-month-long relationship as “tumultuous, dysfunctional, and unhealthy,” and found You, ""engaged in deeply disturbing and at times relentless verbally, physically and psychologically abusive behavior toward Mr. Urtula,"" according to a statement from the office of Suffolk District Attorney Rachael Rollins released after Thursday's hearing. Those actions intensified in the days and hours before Urtula's death, the office said. You, who was born in South Korea and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, sent Urtula more than 47,000 text messages from late March 2019 until his death in which she “repeatedly told the victim that he should kill himself or die and waged a campaign of abuse that stripped the victim of his free will,"" the office said. “Words matter,"" Rollins said in the statement. “Demeaning language, ridicule and verbal abuse can deeply impact people."" The plea deal was reached in consultation with the Urtula family, Rollins said. The family in a statement read in court described driving to Boston for a day of celebration and instead finding themselves planning a funeral. “We bear no feelings of anger or reprisal. We believe that time will take us through in the moments we mourn and celebrate his life,” the family said. Before her arraignment in November 2019 when she originally pleaded not guilty, You, through a public relations firm, released some of the text messages suggesting she tried to stop Urtula and alerted Urtula’s brother in the moments before his death. You was given the opportunity to speak in court, but declined. Her lawyer said she was “very distraught.” Attorney Steven Kim said You is a “wonderful young woman who has deep, deep remorse.” The case was compared to that of Michelle Carter, who garnered national headlines and an HBO film. The young Massachusetts woman was sentenced to 15 months in jail after she was convicted in 2017 of involuntary manslaughter for using text messages and phone calls to encourage her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, to kill himself in 2014. Her attorney argued that her messages were protected free speech.",U.S./Associated Press,Woman who texted boyfriend to kill himself pleads guilty,https://news.yahoo.com/woman-texted-boyfriend-kill-himself-171134451.html
12/24/2021,"How great was the greatest generation? That's the question raised by a research project at Virginia Tech University, which went public on Pearl Harbor Day earlier this month. Called ""The American Soldier in World War II,"" the volunteer initiative transcribed and digitized responses to surveys administered to hundreds of thousands of military personnel between 1941 and 1940. Some of the responses are what you'd expect from a force composed largely of conscripts. Servicemen complained about the food, lack of recreational opportunities, and the military bureaucracy. Other reports are jarring by 21st century standards. The surveys found tense and sometimes embittered relations between northerners and southerners, black and whites. Contrary to pop culture depictions, many also expressed ambivalence about the goals of the war and their willingness to face combat. It's a cheap shot to blame young men for holding views that were widespread in their place and time. Emphasizing the now-retrograde attitudes toward race and sex, a Washington Post account of the project read almost as a generational cancellation. But any serious assessment requires balancing what members of U.S. forces said during World War II against what they did. The defeat of the Japanese Empire and National Socialism (in cooperation with allies appealing, repugnant, and somewhere in between) was an indisputable moral achievement. Even so, the project strikes a blow against the sanitized version of World War II promoted by media figures like news anchor Tom Brokaw, who popularized the term ""greatest generation."" In a provocative recent book, historian Elizabeth D. Samet argues that nostalgia for a glorious national effort in defense of worldwide freedom and democracy has distorted American politics for at least half a century. In pursuit of the cohesion and purpose that we think we enjoyed between 1941 and 1945, we translate every problem, foreign or domestic, into the idiom of the Second World War. That's led to mixed and sometimes disastrous results in both real and metaphorical conflicts, including this century's War on Terror. The problem isn't just that specific historical analogies don't work (not every foreign policy dispute is another Munich, not every strongman ruler is another Hitler). It's that the mythology of collective redemption through violent struggle sets expectations that can never be realized, encouraging a cycle of idealistic overreach followed by disappointed pessimism. In her introduction, Samet notes that when journalist Studs Terkel invoked ""the good war"" in the title of his own oral history, he insisted that the phrase be placed in quotation marks. The decision was not a ""matter of caprice or editorial comment, but simply because the adjective 'good' mated to the noun 'war' is so incongruous."" Ironically, the people who experienced the war were our best reminders of this incongruity. When telling their own stories, whether in private or in print, they displayed little of the certainty or triumphalism now associated with their experiences. The explicitly war-themed works of Norman Mailer or Paul Fussell, to say nothing of more oblique treatments in midcentury film noir, are hardly advertisements for the restorative properties of war. Rather than a form of self-congratulation, the cult of the greatest generation was the product of Americans born during or shortly before the war who grew up in awe of fathers, older brothers, or relatives who'd worn uniforms. Many of this cohort did serve — in Korea, Vietnam, or elsewhere. But few found the moral or political satisfaction they'd expected. Partly inspired by genuine historical interest, immersion in the ""good war"" of the past could also be a compensation for uncertainty and upheaval younger Americans wrongly believed was specific to the second half of the 20th century. That's why the 1990s saw an explosion of World War II-themed popular culture, much of it produced by and for men in late middle age. At the time, the greatest generation could still speak for themselves, sometimes offering a sharp rebuke to excessively romanticized depictions. That's more difficult today, with only about 240,000 veterans still alive, and many of those failing in mental and physical health. The Virginia Tech project is essential neither because it documents people who were much better than us, nor because it provides a window onto a benighted past. Instead, it records the voices of ordinary men, whose experiences warn us against the confusion, corruption, injustice, and horror that attend even the most necessary of wars.
