12/24/2021,"Lawyers working on behalf of Nirvana have filed to dismiss a lawsuit made against the band by Spencer Elden, who appeared as a baby on the cover of their album Nevermind. In the lawsuit filed in August, Elden claimed he was the victim of child sexual exploitation and that the cover artwork was a child sexual abuse image. “Defendants knowingly produced, possessed and advertised commercial child pornography depicting Spencer,” the lawsuit read.  Elden amended it in November, adding details including a passage from Kurt Cobain’s journals that describes imagined child sexual abuse. He also removed a number of named defendants. Lawyers for the remaining defendants – Nirvana members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic; Courtney Love, executor of Cobain’s estate; and Kirk Weddle, the photographer of the cover image – have now sought to dismiss Elden’s suit. They claim that the two statutes under which Elden is filing his complaint have time limitations that will invalidate it and that the lawsuit “falls on its face” by being filed too late. Elden’s claim that the image is of child sexual abuse is described by the lawyers as “not serious. A brief examination of the photograph, or Elden’s own conduct (not to mention the photograph’s presence in the homes of millions of Americans who, on Elden’s theory, are guilty of felony possession of child pornography) makes that clear.” The motion claims the image instead “evokes themes of greed, innocence, and the motif of the cherub in western art”. In his lawsuit, Elden said that appearing on the cover of Nevermind caused him “extreme and permanent emotional distress with physical manifestations”, plus loss of education, wages, and “enjoyment of life”. Lawyers for Nirvana have countered that Elden “has spent three decades profiting from his celebrity as the self-anointed ‘Nirvana Baby’”, including recreating the image for the album’s 15th and 25th anniversaries. They make reference to the fact Elden has a tattoo of the word Nevermind on his chest, which Grohl also addressed when asked about the lawsuit in October: “He’s got a Nevermind tattoo. I feel the same way most people do in that I have to disagree [with Elden’s allegations]”. Nirvana’s lawyers have called for a hearing for their dismissal motion in January.",Arts/Music,Nirvana seek to dismiss sexual abuse lawsuit concerning Nevermind cover,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/24/nirvana-lawsuit-nevermind
12/24/2021,"The Queen’s Christmas Day message is expected to be a particularly personal one this year, her first since the death of the Duke of Edinburgh. A photograph released by Buckingham Palace ahead of her televised address shows the Queen sitting behind a desk in the White Drawing Room at Windsor Castle, accompanied by a single, framed picture of the couple taken in 2007 at Broadlands country house, Hampshire, to mark their diamond wedding anniversary.  The handout from the palace shows the Queen wearing an embossed wool shift dress in Christmas red, by the British designer Angela Kelly, as well as a sapphire chrysanthemum brooch the then Princess Elizabeth wore for a photocall on her honeymoon, also to Broadlands, in 1947, and for the couple’s diamond wedding celebrations. This year’s message follows the death of the duke in April aged 99. Coronavirus restrictions at the time meant the Queen was memorably and poignantly forced to sit alone in St George’s Chapel for his funeral service. Clarence House has confirmed the Queen will spend Christmas Day with the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. The monarch had said she would remain in Windsor for Christmas amid the rapid spread of the Omicron Covid variant. The Queen normally hosts her large family at Sandringham in Norfolk, where they are usually watched by crowds as they attend church on 25 December, although Covid meant this did not happen last year. The Queen also cancelled a traditional pre-Christmas lunch with her extended family, which had been scheduled for Tuesday. Buckingham Palace announced on Thursday a service of thanksgiving for the life of the Duke of Edinburgh would take place in spring 2022 at Westminster Abbey. Her speech will mark the closing of an eventful year for the royals, which included Harry and Meghan’s bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey in which they accused an unnamed royal of racism, as well as making other allegations about the institution. The royals also had to contend with allegations from Virginia Giuffre, who started legal action against the Duke of York for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager. Andrew has repeatedly denied all claims. The Queen’s address will be broadcast across multiple channels at 3pm on Christmas Day.",News/UK news,Queen expected to strike personal tone in Christmas Day message,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/24/queen-expected-strike-personal-tone-christmas-day-message-2021
12/24/2021,"Even as economists celebrated a job market recovery seen from the beginning of the pandemic, when unemployment peaked at 14.8%, to November when unemployment was 4.2%, Black Americans have continued to see a much higher jobless rate.  In November, Black Americans had an unemployment rate of 6.7%, while the unemployment rate for white Americans was 3.5%. The gap is even more pronounced between men: Black men had an unemployment rate of 7.3% in November while white men saw an unemployment rate of 3.4%. That this disparity has continued over the course of the pandemic is unsurprising to economists who have long paid attention to the racial gap in unemployment numbers. Valerie Wilson, director of the Economic Policy Institute’s Program on Race, Ethnicity and the Economy, said that occupational segregation has meant that Black Americans were less likely to be able to work remotely amid lockdown orders. Many Black workers were given the choice of keeping jobs where they faced greater risks or deciding that the risk was not worth it. “The two-to-one [disparity] has still been pretty consistent, and I think that says a lot to just how deeply entrenched those labor market inequalities are,” Willson said. Black Americans have long faced discrimination in hiring processes. One study from 2017 showed that Black Americans who remove references to their race on their resumes are twice more likely to get interviews. The unemployment rate is even consistent across educational levels, with the unemployment rates of Black Americans who have a high school or bachelor’s degree being twice that of White Americans who hold the same degree. Though many companies promised to reevaluate their hiring processes and focus on diverse recruitment following the massive protests after the murder of George Floyd in summer 2020, the racial gap in the unemployment rate still managed to stick. Other figures show that little progress has been made: There are just five Black CEOs leading Fortune 500 companies, and Black full-time workers are still making more than 20% less than white full-time workers. Even the gains that Black Americans have seen in employment numbers come with caveats. In November, the unemployment rate for Black women jumped 2%, from 7% to 5% – the largest decrease for any group. While the number reflects Black women starting jobs, it also reflects tens of thousands of women who left the workforce last month, more than 90,000, according to government figures. Even while moms across the board have faced problems with childcare during the pandemic, research has shown that Black mothers in particular have faced the toughest childcare issues during the pandemic. Wilson said there are multiple policies that need to be in place to address the unemployment rate gap but noted the complacency policymakers seem to have with the two-to-one disparity between the Black and White unemployment rates. “Part of the challenge and difficulty in addressing it is that it sort of becomes normalized, like ‘Oh, OK – that’s just how it works’, without us actually sort of questioning and interrogating the way that we understand those disparities,” Wilson said.",News/Business,Black Americans continue to see higher jobless rate despite market recovery,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/24/black-americans-jobless-rate-job-market
12/24/2021,"Stephen Karam has adapted his award-winning 2016 Broadway play for the cinema, and directs: the result is like an expressionist horror by Polanski. In theory, it’s about a family gathering for a Thanksgiving lunch, the sort of event that can usually be expected to bring about the phased disclosure of all the characters’ individual secrets and micro-tragedies. This feels more serious. These people look like the last group of humans left alive after some apocalyptic catastrophe, the remnants of homo sapiens being watched and examined at a distance by aliens. The grimly damp and undecorated duplex in which they have assembled could almost be a mass hallucination, triggered by a trauma worse than anything they’re talking about. Brigid (Beanie Feldstein) and Richard (Steven Yeun) are a young couple who have put themselves under great financial strain to rent a place in Manhattan: this dark, dank, creepy apartment. Perhaps to brazen out whatever second thoughts they’re having, the couple have invited their extended family for a Thanksgiving lunch as a housewarming event, before they’ve had a chance to get it properly furnished. Brigid’s parents Deirdre (Jayne Houdyshell) and Erik (Richard Jenkins) arrive with Erik’s mother Momo (June Squibb) in a wheelchair: she has dementia. Then there is Brigid’s sister Aimee (Amy Schumer) who is on her own after a breakup.  The pure, oppressive strangeness of the apartment makes it a seventh character: the spectre at the feast. Characters are always wandering off on their own into the gloom to have tense conversations in twos and threes, or jump at the unexplained thumps and bangs in the walls. It’s an ominous place, like Macbeth’s castle before the murder, and the collective unhappiness is dimming the lights. Erik has a drink problem and accepts more beers from Richard than he really ought, and the booze loosens his tongue on the subject of how hurt he is that the children have abandoned their Christian faith and also their hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania in favour of pricey New York. Deirdre is judging and critical. Brigid is a would-be composer who keeps failing to get grants and resents her dad for not helping out financially. She may yet have to take a humiliating job in a department store – an awful fate that is to echo the revelation that Erik is later to spring on everyone. Richard is recovering from depression and Aimee’s legal career is stagnant; she has health issues and is faced with living and dying alone. As for Momo, she murmurs and sometimes moans nonsense words, but is heart-rendingly mute while Deirdre reads aloud the emotional, loving email she wrote to her granddaughters while she was still lucid. Karam and his cinematographer Lol Crawley will often record their conversations at a distance, as if they have these people under surveillance. Often, the camera will home in on the damp patches bubbling and cracking the walls, or the clanking old pipes along which weird echoey sounds travel. Sometimes a conversation will take place behind a fiercely detailed closeup of a pigeon feather on a window sill, which has been torn off by one of the anti-vermin spikes. The impending sense of doom and the uncanny takes The Humans beyond miserablism. Are these people sleepwalkers? Or is this all a dream or memory that one of them is having? Very real issues are suffused with an oppressive, unearthly, compelling unreality.  The Humans is released on 24 December on Curzon Home Cinema and on 26 December in cinemas.",Arts/Film,The Humans review – Thanksgiving family drama turns apocalyptic,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/24/the-humans-review-festive-family-drama-turns-apocalyptic
12/24/2021,"The beauty treatments listed at the new La Beauté & Style salon are much the same as those offered by the dozen or so other parlours that dot the traffic-heavy Dilshad Extension area of Ghaziabad, 17 miles (28km) east of Delhi. But that is where the similarity ends. The wall behind the reception desk is painted in rainbow colours; a mural of a trans man with flowing multicoloured locks decorates another wall; a woman wearing a sari is having her eyebrows plucked next to a trans man who is telling a stylist how he would like his hair cut.  La Beauté & Style salon created history in September when it opened as India’s first salon run by transgender men. The owner, Aryan Pasha, 30, is a lawyer, activist and India’s first transgender male bodybuilder. He opened the salon to create a space where trans people would feel comfortable requesting beauty treatments. Everyone is welcome, he says, not just the LGBTQ+ community. Of equal importance was creating a business that would generate employment for his community, which “continues to face social discrimination and rejection in academic institutes, as well as at workplaces, despite the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act 2019,”, he says. “While conducting food and ration-distribution drives during the epidemic, it was heartbreaking to encounter young transgenders who were educated and skilled but jobless due to their gender. They were surviving on charity donations, while others were forced to return to unsupportive and abusive families in their villages,” says Pasha. With financial help from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/Aids and the Gravittus Foundation, a Pune-based charity that works for social change, Pasha set up the salon with his partner, Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, 43. . Tripathi has been a transgender activist since 1999, campaigning for numerous causes from HIV to community-led social enterprises. Through their charity, the Gaurav Trust, the couple focuses on raising awareness and protecting the health and rights of male sex workers and others within the LGBTQ+ community. “Despite our collective advocacy and action over the years to mainstream issues like the welfare, rights and health of transgender people, stigma remains a major challenge. We face a hostile environment within schools, colleges and at the workplace, which leaves us scarred for life,” says Pasha, who transitioned from female to male after gender-reassignment surgery in 2011. According to a 2017 study by India’s National Human Rights Commission, 92% of transgender people in India are deprived of the right to participate in any form of economic activity in the country; 99% have suffered social rejection on more than one occasion, including from their family; and 96% are denied jobs and forced into areas such as sex work or begging to survive. At Le Beauté, the six newly trained staff earn £100 to £300 a month, depending upon their level of expertise and skill. More beauticians are being trained near Mumbai. “We plan to open our next salon in Pune and ultimately go national once we get more funding,” says Pasha. Bhanu Rajodiya, 25, says he was at the lowest point in his life when Pasha recruited him. “I used to work at an export house in Delhi and earn £80 to £100 a month, but I lost my job during the pandemic. My family turned its back on me, but the salon embraced me and I now have a secure job with a fixed income. It’s so empowering.” Another employee, Nakshatra Rajput, who transitioned last year, worked in Delhi as a team leader but lost his job when the management discovered his identity. “They started finding faults in my work and the work atmosphere became so toxic, I had no choice but to leave. This was despite the fact that I was transparent about my gender to the HR department when I joined. They hired me for my skills and paid me well, but kicked me out at whim,” says the 25-year-old. Rajput added that though his parents and friends had accepted him, Indian workplaces were far from inclusive. “This discrimination really hurts. After leaving my first company, I joined another one but had to leave that also within days because of my identity,” he says. However, he is happy that La Beauté opened a door for him and trained him as a hairstylist – and has recently made him a part of the salon’s management team. “I feel loved and appreciated here,” he says. “I no longer have to act or hide behind a different identity just to do my job. It’s so liberating. And that’s how society should be too – inclusive and diverse,” he says pointing proudly to the salon’s rainbow-hued walls.

12/24/2021,"As of Wednesday this week, a quarter of all kids at state school in New York were absent, for virus or other reasons. In the UK, a week before Christmas, they wouldn’t have been at school in the first place, but across much of the US, winter break doesn’t start until Christmas Eve. Every year this seems ungenerous, but this year it’s unbearable. We struggle in on Wednesday in -3C weather, and that night I have a conniption. That’s it, we’re out. I tell my kids, we’ll stay home tomorrow; the vacation starts now. It costs me something to say this. Through a combination of kneejerk rule-following and a desire to have the house to myself, we rarely skip school, even when people are sick (not with Covid). Until recently, we didn’t skip anything much. I’ve long subscribed to the theory that it’s better to do things than not do things. I also have to be vigilante against constant lobbying from my kids to take the line of least resistance. “No, we’re going, so stop asking me,” is a phrase played on repeat in my house with varying levels of crossness. “Giving up” is bad. Effortful endeavour is good. “You’ll enjoy it once you get there” – a line used every Thursday night by my mother when I didn’t want to go to Brownies – has surfaced three decades later to be rolled out prior to violin, taekwondo and playdates in the park. Silently, I say it to myself as I shrug on my jacket prior to dinners.  The thing is, I hated Brownies and never did enjoy it when I got there, but it’s too late to rewire now. The desire to opt out, an expression of lassitude in other years, is in any case different this year. “Do you think it’s dementia?” a friend texted this week. Her kid is in one of my kid’s classes and she too pulled them out early, only in her case she got the dates wrong. The ability to plan and retain information has been messed up by the stress of Covid and we’re also physically depleted. “Do you think I should get an MRI?” texted my friend, which made me laugh. She’s a nurse practitioner; I’m a writer. In the immortal words of James Corden to Adele when she asked him what to do with her hair during Carpool Karaoke: “What I like is that you’re coming to me for this advice.” But in these dog days of the pandemic, the anxiety is common: am I tired-tired, or diagnosis-tired? If I’m tired-tired, I have to push through it. That is what we’ve been taught, and in the face of even the mildest desire to do otherwise all the old superstitions rise up. Conditioning kicks in. What will happen if we don’t do the thing? Pre-Covid, this anxiety was characterised as Fomo (fear of missing out), but it was always more than that. Going out is active and leads to wellbeing and wisdom. Staying in – sitting, watching, reading, thinking – is passive and constitutes giving up. The first is morally superior, while the latter is a gateway to nowhere. The fear, always, has been that given too much downtime some kind of lotus-eater scenario will kick in – doing the thing is great, but have you tried not doing the thing? Oh, man. It’s amazing – and after a few evenings on the sofa we will sink into it forever like quicksand. I still broadly agree with this characterisation. Mostly, when we force ourselves out, the experience is better than Brownies. Action begets action. Serendipity is hard to pull off in front of the telly at home. And scrolling has introduced a whole new level of irresistible emptiness to what we erroneously call relaxation. But it also strikes me that giving up needs rebranding. There is, sometimes, something to be said for sitting motionless and staring into space. A decisive opt-out needn’t be wholly passive. We are doing this thing at the expense of the other thing and it’s an active choice, not simply inertia. The night before we skip school, I am pathetically stressed. I read, with relief, that more than 420 of the city’s roughly 65,000 classrooms won’t be open on Thursday because of Covid, so it’s not likely anyone’s going to care. It’s responsible, in a way, to take two vectors of infection out of the classroom two days before the holiday. So much mental effort for a tiny break. That’s it, I’m done. Happy Christmas.

The 100 best male footballers in the world 2021 How they made their choices Our judges were sent a longlist of more than 300 players drawn from leagues on every continent and asked one simple question: who have been the best male players in the world in 2021? We asked our judges to choose 40 names each and rank their selection in order from 1-40, No 1 being their choice of the best player. How the voting works The No 1 choice of each judge was awarded 40 points, No 2 given 39, down to one point for their No 40. All the votes were added together to give a raw score. To minimise the influence of outliers in the list, the highest score awarded to a player was then deducted to give a final score. A player needed to receive votes from at least five judges to qualify for the list. If players are level on points in the scoring, the number of individual votes cast is used as a tie-breaker.",Sport/Football,The 100 best male footballers 2021: see how every judge voted,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/24/the-100-best-male-footballers-2021-see-how-every-judge-voted
12/24/2021,"What a festive joy it has been to read about the books you remember getting for Christmas – and also to see how many of you, like me, adored Kaye Webb’s I Like This Poem. Whether it was the Rupert annuals received yearly by LancsLionheart, or the boxed set of Roald Dahl’s children’s books which auspom started on Christmas Day and worked through over the rest of the holidays, it just goes to show that there’s nothing better to find under the tree than a book. For LawrenceWindrush, a 14-year-old in 1980, it was his sister who gave him Arthur C Clarke’s Mysterious World. “During the Christmas week I was lost in the world of crystal skulls, the Yeti and UFOs. The world seemed magical and exciting – anything was possible among all the wrapping paper, turkey sandwiches and nuts. Exciting times.”  benwood201 was given an abridged version of Moby-Dick “which had wonderfully vivid illustrations. Queequeg, with his tattooed face, the whale tossing a boat high in the air with its fluke and Ahab being dragged down by the whale entangled in his harpoon line.” KateSheehanFinn says her life was changed by Gobbolino, The Witch’s Cat by Ursula Moray Williams. “It was in my Christmas stocking when I was eight years old. I read it with my mum first, then on my own, over and over again. It taught me what a gripping story was and how immersive reading a good book can be.” TheBorderGuard is “still profoundly affected by the late 1950s Lord of the Rings edition I received as a teenager from my cousin”, and staying on the science fiction and fantasy theme, Rhialto remembers getting boxed sets of paperbacks in the 1980s. “Stephen R Donaldson’s Thomas Covenant series. Brian Aldiss’s Helliconia trilogy. Piers Anthony’s Xanth series. And the one that brings back the most vivid memories – Herbert’s Dune trilogy (back when it was a trilogy). Just looking at the covers of the late 70s edition Dune books today sends a jolt of nostalgia through me.” dylan37 has a lovely story to tell, which I think contains a bit of Christmas magic. “I was given a book for my 11th Christmas called The War on William Street by Reginald Ottley. It was an amazing tale of a street gang of boys in 50s Sydney, a time and place so foreign to me, but utterly compelling. I never forgot it. I don’t know what happened to those books as I grew up and moved into adult life, but I always kept a strong memory of those Sydney boys, like the imagery in a lost Triffids song perhaps,” they write. “Thirty years later, at great expense, I tracked down a copy of the long deleted book. When it arrived, from the other side of the world, I opened it, and had the best and deepest Proustian rush I’ve ever experienced. Important books will do that to you, no matter how long you leave between reads. And I can’t be entirely sure, but I have the strongest and strangest feeling that it’s the exact same book I had as a child. There’s no markings or inscription, no missing or torn pages that remind me, but I’m connected to this book somehow beyond words and memory.” I also love this, from PatLux: “When we were 11 and 12 my parents gave my sister and me a Christmas gift of a subscription to the village tennis courts, a tennis racket each and balls. Also a small green tennis book of the teach yourself type. I remember devouring the book and practising the moves in our bedroom. Over 50 years later I am still playing tennis twice a week and have treated myself to some lessons starting this evening. I often tell my mother that it was the best Christmas present ever.” And I’m definitely in agreement with Clareontarget on this one: I love Jean M Auel too (although the Clan of the Cave Bear series definitely goes downhill after Plains of Passage). “When I was much younger and still living with my mother I would be given something every Christmas by an elderly neighbour of ours. Generally it would be something completely pointless or inappropriate. However one Christmas she bought me a book (hallelujah!) and it was the right kind of book. It was the third book in the Earth’s Children series by Jean M Auel and it was promptly devoured, repeatedly. It goes without saying that I am in possession of all six books of the series and they have all been worthwhile reads.” Patching always got a book for Christmas from their parents, and remembers a particular gift at age seven: Nature’s Playground by M Cordelia and E Leigh. “Dense text, glossy paper, terribly old-fashioned even then, It had chapters on all manner of wildlife with titles like ‘A populous Queendom’ (Bees) and ‘Sun Lovers and Strange Monsters’ (Reptiles) and ‘illustrated with over 250 photographs and diagrams’. It was way, way too advanced for me, but I was fascinated and pored over diagrams of sepals and nectaries, thorax and abdomen, and fell in love with the natural world and the strange, courtly language used to write about it. ‘The nest of the long-tailed tit is most cunningly built’; ‘the extremely ugly, dull-black beetle called the Devil’s Coach Horse … but though so ugly and fierce and disagreeable, he cannot really do us any harm …’ Funny old book, but it helped to set me off on a life of fascination with the myriad, gorgeous weirdness of the natural world and attempt to write about it myself.” After David Barnett revealed his night terrors on receiving a copy of Usborne’s The World of the Unknown: Ghosts, many others also shared beloved stories of the uncanny. “I was given a children’s book of scary stories for Christmas when I was about 10,” writes Angelaaaa. “A lovely hardcover, bound with leatherette and gold writing on the spine. It included, among other horrors, The Monkey’s Paw and Sweets to the Sweet. I was utterly terrified and fearfully read and reread it for years.” I know many of us have been stymied in our present-giving by the lack of new Discworld novels since the much-mourned Terry Pratchett’s death, so it was glorious to read Sam Jordison’s memories of receiving The Colour of Magic. And I have definitely been inspired to add a few extra books to my pile of presents this year as a result of all your wonderful memories. I’m not sure anything will beat my most triumphant present ever, though – when I tracked down old editions of Douglas Hill’s then out-of-print Blade of the Poisoner and Master of Fiends for my similarly fantasy-obsessed husband.
