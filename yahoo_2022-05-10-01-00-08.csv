5/10/2022,"When going through TSA, taking large electronics out and packing liquids less than 3.4 fl. oz. is the norm. However, that norm may soon be a thing of the past, thanks to the future of airport technology. Ireland’s Shannon Airport implemented its new CT scanning security system in October 2021. This new technology allows liquids to have no restrictions on volume. Shannon Airport is not new to being a pioneer in the travel industry. In 1947, the airport opened the world’s first Duty-Free shop. In 2009, Shannon Airport became the first airport in the world to provide full US pre-clearance facilities. Donegal Airport, also located in Ireland, has installed the new technology, which costs around $2.6 million. The CT scans are similar to the ones used in hospitals. Airports will replace 2D scans with 3D imaging. Kevin Riordan, head of checkpoint solutions at Smiths Detection tells CNN Travel, “From a security point of view, they’re able to make very accurate decisions about what the materials are in your bag: Is it a likely threat material or is it benign. That’s better security, better decisions.” New technology means less time for travelers in airport security lines. The liquid ban came into play in August 2006, when a terrorist plot to detonate liquid explosives on multiple air crafts was stopped. Before the liquid ban, airport security lines moved more quickly.

5/10/2022,"Mark Esper says he repeatedly tried to warn Trump against withholding aid to Ukraine. Trump's defense secretary writes in a new book that Trump questioned why the US needed to help Ukraine. Trump withheld nearly $400 million in military assistance to Ukraine. Former Defense secretary Mark Esper claims that he warned President Donald Trump that withholding military aid to Ukraine was both illegal and that it would further weaken Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government. ""I ran through a series of arguments that failed time and time again: deterrence of Russian aggression; showing Moscow our commitment to our partners; and aiding a democracy under siege,"" Esper writes in Politico Magazine in an adapted excerpt from his forthcoming book ""A Sacred Oath: Memoirs of a Secretary of Defense During Extraordinary Times."" ""I then pivoted to the fact that 'Congress appropriated the funding, and we don't really have a choice' to not release it. 'It is the law, Mr. President,' I said bluntly."" Esper writes that Trump was unmoved by the suggestion that he was breaking the law. ""With his arms folded in front of him as he leaned forward into his desk, he was silent. He didn't seem to care."" Esper's caveats only add to the long list of officials who cautioned Trump about withholding aid to Ukraine. But Trump didn't listen and his administration froze nearly $400 million in congressionally-approved military assistance for over two months. Experts echoed Esper's point at the time, arguing that Trump's defiance of Congress potentially violated two budgetary laws that lawmakers enacted decades ago to thwart presidents trying to ignore them. House lawmakers later impeached Trump later over the episode but he was acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate. Trump's pressuring of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his family over baseless allegations of corruption has received renewed attention since Russia began its war in Ukraine on February 22. Trump in recent months has boasted about providing Javelin anti-tank missiles to Kyiv during his presidency, while omitting the fact that he withheld vital military aid from Ukraine as Ukrainian forces fought a war against Kremlin-backed rebels in the eastern Donbas region. The full-scale war in Ukraine that Putin launched in late February was an expansion of the conflict in the country's east that began back in 2014 after Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea. Former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, whose ouster was one of the focuses of the impeachment proceedings, previously told Insider that during the Trump era Russian President Vladimir Putin ""could just sit back and let the good times roll."" Similarly, Fiona Hill, who served as the top Russia expert on the National Security Council under the Trump administration, in February told CNN that Trump opened the door for Putin to invade Ukraine by treating the country like a ""playground."" In response to some of Esper's claims, Trump released a statement to ""60 Minutes"" calling his former Pentagon chief ""Yesper"" and saying Esper was so ""weak and totally ineffective"" that Trump had to run the military himself. Esper's book goes on sale tomorrow.

5/10/2022,"Earlier in the pandemic, contact tracing data showed us where COVID-19 was predominantly spreading. Unfortunately, because our contact tracing efforts have slowed down, we don’t have as clear of a picture regarding where people are mostly likely to contract omicron and its subvariants. What we do know is that, while the virus has evolved to be much more transmissible than previous variants, the way COVID-19 spreads hasn’t changed. “Nothing has changed in terms of how any individual right now, regardless of their day-to-day activity, can pick this virus up,” Mark Cameron, infectious disease researcher at Case Western Reserve University, told HuffPost. Because of that, we can assume there are some hot spots for BA.2 and other omicron subvariants compared to others. Here are common places where COVID-19 still spreads, according to experts: By now, we’ve all heard it a million times. COVID-19 spreads in crowded, indoor settings — think: gyms, restaurants, concerts, bars and the like. Cameron said there’s no shortage of anecdotes about how the virus is spreading at such events. Massive outbreaks have recently been recorded after Phish’s four-night concert run, the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, and the annual Washington Gridiron Club dinner, as well as on cruises and after high school proms. In crowded, poorly ventilated indoor settings, aerosols containing the virus can spread in the air and easily be inhaled by many. “Similar to other COVID variants, BA.2 spreads more easily in crowded, indoor locations with limited ventilation,” said Bernadette Boden-Albala, director and founding dean of the Program in Public Health at the University of California, Irvine. COVID-19 is also known to spread easily between family members — and roommates — who live together. Research published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in February shows that COVID-19 now has a household transmission rate of about 53%. Transmission is even more likely to occur when members of the same household are unvaccinated along with those who don’t wear a mask or isolate. “The ability to transmit from one person to another in close quarters, that will still happen. Nothing has changed in terms of how we can catch this very infectious airborne virus when we are in close proximity to someone else,” Cameron said. Boden-Albala said household spread is especially prominent in apartment living and multi-family homes, which reaffirms that COVID-19 ― and all its strains ― can be a disease of disparities. Even though the variants have changed, how COVID spreads largely remains the same. (Photo: AzmanL via Getty Images) Since the start of the pandemic, COVID-19 has been shown to rip through senior care facilities. While recent data from the CDC shows that boosters significantly help nursing home residents avoid severe outcomes, nursing homes and other congregate living facilities are still prone to major outbreaks.  Seventeen long-term care homes in Winnipeg, Canada, reported outbreaks last week. A women’s prison in Vermont experienced an outbreak in late April, as have a handful of long-term care facilities in the state. “Those are, since the start and still are, thehotbeds of outbreaks,” Cameron said.  Andrew Noymer, an epidemiologist and demographer who studies infectious diseases at University of California, Irvine, said the main takeaway is that COVID-19 spreads indoors. “Anywhere you’re indoors, that’s where it’s spreading — anywhere and everywhere,” Noymer said. Boden-Albala noted that BA.2 is spreading in places that are the usual suspects: “settings like bars and restaurants where attendees may share food and beverages or wear their masks intermittently — if at all.”  Whether you have dinner at a friend’s house, go over to a relative’s for game night, take a taxi, go into an office or go out to eat, if you are indoors, there is a risk you could catch COVID-19. While planes are typically less risky due to their powerful air filtration systems, people can still catch COVID-19 while flying if they are seated near someone who is infected. Despite the fact that masking is no longer required on planes, Noymer continues to recommend wearing an N95 mask on a plane.  The risk of being exposed to COVID-19 may be less now than it was in January, when the country experienced a massive surge, but it is still notable since the latest variants are that much more contagious.  “These new omicron variants are fit and they’re easily transmittable,” Cameron said.  Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus.

5/10/2022,"(Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday ordered the creation of a working group on international payments whose tasks will include figuring out terms for transactions with ""unfriendly"" states. Putin said in March that Russia, the world's largest natural gas producer, would require countries it deems hostile to pay for fuel in roubles by opening accounts at Gazprombank and making payments in euros or dollars, to be converted into Russian currency. Poland and Bulgaria refused to comply, and Russian energy giant Gazprom cut them off last month. The Kremlin has said the same will happen to anyone else who rejects the new payment terms. The working group will come up with ""an infrastructure for international payments, including in Russian roubles, with trading partners from foreign states and territories that carry out unfriendly actions against Russia,"" the order said. It will also look into payment terms in roubles and other national currencies with friendly countries - which would include China and India, although they were not named. The group -- which will be led by presidential adviser Maxim Oreshkin and include top officials such as Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina -- is also tasked with finding measures to reduce the risks associated with the freezing of nearly half of Russia's $640 billion of foreign reserves. Western countries have imposed sweeping sanctions against Russia for sending its troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24. Moscow says it is carrying out a ""special military operation"" aimed at disarming Ukraine and ridding it of what it says are dangerous nationalists. Russia is imposing counter-sanctions and has approved a list of ""unfriendly"" countries including the United States, Canada, Britain and European Union member states.

5/10/2022,"UK defence secretary has mocked ""manicured"" Russian generals taking part in Moscow's Victory Day parade. Ben Wallace blasted the hypocrisy of marking the end of WW2 while fighting in a ""war of choice"" in Ukraine. Putin used his Victory Day speech to repeat false claims about Kyiv being run by neo-Nazis. The UK's defence secretary has taken aim at Russia's generals marking Victory Day in ""their manicured parade uniforms,"" accusing them of hypocrisy in light of Vladimir Putin's ""unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine."" In a major speech Monday, Ben Wallace accused the Kremlin of insulting the memory of fallen Soviet forces in the annual parade that marks the defeat of Adolf Hitler's army during the Second World War. Speaking at the National Army Museum, Wallace said the West should ""call out the absurdity"" of the celebrations, accusing Russian soldiers of ""being utterly complicit in Putin's hijacking of their forebears' proud history of defending against a ruthless invasion."" ""Instead now, they are the ones inflicting needless suffering in the service of lowly gangsterism. They are the ones who truly insult the memory of the Immortal Regiment,"" he added. Putin launched a ""war of choice"" against Ukraine, Wallace said, arguing that in doing so ""he and his generals are now ripping up both Russia's past and its future."" All professional soldiers ""should be appalled at the behaviour of the Russian Army,"" the Cabinet minister added. ""Not only are they engaged in an illegal invasion and war crimes but their top brass have failed their own rank and file to the extent they should be court martialled."" The speech was given on the same day Moscow throws a lavish military parade in a show of strength against Ukraine and NATO, including a display of the so-called ""doomsday plane,"" a flying command center Putin would likely use in the event of a nuclear attack on Russia. The annual parade through Red Square, which marks the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany on May 9, 1945, is a showpiece of Russian military power. Speaking in the Red Square Monday, Putin repeated his false claim that the democratically elected government in Kyiv was run by neo-Nazis and that NATO posed a threat to Russian sovereignty. During an 11-minute address, the Russian president told troops: ""Today you are fighting for our people in Donbas, for the security of Russia, our motherland."" Putin claimed NATO and Ukrainian troops were ""preparing a punishing operation in Donbas to intrude on our historic lands,"" the BBC reported. ""In Kyiv they were saying they might get nuclear weapons and NATO started exploring the lands close to us, and that became an obvious threat to us and our borders."" Russian news agencies said 11,000 troops and 131 armoured vehicles took part in the event, including Russia's Armata tanks, which have not been considered combat-ready for the war in Ukraine.
