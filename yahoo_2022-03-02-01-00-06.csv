3/2/2022,"Bebe Rexha is living her best life in Hawaii and she's got the Instagram photo dump to prove it. In a slew of new snaps, the 32-year-old ""I'm a Mess"" singer is rocking a floral-print string bikini—and I can't get my eyes off her ultra-toned abs. They're absolutely sculpted! Bebe, who works out with trainer Jeanette Jenkins, loves to box. She also stays in shape by going on regular runs and doing Pilates. We're pretty sure Bebe Rexha had the best Valentine's Day any gal could have. The 32-year-old singer spent the day posted up at the beach in O'ahu, Hawaii, getting in some amazing sun and celebrating her body in a floral bikini—paired with a matching sarong and chunky gold chains that included a red heart charm. (She was there to announce that she will be a guest mentor on the new season of American Idol for its 20th season.) ""Happy Valentine’s Day from Hawai’i love you 💋💋💋,"" she captioned the photo dump. Paris Hilton left her a ""😍."" And the post was practically spammed with ""🔥🔥🔥"" galore. When she's not lounging on the beach, Bebe loves to work hard in the gym with her personal trainer Jeanette Jenkins. Bebe explained to Health that she and Jeanette love to switch things up. “One day we’ll do yoga; one day we’ll do Pilates,” she said. “We can run one day or box, which is my favorite. When I go to different places, I’ll try to run or go to the gym—or I’ll take cycling classes or boxing classes wherever I am.” And of course, she likes to get active outdoors by going on bike rides. She also shared with Us that, ""I love boxing and have started training a lot during the pandemic."" As for her diet, Bebe likes to eat healthy because it makes her feel her best. ""When I have a bad week of eating, I feel so nasty—like when I eat tons of chips or croissants and whatever,"" she told People. ""When I eat healthier and I drink more water and then I do even a little exercising or just try to live a little bit more actively, I feel so much better: I feel so much healthier, I feel so much sexier, and it's for myself. So I feel like that's a really important thing for me, to stay active and eat well."" She also loves cooking: ""I absolutely love hosting dinner parties for my friends,"" she told Us. ""I enjoy cooking Italian dishes. Penne alla vodka is my [specialty]!"" And she also added, ""I love baking banana bread."" We want to try it, Bebe!!

3/2/2022,"The two reportedly complained to flight attendants for over an hour before the Black woman was asked to move to the back row. A California woman claims she had a Rosa Parks experience on a recent Delta Airlines flight when she was asked to give up her seat and move to the back of the plane in order to accommodate two white women. As reported by Revolt, Camille Henderson was on her way back to the Bay Area from Atlanta on Feb. 3 when Delta flight attendants asked her to give her her seat after the two white women sitting next to her in the same row complained about not having enough room. “They felt like they were ticketed first-class seats, but they couldn’t provide the tickets,” Henderson told ABC7 News. The two women reportedly complained to flight attendants for over an hour before Henderson was asked by airline staff to move to row 34, the plane’s last row. Henderson shared an audio recording with ABC7 News, in which someone is heard asking her, “Are you flying by yourself?” Henderson confirms that she is, and the person responds, “There’s a seat back there in aisle 34. It’s an aisle seat.” That’s when the recording stops, according to the report. Henderson’s ticket was for a window seat in row 15. Instead of standing her ground and refusing to give up the seat, Henderson complied out of fear of retaliation. “I don’t want to make it a race thing, but instead of asking the two white women that were seated next to me [to move], in an attempt to accommodate them, they basically made me have to move,” she said. “I just don’t know why I had to move because that was the seat that I paid for; that was my assigned seat.” Henderson said the walk to the back of the plane was humiliating. “As I’m walking back there, it’s just humiliating,” she said of the experience. “It’s like having the entire flight look at you and asking what’s going on.” After the flight, Henderson attempted to file a complaint with Delta customer service but was told the matter was out of their hands. The customer service representative actually seemed a bit perplexed about the motive behind her complaint. Henderson said the rep asked her, “How were you humiliated for them to ask you to go to another seat?” Delta released the following statement to ABC7 in response to Henderson’s experience: “We are looking into this situation to better understand what happened. Delta has no tolerance for discrimination in any form and these allegations run counter to our deeply-held values of respecting and honoring the diversity of our customers.” “I just want them to acknowledge that they made me feel powerless, and they can’t do that to customers moving forward,” Henderson said. “Me, as a Black woman, I was displaced to make two white women comfortable. That doesn’t make any sense to me.” TheGrio is now FREE on your TV via Apple TV, Amazon Fire, Roku, and Android TV. Also, please download theGrio mobile apps today!
