5/1/2022,"Boris Johnson’s claim that a lack of knowledge about the asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 put care homes at risk has been further undermined after it emerged he openly discussed the potential scale of symptom-free transmission. The prime minister has already been accused of misleading parliament over the claim. He made it last week after the high court ruled that the government had acted unlawfully in ordering the discharge of patients to care homes without testing in the spring of 2020. Johnson told the House of Commons: “What we didn’t know in particular was that Covid could be transmitted asymptomatically.” However, the prime minister commented on papers examining the issue at a Covid press conference on 25 March – several weeks before rules were altered to ensure that all patients were tested before they were admitted to a care home. At the press conference, he asked chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance about reports that many people could have the disease without symptoms. “Patrick, on the numbers of people who have the disease asymptomatically, there was a study I saw quoted from some Oxford academics saying that as many as 50% may have had it asymptomatically,” he said. “How do you evaluate that at this stage?” Vallance said studies in China and Italy had pointed to asymptomatic cases but the role of those cases at a population-wide level was unknown. He also said that new antibody tests would “be able to work out how many people have had the disease asymptomatically, and that’s going to be important to understand what to do next”. He added: “These tests are crucially important. We need more of them.” Care homes emerged as a major casualty in the first Covid wave. In mid-March 2020, NHS England had told hospitals to “urgently discharge” patients to help free 15,000 beds. Compulsory tests were not introduced for discharged patients until 15 April. About 25,000 patients were discharged to care homes in the intervening period. Last week’s high court judgment listed several occasions in early 2020 when the risk of asymptomatic transmission was raised by scientists and ministers. A submission from the government’s own lawyers stated that “there can be no doubt that [the government] understood that it was possible that asymptomatic people could bring the virus into care homes”. A government spokesman responded to the findings by stating the court “recognised this was a very difficult decision at the start of the pandemic, evidence on asymptomatic transmission was uncertain”. Martin Green, chief executive of Care England, said that even if there was not proof of asymptomatic transmission, ministers should have erred on the side of caution, as the risks were known. “The Sage government advisory committee had identified the issue of asymptomatic transmissions in early 2020, but if there was any doubt about issues relating to transmission pathways then this should have led to a clear directive that no one should be transferred between any health and care settings without a Covid test.” Johnson also acknowledged, in a press conference on 18 March, the problems the virus posed. “The thing about this disease, it’s an invisible enemy and we don’t know who’s transmitting it, but the great thing about having a test to see whether you’ve had it or not is suddenly a green light goes on above your head.” If he did not understand that meant people without obvious symptoms might be among those transmitting the virus, other people were on hand to point it out. Lord Bethell, then a junior health minister, was explicit about this during a Lords debate on 9 March 2020 about the government’s first Covid regulations, which created the power to keep people in isolation if they posed a risk. He told members: “Large numbers of people are infected and infectious but completely asymptomatic and never go near a test kit.” At that point, the public was told that the incubation period for Covid could be as long as 14 days, and most people did not develop symptoms until about three to five days after . There was no proof at that stage how Covid was transmitted, – prompting advice about handwashing rather than mask-wearing – but the high level of infectiousness and the possibility of asymptomatic transmission were being actively discussed by scientists and commentators. The Imperial College report that was so influential to the government’s initial response to the virus – and which led to the widespread antipathy among lockdown sceptics towards its chief author, Professor Neil Ferguson – stated that they assumed “symptomatic individuals are 50% more infectious than asymptomatic individuals”. A government spokesperson said was “being clear about the understanding of the virus changing over time and that it changed significantly day by day, particularly at the start of the pandemic”. They said the “vast majority” of last week’s court judgment found in the government’s favour and that evidence on asymptomatic transmission was “extremely uncertain”. They added: “Our thoughts are with all those who lost loved ones during the pandemic. Throughout the pandemic,our aim has been to protect the public from the threat to life and health posed by Covid-19 and we specifically sought to safeguard care home residents based on the best information at the time.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson’s defence on Covid risk to care homes hit by new revelation,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/30/boris-johnsons-defence-on-covid-risk-to-care-homes-hit-by-new-revelation
5/1/2022,"At the mouth of Milford Sound, the car parks sit empty. Of the 40 spaces reserved for convoys of buses, just two are occupied. The cliffs, rising sheer from dark, still water, are capped by mist, waterfalls unravelling like twine, nothing to interrupt the view. The cruise ships that once appeared over the horizon haven’t visited in years. When the ferry sets off, an entire floor of vinyl seats sits unoccupied. These are the last days of New Zealand’s forced isolation from the world’s tourists, and even Milford Sound/Piopiotahi, considered the crown jewel of New Zealand’s natural landscapes, is sparsely attended. Its beauty has long made it one of the country’s biggest tourism draws. Despite being extraordinarily remote – no mobile phone service or wifi, no clusters of shops and restaurants, one road in and out – Milford Sound welcomed almost 900,000 visitors in 2019, to a settlement with a permanent population of fewer than 200. The year the pandemic hit, it was expected to surpass 1 million. In a few days, the drawbridge will creak down, and tourists from around the world will be welcomed back. The government has been at pains to attract visitors, with prime minister Jacinda Ardern embarking on her first international trip in two years to say the country was “open for business”. But it is also in the midst of a reckoning over what its tourism future should look like – and a growing sense that things shouldn’t go back to the way they were. The central conundrum plagues many scenic tourism spots: people are drawn to isolation, tranquillity, untouched beauty – then their presence can jeopardise the very qualities that drew them there in the first place. In Tripadvisor reviews from Milford’s pre-pandemic days, two themes feature over and over: the beauty of the place, and the peak-season crowds. “The place was heaving,” one tourist wrote. “Literally hundreds of people in all directions.” “Hordes of people,” said another. “Don’t come here to experience this beautiful place in isolation.” “It is incomparably gorgeous and awe-inspiring. It is also a tourist machine. Huge numbers of people arrive here daily via buses, planes, cars and helicopters,” a visitor concluded. “Everything that is wonderful and horrible about tourism.” Over the past decade, New Zealand has become acutely aware of the “wonderful and horrible” of tourism. Before Covid, tourism was the country’s biggest export, accounting for 20% of the export market and approaching 10% of GDP. Returning visitors will be a crucial shot in the arm for cafes, restaurants and tourism operators that have spent two years struggling to survive. But tourism also caused tensions – locals complained of overcrowding, littering, lack of investment in infrastructure to host people, and the fear that fragile natural environments are being permanently damaged. The era of Instagram and influencers can throw those dynamics into overdrive. Locations moved at warp speed from “undiscovered gem” to endlessly replicated backdrop, engulfed – and often threatened – by eager visitors. “We want people to come to these incredible places. We want people to experience them. But we also want to make sure that we’re protecting them,” said Kiritapu [Kiri] Allan, minister for conservation and associate minister for culture and heritage. “And that we can hand it over to the next generations in a state that hasn’t been completely destroyed by a human footprint.” Now the government wants to reshape the way the country does tourism altogether. Last July, Stuart Nash, the tourism minister, vowed that the days of unlimited tour buses would never return to Piopiotahi. Beyond that, the site would be a “test case” for the rest of the country, he said, as it tries to remake its tourism sector into a more sustainable, controlled operation, that funds infrastructure in the communities that host it. In Milford, the proposals are significant: controlling entry, capping numbers, charging a standard infrastructure fee for a visit. Allan said the tensions are stark in Milford, but it’s a national conundrum. “I’m seeing similar strains across the rest of the country.” In Te Anau, Milford’s nearest town, absence of visitors during the pandemic has driven many businesses to the edge of collapse. About 85% of Piopiotahi’s visitors are from overseas, said Paul Norris, chief conservation officer of RealNZ, which runs ferry tours in the sound. Losing them was an immense economic shock. “It’s been survival mode,” he said. “You can imagine, the last two years, there’s been an awful lot of people who have left the tourism industry.” “I don’t think it should go back to the way it was. But like everything – behind four or five words, there’s a multitude of layers of things that were happening,” he said. Many of the discussions have been dominated by the peak season, which is really only a few weeks of the year, he added – in the winter months, things are more manageable. Muriel Johnstone, an elder of Ōraka Aparima Rūnaka, said the fjords are a “cradle of mythology” for the tribe – and its importance to Māori has not been reflected in the way it has operated. “Over many years, mana whenua [those with traditional authority over the land] and others have been concerned by the intensification of tourism,” she said. “Huge uncontrolled growth… has diminished the sense of awe and welcome that used to greet visitors.” Mana whenua must be placed at the heart of the new vision for Piopiotahi, she said– and it is Māori principals like manaakitanga [hospitality], and kaitiakitanga, [stewardship of the natural world] that can guide it forward. Out in the basin of the fjord, the ferry does a slow turn, making its way back to the harbour. The water stretches out ahead of it, unbroken. “This is about as good as it gets,” said one man, standing at the railing. In the wake, dolphins ripple through the water. As the boat approaches an enormous waterfall, a boy stands at the bow, feeling the spray on his face. His father stands behind him, taking a photograph. There’s little competition for the perfect shot.",News/World news,New Zealand seeks a greener kind of tourism as it reopens borders after Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/30/new-zealand-seeks-a-greener-kind-of-tourism-as-it-reopens-borders-after-covid
5/1/2022,"Alex Hales could be a second blacklisted player in the England fold this summer after Rob Key said the opener should be considered available for selection. The 33-year-old has not played international cricket since failing a recreational drugs test on the eve of the 2019 World Cup and losing the trust of Eoin Morgan, England’s all-powerful limited-overs captain, in the process. Ed Smith, the former national selector, had floated the idea of Hales training with the England squad last summer only to lose his job before it could be set up. Morgan may still have a view here but Key, the new managing director of men’s cricket, believes three years out is long enough. Key said: “I will have to speak to the people involved in that decision but I would have Alex Hales available for selection. I think he has done his time. But does that mean he gets in the team? That is a different debate.” Hales, who has been prodigious on the global Twenty20 circuit since being dropped by England, is the second Nottinghamshire batsman to be offered a potential lifeline after Key name-checked Joe Clarke as a player of promise in his first press conference at Lord’s on Thursday. Clarke, 25, has long been tipped for international honours but has had a line put through his name after he was caught up in the 2019 court case when his former Worcestershire teammate, Alex Hepburn, was jailed for rape. The Court heard that Clarke was involved in a WhatsApp group with Hepburn and Tom Kohler-Cadmore, another former teammate, in which sexual encounters were the subject of a points-scoring system. The judge labelled it “a pathetic, sexist game” which “demeaned women and trivialised rape”. Clarke and Kohler-Cadmore apologised after the England and Wales Cricket Board issued £2,000 fines, four-match bans and sent the pair on an educational training course. But while the former was placed on standby for the recent Caribbean Test tour, a full call-up this summer – possibly in England’s white-ball team, based on his strong T20 form – would likely still invite much criticism.Clarke was reprimanded for bringing the game into disrepute and issued a written apology.",Sport/Sport,Rob Key hints at open door for Alex Hales to make England return,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/30/rob-key-hints-at-open-door-for-alex-hales-to-make-england-return
5/1/2022,"The average English adult in the 1890s was about four inches shorter than today, and perhaps nowhere is this more evident that when trying to navigate one’s way around Goodison Park. The ceilings are low, the doorways and gangways narrow, the seating evidently designed with the more compact late-Victorian posterior in mind. But intimacy also breeds intensity. When the place is full and firing the noise builds and never stops building; nothing is lost and nothing is wasted, and if you are an opposition player caught in the din it can sometimes feel like the touchlines are closing in on you. Of course, and in more ways than one, Everton arguably outgrew Goodison some years ago. Two miles away at Bramley-Moore, a new 52,000-seat cathedral is rising from the docklands, an imposing monument to a club finally ready to shed its past. Not so long ago it felt like a logical next step; now it feels more like a gleaming anomaly. With six games to play, Everton are 18th in the Premier League and facing the very real possibility that they may be constructing the most spectacular stadium in the Championship. Six games to decide this and probably a lot more besides. As Everton’s plight has gradually sharpened, there has been an impulse from many fans, pundits and media outlets to reduce this story to a single personal soap opera: one largely contingent on whether you like Frank Lampard or not. But relegation from the top flight for the first time in more than seven decades would have far wider implications for Everton, its staff, its people and its city. Everton fan and former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher is only slightly exaggerating when he describes the effect as akin to a bereavement. Part of the reason there is such a sensation of ultimacy to all this is that if Everton fall into the abyss, there can be no guarantees beyond that. The pandemic cost Everton around £170m and over the past three years the club has posted losses of approximately£255m: well over the limit allowed under the Premier League’s sustainability rules. Wages are at almost 90% of turnover, while the cost of financing and materials for the new stadium has rocketed due to inflationary pressures and the war in Ukraine. The financial backing of Alisher Usmanov, which amounted to around £10m a year in sponsorships and exclusive naming rights for the new stadium, no longer exists as a result of his sanctioning by the UK government. The point is that Everton were already teetering on the precipice of catastrophe before their Premier League status came under threat. Nobody really knows what the repercussions of relegation might be. The best-case scenario is that a streamlined, refocused Everton bounce straight back to the Premier League and move seamlessly to their new stadium with a spring in their step and a sense of rebirth. The worst-case scenario: take your pick from administration, decimation, perhaps even Sunderland-style back-to-back relegations. Rival fans will surely note the irony in a club that was instrumental in the 1992 Premier League breakaway and whose owner, Philip Carter, once moaned about being “required to subsidise clubs in the lower divisions” becoming reliant on parachute payments. Meanwhile current owner Farhad Moshiri has spent in excess of £600m on the club since his arrival six years ago and for all his missteps and misjudgements remains the only real buffer between Everton and oblivion. What if he decides to stop bankrolling a listing ship, throwing money at this giant white elephant? The club insists that financing for the stadium is secure, although debt repayments will continue to eat into the club’s finances for decades. But very little else is. In the event of relegation it is hard to imagine a single player for whom Everton would not entertain a decent offer, in the hope of trimming a wage bill that is still the seventh highest in the country. Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Anthony Gordon, Jordan Pickford, Richarlison, Yerry Mina, Dele Alli, Abdoulaye Doucouré, Allan, Fabian Delph: naturally some will be more likely to find a buyer than others, and some will be mourned by Everton fans more than others. Some may need to go even if Everton survive. But one way or another, for better and worse, this squad is about to undergo some pretty major surgery. And what of Lampard? The temptation will be to stick with him even in the Championship given his experience with Derby, the club he took from sixth place to sixth place after signing Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori on loan. But for all the systemic ruin Lampard inherited – a shattered and enfeebled team who had somehow forgotten to pass the ball – Everton were still 16th when he took over. They have 10 points from their last 12 matches. The only one of Everton’s last 13 opponents not to have more possession than them was Boreham Wood in the FA Cup. Only the most dogged of optimists – and Lampard is nothing if not one of those – can spin this as any sort of progress. In other words, everyone here is drinking in the last chance saloon: Lampard, the players, Moshiri, chairman Bill Kenwright who remains responsible for … something, presumably. All of which, paradoxically, might generate a certain clarity of purpose. Everton have those six games left. Three of them, crucially, will be at home. Enter Goodison. Some of Everton’s older fans will fondly recall the final day of the 1993-94 season, the club’s last real flirtation with relegation, when the Goodison roar helped to overturn a seemingly irretrievable 2-0 deficit against Wimbledon. Everton have been hopeless away from home all season. It is upon these three remaining home games – Crystal Palace, Brentford and first Chelsea on Sunday afternoon – that their future will rest. It would be both bitterly ironic and entirely appropriate if the biggest symbol of Everton’s past ended up securing their immediate future.",Sport/Football,Survival of Everton and Lampard may hinge on creaking Goodison Park | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/30/survival-of-everton-and-lampard-may-hinge-on-creaking-goodison-park
5/1/2022,"Rob Key sympathised with Ashley Giles when he spoke at Lord’s on Thursday, acknowledging the challenge his predecessor had faced with the global pandemic. The new director of England men’s cricket is starting a great repeal of his policies and coaching structure, however, with the ailing Test team given immediate priority. After a single all-format coach under Giles, one lumped with selection in the final throes of the old regime, come two as-yet unnamed head coaches for Test and white-ball cricket; budgets permitting, separate coaching teams too. Key said the two chiefs will probably rarely cross paths and the search for a new national selector, a role described as “antiquated” by Giles after making Ed Smith redundant last year, is also under way. Split head coaches should probably have come sooner but then Giles was burned back in the day, the junior white-ball partner to Andy Flower’s Test supremo from late 2012 to early 2014. Giles felt he got second dibs on resources, Flower power was ultimately at its greatest and, by the end, after England were whitewashed in the Ashes and flunked a World T20 in Bangladesh, both men at least agreed it hadn’t worked. Key, however, is prepared to try again and looking ahead to next winter – a solid block of touring from September to March that features trips to Pakistan, South Africa, Bangladesh and the small matter of a T20 World Cup in Australia – his hand has practically been forced. Communication will be a paramount and Key will play King Solomon if there is a dispute over who gets what. It is clear the Test side will come first after last year’s well-intended but inflexible rotation shemozzle. “We know that the T20 World Cup is there on the schedule,” said Key. “But at the moment the focus is solely getting this Test team up and running. That can go all the way through to the end of the South Africa series [in September] I think. There will be series in white-ball cricket [a short tour of the Netherlands in June, plus the visits of India and South Africa in July] where you have the mainstay of the squad but not the absolute best XI. But I don’t think that’s a bad thing. “You have to make it clear to the coaches when they take this job. You might be the white-ball coach, but that does not mean having the luxury of the multi-format cricketers every single game. That’s not a bad thing because there is a chance we could sustain that set-up for longer by younger players coming in. We can still hit the World Cup all guns blazing.” England’s national teams are starting to become increasingly separated. With Moeen Ali retired from Test cricket and Dawid Malan and Jos Buttler also out of the frame, it leaves Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow, Chris Woakes and Mark Wood as the main multi-format players. Saqib Mahmood may also be coveted by both head coaches in time but Jofra Archer is unlikely to play Tests this summer, his return from elbow surgery due to start in limited-overs cricket. Another reason for Key splitting the role is to broaden his options. The franchise T20 world offers highly paid roles with plenty of time at home and so to compete, the work-life balance for an England job must be similarly appealing. The Test role, he believes, should be hugely attractive regardless, despite five successive winless series for the first time in the team’s 145-year history. “We all think it would be great to take on the white-ball team,” he said. “They won the World Cup and are one of the best teams in [Twenty20 cricket]. But actually the red-ball team, if you are a coach and your ambition is to improve players and teams, there’s no better [project] to take on than England.” Interviews for the head coach roles will begin on 9 May and one of the first questions a panel of Key, Tom Harrison and Andrew Strauss will ask Test candidates is how they intend to complement Stokes. Appointing the captain first, he said, provides clarity here and any coach worth their salt should adapt to meet the all-rounder’s needs, covering off any weaknesses and ensuring he is not overburdened. Gary Kirsten, Graham Ford and Simon Katich appear to be vying for this role, while Key said Eoin Morgan, the limited-overs captain, will have a strong say in identifying the head coach from his experiences in the white-ball world. Unless Paul Collingwood is Morgan’s man here, it looks increasingly likely that both appointments will hail from overseas. “The majority of the names coming at you will be overseas coaches,” Key said. “[But] that can’t be right. That is a fault of the system. How many English coaches of the national side have we had in 30 years? Two or three? We have to sort that out.” Giles said the same when he hired Chris Silverwood, describing the lack of domestic options – bar his chosen man, obviously – as a “sorry state of affairs”. Once Key is done overhauling his predecessor’s England set-up, he will need to address a subject on which they agree.",Sport/Sport,Rob Key revolution begins as he aims to revive England Test team,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/30/rob-key-revolution-begins-as-he-aims-to-revive-england-test-team
5/1/2022,"It was announced on Friday that a consortium led by Los Angeles Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly has been selected as the preferred bidder in the race to buy Chelsea from Roman Abramovich. If the 46-year-old hedge fund billionaire can repeat the rescue job he has pulled off with the Dodgers over the past decade, it is an outcome that will suit Blues supporters just fine. In 2011, the Dodgers were among the most badly mismanaged teams in North American sports under Frank McCourt, the Boston real estate developer who had bought the franchise and the surrounding Chavez Ravine land from Rupert Murdoch’s Fox Entertainment Group seven years earlier. Although McCourt retained sole ownership of the Dodgers after a high-profile divorce in 2009, Major League Baseball assumed day-to-day control of operations less than two years later with the MLB commissioner, Bud Selig, citing “his deep concerns regarding the finances and operations” of the debt-ridden club. That all ended 10 years ago this Sunday when Guggenheim Baseball Management – a group of investors that included Boehly, Mark Walter and the LA Lakers legend Magic Johnson – completed their purchase of the Dodgers for $2.15bn in a sale overseen by a bankruptcy court, nearly doubling the previous record sale price for a sports team in North America (a reported $1.1bn for the NFL’s Miami Dolphins in 2009) and globally (the Glazer family’s 2005 takeover of Manchester United, then valued at $1.47bn). The stunning coup lay to waste rival bids from the Arsenal owner, Stan Kroenke, and a hedge fund billionaire, Steve Cohen, who went on to buy the New York Mets for a record $2.42bn in October 2020. What followed in California is one of the most dramatic reversals of fortune in the annals of North American sports. Within two years, having restored the club to respectability, Boehly marshalled an $8.35bn deal between Time Warner Cable and the Dodgers to create SportsNet LA, a regional network that carried all Dodgers games. Much of that cash immediately flowed back into the insurance funds that were leveraged to buy the team and reinvested in payroll. It has been nine years since they have missed out on the postseason. The Dodgers, who had dropped out of the top 10 in annual payroll under McCourt’s ownership and were being outbid by small-market clubs on the free-agent market, have since eclipsed the New York Yankees as baseball’s biggest spenders, reinvested in their stadium, repaired badly frayed ties with the city and, crucially, ended the club’s 32-year championship drought with their 2020 World Series triumph. The Dodgers purchase was just the start of Boehly’s move into sports ownership. He bought an interest in the WNBA’s Los Angeles Sparks shortly afterwards and last year teamed up with Walter to purchase a 27% stake of the Los Angeles Lakers, the NBA’s third-highest valued team with an estimated worth of $5.14bn. Boehly is also reportedly among the five initial bidders to purchase the NFL’s Denver Broncos. When he first approached Abramovich to purchase Chelsea three years ago in a bid that was rejected – after a previous failed bid for Tottenham – Boehly explained why he wanted a Premier League club for his portfolio. “Football’s the biggest sport in the world, the passion the fans have for the sport and the teams is unparalleled,” Boehly told Bloomberg in 2019. “So what you are trying to build with these teams, you are really trying to a) win and b) be part of the community. “The opportunity we had with the Dodgers was really about part-ownership with Los Angeles, how are we going to win, how are we going to drive championships and how are we going to build passion. If you look at what the Premier League offers, it’s all of those things. “One of the great things the Premier League has is that it’s on a Saturday morning in America. So you have an uncongested time slot that is now fully dominated by the Premier League. NBC has done an amazing job bringing that content. “When I was growing up, [there was] Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, but certainly I didn’t know about Manchester United, I didn’t know about Chelsea, I didn’t know about Tottenham. Kids these days are fully aware of what’s the best and the Premier League is the best. I continue to believe there is global opportunity for the best clubs.” His experience leaning into turmoil is not limited to the sports world. Last year, with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association facing an existential crisis after NBC dropped its flagship Golden Globes telecast after allegations of self-dealing, ethical lapses and an alarming lack of diversity, it was Boehly who was appointed as interim CEO. Boehly, who studied at the London School of Economics and whose private equity firm, Eldrige Industries, operates a portfolio of businesses across the sports, media, real estate development and hospitality industries, has operated as the man behind the curtain with the Dodgers, certainly relative to the more front-facing Walter and Johnson. Now it has been reported that Boehly would be the most influential figure in the running of Chelsea, a role it appears he is well prepared for after a decade behind the scenes of some of the most prominent clubs across all sports.",Sport/Football,Revival of LA Dodgers under Todd Boehly bodes well for Chelsea,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/30/todd-boehly-chelsea-takeover-la-dodgers-lakers
5/1/2022,"Neil Parish, the Tory MP who has said he will resign after admitting watching pornography in the House of Commons, has a strong interest in farming, the countryside and animal welfare issues. The announcement on Saturday of his planned resignation comes after a 12-year parliamentary career in which the MP for Tiverton and Honiton had rarely – if ever – been elevated to national importance. A farmer and former member of the European parliament for south-west England, and a councillor before that, Parish, 65, was part of the 2010 parliamentary intake when he won what has increasingly become a safe Tory seat. Since then, he had avoided controversy and has served since 2015 as chair of the environment, food and rural affairs select committee (Efra). Before entering politics, Parish managed the family farm in Somerset after leaving school at 16. He was elected to the European parliament in 1999 but did not stand for re-election in 2009, having already been selected as the Conservative candidate for Tiverton and Honiton at the 2010 general election. He was subsequently elected with a majority of 24,239 over the Labour party. Parish is married to Sue, 66, who he employs as a junior secretary, and they have two children, Jonathan and Harriet, and two grandchildren. His leisure interests include music and swimming. The MP’s website also lists “the politics of Africa” as being among his other interests, adding that a ban on him re-entering Zimbabwe after he criticised Robert Mugabe’s regime in his capacity as an election monitor remained in place to this day.

5/1/2022,"Jürgen Klopp offered a masterclass in rotation as his gamble in refreshing Liverpool’s quadruple-pursuing side paid off with a vital victory at Newcastle. Naby Keïta’s 19th-minute goal ensured they continue to breathe down Manchester City’s necks at the top of the Premier League. Klopp juggled his priorities in a game sandwiched between a two-leg Champions League semi-final with Villarreal. “The changes were cool, the selection game is so important” said Liverpool’s manager after making five changes to the side that started last week’s home win against Villarreal. “The squad is the only reason why we are where we are. All the boys buy completely into the situation. “The boys that didn’t come on, you should have seen their faces on the final whistle. The group is exceptional, exceptionally talented and really good characters.” With Mohamed Salah and Thiago Alcântara among those starting on the bench, Klopp included the 36-year-old James Milner in his starting XI and was left saluting his “role model” as Newcastle’s run of six successive home wins was brought to an end. Milner, once a Newcastle player, made his Premier League debut for Leeds almost 20 years ago and excelled on this return to a former stamping ground. Asked if he had come across a fitter 36-year-old, Klopp said with a smile: “No, but it would be interesting to look at Luka Modric. Is he not 36 as well? It was obviously a good generation. It’s difficult to be fitter than Milly. “He’s a role model. I have told him, I can tell the whole world – nothing we have achieved in the last few years would have happened without James Milner, it’s as easy as that. “Whether he was on the pitch or not, he’s set standards in a way not a lot of people can set standards, and it educated all of us. Milly played a great game today. I loved this game – and he played a massive part in it.” As Milner helped Liverpool extend their unbeaten Premier League run to 15 games, Klopp, fresh from signing a contract extension at Anfield, emphasised the difficulties involved in competing on so many demanding fronts. “It was incredibly difficult for the boys today, to be honest; we played two and a half days ago,” he said. “In the circumstances it was a top class performance. We did 100% against a team in top form in a top atmosphere. I’m really happy. For me it’s been a top week.” As Klopp’s attention turned to Tuesday’s Champions League second leg in Spain, Eddie Howe was reminded that, for all Newcastle’s radical improvement since he succeeded Steve Bruce in November, there is still much work to be done. “I’d say there’s been progress,” said Howe, who has steered a once apparently doomed team well clear of relegation danger. “We’ve improved in a lot of aspects of our play, but it shows also there’s a gap that we have to bridge to the top teams. But I’m not surprised by that – I don’t think anyone else is. We have work to do. “The biggest disappointment probably is individually. I don’t think we really excelled. The team was OK, we were in the game right to the end, but to win these games, you need probably six or seven performers right at their top levels, and that wasn’t there. It was close, but it wasn’t close enough. We weren’t a genuine counter-attacking threat. We weren’t quite there.”",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp praises ‘role model’ James Milner after Liverpool win with rotation,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/30/jurgen-klopp-praises-role-model-james-milner-after-liverpool-win-with-rotation
