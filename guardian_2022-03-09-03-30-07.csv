3/9/2022,"Russia’s surprisingly chaotic attack on Kyiv has seen thousands of troops and hundreds of vehicles stuck on the roads to the north-west for several days – but several military analysts believe Moscow is gradually overcoming its logistics problems and could be able to mount an assault on the capital within days. The influential Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based thinktank, concluded on Tuesday evening that Russian forces were now “concentrating in the eastern, north-western and western outskirts of Kyiv” in preparation for an “assault on the capital in the coming 24-96 hours”. Its success, the thinktank added, will depend in part on how effectively Russian troops have been able to “resupply, reorganise and plan” after an initial invasion that experts believe fell apart due to flawed assumptions – where the military did not, in the first instance, prepare for a strategic ground offensive against a determined and hostile Ukraine. “No part of the military operation looked rational or what you would expect them to do,” said Michael Kofman, director of the Russia studies programme at the CNA thinktank. Lightly armoured units outran air cover, making failed attempts to march into both Kyiv and Kharkiv in the first days of the conflict, reflecting, Kofman said, that soldiers were “told they were going to help Ukraine liberate themselves”. What then happened, to the north-west of Kyiv, was that one of the Russian columns heading towards the capital – a vast, 40-mile long force of about 15,000 troops – appeared to become stuck, with vehicles running out of fuel or breaking down. This created a large traffic jam which – because of the limited available roads and muddy surrounding countryside – was hard to untangle. Social media images of military vehicles stuck in the mud prompted one expert to suggest that the Russian army had engaged in “poor truck management practices”, where vehicles had been left parked for so long that the tyre sidewalls had become brittle or had even rotted, meaning they were vulnerable to puncture. But, speaking at an event organised by the Rusi (Royal United Services Institute) thinktank, Kofman said he believed “the logistics problem is oversold” and the problem faced by the invaders was more basic – that it was “extremely hard to undo” the traffic jam problem once it emerged. “Militaries often have to learn problems the hard way,” he added. Gradually, experts believe, Russia has become more careful about keeping its troops within the protection of its air defences – while at the same time, the problems of the north-west, arguably the most direct invasion route to the capital, have not necessarily been replicated elsewhere. Russian forces appear to be advancing to the east of the capital to the suburb of Brovary, according to video posted on social media on Tursday, in a developing attempt to encircle the capital. And, despite the logistics problems in the north-west, Ukrainian forces have not been able to make a significant attempt to destroy the advancing convoy, partly due the limited air power available to Kyiv’s armed forces. The next few days are likely to be critical. Nick Reynolds, a land warfare expert at Rusi, said he believed that while the Russian military will not have solved its logistical problems, efforts will have been made to resupply at least part of the invading forces. “The question is whether it will be in sufficiently good shape to attempt to complete the encirclement of Kyiv,” Reynolds said, “given the physical and psychological hammering that their forces have taken while they were in a state of confused disorganisation.”",News/World news,Russia ‘solving logistics problems’ and could attack Kyiv within days – experts ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/russia-solving-logistics-problems-and-could-attack-kyiv-within-days-experts
3/9/2022,"The president of Ukraine echoed Winston Churchill and invoked the fight against Nazism as he made a direct plea to Britain to do more to help protect his country in the fight against the Russian invasion. In an unprecedented and emotional speech broadcast live to the House of Commons, Volodymyr Zelenskiy channelled Churchill when he told a packed chamber: “We will continue fighting for our land, whatever the cost. We will fight in the forests, the fields, the shores and in the streets.” Ukraine “will not lose” to Russia, he vowed. Zelenskiy, who received long ovations from MPs before and after his speech, also cited Shakespeare to describe the plight of his country under Russian invasion, saying it was a question of “to be or not to be”. “For 13 days this question could have been asked but now I can give you a definitive answer. It’s definitely yes, to be,” he said, according to a translation of his speech, which was delivered in Ukrainian and broadcast live from Kyiv. “And I would like to remind you the words that the United Kingdom has already heard, which are important again. We will not give up and we will not lose.” He told MPs that after nearly two weeks of war, during which time hundreds of Ukrainian civilians have been killed, resolve remained strong. “Just the same way you once didn’t want to lose your country when the Nazis started to fight your country and you had to fight for Britain. Thirteen days of this struggle ... at four o’clock in the morning we were attacked by cruise missiles.” Zelenskiy reiterated calls for more UK support, including repeating a call for a no-fly zone, which Nato countries have declined to impose over fears it could trigger another world war. “We are thankful for this help and I am grateful to you Boris,” he said, addressing the prime minister by name. “Please increase the pressure of sanctions against this country [Russia] and please recognise this country as a terrorist country. Please make sure that our Ukrainian skies are safe. Please make sure that you do what needs to be done and what is stipulated by the greatness of your country.” Responding to Zelenskiy, Boris Johnson hailed the Ukrainian president as a leader “standing firm for democracy and freedom – in his righteous defiance I believe he has moved the hearts of everybody in this house”. Saying he would “employ every method” to squeeze Russia with sanctions, Johnson said the UK would continue to supply weapons to Ukraine. “At this moment, ordinary Ukrainians are defending their homes and their families against a brutal assault, and they are by their actions inspiring millions with their courage and their devotion,” he said. Because of Commons procedures, the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, halted the formal business of the day for Zelenskiy’s speech, and Johnson and other party leaders responded with points of order.",News/World news,Zelenskiy invokes Churchill as he calls on UK to do more to help Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/zelenskiy-invokes-churchill-calls-on-uk-do-more-help-ukraine
3/9/2022,"Health experts have widely denounced Florida’s decision to recommend against Covid-19 vaccinations for children, describing it as “irresponsible”, “reckless” and “dangerous”. In a pronouncement which stunned experts on Monday, Florida’s controversial surgeon general Dr Joseph Lapado said the state would be the first to “recommend against” Covid-19 vaccination for “healthy children”. The move followed two recent Covid-19 surges in which pediatric hospitalization was believed to be higher because of low vaccination rates among children. “It’s very generous to call it a recommendation, because recommendations come with supporting evidence and transparency,” said Saad B Omer, director of the Yale Institute of Global Health and professor of medicine in infectious diseases. “Trying to interpret that is trying to create a GPS map from a dream. You don’t know where it’s coming from, what is the scientific rationale, if any,” said Omer. The announcement is “irresponsible … it is inappropriate and it is dangerous”, he said. Lapado made the announcement on Monday at the end of a roundtable discussion hosted by Republican governor Ron DeSantis, saying: “The Florida department of health is going to be the first state to officially recommend against the Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children.” The state has not yet released a formal policy to describe exactly who would be included in the designation “healthy children”. The move goes against accepted advice from federal health authorities and a large majority of independent experts, who recommend vaccines as a powerful tool to protect children from the worst outcomes of Covid-19. The roundtable came as Covid-19 cases driven by the Omicron variant fall and federal health authorities seek to wind down pandemic prevention measures such as masking and social distancing. Although children face much lower risks from Covid-19 than older adults, “there is a small minority who don’t do well with the infection and recent CDC data showed vaccines prevent half of urgent care and hospital visits,” said Dr Kawsar Talaat, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “Our kids have lost a lot during the pandemic, and vaccines are one thing we can do to help give them a sense of normalcy.” The Delta and Omicron Covid waves brought record-high levels of pediatric hospitalizations. These variants were not believed to be more dangerous to children. Instead, experts believe more children were hospitalized because they have low vaccination rates relative to the rest of the US population. “Covid-19 is in the top 10 causes of deaths for every age group. That’s why we’re recommending the vaccines for everyone ages five and older,” said Noel Brewer, a behavioral scientist and professor at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Public Health. “No one needs these folks in Florida establishing policies around vaccines – they simply lack the expertise to do this well,” said Brewer, who is also a member of the Lancet Commission on Vaccine Refusal, Acceptance, and Demand in the US. “People deliberately sowing doubt about Covid-19 vaccines undermines confidence and uptake in the vaccine,” said Brewer. “One of the clear effects of anti-vaccine propaganda is it harms the public. This announcement by the state of Florida is not helping anything. It will not save lives – in fact, it will cause more people to die.” Nationally, just 26% of children aged five to 11 and 57% of adolescents aged 12-17 are fully vaccinated. Comparatively, 65% of the US population is vaccinated. In Florida, 66% of people are vaccinated, though coverage varies widely throughout the state. The FDA authorized vaccines for adolescents in spring 2021 and for young children in the fall. In January, the FDA also authorized a booster dose for adolescents aged 12-15. The CDC has also recommended vaccines for these age groups, as independent expert advisory panels to both the FDA and CDC. Children younger than five are not eligible for a vaccine. “This has been looked at independently by four groups of experts and for a very good reason, because during this Delta and Omicron wave we’ve seen unprecedented numbers of pediatric hospitalization,” said Dr Peter Hotez, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine. Hotez is also developing a low-cost Covid vaccine. DeSantis has attacked Covid-19 prevention measures throughout the two years of the pandemic. At the same time, regular Floridians have suffered greatly. More than 71,000 people have died in the state, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), or 332 people for every 100,000 residents, far above the national average of 287 deaths per 100,000. By another metric, Florida would have the worst death rate in the world if it were a country. Hotez said many experts believe another wave of Covid, perhaps caused by a new variant, could hit the south and Florida this summer, “just like it did in 2020 and 2021”. Covid-19 “is a highly preventable death at this point,” said Talaat. “Almost nobody should be dying of Covid, especially over the last year and yet we’re almost at 1 million deaths in the US.”",News/US news,Experts condemn Florida plan to advise against Covid vaccine for healthy children,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/08/florida-children-vaccination-coronavirus
3/9/2022,"In Auckland a widower considers selling his home to get by; in Whakatane a mature student moves back in with his parents because he can’t afford to rent; in Wellington an early childhood teacher goes without food to pay the bills. As living costs balloon in New Zealand, so too are the sacrifices its citizens are making. Inflation in Aotearoa has hit a three-decade high, driven by an increase in petrol and housing costs. It is showing no sign of slowing – inflation hit 5.9% at the end of 2021, and ANZ, the country’s biggest bank, expects it to continue rising in 2022. The cost of living has grown by 5.2% for the average household within a year. “Everything is rising: groceries, a coffee at the local cafe, a burger at the wee pub down the road ($21), a car service at the local garage, a haircut,” says Wellingtonian Pal Andre Ricard, 49. “Putting living basic costs aside, the cost of rent and buying a house is off the rails … and wages are staying the same.” Walk into any supermarket and the prices of basic items can be eye-watering. For $100 you will get: a dozen eggs, a carton of milk, a loaf of bread, a block of cheese, a head of lettuce, a block of butter, a chicken, a bottle of wine and a box of nappies. Last week, in a blow to brassica lovers, cauliflowers were priced at a $15 a piece. Annual food prices have had the biggest increase since 2011, with a 4.5% spike between December 2020-2021. “The cost of groceries have risen quite rapidly,” Auckland resident Jijo James says. James, 28, says he used to pay $100 for a typical grocery shop before Covid-19 lockdowns, but a similar bundle now costs between $180 and $200. “I have stuck to buying only essential items and cut down on extra expenses,” he says. Bills like internet and electricity have also increased, James says. “But my income has remained the same, making it harder to save up for any potential emergencies. I went from being able to save some money every week to living pay cheque to pay cheque.” In a draft report last year, the Commerce Commission found New Zealand shoppers face some of the most expensive groceries in the OECD. The commission also found that profit margins at New Zealand supermarkets – which is dominated by a duopoly – were consistently higher than those of grocery chains internationally. The two big supermarket companies – Foodstuffs and Woolworths NZ – dominate wholesaling and distribution, which creates difficulties for other businesses to get competitively priced wholesale supplies. On Tuesday, the Commerce Commission revealed its final recommendations for what must be done to improve competition and affordability. It stopped short of breaking up the duopoly and forcing them to sell off some of their stores, opting instead for making more land available for new grocery stores by changing planning laws to free up sites. The competition regulator also called for the big players to improve access to wholesale supplies and prices for smaller players, and recommended the creation of a grocery sector regulator and dispute resolution scheme to resolve wholesale and supplier disputes. Anna Rawlings, chair of the Commerce Commission, said “competition in this sector is not working well for consumers”. “We think that the best way to improve conditions for competition is to enable the entry and extension of others within the sector by freeing up land for development, and by providing some further wholesale access to grocery supply.” The consumer affairs minister, David Clark, said the government would implement the recommendations. “New Zealanders are demonstratively paying too much in the checkout,” he said. “If we’re not seeing material changes in the sector then we will consider other measures.” Groceries are not the only area where people are feeling the pinch. Housing affordability is at a record low, with the average property now worth 8.8 times the average household income, according to property analysts CoreLogic. For those households, it would take nearly 12 years to save enough money for a deposit. Rent and household bills have also increased. Median rents nationwide have reached $540 a week, up by $50 from the previous year, while utilities rose 32% in the June 2021 quarter and petrol prices increased 30% in the year to December. Melanie Watterson, a 31-year-old from Wellington who is studying full-time and working part-time as an early childhood teacher, says the living costs are “overwhelming”. “To make sure I have power and household bills covered I’m left with very little, and often have to go without eating,” she says. “Managing financially when I was working full-time was difficult and since becoming a student one year ago it has become unmanageable. It’s very overwhelming.” When winter rolls around, those costs become “ten times harder”, she says. “Homes in New Zealand are often unhealthy, poorly insulated and have mould issues, so power bills end up being huge.” For Joshua Mainwaring in Whakatane, his income could cover his rent but not much else. “I like so many thirtysomethings have caved and ended up back with my parents,” he says. “I have been planning to go to university in Wellington but the cost of rent is so high there that I’m having to take a year off first to save money towards my living costs.” Even homeowners are struggling. Keith Marshall, a 74-year-old retiree and widower in Auckland, says he is of the generation that is “asset rich but cash poor”. His superannuation has increased marginally in the past few years, but not at a rate to match the rise in living costs. “I am not talking about daily coffees, brunches, dining out, takeaway food, online streaming services or buying the latest thing to have on a credit card,” he says. “I can afford none of those things. My one social outing per week is to see a film at a senior citizen’s rate.” Marshall monitors his spending thoroughly using spreadsheets but is still left with nothing at the end of the pay period. “Unfortunately, if this rate of inflation continues or grows, I cannot see how I can continue to live as I do now. What that may entail I dread to contemplate.” Over the weekend, the National party promised to scrap the government’s tax policies to help soften the blow of increasing costs of living, which its leader Christopher Luxon called a “crisis”. “The average kiwi family is worse off than they were 12 months ago and the government needs to act.” But the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, rejected the idea that New Zealand was in a rising costs crisis, saying global pressures were leading to high prices, not government policies. “Yes, these times are tough. We have seen the impact of inflation, but we have also seen people predict we’ll be coming out of that throughout this year. Things will start to get better and ease,” she told Newshub. “We are experiencing high inflation, as are many countries at the moment.”",News/World news,‘Everything is rising’: New Zealanders make painful sacrifices as living costs skyrocket,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/everything-is-rising-new-zealanders-make-painful-sacrifices-as-living-costs-skyrocket
3/9/2022,"An independent inquiry has called the former House of Commons Speaker John Bercow a “serial bully” and liar, saying it would have recommended his expulsion from the Commons had he been an MP. Bercow has been suspended from the Labour party over the conclusions of the inquiry, which came after his appeal against a report from the parliamentary commissioner for standards, Kathryn Stone. Campaigners and trade unions have hailed the report as a mark of progress for parliament’s complaints procedure, but Bercow called it a “kangaroo court” and said its findings were “amateurish”. The independent panel, chaired by former court of appeal judge Sir Stephen Irwin, upheld 21 out of 35 complaints against him by former staff and colleagues. Four made complaints, of which three had multiple complaints upheld and the fourth was judged to be a witness to bullying behaviour. The respondent’s conduct was so serious that, had he still been a member of parliament, we would have determined that he should be expelled by resolution of the house. As it is, we recommend that he should never be permitted a pass to the parliamentary estate. In relation to one complainant in particular, the panel found: [Bercow] has been widely unreliable and repeatedly dishonest in his evidence. He has attempted to defeat these complaints by false accusations of collusion and by advancing lies. It found there were denials, lack of any remorse and “repeated publicity in breach of the confidentiality of the process” including in Bercow’s autobiography. Three senior House of Commons staff made complaints against Bercow, as well as the former Black Rod, David Leakey, who was a witness. A former naval captain, Sinclair was Speaker’s Secretary under the previous Speaker and continued under Bercow until 2009 when he retired. He made seven allegations of bullying, of which four were upheld. The report concluded that Sinclair had been verbally abused and berated, with Bercow seeking to humiliate him in front of others. The most egregious display was described by the report as Bercow hurling a mobile phone at Sinclair over a disagreement about his use of the Speaker’s residence during the local elections – though Bercow later apologised. He ordered me to stay seated, so he was standing over me, and then threw the mobile phone right in front of me on my desk and it burst into hundreds of bits and I could feel them hitting me. It was the most violent, extraordinary display of temper. In another case, where Bercow was displeased with one of Sinclair’s responses to a press call, Sinclair said he was “berated for doing so and sworn at”. The Speaker calling him ‘fucking stupid’ and saying that he (the Speaker) did not give a ‘flying fuck’. In another case, Bercow is said to have cut short a meeting with the CEO of the UK’s Commonwealth Parliamentary Association claiming that Sinclair had not briefed him and criticised him in front of the CEO. He is also said to have told Sinclair “you fucking fix it that I’m on that panel” to choose the Speaker’s chaplain after it became clear his favoured candidate might not get the post. Sinclair described Bercow as being “furious beyond the normal reaction … swearing at the complainant, thumping the table and waving his arms, with spittle coming from his mouth”. Emms was Sinclair’s successor as Speaker’s Secretary and made seven allegations of bullying and harassment, of which three were upheld. Emms said her treatment in post made her seriously unwell through stress and anxiety, and she finally quit without notice. Her first complaint, about a work trip to Kenya, came after she warned Bercow he had an item in his hand luggage which would have to be checked in, describing his reaction as “irascible and disproportionately rude and threatening in his body language”, shouting at her in public. In another meeting, where there was a misunderstanding over a policy line, Emms described Bercow looking at her “as if he wanted to rip my guts out”. She described his response as “loud, insulting, personally abusive and a ‘really direct personal attack’. In the course of this attack, he mimicked Emms.” Emms said in a statement she was “supremely glad to be vindicated” by the report. The impacts of the one and only genuinely horrible, undermining and consistently upsetting period of my career has spread into all areas of my life. Stress, anxiety and loss of confidence sent me home on sick leave and affected how I saw myself and how I felt I was seen by family, friends and colleagues. Lisvane, who was then Sir Robert Rogers, was Clerk of the House until August 2014. He made 18 allegations of bullying and/or harassment against Bercow, of which 14 were upheld and two were concluded to be harassment. He said there were numerous fallings out over Bercow’s drive for diversity, including times when Bercow accused him of being “duplicitous, manipulative, of lying, and of bullying”. Another complaint detailed occasions describing Lisvane “personally as useless or hopeless, sometimes with profane language such as ‘fucking useless’.” A witness said that Lisvane was seriously undermined “often in front of junior staff”. He would refer to the complainant as being ‘posh’ and would belittle him in front of others … often mimicking him in a demeaning way or referring to his privileged background. At another meeting, Lisvane said that in front of others Bercow “suddenly launched an attack on his role as chief executive saying that the Commission made a mistake in appointing him and that he wanted to see his roles separated, with the appointment of a BAME woman as chief executive. [Bercow] sneered at the complainant, told him how hopeless he was and that he was not prepared to put up with white middle-aged men any more. In another incident, Lisvane discussed a BBC programme about MPs bullying staff where he suggested the House could not intervene. He described Bercow as going into “rant mode” and saying he wanted to avoid responsibility. The report found “this ‘rant’ was timed by the complainant as lasting 13 minutes”. Leakey, the former Black Rod, lodged his own complaint against Bercow, which was not upheld. But Leakey said he made the complaint, which he acknowledged had no third-party corroboration, because he was keen to encourage those who had experienced worse to come forward. But the report referred to him as a witness of a disagreement between Lisvane and Bercow on a security issue, including Bercow saying: “That’s typical of you clerks. The first sign of big trouble and you’ll head for cover and leave me to hold responsibility.” Leakey is described as recalling the interaction as “extraordinarily rude, unkind and quite brutal”. I’m sure you’ll find some slippery way of getting out of this. You clerks always do. Bercow has denied all of the allegations of bullying and alleged there has been a coordinated attempt to assassinate his character and that the investigations have failed to follow due process. The panel found that Bercow “does not accept the findings we have made and does not acknowledge the impact of his behaviour. In our view he has little or no insight into the way he behaved or its consequences. He has sought to minimise the outcome for these complainants.” In one extraordinary paragraph, the investigator reveals Bercow mimicked Lisvane “on at least 20 occasions” during the course of their conversation. The former Speaker said that misconduct claims against him had been upheld even when witnesses testified that they had not taken place. He said complainants had opposed his reforms for parliament to make the Commons more inclusive and diverse. Parliament is supposed to be the highest court in the land. This inquiry, which lasted a ghastly 22 months at great cost to the taxpayer, has failed it dismally. At the end of it, the panel has simply said that I should be denied a parliamentary pass which I have never applied for and do not want. That is the absurdity of its position. Bercow said he could still attend debates in parliament “with the help of a friendly passholder or go as a member of the public”. He said the evidence against him “would have been thrown out by any court in the land since it is based on the flimsiest of evidence, rooted in hearsay and baseless rumour, and advanced by old-school dogmatists once intent on resisting change at all costs and now settling some ancient scores with me”.",News/Politics,‘Rude and threatening’: the main findings of the John Bercow bullying inquiry,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/08/rude-and-threatening-the-main-findings-of-the-john-bercow-bullying-inquiry
3/9/2022,"Car manufacturers are facing soaring costs and supply issues after the price of nickel doubled to record levels in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Prices passed $100,000 (£76,000) a tonne – driven up by buyers racing to cover short positions – before the London Metal Exchange (LME) suspended trading in nickel for the day. Nickel is a crucial element in the production of electric vehicle batteries, as well as of stainless steel, and about 10% of the world’s nickel comes from Russia. While the export of metals has not yet been the target of western sanctions, uncertainty over future supply has also helped push up the cost of aluminium, needed in the bodywork of cars, and palladium, used in catalytic converters, to record levels. The LME, one of the major commodity exchanges worldwide, said it had taken the decision to stop nickel trading “on orderly market grounds” as panic ensued, and said the suspension could last several days. Nickel prices quadrupled in the past week as traders digested the impact of the crisis on metal supplies. The Moscow-headquartered Nornickel, which mines metals in northern Siberia, is the world’s largest supplier of refined nickel suitable for batteries, as well as of palladium. The commodity prices threaten to drive up the price of electric vehicles, with affordability already an issue for consumers, at a time when the running cost of EVs is also rising steeply due to energy bills inflating faster even than pump prices. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said the “immediate future was unclear” and it was working with the government and its members to understand and address the long-term impacts of the situation. The SMMT’s chief executive, Mike Hawes, said: “Russia and Ukraine produce some key raw materials for the European automotive supply chain, including aluminium, palladium and nickel, which is used in battery manufacturing. “Rising metal costs add further risk into global supply chains already impacted by inflationary pressures, component shortages and energy price rises. UK vehicle makers are highly adaptable, but commodity prices are often set on international markets and volatility is expected for some time.” Last week the Stellantis boss, Carlos Tavares, warned of “an escalation of cost that comes from raw materials and energy, that is going to put more pressure on the business model”. A VW spokesperson said it had hedging contracts in place that would give some protection against short-term surges in raw material prices. The price of nickel had already hit what were then record levels at the start of the year – albeit only 15% of the latest peak – as surging demand for electric cars left manufacturers vying for raw materials. A year ago, Tesla’s Elon Musk highlighted the potential scarcity of metals for electric car manufacturing, tweeting: “Nickel is our biggest concern for scaling lithium-ion cell production.” The crisis has escalated manufacturer’s issues after a year in which shortages of chips, or semiconductors, hit production. Disruption to the Ukrainian automotive industry, which employs about 60,000 people and is a key supplier of certain parts to German companies, could exacerbate the shortages, some analysts warned.",News/Business,Carmakers face higher costs and supply issues as price of nickel soars,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/08/carmakers-face-higher-costs-and-supply-issues-as-price-of-nickel-soars
3/9/2022,"My former teacher Barbara Hibbert, who has died aged 64, was head of history at Harrogate grammar school in Yorkshire. She was an inspiring teacher, and ambitious for her pupils, many of whom credit her with setting them on their careers. I am not sure that I would have become a political journalist without her encouragement.Born in Oldham to Elsie (nee Ward), a secretary, and Denys, an electrician, Barbara went on a scholarship to Hulme grammar school for girls, before studying history at Leeds University. She was in some respects on the traditionalist wing of the profession: she thought the job was to instil deep historical knowledge rather than just teach transferable skills, and she encouraged her pupils to read widely. She believed in rigour, and favoured essay-writing, debating and so on, an approach that would become orthodox towards the end of her career.Above all, she was a champion of teachers’ autonomy, and sought to shield her staff from the micromanagement and bureaucracy that piled up under governments of all colours. Returning to Leeds for a PhD, she examined how well sixth forms prepared pupils for studying history at university. Often, she concluded, not very well: not the fault of teachers so much as a curriculum that incentivised cramming for examinations over independent thought.Barbara was an energetic organiser of learning outside the classroom: her pupils enjoyed a cycle of visiting speakers, essay prizes, conferences and trips. She was a believer in state education (despite the name, the school had become a comprehensive in the 1970s), but could be frustrated by complacency and drift. As she saw it, independent schools got the best of everything because they asked, and it fell to her to do the asking. She was particularly passionate about university admissions. Her colleagues recall she was similarly ambitious for her staff, many of whom have gone on to be leaders in the profession.Barbara was a loyal Guardian reader. Her classroom walls carried the cartoons of Steve Bell and pieces cut from the comment pages. She would come to despair of Brexit, and the state of the Labour party.After leaving Harrogate grammar in 2010, Barbara was a consultant to the charity Teach First, mentoring and supporting graduates to create a new generation of outstanding history teachers; and to Cambridge Assessment, the exam board. She was made an honorary fellow of the Historical Association, a charity, in 2012. Barbara was diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer in 2014. She survived many years past the expected lifespan, continuing her consultancy throughout. Typically she became an expert in her own illness, participating in several academic research projects at Leeds University as an “expert patient”, alongside spending her commuted teacher’s pension in Michelin-starred restaurants. “I keep plodding on. Am officially an outlier now,” she emailed last October. She is survived by her husband, Ed Ruck-Keene, whom she met in Harrogate in 1980 and married in 1983, their daughters, Eve and Rosa, and granddaughter, Liberty.",News/Education,Barbara Hibbert obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/08/barbara-hibbert-obituary

Last month, Andrew agreed to settle the civil suit filed by Giuffre regarding allegations of sexual assault. The payment was not disclosed but was thought to be between $13m and $15m. The stipulation of dismissal filed on Tuesday said that both parties “hereby stipulate to the dismissal of this action, with prejudice”, adding that each party would “bear her/his own costs and fees”. Giuffre alleges she met Andrew through the late sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein, and his sometime girlfriend, the convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. Giuffre alleged the prince sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17. Andrew has repeatedly and strenuously denied the allegations. The settlement announced in February made no admission of guilt. The settlement also stated that Andrew had “never intended to malign Ms Giuffre’s character” and said he recognized she had “suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks”. The settlement also said Andrew would make a “substantial donation” to Giuffre’s charity in support of sexual assault victims. In 2009, Epstein and Giuffre settled a civil lawsuit for $500,000. Giuffre accused Epstein of trafficking her to Andrew. In January, Andrew was completely removed from official royal life.

Between 1976 and 1985 Baron played the formidable Nurse Gladys Emmanuel in Roy Clarke’s popular sitcom Open All Hours, continually spurning the nuptial ambitions of the tightfisted shopkeeper Arkwright (Ronnie Barker), with whom she enjoyed a comically fractious relationship. Arkwright’s lust for Gladys was, Baron felt, a healthy repudiation of the idea that men idolise only slim women. “There are millions of big ladies out there married to men who think they’re wonderful”, she said. Some years after Barker’s death, the show’s other star, David Jason, headlined a revival – Still Open All Hours (2013-16) – which facilitated a return for Baron’s skilful comedic creation. If Open All Hours ensured that she was a welcome fixture for the family audience, then Baron’s run as the cheery Auntie Mabel in the much loved and hugely successful BBC educational programme Come Outside (1993-97) meant that she became a firm favourite with children. Mabel, piloting a polka dotted light aeroplane (a Slingsby T67 Firefly) and accompanied by her dog Pippin, would discover how various everyday things worked for the benefit of the young audience. Born Lilian Ridgeway in Urmston, Manchester, to Cyril, an interior decorator, and his wife, Lilian (nee Hawthorn), she started studying ballet aged four and attended Flixton girls’ high school as well as the Royal Academy of Dance. At 15, she said, “I realised there was so little room at the top in ballet, and being determined to get to the top I took up singing.” As a result, she began performing in pantomime at the Liverpool Empire, learning comic timing by watching from the wings every night. She was soon singing and dancing at end of the pier shows, and by the time she was 17 she was in London performing at the Astor Club in Mayfair. She made her London stage debut in Dora Bryan’s Garrick theatre revue, Living for Pleasure, in 1958. Other revue work followed, including One Over the Eight (1961-62, Shakespeare Memorial theatre, transferring to the Duke of York’s) alongside Kenneth Williams (the writers included Harold Pinter, John Mortimer and Peter Cook) and by 1965 she was the regular chanteuse at the Talk of the Town, becoming its longest-running leading lady. For television, in 1965 Ned Sherrin wrote the opening and closing numbers of the satirical sketch and revue programme BBC 3 (aired on BBC One) with her in mind, but despite the presence of Leonard Rossiter and Bill Oddie the show was not as successful as Sherrin’s earlier triumphs. Comedy was a common feature of Baron’s subsequent television career, opposite Bill Maynard in Oh No It’s Selwyn Froggitt (1977), with Harry H Corbett in Grundy (1980) and episodes of The Upper Hand (1992-93), and in Dinnerladies (1998), Goodnight Sweetheart (1999) and Citizen Khan (2016). In addition, she was good value as herself, guesting on many shows, including Blankety Blank (1983-87) and Countdown (2008). She also appeared in TV dramas: from the thriller Breaking Point (1966) to Doctors (nine episodes, 2000-14), via guest spots in everything from Z-Cars (1971) to Father Brown (2017). She was part of the ensemble cast of Fat Friends (2002-05) and her intermittent association with EastEnders – playing Jane Beale’s mother, Linda Clarke – lasted from 2006 to 2016. For Doctor Who she belted out the ballad that narrated the action in the 1966 serial The Gunfighters, a Western pastiche, with William Hartnell, and then had a ball as the sadistic, immortal space pirate, Captain Wrack, in Enlightenment (with Peter Davison, 1983). She returned as the cheery shop worker Val, befriending Matt Smith as he battled Cybermen in Closing Time in 2011. For her tour de force turn as Violet Carson in the BBC Four play The Road to Coronation Street in 2010, she was nominated for a best supporting actress Bafta. Her film work included the Hammer horror Hands of the Ripper (1971), Barbra Streisand’s Yentl (1983), Carry On Columbus (1992), Woody Allen’s Scoop (2006), and Dream Horse (with Damian Lewis, 2020). On stage she proved adept in musicals including Little Me (Prince of Wales, 1984-85), Stepping Out (Duke of York’s, 1985-86) and Follies (Shaftesbury theatre, 1987-89), in which she gave a showstopping rendition of Who’s That Woman as an ageing but still glamorous hoofer proving she’s still got it with light-footedness, expert tap, cussed verve and sassy elan. She also proved adept at farce in Ray Cooney’s Funny Money (Playhouse theatre, 1995) and Rookery Nook (Menier Chocolate Factory, 2009), and enjoyed starring opposite Zoë Wanamaker in Stevie (Chichester Festival theatre, transferring to the Hampstead, 2005) and Orlando Bloom in David Storey’s In Celebration at the Duke of York’s (2007). She was also a regular in pantomime, excelling as a raucously thigh-slapping principal boy. Her 1962 marriage to the hairdresser and music impresario Carol London (real name Cyril Smith) ended in divorce. In 1966 she married the jazz pianist and musical director John Lee; he died in 2001. Her two children, Sarah and Morgan, survive her.

3/9/2022,"Tens of thousands of women who asked the government to look into cripplingly expensive childcare costs in the UK had their demands for an inquiry rejected by the government on International Women’s Day. A petition calling for an independent review of childcare funding and affordability gathered 113,713 signatures, and triggered a debate on childcare in parliament. But at 3.36am on International Women’s Day those that had signed the petition were told the government had no plans to look into the cost and availability of childcare in an email from the petitions committee, which published the government’s response to its report on the ongoing impact of Covid-19 on new parents. In September last year a survey shared with the Guardian revealed that 96% of more than 20,000 working parents said ministers were not doing enough to support parents with the cost and availability of childcare while 97% said childcare in the UK was too expensive. The survey revealed low-income parents and those on universal credit were resorting to using food banks as a result of the high cost of childcare. The petitions committee stated that government response also “fails to commit” dedicated catch-up funding to deal with the backlog in parental mental health and health visiting services and “repeats the government’s commitment, originally given in its response to the committee’s first report on this issue, to strengthening redundancy protections for new and expectant mothers, but again fails to set a timetable for doing so”. The government said it had announced £500m in the 2021 autumn spending review for early years services, including mental health services for new parents. It added: “Tax-free childcare is a great offer for working parents.” In its response to the committee, the Department for Education said the need for a review had been debated twice and while the government “recognised the need for ongoing collaboration and discussion on the issue” it had been “collectively concluded that a formal review is not needed”. Joeli Brearley, the founder of Pregnant Then Screwed, said it was “quite astounding” that the news had been delivered on International Women’s Day. “Affordable childcare is a critical component of gender equality. Without it hundreds of thousands of mothers are forced out of their jobs, whilst 84% say that the cost of childcare has had a negative impact on their ability to progress their career,” she said. “We will never have gender equality whilst women cannot afford to go to work. Happy International Women’s Day to you too!” According to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the UK has the third most expensive childcare system in the world, behind only Slovakia and Switzerland; a full-time place costs £12,376 a year on average. Analysis released on Tuesday by Scottish Widows reveals that women retiring after 65 will save half as much money as men. Time out of the workplace and part-time work mean the average woman will need to work an extra 37 years to give her the same pension pot as a male counterpart.",Lifestyle/Money,UK government rejects request by thousands of women to examine childcare costs,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/08/uk-government-rejects-request-thousands-women-examine-childcare-costs
