3/8/2022,"A severe thunderstorm brought flash flooding to the Northern Beaches of Sydney, Australia, as heavy rainfall and flooding prompted multiple evacuation warnings in the city on March 8. The Bureau of Meteorology warned of life-threatening flash flooding and possible landslides as a severe thunderstorm approached Sydney’s northeast. The incoming storm prompted an evacuation warning for low-lying properties near the Manly Dam. Heavy rainfall drenched the state’s coastal areas the day before, with as much as 232 millimeters of rain recorded in parts of the state in the 24 hours before 9 am.

3/8/2022,"Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg flagged a ""creative"" solution to dissuading Russia's assault on Ukraine. He said US could deploy all of its ballistic missile submarines to see if Putin is ""really bluffing or not."" The US operates 14 ballistic missile submarines, each of which can carry 20 long range missiles. Retired US Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg on Monday suggested what he seemed to tout as a ""creative"" solution to Russia's invasion of Ukraine — activate the entire US fleet of ballistic missile submarines to see if Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""really bluffing or not"" on nuclear threats. ""You know, we've generally got between five and six ballistic missile submarines — the boomers — at sea at any one time,"" Kellogg said on the Fox News show ""Jesse Watters Primetime."" ""Flush the whole fleet, put every boomer we've got at sea, and we can crew them and put them out there. And you say: 'Look, we're not going to back off from a nuclear concern that you've got,'"" the general said. ""You know, go all in, bluff him — you know, he's — let's see if he's really bluffing or not,"" Kellogg continued. The US currently operates a total of 14 Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines (otherwise known as boomers), each of which can carry 20 long-range missiles, according to the US Navy. Kellogg, who served as national security adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence and as Chief of Staff for the National Security Council, said Putin's generals would likely be ""a little bit concerned."" ""You guys really want to do this, but you've got to become creative and you've got to put [Putin] on his back foot,"" said Kellogg. Watters had earlier asked Kellogg what he thought about ""distracting the Russians"" to make them ""a little nervous."" ""What if we had the Japanese stir up a little trouble on their eastern flank?"" Watters said. ""What if we sent some naval assets into the Black Sea? Just say: 'Hey, you know, we're protecting Turkey, our NATO ally.' What if, you know, we scrambled a few jets in the Baltics or something, something to make the Russians maybe think twice and take their eye off the ball a little bit?"" Kellogg didn't directly respond to Watters' ideas but offered his suggestion on submarines as an alternative solution. But the former national security adviser's comments on Putin seem to contradict what the general said just days earlier. On Saturday, Kellogg said that ""Putin does not bluff"" while speaking on the Fox News show ""Lawrence Jones Cross Country"" about the Russian leader's potential use of heavy artillery bombardment and cluster bombs on Ukraine. ""Putin does not bluff. When he said he was coming to Ukraine, he's going to go into Ukraine. And we should have been building up armaments back then. We didn't. We waited,"" he said. ""And part of the reason, we said, is because we believed if we did, it was going to be escalatory. Well, now we're too late."" Kellogg did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. On February 27, Putin placed Russia's nuclear deterrence forces on high alert, increasing the possibility of launch. He blamed sanctions from the West that had been enacted to punish the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine.

3/8/2022,"Joseph Ladapo says Florida will be the first state to recommend against COVID-19 vaccines for healthy kids. The surgeon general's announcement on Monday broke with the CDC's advice on COVID-19 jabs for kids. The CDC recommends that everyone aged five and up should get inoculated. Florida's Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo said on Monday that the state would be the first in the US to recommend that healthy children not receive the COVID-19 vaccination. ""The Florida Department of Health is going to be the first state to formally recommend against the COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children,"" Ladapo said. Ladapo announced the move at an event held by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis titled ""The Curtain Close on Covid Theater."" The name of the panel appeared to be a reference to a press event last week where DeSantis snapped at several high-schoolers standing behind him, criticizing them for wearing masks and participating in ""COVID theater."" Ladapo and other panelists at the event suggested that the vaccine gave children limited protection against COVID-19, contradicting advice from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""We're kind of scraping at the bottom of the barrel, particularly with healthy kids in terms of being actually able to quantify with any accuracy or any confidence the potential of benefit,"" Ladapo said of vaccines for kids. The CDC recommends that everyone aged five years and older get the COVID-19 vaccine, noting that vaccinations for children can help protect vulnerable family members and keep children from becoming seriously sick if they contract Covid. Ladapo did not elaborate on when his recommendation would be formally announced by the Florida state administration and did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider. ""You have this lack of trust in the medical establishment and in the CDC, and the politicization of those institutions, and that's not going to bode well for us as a society going forward,"" DeSantis said after Ladapo's announcement. DeSantis added that he saw an ""aversion to actual data if it conflicts with the narrative."" ""And then, really, a failure to weigh costs and benefits, whether that's lockdowns, whether that's school closures, or whether a healthy seven-year-old kid should get the COVID vaccine,"" he continued. In November, the CDC greenlit Pfizer's lower-dose vaccine for kids aged five to 11. Since then, 22 million children have received the vaccine, including 1.1 million children from Florida, per CNN. ""There are approximately 28 million children between the ages of 5 and 11 years old in the United States, and there have been nearly two million cases of COVID-19 within this age group during the pandemic,"" the CDC reported. ""COVID-19 can make children very sick and cause children to be hospitalized. In some situations, the complications from infection can lead to death."" Ladapo, a DeSantis nominee for surgeon general, dodged multiple questions on the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines at his confirmation hearing in January. He has also broken with the advice of public health experts on several occasions by promoting unproven treatments for COVID-19 like hydroxychloroquine, and asking people to stop relying on COVID-19 testing.

3/8/2022,"Passengers experienced an unsettling situation aboard an Alaska Airlines flight from Seattle to Orlando on Sunday evening. But the drama wasn’t caused over mask-wearing or a drunken brawler. The trouble on Flight 16 came from a precocious, tech-savvy boy, who likely got a good talking-to later. According to widespread media reports, shortly before the flight pulled into the terminal at Orlando International Airport, a message came over the intercom about a problem. “We’re taxiing in and all of a sudden the plane gets interrupted with a peculiar notice that we’re going to park on an active runway for a moment,” an unnamed passenger told WKMG. “After that, they said there was a threat to the plane and that we are not going to be approaching any terminal for anytime soon.” Police boarded and soon realized that a 10-year-old had airdropped an ominous message to another traveler, who notified a crew member. According to a statement from the Seattle-based carrier: “After Alaska Airlines flight 16 from Seattle landed in Orlando, it parked remotely because of a potential threat that was later deemed non-credible. Police boarded and cleared the aircraft. The plane continued to its gate and passengers deplaned as normal. We take safety seriously and we apologize for the inconvenience for our guests.” The mom and jokester were escorted off. No charges were filed.",U.S./Miami Herald,How a 10-year-old prankster caused a flight to Orlando to stop prematurely,https://news.yahoo.com/10-old-prankster-caused-flight-191655886.html
