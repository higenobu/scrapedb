Charitable giving during the holiday season this year takes on a new, happier meaning when it comes to tax deductions. Typically, most people aren't able to get a tax break when they donate money to a charity if they're claiming the standard deduction on their federal income tax returns. And nearly 9 out of 10 taxpayers are taking that standard deduction these days. Yet pandemic relief in Congress created a special but temporary break for giving money to a qualified charity that applies to people who do not itemize. A married couple taking the standard deduction is allowed to claim up to $600 for cash contributions made to qualifying charities in 2021, if filing a joint return. It's a temporary break, which is set to expire on Jan. 1. 2022 TAX GUIDE: Key dates for filing and extensions, claiming credits and planning for refunds DAILY MONEY NEWSLETTER: Get our latest personal finance stories delivered right in your inbox A single individual, including married individuals filing separate returns, can claim a deduction of up to $300 for cash contributions. If some of this sounds familiar, it is, somewhat. On 2020 federal income tax returns, cash donations of up to $300 made to qualifying organizations were treated as deductible for those who didn't itemize. ""The difference this year: Those who file married filing jointly are allowed a direct deduction of up to a combined total of $600,"" said Mark Steber, chief tax information officer at Jackson Hewitt, the national tax preparation chain. Such news can give you an extra incentive to stop shopping for some not-so-perfect gifts and instead opt to donate money to a charity that has a special meaning for a special someone on your gift list. That tax break might even make you more willing to tell some close friends that instead of gifts this year, you'd like them to give money directly to your favorite charity or cause. Tax savings can be $30 to $222 How much you'd save, of course, will depend on how much money you give, your taxable income and your tax bracket. ""With tax rates ranging from 10% to 37%, a $600 deduction would be worth $60 in reduced taxes to someone in the 10% tax bracket and $222 to someone in the 37% bracket,"" said Mark Luscombe, principal analyst for Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting. ""Similarly, a deduction of $300 would be worth $30 to someone in the 10% tax bracket and $111 to someone in the 37% tax bracket,"" he said. TAX REFUNDS: Use your tax refund or save it? Tax refunds are delayed but plan now to invest or splurge. TAX WRITE-OFFS: Self-employed tax deductions: You may qualify for tax write-offs for starting a business Remember, there are limits and restrictions for this deduction for those who don't itemize. You can deduct cash contributions made by check, credit card or debit card. But the IRS notes that ""cash contributions don’t include the value of volunteer services, securities, household items or other property."" So cleaning out the house and donating furniture isn't going to cut it for this unique tax break. ""It must be a cash donation – not goods or your time – and given to an organization approved by the IRS, not just a friend who is doing good work in the community,"" Steber said. And you want proof. A canceled check is sufficient to support a charitable donation, Luscombe said. If you hand over actual cash, you need a written letter from the charity to confirm the contribution. If you give $250 or more at once to a group, you need written communication to state whether the donor received something of value in return. TAX SEASON 2022: When are tax returns due? These are the deadlines to file REVIEWED TAX GUIDE: Reviewed's guide to tax season 2022: When to file, what tax software to use and more If you're itemizing, you can take a bigger deduction for charitable contributions, including donations of clothing, cars, securities and bigger ticket items. It's also good to know that pandemic-related relief in Washington temporarily eliminated some restrictions placed on how much money in cash contributions you can deduct, if you itemize, according to Lisa Greene-Lewis, a TurboTax CPA and tax expert. Usually, cash donations that you can deduct are limited to 60% of your adjusted gross income but that limit was temporarily eliminated for tax year 2021 returns, just like it was for 2020. As a result, ""taxpayers can claim a charitable deduction up to 100% of their adjusted gross income or AGI in 2021,"" said Susan Allen, senior manager for Tax Practice & Ethics with the American Institute of CPAs. Just because you can donate a lot of cash, though, doesn't mean that's the best strategy when it comes to tax planning. Some are better off donating stock that's been held more than a year and has built up a good deal of value directly to a charity to avoid capital gains taxes. Best to talk to your tax professional. (You can claim a charitable deduction for noncash assets held more than one year that's up to 30% of AGI. But the IRS permits a carryover for five tax years if your charitable deduction exceeds AGI limits in a given tax year.) ""Donating appreciated stock can be particularly advantageous since you can get a deduction for the fair market value of the donated stock without having to realize the gain on the stock as a taxable capital gain,"" Luscombe said. TAX DELAYS: IRS says stimulus check mistakes are among reasons for tax refund delays MY REFUND STATUS: When are taxes due in 2022 and where is my tax refund? What you need to know about tax season. Now is a great time to consider what donations you'd like to make. But again, you need to take into account whether you're going to itemize or not. ""If you donate noncash items, you need to be eligible to claim itemized deductions,"" Greene-Lewis said. Your itemized deductions, she noted, for expenses for things like home mortgage interest, property taxes and charitable contributions need to add up to more than your standard deduction, which is $12,550 single or married filing separately; and $25,100 for married filing jointly in 2021. For heads of households, the standard deduction is $18,800. Many people do not itemize deductions, especially after the tax rule changes went into place in 2018 and nearly doubled the standard deduction. Higher inflation also will drive up the standard deduction by several hundred dollars for the 2022 tax returns, which will be filed in 2023. The standard deduction for married couples filing jointly goes up by $800 for 2022. For single taxpayers and married individuals filing separately, the standard deduction increases by $400 for 2022. For heads of households, the standard deduction goes up another $600 for 2022. If you're making a last-minute donation, you want to be certain that the charity you’re considering is a qualified charity so that you can receive a tax break. ""Taxpayers often try to claim deductions for contributions to organizations that are not qualified charities, such as political candidates or lobbying organizations,"" Luscombe said. Giving to someone's personal GoFundMe effort isn't usually going to cut it. Yet donations made to GoFundMe certified charity fundraisers are tax-deductible and will receive tax receipts automatically from the charity partner, PayPal Giving Fund, according to a spokesperson for GoFundMe. The giving platform has specific GoFundMe Cause programs, including Justice & Equality, Pride, Mental Health and Basic Necessities. Keep your paperwork to back up your deduction and do your homework upfront. “Every year there are court cases where the IRS has denied an individual’s charitable contributions due to lack of required documentation, improper valuation, or lack of an appraisal, if needed,"" Allen said. Be cautious about just handing over money to any request during this giving season. ""There are, unfortunately, a lot of scammers who are looking for 'donations' this time of year,"" Steber warned. The IRS offers an online search tool for finding out about an organization's tax-exempt status at IRS.gov. Paying attention now – and making any last-minute cash donations by Dec. 31 – can make a good deal of sense because many people who don't itemize are looking at a tax benefit with a limited shelf life.

4/12/2022,"(Reuters) - Shares of Warner Bros Discovery Inc rose on Monday, the first trading day of the media and streaming firm formed from the $43-billion merger of Discovery Inc and assets of AT&T Inc. Warner Bros Discovery shares were up 0.8% at $24.62, while AT&T stock climbed 2% to $18.62 before the bell. AT&T and Discovery set out to create a standalone media business in May last year and the deal closed on Friday, with the new business housing channels including HBO, CNN and the Discovery Channel as well as franchises like ""Batman"" and ""Harry Potter"". The company, which also owns streaming services HBO Max and Discovery+, faces stiff competition from the likes of Netflix and Walt Disney Co's Disney+. Warner Bros Discovery is led by long-time Discovery veteran David Zaslav, and the new leadership team, announced last week, comprises many of his lieutenants. ""We expect that Zaslav will use his experience to help Warner Bros. Discovery transition into a DTC (direct-to-consumer) powerhouse by focusing further investment in both content and the user experience, which has garnered complaints on both HBO Max and Discovery+,"" Morningstar analyst Neil Macker wrote in a note. Analysts at MoffettNathanson also signaled rising interest rates as a concern for the stock, adding there are concerns about slowing DTC subscriber growth across the industry. Meanwhile, AT&T can focus on its core business as the telecom major uses part of the proceeds to cut down debt. J.P. Morgan said it was an attractive time to buy into AT&T. ""We see the stock as defensive and inexpensive with a high dividend yield of 6.0% and FCF (free cash flow) yield of 14.2% as long as the company can continue to deliver on its guidance and financial targets,"" the brokerage said.

4/12/2022,"Newly-formed streaming giant Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) officially began trading on the Nasdaq (^IXIC) on Monday, opening at $24.08 a share in its first day as a publicly-traded entity. Ahead of the company's Wall Street debut, Evercore ISI Group upgraded the stock from In-line to Outperform, announcing a $40 price target. The $43 billion merger, which closed on Friday, solidifies Discovery CEO David Zaslav's position as the company's new chief. WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar departed upon the deal's closing. ""I am confident that our collective energy and genuine love for these businesses and brands will build the world's most dynamic media and entertainment company,"" Zaslav wrote in an employee memo, cited by CNN. Zaslav went on to say that Warner Bros. Discovery is ""well positioned to become a top-tier streaming competitor,"" as the company looks to compete with established players in the space from Netflix (NFLX) and Disney+ (DIS) to Apple TV+ (AAPL) and Amazon Prime Video (AMZN). AT&T (T) shares began Monday's session in the green (up roughly 4%). Shareholders of AT&T hold 71% of the new company. Discovery shareholders hold the remaining 29%. ""This is going to be the most exciting story in the sector for the next few years,"" Jessica Reif, research analyst at Bank of America, previously told Yahoo Finance. ""If you step back, this is probably going to be the broadest offering the market has yet to see,"" Reif stated, emphasizing the immense advertising potential that could result, in addition to the company's ability to optimize content spend, increase marketing efficiency and reduce churn. The analyst referenced the elevated scripted content of WarnerMedia's HBO — from cultural success ""Game of Thrones"" to the more recent phenomenon ""Mare of Easttown"" — along with Discovery's quirky, cult-favorite programs, such as ""Dr. Pimple Popper"" and ""90 Day Fiancé."" WarnerMedia also has lucrative development deals with high-profile creatives, including ""The Batman"" director Matt Reeves, ""The Sex Lives of College Girls"" creator Mindy Kaling, ""Insecure's"" Issa Rae, and many more. ""[HBO Max] is at the very beginning of its growth curve,"" Reif continued, noting the streaming service has been ""on fire,"" despite increased competition in the space. As of the end of 2021, HBO and HBO Max have a combined subscriber count of 73.8 million. Comparatively, Discovery last reported 22 million subs. As investors begin to shift focus away from subscriber growth, Reif predicted that business operations and profitability will be key variables for shareholders moving forward. ""'Is this a real business?' 'Can you make money?' Can you offset the declines in the legacy business?'"" the analyst said, reiterating her belief that Warner Bros. Discovery has ""the best set of assets"" to not only help offset declines in the secular business but also expand ""into the next growth curves of streaming."" Still, execution remains a top challenge amid new management and restructuring woes. In addition to Kilar, the company laid off other key executives, including Warner Bros. chief Ann Sarnoff and HBO Max head Andy Forssell. Profitability will also be in focus as investors zoom in on earnings potential and the business impact on EBITDA and free cash flow. Geetha Ranganathan, senior media analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told Yahoo Finance that, ""Investors are still worried about how the profit numbers are going to shake out and whether [Warner Bros. Discovery] will be able to deliver on their free cash flow target,"" which is roughly $8 billion by 2023. HBO Max alone is likely to generate about $1.5 billion in EBITA loss, the analyst said. ""At the end of the day, the HBO Max / Discovery product is going to be in the top four streamers, along with Disney, Netflix, and Amazon Prime,"" Ranganathan predicted, although she cited ""some short term pain"" when it comes to the profitability of free cash flow.

4/12/2022,"(Reuters) -The rouble weakened sharply on Monday, reversing some of the previous week's gains, after Russia relaxed temporary capital control measures aimed at limiting a drop in the currency. Shares in Rosbank, a Russian subsidiary of French bank Societe Generale, jumped 40% after SocGen said it would quit Russia and take a 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) income hit from selling Rosbank to Interros Capital, a firm linked to Russian oligarch Vladimir Potanin. By 1500 GMT, the rouble had lost more than 4% of its value in jittery trade, sliding to 79.45 to the dollar, and was down 4.5% to 86.45 against the euro. During the trading session on Moscow Exchange, the rouble fell to 82.0950 against the dollar, from the 71 roubles hit on Friday which was its strongest since Nov. 11. Late on Friday the central bank said it would scrap a 12% commission for buying foreign currency through brokerages from April 11 and lift a temporary ban on selling foreign exchange cash to individuals from April 18. ""The central bank gave markets a unequivocal signal that a further rouble strengthening was undesirable,"" said Vladimir Evstifeev, an analyst at Zenit Bank. The decision to scrap the 12% commission on FX operations means speculators will be able to trade again, Alor Brokerage said, adding market players were tending to lock in even small profits. The rouble retains support from the obligatory conversion of 80% of FX revenues by export-focused companies as well as from high interest rates, even though the central bank unexpectedly cut its key rate from 20% to 17% last week. ITI Capital analysts said Russia receives about $1.4 billion a day in export revenues and the rouble could firm further, given Russian capital controls and shrinking imports. The central bank's cut supported Russian OFZ government bonds. The finance ministry said at the weekend that it wouldn't borrow on local or foreign debt markets this year. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov also said Russia would take legal action if the West tried to force it to default on its sovereign debt. Yields on 10-year OFZs, which move inversely with their prices, fell to 10.45% on Monday. That was their lowest since Feb. 21, three days before Russia started what it calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine, triggering unprecedented Western sanctions against Russia. On the stock market, the dollar-denominated RTS index fell 5.8% to 1,017.4 points and the rouble-based MOEX Russian index shed 1% to 2,566.6 points, with losses limited by the rouble's slide.

4/12/2022,"Setting aside money regularly is one of the surest ways to save for retirement–especially when you take advantage of tax savings over time. Though some retirement accounts are tax-deferred, one popular option that isn't tax-deferred is a Roth IRA. However, in order to make the most of an Roth IRA, you need to know how it works and what the maximum contribution limits are. One straightforward strategy in particular can help you maximize your savings. A financial advisor could help you evaluate your retirement plan's performance and help you select investments that align with your financial goals. Find a qualified advisor today. How Does a Roth IRA Work? A Roth IRA is an individual retirement account that allows you to withdraw money on a tax-free basis upon retirement. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars. In a traditional IRA, you fund the account with pre-tax money and pay income taxes when it comes time to withdraw. In the case of a Roth IRA, you fund the account with post-tax money and pay no taxes at retirement on either the principal or interest so long as you've held the account for at least five years. Roth IRAs are generally considered more flexible than traditional IRAs. For example, some early withdrawals may be allowed on a tax-free basis if you've met both the five-year-rule and specific conditions required for a qualified distribution. Otherwise, your withdrawal may be subject to taxes and penalty fees. You also are not required to withdraw from your Roth IRA for as long as you live if you don't want to, which makes Roth IRAs rather valuable estate-planning tools. What Are the Roth IRA Contribution Limits? The IRS limits Roth-IRA contributions by income level, so if you're married and file jointly, your combined income cannot exceed $214,000 if you want to contribute to one. You can contribute up to the maximum limit if you earn less than $204,000, but as your income increases, the amount you can contribute is phased out. For 2022, the maximum total contributions you can make to all your IRAs, either traditional or Roth, cannot exceed $6,000 a year. If you're aged 50 or older, the IRS allows you an additional catch-up contribution of $1,000, bringing your total to $7,000 for the year. Although this may not sound like much, if you assume a 7% rate of return, $6,000 invested annually can build up to $612,438 over 30 years. You'll have contributed a total of $180,000 and earned $426,438 in interest. How Much Should You Put in a Roth IRA per Month? Since Roth IRA contributions are limited by income, many individuals often wait until they do their taxes to contribute. While any money saved for retirement is positive, financial experts actually don't recommend this method for maximizing your savings. A better method is to follow a dollar-cost-averaging approach. If you contribute only once a year to your Roth IRA, you may be investing your money during a high or low moment in the market, which could potentially keep you from earning the maximum amount over time. With dollar-cost averaging, you don't time the market. Instead, you invest a set amount of money evenly throughout the year on a regular basis. This allows you to earn interest over the entire year and smooths out the ups and downs, giving you more bang for your buck. Because the maximum annual contribution amount for a Roth IRA is $6,000, following a dollar-cost-averaging approach means you would therefore contribute $500 a month to your IRA. If you're 50 or older, your $7,000 limit translates to $583 a month. If you invest $6,000 once a year at an average 7% rate of return, you could have $612,438 in your IRA after 30 years. On the other hand, if you invest $500 a month, you could end up with $658,684. That's an estimated increase of nearly $40,000 just from contributing monthly instead of annually. Bottom Line In 2022, the maximum amount you can contribute to a Roth IRA is $6,000. Since you derive the most benefit from tax-free growth by allowing your funds to earn interest over time, contributing $500 monthly to your Roth IRA instead of once a year means you can earn an estimated $40,000 extra over your lifetime. Saving for retirement can be complicated, however, and deciding which retirement plans and accounts work best depends on your situation. It may help to speak with an advisor who can help you determine how much you'll need as well as how to distribute your savings for your specific circumstances. Always make sure you research and understand the benefits from each type of retirement account in order to maximize your savings.

4/12/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Bond markets and the S&P 500 are too sanguine about the economic outlook, according to Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist. Most Read from Bloomberg Ukraine Update: Austria Chancellor to Meet Putin; New War Front Covid Could Be Surging in the U.S. Right Now and We Might Not Even Know It Musk Rejects Twitter’s Offer to Join Board in Surprise Twist Singapore’s Lee Warns U.S. Against Isolating China Over Ukraine Nasdaq 100 Slumps 2% as Treasury Yields Climb: Markets Wrap “We have another example of extreme divergence between the internals of the stock market which are strongly indicating a growth scare, while bonds and the S&P 500 are suggesting growth is not only ok, but likely to remain robust in the case of bonds,” Michael Wilson and his team wrote in a note to clients on Monday. This deviation will prove unsustainable, and cyclical stocks are the most vulnerable when it’s eventually resolved, they said. U.S. stocks started the year on the wrong footing amid concerns that the Federal Reserve will have to tighten its policy more aggressively than previously anticipated as it seeks to regain control over runaway inflation. Wilson, who has been one of Wall Street’s most vocal bears, argues that this drawdown has yet to price a looming sharp slowdown of the economy. “The internals of the equity market are telling a much different story than bonds or the headline S&P 500 index which continues to trade at valuations we find hard to justify,” according to the Morgan Stanley strategists. Defensive stocks, and in particular the utilities sector, are having one of their best absolute and relative periods of performance on record, Wilson said. Central banks typically pause and reverse interest-rate hikes when the economy slows or goes into recession. While the outperformance of defensive stocks points to such a disappointment on the growth front, this is not currently reflected in bond markets or the broader equity market, Wilson said. “We listen intently to what the internals of the stock market are saying because we believe it is the best strategist in the world,” he said. “Stay defensively oriented because growth is going to disappoint.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek The 15-Minute Ultrafast Delivery Craze Slams Into Reality Half a Million Men Are Still Missing From the U.S. Workforce China’s $2.3 Trillion Infrastructure Plan Puts America’s to Shame The Bridgewater CEO Who Went Full MAGA How Greenwood Became the Most Hyped Startup in Black America ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•7 hours ago,Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says the Bond Market and S&P 500 Are Too Sanguine,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-wilson-says-bond-085359966.html
4/12/2022,"By Indradip Ghosh and Prerana Bhat BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is expected to deliver two back-to-back half-point interest rate hikes in May and June to tackle runaway inflation, according to economists polled by Reuters who also say the probability of a recession next year is 40%. With the unemployment rate near a record low, inflation the highest in four decades and a surge in global commodity prices set to persist, most analysts say the Fed needs to move quickly to keep price pressures under control. The latest April 4-8 Reuters poll of more than 100 economists forecast two half-point rate rises this year, the first such move since 1994, taking the federal funds rate to 1.25%-1.50% by the June meeting. That brings the end-year prediction from the March Reuters poll at least three months forward, and more in line with interest rate futures pricing. A strong majority, or 85 of 102 economists, forecast 50 basis points in May, and a still-solid majority of 56 said the Fed would follow up with 50 basis points as well in June. ""Given the shift in official commentary and with inflation pressures visible throughout the economy, we believe the Fed will deliver half-point interest rate increases at the May, June and July policy meetings,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING. While the central bank, chaired by Jerome Powell, is likely to gear down to quarter-point moves in the second half of this year, the federal funds rate is now expected to end 2022 at 2.00%-2.25%, 50 basis points higher than the median forecast in a poll taken last month. Moving so quickly with interest rates, especially in an economy that has become used to very low borrowing costs for many years, comes with risks. ""With the Fed seemingly feeling the need to 'catch up' to regain control of inflation and inflation expectations, a rapid-fire pace of aggressive interest-rate increases heightens the chances of a policy misstep that could be enough to topple the economy into a recession,"" added Knightley. RAPID SLOWING Indeed, respondents to an additional question gave a median one-in-four chance of a U.S. recession in the coming year, rising to 40% over the next 24 months. The bond market is already showing signs of recession concerns. [US/INT] That partly explains a rapid slowing in the pace of rate hikes next year to only a cumulative 50 basis points, according to the Reuters poll, bringing the fed funds rate to 2.50%-2.75% by the end of 2023. A few economists are already predicting lower rates as soon as the fourth quarter of next year. Yet despite expectations for an aggressive policy tightening path, inflation was not seen dropping to the Fed's 2% target at least until 2024. The Russia-Ukraine war, which has sent commodity and energy prices soaring, is also making it harder to predict when inflation will eventually come down. Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was predicted to have peaked at 7.9% last quarter, and average 6.8% this year, a significant upgrade from 6.1% in last month's poll. The U.S. labor market was expected to further tighten after unemployment dropped to 3.6% last month, only slightly above pre-pandemic levels and what it is forecast to average in 2022. The jobless rate was predicted to average 3.5% next year and stay there in 2024, roughly in line with the Fed's own optimistic view and not consistent with respondents' concerns about recession. Growth forecasts were downgraded across the board. The economy was expected to grow 3.3% and 2.2% this year and next respectively, down from 3.6% and 2.4% predicted last month.

4/12/2022,"By Timothy Gardner, Julia Payne and Ahmad Ghaddar (Reuters) - The Biden administration is selling a record amount of emergency oil from national reserves to tame soaring U.S. fuel prices as quickly as possible, but the plan could backfire down the road if the stockpile is not replenished quickly. President Joe Biden on March 31 announced the United States would sell 180 million barrels of crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a rate of 1 million barrels per day starting in May, the biggest release from the stockpile since it was created in the 1970s. Country members of the International Energy Agency (IEA) are releasing an additional 60 million barrels to tame global prices. The decision to sell oil from the SPR, instead of working out a loan, also known as an exchange, marked a tradeoff: oil would be released to the market more quickly to lower prices, but it could take longer to replenish the stockpile to its current level, raising longer-term market risks. Some analysts warned it could make oil prices more volatile. Loans of U.S. oil from the SPR guarantee a return of oil over a set period but can take up to months to finalize as the government lines up buyers and negotiates contracts. ""When we want to rapidly expand global supply, especially by the historic amount we announced, it is much more efficient to do a sale than to seek to arrange company-by-company contracts (as required by a swap or exchange)"" a Biden administration official told Reuters. The sale comes with a vague timeline to repurchase barrels. The emergency stockpile is already at the lowest level since 2002, and if oil prices rise over time, it could be left at even lower levels. If it must be replenished when prices are high, taxpayers will have to pay the premium to refill it. The administration acted after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions and boycotts that followed launched retail gasoline prices to record highs, a vulnerability for Biden's fellow Democrats in November's congressional elections. Russia produces about 10% of global oil supply and Western sanctions are expected to cost the global market around 3 million barrels per day, according to the IEA. A White House fact sheet issued at the time of the release said only that the federal government would buy back oil, returning it to the SPR in ""future years."" THINKING LIKE A TRADER ""I think it's extremely cowboy-ish ... by doing an outright sale, purely thinking like a trader, if I did that I would get fired. Nobody knows which way the oil price will go,"" said Ilia Bouchouev, partner at Pentathlon Investments and adjunct professor at New York University. ""Doing this will only increase volatility because it reduces the buffer,"" he added. The SPR now holds 564.6 million barrels, about a month's worth of U.S. oil and liquid fuels demand. The level after the 180 million barrel sale would still be far above IEA requirements that it cover 90 days of U.S. crude imports, currently about 3 million bpd. Oil companies are also due to begin returning some 32 million barrels in coming months from a loan enacted by Washington last November. David Goldwyn, a former special envoy and coordinator for international energy affairs at the U.S. State Department, defended the administration’s choice of a sale. He said the scale and duration of the release made hashing out loan contracts with energy companies too complicated. ""They provided themselves a maximum amount of flexibility."" Benjamin Salisbury, an energy policy analyst at Height Capital Markets, said selling a record amount from the SPR could boost market volatility longer-term. ""It is a real risk that removing oil from storage, including the SPR, reduces the buffer to respond to future disruptions, thus expanding the geopolitical risk premium,"" he said. U.S. gasoline prices spiked after global benchmark Brent oil touched a 14-year high on March 7 of over $138 a barrel on worries about Western sanctions on Moscow. Brent has fallen after the releases, hovering around $101 a barrel on Friday. [O/R] Despite the high prices, some U.S. shale producers have been reluctant to boost output and the OPEC+ production group, which includes Russia, has only hiked supply gradually as consumers emerge from the global COVID-19 pandemic. Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs said the SPR release risks crowding out U.S. shale drillers' expected production growth of about 1.1 million bpd this year by adding to logistical constraints in the U.S. Gulf Coast. But Salisbury said a loan was not a great option because it may have required the return of huge quantities of oil to the stockpile before global supplies had time to ease. ""With the growing risk of a protracted Russian conflict and lingering sanctions, it is not clear that it would be advantageous to set a date certain for removing oil from the market to repay a loan in 6 or even 18 months,"" Salisbury said.

4/12/2022,"(Reuters) -Russia will take legal action if the West tries to force it to default on its sovereign debt, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told the pro-Kremlin Izvestia newspaper on Monday, sharpening Moscow's tone in its financial wrestle with the West. Russia faces its first external sovereign default in more than a century after it made arrangements to make an international bond repayment in roubles last week, even though the payment was due in U.S. dollars. It had been due on April 4 to make a payment of $649 million to holders of two of its sovereign bonds, but the U.S. Treasury blocked the transfer, preventing Russia from using any of its frozen foreign currency reserves to service its debt. ""Of course we will sue, because we have taken all the necessary steps to ensure that investors receive their payments,"" Siluanov told the newspaper in an interview. ""We will present in court our bills confirming our efforts to pay both in foreign currency and in roubles. It will not be an easy process. We will have to very actively prove our case, despite all the difficulties."" Siluanov did not elaborate on Russia's legal options and did not say where any court hearing could happen. The bonds in question were issued under English law, which allows a borrower to defend itself by saying that an external force made it impossible to honour obligations, so the court may postpone the payment, said Mitu Gulati, professor of law at the University of Virginia. ""So I think Russia is going to argue this but ... this is a war ... caused by Russia,"" said Gulati, also an expert on debt restructuring, adding: ""This is not a completely implausible legal argument."" DELIBERATE POLICY Siluanov has said Russia will do everything possible to make sure its creditors are paid. ""Russia tried in good faith to pay off external creditors,"" Siluanov was quoted saying. ""Nevertheless, the deliberate policy of Western countries is to artificially create a man-made default by all means."" Siluanov said Russia's external liabilities amount to about 20% of the total public debt, which stood at about 21 trillion roubles ($262 billion). Of that, about 4.5-4.7 trillion roubles were external liabilities. The finance ministry did not reply to a Reuters for a comment on what specific legal actions Russia may take. Russia has not defaulted on its external debt since the aftermath of its 1917 revolution, but its bonds have now emerged as a flashpoint in its economic tussle with Western countries. The key question is whether Russian assets previously frozen by Western countries, such as nearly a half of Russia's $640 billion in gold and foreign exchange reserves, could be claimed by creditors following the default, said Artur Starikov, a partner with Capital Law Office. A default was unimaginable until recently, with Russia rated as investment grade in the run-up to its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"". ""If an economic and financial war is waged against our country, we are forced to react, while still fulfilling all our obligations,"" Siluanov said. ""If we are not allowed to do it in foreign currency, we do it in roubles.""

4/12/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s crude oil exports, a key source of revenue for Vladimir Putin’s regime, are showing no signs that they are starting to crumble amid the disappearance of European buyers. Most Read from Bloomberg Ukraine Update: Austria Chancellor to Meet Putin; New War Front Covid Could Be Surging in the U.S. Right Now and We Might Not Even Know It Musk Rejects Twitter’s Offer to Join Board in Surprise Twist Singapore’s Lee Warns U.S. Against Isolating China Over Ukraine Nasdaq 100 Slumps 2% as Treasury Yields Climb: Markets Wrap Shipments in the seven days to April 8 continued a rebound that began the previous week, after consistently falling since Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. That’s according to Bloomberg News’s first tracker of all crude leaving the country’s export terminals on ocean-going tankers. Weekly shipments hit almost 4 million barrels a day in the first full week of April, the highest level seen so far this year. That was up by almost one quarter over the previous week. And the same pattern holds for the export duty revenues that the Russian state receives on overseas shipments. In the week to April 8, they jumped back to equal their highest level this year, after falling in each of the two previous weeks. Boosted by a combination of higher export volumes and an increase in the duty payable per barrel in April, the Kremlin earned an estimated $230 million from seaborne crude exports in the week to April 8, based on calculations of the amount payable on each cargo that left Russian ports that week. But while overall export volumes are shrugging off import bans and self-sanctioning, there is one area where a clear impact is already being seen -- the distances that cargoes are being shipped to find willing buyers. European oil majors including Shell Plc and TotalEnergies SE, which normally run tanker loads of Russian crudes through their refineries every week, have said they will stop buying out of revulsion over the war in Ukraine. The U.S. has stopped buying all Russian oil and the U.K. will follow suit by the end of the year. The early data suggest it’s having an impact. At the same time, there are signs traders are starting to work on ways to get more crude to Asia, where buyers are willing to take advantage of big discounts on Russian oil. Increasing numbers of Very Large Crude Carriers, supertankers able to carry two million barrels, are loading Russian crude from smaller ships in the Mediterranean Sea and elsewhere. Before the war, Russia was the world’s second-largest oil exporter, behind Saudi Arabia, shipping almost 5 million barrels of crude oil every day with a spot-market value of more than $500 million. Some of that crude is delivered by pipeline directly to refineries in Europe and China, but about 60% moves by sea. In the coming months, we plan to systematically track the flow of seaborne crude from Russia, providing week-by-week insight into how the war is affecting those flows, and showing the impact on Russia’s petro-reliant economy. Disappearing Markets Traditional markets in Northwest Europe for Russia’s Baltic Sea exports are disappearing fast, as buyers self-sanction Moscow’s crude. Half of the ships loading at the northwest Russian ports of Primorsk and Ust-Luga last week are either heading to Asia, or not showing final destinations. Most of that second group are signaling destinations such as Gibraltar or Malta, suggesting that they may either be heading to Asia via the Suez Canal or to conduct ship-to-ship transfers in the Mediterranean (see below). The Mediterranean is starting to become a preferred location for transfers of cargoes of Russian crude from smaller vessels onto giant intercontinental supertankers for shipment to Asia. Exports from the Black Sea terminal at Novorossiysk soared in the past week, surging to just under 800,000 barrels a day, more than three times the volume shipped in the previous week, when a backlog of vessels waiting to load built up off the port. Most shipments from Novorossiysk are staying within the Mediterranean region, which includes the Black Sea ports of Bulgaria and Romania, where three of the seven cargoes have discharged. Of 21 Urals cargoes loaded from Primorsk, Ust-Luga and Novorossiysk in the week to April 8, six are heading to India, four have unknown destinations and the remainder look set to deliver their cargoes within Europe, according to their destination signals. Shipments from the Arctic port of Murmansk are still finding outlets in northwest Europe, with all three cargoes that loaded in the week to April 8 heading either to Rotterdam in the Netherlands or Wilhelmshaven in Germany, according to their destination signals. Shipments from Russia’s three Pacific Ocean terminals, dominated by exports of ESPO crude from Kzmino, are almost all now heading to China, with only occasional cargoes going elsewhere. Perhaps the biggest initial impact of the import bans and self-sanctioning of Russian crude is to be seen in the very long and unusual journeys that some cargoes are beginning to make. Cargoes are being transferred from the ships that call at Russian terminals onto much bigger vessels in order to benefit from economies of scale on the long voyages to China and India. A supertanker, known in industry speak as a Very Large Crude Carrier, or VLCC, can be used to accumulate the cargoes from three smaller vessels, known as Aframaxes, that often load west Russian barrels. Vitol Group, the world’s biggest independent oil trader, booked a supertanker, Searacer, to load from Denmark’s Skaw, a popular location for ship-to-ship transfers of Russian cargoes. Instead, the ship has been off Morocco since mid-March, where it has taken three consignments of Urals crude, one loaded in the Black Sea and the other two in the Baltic, from smaller vessels. It is now heading back into the Atlantic, signaling its next port of call as Saldanha Bay in South Africa, though its fixture history suggests an eventual destination in China. The next VLCC to take on Russian crude off Ceuta is the Elandra Denali, which arrived there on April 4. It began its first cargo transfer on April 9 from the Aframax Tigani, which loaded its cargo at Primorsk in the Baltic in late Mrch. Likewise Unipec, the trading arm of Chinese oil giant Sinopec, part filled the VLCC Nissos Rhenia with cargoes from two Aframax tankers off Rotterdam. The vessel is now headed for Ningbo in China, where it is expected to arrive in mid-May. India-Bound Cheap Russian crude, which is selling at record discounts to international benchmarks, is finding willing buyers in India. For the first time in two years, an Aframax tanker is making the voyage from the Baltic to the Asian country. The Moskovsky Prospect is heading to Vadinar with a cargo of Urals crude loaded from Primorsk. An even longer voyage is being undertaken by the Suezmax tanker Matala, steaming from Murmansk in Russia’s Arctic coast to Paradip on the east coast of India. It’s a journey that’s expected to last for more than a month. It’s not all plain sailing for tankers carrying Russian crude. The Beijing Spirit criss-crossed the Atlantic Ocean with a cargo of Lukoil’s Varandey crude loaded at Murmansk and headed initially for Philadelphia. Halfway across the ocean it turned back, heading for the Mediterranean to eventually discharge at Lukoil’s own ISAB refinery on the Italian island of Sicily. Note: There will always be high degree of variation in weekly export numbers, due to bad weather and the natural lumpiness of shipments, which increase in jumps of at least 600,000 barrels — a standard minimum cargo size.

4/12/2022,"A flurry of big bank earnings and fresh inflation data out of Washington are expected to keep investors busy this holiday-shortened trading week. Market participants will also tune in Wednesday for a key economic report on March retail sales activity. Despite a four-day trading session, with Wall Street closed for Good Friday, a pivotal week is underway for investors as mega-banks including JPMorgan Chase, (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Citigroup (C) get the ball rolling on Q1 earnings season. On the economic data front, markets will get the latest gauge of U.S. inflation with Tuesday’s closely-watched Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI) set for publication Wednesday. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) March read on CPI is expected to come in red hot again, with inflation unlikely to show any signs of abating as supply chain snarls continue to flare up prices, particularly with Russia’s war in Ukraine weighs on flows of global energy and commodities. Consensus economists anticipate headline CPI will again accelerate to show an 8.4% year-over-year increase, surging higher from February’s 7.9% rise, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The figure would mark another decades-high rate of inflation, with the index, even excluding volatile food and energy prices, set to climb as much as 6.6%, up from February’s 6.4% increase. On a month-over-month basis, economists are looking for a 0.5% rise — a print that would mark 22 consecutive monthly advances on consumer prices across the U.S. “The upcoming Consumer Price Index for March will not be pretty,” Bankrate chief financial analyst Greg McBride said in a note. “Inflation has continued to accelerate in recent months and with the higher gasoline and food prices stemming from the war in Ukraine, the worst is likely still to come.” The newest CPI print is due out as markets grapple with the likelihood Federal Reserve officials will act more aggressively to rein in inflation after a hawkish readout of minutes last week from the central bank’s March meeting suggested ""many"" policymakers favored a double-bump interest rate hike to combat surging price levels. Conversations detailed in the March 15-16 Fed minutes indicated the bank will soon begin to unwind its $9 trillion balance sheet and signaled members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) “would have preferred a 50 basis point increase"" in benchmark interest rates last month when the Fed raised rates for the first time since 2018. The minutes also echo recent public remarks from Fed leaders, including commentary on Thursday from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard who said he wanted the central bank to get to between 3% and 3.25% on the Fed funds rate in the second half of this year, implying more aggressive, front-loaded interest rate hikes in the near-term. Fed Governor Lael Brainard also said last week that the FOMC was ""prepared to take stronger action,"" should inflation readings remain elevated and warrant such moves. “With prices increasing everywhere you look and both consumers and businesses bracing for more, it is time for the Federal Reserve to take the gloves off,” McBride said. ""The Fed is now much more inclined to boost interest rates by one-half percentage point at their meeting in May, and very possibly beyond.” Inflation numbers are underway this week not only on the consumer side but f​​rom the perspective of costs to producers supplying goods. The Producer Price Index (PPI) set for release Wednesday is expected to show another elevated figure, with Bloomberg economists expecting a reading of 10.6% year-over-year, up from the already higher-than-expected 10.0% in the prior month. Last month, economists at Bank of America said the headline number was “boosted by blistering strength in commodities” as energy and food prices jolted higher. “Underlying inflation pressures likely remain elevated given constrained supply chains and tightening labor markets,” BofA said in the note from last month. Meanwhile on Wednesday, investors will be watching for March retail sales numbers. Consensus economists are expecting retail sales excluding autos, released by the U.S. Census Bureau, increased slightly last month by 0.6%, compared to February’s advance of 0.3%, according to Bloomberg data. The number, however, remains low compared to a rise of 1.0% in January. Bank of America economists attributed a window in retail sales activity to slower auto purchases but expect rising gas prices will offset weakness in auto related spending. According to BofA data, gas spending surged by 6.5% month-over-month in March as retail gas prices reached historic highs. On the earnings front, investors will see a pick-up in releases of quarterly results with some of the largest U.S. banks commencing a new corporate reporting season. JPMorgan is the first set to unveil its Q1 numbers on Wednesday, with a lineup of other industry heavyweights following suit before the bell on Thursday: Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Citigroup (C). Banks stand to benefit from the backdrop of monetary tightening by the Fed, with higher interest rates poised to increase banks’ net interest income (the bank’s earnings on its lending activities and interest it pays to depositors) and net interest margins (calculated by dividing net interest income by the average income earned from interest-producing assets.) However, analysts are expecting a lackluster year for the industry’s earnings despite the profitability boost, specifically compared to the profit boom last year. In 2021, bank balance sheets benefited significantly from releasing COVID-era credit loss allowances, reserves financial institutions accumulated at the start of the pandemic to absorb the potential shock of borrowers being unable to pay their debts. This year, that financial boost will be absent from results. Bank profits were also lifted by exceptionally strong dealmaking and trading in 2021, but investment banking revenues stalled after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February. Still, strategists anticipate a solid earnings season overall. According to data from FactSet’s John Butters, analysts have slightly lowered bottom-up EPS estimates on S&P 500 companies in aggregate for the first quarter (a 0.7% decrease from $52.21 to $51.83), from year-end 2021 through March 31. However, they lifted EPS forecasts for the second quarter by 1.6% from $55.16% to $56.07, by 2.4% from $57.82 to $59.23 for the third quarter, and by 3.9% from $58.31 to $60.59 for the fourth quarter. Given the increases in estimates for the second, third, and fourth quarters, analysts also increased EPS estimates for all of 2022, lifting projections by 2.0% for the year from $223.43 to $227.80. “In this environment, with valuation expansion potentially tough to come by due to rising interest rates and high inflation, earnings take on more importance,” said LPL Financial equity strategist Jeff Buchbinder in a recent note. “The good news is corporate America is in excellent shape — earnings estimates are higher in 2022 now than they were at the start of the year, which is no small feat.” — Economic calendar Monday: No notable reports scheduled for release Tuesday: NFIB Small Business Optimism, March (95.0 expected, 95.7 during prior month), Consumer Price Index month-over-month, March (1.2% expected, 0.8% during prior month), CPI excluding food and energy month-over-month, March (0.5% expected, 0.5% during prior month), CPI year-over-year, March (8.4% expected, 7.9% during prior month), CPI excluding food and energy year-over-year, March (6.6% expected, 6.4% during prior month), CPI Index NSA, March (287.410 expected, 283.716 during prior month), CPI Core Index SA, March (289.188 expected, 287.878 during prior month), Real Average Hourly Earnings, year-over-year, March (-2.6% prior, revised to -2.5%), Real Average Weekly Earnings, year-over-year, March (-2.3% prior, revised to -2.2%), Monthly Budget Statement (-185.5 billion expected, -$216.6 billion prior) Wednesday: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended April 8 (-6.3% during prior week), PPI final demand, month-over-month, March (1.1% expected, 0.8% during prior month), PPI excluding food and energy, month-over-month, March (0.5% expected, 0.2% during prior month), PPI excluding food, energy, and trade, month-over-month, March (0.5% expected, 0.2% during prior month), PPI final demand, year-over-year, March (10.6% expected, 10.0% during prior month), PPI excluding food and energy, year-over-year, March (8.4% expected, 8.4% during prior month), PPI excluding food, energy, and trade, year-over-year, March (6.6% expected, 6.6% during prior month), Net Long-Term TIC Outflows, January ($114.5 billion during prior month), Thursday: Retail Sales Advance, month-over-month, March (0.6% expected, 0.3% during prior month), Retail Sales excluding autos, month-over-month, March (1.0% expected, 0.2% during prior month), Retail Sales excluding autos and gas, month-over-month, March (0.0% expected, -0.4% during prior month), Retail Sales Control Group, March (-0.1% expected, -1.2% during prior month), Import Price Index, month-over-month, March (2.3% expected, 1.4% during prior month), Import Price Index excluding petroleum, month-over-month, March (1.0% expected, 0.7% during prior month), Import Price Index, year-over-year, March (11.9% expected, 10.9% during prior month), Export Price Index, month-over-month, March (2.2% expected, 3.0% during prior month), Export Price Index, year-over-year, March (16.6% during prior month), Initial jobless claims, week ended April 9 (173,000 expected, 166,000 during prior week), Continuing claims, week ended April 2 (1.500 million expected, 1.523 during prior week), Business Inventories, February (1.3% expected, 1.1% prior), NAHB Housing Market Index, March (81 expected, 82 in February), University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment, April preliminary (59.0 expected, 59.4 during prior month), U. of Mich.

4/12/2022,"Milwaukee Bucks champion Giannis Antetokounmpo, 27, is extremely careful about preserving his hard-earned coins and has accounts at 50 different banks containing $250,000, revealed his team’s co-owner Marc Lasry to Bloomberg News. The two-time NBA MVP is utilizing the total standard deposit insurance coverage limit of $250,000 at each Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, or the FDIC-insured bank, according to the New York Post. Hedge fund manager and billionaire Lasry, who is the founder of Avenue Capital Group, a private equity firm, advised Antetokounmpo and his teammates on better investment practices, the New York Post reports. “I spend a lot of time with them explaining where they should invest,” Lasry said at the Bloomberg Wealth Summit in New York, according to Bloomberg News. “I’m like, ‘Giannis, you can’t be having accounts at 50 different banks. Let me tell you something, if JPMorgan goes under, your little dinky banks are going to go under too. Let me explain what you should buy, you should buy U.S. Treasuries, you should buy this’.” Born in Greece, Antetokounmpo, 27, is understandably concerned about maintaining his solvency, considering he witnessed his country endure one of the most severe debt catastrophes during the 2010s. As a result, banks closed down and reduced account holders from withdrawing cash, BBC reports. Antetokounmpo has accrued a sizeable fortune of $146,344,879 from playing basketball and cleared $47 million from endorsements in 2021, Forbes reports. He recently made his first brand investment with Ready Nutrition, a sports nutrition company that created a line of products that include sports drinks, protein water, and plant-based snacks and powders, Team Ready reports. “Nutrition is a really big part of being an athlete. You’ve got to be really careful what you put in your body…I liked that it’s all-natural and doesn’t have much sugar like other products. Through the years, I got better, faster and stronger, so it was a no-brainer to join Ready,” said Antetokounmpo, according to Entrepreneur.",Business/Black Enterprise•yesterday,Giannis Antetokounmpo Put His Money In 50 Banks Until His Team Owner Taught Him Investing,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/giannis-antetokounmpo-put-money-50-143319084.html
4/12/2022,"Banks will kick off earnings season this week, with first-quarter results due out from a lineup of industry heavyweights led by JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday. The latest quarterly figures are expected to preface a lackluster year for bank profits despite the lift anticipated from higher interest rates. According to projections compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence, U.S. bank earnings will fall by more than 8% in 2022 from last year, namely as the financial boost from releasing reserves that padded profits in 2021 winds down. “Earnings last year were driven so heavily by reserve releases — we saw earnings almost double year-over-year,” S&P Global Market Intelligence lead banking analyst Nathan Stovall told Yahoo Finance. Bank balance sheets benefited last year from the release of COVID-era credit loss allowances, reserves financial institutions accumulated at the start of the pandemic to absorb the potential shock of borrowers being unable to pay their debts. As the economy recovered and losses proved less severe than expected, big banks began to release those reserves, giving their earnings a meaningful boost. In the third quarter of 2021, for example, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank, saw quarterly revenue jump by more than $2 billion as it continued to release reserves previously set aside for possible loan defaults during the pandemic. The mega bank blew analyst forecasts to report a profit of $11.69 billion, which without $2.1 billion in reserve releases would have been $9.59 billion — largely unchanged from the prior year. “We’re not going to get that same juice this year, and higher rates definitely help, but not enough to match that performance,” Stovall said. “Throughout 2021, you saw reserves steadily decline, and as they fell, those decreases hit the bottom line.” A backdrop of higher interest rates is set to increase banks’ net interest income (the bank’s earnings on its lending activities and interest it pays to depositors) and net interest margins (calculated by dividing net interest income by the average income earned from interest-producing assets.) However, the boost may not be enough to match the tailwind that reserve releases provided to bank earnings last year, when reserves fell by $58.1 billion from 2020 levels, according to S&P Global. Additionally, “mountains” of excess liquidity accumulated through a surge in consumer deposits during the pandemic, especially as loan activity remains tepid, is expected to continue to pressure bank revenues — particularly for commercial banks, where the extra cash resides in low-interest accounts and places a drag on net interest margins. Although S&P Global Market Intelligence expects a pickup in loan growth, which will allow banks to deploy some of the estimated $4 trillion in excess liquidity and improve margins, even if liquidity decreases in 2022, 2023, and 2024 as the firm expects, excess liquidity will remain above $3 trillion. “Even if you had just unprecedented loan growth over the next few years, you wouldn't return to a pre-pandemic level, in terms of the loan-to-deposit ratio,” Stovall told Yahoo Finance. With interest rate increases and the Federal Reserve scaling back its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet, S&P Global Market Intelligence projects bank margins to expand by 21 basis points in 2022 to 2.69%, but the figure is likely to return to pre-pandemic levels in excess of 3.30% until 2026. While the Fed’s monetary tightening is expected to improve bank’s net interest margins and loan growth is poised to improve, the margin boosts won’t be enough to offset the pressure of excess liquidity or the fading benefit of reserve releases on revenue — and bank earnings are expected to decline in 2022 as a result. For most of the industry, however, the projected earnings growth and resultant returns will be seen as favorable by the industry, according to Stovall. — Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

4/12/2022,"Whether you're saving for a down payment, renovation or upcoming nuptials, you might be looking for a place to park your cash until you need it. Short-term investments might not offer big returns like long-term investments, but they can help reduce risk, yield growth and remain easily accessible. So, if you have a lump sum of money ready to invest, here are some ideas to put $100,000 into a short-term investment. A financial advisor can help you create a financial plan for your investment needs and goals. What Are Short-Term Investments? A short-term investment is a financial investment that is temporary. You may only plan to invest in it for five years or less. Investors use this type of investment so they can preserve their capital and try to generate a return. Short-term investments are generally considered less risky. However, the less risk associated with an investment means you don't have as much growth potential to earn a big return as you would with a long-term investment. On the other hand, if you intend to keep your money invested for longer than five years, you may consider long-term investments that have a higher potential for growth. As an example, you may consider investing in the stock market, which has historically yielded a 10% return on average. However, the stock market is also pretty volatile. So, having your money invested for a longer time horizon gives you a chance to recuperate your losses during down years. Best Ways to Invest $100k Short Term If you want to put $100,000 into a short-term investment, here are six options worth considering: High-Yield Savings Account You can open a high-yield savings account at a bank or a credit union. Although high-yield savings accounts may offer minimal interest, usually between 1% and 2.2%, they still offer a place to stash your cash and help your money grow. To find the best high-yield savings account with the highest interest rate, it's wise to compare your options since every bank or credit union has different terms and offerings. Make sure when comparing your options, you identify banks and credit unions that are insured by either the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) at banks or by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). This way, you don't risk losing your money. Also, you usually have access to your money with this type of account. Most banks and credit unions let you take six withdraws or transfer per payment cycle. However, make sure to watch out for maintenance fees or ATM fees that could dip into your interest. Money Market Accounts A money market account is another type of savings or deposit account. Money market accounts usually yield higher interest rates than basic savings accounts but still enjoy FDIC protection. However, some financial institutions may require that you deposit a minimum amount to open the account. Like checking accounts, you have direct access to your money and can typically write checks or make withdrawals from your account. Keep in mind, the number of transactions usually comes with restrictions to comply with federal law. The biggest risk you run with a money market account is keeping up with inflation since the interest is minimal. However, since you're only investing for a short period, this might not be a concern at all. Money Market Funds Money market funds, also called money market mutual funds, are low-risk, conservative investments for investors interested in the safety of their principal. These funds invest in high-quality, highly liquid cash equivalents and short-term debt securities with a maturity of one year or less. Minimum balances tend to be high, sometimes as high as $1,000,000. Though not FDIC insured they offer a higher interest rate than money market accounts. There are four types of money market funds. The securities in which each invests conforms to the type of fund it is: Treasury Funds: These funds invest in Treasury bills, bonds and notes that are frequently traded. Prime Funds (also called General Purpose Funds): They invest in non-Treasury securities like floating-rate debt and commercial paper of U.S. government agencies, corporations and government-sponsored entities. Government Funds: Government funds invest 99.5% of their assets in cash, Treasury securities and repurchase agreements. All investments have to be collateralized by cash and cash equivalents like U.S. government securities. Tax-exempt Funds: These funds invest in municipal bonds and other securities which are free from federal income taxes and often state taxes. These funds have a lower return than other money market funds due to their tax-exempt status. Cash Management Accounts A cash management account is a useful financial instrument that integrates segments of investment, savings, and checking accounts. You can find these accounts along with tax-advantaged investment accounts and brokerage accounts offered through online brokerages for you to manage your money from one location. The option to link your investment account to your cash management account at the same brokerage may be an option if you don't want to keep them apart. Like checking accounts, these accounts can be used to keep your money or pay your bills. You can also gain interest on your balance, similar to a savings account. The interest rate you may earn could be higher than a credit union or conventional bank. You have the option to use a CMA instead of a traditional checking or savings account or in addition to either of them. To reassure you that your money is safe, CMAs are usually FDIC insured. Short-Term Corporate Bonds When large companies need funding for an investment, they may issue corporate bonds to pay for an initiative. Usually, corporate bonds are considered a safe investment that pays interests regularly, typically monthly, quarterly, or bi-annually. You can sell corporate bonds on financial markets when they are open, meaning they are a liquid investment. So, when you're ready to sell, you won't have to worry about accessing your cash in a hurry. These types of bonds are a combination of different corporate bonds from companies of all sizes and industries. The diversification built into the bond helps minimize the risk. This means that if one of the corporate bonds doesn't perform, it won't drastically impact your overall return on investment. Keep in mind, though, short-term corporate bonds are not backed by the government. In other words, there is a chance you could lose money. However, bonds are generally a safe bet, especially if you invest in a diversified group of them. Also, fluctuating interest rates don't impact the price of the bond. So, you won't have to worry about that when you go to sell your bonds. No-Penalty Certificates of Deposits (CD) A no-penalty certificate of deposit, or CD, allows you to ditch the average fee from a bank if you happen to cancel your CD prior to maturity. CDs can be found at your bank; typically, you can gain a higher return from them than other options like a money market or savings account. CDs are interest-gaining accounts that have a maturity date. So, when you open one, you consent to keep your money in this account for the specified length of time. This can span from lengths of weeks to years; it is dependent on the maturity you want to reach. You will receive a higher interest rate in return for keeping the money secure in your account. The CD interest is paid systematically. When the agreed term has been reached, your bank will give you back your principal investment in addition to the interest gained. In a time of climbing interest rates, a no-penalty CD may be ideal. You have the option to withdraw your investment without a penalty fee so that you can invest somewhere else with a higher rate of return. The FDIC insures CDs, ensuring you don't lose any money with this investment. While short-term CDs come with minimal risks, one possible gamble is missing out on a higher interest rate available somewhere else while your funds are locked into the CD. You could also lose purchasing power due to inflation if the interest rate is too low. Short-term U.S. Government Bonds Similar to corporate bonds that are issued by companies, U.S. government bonds are issued by the government and other federal agencies. Government bonds are a combination of low-risk bonds funds from investments such as T-bills, T-notes, T-Bond, and mortgage-backed securities. Since these bonds are backed in full faith by the U.S. government, they are considered a safe investment. Since government bonds are one of the most traded investments on financial markets, they are considered very liquid. Also, interest rate fluctuation doesn't impact the funds of short-term bonds, so you won't need to worry about interest rate risk either. How to Determine the Best Short-Term Investment There is no one-size-fits-all solution for investing your money. You must consider the pros and cons of each investment to decide the best place to put your money. For example, if you know you need to have full access to your funds at any time, a CD might not be the best choice. This is because you might have to keep it invested for a specific amount of time. Plus, you may also have to pay the penalty to remove your money unless you select a no-penalty CD. So, a high-yield savings account may make the most sense since you want to be able to withdraw your money at any time without the additional hurdles. Bottom Line You have many options when determining the best way to invest $100k short term. First, revisit your financial goals and review the ins and outs of each option to pinpoint the right solution for you. While short-term investments usually come with minimal risk when compared with long-term investments like stock, it's still essential to get familiar with the investment you're considering.

By sometime next year, the U.S. economy may be limping around like Tiger Woods this past weekend at the Masters (sorry Tiger, I had to go there — I was rooting for you to win though). And just like watching the legend's shaky performance at the Masters, it's almost hard to believe we are even sitting here pontificating on a recession. The unemployment rate is near record low levels. Sub-30 year olds have never felt more emboldened to change jobs five times in under three years to boost their LinkedIn profile (and yes, skills in some cases) and send out the proverbial ""personal news"" tweet to their 100 followers. Corporate profit margins remain near record highs as employers suck every last ounce of productivity from tired, overworked employees just wondering if their package of chicken thighs for dinner will cost them 20% more next week (inflation has increased the cost of my chicken breasts — damn shame). Yours truly was turned away by four shops on Saturday for a paint job on his classic General Motors car. The common theme: ""Bro, we just have too much business at the moment to pull bumpers off your old ass car... sorry, but not sorry."" I only wanted a white paint job!! Insane to be thinking about a looming recession given all of these examples? The last recession lasted just two months in 2020 from February to April, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The economy has recovered so much since then. Yet, here we are with recession worries beginning to pick up in financial circles (but oddly, not the stock market). A few recent hot takes on this ""growth slowdown"" worth mentioning are below. Deutsche Bank Chief U.S. economist Matthew Luzzetti in a new note: ""While timing the exact quarters of negative growth is never easy, we see the Fed's tightening beginning to materially slow growth in the second half of 2023. Our baseline forecast has negative quarters for growth in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, consistent with a recession during that time. The mild recession we anticipate should nonetheless lead to a meaningful rise in unemployment, which peaks above 5% in 2024."" Luzzetti pealed back his call further on Yahoo Finance Live. Morgan Stanley Chief economist Seth Carpenter on Yahoo Finance Live: ""If you think about what the Fed itself thinks is the long-run sustainable growth rate of the economy, they think that rate of growth is below 2%. And so if you take a growth rate in the economy that's above 5% or 6%, and you're going to try to bring it down to below 2%, that 4-plus percentage point deceleration is just a massive, massive deceleration to happen, even if it happens over the course of two years or so. So I think no two ways about it, the slowing in the economy has to be dramatic."" RBC Capital Markets head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvasina on Yahoo Finance Live: ""I will tell you that RBC's economists are not making that [recession] call right now. They think the recession risks have grown, and they're monitoring them very vigilantly, but they actually have changed their forecasts recently and pulled us down to 2 and 1/2% [growth] for this year. And they are not making the recession call for next year yet. I actually pushed my economist the other day, and I said, what if we end up having a recession? What does it look like? Because you're seeing very different market reactions in terms of both multiples and stock prices in different contraction periods economically. And he said, look, I think if we get this, it's going to be something that's more of the milder variety. I think that's really interesting because the discussion hasn't quite gone there yet on the Street. People are kind of focused on yes or no. But I do think that that's probably the next place the conversation is going to go."" Levi's CFO Harmit Singh on Yahoo Finance Presents: ""We’re mining information each day. We’re speaking to economists regularly. The state of the buyer within the U.S. is actually robust. Balance sheets are robust. Unemployment is at an all-time low. Wage progress is going on."" Singh added Levi's is not seeing ordering cancellations by retailers, which are usually a telltale sign of slowing economic growth. As to why this recession chatter has intensified, pick your poison. Gas prices are above $4 a gallon, hitting consumers hard in the wallet. Inflation for everyday items is rampant. The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, which is already beginning to hit the U.S. housing market. I am sure I left out a few things, but that is the current state of play. Whether a recession happens is anyone's guess? But you can best believe the economy has slowed, and with that will likely cause an upheaval in the markets sometime soon. In the meantime, markets will probably limp along like Tiger. Happy trading! Chart of the day: Curious on why Costco's stock is trading at a record high (you shouldn't be, I have been talking about this a lot) and Walmart's shares have rocketed 12% in the past month? This helpful chart from Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink says a lot. Costco and Walmart's Sam's Club continue to see strong store traffic as consumers buy cheaper gas from each and then go into the store to buy items in bulk to save money. Stat to consider: As discussed here, the Fed's move on interest rates has already begun to chip away at the housing market's resilience (and shares of home-related stocks such as Home Depot and Lowe's). Good stat to ponder from LPL Financial Chief economist Jeffrey Roach: ""Several months ago, a prospective homebuyer would pay $1,347 for a $300,000 loan at 3.50%. If the buyer waited until this week to lock in a new rate at 5.00%, the borrower would pay $263 more per month. For most households, an additional cost of $263 per month will cut into discretionary spending, and prospective buyers will reconsider housing options.""

It's brutal. 2023 is shaping up to be a ""breakout"" year for Tesla, says Teslarati.
