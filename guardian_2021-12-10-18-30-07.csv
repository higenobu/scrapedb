12/10/2021,"The Glenfarclas Crystal Cup over the cross-country fences at Cheltenham on Friday is a virtual re-run of the contest over the same course at the November meeting, albeit with a few minor adjustments to the weights, as the first seven home are all back for another crack at these unique obstacles. Just two lengths separated the first four last month, when Diesel D’Allier (3.00) hit the front before the second-last only to be run out of it in the closing stages by Back On The Lash and Singing Banjo.  That was the grey’s first start since April, however, and also his first since a switch to Richard Bandey’s stable over the summer. He is better off with the first two home this afternoon and may not need to improve to register his second success over the cross-country course. Cheltenham 1.50 A tight and competitive mares’ handicap chase, but Timeless Beauty could offer a little value against the market leaders, Rose Of Arcadia and Fontaine Collonges. Fergal O’Brien’s mare posted a decent time when making a successful debut over fences at Lingfield last month on her first start for the yard and will not need to find too much improvement to defy a 6lb rise in the weights. Bangor-On-Dee 2.05 Happy Hollow is rising 10 but was off the track for nearly five years earlier in his career and remains lightly-raced over timber. He ran well on his return to action in October, finishing just over three lengths behind a well-handicapped opponent, and will be tough to beat off the same mark today.

He was running well in this race 12 months ago when he unseated two out, and also put up his best performance of the campaign when finishing a close second at Haydock Park first time up. Cheltenham 3.35 It seems an odd thing to suggest about a Grade One winner, but Sporting John did not really take to chasing last season and looked much more at home back over hurdles when successful at the November meeting here.

12/10/2021,"The police are investigating the unexplained death of a man at Faslane nuclear submarine base on the Clyde. Officers were called to HM Naval Base Clyde, 33 miles west of Glasgow, at about 12.30pm on Thursday.  Sky News and the Sun reported the dead man was a member of the Royal Navy. A Police Scotland spokesperson said: “A postmortem examination will be carried out to establish the exact cause of death, which is currently being treated as unexplained. A report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.” A Royal Navy spokesperson said: “We are aware of an incident and cannot comment further at this stage.” Faslane is the base for all the UK’s nuclear submarines, including the four-member fleet of Vanguard-class boats that carry the UK’s Trident missiles, and the Astute-class fleet of hunter-killer submarines.

12/10/2021,"On Thursday, the Uyghur Tribunal delivered its damning judgment on the human rights abuses allegedly committed by the Chinese state in Xinjiang. Over the past months this London-based people’s tribunal has heard testimony from international scholars as well as survivors of Chinese detention and “re-education camps”. While the ruling has no legal standing, the aim is to highlight the treatment of Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other Turkic Muslims in north-west China. Rachel Harris, a British ethnomusicologist and Uyghur specialist, has described the state’s strategy as an attempt “to hollow out a whole culture and terrorise a whole people”.  Much has been written about the destruction of the Uyghur heritage: of the mosques and shrines, old city centres and traditional burial grounds. In order to understand what intangible heritage is being lost – what is being quite literally silenced – amid that bulldozing, I interviewed 10 specialists, including both Uyghurs in exile and international scholars with extensive experience on the ground. In Muslim soundscapes the world over, the adhan is the most salient of notes. Calls to prayer, though, have long been absent from urban Uyghur life and now, even private devotion has reportedly been muted. Through a policy called “becoming family”, government officials are sent to stay in Uyghur homes so as to root out anything deemed illegal (owning Uyghur-language books, wearing traditional clothing). Academics and pop culture figures have been disappeared en masse, among the estimated 1.5 million people detained in “re-education” camps, with children as young as one separated from parents and put in Mandarin-language state orphanages. Schools have been banned from teaching Uyghur and no Uyghur-language books have reportedly been published in China since 2017. “People used to bury their books,” the American photographer Lisa Ross tells me, “but now they’re afraid to even do that.” In a bid to cut off an indigenous culture at the root, the Uyghurs language, sound and music are being excised from the public and private spheres. When Darren Byler, an anthropologist from Colorado, lived in Urumchi in the early 2010s, student house parties – which were held most weekends – always involved everyone making music together. Friends would bring instruments. People were always singing. “Everyone is a poet,” he says. “People think poetically.” As a Turkic language, Uyghur is agglutinative, explains Byler, so they would often have fun adding rhyming suffixes to the ends of their words. This verbal dexterity defines ancient storytelling forms like the epic dastan – spoken tales – that pilgrims would hear at festivals in the Taklamakan desert. It also birthed a vibrant local hip-hop scene in Urumchi that Byler came to know. Now, all gatherings – prayer in public, mazar (shrine) festivals, traditional meshrep parties, hip-hop cyphers, even football matches – have been outlawed. Destroying a built structure makes visible the dismantlement of more abstract cultural ones. The mazar, which are dotted throughout the desert as well as in towns and cities, are a case in point. Before they were razed, these shrines were closed. This resulted in the rural community structures and ancient cultural practices that activated them being shut down, too. Mazar festivals would be held every Thursday at certain periods of the year: throughout the mulberry season at Imam Asim shrine, say, or during grape season at Kok Marim shrine. Starting in the early 2000s, Ross documented the mazar extensively. She photographed mountains of hand-made prayer flags and devotional objects affixed to wooden poles that day pilgrims – in their tens of thousands – would bring each year. A Uyghur scholar, who wishes to remain anonymous, describes what it felt like to be there. At Imam Asim, there were tandoori pots the size of small rooms, in which a gaggle of men with shovels would stir a stew called sheeylang. Pilgrims would add in whatever they could (a sheep they’d brought to slaughter on site; a single grain of rice). And the sound? “It’s like a wedding and a funeral happening at the same time,” the scholar tells me. There would be epic dastan sessions, stories reminding pilgrims of why they came and where they come from. There would be dancing, drumming, chanting, weeping, praying. “It is something you won’t hear anywhere else.” When Harris and Rahile Dawut – a Uyghur folklore expert who disappeared four years ago and whose imprisonment has since been confirmed – visited the largest and oldest shrine, Ordam Padishah, in 1995, they wrote that state opposition to the shrines lay arguably in the sphere of aesthetics – the sights and sounds – rather than in response to any political threat. The site was closed to the public in 1997 and satellite imagery now shows it has been entirely razed. Imam Asim, too. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute puts the number of mosques, mazar and cemeteries in Xinjiang that have been damaged or destroyed since 2017 at up to 80%. Elsewhere, a re-engineered version of living Uyghur culture has been instituted. This process is best illustrated by what has happened to meshrep. In this uniquely Uyghur festive tradition, music and storytelling are used to transmit cultural or moral knowledge. But when China sought for meshrep to be included on Unesco’s intangible cultural heritage list in 2009, Harris, who was acting as official examiner, pushed back. “I thought the only way for meshrep to be sustained would be by folkloric presentation,” she says. Unesco nonetheless granted China the heritage status it wanted and China promptly banned grassroots gatherings. Villages now have state-sanctioned meshrep centres with murals featuring slogans – “Everyone let’s dance”; “Welcome to our meshrep” – that drive home the notion of what is “healthy” (ie, acceptable) meshrep, and what isn’t. Religious lyrics are rewritten as revolutionary patriotism. Uyghurs are forced to attend. Performers also have to take part in exoticised song-and-dance spectacles that cater to the growing national tourism industry. “You can see them on YouTube,” says Harris, “and I mean, they are amazing.” But, she says, these shows turn the Uyghur people into “empty vessels who sing and dance and smile for tourists, but have no rights to develop their own culture or religion.” I speak to Mukaddas Mijit, a Uyghur academic, filmmaker and dancer who was born in Urumchi in the 1980s. She first left Xinjiang for Paris in the early 2000s to pursue classical piano studies but when she realised no one in France knew anything about where she came from, she pivoted to ethnomusicology and delved into her family’s history. She discovered her great-grandfather had been a Sufi master. “I came to my heritage through my studies,” she says. “It became my life.” Last year, Mijit and Harris organised an online event billed as the first transcontinental Uyghur concert. Under the banner “Longing for Home”, musicians from across the globe played from the classical muqam repertoire for two hours. It brought Mijit to tears. “It is really beautiful to hear this music,” she said. “Beautiful song, beautiful poetry. This is us, this is our voice, this is our culture.” Exile has always been a potent musical metaphor. But in the context of the Uyghur people’s plight, it is not imagery. It is an emergency.",Arts/Art and design,‘This is our voice’: The Uyghur traditions being erased by China’s cultural crackdown,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/dec/10/this-is-our-voice-the-uyghur-traditions-being-erased-by-chinas-cultural-crackdown
12/10/2021,"Japanese city pop is an enigmatic genre. Emerging in the late 1970s and peaking in popularity throughout the 80s, it was a soundtrack to the country’s economic boom and newly christened “leisure class”: a loosely defined grouping of Japanese-language music influenced by American styles such as yacht rock, R&B, funk and boogie. Recent years have seen a renewed interest in the genre among western audiences spurred on by cratedigging and YouTube. It has spawned expertly curated compilations, such as Light in the Attic’s 2019 album Pacific Breeze and, from We Want Sounds, 2020’s Tokyo Dreaming. Japanese label Nippon Columbia’s archive-raiding Tokyo Glow is the latest, producing 18 tracks of city pop that exemplify the genre’s wide-ranging diversity.  Curated by DJ Notoya, the compilation plays as a paean to the spending power of major Japanese labels throughout the 80s and the open-eared aptitude of their artists. Able to provide top session musicians filling out horn sections, orchestral strings and backing vocals, each track plays as a sumptuously warm instrumental experience. Opener Kimagure is taken from actress Kumi Nakamura’s only album release and features her Patrice Rushen-style silken vocal atop a mid-tempo boogie bassline; Indo No Michibata continues that fusion funk feel with a horn section that references US R&B band Tower of Power. But this is more than just a well-crafted replica of American styles. Each composition subtly subverts its reference points: Sumiko Yamagata’s balladic Minnie Riperton-style instrumentals are coupled with an eerie top-line synth; New Generation Company’s strutting funk, complete with vocoder banking, has a proto-techno feel; Mizuki Koyama goes full Drexciyan electro in the thundering opening to her Teena Marie-adjacent Oh! Daddy. Even though city pop is a genre largely coined in retrospect, Tokyo Glow’s varied selection is not a mere historical document. The compilation highlights these artists’ attention to instrumental detail and their delicate fusion of popular international styles with new technologies to create the sound of a city. It is one that is both of its time and still repeatedly listenable today. Réunion Island experimental composer Labelle releases his latest album Éclat (InFiné Music), a deconstructed selection of string quartet works reframing classical melody through Maloya rhythms and contemporary electronics. Tuareg group Imarhan’s third album, Aboogi (City Slang), is their first record made in their native southern Algeria; the resulting tracks interweave field recordings with dextrous guitar lines. Producer Shay Hazan fuses north African gnawa rhythms with vamping jazz horns on Reclusive Rituals (Batov Records), highlighting the earthy bass tones of the three-stringed gimbri in the process.",Arts/Music,Various Artists: Tokyo Glow review – radiant homage to Japanese city pop,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/10/various-artists-tokyo-glow-review
12/10/2021,"On Saturday, for the first time in their history, the Portland Timbers will host the MLS Cup final. Portland, who face New York City FC, are playing in their third MLS Cup final in seven seasons. But Timbers midfielder Eryk Williamson says the historic match brings a new level of anticipation. “It’s unbelievable because you see the games and the playoff games that we’ve been in and you’ve never felt this energy,” Williamson says.  More notably, the Timbers feature prominent Black players from three continents, such as Williamson, Dairon Asprilla and Yimmi and Diego Chará, who are up against NYC FC captain and goalkeeper Sean Johnson and Afro-Brazilian forward Talles Magno in one of the whitest cities in America. Those players represent the diversity within American soccer and the Black diaspora says Williamson. Portland became one of the focal points of last year’s racial justice protests that followed the police murder of George Floyd, with federal agents called into the city at one point. During the protests Williamson, who is a member of Black Players for Change, discussed increasing Black representation at the club with head coach Giovanni Savarese and general manager Gavin Wilkinson. “When you look at the players, we’ve done a good job at building a strong Black core,” Williamson says. But Portland, Oregon’s largest city, which is nowadays associated with its progressive, hipster culture, hasn’t always welcomed Black Americans and immigrants. The city has also been home to systemic racism and white supremacy since it was established in the 1800s. From 1857 to 1927, Black people were prohibited from entering Oregon, while Chinese Americans were banned from owning property in the state’s early history. The Ku Klux Klan was active in the state well into the 20th century, with 14,000-20,000 members by the mid 1920s. In 2017, Walidah Imarisha, an expert on Oregon’s Black history, told the Guardian that while “Portland spends a lot of time being incredibly self-satisfied”, the “foundation of Oregon as a state, and in fact the whole Pacific north-west, was as a racist white utopia”. Indeed, the state’s constitution included clauses such as “No free Negro, or mulatto, not residing in this state at the time of the adoption of this constitution, shall come, reside, or be within this State, or hold any real estate” until voters chose to remove it in 2000. When Williamson was traded from DC United’s academy to Portland in 2018, he says the small Black presence in the city was “eye-opening” compared to DC. Black people only make-up 6% of the city’s population (compared to around 12% of the US as a whole), a figure due in part to the practice of redlining that kept Black Portlanders from buying property in white neighborhoods. Black residents of the city were pushed to the floodlands of the Vanport housing project which was eventually wiped out when a dam broke. This history clashes with the public image of the club’s main supporters group, the Timbers Army, which is known for its progressive values. In 2019 the Timbers Army made international news when MLS banned its members from displaying the symbol of the anti-fascist Iron Front group (MLS subsequently reversed the ban after widespread outcry). Jeremy Wright, co-founder of the Timbers Army, says the organization actively upholds anti-racist values and has always acknowledged why Portland is a white city and the specific laws passed to keep Blacks out. “We’ve always tried to hold space around that and it’s always been a challenging conversation in our liberal white city,” says Wright. “It’s one thing to say it, but you have to actively stake out your claim and support your players.” Wright, like Williamson and former Timbers players Chris Duvall and Jeremy Ebobisse, marched during the 2020 social justice protests. Wright agrees with Williamson that Saturday’s match is a good stage for the team’s Black players. “We see this as our opportunity to clapback and say this is who we are and this is what we’ve built,” Wright says. “It’s important that a majority white city is embracing a team made up of Black men from around the world.” MLS also sees an opportunity to showcase the league’s diversity. At his annual State of the League Address this week, commissioner Don Garber highlighted the diversity and hiring policy updated by Sola Winley, MLS’s executive vice-president and chief DEI officer, in collaboration with Black Players for Change and the Soccer Collective on Racial Equality. The league is positioning itself to reflect the diversity of the US and Canada. “We are working on our diversity initiative to ensure we have more diversity in our front office and technical staff to reflect the diversity of our country and the increased number of Black players participating on our fields.” Garber says. “The goal is to increase representation, particularly, among the Black community.” That goal will hopefully get a little closer on Saturday.",Sport/Football,The Timbers face an MLS Cup final and their city’s troubling history with race,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/10/the-timbers-face-an-mls-cup-final-and-their-citys-troubling-history-with-race
12/10/2021," An ambivalent attitude towards drinking and its central role in society suffuses this Oscar-winning Danish drama from Thomas Vinterberg. Mads Mikkelsen uses his hangdog features to fine effect as worn-down teacher Martin, unhappily married and bored of trying to inspire his students. When he and three colleagues start taking daily doses of alcohol as a psychological experiment, they enjoy a brief kick of creativity and joie de vivre. However, their incipient addictions increasingly complicate relationships at work and home. Vinterberg, the director of similarly forensic dissections of social norms in Festen and The Hunt, avoids easy answers as tragedy unfolds.Sunday 12 December, 10.25am, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere For those unable to catch Jessie Buckley on stage in London in Cabaret, this 2019 film is more than enough evidence of her singing talent. She plays Rose-Lynn, a would-be country singer released from prison and returning to her two young children in Glasgow. The strain between her desire to make it big in Nashville and her parental responsibilities is constant, and her mother (a nicely underplaying Julie Walters) is left to deal with the fallout. Buckley is exceptional here, in her element on stage but giving coherence to Rose-Lynn’s wilfully destructive streak off it.Saturday 11 December, 9pm, Film4 You could never accuse Quentin Tarantino of cinematic restraint, and his 2003 action film (split into two halves) is the apogee of his maximalist approach. Largely a homage to the Shaw Brothers’ martial arts films, but also chucking in blaxploitation movies, spaghetti westerns, the samurai genre and anime, it stars Uma Thurman as the yellow-jumpsuited Bride. Betrayed and left for dead by her fellow assassin squad members, she takes revenge in bloody fashion. Vivica A Fox and Lucy Liu are her targets in a stunning flurry of slicing and dicing.Saturday 11 December, 9pm, TCM Movies The arrival of Maradona at Napoli in 1984 is the peg on which writer-director Paolo Sorrentino hangs his zesty, autobiographical coming-of-age tale. Filippo Scotti plays 17-year-old Fabietto who, amid the loves and betrayals, jokes and tragedies of his extended Naples family, tries to figure out his future. Influences include Sorrentino regular Toni Servillo as his flawed father, Ciro Capano’s challenging film-maker and his glamorous Aunt Patrizia (Luisa Ranieri), whose mental health problems add an unsettling note to a mostly sun-soaked dose of adolescent angst.Wednesday 15 December, Netflix The appearance of Astaire and Rogers films on our screens always presages the arrival of Christmas. Mark Sandrich’s 1934 musical, the duo’s second collaboration, has a few duds (Let’s K-nock K-nees was a dance that probably didn’t catch on) and gives Fred and Ginger a car chase. But it does show off their effortless grace in Cole Porter’s Night and Day and the set-piece number The Continental, as his dancer and her would-be divorcee miscommunicate their way to true love at the English seaside.Wednesday 15 December, 2.15pm, BBC Two Featuring the clean architectural lines, evergreen forests and moral complexity of an Alex Garland film, Benjamin Cleary’s poignant feature debut uses future tech to explore loss and the selflessness of love. Mahershala Ali is superb as Cameron, secretly terminally ill but expecting a second child with wife Poppy (a radiant Naomie Harris). He tentatively agrees to buy a “duplicate” – a clone that has all his memories and can replace him – unbeknown to his family. But as he and his double delve into his past experiences, Cameron’s doubts and deteriorating condition threaten that transition.Friday 17 December, AppleTV+ One of the most influential films of this century, and certainly nearing classic status, Jordan Peele’s 2017 directorial debut expands on the pointed comedy of his TV sketch show Key & Peele to chilling effect. Daniel Kaluuya’s Chris pays a visit to the family home of his white girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams), to find that her parents (Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford) are not the racially liberal types they appear to be. An excellent commentary on, and riposte to, the invisibility and marginalisation of Black people in the horror genre – and cinema in general.Friday 17 December, 11pm, E4",Arts/Film,Another Round to the Hand of God: the seven best films to watch on TV this week,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/10/another-round-to-the-hand-of-god-the-seven-best-films-to-watch-on-tv-this-week
12/10/2021,"Heathrow has said passenger numbers were 60% lower in November than before the coronavirus pandemic and there were “high cancellations” among business travellers concerned about being trapped overseas for Christmas as Omicron spreads. The UK’s largest airport said the government’s travel restrictions had dealt a fresh blow to travel confidence and predicted it was likely to take several years for passenger numbers to return to pre-pandemic levels.  This week ministers said passengers arriving in the UK would have to take a pre-departure Covid test, as well as a post-flight test, because of fears about the spread of the new variant. “[The] high level of cancellations by business travellers concerned about being trapped overseas because of pre-departure testing shows the potential harm to the economy of travel restrictions,” the airport said in an update. Heathrow said the drop in traveller confidence owing to the new travel restrictions had negated the benefit of reopening the all-important corridor to North America for business and holiday travel last month. Eleven African countries have been added to the government’s red list, requiring travellers to quarantine before reuniting with families. “By allowing Brits to isolate at home, ministers can make sure they are reunited with their loved ones this Christmas,” said John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive of Heathrow. “It would send a strong signal that restrictions on travel will be removed as soon as safely possible to give passengers the confidence to book for 2022, opening up thousands of new jobs for local people at Heathrow. Let’s reunite families for Christmas.” Heathrow said that if the government could safely signal that restrictions would be lifted soon, then employers at Heathrow would have the confidence to hire thousands of staff in anticipation of a boost in business next summer. The airport is expecting a slow start to 2022, finishing next year with about 45 million passengers – just over half of pre-pandemic levels. This week Tui, Europe’s largest package holiday operator, said it expected bookings for next summer to bounce back to 2019 levels. However, Heathrow said on Friday not to expect the aviation industry to recover for several years. “We do not expect that international travel will recover to 2019 levels until at least all travel restrictions (including testing) are removed from all the markets that we serve, at both ends of the route, and there is no risk of new restrictions, such as quarantine, being imposed,” the airport said.",News/UK news,Heathrow passenger numbers down 60% as cancellations mount,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/10/heathrow-passenger-numbers-down-60-as-cancellations-mount
12/10/2021,"More than 50 years on from their first recordings together, and 14 albums in, there’s not much mystery to a new release from Neil Young and Crazy Horse. The band will sound ragged, as if they have tumbled half-asleep into the studio; Young’s guitar solos will sound like forked lightning; there will be volume, but also the restraint that comes from not indulging in millions of overdubs. And so it proves. Barn – titled for its recording location (“Barn, high in the Rockies) – sounds much as you’d expect, although that’s a tribute to the ensemble’s reliability rather than a complaint about repetition.  Sometimes the old sounds are recontextualised in slightly different ways: on the brilliant Heading West, Young’s burning, acidic lead guitar is backed by rolling piano rather than yet more guitars and married to a melody that would shine on one of his classic albums. That’s one of a pair of tracks on which he’s fretting away at the past, and at movement; the other, Canerican, sees him recalling how “I was born in Canada, came south to join a band” and how that has shaped his identity. Barn highlights both the strengths and weaknesses of this set-up: They Might Be Lost barely feels like a song, just the same chords Young has been strumming all his adult life, yet it manages to be eternal and deeply moving. Equally – and this is a little like complaining fire is too hot – one can’t help but feel some of these songs sound as though they were being written as they were recorded. But that Crazy Horse sound? Well, they could more or less be playing Crazy Frog and it would still sound great.",Arts/Music,Neil Young and Crazy Horse: Barn review – reliably ragged and still sounding great,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/10/neil-young-and-crazy-horse-barn-review-reliably-ragged-and-still-sounding-great
12/10/2021,"Britons who kill endangered animals abroad for fun will not be able to bring their hunting trophies home, the government has announced. The proposed law will prevent big game hunters from bringing home body parts of 7,000 species including lions, rhinos, elephants and polar bears. It comes two years after the government pledged to introduce a ban.  The environment secretary, George Eustice, said the measure was expected to be one of the toughest in the world and would go beyond the government’s manifesto commitment by including near-threatened and threatened species as well as endangered ones. “We will be leading the way in protecting endangered animals and helping to strengthen and support long-term conservation,” he said. The ban will apply whether or not a trophy has been obtained from a wild animal or one bred in captivity specifically for the purpose of trophy hunting. Breaching the rules could land hunters in prison for up to five years. In the past two years about 300 trophies from endangered animals have been shipped to the UK, according to the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting. The campaign’s founder, Eduardo Gonçalves, noted that the government had not specified a timetable for implementing the legislation. He said: “The bill, as far as we’ve seen, looks to be in pretty good shape, but it has been two years since it was originally announced in the Queen’s speech, and many animals have been cruelly and needlessly killed in that time. So it is really imperative for the government to bring the bill to parliament as quickly as possible.” Gonçalves said ministers had told him the bill could come to parliament next spring or summer, by which time “potentially another 100 or more animals will be killed and their trophies brought back to Britain”. He said: “Delay costs lives: every week that goes by without this ban means more animals, including endangered species, are being shot by British hunters, and their trophies brought back to the country. Some of these species are careering towards extinction, and certainly the British public are very strongly opposed to trophy hunting.” Boris Johnson has called trophy hunting a “disgusting trade”, and his father, Stanley Johnson, has campaigned extensively in favour of a ban. Plans for a law banning hunting trophies were prompted by the shooting of Cecil the lion in 2015 by an American dentist, Walter Palmer, at a reserve in Zimbabwe. In 2019 the government consulted on plans for a ban, which received overwhelming public support.",News/UK news,British big game hunters to be banned from bringing trophies home,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/10/british-big-game-hunters-to-be-banned-from-bringing-trophies-home

Ben Jennings was named political cartoonist of the year for his portfolio throughout a turbulent year, while Henny Beaumont won Covid cartoon of the year for Lost Generation, a cartoon published in June about the plight of young people during the pandemic.  Accepting his honour, Jennings, whose work also appears in the i newspaper, said the year offered rich material to cartoonists: “The versatility of cartooning in its ability to take on subjects, capture moods and evoke a variety of responses made it a worthy medium to tackle a year like 2021. I never imagined when I was a kid scribbling with crayons that I’d be doing much the same as an adult to document a plague in real time.” Accepting her award, Beaumont said she was personally grateful but placed her work in a wider context: “Winning this award has felt really significant for me and it feels like there is a real move towards appreciating and recognising the contribution women are making to political cartooning and I am proud of being part of this movement.” She also referred to those whose lives she depicted in the winning image. “The cartoon is dedicated to all the young people who missed out on so much during lockdown, had such a tough time and took so seriously their responsibility to protect those more vulnerable than themselves.”",Opinion/Opinion,"Amid the pandemic, award-winning cartoons captured the public mood ",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/10/pandemic-award-winning-guardian-political-cartoons-ben-jennings-henny-beaumont
