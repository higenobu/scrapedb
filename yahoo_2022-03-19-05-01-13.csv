3/19/2022,"Warren Buffett’s long-term outlook on investments proved successful once again this week when Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) shares closed above $500,000. If there’s one thing that’s made Buffett one of the most successful investors in history, it’s his commitment to his strategy. A countless number of new investment techniques and algorithms have come and gone over the years, but Buffett has maintained his fairly simple strategy of picking solid companies and focusing on long-term growth while somehow ignoring the noise that sends most investors into a panic. It may seem odd that somebody with such a disciplined long-term approach to investing has no interest in purchasing real estate, especially since it's what vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Charles Munger used to build his fortune. There’s a Difference Between Buying Real Estate and Investing in Real Estate Buffett isn’t opposed to investing in real estate and has invested in several real estate investment trusts (REITs) over the years. However, he knows it makes little sense to get into the business of being a landlord. Buying and managing real estate is more of a business than it is an investment, and Buffett knows that his time is better spent choosing companies to invest in than it is running a real estate business. Real estate is a tough business and one that needs to be scaled to comprise several properties in order to build significant wealth. Many individual investors get into real estate with the misconception that it’s a passive investment, and most eventually exit those properties once realizing what they’ve actually gotten into. Investing in real estate is a different story. Passive real estate investments allow investors to reap the rewards of this profitable asset class without taking on the management responsibilities. The FTSE Nareit All Equity REITs index has outperformed the S&P 500 in total returns during 13 out of the last 20 years, producing an average total annual return of 13.1% versus 11.1% for the S&P 500. Many investors that have turned to the private markets for passive real estate investments have averaged even greater returns. For instance, the real estate crowdfunding platform CrowdStreet has produced an average internal rate of return (IRR) of 18.5% for investors on its fully realized deals since 2014. Related: Real Estate Crowdfunding Returns Compared Buying and managing real estate is a business with incredible profit potential, but it’s important to realize that it’s a business and not a passive investment. The returns realized through owning real estate are a direct result of the time, energy and money that goes into it. While that business has been the source of many great fortunes over the years, it’s just simply not a business that makes sense for most people.

3/19/2022,"* Biden urges Xi to abandon Moscow over Ukraine * FedEx falls on lower-than-expected quarterly earnings * Moderna up on seeking FDA authorization for second booster * Dow down 0.35%, S&P up 0.14%, Nasdaq gains 0.93% (Adds comments, updates prices to early afternoon) By Shreyashi Sanyal and Sabahatjahan Contractor March 18 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 indexes inched higher in volatile trading on Friday as megacap stocks gained ground, while investors assessed the talks between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping over the Ukraine crisis. Nvidia, Tesla, Apple and Microsoft rose between 0.6% and 2.9%, boosting the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Biden and Xi spoke on a video call, which lasted just under two hours, about Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Chinese media said Xi underlined that such conflicts are in no-one's interests. Biden was expected to tell the Chinese leader that Beijing would pay a steep price if it supports the invasion. ""The geopolitical concerns are responsible for the vast majority of the market movement this week, despite the fact that the Fed hiked interest rates,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. ""China is kind of involved a little bit more today than normal, and that's obviously a concern."" The day also marks ""triple witching"", where investors unwind positions in futures and options contracts before they expire which often leads to large unexpected moves in markets. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, with technology, consumer discretionary and communication services the only gainers, up between 0.5% and 1.1%. ""The bottom has been touched, and technology is down such a significant amount from its highs, it was bound to bring in people looking for opportunities,"" said Rick Meckler at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. Wall Street's main indexes tracked their biggest weekly gain since November 2020 after a rally that was fueled by hopes for progress in the Russia-Ukraine peace talks and a widely expected interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. The U.S. central bank on Wednesday also forecast an aggressive plan for further hikes while trimming economic growth projections for the year. At 11:43 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 119.47 points, or 0.35%, at 34,361.29, the S&P 500 was up 6.26 points, or 0.14%, at 4,417.93 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 126.45 points, or 0.93%, at 13,741.24. Moderna Inc gained 4.9% after the drugmaker submitted a request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to allow for a second booster of its COVID-19 vaccine. Shares of Boeing Co rose 0.7% on reports that the planemaker was edging towards a landmark order from Delta Air Lines for up to 100 of its 737 MAX 10 jets. U.S. delivery firm FedEx Corp fell 5.0% as it posted lower-than-expected quarterly earnings on Thursday. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.03-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.36-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 18 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 30 new highs and 25 new lows.

3/19/2022,"Warren Buffett is right to be devouring shares of oil giant Occidental Petroleum (OXY), says one long-time oil markets strategist. The billionaire investor's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) scooped up another 18.1 million shares of Occidental for close to $1 billion this week. The latest purchases come hot on the heels of Berkshire spending $6 billion or so in the prior two weeks to buy up Occidental shares. Berkshire now owns nearly 14.6% of Occidental Petroleum through his roughly 140 million shares. Energy expert and portfolio manager Rob Thummel of Tortoise Capital says there is more behind Buffett's buying binge than a play on elevated oil prices. ""Occidental is benefiting from the higher oil prices. The other factor a lot of energy companies are doing that is changing the game for energy companies and how investors perceive them, is that Occidental has actually embraced the energy transition and participating in it,"" Thummel said on Yahoo Finance Live. ""You'll hear them talk a lot of about carbon capture. When you combine the energy security that Occidental can provide, plus the energy transition that they are participating in, that has become a more compelling story for energy investors going forward."" Thummel says he doesn't own any shares of Occidental. Occidental's stock price has responded as one would expect when a whale like Buffett gets involved. Shares have skyrocketed 43% in the past month compared to the relatively unchanged S&P 500, per Yahoo Finance Plus data. During that same span, shares of oil majors ExxonMobil and Chevron are up 1% and 19%, respectively. Occidental will hold a key investor day on March 22. To be sure, Buffett will likely be listening very closely. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

Most Read from Bloomberg Putin Likely to Make Nuclear Threats If War Drags, U.S. Says Biden Team Hardens View of China Tilting to Putin on Ukraine Shock Waves From War in Ukraine Threaten to Swamp Sri Lanka Ukraine Update: Russia Again Shells Western Areas Around Lviv Putin Vows to Rid Russia of ‘Traitors’ While Waging Ukraine War Russia’s central bank has been relegated to the role of bit-part player as war and international sanctions devastate the country’s economy. A meeting in Moscow on Friday will be little more than a cameo for the Bank of Russia in an economic drama playing out across the world’s biggest country, as the wipeout of household wealth, food shortages and a dash for the exits by foreign companies and Russians shatter three decades of policy making after the Soviet collapse. Governor Elvira Nabiullina is headed into her first regular review of interest rates since the invasion of Ukraine led to sweeping sanctions and handcuffed the central bank after the seizure of an estimated two-thirds of its $643 billion in foreign reserves. Following an emergency hike that more than doubled the key rate to 20%, the central bank is set to keep the benchmark at the highest in almost two decades, according to all but five of the 31 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The rest forecast increases of three to five percentage points. “The emergency hike had the goal of limiting deposit outflows and, together with the tight foreign-currency restrictions, apparently it had an impact,” said Olga Belenkaya, economist at Investment Co. Finam in Moscow. “Inflation will renew records and can possibly come close to 20% in the coming weeks.” Capital controls, a shuttered stock market and the seizing up of trade are taking the spotlight off interest rates as the go-to tool for restoring calm at home. Before the war, the central bank won economists’ praise for delivering three 100 basis-point hikes in less than a year to get a grip on inflation. The Bank of Russia has yet to revise its forecasts for inflation and the economy after the invasion, but annual price growth already reached an estimated 12.54% as of March 11, from just above 9% at end-February. After the central bank makes an announcement at 1:30 p.m. in Moscow, Nabiullina will explain the decision at 3 p.m. But in a departure from recent months, she will take no questions from reporters, repeating the format she used following the emergency rate move on Feb. 28. What Our Economists Say: “The central bank faces tough choices, and the only comfort may be that it’s too soon for action on rates. A reduction would help prevent a credit crunch, but nose-bleed rates are probably still needed to compensate deposit holders, especially as inflation spikes.” --Scott Johnson. The U.S. Federal Reserve has meanwhile signaled hikes at all six remaining meetings this year after raising rates by a quarter point on Wednesday, its first increase since 2018. Major emerging markets from Brazil to South Africa have also opted to elevate borrowing costs to contain price pressures. But the severity of economic challenges is sidelining monetary policy in Russia. The war and the fallout that followed have inflicted a domestic toll that’s already comparable to the worst downturns of President Vladimir Putin’s more than two decades in power. Adding to the inflation shock, Russia is seeing shortages of food staples while imported goods are growing increasingly scarce. Putin said this week that the nation survived “the economic blitzkrieg” but warned of rising joblessness and faster inflation to come. “Monetary policy has moved backstage,” VTB Capital economists Alexander Isakov and Rodion Latypov said in a note. “The financial account is, for practical purposes, closed, which means that the domestic interest rate policy is less sensitive to external developments.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Broke Oligarch Says Sanctioned Billionaires Have No Sway Over Putin A Once Radical Idea to Close the Wealth Gap Is Actually Happening Russia’s Brain Drain Becomes a Stampede for the Exits U.S. Work-Permit Backlog Is Costing Immigrants Their Jobs The 18 Minutes of Trading Chaos That Broke the Nickel Market ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•16 hours ago,War Handcuffs Russian Central Bankers Watching Demise of Economy,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/war-handcuffs-russian-central-bankers-040000783.html
3/19/2022,"ProShares has entered the nascent market of metaverse ETFs, hoping to use its prominence in the ETF space to take market share from existing competitors. The ProShares Metaverse ETF (VERS) debuted on the NYSE Arca Thursday with an 0.58% expense ratio. VERS tracks a Solactive index following companies that generate at least half of their revenues from metaverse-related activity based on a scan of public company filings. The index rebalances and reconstitutes semiannually. The metaverse already has three ETFs representing it: the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV), the Fount Metaverse ETF (MTVR) and the Subversive Metaverse ETF (PUNK). METV is the closest comparison to VERS, as both are index-based and cost substantially the same. VERS is 1 basis point cheaper than METV, and the top holdings have substantial overlap. The two funds share Apple, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Unity Software and Microsoft among their top 10 holdings, with those companies amounting to 32.2% of METV’s exposure and 34.9% of VERS exposure. (Use our stock finder tool to find an ETF’s allocation to a certain stock.) In an interview, ProShares’ Executive Director of Thematic Investing Scott Helfstein said VERS’ index leans more toward companies that are building the physical parts and data storage infrastructure needed to run the metaverse rather than firms trying to re-create their real-world brands into the online world. He also argues ProShares’ name recognition will give it an advantage over Roundhill, Fount and Subversive Capital, the three existing metaverse fund issuers that have approximately $1.25 billion in ETF assets combined. “The three players that are currently out there are effectively startups, and there really is no established scale player offering a product in this space,” he said.

3/19/2022,"By Mohi Narayan NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Reliance Industries Ltd, operator of the world's biggest refining complex, may avoid buying Russian fuels for its plants following Western sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, a senior company official said. ""Even if we can source some of the feeds (from Russia), probably we will be out of it because of the sanctions,"" Rajesh Rawat, senior vice president and business head cracker, told an industry event on Wednesday. Reliance buys Urals crude and straight run fuel oil for its refineries from Russia. The private refiner mostly buys its petrochemical feedstock from the Middle East and the United States. Sanctions on Russia have prompted many companies and countries to shun its oil, depressing Russian crude to record discount levels. Rawat said in India most of the oil supplies from Russia are going to the state-run companies. ""So probably, those feed streams will still continue, or may have a lesser impact compared to the private sector players. Because we deal with banks, and also even if we can source some of the feeds (from Russia), probably we will be out of it because of the sanctions,"" Rawat told the Asia Refining and Petrochemical Summit. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, India's top refiner Indian Oil Corp has bought 3 million barrels of Russian Urals crude and Hindustan Petroleum has bought 2 million barrels of the oil through tenders.

3/19/2022,"Major Chinese Android smartphone brands are seeing robust demand this month in Russia, boosted by increased local consumer spending on essential electronics devices, as international sanctions against the invasion of Ukraine sent the rouble in free fall. ""Russian retailers are setting the price higher every few days to make up for the exchange loss,"" said Ivan Lam, Hong Kong-based analyst at Counterpoint Research. ""People are buying everything from smartphones to home appliances before the currency further depreciates."" Sales of smartphones from Huawei Technologies Co, Oppo and Vivo significantly increased in the first two weeks of March, according to a report by Russian daily newspaper Kommersant on Wednesday, citing data from the country's largest mobile network operator MTS.

The number of Huawei smartphones sold during that period was three times more than the previous two weeks, the report said. Sales of Oppo and Vivo devices surged 200 per cent in the same period, while those of ZTE Corp and Realme grew 100 per cent and 80 per cent, respectively. A woman walks past a board showing currency exchange rates of the Euro and the US dollar against the Russian rouble in Moscow, Russia, on March 11, 2022. Photo: Reuters alt=A woman walks past a board showing currency exchange rates of the Euro and the US dollar against the Russian rouble in Moscow, Russia, on March 11, 2022. Photo: Reuters> The brisk sales, however, signify panic buying because of the weakening rouble, rather than increased local preference for Chinese smartphone brands, according to Counterpoint's Lam. The rouble was trading at 104.47 to the US dollar on Thursday. Lam said the recent hefty sales numbers recorded by Chinese smartphone vendors are likely to decline soon, as many distributors in Russia have stopped making large imports from China because of exchange rate risks. Before that two-week period in March, total smartphone sales in Russia increased fourfold from February 24 to 28, compared with the previous four days, according to the Kommersant report. At the time, Apple's iPhone and Android smartphone models from Samsung Electronics and Xiaomi Corp were the most in demand in the local market. Apple, however, halted sales of the iPhone and its other highly prized products in Russia from March 1, following the country's invasion of Ukraine, saying the company stands ""with all of the people who are suffering as a result of the violence"". Samsung also paused its sales in Russia a few days later. To their advantage, the major Chinese smartphone brands had sufficient inventory in their local warehouses in Russia to meet the increased demand, following Apple and Samsung's moves to halt sales, according to Arkady Markaryan, head of smartphone business at AliExpress Russia. AliExpress, a global marketplace for overseas consumers to buy directly from manufacturers and distributors in China, is a major business under Alibaba Group Holding, owner of the South China Morning Post. But international sanctions on exporting hi-tech products to Russia, including payment and logistics restriction, have created a big challenge for Chinese technology companies that want to keep doing business in the country amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Transsion Holdings, a Shenzhen-based budget smartphone maker, recently said that it is relying on yuan payments to maintain its operations in Russia. Counterpoint's Lam, however, indicated difficulties with the yuan payment strategy. ""The industry is still using US dollars to calculate manufacturing costs and set prices of handsets, so it's hard to shift to yuan payment any time soon,"" he said. Semiconductors and other crucial components of smartphones are mainly supplied by companies in the US, South Korea and Japan, which all use US dollars to settle international transactions. Lam said major Chinese brands like Xiaomi, Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo must also consider if the risks of doing business in Russia far outweigh their ambition to expand sales in western Europe, where many people are protesting against the war in Ukraine. Washington may also impose new sanctions. Last week, US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo warned that the US could ""essentially shut"" down any Chinese companies defying sanctions by continuing to supply chips to Russia.

3/19/2022,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh CHICAGO (Reuters) - General Electric Co on Thursday said its Chief Executive Larry Culp would take a 67% cut to an incentive grant this year after shareholders last year rejected his compensation package in a non-binding but rare rebuke over executive pay. In its annual proxy statement filed on Thursday, the Boston-based industrial conglomerate said Culp's annual equity incentive grant for 2022 will be reduced to $5 million from $15 million. The company also disclosed Culp's annual compensation last year was about $22.7 million, down 69% from 2020, due to a reduction in stock awards. Proxy votes against executive pay at S&P 500 companies became more common last year and were often sparked by ""questionable practices and metrics,"" such as easier performance targets during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a report by shareholder advocacy group As You Sow. Among the S&P 500, a record 16 companies had the pay of their CEOs and other top leaders rejected by more than half of investors last year, up from 10 in 2020 and seven in 2019, the report said. As part of an extension of Culp's employment contract to 2024, GE in 2020 canceled old shares he had been given and granted him new shares tied to lower financial targets. The compensation package entailed a payout through 2024 of as much as $230 million. Some 57.7% of GE shareholders last year rejected the pay deal, according to preliminary results, which some proxy advisory firms argued was too generous. GE said in the proxy statement its board had gathered feedback from shareholders on the issue and tried to address concerns related to compensation matters. While defending the 2020 grant, the company said its board does not intend to enter into a similar modification of the CEO's employment agreement in the future. It also promised to use discretion sparingly in determining bonus pools. GE's annual shareholders meeting is scheduled in May.

3/19/2022,"Nearly 30 companies are ""digging in,"" defying public demands to exit Russia or reduce their activities in the pariah state, according to a list kept by a professor with the Yale School of Management. Among those operating undeterred: Authentic Brands' Reebok, Halliburton, Koch Industries, LG Electronics, and Subway, which has nearly 450 franchised locations in Russia. The list, launched several days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, is ""updated continuously"" by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, and his research team in a bid to ""reflect new announcements from companies in as close to real time as possible."" On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that Kansas-based Koch Industries ""will continue to operate its two glass manufacturing facilities in Russia,"" citing a Wednesday statement from Koch President and COO Dave Robertson that acknowledged the decision, affecting about 600 Guardian Industries employees. ""We have no other physical assets in Russia, and outside of Guardian, employ 15 individuals in the country,"" Robertson wrote. ""While Guardian's business in Russia is a very small part of Koch, we will not walk away from our employees there or hand over these manufacturing facilities to the Russian government so it can operate and benefit from them (which is what The Wall Street Journal has reported they would do)."" ""Doing so would only put our employees there at greater risk and do more harm than good."" Since the initial publication of the list during the week of Feb. 28, Sonnenfeld and fellow researchers have revised their categorization method. In a March 16 article for Fortune, Sonnenfeld acknowledged that the initial ""naughty and nice list ... smoothed over some of the complexities related to these companies' exits from Russia."" The revised list includes four categories: ""withdrawing all business,"" ""suspending operations,"" ""reducing activities,"" and ""economic collaboration."" There is no excuse for companies in the fourth, last, category, Sonnenfeld wrote for Fortune, which fell from 34 businesses Wednesday to 27 Thursday. ""Worst of all are the companies in category #4 that continue in Russia unabated,"" he wrote. ""Oil servicers such as Halliburton and Schlumberger remain economic collaborators despite U.S. sanction. I met Jean Riboud, the legendary former Schlumberger CEO who over several decades built Schlumberger into being the largest in the industry, a company that under his leadership was considered the best managed firm in the world.

3/19/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp is cutting its global production target in April to 750,000 vehicles, down 150,000 from an earlier plan, the automaker said on Thursday, as a semiconductor shortage and the COVID-19 pandemic bite into its plans. The news comes about a week after Toyota said it would scale back domestic production by up to 20% during the months of April, May and June to ease the strain on suppliers battling shortages of chips and other parts. ""It is still difficult to foresee the situation several months ahead, and there is a possibility the current plan will be revised downward,"" the company said in a statement. Average monthly global production for the period from April to June would be about 800,000, Toyota added. Its global vehicle production will be down 10% in May and 5% in June from previous estimates at the beginning of the year, said Toyota executive Kazunari Kumakura. The shortages have led the automaker to repeatedly change its production plan, frustrating suppliers and prompting President Akio Toyoda to call the interval from April through June an ""intentional cooling off"" period. Apart from the persistent chips shortage, Toyota faces a number of challenges. Curbs against COVID-19 forced it to suspend a joint venture with China's FAW Group in the northeastern city of Changchun. The automaker also cited logistical hurdles for suspension at a plant in Russia amid political uncertainty sparked by the Ukraine invasion, which Russia calls a special operation. These factors were not reflected in the April-June global production plan, Kumakura said, adding that while Toyota had not yet suffered specific impacts from the Ukraine crisis, it would look into short- and long-term risks.
