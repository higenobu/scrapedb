4/24/2022,"British banks that took 2021’s bumper profits as a sign of better things to come will be bracing themselves for disappointment this week. With the Covid pandemic waning, 2022 was meant to mark the slow return to normal: a rebound in international travel, economic growth, and interest rates up from record lows. Barclays’s former boss Jes Staley was particularly optimistic last year, saying that “tremendous pent-up demand” would lead to a robust economic recovery that would “carry through into 2022”. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has rattled global markets and jeopardised energy supplies – exacerbating already-soaring costs for consumers and businesses and resulting in a dimmer outlook for bank earnings. The UK’s cost-of-living crisis has arisen just months after the government ended Covid support schemes that not only kept companies and workers afloat but, by extension, helped banks avoid the surge in defaults that was feared at the start of the pandemic. But the broader effects of rising inflation and geopolitical tension are being felt worldwide, with JP Morgan’s boss, Jamie Dimon, warning last week that a recession was “absolutely” possible. It means the same banks that released billions of pounds’ worth of loan loss provisions last year, in the belief that the worst was over, will have to start clawing back that cash as borrowers fall on hard times. That will dampen earnings growth and forecasts at the UK’s big four lenders – Lloyds, NatWest, HSBC and Barclays – all of which are due to report first-quarter results over the coming week. For example, Barclays is expected to put aside £299m for potential defaults, up from £55m a year earlier, when Staley was predicting an economic boom. That is likely to contribute to a potential 45% slump in profits to £1.3bn, according to average analyst estimates. Similarly, HSBC is likely to put aside $934m (£715m) to protect itself against potential defaults in the first quarter, compared with the $435m it released at the start of 2021. That will play a part in slashing HSBC’s pre-tax profits by more than a third to $3.7bn, according to consensus estimates. Profits at Barclays and HSBC will also be affected by the end of the investment banking boom, as fewer companies raise money on the financial markets and hold back from mergers and takeovers. The ripple effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have generally made firms more cautious about launching deals or fundraising. British banks’ Wall Street counterparts have already felt the blow, with first-quarter profits nearly halving at JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citi. But the UK’s domestically focused lenders – including Lloyds and NatWest – will also feel the pinch. With customers more likely to default, banks have been tightening their lending criteria, meaning lower income from otherwise lucrative loans. Particular attention will be paid to the outlook for mortgages, after it emerged this month that banks were starting to take the cost-of-living crisis – including higher energy and grocery bills as well as the national insurance rise – into consideration when calculating how much to offer borrowers. Meanwhile, banks that have benefited from surging UK house prices, which increased demand for larger home loans, will be aware that the cost-of-living crisis is also likely to dampen house price growth over the coming year. That will hurt domestic lenders such as Lloyds, which owns Halifax– the country’s largest mortgage lender, considered a bellwether for the UK economy. Analyst forecasts published this month suggest pre-tax profits at Lloyds could fall by 25% to £1.4bn, while NatWest is estimated to see its own profits drop 20% to £755m.",News/Business,Bank bosses’ optimism darkens as war follows on the heels of Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/24/bank-bosses-optimism-darkens-war-covid
4/24/2022,"The sports minister Nigel Huddleston has confirmed that the government will launch an in-depth review of domestic women’s football this summer with the aim of helping it close the gap with the men’s game. The review will be independently chaired and supported by an expert advisory panel, with the DCMS saying it will look at developing the women’s game at elite and grassroots level. Its focus will also look at commercialisation, spectator support and media interest, publishling its findings by the end of the year. It follows the Fan led review of football governance, published in November last year by Tracey Crouch MP, which recommended a review of the women’s game. The Government is expected to publish its response to the review, with a focus on the men’s game, soon. The review comes as the women’s game gears up for a high-profile summer, with England hosting the Euros and the final being held at Wembley. More than 350,000 of the 700,000 tickets available for the tournament had been sold during pre-sales and a public ballot window, which means that the tournament has already past the record of 240,045 tickets sold for Euro 2017 in the Netherlands. In a statement issued on Saturday evening, Huddleston said: “Women’s football is a growing force. The 2019 World Cup captured the hearts and minds of the nation, and with greater participation, employment and visibility in the media, I am confident that Eueo 2022 will inspire more women and girls to get into our national game as we work towards parity across all sport. “Despite these positive signs for the game, it is clear that an assessment of the value of the women’s and girl’s game is needed, to ensure it is properly financed for the long-term. The time is right for a thorough review of the women’s game to ensure all is being done to support its further growth.” The Football Association welcomed the move. An FA spokesperson said: “A review of women’s football was a key outcome of the Fan-Led Review and one that we fully support. We have been working with the government for some time on all of the recommendations from the Review and in particular on the proposals to look into the future of women’s football. “This new review will support the continued growth and development in women’s and girls’ football, and it will also help to create a great legacy following what promises to be a fantastic summer of women’s football as we host the Uefa Euro 2022 tournament.”",Sport/Football,UK government to launch in-depth review of women’s football in summer,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/24/uk-government-to-launch-in-depth-review-of-womens-football-in-summer

4/24/2022,"Tyson Fury retained his WBC world heavyweight title by stopping Dillian Whyte brutally and clinically near the end of the sixth round on Saturday night at Wembley Stadium. After a cagey and often ugly bout, which Fury controlled even though both fighters were warned by the referee for some roughhouse brawling, the champion brought the fight to a shuddering conclusion. He snapped out another left jab and then, with Whyte suddenly open and vulnerable, Fury uncorked a vicious right uppercut. It was a devastating punch, reminiscent of the chilling uppercut that Alexander Povetkin used to knock out Whyte in August 2020. But this time Whyte was not rendered unconscious despite losing a tooth and his bearings. He staggered to his feet but, trying to walk towards the referee, Mark Lyson, he weaved and stumbled. Lyson had no option but to wave the fight over because Whyte had clearly been separated from his senses. Whyte came out boxing as a southpaw but Fury remained watchful, preferring to land the occasional jab and sharp combination. The challenger tried to jab often to Fury’s relatively fleshy body but the difference in class was apparent. Fury also switched back and forth from southpaw to his more usual orthodox style. Whyte threw some big punches, but few of them came close to landing, and he seemed intent on turning the fight into a brawl. At the end of the third, as Vaseline was smeared across his face, Whyte already looked to be breathing hard in his corner. Fury, meanwhile, was calm and composed as he listened to instructions from his trainer, Sugarhill Steward. Both fighters were warned in the fourth after a clash of heads which opened up a small cut over Whyte’s right eye. Lyson brought them to the centre of the ring at the start of round five to tell them bluntly that they needed to avoid any foul tactics. Each man landed a thudding body punch but the greater precision of Fury’s work, behind his jab and combinations, was obvious. And then, late in the sixth, Whyte’s hopes were obliterated. The champion’s superior skill, sheer size and punching power were too much for him. Fury has never lost in a long career that began in December 2008 and this was his 33rd professional fight. At six feet nine he is five inches taller than Whyte and he has an even greater seven inch reach advantage. He also has fast feet, sheer ringcraft and a finisher’s instinct which overwhelmed Whyte on a crushing night for the Jamaican-born Londoner. Steward and Andy Lee, who is one of the most impressive young trainers in Britain and Ireland, have had a profound impact in Fury’s corner. In the last two years they have turned Fury into a much more effective and concussive puncher. This latest knockout came straight from the savage heart of the Kronk gym in Detroit where Sugarhill and Lee had spent so many years together under the inspirational tutelage of the great Emanuel Steward. Knockouts always mattered at the Kronk – and they now matter and even define Fury as the best heavyweight in the world. Whyte had tried to unsettle Fury, who is the master of boxing mind-games, by remaining quiet and elusive throughout the protracted fight build-up. While he was furious with the way his cut of the £41,025,000 purse had been reduced to 20%, Whyte hoped to disrupt Fury by refusing to engage with him before the bout. But a decent idea, because Fury is so adept at needling his opponents, proved of limited use at a crammed Wembley where the vast majority of the 94,000 crowd supported the lauded Gypsy King. Whyte accepted his role of underdog with apparent relish but it carried little relevance once Fury took charge and carved out the fight’s violent conclusion. The other slim hope harboured by Whyte’s outnumbered supporters was that Fury would be affected adversely by questions surrounding his previous association with the alleged criminal gang leader Daniel Kinahan. Fury had been rattled a few times during the week, when pressed to explain their past relationship, but the 33-year-old is always most at home in the ring. He showed yet again, while dispatching Whyte, that he almost always has the right answers between the ropes. Fury has promised that this bout against Whyte will be his very last. Maybe he will surprise us yet again by sticking to his word and settle into undefeated retirement but he will surely be tempted to box on and meet the IBF, WBA and WBO champion Olekasndr Usyk in a unification contest. Fury, a fighting man from the top of his gleaming shaven head to the bottom of his huge red boxing boots, is unlikely to disappoint those who would like to see him in the ring a few more times. His decisive victory late on Saturday night ensured that the colourful reign of the Gypsy King will roll on for a little while longer.",Sport/Sport,Tyson Fury stops Dillian Whyte to retain his WBC world heavyweight title,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/23/tyson-fury-stops-dillian-whyte-to-retain-his-wbc-heavyweight-title
