12/12/2021,"UPDATED 12/11, 9:18 p.m. ET: Footage of a more recent alleged sighting has now started gaining traction, including via a TMZ story on Saturday. The footage in question captures a separate reported sighting of unidentified aerial phenomena, this time in the Chino Hills region of California. According to the report, the footage was shot on Dec. 9 and shows multiple unexplained light shapes moving in an erratic fashion. Per the woman responsible for the footage, the lights were first spotted by her grandson, who was taking out the trash at the time. See the video below. See original story below. A new video circulating on social media has fueled the extraterrestrial debate. The footage was reportedly captured by a pilot who was flying over the South China Sea at an altitude of 39,000 feet. The video shows three sets of mysterious light formations moving through the clouds near Hong Kong before quickly disappearing. “I don’t know what that is. That is some weird shit,” a person is heard saying in the video, before the lights seemingly vanish one by one. “Gone.” Though the lights don’t appear to be from any known aircraft, some social media users suspected they were either reflections from the cockpit glass or military flares. Chris Spitzer, who describes himself as an experienced atmospheric phenomena investigator, proposed the latter theory. According to the Independent, the 53-second video was uploaded to a UFO tracking website earlier this month, but was reportedly filmed on Nov. 24—the same day the U.S. Defense Department announced the establishment of a UFO task force. “The (Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group) will synchronize efforts across the Department and the broader U.S. government to detect, identify and attribute objects of interests in Special Use Airspace (SUA), and to assess and mitigate any associated threats to safety of flight and national security,” the DOD wrote in a press release. “To provide oversight of the AOIMSG, the Deputy Secretary also directed the USD(I&S) to lead an Airborne Object Identification and Management Executive Council (AOIMEXEC) to be comprised of DoD and Intelligence Community membership, and to offer a venue for U.S. government interagency representation.” Is This Video of a UFO Sighting in Brooklyn?

12/12/2021,"By David Ljunggren OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada dramatically hardened its tone with Washington in a dispute over proposed U.S. credits for electric vehicles on Friday, threatening to slap tariffs on a range of American goods unless the matter was resolved. In a letter to senior members of the U.S. Senate, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland and Trade Minister Mary Ng also said Canada was ready to launch a dispute settlement process under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade deal. Canada fears the tax credit for American manufacturers will undermine its own efforts to produce electric vehicles in Ontario - the country's industrial heartland - and also undermine the integrated North American auto industry. ""We are writing to register our objection in the strongest terms,"" said the letter, which emphasized that the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did not want a confrontation. If the matter was not resolved ""Canada will have no choice but to forcefully respond by ... applying tariffs on American exports in a manner that will impact American workers in the auto sector and several other sectors of the U.S. economy,"" the two ministers continued. In previous trade disputes between the two close neighbors and trading partners, both sides have slapped sanctions against a wide range of goods. Ottawa is preparing to publish a list of U.S. products that may face Canadian tariffs, Freeland and Ng said, adding that Canada might also suspend dairy quotas for U.S. producers it agreed to under the USMCA, the letter said. Months of lobbying has done little to dissuade U.S. legislators, who are considering a new $12,500 tax credit that would include $4,500 for union-made U.S. electric vehicles. In the letter, Freeland and Ng said the proposal was equivalent to a 34% tariff on Canadian-assembled electric vehicles and represented a significant threat. The White House says President Joe Biden considers the tax credits a personal priority and that the administration does not view them as a violation of the USMCA. Officials have said they hope to work to resolve the dispute with both Canada and Mexico, which also opposes the credit proposal. As recently as last Friday, Ng had said Canada still had some room for maneuvering before the U.S. Senate voted. Asked why Canada had hardened its tone, Ng spokeswoman Alice Hansen said: ""We have always made clear we will stand up for the Canadian auto industry. This is the next step.""
