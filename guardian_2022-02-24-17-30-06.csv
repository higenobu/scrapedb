2/24/2022,"Bonuses are back for Lloyds bankers, after annual profits jumped more than fivefold last year. The banking group said it was reintroducing bonuses for staff with a pool worth £399m, having scrapped payouts due to the impact of the pandemic a year earlier.  The decision reflected the stronger economic outlook and the bank’s higher profits, Lloyds said. It also confirmed that higher bonuses would be handed to staff who deal with customers. The bank posted a £1.3bn charge linked to dealing with previous misdeeds, which covered £790m related to the HBOS Reading controversy, which saw business customers pushed into distress or failure after they were loaded with unmanageable debts and fees between 2003 and 2007. Lloyds said “significant uncertainties remain” and that it continued to support a dual set of reviews , including into how customers were treated and compensated by the bank. “We continue to support the independent Foskett Panel re-review and Dame Linda Dobbs’ independent review process as we work to bring this matter to a conclusion,” Lloyds said. But the group, which owns Halifax and is the UK’s largest mortgage lender, still reported annual profits of £6.9bn, significantly higher than the £1.2bn reported for 2020. While the increase was partially due to higher income, the biggest impact came from the reversal of loan loss charges throughout the year. Lloyds also released a total of £1.2bn worth of loan loss charges throughout 2021. That is compared with the £4.2bn it had been forced to put aside in order to offset a potential jump in loan defaults during the pandemic. Commenting on the results, chief executive Charlie Nunn said: “2021 has been a year of solid financial performance with successful strategic execution, ongoing investment and continued franchise growth.” The bank also boosted shareholder payouts, announcing a dividend of 1.33 pence per share, bringing the total ordinary dividend for the year to 2p per share. It also announced a share buyback programme worth £2bn.",News/Business,Bonuses return at Lloyds as profits surge fivefold to £6.9bn ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/24/bonuses-return-at-lloyds-as-profits-surge-fivefold-to-69bn
2/24/2022,"A barista course aimed at people with disability that allegedly lacked basic equipment and had no specific training manuals was established using a $300,000 federal government grant, an inquiry has heard. Guardian Australia reported on Wednesday that the Busy Beans program, run by disability employment services provider AimBig, was facing claims aired at the disability royal commission that it had “no established policies, procedures, safety measures or proper facilities to train the participants”.  The program is the main case study of three-day hearings this week examining the troubled $1bn-a-year disability employment services program. The royal commission heard on Thursday that on top of $874,000 in government payments for putting jobseekers through the training, the program was also funded using a grant from the National Disability Insurance Agency worth “in excess of $300,000”. Guardian Australia can reveal grant documents show $313,769.50 was awarded in 2019 to Rehab Management, which shares a holding company with AimBig. Under the Busy Beans model, people with disability – who were either paid in part using about $100,000 in government wage subsidies or were unpaid interns – learned to make coffee by serving as in-house baristas for workers at AimBig and Rehab Management offices or other external businesses. People on the autism spectrum or with “moderate intellectual disabilities” were to “receive barista, job readiness and customer service training delivered by qualified barista trainers at ‘coffee schools’ across Australia”. An AimBig manager, Matthew Ting, who was responsible for introducing the Busy Beans program, was asked about photos from one of the several “coffee schools” run out of a Rehab Management office. The photos showed the site of a Rehab Management office with two “home”-style coffee machines laid on office desks in the corner of an office floor. “It boggles my mind why that was set up like that and who did that,” he said. “I don’t understand a reason for that.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Mzia*, a woman with ADHD who was employed as a Busy Beans barista trainer, claimed on Wednesday that she arrived on her first day to find there was not even a coffee jug, or “proper milks”. Trainees had to carry a bucket of hot water across the office to the kitchenette because there was no sink near the “barista training” area, the inquiry was told. Ting said he had never visited the site where Mzia had worked and described the environment as “not at all suitable”. Ting claimed Mzia was “responsible” for the coffee school set-up, though he acknowledged responsibility also lay with her managers. The inquiry heard on Wednesday that Mzia, who told the inquiry she had been employed as a barista trainer but then required to set up a program from “scratch”, had complained about the set-up and lack of equipment to her superiors. Ting said looking at the site as it was in “June 2019, gave a wrong impression in my view of what the program was”. Ting provided other photos to the royal commission of another barista training at an external employer which he said showed a “very, very different environment”, suggesting the program had improved over time.

The inquiry also heard that between March and November 2019, there were no specific training materials for the Busy Beans program. “How is it possible to construct a training program without documentation that explains what’s to be conveyed to the people who are being trained?” the chair, Ronald Sackville, asked. Ting said the course was supposed to be “hands-on” and “definitely not accredited training”, which was “what was needed for these participants”. The inquiry heard on Wednesday that Mzia had been frustrated about the lack of direction for the program and created her own training documents. These were adopted in November 2019, before Busy Beans was suspended in March 2020 due to Covid. The counsel assisting the royal commission, Cathy Dowsett, put it to Ting that Rehab Management sought to exit participants from Busy Beans after 26 weeks. A 26-week “outcome” triggers a substantial government payment to a disability employment services provider. Ting denied the claims. “We did continue to give them rostered shifts after the 26 weeks, so I think the argument that it was 26 weeks and you’re on the street is not quite accurate,” he said. A web page promoting the Busy Beans program on the NDIS website was no longer accessible on Thursday. Last year, Guardian Australia revealed a damning consultants’ report that discovered myriad problems with the disability employment services program. The chief executive of the holding company for AimBig and Rehab Management, Arriba Group, Marcella Romero, will give evidence on Friday. A national disability insurance agency spokesperson said: “In October 2020, administration for the grants component of the ILC building program transitioned from the National Disability Insurance Agency to the Department of Social Services.” The Department of Social Services was approached for comment. The inquiry continues. *Mzia is a pseudonym provided by the royal commission",News/Australia news,"Barista course lacking basic equipment set up with $300,000 federal grant, disability inquiry hears",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/24/barista-course-lacking-basic-equipment-set-up-with-300000-federal-grant-disability-inquiry-hears
2/24/2022,"Scientists working with one of the world’s largest climate research publishers say they’re increasingly alarmed that the company consults with the fossil fuel industry to help increase oil and gas drilling, the Guardian can reveal. Elsevier, a Dutch company behind many renowned peer-reviewed scientific journals, including The Lancet and Global Environmental Change, is also one of the top publishers of books aimed at expanding fossil fuel production.  For more than a decade, the company has supported the energy industry’s efforts to optimize oil and gas extraction. It commissions authors, editors, and journal advisory board members who are current employees at top oil firms. Elsevier also markets some of its research portals and data services directly to the oil and gas industry to help “increase the odds of exploration success”. Several former and current employees say that for the past year, dozens of workers have spoken out internally and at company-wide town halls to urge Elsevier to reconsider its relationship with the fossil fuel industry. “When I first started, I heard a lot about the company’s climate commitments,” said a former Elsevier journal editor who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity. “Eventually I just realized it was all marketing, which is really upsetting because Elsevier has published all the research it needs to know exactly what to do if it wants to make a meaningful difference.” What makes Elsevier’s ties to the fossil fuel industry particularly alarming to its critics is that it is one of a handful of companies that publish peer-reviewed climate research. Scientists and academics say they’re concerned that Elsevier’s conflicting business interests risk undermining their work. Julia Steinberger, a social ecologist and ecological economist at the Université de Lausanne who has published studies in several Elsevier journals, said she was shocked to hear that the company took an active role in expanding fossil fuel extraction. “Elsevier is the publisher of some of the most important journals in the environmental space,” she said. “They cannot claim ignorance of the facts of climate change and the urgent necessity to move away from fossil fuels.” She added: “Their business model seems to be to profit from publishing climate and energy science, while disregarding the most basic fact of climate action: the urgent need to move away from fossil fuels.” Elsevier and its parent company, RELX, say they are committed to supporting the fossil fuel industry as it transitions toward clean energy. And while Elsevier has emerged as an industry leader with its own climate pledges, a spokesperson for the company said they are not prepared to draw a line between the transition away from fossil fuels and the expansion of oil and gas extraction. She voiced concern about publishers boycotting or “canceling” oil and gas firms. “We recognize that we are imperfect and we have to do more, but that shouldn’t negate all of the amazing work we have done over the past 15 years,” Márcia Balisciano, founding global head of corporate responsibility at RELX, told The Guardian. Of the more than 2,000 scholarly journals that Elsevier publishes, only seven are specific to fossil fuel extraction (14 if you count special publications and subsidiaries). Those journals include Upstream Oil and Gas Technology, the editor-in-chief of which works for Shell, and Unconventional Resources, which is edited by a Chevron researcher. It also runs a subsidiary book publisher, Gulf Publishing, which includes titles such as The Shale Oil and Gas Handbook and Strategies for Optimizing Petroleum Exploration. Elsevier also provides consultancy services to corporate clients. For the past 12 years, it has marketed a tool called Geofacets to fossil fuel companies. Geofacets combines thousands of maps and studies to make it easier to find and access oil and gas reserves, in addition to locations for wind farms or carbon storage facilities. The company claims the tool cuts research time by 50% and helps identify “riskier, more remote areas that had previously been inaccessible.”  Top climate scientists, including those published in Elsevier’s own journals, however, say just the opposite must happen in order to avert a climate catastrophe. Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius or less requires a worldwide decrease in fossil fuel production with over 80 percent of all proven reserves being left in the ground. “We will not comment on the practices of individual companies, but any actions actively supporting the expansion of fossil fuel development are indeed inconsistent” with the United Nations’ sustainable development goals, said Sherri Aldis, acting deputy director for the UN department of global communications. RELX is an astoundingly profitable company, with annual revenues topping $9.8bn, about a third of which are brought in by Elsevier. Balisciano emphasizes that fossil fuel content represents less than 1 percent of Elsevier’s publishing revenue, and less than half of Geofacets’ revenue, which itself only represents around 2 percent of Elsevier’s earnings. RELX and Elsevier say the bulk of their work supports and enables an energy transition via publications centered on clean energy. “We don’t want to draw a binary and we don’t think you can just flip a switch, but we have been reducing our involvement with fossil fuel activities while increasing the amount of research we publish on climate and clean energy,” said Esra Erkal, executive vice president of communications at Elsevier. Elsevier is not alone in navigating relationships with both climate researchers and fossil fuel executives. Multiple other publishers of peer-reviewed climate research have signed on to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals Publishers Compact while also partnering with the oil and gas industry in various ways. The UK-based publisher Taylor & Francis, for example, signed the UN pledge and released its own net-zero commitments while also touting its publishing partnership with “industry leader” ExxonMobil, the oil company most linked to obstructionism on climate in the public consciousness. Another top climate publisher, Wiley, is also signed onto the sustainability compact while publishing multiple books and journals aimed at helping the industry find and drill for more oil and gas. “It’s problematic,” said Dr. Kimberly Nicholas, associate professor of sustainability science at Lund University in Sweden, noting that while corporate greenwashing is rampant across multiple industries, the publishers of peer-reviewed climate research have a unique responsibility. “If the same publisher putting out the papers that show definitively we can’t burn any more fossil fuels and stay within this carbon budget is also helping the fossil fuel industry do just that, what does that do to the whole premise of validity around the climate research? That is what’s deeply concerning about these conflicts,” she said. Ben Franta, a researcher at Stanford University who has also published studies in Elsevier journals, notes that the publisher’s relationship with oil firms is indicative of just how entwined that industry is with so many other aspects of society. “This all happens without the broader public knowing, and it operates to entrench the industry,” he said. “To effect a rapid replacement of fossil fuels, I believe these entanglements will need to be exposed and reformed.” Elsevier, for its part, emphasizes the role of editorial independence. “We wouldn’t want to tell journal editors what they can and can’t publish,” Balisciano said. However, such conflicts often place researchers in a tough position to navigate. James Dyke, assistant director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter, was surprised that Elsevier would be working to contradict climate researchers in this way. “It’s hard to believe that a company that publishes research about the dangers of the climate and ecological crises is the very same company that actively works with oil and gas companies to extract more fossil fuels, which drags us towards disaster,” he said.",News/Environment,Revealed: leading climate research publisher helps fuel oil and gas drilling,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/24/elsevier-publishing-climate-science-fossil-fuels
2/24/2022,"Boris Johnson has pledged that the UK and its allies will respond “decisively” to Russia’s attack on Ukraine as he prepared to chair a Cobra emergency meeting on the crisis with further economic sanctions expected to be under consideration. The prime minister also condemned Vladimir Putin, saying Russia’s president had “chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction”.  It came as Ukraine’s president declared martial law, while Russia’s military said it had targeted Ukrainian airbases and other military assets and had not targeted populated areas. A Downing Street spokesperson said Johnson will chair a Cobra committee meeting at 7.30am to discuss the response to the “horrific attacks”. Britain, in common with other Nato allies, has said it would not fight Russia, because Ukraine is not a Nato member. But the UK has supplied arms to Kyiv and is has already announce limited economic sanctions. In a statement posted on Twitter at 4.53am, Johnson said he had spoken with the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to discuss “next steps”. He said: “I am appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and I have spoken to President Zelenskiy to discuss next steps. President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine. The UK and our allies will respond decisively.” I am appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and I have spoken to President Zelenskyy to discuss next steps.President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine.The UK and our allies will respond decisively. A Downing Street spokesperson said Johnson had assured Zelenskiy the west “would not stand by as President Putin waged his campaign against the Ukrainian people”. “The prime minister said he hoped Ukraine could resist and that Ukraine and its people were in the thoughts of everyone in the United Kingdom people during this dark time,” the spokesperson said. Britain, in common with other Nato allies, has said it would not fight Russia, because Ukraine is not a Nato member. But the UK has supplied arms to Kyiv and is expected to announce further economic sanctions. Britain’s ambassador to Ukraine urged UK nationals to leave Ukraine immediately. Melinda Simmons wrote on Twitter: “We advise GB nationals to leave Ukraine immediately if you judge that it is safe to do so from your location. Please call +380 44 490 3660 if you need assistance.” Putin announced the action during a televised address early on Thursday morning, saying the move was a response to threats from Ukraine. He said Russia does not have a goal to occupy Ukraine, but the responsibility for bloodshed lies with the Ukrainian “regime”. He also warned other countries that any attempt to interfere with the Russian action would lead to “consequences they have never seen”. Putin accused the US and its allies of ignoring Russia’s demand to prevent Ukraine from joining Nato and offer Moscow security guarantees. He said the Russian military operation aims to ensure a “demilitarisation” of Ukraine, adding that all Ukrainian servicemen who lay down arms will be able to safely leave the zone of combat. The UK’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, described Russia’s actions as “naked aggression against a democratic country” and said no one had been fooled by the Kremlin’s “false flags and fake narratives”. “The Russian Federation has today further violated Ukrainian sovereignty,” he said. “Despite the efforts of the international communities, Russia has chosen conflict. No one has been fooled by the Kremlin’s false flags and fake narratives. “This is naked aggression against a democratic country which had dared to express a different aspiration than being a supine neighbour to Russia. No one should forget this day.

2/24/2022,"Imagine tasting a full English breakfast whenever you heard the words “Tottenham Court Road”. Or the flavour of pineapple chunks at the tinkling of a piano. For James, who is a synaesthete and one of the extraordinary people described in Guy Leschziner’s new book, words, music and life itself are saturated with striking taste sensations. Leschziner, a professor of neurology at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital, has brought together a collection of exceptionally unusual and interesting stories in his second book, dedicated to the wonder of our senses. Among his astonishing tales of what happens when the processing of sensory inputs goes wrong, Leschziner includes crystal-clear explanations of something no less amazing – how our senses operate normally. We meet a cast of people whose lives changed when the senses they took for granted suddenly shifted: Valeria the sommelier who lost her sense of taste; Oliver the film-maker who only discovered in his mid-20s that he was missing a chunk of his visual field; and Mark, a man who can hear his own eyeballs “moving and squelching”. Bill Oddie makes a charming if unexpected appearance at one point, discussing his hearing loss-related auditory hallucinations, which sound like a brass band playing nearby.  As well as the Big Five – sight, smell, taste, hearing and touch – Leschziner introduces us to people with neurological differences in less obvious modalities. His first patient, Paul, has a genetic disorder that means he cannot feel pain. Far from being a blessing, this causes him to suffer constant ruinous injuries. Rachel experiences the impairment of something most people wouldn’t even consider a sense at all: proprioception, the awareness of where our bodies and their various parts are in space, is critical to our everyday functioning. She struggles with door handles, or lifting a cup to her lips. Almost all the people in Leschziner’s collection of cases have suffered catastrophic losses, and yet they show stunning resilience. Their stories are jaw-dropping, but this is not misery porn. Refreshingly, one never has the sense that Leschziner is wringing out his patients’ lives for dramatic effect. His prose is straightforward, and it lacks the whiff of narcissism or martyrdom that can emerge when doctors write books for a popular audience. For all his professional expertise, the moments when Leschziner lets himself get personal or make a gentle, avuncular quip are where his warmth and empathy show, making a book that could otherwise be hard-going a delightful read. At one point, he imagines what it would be like to be a maggot or a dung beetle. He reminisces about the fragrance of sun-warmed pebbles in kindergarten. In the middle of the book – not quite out of nowhere, as he is circuitously talking about our sense of taste – are three delicious pages of lyrical culinary descriptions of the cuisine of his dual Baghdadi-Jewish and Ashkenazi heritage and a dip into his fascinating family history. Tantalisingly, Leschziner leaves any serious consideration of the major philosophical implications of our imperfect senses – which he describes as “like trying to stream an HD movie over a slow internet connection” – until the epilogue. At this point, having introduced heavyweights such as Cartesian mind-body duality and the notion that our reality is merely a controlled hallucination, he taps out of the ring, stating: “I make no pretence at being a philosopher.” Yet Leschziner’s existential insights are exactly what I want to hear more of at the end of this intriguing book. Instead, he leaves the reader hankering for more, with a renewed sense of awe at the delicate, magnificent workings of the senses.

2/24/2022,"Former New South Wales deputy premier John Barilaro has started working with Sydney property developer Coronation Properties, just weeks after leaving parliament. The company, which said it had $1.4bn worth of projects under way, and a further $5bn in the pipeline, will employ Barilaro as its executive director.  The appointment was revealed after the NSW parliament’s ethics adviser, John Evans, tabled his advice on the appointment to parliament on Thursday. The letter said Barilaro had advised the office that he had accepted the role of executive director with “responsibilities across all aspects of the business”. Barilaro also advised that “there may be some level of engagement with both state and local government” in the role. Although Coronation mostly does work in the private sector, Evans said the company has some unspecified work from the state government. Parliamentarians must seek advice if they intend to undertake employment within 18 months of leaving office. Evans has approved Barilaro taking the job but imposed conditions that he must not use information acquired in the course of being a minister or through his attendance at cabinet. Barilaro is also barred from communicating any of that information to a third party for financial gain. A further condition has been imposed that for 18 months from his last day in ministerial office, Barilaro “should not become personally involved in lobbying government officials, on behalf of Coronation in relation to [his] portfolio responsibilities held during the last two years of ministerial office”. Barilaro’s new job follows news that former premier Gladys Berejiklian has taken an executive position with telecommunications company Optus. However unlike telecommunications, which is regulated by the federal government, regulation of property development is entirely the province of the state and local government. The involvement of the state government extends beyond policy matters to decisions on zonings and approvals of major projects, though some of the more contentious approvals are now sent to the Independent Planning Commission for assessments which are made public. This followed a decade of scandals under the previous Labor government over the state government “calling in” projects where they hit resistance from local communities and pushing them through. Donation laws were also overhauled after concerns were raised about the influence of donors in the property industry on state government decisions. The state government is also a major property owner in the state. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Coronation’s current developments include a terrace house development in Ashbury, a $52m apartment block in the CBD of Parramatta and a 973 unit development over five buildings in Merrylands. Coronation recently also completed the redevelopment of the old paper mill site on the Georges River at Liverpool. It includes retail areas and 245 apartments. The development of Liverpool took off after the state government lifted the height restrictions in the area in 2015, allowing for a major transformation of the centre. Coronation Property is owned by John Landerer, a well-known lawyer and Sydney businessman, and Joe Nahas, who has been in the property industry for 20 years. Last week Landerer sold his Vaucluse mansion for a reported $62m, making it the sixth most expensive sale in the country.
