2/22/2022,"Following the critically acclaimed Dearest Sister, Laos’s first female director, Mattie Do, has crafted another enigmatic tale that sets itself apart from the usual horror fare, offering plenty of genre pleasures while retaining an arthouse aesthetic. In an impoverished Laotian village, an unnamed farmer (Yannawoutthi Chanthalungsy) leads a near-hermit-like existence. His daily rituals involve scavenging for metal scraps, which he sells for little money. His reticent demeanour, however, betrays none of his discontent. Yet, just as secrets lie beneath the landscape, he has skeletons in his closet. He is haunted by his mother’s death from severe lung disease, and while people whisper about his ability to speak to the dead, no one knows that, since his childhood encounter with a ghost, he has taken it upon himself to relieve dying women of their suffering by euthanising them. As their apparitions wander for eternity, these spectres embody his own inability to break free of the past.  The film takes place in a near future where the government injects everyone with a surveillance chip, but the otherworldly plot is grounded by exacting characterisation. Chanthalungsy is astounding in his portrayal of a man so consumed with regret that his humanity slowly shreds away. Enthralled by his new ability to travel back in time to influence the course of his mother’s passage into the next life, he is blind to how his interventions result in frightening consequences. Blurring the line between good intentions and selfishness, The Long Walk is a chilling and wholly original exploration of destructive human desires.  The Long Walk is released on 28 February on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,The Long Walk review – inventive Laotian horror of ghosts and time travel,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/21/the-long-walk-review-inventive-laotian-horror-of-ghosts-and-time-travel
2/22/2022,"In just six days the UK has been battered by a triple whammy of Dudley, Eunice and Franklin and next up could be Gladys. But does the naming of storms heighten awareness to the danger, or inure us? Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society, says that it does work and heightens awareness. “Having named storms gives them a kind of uniqueness, identity and higher profile … that need for people to listen and take action.”  The naming of storms in the UK and Ireland is a recent phenomenon, although it has been used around the world for decades. But in 2015 the UK Met Office and Ireland’s Met Éireann launched the Name our Storms project to improve communication of high-impact weather events. The public are invited to suggest names for the storms and a list of alternate male and female names is issued in September. Last year it began with Arwen and if there is a storm later this week it will be Gladys. Future names include Imani, Nasim, Ruby and Tineke. The naming of storms comes on top of the system in which the Met Office issues yellow, amber and rare red warnings. Bentley accepted that having so many weather warnings could inure people to their danger. “I’ve heard people say: ‘We always have warnings and people become blase about them.’ But they are there for a reason.” People will only become blase, Bentley believes, if they stop believing them. “The worst thing that could happen is that we push out lots of these warnings and then nothing happens. There’s that feeling of we’re crying wolf.” She said the Met Office had done an impressive job in naming Eunice last Monday. “To get that message out five days in advance is pretty good going.” Named storm warnings work, said Bentley, pointing to the 22 lives lost in the “great storm” of 1987, which came through when most people were asleep. Eunice was during the day and three people in the UK were killed. “Any loss of life is terrible but it could have been an awful lot worse.” The pioneer of storm naming as we know it was a meteorologist called Clement Wragge, who worked for the Queensland government between 1887 and 1907. It was adopted by US navy and air force meteorologists during the second world war for the naming of tropical cyclones and became common practice in the US and Australia from the 1950s. Andrew Charlton-Perez, professor of meteorology at Reading University, was part of a team that explored the impact of naming storms by looking at Storm Doris, which took place in 2017, and how information flowed. “You can definitely see very large spikes in attention around that term a couple of days before the event, there really is communication going on.” Naming Storm Eunice so far in advance “really did change behaviour”, he said. “Both the warnings and storm naming is all about changing behaviour and making sure that people don’t put themselves at risk so I think yes absolutely, that worked in this case.” He praised the Met Office for making the right calls at the right time, meaning people took note. “You can end up with doing this too much and people get inured to it.” So far, that was not happening, he said.",News/UK news,"Naming storms has been success, say UK meteorologists",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/21/naming-storms-has-been-success-say-uk-meteorologists
2/22/2022,"The University of Oxford accepted at least £1.6m from oil, gas and petrochemical companies in 2020-21 despite its 2035 net zero commitment, according to a report by students. The funding was in addition to the more than £11m Oxford received from fossil fuel donors between 2015 and 2020.  The research was based on a freedom of information request filed in October by the student-run Oxford Climate Justice Campaign (OCJC). It revealed that four firms, Eni, Mitsubishi, BP and Shell, had all given donations and research funding to the university totalling between £1.6m-£1.7m from 1 August 2020 to 31 July 2021. This included £208,700 for research funding from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and £58,600 for research funding and donations from Shell, according to the report. The largest contribution however, came from the Italian oil group Eni. It gave more than £1.3m to the Saïd Business School, according to the FOI. Of this, it appears that £769,500 funded Eni scholarships and the remaining £571,000 supported the school’s Centre for Corporate Reputation. The report describe this as “another case of corporate greenwashing”. The figures do not include the £100m that the petrochemical group Ineos donated to create a new institute to study antimicrobial resistance. The researchers noted the continued presence of positions and institutions named after or dedicated to fossil fuel donors including Eni-Oxford Africa scholarships, the Exxon-Mobil scholarship in global health science. OCJC’s last report also found that the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies was two-thirds funded by the fossil fuel industry. The OCJC member behind the FOI request, Philip Hutchinson, said: “Oxford often tells us that donation money doesn’t influence their research. But how can the Saïd Business School provide talks and advice on climate policy while at the same time taking money from major fossil fuel producers? It doesn’t take a genius to see that if you’re taking so much money, millions every year, this will influence what advice you’re giving to leaders.” He added: “This is especially true for the Centre for Corporate Reputation. If you’re playing a role in deciding what is acceptable for corporations to do, this money creates a huge conflict of interest which really questions whether the Saïd Business School can actually give honest advice on these issues.” According to the report, Oxford disclosed it had received between £20,000-£98,000 from BP in 2020-21, saying that revealing the exact amount of money donated would “undermine its ability to secure future research funding from this source”, which is a valid exemption under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. “I think that’s an inappropriate use of section 43 of the FOI act,” Hutchinson added. “It’s simply untrue to state this will damage BP’s commercial interests when information about BP’s ties to Oxford University has been out for years. Why would it only damage their commercial interests now?” Cambridge, in contrast, publicly report the exact amount of money every company, not just fossil fuel companies, provides in research grants to the university every year. An Oxford spokesperson said: “The University of Oxford safeguards the independence of its teaching and research regardless of the nature of their funding. Those donating money to the university have no influence over how academics carry out their research or what conclusions they reach. Researchers publish the results of their work whether the results are seen to be critical or favourable by industry or governments. “Our research with different industries allows the university to apply its knowledge to real challenges of pressing global concern, with funding often going directly into research into climate-related issues and renewables. None of the philanthropic funding highlighted [by this report] has gone into extraction and exploration research but has been used to widen access to education, to fund scholarships, academic posts, and capital costs.” ",News/Education,Oxford University took at least £1.6m last year from fossil fuel firms,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/21/oxford-university-took-at-least-pounds-16m-last-year-from-fossil-fuel-firms
2/22/2022,"In a 19-minute long sit-down with The Athletic last August, the only time Jack Wilshere came close to cracking anything resembling a smile was when he struggled to remember the identities of his close friends in football. Without a club after being released by Bournemouth, the sight of the one-time Arsenal and England superstar revealing how difficult it was to explain to his eldest child that no club anywhere wanted him, while candidly discussing the fact that his two youngest had never seen him play football and probably don’t know what he “does” was enough to bring a tear to a glass eye.  It was certainly a far cry from the cock-a-hoop Jack the Lad who got himself in bother eight years ago for singing anti-Tottenham songs while wearing shades and a bucket hat during the celebrations that followed Arsenal’s 2014 FA Cup win. In the last six months, Jack has kept his head down, sometimes training with his former club and often training alone, despite not knowing what exactly it is he’s training for. Aged just 30, Wilshere should be in his playing pomp but not a single club in any of Europe’s top five leagues were prepared to take a punt on him. His reputation for having ankles made from biscuits doesn’t so much precede him as march in front of him loudly banging a giant drum while shouting “ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO THINK OF SIGNING JACK!” One suspects that if somebody had arrived from the future in a time-travelling DeLorean to tell 2015 Jack that in seven-and-a-half years he’d be signing for Danish side Aarhus, he’d have laughed and presumed they’d mistaken him for Nicklas Bendtner. But it is off to mid-table Superliga side Aarhus that Jack is headed, in the hope of staying fit enough to prove there’s life in the old dog yet. “I am very grateful for the opportunity AGF has offered me and I will do everything I can to help the team move forward,” said Wilshere, to his children, Aarhus fans and the wider public in general. “I am very much looking forward to contributing to the team.” And while his first move abroad may not be among those he envisaged as a young player with the world at his feet, one of football’s weirdly forgotten and unwanted men has at least secured himself something he openly admits he hasn’t had for some time: a good reason to get up in the morning. “Each player who has played, and it doesn’t matter what level, has great games and tough games, and [Moore] had a tough day at the office. Obviously, she’s sad and disappointed, but she’s an unbelievable person and player who belongs on this team. We are all behind her in this tough moment” – New Zealand manager Jitka Klimkova offers her support to defender Meikayla Moore, who scored a hat-trick of own goals in 36 minutes before being substituted during the 5-0 defeat by USA.

Pep Guardiola has reminded hacks that he “never said the title race was over” after a weekend in which Spurs (yes, Spurs!) and Liverpool reignited it. Swansea v Bournemouth and Fleetwood v Sheffield Wednesday have been called off after stadium-knack caused by Storm Franklin.

The PFA has called again for the introduction of temporary substitutions for head injuries after Robin Koch was allowed to play on for Leeds against Manchester United. Off the pitch, nine people were arrested “for a number of offences including public order, throwing of missiles and breach of banning order”, according to West Yorkshire Police. England manager Sarina Wiegman praised 21-year-old Hannah Hampton after the debutant goalkeeper kept a clean sheet in the 0-0 draw with a strong Spain team. “She’s a young player, very talented,” she cooed. “She just needs games like this to develop.” And Ben Garuccio had not scored a goal in four years and then he went and did a flamin’ scorpion kick in the flamin’ A-League to backheel himself into Puskás Award contention.
