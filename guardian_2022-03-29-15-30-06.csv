3/29/2022,"Ezra Miller has been arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and harassment after an alleged incident at a Hawaii bar on Sunday evening. Police say the 29-year-old actor, best known for playing DC superhero the Flash and their recurring role in the Harry Potter spin off franchise Fantastic Beasts, was arrested in Hilo on Monday morning. In a public statement, Hawaii police said South Hilo officers had responded to reports of a disorderly bar patron on Sunday just before midnight. Police allege that Miller had become “agitated” while other patrons sang karaoke and began “yelling obscenities”. Police allege the actor then “grabbed the microphone from a 23-year-old woman singing karaoke and later lunged at a 32-year-old man playing darts. The bar owner asked Miller to calm down several times to no avail”. Miller featured briefly in the Academy Awards on Sunday, with a pivotal scene of the Flash in Zack Snyder’s Justice League winning the “most cheer-worthy moment” category, a new award introduced by the Academy that is voted for by audiences at home. Miller was released on bail on Monday police said. Miller’s representatives have not yet responded to requests for comment. Miller is set to appear in the next Fantastic Beasts film, The Secrets of Dumbledore, in April. The Flash, which will see their super fast superhero take the leading role and recently finished production, has been delayed by Warner Brothers until 2023.",Arts/Film,Ezra Miller: Justice League star arrested after allegedly ‘yelling obscenities’ in Hawaii bar,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/29/ezra-miller-justice-league-star-arrested-after-allegedly-yelling-obscenities-in-hawaii-bar
3/29/2022,"Carl Heneghan is an epidemiologist first and foremost, professor of evidence-based medicine at Oxford, probably many other things – good citizen, well-liked family member – and then, way down the list, a person on Twitter. In other words he doesn’t create social media storms for fun, nor does he have any track record of contrarianism. So how does such a person get banned, as Heneghan was briefly last week, from a social media platform that, famously, has trouble keeping abreast of racial slurs and death threats? Heneghan published a study that suggested the number of people who had died from Covid may have been exaggerated. His final conclusion was that we still had no idea how many people have died because UK health statistics agencies use inconsistent definitions. This was enough to mark him out, albeit briefly, as a Covid denier, which in turn put him in the same camp as anti-vaxxers. Heneghan is not a sceptic in the style of Lord Sumption, who famously told a woman with stage four cancer that her life was “less valuable”; nor is he a fundamentalist libertarian, opposing lockdown measures on the grounds that nobody’s life is worth more than the hero’s right to go out for a cappuccino. Instead, since the start of the pandemic, Heneghan has – often unfashionably – been centring vulnerable people in public health, taking a gestalt view of health impacts, asking multiple questions at once: what does loneliness do to older people? What does disruption of routine do to the mentally ill? What decisions could a dutiful citizen make to protect others, and could we not find some way to normalise thoughtful and responsible behaviour before we isolate the already isolated? This isn’t really a defence of Heneghan, who is back on Twitter now. Rather, there is a fault in the conception of disinformation and how to prevent its spread. Fake news can’t be combated with blanket rules against anti-vaxxers; it can only be identified by those with a good working knowledge of real news – ideally, those who create real news. We have been trying to separate the business of gathering news from the business of disseminating it all century. It’s time to admit the experiment has failed.  Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist  ",News/Media,How do you stop fake news about Covid?

3/29/2022,"With energy bills on everyone’s mind, those little questions about how to cut your use have come to the fore. We asked experts to answer some FAQs. The million-dollar question. Brian Horne, a senior insight and analytics consultant at the Energy Saving Trust, says a kettle is more efficient than a hob for heating water as it is heated from the inside, whereas the pan is heated from the outside and needs to get warm first. Kettles will boil water faster and use fewer units of energy. But while gas hobs take much longer and use up to three times more energy in unit terms, the consumer group Which? says that because gas is cheaper than electricity (less than a third per unit), it works out slightly cheaper to boil water on a gas hob than using an electric kettle. This assumes you are boiling only the quantity you need, are using a lid and switch off the hob as soon as it has boiled. Yes. British Gas estimates that as much as 23% of our electrical usage, or £200 a year currently, could be put down to what are being termed vampire devices – chargers left plugged in and switched on or items on standby. Hi-fis, televisions, set-top boxes and games consoles that sit on standby are all using power – and the older the device, the greater the standby load. However, it is also the unseen chargers, such as those for electric toothbrushes, razors, etc. “As soon as your device is fully charged, try to get into the habit of unplugging it,” says Marc Robson, a British Gas smart energy expert. “As well as saving energy, this will prolong your battery life. And it could also save you about £60 a year on your electricity bills.” Gas, because the unit price is far less than the unit price of electricity. This is partly offset if you have an induction hob. “If you’re looking to reduce your carbon emissions, consider using an electric or induction hob rather than gas,” Horne says. “Induction hobs are typically the most energy-efficient as no energy is wasted heating space around the pan.” Whichever you use, Robson says you can cut energy use by some careful choices: “Use the right size of saucepan for what you’re cooking and fill it with just enough water. Putting a lid on will save energy and reduce condensation in the kitchen, too.” If you are reheating food, microwaves are more efficient than electric and gas ovens, Horne says. “Comparing a microwave with a hob is trickier, though – the microwave is likely to use the least energy but a gas hob may still be cheaper.” Yes. “Modern washing powders and detergents work effectively at lower temperatures,” Horne says. Brands such as Ariel and Persil advertise that their products work at 30C. None seem to make claims about washes below that. However, Which? says its tests found “cleaning power was slightly worse at 20C compared with 40C” but “switching to a liquid detergent helped, and should still be enough for everyday cleaning”. Just moving the dial down to 30C will make a big difference to the cost of running a washing machine – Horne says it will cut the energy needed by 40%. Robson adds: “Spin your clothes before hanging them out to dry, instead of relying on your tumble dryer.” You will always save money by turning the heating off when you don’t need it, Horne says. It will take extra energy to heat up when you turn it back on but this will always be less than the energy wasted by running the heating when you don’t need to. He says the only exception is if you have a heat pump, as these are more efficient if you leave them running for longer at a lower output. Martyn Bridges, the director of technical support at the boiler maker Worcester Bosch, agrees: “It is generally more economical to turn off your heating system when you are not so much in need of it. For example, through the night or parts of the day when the house is empty.” Traditional lightbulbs and modern LED lights don’t take any extra energy to turn on, so you should always turn them off when you are not using them or when you leave a room, Horne says. He says this could save you about £20 a year. Robson says LEDs are so energy-efficient that it won’t make much difference to your bills if you leave them on for five minutes when you pop out of the room “but we always advise turning them off anyway, so that you get into good habits”. If you do still have any traditional lightbulbs, switching them for LEDs will result in a 69% energy saving. A short(ish) shower. Worcester Bosch’s Bridges says: “A typical bath requires about 90 litres of water, split between 60 litres or so of hot water and 20 to 30 of cold. A normal thermostatic mixer shower head discharges about nine litres a minute, requiring about six litres of hot and three litres of cold. So, providing you shower in less than 10 minutes, it will be more economical to shower.”",Lifestyle/Money,Is it cheaper to have a bath or a shower?

3/29/2022,"A year ago today, Fran Hall drew a small red heart on the wall of the Albert Embankment alongside St Thomas’ hospital and opposite the the Houses of Parliament. Within the heart, she wrote the name Steve Mead, the husband she lost to coronavirus in October 2020 just three weeks after they married. Her tribute heart was among the first of more than 180,000 that have since been painted on what is now known as the national Covid memorial wall, in a 500-metre-long dedication to those who have died as a result of the disease. Recalling the days before she and a small team of volunteers with the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group started to paint hearts on the wall, Hall said that despite being warned her actions could lead to a criminal damage charge and a £10k fine, she signed up. “If we could get some hearts on the wall, quickly, it would be difficult to stop,” she told the Guardian. On 29 March 2021, the day on which the government began to relax the restrictions of the third lockdown, allowing gatherings of up to six people, Hall and the team arrived at the Lambeth Bridge end of the Embankment at about 8am. Passersby would have seen a unit that was professional in appearance, wearing tabards and carrying signs saying “National Covid Memorial Wall”. Hall attributes this strategy to the organisers behind the organisers: Led By Donkeys, the political campaign group famed for its guerrilla stunts, who were discreetly advising Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice. “We were each given a tub of Posca pens, a template of a heart and a section of wall to work on,” she said. “There we were at the wall, painting hearts.” Within a couple of hours, the group had drawn 1,000, and within 10 days, there were more than 150,000, equal to the number of people by that point who had died with Covid-19 on the death certificate. “I was very conscious of the security cameras,” Hall said. “But after the first hours I’d done 25 to 30 hearts. I gradually went faster and faster and so became more confident.” Asked what her husband would have thought, Hall said: “Well, he was a retired police officer from the Met, so he probably wouldn’t have been impressed at me committing criminal damage … but he would have supported this 100% to make sure people aren’t forgotten and the decision makers were held to account.” The memorial, as iconic and powerful as it has now become, nevertheless remains at risk of erasure. Despite the dedication of a team of volunteers who continue to touch up the red hearts and the messages in black pen, the wall is yet to be granted a permanent status and could still be removed. On Tuesday, bereaved families and supporters, including Hall, will be handing a petition with more than 106,000 signatures and counting to 10 Downing Street, calling for the memorial wall to be made permanent. The day will include a silent procession along the length of the wall, as well as a candlelit vigil in the evening. Boris Johnson promised a “commission” on Covid commemoration in May last year, but nothing further has been done, and the prime minister has refused to commit to making the wall permanent. Hall said: “The government must do the right thing and support us in our efforts to have the wall made a permanent memorial, a place of reflection and contemplation and remembrance that will stand as a reminder of the horror and grief so many have endured.” So much has happened since the memorial was created: more than 37,000 people have died within 28 days of a positive test, an average of about 102 a day, according to official figures, with the total for the entire pandemic standing at 164,671. Between the day when the first heart was drawn and July last year, the lockdown restrictions were gradually lifted, permitting larger gatherings, indoor gatherings and the reopening of much-missed sectors of the economy, including pubs and restaurants. Just as the country was starting to feel more confident again, the Omicron wave hit, prompting the government to trigger plan B measures in December, with mask-wearing mandatory once more in many settings and working-from-home guidance reinstated. Those restrictions were later removed, and the government switched to its “living with Covid strategy” last month. However, with the death toll still rising and daily case numbers climbing close to record highs, hearts continue to be added to the wall.",News/World news,Future of Covid memorial wall still uncertain one year after the first heart,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/national-covid-memorial-wall-future-one-year-on
3/29/2022,"Royal tours have long been a central feature of monarchical life. It’s what they do. As the Queen says: “We have to be seen to be believed.” Medieval monarchs toured their realms obsessively in order to show they were still alive. It also helped keep their populations in order and allowed them to display their magnificence and power. Henry II’s legs grew bandy as he rode continuously across France, England and Ireland in the 12th century. Elizabeth I’s tours, 400 years later, wended their way round the country: she spoke to ordinary folk encountered en route and accepted gifts from the burghers of the towns that she and her 300-wagon baggage train passed through. George IV laced himself into tight-fitting corsets and wore flesh-coloured stockings under his kilt on his official visit to Edinburgh in 1822, and Queen Victoria’s coachman drove a press party off the road when they encroached too close to the royal tourists in the Highlands in the 1840s. As Victoria retreated into privacy after Albert’s death – which brought a wave of republicanism in consequence – the future prime minister Lord Salisbury wrote warningly: “Seclusion is one of the few luxuries in which royal personages may not indulge … loyalty needs a life of almost un-intermitted publicity to sustain it.” In the present day, what William and Kate were doing last week on their tour of the Caribbean was exposing themselves to both adulation and scrutiny, just like all their predecessors. When Victoria opened a working men’s college in the East End of London late in 1887 she told the same Lord Salisbury she had been subjected to “a horrid noise, quite new to the Queen’s ears, ‘booing’ she thinks it is called”. Yet that same summer she was greeted by cheering crowds at her golden jubilee celebrations. Nowadays royal tours are almost invariably accompanied by a large cadre of the media, royal correspondents, royal watchers, magazine writers, photographers and camera crews – and that’s just from the UK. Add in the local media (often juiced with a level of snarkiness rarely indulged in by the Brits) and it is often a huge entourage which rarely these days indulges in outright reverence for the royal personages. The media goes on such tours first because there may be some newsworthiness to them, as there turned out to be last week; second, to view the royals at close range in a way that’s not normally possible – to see what they are like in person, maybe even speak to them; and third, to test the water for their popularity. The royals also do the last: the palace is assiduous in discreet polling when planning the trips in great detail, which is one reason why the missteps in the Caribbean were unusual. Newsworthiness is crucial in determining coverage. Royal trips are expensive for media organisations so they need at least the prospect of getting something out of them. One demonstration beats a dozen trips to an organic farm, as Prince Charles has discovered now his tours have waned in popularity: not another bloody rainforest. Too routine, too repetitive, too worthy, too dull. The Camelot fairytale myth can only take you so far: even William, on whom with his wife and children so many hopes of monarchists rest, is not as glamorous as was once made out. “He’s just another middle-aged bald bloke in a suit,” as one cameraman once said to me. The royals also have to play ball: show themselves, make themselves available, give a good photo opportunity to illuminate the day’s events. Charles’s well-known aversion to donning another funny hat presented by the locals and his propensity to turn his back or scowl at photographers has had an effect on his popularity and the coverage of issues he feels strongly about. It may seem trite for the media to behave in this way, but a good photograph or film sequence on the news at least has the possibility of showing the royals both at work and highlighting serious concerns for the few issues they are allowed to talk about. Journalists need staged events on royal tours, which is partly why the unstaged and unexpected enliven the day. After long hours spent corralled behind velvet roped barriers, grimly patrolled by equally bored policemen, iron tends to enter the soul. I once spent a freezing cold six hours on a pavement in Manhattan waiting for the 30 seconds during which Charles was visible heading to open a memorial garden for the British victims of 9/11. He didn’t smile and neither did we. Glamorous it ain’t. So, pragmatically, a demo is good for business and opens up issues which otherwise might be ignored or underplayed. So it was last week with the calls for Jamaica and other islands to become republics. It is almost as if the protesters expect the royals to hang on to the realms for grim death, like George III and the American colonies 250 years ago. It isn’t going to happen: the royals have long honed the line that it’s up to the populations themselves to decide how they want their countries to be run. Even George was reconciled to that. So, if the 15 realms want to become republics, that’s fine, up to them, as William said. We can still be friends. The question of reparations for slavery is also beyond the royals’ pay grade. It really is a matter for governments to negotiate and the issue spreads much wider and is more tangled and complicated than the monarchy’s own wealth. Will India want the Koh-i-Noor diamond back, ceded to Britain at the end of the Sikh wars and the conquest of the Punjab in 1849 and now set in one of the crowns? I don’t see why not (perhaps they could let us have it back for occasional coronations) but should it go to the descendants of the Mughal emperors who originally owned it, to Pakistan or to Narendra Modi’s Hindu Nationalist current government? It is a legacy of empire. For better or worse, royal tours are not going to end any time soon. If they do, the monarchy will have lost much of its raison d’etre.

3/29/2022,"The Surface Laptop Studio is Microsoft’s creative workstation that replaces the unique outgoing Surface Book line with a slightly more normal laptop-like form but is still very unusual. The new top of Microsoft’s laptop line costs from £1,449 ($1,399.99/A$2,399) and is a chunky machine geared up as a desktop replacement, rather than a thin and light notebook you carry everywhere. From the top it doesn’t look that unusual: a standard laptop made of magnesium and aluminium with a traditional hinge at the back. Open the lid and it has more than a passing resemblance to the Apple’s MacBook Pro from the 2010s, with a decent-sized and great-looking 14.4in LCD touchscreen with a slick 120Hz refresh rate. It has Windows Hello face recognition for logging in, four good speakers, a great keyboard and a new “haptic touchpad” that brings Microsoft’s trackpads up to par with the best-in-class models from Apple. But grab the display at the top and twist it backwards and things get interesting. The screen magnetically unclips at the bottom so you can position it in “stage mode” on magnets hidden just in front of the trackpad or fold it all the way down on to the deck in “studio mode”. Stage mode is designed for watching video while studio mode turns the laptop into a drawing screen with Microsoft’s excellent, but optional, Slim Pen 2 stylus similar to its unique Studio desktop computer. It makes editing photos, sketching out ideas and even marking up documents a breeze. Turn the laptop over to reveal another unusual design: a stepped back fan base that is hidden when on a desk. The base houses the discrete Nvidia graphics chip and H-series Intel processors, both of which are more powerful and generate more heat than the typical models you find in slimmer machines. The fans weren’t needed for general browsing and light work, but kicked in after a minute or so of photo editing being audible but not distracting. Screen: 14.4in LCD 2,400x1,600 (201 PPI; 120Hz) Processor: Intel Core i5 or i7 (11th generation) Ram: 16 or 32GB Storage: 256, 512GB, 1 or 2TB Graphics: Intel Iris X or Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Ti Operating system: Windows 11 Camera: 1080P front-facing, Windows Hello Connectivity: wifi 6, Bluetooth 5.1, 2x Thunderbolt 4/USB 4, headphones, Surface Connect Dimensions: 323.3 x 228.3 x 18.9mm Weight: 1,743 or 1,820g The performance of the Laptop Studio is a mixed bag. As tested with its highest specification, including the Core i7-11370H quad-core processor and Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Ti graphics chip, it sails through every day work, complex image-editing and other fairly demanding general tasks, as expected. While it can handle everything I would want to do, it is limited on raw power compared to workstation competitors of a similar price, which typically have more performant 6 or 8-core processors. For those looking to render or convert lots of video, process large 3D models or compile mountains of code the Surface comes up a bit short. It can’t manage AAA games with anything greater than low graphics settings, either. The Laptop Studio’s battery life is surprisingly good, lasting almost nine hours of light work, including lots of browsing, note taking, document and spreadsheet-editing and a short bit of image-editing. That’s longer than the 13.5in Surface Laptop 4, but miles behind the 14 hours of the 14in MacBook Pro. More demanding work, such as advanced photo manipulation in studio mode, reduces the battery life to about three hours, while you could expect more than 10 hours of just watching video. Microsoft does not provide an expected lifespan for the Studio Laptop’s battery. Similar batteries typically last in excess of 500 full charge cycles while maintaining at least 80% of their original capacity. The laptop is generally repairable with an out-of-warranty service fee of £551.46 including the battery. The SSD storage is modular, but Microsoft states it should only be removed by technicians. The company operates recycling schemes for old machines, publishes a company-wide sustainability report and a breakdown of each product’s environmental impact. The Laptop Studio runs Windows 11, which like other Surface devices is free of trials for anti-virus programs and other unwanted software that can often cause problems, except a pre-installed trial of Microsoft Office. The new and improved touch keyboard and handwriting recognition make using the machine in studio mode easier. The haptic feedback built into the Slim Pen 2, which makes it vibrate a little as you write on the screen making it feel more like a biro on paper, is fantastic. The Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio starts at £1,449 ($1,399.99/A$2,399) with an Intel Core i5, 16GB of Ram and 256GB of storage. Versions with Intel Core i7 processors and Nvidia graphics start at £1,899 ($1,899.99/A$3,149) with 16GB of Ram and 512GB of storage. The Slim Pen 2 costs £119.99 ($129.99/A$189.95). For comparison, Dell’s XPS 15 with Nvidia graphics costs £1,750, the Razer Blade 14 with Nvidia graphics costs £2,200 and Apple’s 14in MacBook Pro starts at £1,899. The Surface Laptop Studio is another unusual and adaptable Windows 11 laptop from Microsoft. It may not look quite as novel as the Surface Book it replaces, but it offers almost all of the same functionality in a less complicated form. As an expensive standard laptop, it is a bit chunky but great to use on a desk. Fast, generally quiet in operation, with a great screen, keyboard and the best trackpad you can get on Windows. But unclip the screen and it transforms into a brilliant drawing tablet quite unlike any competitor, particularly when used with the excellent Slim Pen 2 stylus, which absolutely should be included in the box not sold as a £120 accessory. However, those looking for a really powerful portable workstation may find its performance lacking in some areas compared to better-specced, but less adaptable rivals at this price. That leaves the Laptop Studio in an awkward middle ground: too expensive to be a standard laptop and with not enough power to be a developer or render’s best friend. If you need a laptop that transforms into a drawing tablet and can pull double-duty as a desktop replacement, the Surface Laptop Studio is the quirky Windows 11 machine for you. Pros: great keyboard and trackpad, great screen with articulating modes, Thunderbolt 4/USB 4, decent battery life, discrete Nvidia graphics card option, good as a laptop or drawing deck, Windows Hello. Cons: chunky, expensive, no 6 or 8-core processor options, very limited port selection, no SD card slot, Slim Pen 2 not included.

3/29/2022,"It has been called the world’s most famous children’s centre, a globally influential early-years family project that grew out of one of the UK’s most deprived communities and provided the inspiration for Sure Start. Now this Great British success story faces disaster – at the hands of its local Tory-run council. North Northamptonshire council’s executive meets on Tuesday morning to discuss proposals to take an axe to the funding of Pen Green, a trailblazing state-funded nursery school in the former steel town of Corby. There is a growing outcry. “Why are they punishing the people who need their support?” said one incredulous parent at a drop-in session. The council is out of touch with reality, said another parent, Anthony Lee, 43, watching his young son playing in the giant sandpit at the heart of Pen Green. He says the cuts fly in the face of everything the government says it stands for: “If you cut the centre’s funding, it is not levelling up – it’s levelling down.” Adam Cooper, Pen Green’s chair, told the Guardian up to £800,000 was at risk, and with it scores of jobs. “It’s going to be catastrophic for us. It’s taking away 75% of our funding,” he said. “We’ve had repeated cuts over the years and we are used to cuts. But this scale of cuts will close us down.” Talk to parents at Pen Green and certain themes recur: it is not just that it provides a great service, but that it is like family; how they trust it; how it doesn’t judge; how it went the extra mile; how it “saved” them at their lowest point. Some said they wouldn’t be alive now without its support. Several weep at the memories. It is a genuinely world-leading model of integrated early-years care – bringing together innovative, high-quality nursery, health, family support and social care services under one roof to provide the best possible start for families in a town scarred by poverty, ill health and poor educational outcomes. More than 1,000 children a year pass through its many services. Now nearly 40 years old, Pen Green has been showered with awards and accolades such as school of the year, Ofsted outstanding and teaching school status. It has trained thousands of childcare and family workers and spawned a thriving research centre. Hundreds of people visit from all over the world every year hoping to learn its magic, from Auckland to Bologna, Glasgow to Kazakhstan. Its ethos is that by reaching out early on to struggling young parents and families and providing them with consistent wrap-around support, it can get their lives on track. This might mean providing therapeutic services, or guiding them through the maze of the special educational needs system. It might mean rebuilding a parent’s confidence, or discreetly providing them with a food parcel. “Former Pen Green nursery children are now headteachers and senior leaders in Corby primary schools. Nursery children with profound disabilities have taken up university places,” said Margy Whalley, the retired founder and former director of Pen Green. There are the everyday successes, too: the parental crises solved, the mental health emergencies tackled, the young people kept off the child protection register. It saves money for the NHS and social services, says Whalley. “It’s insane the council would want to decimate something so successful and that has done so much good.” North Northamptonshire argues in a council paper that essentially it is rectifying a historical funding inequality that has put three other state nurseries in the county at risk of closure. By chopping down Pen Green’s allocation and sharing it out, it argues, it will save the other three. This is not a straightforward story of cuts, however. According to Cooper, the crisis was avoidable: when the council was created out of the wreckage of the bankrupt Northamptonshire county council in 2021, it failed to ask the Department for Education (DfE) to renew nursery funding on the established basis that reflects the extra services Pen Green provides. North Northamptonshire council disagreed. It said the DfE will only issue funds in line with historical funding levels if West Northamptonshire council (created at the same time in 2021) agrees. West Northamptonshire, it says, currently does not agree, so funding reverts to a less generous per-head basis. “This is not an issue of North Northamptonshire council’s making,” a spokesperson said. The council’s leader, Jason Smithers, said: “We recognise the value and importance of early education for children across North Northamptonshire. Therefore we are working to ensure a fair, equitable and transparent funding arrangement for all four of our maintained nurseries to ensure that children and families accessing early education can continue to do so in their own communities.” Angela Prodger, the co-director of Pen Green – who joined it as a 17-year-old trainee nursery nurse in 1983 – reflected on the appalling timing of the cuts, which seem to undermine almost everything the government says it believes in, from family hubs to levelling up, to supporting families through the cost of living crisis. She recalled how Conservative MP Graham Stuart, a Pen Green enthusiast, chaired a House of Commons education select committee meeting at Pen Green in 2014. That day he warned against the bureaucratic destruction of “rare, peculiar centres of excellence that do a brilliant job”, not perhaps anticipating that it would be Tory-run councils that would be the destroyer. Just then local parent Ellie Woods bounded up. She had been in the drop-in session and wanted to correct the impression that the Guardian might have got that Pen Green was like a community. “It’s not a community. It’s a family. It’s like your Nan’s house on a Sunday. You know it is always there for you.”",News/Politics,Influential Pen Green children’s centre faces closure due to council cuts,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/29/pen-green-childrens-centre-family-faces-closure-council-cuts
3/29/2022,"Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool may yet have a say in the matter, true, but Manchester City look set to win a sixth Premier League title since the club was bought by Abu Dhabi royals in 2008. Hard to imagine any of that making sense at the turn of the century, when City were out of the top flight and managed by Kevin Keegan, who could be found blaming yet another cup exit on a 27th-minute red card from the referee. “People should write about Uriah Rennie,” he fumed to reporters after the match, “because that’s what he wants.”One imagines the glee with which Ashley Hickson-Lovence seized on those words for the epigraph to Your Show, a stirring, stylistically unorthodox novel that sets out to do exactly that by fictionalising the life of Rennie, the Premier League’s first black referee. Told as a montage of urgent second-person scenes, it’s a nervy psychodrama fuelled by ambition, envy, doubt and ego, cutting from his Jamaican boyhood and 1970s youth on a tough Sheffield estate to the highs and lows of a trailblazing career forged in a new era of professionalism for officials amid the sport’s sudden, Sky-fuelled glamour of the 1990s.Hickson-Lovence re-creates all the talking points that launched a thousand phone-ins, from the time Rennie broke FA protocol to yank Roy Keane away from an opponent he was about to wallop to the red card he gave Alan Shearer, on the striker’s 100th appearance for Newcastle: the first in a series of run-ins that left the England captain (as fond of an elbow as Rennie was of a card) mischievously wondering aloud whether the referee was pursuing a vendetta. These moments and others are narrated in insistent, fragmentary rhythms that meld You are the Ref-style dilemmas (“Should you caution [Neil] Ruddock? Should you caution [Ian] Wright? Should you book both?”) with freestyle poetry and kick-by-kick match description that speaks of endlessly rewound YouTube footage, to say nothing of quality time spent with David Peace’s Red or Dead, a blueprint for Hickson-Lovence’s biblically iterative prose.As in Peace’s novel, the compositional method feels so basic that it really shouldn’t work, and yet it does, not least because Hickson-Lovence understands the value of ambiguity for his fundamentally celebratory enterprise. While it’s part of the book’s purpose to unpick the caricature of Rennie as a card-happy attention-seeker (the title reclaims an infamous incident in which a stadium announcer sarcastically welcomed back fans after half-time by saying: “Enjoy the second half of the Uriah Rennie show”), it clearly takes delicious pleasure in playing devil’s advocate for more Keeganesque views too: “Auf Wiedersehen, pet,” Rennie thinks, when Shearer finally retires.Those tussles with Shearer, together with Rennie’s dream of overseeing an FA Cup final, add page-turning drive as well as poignancy once Rennie, injury-plagued, likewise hangs up his boots in 2008, just when the petro-dollars started flowing into the game. For Hickson-Lovence, you suspect Rennie’s story represents a simpler time, before VAR, NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and “men… in overpriced PSG tops yapping on about Mbappé”, yet the bittersweet air overhanging this bold and powerful narrative experiment probably has more to do with things that haven’t changed, given that the Premier League’s first black referee is still its last.

3/29/2022,"British Airways has done an about turn over eVouchers it issued for flights it cancelled in 2020 because of Covid. Possibly in an attempt to stave off action by regulators, it now says passengers who received an eVoucher for a cancelled flight between 9 March and 19 November 2020 can swap it for cash. Its website, Ba.com, has the details. Two years ago, BA was among those airlines encouraging people to take a voucher rather than the full cash refund to which they were entitled. The airline says refunds can be applied only for up to 24 months from the date the voucher was issued. “An email will inform you of when this is. You can use your current eVouchers to pay, or part pay, for flights that depart by 30 September 2023.” Rob Burgess, the editor of the frequent-flyer website Headforpoints.com, says this applies only to passengers who had their flights cancelled. “If you voluntarily chose to take a voucher for a flight which was operating, you are not entitled to cash in your voucher,” he says. Separately, SC wrote to say she has finally been refunded for flights that BA’s sister airline, Vueling, cancelled in August 2020. The airline had tried to claim that this had been a result of an “extraordinary circumstance”. She wrote: “I lodged a complaint with the CAA’s passenger complaints team, and shortly afterwards Vueling advised me it was processing my refund. No explanation or apology.” Elsewhere, easyJet has said it is giving some of its passengers more time to spend vouchers, which originally had to be used to make a booking within 12 months. All those due to expire between 1 January and the end of April this year can now be used until 30 April. Passengers don’t need to travel before then but must make a reservation. Anyone who had trips cancelled over the past two years should check the terms of any vouchers, as most have an expiry date. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

3/29/2022,"“They’re coming this way,” shouts Tom. “Looks like they’re going to bow-ride.” I wedge myself against the rail and peer down into the translucent water where, sure enough, three dolphins materialise beneath my nose. Their domed heads rise as one, blowholes flaring with a hydraulic “pfff” as they break briefly into our element before slipping back into theirs, torpedo bodies jockeying like Olympic cyclists in our bow wave. More converge from left and right: 16 in total, including two youngsters that race in tight tandem with their mothers. The hourglass flank pattern identifies these as common dolphins – a smaller, more ocean-going species than the better-known bottlenose. But whatever the species, dolphins always spark the same thrill. We dash from bow to stern, gasping like kids at fireworks as the exuberant cetaceans escort us through the water. It’s a gorgeous day and I’m in the middle of the Channel, 20 miles (32km) out of Weymouth, Dorset. We’re heading towards France, but this is no ferry crossing. Our boat, the Snapper, has been chartered by the wildlife tour company Naturetrek for a pelagic day trip across Lyme Bay. Pelagos is Ancient Greek for “sea”, and the idea is to explore this broad sweep of ocean – demarcated by an imaginary line between Portland Bill in Dorset and Start Point in Devon – in search of wildlife rarely seen from land.Naturetrek is known more for its far-flung overseas adventures. But in 2020, thwarted by the pandemic, the company launched a programme of UK day trips, its expert wildlife guides swapping the likes of Borneo and the Himalayas for the Forest of Dean and the South Downs. And marine guides such as Tom Brereton, a veteran of pelagic tours in Mexico and the Azores, and a research director for conservation charity Marinelife, are now bringing their expertise to more local waters, setting sail from Dorset and Devon. The sky was already cloudless at 8.45am, when we met Tom on the quayside. Having already advised us what to bring (binoculars, hat, sunblock – and sea-sickness pills, if susceptible), and is careful to manage expectations. “It’s a lottery out there. Just enjoy being out at sea; we’ll see what we see.” Soon Weymouth’s grand Georgian seafront is receding behind us as we chug out passing a flotilla of cruise ships mothballed by the pandemic. To ignorant landlubbers like me, the glittering ocean appears one seamless blanket. The truth, Tom explains, is very different. Over the engine’s throb, he outlines the complex forces that lie beneath: how three tides converging around Portland Bill create a treacherous current called the Portland race that has spelt disaster for ships over the ages; and how the breaking white water on our port side marks the Shambles bank, a four-mile sand ridge that at low tide has also brought generations of maritime misery. Tom also explains how the sea’s submarine topography determines what wildlife lives above it. The Shambles bank brings us the day’s first cetaceans: a quartet of harbour porpoises quietly fishing the turbulent shallows, their triangular dorsal fins breaking the surface like slow-turning wheels. As we head south, the coastal birds that escorted us out of the harbour – herring gulls overhead, cormorants across the bows – give way to true ocean-going species: Balearic shearwaters, stiff-winged wanderers from the Mediterranean, angle low over the swell; tiny storm petrels flutter in and out of the wave troughs. At midday, now about 25 miles out, a trawler appears, trailing what appears from a distance to be swirling confetti. It’s gannets, hundreds of them, drawn to the shoaling fish like bees to a honeypot. “We’re coming into birds now,” shouts Tom, as we approach. Soon the sea is detonating around us as these big white plunge-divers smash into the swell and emerge with silver sprats clutched in dagger bills. Kittiwakes join the melee, while fulmars cruise past our bows and great skuas, piratical pursuers of any fishing seabird, cruise menacingly overhead. To starboard, more dolphins arrive, slicing through the surface then disappearing to pile into the shoal from below. This impressive feeding frenzy recalls TV footage of South Africa’s “sardine run”. It is hard to believe we’re in the Channel. “Bluefin tuna have been seen coming in over the last few days,” says Tom, listing some surprising recent Lyme Bay sightings, including ocean sunfish and sea turtles, and, swiping through his phone, crowns it with his own amazing photograph of a leaping thresher shark. “A lucky shot,” he says. “It made the papers.” It’s late afternoon as we chug back into Weymouth harbour, with about 80 more miles of the Channel now in the captain’s log. The sea delivers one final treat: two bottlenose dolphins pass alongside, flashing their irresistible grins. Apparently, the pair have been hanging out around the cruise ships for a while. Dubbed Harry and Wills locally, they have since been identified by marine biologists as a mother and daughter from Scotland’s Moray Firth. Who knows why they made the long journey south or how long they’ll stay. It’s just another mystery of pelagos.

3/29/2022,"Susan Nedell was watching black smoke billowing in the distance from the kitchen window when her cellphone buzzed with an order to evacuate. It was 30 December around 1.30pm, and the Marshall fire had by then been razing neighborhoods for a couple of hours. Yet Nedell’s house in Louisville, Colorado, was some distance away. Expecting to be back within a few hours, she left with only her laptop, some knitting and leftovers for lunch. But this was no ordinary fire. Gusts over 100mph and unprecedented dry conditions helped the wildfire morph into a chaotic swirling blaze that hopped and skipped over rolling hills, highways and lakes into the built-up suburbs. Nedell’s remodelled four-bedroom detached home was burnt to the ground; only a handful of houses in the neighbourhood survived the fire which jumped over six lanes to reach them. “It’s finally sunk in that we’ve been left with nothing, just the land the house was on. That wind took it here, there and everywhere, it was just so fast we were completely unprepared,” said Nedell, 62. Though it burned for just six hours, the Marshall prairie fire became the most destructive in Colorado history, destroying 6,000 acres and almost 1,100 houses and businesses across the towns of Louisville, Superior and unincorporated Boulder county. One person died, 69-year-old Robert Sharpe, and tens of thousands of people were displaced. Three months on and many are struggling to rebuild their lives amid delays and loopholes in insurance coverage and building regulations. Nedell is among about two-thirds of Americans who are underinsured, and she will need to raise several hundred thousand dollars to be able to rebuild the house due to a sharp rise in material costs, the labour shortage and supply chain problems. Few people get their houses valued on a regular basis or adjust the insurance, and neither do the companies, which leaves many people significantly underinsured. Nedell wants to use the opportunity to build back better, so that the new house is sustainable and resilient to future fires and floods. Superior and Louisville have adopted the most up-to-date green codes requiring all new builds to achieve a net zero carbon footprint, which experts estimate will increase building costs by about $20,000. But Marshall fire victims have been granted an opt-out amid concerns that the green codes are unaffordable. Some energy companies are offering incentives to subscribe to solar and energy-efficient materials and appliances, but it’s not enough to cover the shortfall. Colorado is a local control state, so every locality sets its own rules for everything from fracking permits and transit safety to zoning and building codes, but the patchwork approach to building standards is nationwide. “The fire was exacerbated by the changing climate – it’s been disaster after disaster, which is costing us so much more than climate action would,” said Nedell, who wants to build an ultra-low-energy passive house. “We want to do our part and build for a more sustainable future, but the system is broken. We need insurance reforms and statewide building codes, fast.” Boulder county is in the Front Range urban corridor located across the eastern face of the southern Rocky mountains, where 85% of Coloradans live in densely populated cities, towns and suburbs like Superior and Louisville. Colorado has been hit by multiple climate disasters over the past decade, including historic rainfall and flash floods in 2013, drought and two large wildfires in 2020. Despite increasing renewables like wind and solar, the state’s energy grid remains highly dependent on fossil fuels, and it is America’s fifth largest oil and seventh largest gas producer. The Marshall fire left an unusual trail of destruction as strong winds pushed the flames and embers in different directions: some neighbourhoods were completely decimated while others half a block away escaped untouched, or just one or two houses were destroyed. It’s a mosaic of flattened streets, burnt-out shopping malls and blackened fields alongside those that got lucky or held out thanks to resilient structures. One section of the Tesla building in Superior is ruined; the rest is fine. Amid the wreckage, tulips and grass shoots are emerging as the snow glistens on the Rocky mountains, but the smell of smoke lingers around the rubble. In Superior, Trish Zornio left with only her cat and a bag of documents, and while her house is structurally sound, she has not been able to move back due to extensive smoke and ash damage which requires time consuming and expensive restoration work. It’s unclear how many buildings suffered smoke and ash damage – or how many people remain displaced – but it’s probably thousands, and the long-term health implications are unknown. “In retrospect, all the warning signs were there that up and down the Front Range is a tinderbox, but we hadn’t realized how much the wildlife urban interface [WUI] had expanded,” said Zornio, a scientist and columnist with a local paper, the Colorado Sun. WUI refers to residential and commercial development close to wilderness areas with little clearance. According to the US Fire Administration, at least 46m houses in 70,000 communities are at risk for WUI fires, and WUI areas continue to expand by about 2m acres annually. Lucky for Zornio it snowed on the night of the fire, the latest first snowfall on record for the area, which helped save her house, which stood 250ft from the fireline. Half a mile away, her partner’s house also survived but almost everything in between them was charred. Unlike many renters, Zornio, 36, had insurance but reckons she has still ended up several thousand dollars out of pocket due to delays and quibbles over the coverage. She’s not alone, and the state regulator recently told companies to “step up and do better” after widespread complaints about slow and inadequate daily living reimbursements and unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles. But the impacts go way beyond those directly affected. The fire destroyed about 10% of Superior’s housing stock, which added pressure to an already strained market, causing rents to spike and triggering an investigation into price gouging by the state attorney general. “The whole state is a fire risk and we need climate action from the top so we can build back better to improve resilience and reduce emissions to mitigate climate change,” said Zornio. On Saturday, thousands of people were evacuated as a 200-acre wind-driven wildfire threatened neighborhoods just a few miles west of where the Marshall fire burned. Back in Louisville, Ricardo Moreno knows that his family was one of the lucky ones. It was around 3pm when he got the evacuation text, and they drove away as the sky lit orange with flames. The family had moved back from Mexico two weeks earlier, and had bought renters insurance just hours before the blaze. A few hours later embers started a small fire in their neighbour’s yard, which was extinguished by 80-year-old Milos Linhart, a retired firefighter from the Czech Republic, who had slept through the evacuation alert. Linhart put out the flames with a shovel and buckets of water, patrolling the street until the danger had passed. Not a single property was lost, though most suffered ash and smoke damage. Moreno’s house was cleaned, but ash started seeping in through the window frames, so he and his wife, Bonnie, decided to move, but there’s not a single house for rent or sale in the school district – which they don’t want to leave as their son Javi, eight, has autism and is settled in the special ed program. The couple recently bid $75,000 over the asking price for a house, but were outbid by $85,000. Folks have put their burnt-out lots on the market for as much as $400,000, but building costs for a detached house have been estimated at $1m. “The market has exploded – you need riot gear for an open house, people line up before it gets light,” said Moreno, 46. “We never thought there could be a wildfire here, but it was like Paradise in California. It felt dystopian, but honestly, nowhere in the Front Range is safe, so where else can we go?” A few years back Moreno’s mother’s beach house in Mexico was swept away by the rising sea level. Climate scientists warn that unchecked global heating will lead to a rise in catastrophic and unprecedented events such as storm surges, wildfires, drought and flash floods. Still, the cost of losing property is easier to grasp than the implications for our health and wellbeing. Moreno said: “Recently we saw some run-over ducks and my six-year-old daughter Zoé screamed ‘this is it, they kill ducks and burn everything here.’”",News/World news,"Three months after a wildfire swept through, displaced Colorado residents struggle to rebuild",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/marshall-wildfire-swept-colorado-displaced-residents-rebuild
3/29/2022,"The slap that overshadowed the 94th Academy Awards is far from being swept under the red carpet. Actor Will Smith attacked Chris Rock after the comedian made a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, at the ceremony. The joke appeared to reference Pinkett Smith’s alopecia, an auto-immune disease that causes hair loss. Later in the night, Smith won his first Oscar for his role in King Richard. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which hosts the Oscars, said it had launched a formal review into the incident and fans are wondering: could Smith be stripped of his Oscar? The Academy has issued a statement condemning Smith’s actions, announcing it will launch an inquiry to determine further action and consequences. The Academy’s board of governors will meet on Wednesday to discuss the issue. The Academy prohibits uninvited physical contact and according to the association’s bylaws, disciplinary action could include “suspension of membership or expulsion from membership”. Whoopi Goldberg, actor and member of the Academy’s board of governors, said during US talkshow The View on Monday: “We’re not going to take that Oscar from him. There will be consequences I’m sure, but I don’t think that’s what they’ll do.” The Academy does not condone violence of any form.Tonight we are delighted to celebrate our 94th Academy Awards winners, who deserve this moment of recognition from their peers and movie lovers around the world. In 2017 the Academy revoked the membership of Harvey Weinstein at the height of the sexual misconduct scandal surrounding the former film producer, who was later convicted on several charges. The Academy adopted a new code of conduct in 2017 in the wake of the allegations against Weinstein, saying at the time: “There is no place in the Academy for people who abuse their status, power or influence in a manner that violates recognized standards of decency.” Following the new code, Roman Polanski, who was convicted of rape and sex with a minor, was stripped of his membership. So was Bill Cosby, who spent more than two years in jail convicted on sexual assault, but had his charges overturned last year. However, it is worth noting that Polanski – who won best director for The Pianist in 2003, almost 30 years after his conviction for rape – has not had his Oscar taken away from him. Nor has Weinstein had to return any of the 81 Oscars shared between Miramax and The Weinstein Company. He has also not had to give up the one Oscar awarded to him directly: best picture, for his role as a producer on Shakespeare in Love. It is also worth noting that the Academy has not punished actors who have been physically threatening to others during the Oscars ceremony: in 1973, six security guards had to hold back John Wayne when actor and activist Sacheen Littlefeather took to the stage to speak on behalf on Marlon Brando, declining his best actor award to instead speak about Native American rights. Smith issued a written apology to Rock and the Academy Awards on Monday, saying he was “out of line and … wrong” and that his actions were “not indicative of the man I want to be”. “My behaviour at last night’s Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable,” the statement said. “Jokes at my expense are a part of the job, but a joke about Jada’s medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally.” During his Oscar acceptance speech, Smith apologised to the Academy for his behaviour, but this did not include an apology to Rock. Smith’s is undergoing a trial by public opinion. But film publicist Charles McDonald said he thinks Smith’s career can survive given the actor is atoning for his actions. “I think people have a great affection for him. You can’t resort to violence like that, obviously, and the language he used afterwards, despite the provocation. But I think there will be sympathy for him.”",Arts/Culture,Could the Academy take Will Smith’s Oscar back after he slapped Chris Rock? ,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/29/could-the-academy-take-will-smiths-oscar-back-after-he-slapped-chris-rock
3/29/2022,"Good morning, I’m Warren Murray and this is Tuesday’s foremost news. Vladimir Putin’s main spokesman has said the west pushed the Kremlin “into the corner” with Nato expansion, while sanctions on trade, finance and oligarchs were akin to “total war” against Russia. Dmitry Peskov’s remarks in an interview on American TV came amid more claims from UK and Ukrainian military intelligence that Russia’s war effort is in serious trouble. The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Russia was expected to bolster its flagging invasion force by sending more than 1,000 mercenaries from its private Wagner military group into eastern Ukraine as the Kremlin continues to suffer heavy losses. Peace talks that are due to resume between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey today may be overshadowed by reports that the oligarch Roman Abramovich and the Ukrainian MP Rustem Umerov suffered symptoms of poisoning after informal peace negotiations in Kyiv. Both men, who consumed only chocolate and water, were treated in Istanbul for symptoms that reportedly included loss of sight and peeling skin. The account backs up the claims of a potential poisoning first reported in the Wall Street Journal and by the investigative outlet Bellingcat. This morning, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged countries to have the courage to keep supplying weapons to Ukraine without fear of possible Russian retaliation, declaring: “Fear always makes you an accomplice.” Zelenskiy hailed military success in Irpin and in parts of Kyiv. Ukraine’s military intelligence said its forces also continued to defend Motyzhyn, Lisne, Kapitanivka and Dmytrivka. It said Ukrainian forces “continue to maintain the circular defence of the city of Mariupol and defend and deter the advance of the enemy in the Chernihiv region” although UK intelligence said the Russians were gaining ground in Mariupol. According to the mayor of the besieged southern city, almost 5,000 people, including about 210 children, have been killed. Keep up with events at our live blog. Partygate fines loom – The first fines for lockdown breaches in Downing Street are expected to be issued imminently after Scotland Yard concluded laws were broken at the heart of government, sources have told the Guardian. No 10 has promised to reveal if Boris Johnson receives a fixed penalty notice, which could trigger a vote of no confidence in the Commons. It is understood the Met is expected to firstly issue around 20 fines in the most straightforward cases. For two months the force has been examining material from the Sue Gray inquiry into partygate. Police are investigating 12 separate events in 2020 and 2021, six of which Johnson is said to have attended. Smith sorry for slap – Will Smith has issued an apology to Chris Rock, the Oscars and viewers after slapping the comedian on stage, saying it was “not indicative of the man I want to be”. Smith wrote online that he “reacted emotionally” to Rock’s joke about his wife Jada Pinkett Smith’s baldness, related to the condition alopecia, but his behaviour “was unacceptable and inexcusable. Jokes at my expense are a part of the job, but a joke about Jada’s medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally. I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris.” The Academy condemned the assault and said it would launch an inquiry. Janai Nelson, from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, wrote online: “I know we’re all still processing, but the way casual violence was normalised tonight by a collective national audience will have consequences that we can’t even fathom in the moment.” Special needs at school – Mainstream schools in England are to be required to “change their culture and practice” to become more inclusive of children with special educational needs and disabilities, abbreviated as Send. The government will set out plans to overhaul the Send system in a green paper published today. The paper will propose new national standards across education, health and care to better support children with Send, plus a legal requirement for councils to publish inclusion plans. An “inclusion dashboard” is proposed to help parents understand what support is available in their area. Under the current regime, parents often have to engage in lengthy battles to try to secure the right provision for their child. Publication of the paper will be followed by a 13-week consultation. Type 2 risks abound – People with type 2 diabetes have a higher risk of 57 other health conditions including cancer, kidney disease and neurological illnesses, according to a Cambridge study. The condition, which is linked to being overweight, inactive or having a family history of diabetes, affects millions worldwide. Researchers found those with type 2 have the related health problems as many as five years earlier than people without it. Separately, experts are calling for genetic testing to predict how individuals will respond to medicines. About 6.5% of UK hospital admissions are caused by drug reactions while most prescription medicines only work on 30% to 50% of people. The British Pharmacological Society and the Royal College of Physicians are proposing personalised prescribing according to people’s genes. Wronging rights – The British government is committing “vandalism” as it attempts to dismantle the Human Rights Act and bring in “draconian” legislation on refugees and policing, says Amnesty International’s annual report. Sacha Deshmukh, head of Amnesty UK, said the Human Rights Act was the “central pillar of rights and protections in the UK … It’s the means by which we can challenge police behaviour, contest poorer health outcomes for ethnic minority groups, and ensure a proper Covid inquiry.” Amnesty also criticises the government’s nationality and borders bill, which is going through parliament, and the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill. On a global scale, Amnesty says post-pandemic promises to “build back better” have been broken by governments across the world. Despite enough production to fully vaccinate the world in 2021, by the end of the year under 4% of those living in poor countries had been fully vaccinated. Crypto climate stakes – Cryptocurrency mining creates a huge carbon footprint but a switch in its computer coding could fix that, says a campaign being launched today. Change the Code Not the Climate seeks to replace the “proof of work” system – under which computers use huge amounts of electricity to validate and secure transactions – with another system called “proof of stake”, where miners have to pledge their coins to verify transactions. The campaign says it would use 99% less power. Michael Brune, the campaign director, said that under proof of work, redundant fossil fuel plants in the US were being cranked back up just to power crypto mining, meaning there was “no way we can reach our climate goals”. The Ethereum crypto-coin is planned to switch over to proof of stake this year. P&O’s sacking of 800 UK employees without notice prompted outrage from politicians and unions alike.

Bee Wilson on how we can restore that lost connection to food. The first index to track race representation across UK sport has led to 43% of national governing bodies being handed the lowest three available grades. Paul Collingwood, the interim head Test coach, says England have “bottomed out” and that captain Joe Root has the backing of the players and management. Gareth Southgate has said it is unfortunate that the pandemic means England will face only one non-European opponent in the year leading up to the 2022 World Cup. George Russell has warned that he and his teammate, Lewis Hamilton, have no chance of fighting for the Formula One title unless Mercedes drastically improves. The remaining tickets for the final of the women’s European Championship sold out in an hour with 100 days to go before England kick off against Austria at Old Trafford. And a group of more than 70 current and former Canadian gymnasts have called for an independent investigation into what they described as a “toxic culture and abusive practices” within their sport in the country. The governor of the Bank of England has warned that the rise in energy prices could be worse than any single year of the oil shock of the 1970s. Andrew Bailey said demand from consumers and businesses was slowing because of soaring prices for gas, electricity and other goods and services. The FTSE100 will gain 0.4% this morning, according to futures trade, and the pound is worth $1.310 and €1.191. The Guardian leads today with “Ukraine peace talks resume amid claims Abramovich was poisoned” – the sanctioned oligarch was involved in informal negotiations as part of a Russian-Ukrainian group, separate from the official talks. The main picture shows Will Smith and Chris Rock just after the slap. The Mirror has “Abramovich poisoned at peace talks” while the Daily Mail says he was left “blinded” and with peeling skin. That gets the big headline on the Times’ front as well although across the top it has “Sunak dampens hope of more help with energy bills”. The Sun says “Chemical ‘attack’ on Roman” while the Telegraph leads with “Partygate fines to be issued from today”. The i says “Johnson and Sunak row goes nuclear” – that’s because the PM’s flagship energy strategy has been held up amid disagreement with the chancellor about funding a new generation of up to eight nuclear power stations, costing the public more than £13bn. The Express says “Triple lock is back! Pensions are set to rise by 7.4%” – the triple lock won’t be reinstated until next year, though. “Duke back on parade” – that’s the Metro, because Prince Andrew will attend a thanksgiving service for his late father. The Financial Times has “Britons face ‘historic shock’ to incomes, BoE governor warns” and its front-page picture story says the Ukrainians have regained ground against the Russian invaders.
