4/15/2022,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Ri Chun Hi, North Korea’s most famous state TV anchor, has announced major events for decades, including nuclear and missile tests and the death of a leader, with an instantly identifiable, passionate voice. The anchor, dubbed the “pink lady” abroad for her bright traditional Korean attire, became the topic of official North Korean media herself Thursday after leader Kim Jong Un gave her a luxurious residence and asked her to continue to serve as the voice of his ruling Workers’ Party. Experts say Kim is providing special treatment to elite North Koreans to boost their loyalty as he grapples with the pandemic, a troubled economy and a stalemate in nuclear diplomacy with the United States. “(Kim) said it is the sincerity of the party that it would spare nothing for a national treasure like her, who has worked as a revolutionary announcer for the party for more than 50 years since her girlhood,” the official Korean Central News Agency said. Kim expressed his “expectation that she would as ever vigorously continue her work in good health as befitting a spokeswoman for the party.” Kim met Ri, who is about 79, on Wednesday after inaugurating a newly built riverside terraced residential district in Pyongyang, the capital, KCNA said. It said houses in the district were presented to Ri and other people who have given distinguished service to the state. North Korea often inaugurates construction projects to mark key state anniversaries. Friday is the 110th birthday of Kim’s late grandfather, state founder Kim Il Sung. It’s the most important anniversary in North Korea, which has been ruled by three generations of the Kim family since its foundation in 1948. The new housing area is where Kim Il Sung’s official residence was located until the 1970s. Pyongyang is North Korea’s showcase city, and its elite residents enjoy relatively affluent lives compared with people in remote rural areas where many still suffer from poverty and malnutrition. A majority of North Koreans who have fled the country in the past two decades have come from its northern regions close to the border with China. “By giving houses to those who have been faithful to him, Kim Jong Un would want to further bolster their loyalty and internal unity,” said Moon Seong Mook, an analyst with the Seoul-based Korea Research Institute for National Strategy. “Ri Chun Hi is a clear example of such people as she’s strongly propagated his nuclear and missile tests and served as a sort of bugler for him.” Kim toured Ri’s house with her and held her hand as they descended the stairs. Ri said she felt her new house is like a hotel and that all her family members “stayed up all night in tears of deep gratitude for the party’s benevolence,” according to KCNA. Ri later used her trademark over-the-top speaking technique to narrate a state TV video of Kim showing her the house. Ri joined state TV in the early 1970s when the country was still governed by Kim Il Sung, and she has gradually become the face and voice of the country’s propaganda-driven news broadcasts. Her close ties to Kim were shown last year at a government foundation anniversary ceremony when she watched from an elevated veranda right next to Kim, and at one point put her hand on his shoulder and whispered to him. At another event, she was the first person to shake Kim's hand before holding his arm and posing for a group photo. Moon, the analyst, said Ri receives Cabinet member-level treatment at home, appears healthy and is expected to continue to handle key televised announcements for at least the next few years. Ri's passionate, effusive style has sometimes generated laughter in other countries. In 2011, a Taiwanese TV station apologized after one of its newsreaders mimicked the tone Ri used when she announced the death of Kim’s father, Kim Jong Il. Since inheriting power upon his father's death, Kim Jong Un, 38, has led North Korea with absolute authority. But he is facing one of the toughest moments of his rule after the coronavirus pandemic shocked an economy already in dire shape from mismanagement and U.S.-led sanctions. Analysts say recent missile tests were meant to advance his weapons arsenal and pressure the U.S. into recognizing North Korea as a nuclear state and relaxing international sanctions.",World/Associated Press,Kim gives North Korea's most famous newscaster a luxury home,https://news.yahoo.com/kim-gives-north-koreas-most-080406035.html
4/15/2022,"While Sunny Balwani’s legal team maintains that he was simply an investor in Theranos, newly revealed text messages cast his involvement with the infamous startup in a new light. During Balwani’s trial, a collection of private text messages were shown to jurors to help them gain insight into the nature of Balwani’s romantic relationship with Elizabeth Holmes and their business partnership. “I am responsible for everything at Theranos,” Balwani wrote in one text exchange to Holmes, as reported by NBC. “I worked six years day and night to help you ... sad about where we are,” Balwani also texted Holmes, emphasizing his dedication to his work at Theranos, according to NBC. The relationship between Holmes—Theranos' founder—and her ex-boyfriend Balwani—its former president and chief operating officer—is a talking point the lawyers have brought up repeatedly in both fraud cases. In the public eye, Holmes was in charge of Theranos, and in 2017, she even told the SEC that she was “the ultimate decision-maker” for the company. The former start-up CEO was touted as the youngest self-made billionaire in 2015.. Beyond being the face of the company, Holmes also represented Theranos at prestigious conferences like President Bill Clinton’s CGI (Clinton Global Initiative) meeting in 2015, a 2014 TEDMED Talk, and a WallStreet Journal’s WSJD Live 2015. While Balwani’s image wasn’t known to the public, his private influence was present in all areas of the company according to the newly revealed text exchanges where he admits to wielding a lot of power and takes responsibility for Theranos. This new information undermines the position of his legal defense, which maintains that he wasn’t in charge of the company. Balwani is currently on trial for his role in the company defrauding investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars. He is charged with 10 counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. He has pleaded not guilty to all 12 counts. Holmes has previously labeled Balwani as verbally and sexually abusive and even claimed that Balwani controlled what she ate and berated her, likening her leadership skills to a “monkey trying to fly a spaceship.” Holmes was found guilty on Jan. 4 of one count of conspiracy and three counts of wire fraud “in connection with a multi-million-dollar scheme to defraud investors in Theranos, Inc.,” according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Holmes is currently living in her $135 million Silicon Valley mansion awaiting her sentencing in September. She faces up to 80 years in prison. Holmes met Balwani in China when she was 18 and he was 37. After Holmes dropped out of Stanford University in 2004, she soon moved in with Balwani in 2005. Holmes is known her affinity for green juice after her former executive assistant at Theranos began creating popular TikTok videos where she recalled her experiences working at the infamous blood testing company, such as being tasked to go to Whole Foods twice a day to pick up “incredibly fresh” green juice. The popularity of the limited Hulu series, “The Dropout,” which stars Amanda Seyfried as Holmes, has caused a resurgence of interest in the outcome of Balwani’s trial. In the series, Holmes’ relationship with Balwani—which is kept secret from their colleagues— is one of the most interesting dynamics in the show and has multiple dramatic scenes that are based in real life. This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Business/Fortune,Texts between Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes and ex-COO Sunny Balwani show their dynamic in a new light,https://news.yahoo.com/texts-between-theranos-founder-elizabeth-221327594.html
4/15/2022,"A man in India has died by self-immolation after his boss reportedly demanded to have sex with his wife in exchange for a transfer.

Gokul Prasad, a 45-year-old technical lineman, was feeling distressed after his boss, junior engineer Nagendra Kumar, offered to process Prasad’s transfer if he sent “his wife [over] for a night.”

Both were employed at the Palia power station of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPCL) in Lakhimpur Kheri, India.

Prasad had asked for a transfer so he could work closer to home and not commute as much, according to his wife.

On April 9, Prasad proceeded to pour diesel fuel over his body and light himself on fire in front of Kumar’s office. He was rushed to the hospital where he succumbed to his injuries and died the day after.

Before his death, Prasad recorded a video complaining about years of harassment and work abuse that he received from Kumar and his aide. Prasad claimed that Kumar was abusing his power, and he blamed him and his aide for his later death.

Prasad said he reported the abuse to the police, but he did not receive assistance and “nothing happened.”

Gokul’s wife explained that he was harassed by Kumar and his aide for three years before falling into “depression” while “taking medication.”

“He went into depression, and started taking medication, but they did not spare him. He was transferred to Aliganj and was facing difficulty in traveling. So he asked for a transfer closer home. They told him, ‘get your wife to sleep with us and we will get you transferred,’” Gokul’s wife said.

She also claimed that nobody came to help Gokul when he set himself on fire, and Kumar had “stood there and watched.”

Sanjiv Suman, a senior police officer, stated that Kumar and his aide are now facing charges for abetment to suicide and intentional provocation under the Indian Penal Code. Both have been suspended from UPCL.

“The lineman had alleged that the junior engineer used to demand money and made vulgar statements when he sought a transfer. We have registered a case. At the department level, the junior engineer has been suspended and an inquiry ordered. The case has been registered under the abetment to suicide charge,” Suman said.

4/15/2022,"An Alaskan guide was filming a survival video in Juneau, Alaska, for her 170,000 TikTok followers when she suddenly heard a landslide heading toward her. Buy, sell or hold? How to decide what to do with a plummeting stock The woman, who goes by the Dirty Explorer (@thedirtyexplorer) on TikTok, stopped filming her video and looked up, terrified, when she heard a landslide approaching. She quickly picked up her phone and kept recording as she ran as fast as she could away from her filming spot. See this Manhattan apartment get an unbelievable maximalist makeover with just $1,000: At one point, according to the text overlay, she thinks the landslide is either stopping or slowing down, but viewers can hear the sudden increase in sound that indicates the main slide is just beginning. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, sounds like a faint rumbling or trees cracking indicate an approaching landslide. It’s advised that if you think a landslide is coming, you should leave your location — even without your belongings — and run out of its path. If that’s not possible, try to protect your head. Halfway through the TikTok, @thedirtyexplorer waved her arms and yelled “Stop!” to a nearby truck on the road. “Stop!” she screamed. “Stop your car!” She explained in the text overlay that the truck was about to encounter a blind turn while traveling at 50 miles per hour that would’ve put it right in the landslide danger zone. “Literally, 30 seconds and [I would] get f***ing killed,” the truck driver told @thedirtyexplorer. “Can we think about that?” “I ran screaming down the road, just so you know, on the beach flailing my arms,” she responded. Commenters were amazed by @thedirtyexplorer’s quick thinking and reaction. “Impeccable decision making,” one said. “This is what survival instinct looks like,” another agreed. “Great job.” “The adrenaline must have been REAL,” someone wrote. “So glad you quickly recognized what was going on and acted.” In a follow-up video, @thedirtyexplorer showed the aftermath of the landslide and wrote, “If you think you ran far enough, no you didn’t.” She also took the opportunity to make a point about man-made climate change continuing to impact people every day. A study analyzing the High Mountain Asia region of China, Tibet and Nepal found a link between more frequent and intense rainfalls — a result of climate change — could cause more landslides in the area. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency confirmed in 2021 that climate change can affect the intensity and frequency of precipitation. There has also been a significant increase in “heavy precipitation” — instances where rainfall or snowfall exceeds what is normal for the area — since the 1980s.

4/15/2022,"Four men have been arrested after one of the accused’s phones was discovered to contain a video of them gang-raping a Bengal monitor lizard at the Sahydari Tiger Reserve in Maharashthra, India.

CCTV footage from the Maharashtra Forest Department showed the four men lurking around the forest and trespassing into the Sahyadri Tiger Reserve, which was created by the Indian government in 2008 to conserve Bengal tigers.

In addition to the video of the men sexually abusing the monitor lizard, officials also found photos of various animals such as porcupines and deer on the mens’ phones.

Bengal monitor lizards can grow up to five and a half feet long and weigh almost 16 pounds. They are currently categorized as reserve species under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972.

Forest guards initially only caught one of the accused, while the others fled. The remaining three were later found in Hativ village in the Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra. Officials said the men came to Kolhapur’s Chandoli village from Konkan to hunt.

The four hunters have been identified as Sandeep Tukram, Pawar Mangesh, Janardhan Kamtekar and Akshay Sunil.

The case was taken to the Indian Penal Court to discuss proper legal action and charges against the four men. According to the Indian Penal Code, Section 377 states that anyone who voluntarily commits intercourse with an animal “shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.”

4/15/2022,"The mystery of why humans die at around 80, while other mammals live far shorter or longer lives, may finally have been solved by scientists. Humans and animals die after amassing a similar number of genetic mutations, researchers have found, suggesting the speed of DNA errors is critical in determining the lifespan of a species. There are huge variations in the lifespan of mammals in the animal kingdom, from South Asian rats, which live for just six months, to bowhead whales, which can survive for 200 years. Previously, experts have suggested that size is the key to longevity, with smaller animals burning up energy more quickly, requiring a faster cell turnover, which causes a speedier decline. But a new study from the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge suggests the speed of genetic damage could be the key to survival, with long-living animals successfully slowing down their rate of DNA mutations regardless of their size. It helps explain how a five-inch long naked mole rat can live for 25 years, about the same as a far larger giraffe, which typically lives for 24. When scientists checked their mutation rates, they were surprisingly similar. Naked mole rats suffer 93 mutations a year and giraffes 99. In contrast, mice suffer 796 mutations a year and only live for 3.7 years. The average human lifespan in the study was 83.6 years, but the mutation rate was far lower at around 47. Genetic changes, known as somatic mutations, occur in all cells and are largely harmless, but some can start a cell on the path to cancer or impair normal functioning. Dr Alex Cagan, the first author of the study, said: “To find a similar pattern of genetic changes in animals as different from one another as a mouse and a tiger was surprising. “But the most exciting aspect of the study has to be finding that lifespan is inversely proportional to the somatic mutation rate. This suggests that somatic mutations may play a role in ageing.” The team analysed genetic errors in the stem cells from the intestines of 16 species of mammal and found that the longer the lifespan of a species, the slower the rate at which mutations occur. The average number of mutations at the end of lifespan across species was around 3200, suggesting there is a critical mass of errors after which a body is unable to function correctly. Although the figure differed about threefold across species the variation was far less than the variation in body size, which varied up to 40,000 fold. The researchers believe the study opens the door to understanding the ageing process, and the inevitability and timing of death. Dr Inigo Martincorena, the senior author of the study, said: “Ageing is a complex process, the result of multiple forms of molecular damage in our cells and tissues. “Somatic mutations have been speculated to contribute to ageing since the 1950s, but studying them has remained difficult. “With the recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies, we can finally investigate the roles that somatic mutations play in ageing and in multiple diseases.” The research was published in the journal Nature.",Science/The Telegraph,Mystery of why humans die around 80 may finally be solved,https://news.yahoo.com/mystery-why-humans-die-around-173539273.html
4/15/2022,"Russia has been accused of ""abandoning"" the bodies of 1,500 soldiers in Ukraine as tens of thousands die during Vladimir Putin’s invasion. Ukraine has claimed more than 20,000 Russian troops have been killed since Putin ordered his troops to begin their offensive on 24 February. While the number has not been independently verified, last month a Nato source put the numbers of Russian soldiers killed at between 7,000 and 15,000. The Kremlin has remained largely quiet about how many of its soldiers have died as a result of Putin's invasion, though it has acknowledged suffering ""significant losses"". Read more: Russian commander deliberately killed by his own demoralised troops, Western officials claim On Wednesday, Ukrainian authorities claimed Russia has left behind the bodies of their troops killed, and offered the mothers of the dead to have access to their loved ones. The defence ministry tweeted: ""There are more than 1,500 corpses of Russian soldiers in the morgues of the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Their command isn’t even thinking about bringing them home. ""Dnipro deputy mayor Mykhailo Lysenko said that the city authorities are ready to provide Russian mothers with access to the bodies of their sons, since the government that sent them to die in Ukraine lacks the courage to do so."" Oleksiy Arestovych, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, said on Friday that the Kremlin had refused to accept the corpses of 3,000 of its regular soldiers early in the war.

We don’t have this number. We’re not ready to accept them."" There have been prior reports of the Russian army leaving its dead behind. On 3 March, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed the invaders had brought crematoriums with them to dispose of their dead. He told reporters: ""The Russian people are dying here, nobody is counting them, people dying in this war. Do you know they have brought a cremation chamber with them? ""They're not going to show the bodies to their families. They're not going to tell the mothers that their children died here."" Morale is said to be dropping amongst Russian troops, and Western officials claimed last month that an army commander was killed by a group of demoralised soldiers fed up with the scale of losses during the invasion of Ukraine. The commander of the 37th rifle brigade, named by officials as Colonel Medvechek, is understood to have been run over by one of his own soldiers who had grown frustrated by his unit's heavy losses. Russia is believed to be sending top leaders to the frontlines in a bid to bolster low morale among troops. Putin had reportedly hoped to take over Ukraine in a matter of days, but now seven weeks into the conflict troops have retreated from areas in the north to focus on renewed assault on cities in the south of the country. Since being pushed out of those areas, Putin has faced fresh accusations of war crimes. Ukraine accused Russian troops of killing hundreds of civilians in the town of Bucha, just outside of Kyiv, following their retreat. On Thursday, Russia was expelled from the UN Human Rights Council after delegates voted 93 to 24 to remove them following allegations of Russian soldiers carrying out mass killings, rape and torture. Instead Western intelligence has indicated forces are regrouping for a new eastern offensive in the Donbas region. Zelenskyy told BILD he expects intense fighting in the coming days.

4/15/2022,"Twitter is considering a ""poison pill"" defense to fight a takeover bid by Elon Musk, per The New York Times. The Information also reported Thursday the board planned to resist the move. Elon Musk offered to buy Twitter at a valuation of $43 billion. As Twitter's own bio exclaims, ""What's happening?!"" One could say the same about a fast-moving Thursday—and preceding couple of weeks—amid Elon Musk's attempt to buy Twitter. The New York Times and The Information both reported Thursday that Twitter's board of directors is not inclined to embrace the offer. Twitter declined to comment. A person familiar with the situation told The Information that Musk's acquisition attempt is unwanted by the board, the outlet wrote. Meanwhile, Twitter's board is debating using a method called a ""poison pill,"" to prevent Musk from pushing the company into selling, two people with knowledge of the situation said, The New York Times reported. The Times added that the board met on Thursday to consider Elon Musk's bid to acquire the company at a $43 billion valuation. The poison pill tactic, also known as a shareholder rights plan, is used to avoid hostile takeovers by essentially diluting an acquirer's stake via creating more shares in the market — or allowing other current shareholders to buy more shares at a discount, creating a ""pill"" that makes a hostile takeover more financially painful to achieve. Elon Musk became Twitter's biggest shareholder in early April, but Vanguard Group increased its stake and now is, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. Musk said if he weren't able to buy the company, he would think about selling his stake. On Thursday Twitter called the offer ""unsolicited"" and ""non-binding,"" and said it would review it. ""I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe,"" Musk said in a Wednesday letter to Twitter's board chair Bret Taylor, the NYT reported Thursday.

4/15/2022,"Former Japanese Princess Mako Komuro now has a position at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

Mako is reportedly working in the museum’s Asian art collection as an unpaid volunteer, assisting curators prepare an exhibition of paintings related to a 13th century monk who traveled through Japan introducing Buddhism.

With a degree in art from International Christian University and a master's in art museums and gallery studies from the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom, Mako certainly has the qualifications to work at the Met.

Mako and her husband, Kei Komoro, moved to New York last year following their marriage in Japan last October that was publicly scrutinized due to Komoro’s commoner status. Mako, who was born a member of the royal family, married Komoro, renouncing her royal status as well as forfeiting a $1.3 million payout that she would have received had she married nobility.

The couple met in 2013 while studying at International Christian University and got engaged in 2017. Their marriage in 2021, a small civil ceremony in Tokyo, marked the first time in post-World War II Japan that a female royal got married without a traditional ceremony.

The union has been protested in Japan, with the media digging into Kei’s past and bringing up allegations of financial dishonesty against his mother. Comparisons to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, who also made news for exiting the British royal family, have inevitably been drawn, with nicknames such as “Japan’s Harry and Meghan” being assigned to the couple.

According to the imperial household agency, Mako developed post-traumatic stress disorder over the widely negative media coverage and public criticism.

Her husband Komoro is an aspiring lawyer with a law degree from Fordham University and is currently working at the Lowenstein Sandler law firm in Manhattan. He is reportedly trying to pass the New York State bar exam.

The two live in a one-bedroom apartment in New York overlooking the Hudson River. It is reportedly just 10 minutes from the Met, and similar apartments in their building cost around $4,300 monthly.

4/15/2022,"By David Morgan and Doina Chiacu WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Republican National Committee voted unanimously on Thursday to withdraw from the Commission on Presidential Debates, saying the group that has run the debates for decades was biased and refused to enact reforms. ""We are going to find newer, better debate platforms to ensure that future nominees are not forced to go through the biased CPD in order to make their case to the American people,"" the committee's chairperson, Ronna McDaniel, said in a statement. The RNC's action requires Republican candidates to agree in writing to appear only in primary and general election debates sanctioned by the committee. The nonprofit commission, founded in 1987 to codify the debates as a permanent part of presidential elections, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It was unclear what format future RNC-backed debates would take or whether they would take place as often as in recent decades. The move, which followed months of wrangling between the RNC and the commission, will potentially deprive voters of seeing Republican and Democratic candidates on the same stage. Millions of Americans usually watch the presidential debates, and many viewers say they help them make up their minds about whom to vote for, according to research by the Pew Research Center. The Democratic National Committee, the RNC's counterpart for President Joe Biden's party, accused Republicans of trying to hide from voters. ""Voters can count on hearing from President Biden and Vice President (Kamala) Harris, who are proud of their records,"" DNC chairperson Jaime Harrison said in a statement. The RNC's decision follows grievances aired by former President Donald Trump and other Republicans about the timing of debates, debate formats and the selection of moderators. Defenders of the debates say they are an important element of the democratic process, but critics say they have become television spectacles in which viewers learn little about the candidates' policies. Trump refused to participate in what was supposed to be the second of three debates with Biden in 2020, after the commission switched it to a virtual contest following Trump's COVID-19 infection. The RNC said the commission ""refused to enact simple and commonsense reforms.""

4/15/2022,"Racist. Anti-Semitic. Unhinged. The suspect in Tuesday’s shooting on the New York City subway is a prolific user of social media, regularly uploading lengthy, often racist diatribes to both YouTube and Facebook in which he addresses a range of topics from the state of race relations in the United States to the policies of New York City Mayor Eric Adams, according to videos reviewed by Rolling Stone. More from Rolling Stone Accused Subway Shooter Held Without Bail Following First Court Appearance Subway Shooting Suspect Called Vegas Shooting 'a Cautionary Tale' Frank R. James, Suspect in NYC Subway Shooting, Arrested After being named a person-of-interest Tuesday evening, Adams said Frank R. James, 62, was now considered a suspect in the shooting, which took place in Brooklyn during morning rush hour aboard a Manhattan-bound N train between 59th and 36th streets around 8:30 a.m. Adams gave a series of interviews Wednesday morning, April 13, during which he said he was confident James would be arrested soon. He also offered an update on four people who were injured during the attack, saying they were still hospitalized. “We’re going to catch this person, and we’re going to bring him to justice and hold him responsible for this horrific act,” Adams said on CNN (via The New York Times). One of the photos of James released by NYPD was taken from a recently uploaded YouTube video titled “STOP ONE COMPLETE,” which was posted to a channel called “prophet oftruth88.” A Facebook page under the name “profitofdoom008” contains videos similar to those posted to the “prophet oftruth88” YouTube channel, some of which feature an individual sporting identical clothing worn in the YouTube videos, and also includes a playlist titled “PROPHETOFTRUTH88.” On Wednesday, YouTube wiped James’ channel, saying it was “terminated for violating YouTube’s Community Guidelines.” (A rep for YouTube did not immediately return Rolling Stone‘s request for comment.) Although the man in videos uploaded to both the YouTube and Facebook accounts never identifies himself by name, he bears a strong resemblance to photos of James distributed by authorities. In a news conference Tuesday, NYPD commissioner Keechant Sewell stated Mayor Adams’ security detail has been bolstered “in light of the videos,” the New York Times reported — thus indirectly confirming the link between James and the disturbing social media posts. In his videos — which number in the hundreds and feature titles such as “why we need more racial profiling,” “should the black woman be forcibly sterilized,” and “TO KILL OR NOT TO KILL” — James often rails against numerous racial and ethnic groups, including whites, Blacks, Jews, and Latinos. He also compares people of color to “a bunch of turds in a toilet,” waiting to be “flushed” down the drain by society, and implies that a race war between whites and Blacks is imminent. In one video, he calls Sept. 11, 2001 “the most beautiful day in the history of this country.” “White people and Black people should not have any contact with each other,” he says in a March 23 video titled “born in an insane asylum.” “Their anger is building up. Nothing can happen here differently than what happened over in Europe with the Jews. I want you to believe that that’s possible.”  In a March 2 video named “TOLD YOU SO,” James uses a news segment on recent subway attacks as a segue into an attack on Mayor Adams’ policies against crime and homelessness, seemingly implying that his struggles are a direct result of the failures of New York City social services. “These are the people that was supposed to be helping me. They made me worse,” he says, gesturing to a computer screen opened to a photo file named “THEM HOSE,” which appears to display headshots of employees of New Jersey’s Bridgeway Behavioral Health Services — an organization James references in numerous videos. “They made me fucking worse. They made me more dangerous than I could ever — than anything, anyone could ever fucking imagine. These are the people that Eric Adams wants to send out to help the homeless and whatever the case may be. It ain’t gonna happen.” James then goes on to describe the individuals as Adams’ “calvary,” before launching into a homophobic and anti-Semitic screed against the South Bronx Mental Health Council and Albert Einstein College of Medicine. “A bunch of fucking predators. A bunch of deviants. A bunch of psychopath and sociopathic fucking bitches,” he says. “They’re going to help you, Eric.” In the same video, James mocks the mayor’s subway safety plan rolled out earlier this year, going so far as to suggest he could easily commit a crime in a subway station without being caught. “He can’t stop no fucking crime in no subways. He may slow it down, but he ain’t stopping shit,” he laughs, adding that the large number of entry and exit points from subway stations would make apprehending criminals nearly impossible. “With this program in place, with all these police — I’d still get off. I know I could get off because they can’t be everywhere… Those who go on to commit crimes, like shooting? That means you have to have police in every station, and that’s not possible.” Among the many topics James tackles in his rambling, slur-laden videos is his belief that Black Americans have allowed themselves to be “Europeanized” by whites. He occasionally flip flops between admiration and hatred for other Black Americans, often espousing Black nationalist ideals and calling for the creation of a Black ethnostate before immediately disparaging educated Blacks and prominent Black women such as Vice President Kamala Harris and newly confirmed Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. “If they tried to exterminate us, I would not be mad for one fucking bit,” he says of white people. “They can’t live with each other, but they’re going to live with your Black ass? Your half-monkey, cursed by God, Black fuckin’ stinkin’ ass?” One of James’ most egregiously racist videos is “they hate jew” — a convoluted, semi-autobiographical tirade uploaded to Facebook in late 2017 that finds him fantasizing about killing a Latino man whom he claims prevented him from advancing his machining career, and suggesting that Jewish individuals “have so much contempt for Blacks,” despite undergoing the horrors of the Holocaust. “These Jews obviously haven’t learned shit from their experience. You know, it hasn’t humbled them in the slightest,” he says. “They’re all — or the majority of them — still arrogant and still feel they’re superior and something above Black people. And, again, those motherfuckers don’t contribute to shit to life on this earth but shit, piss, pollution, and death and destruction.” James’ consistent use of the same usernames results in an online footprint that leads to several more YouTube accounts — one of which, WFJFURADIO, contains content that the uploader states dates back to as early as 2002. Another account containing videos over a decade old features a man wearing the exact same shirt worn by James in the “born in an insane asylum” clip from just one month ago. How James managed to slip under the radar for so long, despite repeatedly making violent threats and spreading hate speech through some of the most heavily moderated social media platforms, remains a mystery. Yet, as of early Wednesday morning, James still has not been identified as the prime suspect in the subway shooting. However, his final rage-filled upload, an April 11 clip called “DOMESTICATED AVERAGES,” serves as an eerie precursor to Tuesday’s violence, revealing the mindset of a mentally anguished hatemonger at his breaking point.  “I’ve been through a lot of shit, where I can say I wanted to kill people. I wanted to watch people die right in front of my fucking face immediately,” he says. “But, I thought about the fact that, ‘Hey man, I don’t wanna go to no fucking prison.’ Fuck that…So, I had to absorb the bullshit. Even though it was building up inside me, what could I do? Not much.” Updated at 9:08 a.m. ET on 4/13/22 to reflect that Frank R. James is now considered a suspect, and not just a person of interest, in the NYC subway shooting. Updated at 12:32 p.m. ET on 4/13/22 after YouTube deleted James’ channel.

4/15/2022,"If Lake Powell isn’t already doomed, it may soon be. Insufficient runoff has put the reservoir on a quick and dangerous descent to 3,490 feet of elevation – a water level so low that Glen Canyon Dam’s hydropower turbines can no longer operate. A key part of the Western power grid would be lost. The city of Page and the LeChee Chapter of the Navajo Nation also would lose their drinking water because the infrastructure that supplies them could no longer function. Not to mention that if Powell falls to 3,490 feet, the only way millions of acre-feet of Colorado River water can flow past the dam and downstream to sustain Lake Mead – the reservoir on which Arizona relies – is through four bypass tubes, which have never handled that kind of volume, particularly for an extended period. Engineers are concerned whether this setup can move enough water, especially if one or more of the tubes were damaged by heavy flows over time. If the bypass tubes move significantly less water than what the eight turbines do now, that could all but guarantee the demise of Lake Mead. This is serious. The U.S. Department of the Interior, which operates the two reservoirs via the Bureau of Reclamation, said in a grimly worded letter last week that it must take more drastic actions to slow Powell’s descent. “We are approaching operating conditions for which we have only very limited actual operating experience – and which occurred nearly 60 years ago,” the letter states. “We hope to be able to delay or avoid operational conditions below (3,490 feet) but we fully realize that absent a change in the recent hydrological conditions, we may not be able to avoid such operations.” Did you catch that? Interior is essentially saying that if we don’t get more snow (and that snow doesn’t produce more runoff), the best we may be able to do is delay the point at which Powell falls below 3,490 feet. In other words, we are once again being asked to sacrifice – not to fix the problem, but simply to buy time. If this feels like déjà vu, well, it is. We haven’t even fully implemented the 500-plus plan from December, in which the lower basin states of Arizona, California and Nevada agreed to store an additional 500,000 acre-feet of water in Lake Mead each year, simply to lower the risk of it tanking before 2026. That deal, which is only funded for the next two years but must persist through 2026 if we want to protect Lake Mead, essentially pays people not to use water. It’s not a solution. We’re simply buying time. And that’s on top of the mandatory cuts in the Drought Contingency Plan, which the lower basin states signed in 2019 – again, not to fix Mead’s problems, but to simply buy us time. Reclamation has already delayed the release of 350,000 acre-feet from Powell to Mead though the end of this month – a move that makes Powell appear about 7 feet higher than it otherwise would be. Its current elevation is 3,522 feet. It also is finalizing a Drought Response Operations Plan to protect Powell elevations – something the upper basin agreed to do in its version of the Drought Contingency Plan – potentially by moving more water from the smaller reservoirs upstream into Powell. Now, Interior is asking the basin states to accept a release of just 7 million acre-feet from Powell to Mead this water year, which ends in September, instead of the 7.48 million acre-feet we were expecting. That’s the smallest release since the river’s operational guidelines were created in 2007 – and the first time its operational tiers would be adjusted down to provide less water mid-year. Interior also says it wants to provide “additional certainty regarding annual release volumes and tier determinations for the 2023 water year.” How would that work? And how long would an extra 480,000 acre-feet last in Powell – without causing significant pain for Mead? The details have not been publicly discussed, but Interior has given states until April 22 to weigh in. This is a tenuous moment. Annual releases from Powell to Mead have always been a point of contention among the upper and lower basins. This could easily devolve into finger pointing over how we got into this shape or who should have done more to prevent it. Indeed, it’s an open question whether the states will submit a joint response agreeing to what Interior has proposed, or whether some might branch off if they don’t like the deal. As tempting as it is to get indignant or self-righteous about how much we’re already doing, it is in Arizona’s best interest to do more – even if it hurts, and yes, even if it doesn’t resolve anything. It would buy time to install new pipes for Page and the adjacent LeChee community and delay the risky venture of moving water through Powell’s bypass tubes. The consequences are probably far worse for Mead if we send water through those backup pipes and one of them fails than if we were to leave what might amount to about 8 feet of additional water in Powell. No, that does not make it a good idea. We are buying time in increasingly shorter durations, with heavier costs and fewer decent alternatives. This can’t continue for much longer. The guidelines for operating the river expire at the end of 2026. Yet state negotiators (and Reclamation) have spent most of their time and energy putting out these fires, not making headway on the issues that must drive a new set of rules, like how much water the Colorado River can realistically provide to states moving forward. If 7.5 million acre-feet – the annual amount guaranteed to each basin in the Colorado River compact – is no longer realistic, what is? If we don’t answer questions like this soon, there won’t be a Lake Powell (or a Lake Mead) to save. Reach Allhands at joanna.allhands@arizonarepublic.com. On Twitter: @joannaallhands.

4/15/2022,"CHISINAU (Reuters) - Moldova on Thursday accused Russia's army of trying to recruit Moldovan citizens, days after British military intelligence said that Moscow was trying to replenish its forces in Ukraine by recruiting in the breakaway Transdniestria region. Transdniestria is a narrow strip of land held by pro-Russian separatists that runs along the east of Moldova and comes to within about 25 miles (40 km) of the Ukrainian port of Odesa. ""Such actions do not promote peace for all of us, our fellow citizens, for our families. Such things are very dangerous and they must be stopped,"" Moldovan Foreign Minister Nicu Popescu said. He did not give further details but said that Moldovan foreign ministry officials regularly met Russia's ambassador and that Moldova's position on the matter was crystal clear. Moscow's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters was not able to immediately verify whether Russia's army has been trying to recruit Moldovans. Separately on Thursday, Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar said that Russia was massing troops in several areas including Transdniestria for a ""further escalation"" in Ukraine. Moldova said last month that it was monitoring the situation in Transdniestria, where an estimated 1,500 Russian troops are based, but that it had not seen significant changes since Russia's invasion of Ukraine started on Feb. 24. Transdniestria's authorities denied on Monday Russia was conducting any military preparations on its territory that threatened Ukraine. The region's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday about the remarks by Ukraine's Malyar. Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" to destroy Ukraine's military capabilities and root out what it views as dangerous nationalists, but Ukraine and the West say Russia launched an unprovoked war of aggression.

4/15/2022,"STORY: Russia warned on Thursday (April 14) that if Sweden and Finland join NATO, Russia would deploy nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles in an exclave in the heart of Europe. Both Finland, which shares an 810-mile border with Russia, and Sweden are considering joining the U.S.-led military alliance. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said that should Sweden and Finland join NATO then Russia would have to strengthen its land, naval and air forces in the Baltic Sea, where Russia has its Kaliningrad exclave sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. Medvedev also said he hoped Finland and Sweden would see sense, or they'd have to live with nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles close to home. There could be no more talk of a ""nuclear free"" Baltic, he said. One town on Finland’s border with Russia is Imatra, home to 26,000 people casting a nervous eye towards their eastern neighbor. It used to welcome Russian tourists, but since Moscow launched what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, Imatra fears receiving less benign arrivals. That worry has prompted Finland to consider joining NATO, which would be a major pivot in its security arrangements. Katri Latt is a resident of Imatra: ""We have so far seen Imatra as a very safe place and we still think so but I believe the thoughts of the people here have now changed in the way that a small fear has now appeared and Russia, the country next to us, is a little different to other countries and you cannot necessarily always trust what they say, so maybe people should be prepared for the fact that we might have to leave quickly.""

4/15/2022,"A Buddhist monk in Thailand drew criticism after local villagers found him drunkenly passed out and exposed in the local temple.

The 50-year-old monk, an unnamed former policeman, was found lying down on the balcony of a Buddhist temple in the Thai province of Nakhon Ratchasima on Tuesday afternoon.

Villagers found the monk fully exposed and surrounded by energy drinks and a bottle of Thai rice whisky with 40% alcohol content in his room.

They eventually brought his elderly mother to the temple to wake him up. After being scolded by his mother, the monk got in a pickup truck and drove away.

The monk, who reportedly had gotten drunk while celebrating the Thai New Year, found nothing wrong with the incident. While he admitted to getting intoxicated, he does not consider alcohol a problem and argued that he didn’t cause harm to others while under the influence.

Among the 227 rules that Buddhist monks in Thailand must follow, however, is the requirement that they cease drinking alcohol or becoming intoxicated by any means. Monks in Thailand are also not allowed to hold a driver’s license.

He has been ordained as a monk for four years now but has reportedly displayed similar behavior in the past, according to the villagers.

Elders in the village previously advised the monk to abandon his monkhood. They reportedly gathered evidence in the form of photos and videos of the most recent incident in an effort to request his monkhood be revoked.

4/15/2022,"(Please note language some may find offensive in paragraph 8) * Ukraine says ship damaged in missile strike * All crew evacuated - Interfax * Moskva missile cruiser usually has crew of 500 (Adds background, details) By David Ljunggren April 14 (Reuters) - The flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, the Moskva missile cruiser, was badly damaged when ammunition on board blew up, Interfax news agency quoted the defence ministry as saying on Thursday. The blast is yet another military setback for Russia, which has suffered a series of blows since invading Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what Moscow calls a ""special military operation"" to ""denazify"" the country. Interfax said all the crew had been evacuated. It cited the ministry as blaming the blast on a fire and said the cause was being investigated. A Ukrainian official earlier said the Moskva had been hit by two anti-ship missiles but did not give any evidence. The 12,500 tonne ship usually has a crew of around 500. ""As the result of a fire on the Moskva missile cruiser, ammunition detonated. The ship was seriously damaged,"" the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement. ""The crew was completely evacuated."" Russian news agencies said the Moskva, commissioned in 1983, was armed with 16 anti-ship ""Vulkan"" cruise missiles with a range of at least 700 km (440 miles). Interfax did not give more details of the incident. In April 2021, the agency quoted a retired Russian admiral as saying ""this is the most serious ship in the Black Sea"". Kyiv says the Moskva featured in one of the landmark early exchanges of the war, when Ukrainian border guards on Snake Island, a small outcrop in the Black Sea, told the ship to ""go fuck yourself"" after it demanded they surrender. Although Ukrainian officials initially said all 13 guards had died in the subsequent Russian attack, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy later said some of them survived. Maksym Marchenko, governor of the region around the Black Sea port of Odesa, earlier said the Moskva had been hit by two Ukrainian-made Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles, but did not provide evidence. ""It has been confirmed that the missile cruiser Moskva today went exactly where the border guards on Snake Island told it to go,"" he said in an online post. Ukraine's defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

4/15/2022,"DOBRA, Slovakia — Driving back to his village near the Ukrainian border last Thursday, the mayor had to stop to let a train pass, and assumed he wouldn’t have to wait long. But the flatbed wagons, stacked high with military equipment, just kept coming. He waited for nearly half an hour. “It was a very long train, much longer than usual,” recalled Mikolas Csoma, the mayor of Dobra, a previously sleepy village in eastern Slovakia that, over the past month, has become a key artery funneling weapons and ammunition into Ukraine by rail from the West. The train that delayed Csoma’s drive home was not only unusually long but also signaled a singular escalation in Western efforts to help Ukraine defend itself. It carried an air defense system made up of 48 surface-to-air missiles, four launchers and radars to guide the rockets to their targets, which in Ukraine means Russian warplanes and missiles. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times As President Vladimir Putin of Russia vows to fight the war to its “full completion” and his forces regroup for an expected push in Ukraine’s east, NATO countries, including the United States, are scrambling to keep the weapons flowing and bulk up the country’s defenses. Bolstering Ukraine’s long-range air defense capabilities is seen as especially critical. Ukraine already had its own S-300 and other air defense systems, but some of these have been destroyed, leaving Russia with a large degree of freedom to hit Ukrainian targets from the air with warplanes and cruise missiles. Increasingly desperate to reverse this imbalance, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine has repeatedly pleaded with NATO to “close the sky over Ukraine” by imposing a no-fly zone. But NATO has been unwilling to send its own warplanes into Ukraine. Instead, the United States offered Slovakia, a fellow NATO member, a substitute battery of U.S.-made Patriot missiles if it would “donate” its aging S-300 system to Ukraine. Jaroslav Nad, Slovakia’s defense minister and a gung-ho supporter of Ukraine, said it would have been unthinkable before Russia’s invasion for his country to send large quantities of even basic weapons across its eastern border free of charge, never mind an old but still powerful Soviet-made anti-aircraft system. “But this is the world’s new reality,” he said in Bratislava, the Slovak capital. “We are a front-line state. We have war on our border and more than 330,000 Ukrainians coming to our country. The paradigm is completely different now.” Putin, he said, “is equal to Hitler” and must be stopped in Ukraine before he can move further West. “Ukraine is literally fighting for our future,” he said. Like Slovakia, other countries are also steadily expanding the scope of their military aid. The No. 2 Pentagon official met in Washington on Wednesday with the United States' largest military contractors to discuss how ready they are to restock supplies and what new capabilities to send to Ukraine. The meeting and a new package of weapons, including artillery and ammunition, is intended in part by the Biden administration to blunt criticism that it is not doing enough for Ukraine and is too hesitant to send long-range weapon systems. Other NATO members are already sending Ukraine bigger and better weaponry than before, including T-72 tanks and short-range air defense systems from the Czech Republic. The S-300 system from Slovakia is the biggest item a NATO country has sent so far. It was previously deployed in Nitra, a city east of Bratislava at the other end of the country. From there, it was hauled by truck and train to Dobra, where the state-controlled rail yard has Soviet gauge tracks, wider than the standard in Europe, which means it can run trains to and from Ukraine, which also has Soviet tracks. Other big items now under discussion for transport to Ukraine via Slovakia include aging MiG-29 warplanes and sophisticated, self-propelled Howitzers called Zuzana 2. Also under review is a plan for Ukraine to send hundreds of damaged tanks, some of them captured from Russian forces, across the border for repair in Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland, all of which have experience fixing Soviet-made equipment. Slovakia “is not going to send tanks because we don’t have any spare tanks,” Nad said, underscoring an issue confronting even Ukraine’s most eager backers. “We have to keep enough capabilities for our own armed forces.” But Slovakia is transporting not only weapons from its own stocks into Ukraine. It is also sending military aid from many other countries, including the Czech Republic, Australia and what Nad described as “countries that claim that they are not sending military material to Ukraine.” Hungary, Slovakia’s southern neighbor, for example, has declared itself neutral in the conflict and barred weapons from passing through its own territory to Ukraine — largely to avoid upsetting deliveries of cheap Russian gas — but it is believed to have quietly provided weapons through other countries. Asked about this, a Hungarian government spokesperson in Budapest declined to confirm or deny that his country is providing military material, saying only that “Hungary’s standpoint is well known, and it has remained unchanged.” Alarmed by the flood of weapons flowing across the borders of Slovakia, Poland and Romania, Russia has sought to stop or at least slow it by declaring all foreign arms destined for Ukraine a “legitimate target.” Russia’s foreign minister vowed last month that Moscow “will not allow” the transfer of Slovakia’s S-300 air defense system. It is too late for that now, and after failing to thwart the delivery, the defense ministry in Moscow claimed on Sunday that Russia had already destroyed the Slovak missile system when sea-launched cruise missiles hit a hangar near the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Nad, the Slovak defense minister, dismissed this as a “fake news,” apparently aimed at saving Russia’s face and calming the nerves of Russian pilots sent on missions to bomb Ukraine. Nad said he had spoken with Ukraine’s defense minister on Monday and been assured that “this system is working and is working well” and was not in Dnipro. Previous military cargo sent into Ukraine by rail through Dobra and the nearby town of Cierna nad Tisou contained mostly ammunition and basic military hardware. A separate weapons conduit through Poland, the main route for American arms, has involved weapons like Javelin, NLAW and Stinger missiles, which are light, portable, high-tech and relatively easy to hide in trucks passing through Polish border crossings into western Ukraine. An air-defense battery is too big to hide, particularly when it travels on trains with more than 120 wagons in full view of drivers blocked by their passage. The cargo was so bulky it took two days to deliver it just a few miles from Dobra into Ukraine in two separate trains. “Everyone knows what is going on,” said Jakub Zsolt, a steel factory maintenance worker who lives across the road from the rail yard. He said his grandchildren were scared by all the commotion, but added that he had himself grown accustomed to the clatter of military helicopters and the rumble of trucks carrying weapons to the loading yard. All the same, he said, he worries that Slovakia, a small country of just 5.4 million people, is now wading too deeply into Ukraine’s war with Russia. “The Russians might attack us,” he said, adding that he did not understand why Ukrainians needed so much help when “they come here driving much nicer cars — Porsches and Mercedes — than we drive in Slovakia.” Most refugees fleeing the war, nearly all women and children, don’t drive anything, but cross on foot carrying just a change of clothes. Zsolt’s jaundiced view of Ukraine highlights the success of opponents of the pro-Western Slovak prime minister, Eduard Heger, who last week said, “We need to help Ukraine in every possible way to win this war.” His foes, playing to a substantial segment of the population traditionally favorable to Moscow, have sought to turn public opinion against support for Ukraine and seized on the war as a political opportunity. Robert Fico, a scandal-tainted former Slovak prime minister, upended the government’s efforts to keep the delivery of the S-300 battery secret until it had safely arrived in Ukraine when he posted a video on his Facebook page last Thursday that showed a train carrying the disassembled air-defense system on its way to Ukraine. He denounced Heger as “a freak in American hands who will do whatever the Americans tell him to do” and demanded that the public immediately be told where the S-300 system was going. Nad, the defense minister, said the delivery had been kept secret for security reasons. The opposition, he added, is playing “political games” against the interests of their own country and also Ukraine. “Russia is killing thousands of people in Ukraine and I am not going to count the votes that I would lose — or gain — based on the decisions of the government to help. The only thing that I am counting is the lives we can save in Ukraine,” he said. Pavel Macko, a retired Slovak general who served with NATO in Afghanistan and Germany, said the S-300 system delivered to Ukraine dated from the 1980s, when Slovakia was a member of the Warsaw Pact as part of Czechoslovakia, and was inferior to U.S.-made Patriot missiles. But, he added, Ukrainians know how to use it and will be able to reduce Russia’s mastery of the skies. “This is not just symbolic but an important addition that could help make Russia change their plans,” he said. The mayor in Dobra, Csoma, said he supported helping Ukraine, but was noncommittal when asked about the wisdom of sending a powerful weapon system like the S-300. Miffed not to be informed in advance about the disruption to traffic caused by the S-300 trains, he said: “They don’t tell me anything. They should at least let me know about this kind of thing.” Nobody really worried much about the war spreading into Slovakia, he said, but the authorities have nonetheless dusted off old civil defense plans, with police taking an inventory of potential bomb shelters. In the event of conflict, the mayor said, he had been assured that district authorities would send buses to evacuate his village’s 520 people. “If something bad happens, we will all leave,” he said. “So there is no panic yet.” © 2022 The New York Times Company",World/The New York Times,"Hiding in Plain Sight, a Soviet-Era Air Defense System Arrives in Ukraine",https://news.yahoo.com/hiding-plain-sight-soviet-era-182202931.html

4/15/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Western weaponry pouring into Ukraine helped blunt Russia's initial offensive and seems certain to play a central role in the approaching, potentially decisive, battle for Ukraine's contested Donbas region. Yet the Russian military is making little headway halting what has become a historic arms express. The U.S. numbers alone are mounting: more than 12,000 weapons designed to defeat armored vehicles, some 1,400 shoulder-fired Stinger missiles to shoot down aircraft and more than 50 million rounds of ammunition, among many other things. Dozens of other nations are adding to the totals. President Joe Biden on Wednesday approved another $800 million worth of military assistance, including additional helicopters and the first provision of American artillery. These armaments have helped an under-gunned Ukrainian military defy predictions that it would be quickly overrun by Russia. They explain in part why Russian President Vladimir Putin’s army gave up, at least for now, its attempt to capture Kyiv, the capital, and has narrowed its focus to battling for eastern and southern Ukraine. U.S. officials and analysts offer numerous explanations for why the Russians have had so little success interdicting Western arms moving overland from neighboring countries, including Poland. Among the likely reasons: Russia's failure to win full control of Ukraine's skies has limited its use of air power. Also, the Russians have struggled to deliver weapons and supplies to their own troops in Ukraine. Some say Moscow's problem begins at home. “The short answer to the question is that they are an epically incompetent army badly led from the very top,” said James Stavridis, a retired U.S. Navy admiral who was the top NATO commander in Europe from 2009 to 2013. The Russians also face practical obstacles. Robert G. Bell, a longtime NATO official and now a professor at the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs at Georgia Tech University, said the shipments lend themselves to being hidden or disguised in ways that can make them elusive to the Russians — “short of having a network of espionage on the scene” to pinpoint the convoys' movements. “It’s not as easy to stop this assistance flow as it might seem,” said Stephen Biddle, a professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University. “Things like ammunition and shoulder-fired missiles can be transported in trucks that look just like any other commercial truck. And the trucks carrying the munitions the Russians want to interdict are just a small part of a much larger flow of goods and commerce moving around in Poland and Ukraine and across the border. “So the Russians have to find the needle in this very big haystack to destroy the weapons and ammo they’re after and not waste scarce munitions on trucks full of printer paper or baby diapers or who knows what.” Even with this Western assistance it's uncertain whether Ukraine will ultimately prevail against a bigger Russian force. The Biden administration has drawn the line at committing U.S. troops to the fight. It has opted instead to orchestrate international condemnation and economic sanctions, provide intelligence information, bolster NATO's eastern flank to deter a wider war with Russia and donate weapons. In mid-March, a Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said arms shipments would be targeted. “We warned the United States that pumping weapons into Ukraine from a number of countries as it has orchestrated isn’t just a dangerous move but an action that turns the respective convoys into legitimate targets,” he said in televised remarks. But thus far the Russians appear not to have put a high priority on arms interdiction, perhaps because their air force is leery of flying into Ukraine's air defenses to search out and attack supply convoys on the move. They have struck fixed sites like arms depots and fuel storage locations, but to limited effect. On Monday, the Russians said they destroyed four S-300 surface-to-air missile launchers that had been given to Ukraine by an unspecified European country. Slovakia, a NATO member that shares a border with Ukraine, donated just such a system last week but denied it had been destroyed. On Tuesday, the Russian Ministry of Defense said long-range missiles were used to hit two Ukrainian ammo depots. As the fighting intensifies in the Donbas and perhaps along the coastal corridor to the Russian-annexed Crimean Peninsula, Putin may feel compelled to strike harder at the arms pipeline, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called vital to his nation's survival. In the meantime, a staggering volume and range of war materiel is arriving almost daily. “The scope and speed of our support to meeting Ukraine’s defense needs are unprecedented in modern times,"" said John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary. He said the approximately $2.6 billion in weapons and other material that has been offered to Ukraine since the beginning of the Biden administration is equivalent to more than half of Ukraine's normal defense budget. One example: The Pentagon says it has provided more than 5,000 Javelin missiles, which are among the world's most effective weapons against tanks and other armored vehicles — and can even take down a low-flying helicopter. The missile, shaped like a clunky dumb bell and weighing 50 pounds (23 kilograms), is fired by an individual soldier; from its launch tube it flies up at a steep angle and descends directly onto its target in what its known as a curveball shot — hitting the top of a tank where its armor is weakest. The Pentagon said Wednesday that an unspecified number of additional Javelins are to be delivered by Thursday, and the U.S. will complete the delivery of 100 armed Switchblade “kamikaze” drones this week. The specific routes used to move the U.S. and other Western materials into Ukraine are secret for security reasons, but the basic process is not. Just this week, two U.S. military cargo planes arrived in Eastern Europe with items ranging from machine guns and small arms ammunition to body armor and grenades, the Pentagon said. A similar load is due later this week to complete delivery of $800 million in assistance approved by Biden just one month ago. The weapons and equipment are offloaded, moved onto trucks and driven into Ukraine by Ukrainian soldiers for delivery. Kirby said the material sometimes reaches troops in the field within 48 hours of entering Ukraine.",World/Associated Press,Russia has yet to slow a Western arms express into Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-yet-slow-western-arms-041203366.html
4/15/2022,"Men should pay on first dates to check if their date is ""entitled,"" divorce lawyer Justin Lee said. It's the ""best litmus test"" for a partner, the Toronto-based family lawyer said on TikTok. The video sparked debate on dating etiquette and who should pay for dates. Men should always pay on first dates — but not for the reasons you might think. At least that's according to one Toronto-based divorce lawyer who think paying for dates is the perfect litmus test. When it comes to the best dating advice, science has you covered. ""The issue isn't tied to the number of dollars that we're spending at the end of the date,"" divorce lawyer Justin Lee said in a TikTok video that has more than 342,000 views. ""The issue is when we end up paying for someone who has this real sense of entitlement, like this expectation that we will pay. That's precisely why we need to always pay."" It's the ""best litmus test,"" he described in the caption.   ""Your date, whoever that is, may very well be the person you end up marrying. And trust me when I say, as a divorce lawyer, who you end up marrying is so, so important,"" he continued in the video. ""Let's say, at the end of the date, you pull out your wallet and you offer to pay. And your date just sits there, expecting you to pay, as if that is the obvious course of action,"" he said. ""You just learned that the person in front of you is entitled, and frankly, has the audacity to expect a near stranger to pay for them. Just imagine how someone like that would treat their significant other."" He added: ""For a low, low price of $20, $30, $40, you learned that the person in front of you does not have the basic courtesy to pretend to offer to pay. And therefore you should never go on another date with them."" Lee, who has 175,800 followers on TikTok, is a family law attorney working in Toronto, Canada. The video sparked discussions on dating etiquette, with some users saying that the person who asks for the date should be expected to pay. ""Counterpoint — for a first date, usually the woman has invested far more money (and time) into clothes, hair, makeup, etc — everything a man expects,"" a user wrote in a comment that got more than 1,600 likes. In the comments, Lee stressed that men will ""gladly pay"" because ""the payment isn't the issue."" ""The issue is when women perceive the payment as an obligation as opposed to a kind gesture. Entitled vs. appreciative. No one owes anybody anything!"" he wrote. ""For the record, this isn't gender specific — any man or woman who feels entitled in any way towards the other is a walking red flag,"" he added.

4/15/2022,"A fiery crash in Minnesota was caught on camera earlier this week. A driver lost control of a car while entering the highway and slammed into a box truck. The truck then careened across the road, into the rails of an overpass and burst into flames ― with some of the burning pieces falling onto the road below. “I figured if I went over the bridge that would have been the end of it,” truck driver Mitchell Moore told local ABC station KSTP. But the railing held and kept the truck from going over. The incident was captured by the state’s highway cameras: The footage shows the truck’s cab engulfed in flames and burning to practically nothing in a matter of minutes. Amazingly, no one was seriously injured. Police have not released the identity of the car’s driver, but told local NBC station KARE11 that the person “showed suspected signs of impairment” and is “being processed for driving while impaired.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.",U.S./HuffPost,Out-Of-Control Car Slams Into Truck In One Of The Wildest Wrecks You'll Ever See,https://news.yahoo.com/control-car-slams-truck-one-092638484.html
4/15/2022,"A former police officer who discussed Russia's invasion on the phone. A priest who preached to his congregation about the suffering of Ukrainians. A student who held up a banner with no words — just asterisks. Hundreds of Russians are facing charges for speaking out against the war in Ukraine since a repressive law was passed last month that outlaws the spread of “false information” about the invasion and disparaging the military. Human rights groups say the crackdown has led to criminal prosecutions and possible prison sentences for at least 23 people on the “false information” charge, with over 500 others facing misdemeanor charges of disparaging the military that have either led to hefty fines or are expected to result in them. “This is a large amount, an unprecedentedly large amount"" of cases, said Damir Gainutdinov, head of the Net Freedoms legal aid group focusing on free speech cases, in an interview with The Associated Press. The Kremlin has sought to control the narrative of the war from the moment its troops rolled into Ukraine. It dubbed the attack a “special military operation” and increased the pressure on independent Russian media that called it a “war” or an “invasion,” blocking access to many news sites whose coverage deviated from the official line. Sweeping arrests stifled antiwar protests, turning them from a daily event in large cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg into rare occurrences barely attracting any attention. Still, reports of police detaining single picketers in different Russian cities come in almost daily. Even seemingly benign actions have led to arrests. A man was detained in Moscow after standing next to a World War II monument that says ""Kyiv"" for the city's heroic stand against Nazi Germany and holding a copy of Tolstoy's “War and Peace.” Another was reportedly detained for holding up a package of sliced ham from the meat producer Miratorg, with the second half of the name crossed off so it read: “Mir"" — “peace” in Russian. A law against spreading “fake news” about the war or disparaging the military was passed by parliament in one day and took force immediately, effectively exposing anyone critical of the conflict to fines and prison sentences. The first publicly known criminal cases over “fakes” targeted public figures like Veronika Belotserkovskaya, a Russian-language cookbook author and popular blogger living abroad, and Alexander Nevzorov, a TV journalist, film director and former lawmaker. Both were accused of posting “false information” about Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine on their widely followed social media pages -– something Moscow has vehemently denied, insisting that Russian forces only hit target military targets. But then the scope of the crackdown expanded, with police seemingly grabbing anyone. Former police officer Sergei Klokov was detained and put in pretrial detention after discussing the war with his friends on the phone. His wife told the Meduza news site that in casual conversation at home, Klokov, who was born in Irpin near Kyiv and whose father still lived in Ukraine when Russian troops rolled in, condemned the invasion. Klokov was charged with spreading false information about the Russian armed forces and faces up to 10 years in prison. St. Petersburg artist Sasha Skochilenko also faces up to 10 years in prison on the same charge: She replaced price tags in a grocery store with antiwar flyers. On Wednesday, a court ordered Skochilenko to pretrial detention for 1 1/2 months. The Rev. Ioann Burdin, a Russian Orthodox priest in a village about 300 kilometers (about 185 miles) northeast of Moscow, was fined 35,000 rubles ($432) for “discrediting the Russian armed forces” after posting an antiwar statement on his church’s website and talking to a dozen congregants during a service about the pain he felt over people in Ukrain'e dying. Burdin told AP his speech elicited mixed reactions. “One woman made a scene over the fact that I’m talking about (it) when she just came to pray, ” he said, adding that he believed it was one of those hearing the sermon who reported him to the police. Marat Grachev, director of a shop that repairs Apple products in Moscow, similarly got in trouble when he displayed a link to an online petition titled, “No to war” on a screen in the shop. Many customers expressed support when they saw it, but one elderly man demanded it be taken down, threatening to report Grachev to the authorities. Police soon showed up, and Grachev was charged with discrediting the military. A court ordered him to pay a fine of 100,000 rubles ($1,236). Another court ruled against Moscow student Dmitry Reznikov for displaying a blank piece of paper with eight asterisks, which could have been interpreted as standing for “No to war” in Russian -- a popular chant by protesters. The court found him guilty of discrediting the armed forces and fined him 50,000 rubles ($618) for holding the sign in central Moscow in a mid-March demonstration that lasted only seconds before police detained him. “It’s the theater of the absurd,” his lawyer Oleg Filatchev told AP. A St. Petersburg court last week fined Artur Dmitriev for a sign containing President Vladimir Putin’s quote – albeit with a few words omitted for brevity – from last year’s Victory Day parade marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. “The war brought about so many unbearable challenges, grief and tears, that it’s impossible to forget. There is no forgiveness and justification for those who once again are harboring aggressive plans,” Putin had said, according to the Kremlin website. Dmitriev was fined 30,000 rubles for discrediting the Russian military. That prompted him to post Friday on Facebook: “The phrase by Vladimir Putin, and ergo he himself … are discrediting the goals of the Russian armed forces. From this moment on, (internet and media regulator) Roskomnadzor must block all speeches by Putin, and true patriots -– take down his portraits in their offices.” Net Freedoms' Gainutdinov said that anything about the military or Ukraine can make a person a target. Even wearing a hat with the blue and gold of the Ukrainian flag or a green ribbon, considered a symbol of peace, have been found to discredit the military, the lawyer added. Reznikov, who is appealing his conviction for the poster with asterisks, said he found the crackdown scary. After his first misdemeanor conviction, a second strike would result in criminal prosecution and a possible prison term of up to three years. Both Burdin and Grachev, who also are appealing, received donations that exceeded their fines. “I realized how important it is, how valuable it is to receive support,” Grachev said. Burdin said the publicity about his case spread his message far beyond the dozen or so people who initially heard his sermon — the opposite of what the authorities presumably intended by fining him. “It’s impossible to call it anything other than the providence of God,"" the priest added. ""The words that I said reached a much larger number of people.” —- Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,"Kremlin crackdown silences war protests, from benign to bold",https://news.yahoo.com/kremlin-crackdown-silences-war-protests-062956833.html
4/15/2022,"Seniors at two high schools in Alabama swapped schools for a day as a prank and were suspended by their administrators — a punishment they now say is too harsh , according to local media reports. More than a dozen seniors from Chilton County High School, in Clanton, and Jemison High School, in Jemison, attended classes at the opposite school’s campus on Monday, April 11, according to Al.com. The schools are located about 15 miles from one another, about 50 miles south of Birmingham.

 The students managed to attend half a day’s worth of classes before they were found out by school officials, according to AL.com. The prank, which students planned on Snapchat, resulted in three-day suspensions for multiple seniors, according to WVTM.

 “My scholarships are in jeopardy because of this,” Jemison High School senior Haileigh Greer told WBRC. She also told the outlet that she had been kicked off the school softball team. “I don’t mind the three day suspension. I understand,” Greer told WBRC. “But we shouldn’t have got kicked off the teams. I mean I have played softball since I was 8 and I got kicked off my senior year.” Neither the Chilton County Schools Board of Education nor the superintendent responded to a request for comment from McClatchy News. In a statement sent to WVTM13, superintendent Jason Griffin said “Chilton County schools follows law, policy and procedure in all aspects of day to day operations.” According to AL.com, Chilton County’s code of conduct largely leaves punishment decisions up to administrators, with pranks usually considered minor infractions but going to other campuses without permission being more serious.

A Change.org petition, which asks to stop the punishments for what it calls a “harmless” prank, was started on April 13 and has been signed by nearly 13,000 people as of the following afternoon.  Aaron Ellison, who identified himself as a Jemison High School alum on Facebook, wrote in a post that he supported the students. “I want to commend the 2022 senior classes from both schools for coming up with a prank that did not involve the destruction of property, the defacing of school property, did not cause any harm to anyone, and under any normal conditions would have been a laughable deed,” he wrote. “What this prank did do was expose security issues at both campuses. Is this the fault of the students? I think not!” Some local businesses also posted their support for students, including one with a discount themed for the class of 2022. “Hey Seniors, found yourself with an unexpected vacation from school this week?” Trendy Chic Boutique in Clanton, posted on Facebook. “Come shop with us and receive 22% off your purchase.” ‘Done playing with you idiots.’ NC teacher resigns after outburst caught on video Principal told girls to follow dress code or boys might touch them, students in WV say Teacher overwhelmed by response to her request for period products for Texas students",U.S./Biloxi Sun Herald,Seniors who switched high schools as prank in Alabama now say punishment is too harsh.,https://news.yahoo.com/seniors-switched-high-schools-prank-205351379.html

4/15/2022,"By Pavel Polityuk and Oleksandr Kozkukhar KYIV/LVIV, Ukraine, April 15 (Reuters) - Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv early on Friday, and air raid sirens blared across Ukraine as residents braced for new Russian attacks after Moscow's lead warship in the Black Sea sank following a fire. The explosions appeared to be among the most significant in Ukraine's capital region since Russian troops pulled back from the area earlier this month in preparation for battles in the south and east. Ukraine claimed responsibility for sinking the Moskva, saying the Soviet-era flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet was struck by one of its missiles. The vessel sank late on Thursday as it was being towed to port, Russia's defence ministry said. Over 500 crew aboard the missile cruiser were evacuated after ammunition on board exploded, the ministry said, without acknowledging an attack. Ukraine says it hit the warship with a locally made Neptune anti-ship missile. The ship's loss comes as Russia's navy continues its bombardment of Ukrainian cities on the Black Sea nearly 50 days after it launched the invasion. Residents of Odesa and Mariupol, on the adjacent Azov Sea, have been bracing for new Russian attacks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy alluded to the sunken warship in an early morning video address in which he warned of Russian intentions to target the eastern Donbas region, including Mariupol. Zelenskiy paid homage to all ""those who halted the progress of the endless convoys of Russian military equipment ... Those who showed that Russian ships can go ... down to the bottom."" There were no immediate reports of damage following the explosions reported in Kyiv, Kherson in the south, the eastern city of Kharkiv and the town of Ivano-Frankivsk in the west. Ukrainian media reported electricity outages in parts of Kyiv. Air raid sirens went off in all regions of Ukraine just after midnight on Friday and continued blaring in the eastern regions of Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia even after those elsewhere went quiet, Ukrainian media said. Reuters could not immediately verify the reports. MOSKVA Whatever the cause of the Moskva's loss, the episode is a setback for Russia. If Ukraine's assertion that it hit the ship in a missile strike turns out to be true, the attack will go down in history as one of the highest-profile naval attacks so far this century. Russia's defence ministry said it is investigating the cause of the fire on board. The United States said it did not have enough information to determine whether the Moskva was hit by a missile. ""(But) certainly, the way this unfolded, it's a big blow to Russia,"" said national security adviser Jake Sullivan. Russian forces have pulled back from some northern parts of Ukraine after suffering heavy losses and failing to capture Kyiv. Ukraine and its Western allies say Moscow is redeploying for a new offensive in the eastern Donbas region. Russia launched its assault in part to dissuade Ukraine from joining NATO. But the invasion has pushed Finland, which shares a long border with Russia, and nearby Sweden to consider joining the U.S.-led military alliance. Moscow warned NATO on Thursday that if Sweden and Finland join, Russia would deploy nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles in a Russian enclave on the Baltic Sea, in the heart of Europe. Commenting on Russia's military setbacks, CIA Director William Burns said the threat of Russia potentially using nuclear weapons in Ukraine cannot be taken lightly, but that the agency has not seen much practical evidence reinforcing that concern. BATTLE FOR MARIUPOL Moscow describes its invasion as a ""special military operation"" aimed at demilitarising Ukraine. Kyiv and its allies say Russia has launched an unprovoked war that has seen more than 4.6 million people flee abroad and killed or wounded thousands. Russia's navy has fired cruise missiles into Ukraine and its Black Sea activities are crucial to supporting land operations in the south and east, where it is battling to seize full control of Mariupol. Russia said on Wednesday that more than 1,000 Ukrainian marines from one of the units still holding out in Mariupol had surrendered. Ukrainian officials did not comment. If taken, Mariupol would be the first major city to fall to Russian forces since they invaded, allowing Moscow to reinforce a land corridor between separatist-held eastern Donbas areas and the Crimea region it seized and annexed in 2014. Ukraine said tens of thousands of people were believed to have been killed in Mariupol, where efforts were under way to evacuate civilians. Russia's defence ministry said late on Thursday that 815 people had been evacuated from the city over the past 24 hours. Ukraine said that figure was 289.
