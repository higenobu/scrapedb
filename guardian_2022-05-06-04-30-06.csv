5/6/2022,"The UK government has placed sanctions on Evraz, the multinational steelmaker part-owned by the billionaire Roman Abramovich that was formerly counted among Britain’s biggest companies. The Foreign Office said on Thursday that Evraz “operates in sectors of strategic significance to the government of Russia” and the action would “further chip away at Putin’s financial reserves and siege economy, and support Ukraine’s continued resistance”. Evraz’s registered office is in London’s Mayfair district, but it has vast mining and steelmaking operations in Russia, with more than 70,000 employees. The UK and allies including the US and EU have used sanctions on Russian companies and businessmen as one of the main tools to respond to the invasion of Ukraine. The Evraz measure is thought to be the first time a former FTSE 100 member has been subject to sanctions. It completes the fall from grace of a company that was valued at more than £5bn as recently as January. Its membership of the index meant that shares in the company were held by a wide variety of investors managing money for pensions, including BlackRock, Schroders Investment Management, Vanguard and Legal & General. Evraz shares were suspended from trading on the London Stock Exchange in March after the UK government highlighted its alleged strategic significance to Russia when imposing sanctions on Abramovich, who owns a 29% stake in the company. Its board also resigned after the sanctions against Abramovich. The government had in Abramovich’s sanctions designation alleged that Evraz was “potentially supplying steel to the Russian military which may have been used in the production of tanks”. This charge, which was strenuously denied by Evraz, was not included in the company’s sanctions designation on Thursday. In a statement in March, Evraz said it did not expect the company itself to be hit with sanctions because Abramovich did not have “effective control”. It also denied that its steel was used to build Russian tanks, saying it provided steel only to the “infrastructure and construction sectors”. However, Evraz signed a five-year deal in 2012 to supply railway wheels and “metal” to UralVagonZavod, a Russian company that is the world’s largest manufacturer of battle tanks and which makes T-72s and T-90s, both in service in Ukraine today. A person with knowledge of the contracts said they contained provisions limiting them to civilian use only. An Evraz spokesperson said: “Russia supplies long steel to infrastructure and construction sectors for civilian use only.” In its announcement on Thursday, the Foreign Office said: “Evraz plc produce 28% of all Russian railway wheels and 97% of rail tracks in Russia. This is of vital significance as Russia uses rail to move key military supplies and troops to the frontline in Ukraine.” It added that the new sanctions would “further deter companies operating in strategic sectors in Russia”. The sanctions include an asset freeze, meaning no UK citizen or company can do business with the firm. However, UK sanctions guidance suggests that companies subject to sanctions are usually allowed to pay employees and cover other “basic needs” such as rent, utilities or property management costs.",News/Business,UK imposes sanctions on Roman Abramovich-linked steel firm Evraz,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/05/uk-sanctions-steel-firm-evraz-russia-roman-abramovich
5/6/2022,"At least the Bank of England has stopped dancing around the idea that inflation will hit double digits this year. Back in March, the prospect wasn’t spelled out starkly; instead, there was a warning that the peak would be “several percentage points” higher than the 7.25% previously forecast. Now there’s no fudging: 10.2% is the official forecast for the fourth quarter of this year. And, frankly, the figure should surprise nobody who has been tracking wholesale energy prices and projections for household bills, where the open question is how close the price cap (currently £1,971, having been £1,277 at the start of this year) gets to £3,000 when it is next revised in October. The Bank used £2,800 in calculations, which was entirely reasonable since half the six-month measurement period for calculating the cap has already passed. That, though, was as far as the clarity in communication extends. The gloriously unclear part is Threadneedle Street’s plan to cope with 10% inflation, a sight not seen for 40 years. The pound sank two and half cents against the US dollar, which qualifies as a huge one-day movement and one that probably can’t be explained solely by the gloomy economic forecasts. A slice of the currency weakness may owe something to the confusion within the monetary policy committee about its next steps. Three members wanted to raise rates by a half-point immediately, yet two others thought it was “not appropriate” to sign up to a statement that said, gently, that “some degree” of further tightening in monetary policy might still be needed in coming months. Nobody should expect consensus on the MPC (and group-think would be terrible), but the gap between the doves and hawks has rarely looked so wide. A generous interpretation says that is because setting the correct policy framework is fiendishly difficult at present. Yet the decision-making won’t be made any easier if the pound keeps sliding, generating more imported inflation. The good(ish) news is that sterling’s performance against the euro, the more important currency from a trade perspective, has been nothing like as weak as against the dollar. But, at $1.2350 – Thursday’s late-afternoon price – sterling is now creeping perilously close to the $1.20 low from which it has bounced every time since the Brexit vote in 2016. One wouldn’t want to see it go lower than that. Having spent most of 2012 arguing that inflation would be transitory, the Bank now has a big communication job on its hands. Talk of a sterling crisis is grossly premature, but we don’t want to get close to that territory. A political and financial battle is raging behind the scenes for the right to host the flotation, or IPO, of Arm, the Cambridge-based chip designer that was bought by SoftBank of Japan in 2016. Or, more accurately, the UK is putting up a fight. The government and the London Stock Exchange are desperately keen to see Arm return to the London market, where, at £40bn-ish, it would be the biggest technology show in town. Over in the US, it’s hard to detect a lobbying overdrive. That is probably because Masayoshi Son, kingpin at SoftBank, has already indicated a preference for the Nasdaq stock exchange in the US – “the centre of global hi-tech”, as he called it. So Hermann Hauser, one of the key figures in Arm’s creation, didn’t do London any favours on Thursday by seeming to agree with Son that the US has more cachet and more liquidity in tech. On the other hand, Hauser also said this: “Arm is a UK company. It worked well with a dual listing before and I’m very much in favour of having a dual listing in London again.” The key point about a dual listing is that it never works if London plays second-fiddle. A standard listing, as opposed to the premium variety that qualifies for inclusion in FTSE indices, gets ignored if New York is seen as the primary venue. But the set-up can work in reverse. US investors are happy to own US depositary receipts in large FTSE 100 companies. London should also shout about the happy existence on the Amsterdam exchange of ASML, the Dutch maker of machines central to the progress of the semiconductor industry. ASML is worth $200bn and shows that you can be very big in tech outside the US. London remains the rank outsider in the race for Arm, but it should keep pushing.",News/Business,"The fudging is over, as monetary policy committee predicts 10.2% inflation | Nils Pratley",https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/may/05/the-fudging-is-over-as-monetary-policy-committee-predicts-102-inflation
