2/8/2022,"My friend Michael Wilson, who has died aged 79, was a linguist who used his skills to enable British ornithologists to access works unavailable in English. Mike and I grew up in Somerset villages separated by the Mendip Hills. Our mutual passion for birds absorbed our time and energy in our teenage years. He excelled at identifying bird calls as he walked the Somerset levels. If he heard an unfamiliar call or song he would doggedly wait, listen, search and commit it to memory.  At 15 our bikes took us to search for a little bittern in some reedbeds beside the A38. We stayed in a truck drivers’ lodge in a dormitory room full of snoring men, to be on site at first light for the best chance to see the elusive bird. Mike was wonderful company, considerate, thoughtful and a prolific note-taker. After O-levels at the Blue school, Wells, in the long hot summer of 1959 we hitched to Scotland with an old Army bivouac to see the first successful nesting of an osprey at Loch Garten. We joined the watch rota set up by the RSPB to look out for egg thieves and record the birds’ feeding behaviour. Mike was the first to eat part of a trout dropped by an incoming bird that we recovered from below the nest. Supervising, Peter Conder, later the RSPB chief executive, fried it up in a pan. Such bonding sealed a lifelong friendship. In the 1970s Mike joined my family’s holidays in the birding hotspots of Cley, Dungeness and the Isles of Scilly. Born in the hamlet of Keward, near Wells, Mike was the son of Violet Hutchinson and Walter Wilson, a dealer in vintage cars who did electrical work for EMI in Wookey. At the Blue school, he was drawn to languages and studied German and Russian at Edinburgh University in 1963. That led to posts teaching English in Minsk and Voronezh, where he got to know many Russian ornithologists. While teaching at Sherborne school and at Hedley Walter school, Brentwood, Mike joined an editorial team under Stanley Cramp, the chief editor of The Birds of the Western Palearctic (BWP), volunteering to translate bird literature from German and Russian. In 1980 he became a full-time team member in the Alexander Library of the Edward Grey Institute, Oxford, to research, write and edit BWP volumes 3-9. It was a joy in 2019 to see Mike receive the Janet Kear Union Medal from the British Ornithologists’ Union in recognition of his distinguished service to ornithology. He is survived by his sister, Penny.",News/Environment,Michael Wilson obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/07/michael-wilson-obituary
2/8/2022,"US lawmakers asked the Internal Revenue Service to “halt its plans” to use facial recognition technology on millions of Americans who use the agency’s website to pay taxes or access documents. Citing privacy and security concerns, Democratic lawmakers on Monday said they were “deeply concerned” about the IRS’s deal with ID.me, the face-recognition company that promises to verify taxpayers’ identities with a selfie.  “Millions of Americans use the IRS website annually for a variety of vital functions, and, as a result, each of them will be forced to trust a private contractor with some of their most sensitive data,” the lawmakers, Ted Lieu, Anna Eshoo, Pramila Jayapal and Yvette Clarke, said in a letter. “We urge the IRS to halt this plan and consult with a wide variety of stakeholders before deciding on an alternative.” The lawmakers demanded that the agency pause its plans until it addresses concerns raised by Congress and consults with stakeholders in the civil rights and civil liberties communities. Digital rights groups warn using facial recognition systems for identity verification when filing taxes raises myriad privacy and discrimination issues. Studies have shown both technologies ID.me uses in its identity fraud and verification processes – face-matching and facial recognition systems – often misidentify Black and brown faces. The use of such technologies alsocreates a massive database of information that can be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks or shared with other government entities. Among the personal data the company is collecting are users’ images, “inferred citizenship” based on passport information, voiceprints, location data, addresses, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, passport-card numbers and more. ID.me said it only shares this user information with government entities in response to a subpoena or other legal request or in the case of an identity theft investigation. “If they switch to another company, a lot of the issues will be the same,” said Caitlin George, Fight for the Future campaign director. “The number of problems just outweigh the benefits. And that’s why we don’t think it should be used at all.” Lieu said that the IRS has failed to justify why it needs to give a third-party contractor access to the biometric data of millions of Americans. “I could do banking transactions right now, without having to have facial recognition. Why does the IRS need to have facial recognition to allow Americans to simply use their portal?”",News/US news,US lawmakers urge IRS to halt plan to use facial recognition on millions of taxpayers,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/07/us-lawmakers-urge-irs-halt-plan-facial-recognition-millions-taxpayers
2/8/2022,"My friend Stephen Trudgill, who has died aged 74, was an emeritus fellow of Robinson College, Cambridge, whose work often focused on the interaction of nature with people. Unfortunately Steve died just before the release of his book, Why Conserve Nature?, which examines the varied meanings of nature, climate change, ecological science and nature in literature and art. It should be published shortly.  Described by one friend as a “hippy contrarian”, he pursued certain key themes throughout his career. These he characterised as the “personal meanings of nature, especially the therapeutic aspects in wilderness, nature reserves and gardens, as well as the psychological importance of nature to our wellbeing”. He had a generous and kind nature that was appreciated by generations of students and dons, as well as his neighbours (of which I was one) in the Cambridgeshire village of Hinxton. His slightly stooped frame was a familiar sight in the gardens of Robinson College – he was chair of its gardens committee – and he was often seen checking the footpaths around Hinxton, where he served on the parish council for 23 years. Steve was born in Norwich, where his father, John, was a publisher and artist, and his mother, Hettie (nee Gooch), worked in the Jarrold & Sons department store. After Thorpe grammar school he went to Bristol University, where he had wanted to study botany as well as geography and geology but – because the timetable precluded it – reluctantly took sociology as his third subject. After graduation in 1968, he gained his PhD on the geomorphology of Aldabra Atoll in the Indian Ocean, where he spent several months in 1972. His lecturing began at the University of Strathclyde, before he moved to the University of Sheffield, where he taught soils, biogeography and geomorphology for 20 years. Steve then joined Robinson College in 1996, becoming its first resident geography director of studies and making geography one of the college’s best established subjects. It was at Robinson that his reluctantly undertaken sociology studies proved their worth as he expanded his interest from physical geography to the psychological and social aspects of environmental perception and environmental management. These elements all came together in his course on the social engagement of nature. Outside his university work, Steve was especially proud of the time he spent as a member of the executive committee of the Field Studies Council, helping young people access the countryside. He had a restless curiosity that was reflected not only in his professional life but in many other interests, including as a gardener, birdwatcher, opera lover and amateur artist. He is survived by his brother, Peter.",News/Science,Stephen Trudgill obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/07/stephen-trudgill-obituary
2/8/2022,"The wait for Britain’s first gold medal at these Winter Olympics goes on, but Team GB has become a surprise success off the snow and ice after its opening ceremony kit became a sensation on Weibo, the most widely used social media platform in China. Reaction to the British team, who wore a Ben Sherman duffle coat and Chelsea boots during the ceremony, reached No 8 on the Weibo Hot Topic section, with the Olympics and the start of the Chinese lunar new year the most popular.  Footage of their entrance to the Bird’s Nest stadium hasbeen viewed more than 500,000 times. Such has been the reaction the British embassy has been asked by their followers in China to run a competition to win the kit. Many Weibo users spoke approvingly of the stylishness of the attire , although others wondered whether the athletes were feeling cold in temperatures that dipped well below freezing. “Everyone else was wearing a down jacket, only Team GB wearing a coat,” said one comment. “This is so English. But really, are you guys not cold?” said another. One user likened the coat to the Hogwarts school uniform. Meanwhile, Team GB have revealed they took equipment to build separate gyms in their three training bases in China – including six Olympic lifting areas, kettlebells, Watt bikes and ski Ergs – as part of a plan to mitigate Covid risk. No British athlete has tested positive for Covid in Beijing, something that would require them facing a spell in a quarantine hotel until they cleared two negative tests over two days. As part of a plan to make the 50 British athletes feel more welcome, the British Olympic Association has also shipped 3,200 teabags, 160 tins of baked beans, 160 bottles of blackcurrant, apple and orange juice, 40 Smart TVs and 15 Brompton bikes.",Sport/Sport,Team GB prove a hit with China in the Winter Olympic fashion stakes,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/07/team-gb-winter-olympic-fashion-stakes-ben-sherman-chelsea-boots
2/8/2022,"Britain has agreed to send a further 350 troops to Poland, in a move intended to demonstrate that the two countries stand together amid concerns that the Ukraine crisis could spill over into eastern Europe. The deployment was agreed bilaterally – meaning it takes place outside Nato’s structures – and comes a few days after the US announced it would send in 1,700 paratroop reinforcements into Poland.  Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, standing next to his Polish counterpart in London, said the aim was to send a “strong signal” to Russia that the UK and Poland “stand side by side” as Moscow moves up to 30,000 troops to neighbouring Belarus. Mariusz Błaszczak, the Polish defence minister, said he wanted the deployment to take place “as soon as possible” and that he intended the troops would be based “east of the Vistula river”, which runs through the heart of the country. Poland borders both Ukraine and Belarus to the east. Russia has begun sending thousands of troops into Belarus for military exercises this month, which the US and the UK fears could be used as the basis for an invasion of Ukraine – or they may end up being permanently stationed in the country. It is part of wider buildup of an estimated 130,000 Russian troops near Ukraine’s borders. Over the weekend US officials warned that Russia had assembled around 70% of the force needed to attempt an invasion of its smaller neighbour. Labour said it welcomed the deployment, but said “UK leadership has been missing from the top-level diplomacy required” because Boris Johnson has been fighting to survive as prime minister. The party called on ministers to reverse a planned reduction of about 9,500 in the target size of the UK armed forces. “With threats increasing and growing Russian aggression, ministers must halt their plans to cut the army,” the shadow defence secretary, John Healey, said. Britain already has 250 soldiers in Poland, 150 of whom are part of an existing Nato multinational protection force, and 100 of whom are engineers helping Warsaw to strengthen its borders with Belarus. Details about which forces would be sent out were not initially available, a sign that the agreement had been hastily put together and signed off at a meeting between Wallace and Błaszczak at the Ministry of Defence in London. But a few hours after the agreement was announced, the MoD said 350 Royal Marines would fly out to Poland “in the coming days”. British sources indicated the extra forces would not amount to a permanent deployment in Poland. But the UK has already signalled it is willing to base extra forces in eastern Europe, offering to double its commitment to Estonia, where 900 British forces lead a Nato battlegroup. The fact that the agreement was brokered directly between the two countries suggests that Warsaw is anxious about the growing Russian presence in Belarus, which Nato says includes Iskander missiles with a range of up to 500km (300 miles), and S-400 air defence systems. The first US troops, paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne, from the recently announced deployment arrived in Poland over the weekend. Another 4,500 US forces are already in the country as part of Nato and bilateral missions. Further decisions on long-term deployments in eastern Europe are expected to be discussed at a meeting of Nato defence ministers on 16-17 February. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s general secretary, said at a press conference in Brussels with Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda: “We are considering more longer-term adjustments to our posture, our presence in the eastern part of the alliance. No final decision has been made on that, but there is a process now going on within Nato.”",News/Politics,UK to send troops to Poland amid concern about Russian buildup ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/07/uk-to-send-troops-to-poland-amid-concern-about-russian-buildup
2/8/2022,"For Luke Garrard, it was all about creating a moment, a rush of joy, something to remember for ever and, given the odds against his Boreham Wood team in the FA Cup fourth round at Bournemouth on Sunday, the manager would have taken anything – and especially a goal. Garrard got that and what a story it was for the captain, Mark Ricketts, at 37 years young, when he threaded home a low sidefoot on 38 minutes to give the National League side the lead. Ricketts had not trained from Tuesday to Friday and he did the bare minimum on Saturday as he nursed an injury that needed an injection last Monday.  “Mark was still feeling it after the session on Saturday,” Garrard says. “I said: ‘I don’t care. You’re walking us out at Bournemouth. I don’t care if it’s 15 minutes or 20 minutes. You deserve that.’” Garrard wanted the moment for his players, particularly the stalwarts such as Ricketts; for the fans; for the chairman, Danny Hunter, who has done everything since his takeover in 1999 and, yes, for himself. Why not? “When we scored the first goal, I would probably have taken a 5-1 loss … just to have a moment,” Garrard says. Garrard and everybody connected to the club ended up with so much more and the scenes after the final whistle, when little Boreham Wood had hung on to win 1-0 and set up a fifth-round tie at Everton, featured plenty of people taking leave of their senses. At 11pm the previous night, Garrard had received a FaceTime call from a member of the club’s staff who was already in Bournemouth at a hotel. “There were 30 or 40 fans [outside the hotel] and they were singing my name … incredible,” he says. After 17 years at Boreham Wood, initially as a player and as the manager since October 2015, his bond with the support is unbreakable. Garrard was in tears at full time, partly because he had his wife and two young sons at the stadium, along with other family members and friends. He stayed back at first to allow the players to celebrate in front of the away end but, a little later, he had his moment alone with them. There was a touch of the Jürgen Klopps about his fist pump and their cheers. Boreham Wood, whose players are full-time professionals, have earned roughly £240,000 in prize money from the Cup run. They collected £110,000 in TV money from the Bournemouth tie and, when their shares of gate receipts are factored in, it is believed they have made about £500,000 – with more to come at Everton, particularly if it is televised. “This will fill a small void in a big black hole,” Garrard says, as he reflects on the impact of the pandemic on the club. “But I’ll tell you now that the chairman would pay half a million to have a moment like this. Because he’s saying that he’s coming towards the later stages of his life. “Money is money. He says it to me every time. Don’t worry about the money. He never puts pressure on me to go on a Cup run. But to create those moments …” Garrard is asked whether he shared a moment with Hunter after the match. “I’ve made a fat man happy,” he says, smiling. “And that’s not me … I sound so rude. He says it in his interviews. ‘You make a fat man happy.’” He can be familiar with Hunter, he can poke fun, because they are so tight. “It’s not a chairman-manager relationship. He calls me his sixth son. I just love the man. “There is a pandemic but he paid everyone at the club 100%. He gave everyone £100 a week to pay for their [online] food shopping so they wouldn’t have to go to the supermarkets and risk bringing Covid back to their homes. I was getting unbelievable steak every week. He remortgaged his house [in March 2020 to put the money into the club].” Garrard was impressed by the Bournemouth manager, Scott Parker, who came into the dressing room to congratulate them. “I have to say: ‘Who does that?’” Garrard says. “For him to have that about him after a defeat is incredible.” He has asked Parker whether he can shadow him in training for four or five days at some point. So now for Everton. Now for Frank Lampard and his assistant manager, Ashley Cole. “I’m an Arsenal man so to see Ashley Cole … I probably won’t know how to put two words together,” Garrard says. “Frank Lampard is an England legend, a Chelsea legend. But I’ll be asking him the same thing I did with Scott Parker. ‘Can I come in and shadow you?’ He’s unbelievable. Hopefully he keeps the score under 10. “My players deserve this. They deserve to walk out at Goodison and hear the [Z Cars] music. The hair on the back of my neck has just gone up thinking about the music.” The Boreham Wood story has got all the ingredients for a film so perhaps the nearby Elstree Studios should give it some thought. “That’s nice,” Garrard says. “I’ll have Brad Pitt. He can play me.”",Sport/Football,‘My players deserve this’: Boreham Wood turn focus to Lampard’s Everton,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/07/boreham-wood-lampard-everton-fa-cup-bournemouth
2/8/2022,"The Today programme presenter Justin Webb has been partially rebuked by the BBC after he suggested students were lying when they accused a university professor of transphobia. Introducing Radio 4’s newspaper review last October, Webb said: “And quite a lot of coverage still of Kathleen Stock, the academic from Sussex University who’s been abused by students who accuse her, falsely, of transphobia. She says her union has now effectively ended her career. It’s published a statement of support, not for her but for those who are abusing her.”  Four listeners complained to the BBC that Webb’s use of “falsely” was inaccurate and betrayed a personal opinion. Three also complained of inaccuracy and apparent bias in describing the students who had been protesting against Stock as “abusing her”. Stock left her position as a philosophy professor at the University of Sussex at the end of last year after protests over her views on gender identification and transgender rights. She said she had no choice but to resign after protests from students and opposition from fellow academics. The BBC’s editorial complaints unit ruled that Webb was not sufficiently accurate when he suggested the accusation of transphobia against Stock had been disproved. This was because the “validity or otherwise of the accusation of transphobia are the heart of the controversy”. However, the BBC rejected listener complaints that Webb or the Today programme staff breached impartiality rules by expressing their personal opinions on a controversial subject. Instead, they said the word “falsely” was used by the presenter because he was introducing a summary of a Spectator article by Julie Bindel that was supportive of Stock and criticised “extreme transgender ideology”. The BBC complaints unit also ruled Webb’s description of the student protesters as abusive was accurate because some of the language they had used was “incontestably abusive, irrespective of the merits of the arguments”. Among those who filed complaints to the BBC was Freddy McConnell, a transgender journalist who recently lost his legal battle to register as his child’s father. The public broadcaster has increasingly struggled with how to cover transgender issues, with editorial clashes between staff in the newsroom as well as rolling criticism on social media of specific articles. Last year the BBC withdrew from a diversity scheme run by the LGBT charity Stonewall that provided guidelines on running an inclusive workplace. Executives said that although it did not believe membership of the scheme compromised its impartiality, the perception that it could do so was causing problems for the BBC. At the time the BBC director general, Tim Davie, said his organisation was committed to providing a safe space but insisted “our journalism must be impartial and reflect a range of views” on policy debates such as changes to the law around transgender issues.",News/Media,BBC rebukes Justin Webb over comment on Kathleen Stock row,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/07/bbc-rebukes-justin-webb-over-comment-on-kathleen-stock-row
2/8/2022,"It seems a lifetime ago now that Camilla Parker Bowles was a scarlet woman, a mistress so reviled some felt she would never be accepted by the public. This week it was announced that she will become Queen consort when her husband becomes king, in what felt like the final reward for years of being a Good Wife; the kind who supportively, unselfishly and discreetly enables her husband to become the best version of himself. As an anonymous royal source told the Daily Mail approvingly, Camilla saw her job as doing whatever she was asked to do: “You don’t try to shape the role to your advantage. It’s about duty and service.” And if it’s taken three solid decades of self-effacement to transform her from hate figure to national treasure – well, nobody said being a Good Wife was easy, or indeed fun. Carrie Johnson has certainly found it hard going, judging by a new biography from the Tory peer Lord Ashcroft in which her critics portray her as the wrong kind of wife entirely; too meddlesome, too “woke”, too insistent on her husband changing the odd nappy, and altogether too unlike her predecessor, Marina Wheeler, who made his life run so smoothly that he didn’t have to worry about anything (and was duly rewarded for her efforts by being repeatedly cheated on). Poor Boris needs “mothering”, we’re told, not someone nagging him about net zero. Setting aside the fact that portraying the prime minister as a needy manchild does him no favours, the trouble with this reductive nonsense is that as an explanation for his current misfortunes, it simply doesn’t wash.  Wheeler was not some surrendered wife content with reverently rearranging her husband’s sock drawer, but a leading QC and committed Brexiter who argued trenchantly in the run-up to the referendum for curtailing the influence of the European court of justice, and was widely credited with persuading her wobbling husband to back Brexit. (Wifely influence can be surprisingly acceptable in Tory circles, so long as it’s in the “right” direction.) Carrie Johnson, meanwhile, may well have been guilty of using the network she once developed as a special adviser to steer her husband’s government in her preferred direction, but she has become a lightning rod for unfair criticism and downright misogyny. Downing Street can be a lonely place for spouses, but perhaps particularly one dealing in quick succession with the near-death of her husband, two births, a miscarriage and rumours that he might be pining for the last wife, all while trying to find her footing on a very public tightrope. It’s too easy to blame every controversial decision, intragovernment tension or inexplicable U-turn on her whispering in the prime ministerial ear, when all too often the problem is his own ideological slipperiness and strategic preference for chaos. Just as it did in the days of Camilla being pitted against Diana, setting two wives against each other conveniently obscures the role of the man stood between them. All successful marriages are partnerships, and in politics that’s perhaps unusually true. David Cameron would have been a different man without Samantha shaking up some of his assumptions; Theresa May drew confidence from rock-steady Philip. But it is prime ministers who set the direction of their governments and the culture inside Downing Street. Johnson’s hatred of personal confrontation, learned in childhood, leaves him wanting to be all things to all people. While this fuzziness is electoral catnip – who else could have persuaded so many starkly different groups of voters in 2019 that he was simultaneously on all their sides? – it is no recipe for clear leadership internally. Those who have worked for him describe a secretive man, who in an argument leaves both sides with the impression he agrees with them before reneging on one the minute he leaves the room. As prime minister, he is forced daily into making hard choices that reveal either his true convictions or strange lack of them, while the glib half-truths to which he resorts when cornered are quickly exposed. None of that is his wife’s fault. The strengths and weaknesses Johnson exhibits as prime minister are the same strengths and weaknesses evident throughout his career. And to the extent that Carrie has power over his decisions, it can only be the power he allows her to have. Like blaming a mistress for the breakup of a marriage, blaming a wife for a politician’s failures obscures the fact that he’s the one who made a vow to the country – and the one ultimately responsible for sticking to it.

2/8/2022,"There is a long and inglorious history in racing of individual bodies or businesses opting for short-term gain ahead of the broader interests of the sport. But even so, the Jockey Club’s decision to sign a five-year deal with the gaming giant, Playtech, which was announced last week, feels like a new low. The result, according to Playtech’s casino director, James Frendo, will be “a full range of exceptional and exciting cross-product content”. Or the Jockey Club flogging Playtech some racing-themed wrapping paper for software that mechanically grinds a fixed percentage of turnover from its users, depending on your point of view.  And of all the moments to jump into bed with a gaming company, they have done it now, just before a government White Paper with proposals for reform of the gambling laws which could have a profound impact on the sport’s revenue stream from betting. The ideas that have been floated to reduce gambling-related harm include a blanket ban on advertising, “affordability” checks before customers are allowed to deposit or gamble, which would require punters to hand over extensive banking and financial details to a new regulator, and a monthly cap on gambling “spend” of as little as £100. Where the policy-makers eventually decide to draw the lines remains to be seen, but it has often been compared to a choice between regulating gambling like alcohol, or much more strictly, like tobacco. Racing can cope with the former, but it would on a long, slow slide towards oblivion if the government opts for the latter. The fundamental differences between betting, where the odds are fluid and punters can win, and gaming, where the fixed margin is unbeatable, were appreciated and understood by legislation until the 2005 Gambling Act blurred the distinction. The big off-course firms – which had built their brands on betting – were delighted, and they spent the next 15 years raking in billions from gaming machines in “betting” shops until the maximum stake was finally cut from £100 to £2 in April 2019.

This led to what is now a fairly standard business model across the industry. First, use big racing and sporting events, like the Jockey Club’s crown jewel at Cheltenham next month, to sign up new accounts. Next, use profiling to weed out anyone who promises to be “uneconomic” – they can tell within three bets, apparently. And then push as many of the remainder as possible towards the gaming side of the business, via “free” spins and so on. It is grubby and cynical, and also highly effective. It deters punters from betting on racing – what’s the point if they restrict you the instant you have a decent win? – and, perhaps most concerningly of all, pushes potential problem gamblers towards casinos and slots, where the rapid-fire spin rate could be seen as addictive by design. No one is suggesting that betting, on racing or anything else, is entirely safe for all gamblers, and that needs regulating too. But the problem-gambling rate associated with slots and gaming products is significantly higher. As the Gambling Commission pointed out in 2020, “activities that permit high-frequency participation are more likely to be associated with harm and more readily facilitate problematic behaviour, such as loss-chasing.” The best outcome for racing from the latest review of the gambling laws would be alcohol-style regulation for betting and a tobacco-style regime for gaming. That would require, for instance, complete separation between the betting and gaming sides of a firm’s operation, including separate licenses and sites as well as a blanket ban on cross-promotion. The penalty for any breach would be suspension or loss of the firm’s gaming licence, which would help to focus the compliance department’s attention on the importance of sticking to the rules. Nor is there any obvious reason why the real-world £2 maximum spin on the slots should not apply online too. To reach that point, or somewhere close to it, racing needs to argue for as much regulatory blue water as possible between betting and gaming, and ideally to do so with one voice. Few events demonstrate the difference between betting and its drab, soulless distant cousin quite like Cheltenham, where everything from the backdrop to the wild uncertainty and intensity of the competition adds to the experience. And yet the Jockey Club is willing to hawk the Festival’s name and reputation to a gaming company in return for … well, probably rather more than 30 pieces of silver, but a miserable, unworthy sum all the same. That is the same Jockey Club, let’s not forget, which operates under a Royal Charter that requires it to act for “the long-term good of British racing”. Charlie Boss, the Jockey Club’s chief commercial officer, said last week that “we did some very serious due diligence into the player safety capabilities [at Playtech] and what they offer there.” That they were willing to consider a deal in the first place, however, suggests that they either get the difference between betting and gaming but do not think it really matters, or they do not understand it all. It is 10-11 each of two on which would be the deeper cause for concern. They either get the difference between betting and gaming but do not think it really matters, or they do not understand it all.

2/8/2022,"The discovery of a soundproofed torture chamber believed to have been used by a narcotics gang should remind recreational cocaine users of the consequences of their habits, a Dutch public prosecutor has said. Koos Plooij told a court in Amsterdam that the violence of the drug trade was a “repulsive, but apparently unavoidable” result of the widespread use of illegal drugs in the Netherlands and its neighbouring countries.  “The question is how many people are willing to admit that there is indeed a connection between their cocaine use – whether it is to party, deal with work stress or suppress psychological problems – and the underworld that is happy to answer demand but according to its own rules: corrupting, undermining, tough, sparing nothing and nobody,” Plooij said. The comments were made at the latest hearing in the case of 11 suspects, including an alleged ringleader known as Roger “Piet Costa” P, who are accused of planning to murder rivals at an apparent torture site in Wouwse Plantage in Brabant. Two years ago, police officers, acting on intercepted messages, discovered seven shipping containers in Wouwse Plantage in Brabant, six of which were allegedly used as cells containing handcuffs and legcuffs. In the seventh container was a refashioned dentist’s chair, with straps for tying arms and legs, finger clamps, scalpels, claw hammers, pliers, loppers, pruning shears, gas burners, tie wraps and duct tape. The container was sound proofed. Officers also found a freezer large enough to hold more than one person and a mortar mixing tub which was allegedly going to be used for waterboarding victims. The court heard that a second site in Rotterdam was the operating base for an “arrest team” whose task was to pick up their intended targets and take them to the site in Wouwse Plantage. Prosecutors provided the court with an intercepted message from the suspect known as Piet Costa in which he wrote, “There are a few now and I hope I get the chance to torture them”. A second man, who is terminally ill and not currently on trial, allegedly wrote: “If they don’t cooperate, right in the knee”. The court heard that the wives and children of the alleged gang’s rivals were also in danger of being targeted and “detained under the most barbaric conditions”. In both sites, officer found stolen police uniforms, bulletproof vests and blue flashing lights. Prosecutors called for a 12-year jail sentence for Roger P, known as Piet Costa, who is already facing a jail sentence of 17 years and nine months sentence over a separate conviction. He has been described as a major figure in the drug world.

2/8/2022,"Pupils who were sent home to learn remotely during lockdown may no longer feel the same need to turn up for school, according to an Ofsted report, which also cites parents requesting online lessons for their children during term-time holidays. The report comes after an investigation into low attendance in schools, which found the switch to online lessons had “negatively affected” some secondary school pupils’ perceptions of the need to be in school and could be contributing to high absence rates.  Some parents who felt their children had learned well using remote lessons wanted to continue, while others whose children have a history of poor attendance used “possible Covid” as an excuse for absence, sometimes resulting in 10 days off school without a confirmatory PCR test. Others had apparently misunderstood the role of online lessons. “Some parents think that remote education can be provided for non-Covid-related circumstances, such as being on holiday, which leaders have to explain is not the case,” the report says. According to the latest government statistics, attendance in state-funded schools fell to 87.4% on 20 January, with 415,000 pupils off for Covid-related reasons. Pre-pandemic, the overall absence rate in 2018-19 was 4.7%. The report, published by the schools watchdog on Monday, confirmed that the most common reason for higher than normal absences was pupils having Covid, but parents’ and pupils’ anxieties were also having an impact, as well as the shift in attitudes to school among some young people. It also found that some parents were keeping children home unnecessarily after a contact with someone who tests positive for Covid, “finding it hard to move on from the ‘bubble-isolation mentality’”. The report, Securing Good Attendance and Tackling Persistent Absence, follows a call last year by the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, for a close examination into low attendance rates in schools in England. “It appears that the provision of remote education during national lockdowns has negatively affected some pupils’ perceptions of the need to be in school, particularly in secondary schools,” the report states. “There is a sense from some pupils, as one leader explained, that ‘you weren’t fussed when we weren’t in school all that time in lockdown and we did our work at home, so why does it matter so much now?’” it went on. Many schools have continued to make lessons available online because of continuing high Covid rates with many pupils still off sick and isolating. Some pupils have told teachers, however, they would prefer to work at home and can’t understand why they can’t work remotely rather than coming into school. The report says: “Where one pupil has Covid-19 and is receiving remote education, this can affect other pupils’ perceptions: ‘My mate’s home, learning online, so the provision must be there, so why can’t I have it too?’, as one leader put it.” Ofsted said some absences were linked to families who feel they have not had a holiday in a long time, with some taking a previously cancelled holiday during term time, though some schools reported fewer term time holidays. Among other influences, one school leader said some families were affected by reports of rising Covid rates in their local area and kept their children off school as a result. Ofsted’s chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, said: “There’s no doubt that schools continue to face some very tricky challenges around pupil attendance. But it is clear that leaders who have previously improved pupil attendance have managed to maintain good levels this term by applying the same principle of ‘listen, understand, empathise and support – but do not tolerate [absences]’.”",News/Education,"Pupils in England reluctant to return to school after lockdown, says report",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/07/pupils-in-england-reluctant-to-return-to-school-after-lockdown-says-report
2/8/2022,"My mother, Frances Seeley, who has died aged 85 after a stroke, was a primary school teacher who was involved in training staff across Coventry in the Standard Attainment Tests (SATs). The daughter of Florence (nee Weaver) and Oliver Smith, Frances was born in Uckfield, East Sussex, where her parents were in service. During the second world war, her father was away from home with the army for five years and was awarded the Military Medal. The family moved to Coventry, where Frances spent the night of the blitz under a staircase at home, as her baby brother, Robert, had chicken pox and and the family could not get to their shelter.  Her father was demobbed in 1946, but her mother died within a year of his return. Frances passed the 11-plus exam and attended Stoke Park grammar school for girls. The family finances were strained, and, though intellectually able, Frances had to start work. She got a job in the dye house at the textile manufacturer Courtaulds in the city, where her facility to pipette liquids to an amazing degree of accuracy was much admired. In 1958 she married Peter Seeley, who worked at the Morris car factory. As well as bringing up their two children, Frances was endlessly patient and thoughtful in the care of her mother-in-law, who lived with us from 1967 until her death in 1985. In 1968 Frances fulfilled her ambition of training as a teacher, at the Canley College of Education (later merged with the University of Warwick). She chose art and craft as a specialism and was especially keen on pottery and weaving. Her first permanent teaching post was in 1971 at Hollyfast primary school in Coventry, followed in 1977 by Hearsall primary – a school with a much more diverse catchment, where she enjoyed working with children of many cultures, faiths and ethnicities. For many years Frances led the school’s annual camp for children – many of whom had never been away from home. With the introduction of the new Standard Attainment Tests (SATs) from 1989, Frances took the opportunity to put herself forward for this work. She thought that if teachers were going to have to implement the new system, it was better that they heard about it and were trained in it by someone who had real experience in those roles. On retirement in 1994 Frances took up the role of churchwarden for All Saints, Allesley, where she had worshipped for more than 40 years. She was instrumental in bringing about the creation of a woodland burial site alongside the church. She was involved in charitable activities, as a member of St John Ambulance, raising funds for Leukaemia Research and running charity events for the church. Peter died in 2018. After her stroke in 2019, Frances moved to live first with her son – my brother, Chris - and then with me in Nottingham. Frances is survived by Chris and me, and four grandchildren.",News/From the Guardian,Frances Seeley obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2022/feb/07/frances-seeley-obituary
2/8/2022,"The former owner of Norton Motorcycles faces up to two years in prison after pleading guilty to illegally investing millions of pounds of people’s retirement savings into his own businesses. Stuart Garner, who acquired the classic marque in 2008 and was feted by a series of UK government ministers including the MP Stephen Barclay, the prime minister’s new chief of staff since Saturday, admitted three offences at Derby magistrates court on Monday.  Garner will be sentenced at the end of the month, when he faces a maximum of two years in prison or an unlimited fine. The admission comes after pension holders had been complaining for years that the businessman had repeatedly ignored their requests to return their retirement savings. It also follows a 2020 Guardian and ITV News investigation that showed how more than 200 “ordinary working people” had had their entire pension pots invested into Norton shares. The motorcycle company slumped into administration in January 2020, leaving the pension fund holders owed about £14m. In June 2020, Garner was ordered to pay the money back after the Pensions Ombudsman ruled he acted “dishonestly”. It is understood the pension holders are still waiting for any of their funds to be returned. On Monday, the court heard that the offences related to three Norton pension schemes, Dominator 2012, Commando 2012 and Donington MC, which had a combined total of 227 members. The investments into Norton breached technical pensions laws preventing more than 5% of an occupational scheme’s value from being invested into assets connected to the employer’s company. Nicola Parish, executive director of frontline regulation at the Pensions Regulator, said: “As a trustee, Stuart Garner failed to comply with restrictions on investments which are designed to protect the funds of pension schemes. Trustees have a vital role in protecting the benefits of members and we will take action where that responsibility is abused.” While the Norton schemes were occupational pension funds, which are usually set up for the benefit of a company’s employees, most of the pension savings were originally invested into Norton during 2012 and 2013 by people with no connection to the motorcycle firm. They were later shown to be victims of a so-called “pensions liberation” fraud, a type of scam when savers are tricked into switching their retirement funds out of established schemes. The case resulted in its promoter, Simon Colfer, being convicted of fraud in 2018 for the way in which he had sold the schemes. Garner has always said he had no knowledge of Colfer’s fraud. Two further Garner associates involved in setting up the Norton pensions schemes – Andrew Meeson and Peter Bradley – were also convicted of a separate tax fraud in 2013, when they reclaimed £5m of tax rebates from fictitious pension contributions. Court documents from that trial state that £990,000 of the proceeds of the tax fraud were loaned to Garner, which he used to originally acquire the Norton brand in 2008. Garner was not implicated in any wrongdoing in the tax fraud case. He did not respond to invitations to comment on Monday.",News/UK news,Ex-owner of Norton Motorcycles faces jail over breaches of pensions rules,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/07/ex-owner-of-norton-motorcycles-faces-jail-over-breaches-of-pensions-rules
