5/13/2022,"An image featuring women‚Äôs bare breasts has been banned in the United Kingdom following several complaints alleging the images cause ‚Äúwidespread offense‚Äù and are inappropriate for children. In February, Adidas launched a campaign on social media as well as billboards and posters, featuring women‚Äôs breasts of all shapes and skin tones ‚Äî with the nipples blurred out. The campaign, shared in the United States as well, was meant to promote and celebrate the company‚Äôs 43 styles of sports bras. ‚ÄúBreasts of all shapes and sizes deserve support and comfort tailored to them,‚Äù Adidas shared in a statement, alongside a collage featuring 24 images of women‚Äôs breasts. ‚ÄúWhich is why our new sports bra range contains 43 styles, so everyone can find the right sports bra for them. In sport, everybody should feel free and inspired by what their bodies can achieve.‚Äù However, the pictures weren‚Äôt sitting well with a lot of viewers. According to the BBC, the Advertising Standards Agency, the UK‚Äôs independent regulator of advertising across all media, received 24 complaints claiming the ads's use of nudity objectified women by sexualizing them and ‚Äúreducing them to body parts.‚Äù There were also concerns about whether or not the images were appropriate to be displayed where children could see them. Twitter had also reportedly received a number of complaints but was quick to clarify that the images were not in breach of its terms of service. ‚ÄúAlthough we did not consider that the way the women were portrayed was sexually explicit or objectified them,‚Äù the ASA said this week, ""we considered that the depiction of naked breasts was likely to be seen as explicit nudity. We noted the breasts were the main focus in the ads, and there was less emphasis on the bras themselves, which were only referred to in the accompanying text."" The statement continued: ""The ads must not appear again in the forms complained of. We told Adidas UK Ltd to ensure their ads did not cause offense and were targeted responsibly."" We believe women‚Äôs breasts in all shapes and sizes deserve support and comfort. Which is why our new sports bra range contains 43 styles, so everyone can find the right fit for them.üîó Explore the new adidas sports bra collection at https://t.co/fJZUEjvopQ#SupportIsEverything pic.twitter.com/CESqmsXOwI ‚Äî adidas (@adidas) February 9, 2022 Despite the number of complaints received by the ASA, there was still widespread support from Adidas customers, many of whom applauded the company's stance on body positivity. ""Thanks for keeping us abreast of body positivity, Adidas!"" one user wrote in the comments section of the company's Twitter ad. ""This is the breast ever!"" Playboy magazine wrote from its official account. ""Despite all the negative comments I love this,"" one reader added. ""My boobies have changed so much over the years and it‚Äôs lovely to see a brand catering for changes and seeing all boobies are normal and natural and beautiful.""

5/13/2022,"Disney travel agent Bren Ladd visited Magic Kingdom with her husband on April 23. While leaving the theme park, she filmed an employee attempting to remove a snake from the entrance. She spoke with Insider about the incident, and how calm she said everyone was during it. If you're looking to experience wildlife at Disney World, Animal Kingdom is the place to go. But occasionally, you'll also find unexpected creatures at Magic Kingdom, too. Bren Ladd, a 42-year-old travel agent, was visiting the Orlando, Florida, theme park with her husband on April 23 for a ""kid-free weekend,"" as she told Insider. They were leaving Magic Kingdom when she noticed ""a small circle starting to form"" near the park's entrance. ""I noticed this amazing cast member trying to move a snake away from the turnstiles,"" she said. ""She didn't seem fazed by it ‚Äî she's probably done it before."" A video of the incident, which Ladd filmed and later shared to TikTok on April 29, has been viewed nearly 2 million times as of Thursday. ""It wasn't a big deal and people weren't freaking out,"" Ladd added. ""I just wanted to capture how the whole interaction went down."" She went on to say that the Disney employee quickly brought the snake to a patch of bushes, leading the crowd to disperse. Still, it's not lost on Ladd that this viral video of hers might scare some people away from the theme park. ""I find it ironic,"" she said. ""I started my TikTok page to get my name out there as a Disney travel planner. But the video of mine that went viral will probably deter people from booking their trip or going to Florida in general."" Of course, snakes and other animals including alligators are common in Florida. In fact, around the same time last year, another Disney parkgoer filmed the moment when a group of gorillas at Animal Kingdom discovered a snake wiggling through their enclosure.

5/13/2022,"A Ukrainian soldier in a liberated town said that killing Russian forces is ""like a sport now."" Volodymyr Demchenko described what it was like killing Russian forces during an interview with CNN. It's a ""very weird feeling to be honest, but it's like a sport now,"" Demchenko said. A Ukrainian soldier in a small town that was liberated after a weeks-long Russian occupation amid the Kremlin's war with Ukraine said that killing Russian forces is ""like a sport now."" Soldier Volodymyr Demchenko described killing Russian forces during a recent interview with CNN in Novyi Bykiv, a town located in the Chernihiv region and is about 50 miles east of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. CNN reported that Demchenko was on the drone team that successfully helped to take back Novyi Bykiv from Russian forces. ""You know, it's funny to see‚Ä¶it's not funny to see, it's actually very strange when you see people being killed and you're like, 'Yeah!"" Demchenko told CNN as he raised his arms in the air. He added that it's a ""very weird feeling to be honest, but it's like a sport now, I don't know."" ""They don't come to us with flowers,"" Demchenko told CNN in reference to Russian troops. Though Novyi Bykiv has been liberated, the town is still reeling from the destruction and losses it endured amid its occupation by Russian forces. Demchenko told CNN that his home was hit by Russian strikes, but his life was spared because he was outside at the time of the attack. The soldier pointed out where Russian troops were killed as he showed CNN's Erin Burnett around the village. ""There was a boot here and there was another with leg,"" said Demchenko. ""There was not dead bodies, it was just the pieces of dead bodies."" Russian President Vladimir Putin launched Moscow's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine on February 24 and the war has since left thousands dead on both sides, including many Ukrainian civilians. In recent weeks, Russia has focused its attacks in Ukraine on the eastern Donbas region after Russian troops failed to take Kyiv and other major cities.
