4/15/2022,"If Lake Powell isn’t already doomed, it may soon be. Insufficient runoff has put the reservoir on a quick and dangerous descent to 3,490 feet of elevation – a water level so low that Glen Canyon Dam’s hydropower turbines can no longer operate. A key part of the Western power grid would be lost. The city of Page and the LeChee Chapter of the Navajo Nation also would lose their drinking water because the infrastructure that supplies them could no longer function. Not to mention that if Powell falls to 3,490 feet, the only way millions of acre-feet of Colorado River water can flow past the dam and downstream to sustain Lake Mead – the reservoir on which Arizona relies – is through four bypass tubes, which have never handled that kind of volume, particularly for an extended period. Engineers are concerned whether this setup can move enough water, especially if one or more of the tubes were damaged by heavy flows over time. If the bypass tubes move significantly less water than what the eight turbines do now, that could all but guarantee the demise of Lake Mead. This is serious. The U.S. Department of the Interior, which operates the two reservoirs via the Bureau of Reclamation, said in a grimly worded letter last week that it must take more drastic actions to slow Powell’s descent. “We are approaching operating conditions for which we have only very limited actual operating experience – and which occurred nearly 60 years ago,” the letter states. “We hope to be able to delay or avoid operational conditions below (3,490 feet) but we fully realize that absent a change in the recent hydrological conditions, we may not be able to avoid such operations.” Did you catch that? Interior is essentially saying that if we don’t get more snow (and that snow doesn’t produce more runoff), the best we may be able to do is delay the point at which Powell falls below 3,490 feet. In other words, we are once again being asked to sacrifice – not to fix the problem, but simply to buy time. If this feels like déjà vu, well, it is. We haven’t even fully implemented the 500-plus plan from December, in which the lower basin states of Arizona, California and Nevada agreed to store an additional 500,000 acre-feet of water in Lake Mead each year, simply to lower the risk of it tanking before 2026. That deal, which is only funded for the next two years but must persist through 2026 if we want to protect Lake Mead, essentially pays people not to use water. It’s not a solution. We’re simply buying time. And that’s on top of the mandatory cuts in the Drought Contingency Plan, which the lower basin states signed in 2019 – again, not to fix Mead’s problems, but to simply buy us time. Reclamation has already delayed the release of 350,000 acre-feet from Powell to Mead though the end of this month – a move that makes Powell appear about 7 feet higher than it otherwise would be. Its current elevation is 3,522 feet. It also is finalizing a Drought Response Operations Plan to protect Powell elevations – something the upper basin agreed to do in its version of the Drought Contingency Plan – potentially by moving more water from the smaller reservoirs upstream into Powell. Now, Interior is asking the basin states to accept a release of just 7 million acre-feet from Powell to Mead this water year, which ends in September, instead of the 7.48 million acre-feet we were expecting. That’s the smallest release since the river’s operational guidelines were created in 2007 – and the first time its operational tiers would be adjusted down to provide less water mid-year. Interior also says it wants to provide “additional certainty regarding annual release volumes and tier determinations for the 2023 water year.” How would that work? And how long would an extra 480,000 acre-feet last in Powell – without causing significant pain for Mead? The details have not been publicly discussed, but Interior has given states until April 22 to weigh in. This is a tenuous moment. Annual releases from Powell to Mead have always been a point of contention among the upper and lower basins. This could easily devolve into finger pointing over how we got into this shape or who should have done more to prevent it. Indeed, it’s an open question whether the states will submit a joint response agreeing to what Interior has proposed, or whether some might branch off if they don’t like the deal. As tempting as it is to get indignant or self-righteous about how much we’re already doing, it is in Arizona’s best interest to do more – even if it hurts, and yes, even if it doesn’t resolve anything. It would buy time to install new pipes for Page and the adjacent LeChee community and delay the risky venture of moving water through Powell’s bypass tubes. The consequences are probably far worse for Mead if we send water through those backup pipes and one of them fails than if we were to leave what might amount to about 8 feet of additional water in Powell. No, that does not make it a good idea. We are buying time in increasingly shorter durations, with heavier costs and fewer decent alternatives. This can’t continue for much longer. The guidelines for operating the river expire at the end of 2026. Yet state negotiators (and Reclamation) have spent most of their time and energy putting out these fires, not making headway on the issues that must drive a new set of rules, like how much water the Colorado River can realistically provide to states moving forward. If 7.5 million acre-feet – the annual amount guaranteed to each basin in the Colorado River compact – is no longer realistic, what is? If we don’t answer questions like this soon, there won’t be a Lake Powell (or a Lake Mead) to save. Reach Allhands at joanna.allhands@arizonarepublic.com. On Twitter: @joannaallhands.

4/15/2022,"(Please note language some may find offensive in paragraph 8) * Ukraine says ship damaged in missile strike * All crew evacuated - Interfax * Moskva missile cruiser usually has crew of 500 (Adds background, details) By David Ljunggren April 14 (Reuters) - The flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, the Moskva missile cruiser, was badly damaged when ammunition on board blew up, Interfax news agency quoted the defence ministry as saying on Thursday. The blast is yet another military setback for Russia, which has suffered a series of blows since invading Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what Moscow calls a ""special military operation"" to ""denazify"" the country. Interfax said all the crew had been evacuated. It cited the ministry as blaming the blast on a fire and said the cause was being investigated. A Ukrainian official earlier said the Moskva had been hit by two anti-ship missiles but did not give any evidence. The 12,500 tonne ship usually has a crew of around 500. ""As the result of a fire on the Moskva missile cruiser, ammunition detonated. The ship was seriously damaged,"" the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement. ""The crew was completely evacuated."" Russian news agencies said the Moskva, commissioned in 1983, was armed with 16 anti-ship ""Vulkan"" cruise missiles with a range of at least 700 km (440 miles). Interfax did not give more details of the incident. In April 2021, the agency quoted a retired Russian admiral as saying ""this is the most serious ship in the Black Sea"". Kyiv says the Moskva featured in one of the landmark early exchanges of the war, when Ukrainian border guards on Snake Island, a small outcrop in the Black Sea, told the ship to ""go fuck yourself"" after it demanded they surrender. Although Ukrainian officials initially said all 13 guards had died in the subsequent Russian attack, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy later said some of them survived. Maksym Marchenko, governor of the region around the Black Sea port of Odesa, earlier said the Moskva had been hit by two Ukrainian-made Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles, but did not provide evidence. ""It has been confirmed that the missile cruiser Moskva today went exactly where the border guards on Snake Island told it to go,"" he said in an online post. Ukraine's defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Last month Ukraine said it had destroyed a large Russian landing support ship, the Orsk, on the smaller Sea of Azov to the northeast of the Black Sea. Moscow has not commented on what had happened to the ship.

4/15/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Western weaponry pouring into Ukraine helped blunt Russia's initial offensive and seems certain to play a central role in the approaching, potentially decisive, battle for Ukraine's contested Donbas region. Yet the Russian military is making little headway halting what has become a historic arms express. The U.S. numbers alone are mounting: more than 12,000 weapons designed to defeat armored vehicles, some 1,400 shoulder-fired Stinger missiles to shoot down aircraft and more than 50 million rounds of ammunition, among many other things. Dozens of other nations are adding to the totals. President Joe Biden on Wednesday approved another $800 million worth of military assistance, including additional helicopters and the first provision of American artillery. These armaments have helped an under-gunned Ukrainian military defy predictions that it would be quickly overrun by Russia. They explain in part why Russian President Vladimir Putin’s army gave up, at least for now, its attempt to capture Kyiv, the capital, and has narrowed its focus to battling for eastern and southern Ukraine. U.S. officials and analysts offer numerous explanations for why the Russians have had so little success interdicting Western arms moving overland from neighboring countries, including Poland. Among the likely reasons: Russia's failure to win full control of Ukraine's skies has limited its use of air power. Also, the Russians have struggled to deliver weapons and supplies to their own troops in Ukraine. Some say Moscow's problem begins at home. “The short answer to the question is that they are an epically incompetent army badly led from the very top,” said James Stavridis, a retired U.S. Navy admiral who was the top NATO commander in Europe from 2009 to 2013. The Russians also face practical obstacles. Robert G. Bell, a longtime NATO official and now a professor at the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs at Georgia Tech University, said the shipments lend themselves to being hidden or disguised in ways that can make them elusive to the Russians — “short of having a network of espionage on the scene” to pinpoint the convoys' movements. “It’s not as easy to stop this assistance flow as it might seem,” said Stephen Biddle, a professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University. “Things like ammunition and shoulder-fired missiles can be transported in trucks that look just like any other commercial truck. And the trucks carrying the munitions the Russians want to interdict are just a small part of a much larger flow of goods and commerce moving around in Poland and Ukraine and across the border. “So the Russians have to find the needle in this very big haystack to destroy the weapons and ammo they’re after and not waste scarce munitions on trucks full of printer paper or baby diapers or who knows what.” Even with this Western assistance it's uncertain whether Ukraine will ultimately prevail against a bigger Russian force. The Biden administration has drawn the line at committing U.S. troops to the fight. It has opted instead to orchestrate international condemnation and economic sanctions, provide intelligence information, bolster NATO's eastern flank to deter a wider war with Russia and donate weapons. In mid-March, a Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said arms shipments would be targeted. “We warned the United States that pumping weapons into Ukraine from a number of countries as it has orchestrated isn’t just a dangerous move but an action that turns the respective convoys into legitimate targets,” he said in televised remarks. But thus far the Russians appear not to have put a high priority on arms interdiction, perhaps because their air force is leery of flying into Ukraine's air defenses to search out and attack supply convoys on the move. They have struck fixed sites like arms depots and fuel storage locations, but to limited effect. On Monday, the Russians said they destroyed four S-300 surface-to-air missile launchers that had been given to Ukraine by an unspecified European country. Slovakia, a NATO member that shares a border with Ukraine, donated just such a system last week but denied it had been destroyed. On Tuesday, the Russian Ministry of Defense said long-range missiles were used to hit two Ukrainian ammo depots. As the fighting intensifies in the Donbas and perhaps along the coastal corridor to the Russian-annexed Crimean Peninsula, Putin may feel compelled to strike harder at the arms pipeline, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called vital to his nation's survival. In the meantime, a staggering volume and range of war materiel is arriving almost daily. “The scope and speed of our support to meeting Ukraine’s defense needs are unprecedented in modern times,"" said John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary. He said the approximately $2.6 billion in weapons and other material that has been offered to Ukraine since the beginning of the Biden administration is equivalent to more than half of Ukraine's normal defense budget. One example: The Pentagon says it has provided more than 5,000 Javelin missiles, which are among the world's most effective weapons against tanks and other armored vehicles — and can even take down a low-flying helicopter. The missile, shaped like a clunky dumb bell and weighing 50 pounds (23 kilograms), is fired by an individual soldier; from its launch tube it flies up at a steep angle and descends directly onto its target in what its known as a curveball shot — hitting the top of a tank where its armor is weakest. The Pentagon said Wednesday that an unspecified number of additional Javelins are to be delivered by Thursday, and the U.S. will complete the delivery of 100 armed Switchblade “kamikaze” drones this week. The specific routes used to move the U.S. and other Western materials into Ukraine are secret for security reasons, but the basic process is not. Just this week, two U.S. military cargo planes arrived in Eastern Europe with items ranging from machine guns and small arms ammunition to body armor and grenades, the Pentagon said. A similar load is due later this week to complete delivery of $800 million in assistance approved by Biden just one month ago. The weapons and equipment are offloaded, moved onto trucks and driven into Ukraine by Ukrainian soldiers for delivery. Kirby said the material sometimes reaches troops in the field within 48 hours of entering Ukraine.",World/Associated Press,Russia has yet to slow a Western arms express into Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-yet-slow-western-arms-041203366.html
4/15/2022,"Researchers have revealed a new thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cell that converts heat to electricity with over 40 percent efficiency, performance nearly on par with traditional steam turbine power plants. The cells have the potential to be used in grid-scale ""thermal batteries,"" generating energy dependably with no moving parts. Thermophotovoltaic cells work by heating semiconducting materials enough to significantly boost the energy of photons. At high enough energies, those photos can kick an electron across the material's ""bandgap,"" generating electricity. So far, TPV cells have achieved up to just 32 percent efficiency because they operate at lower temperatures. By contrast, the new design from MIT and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) takes power from white-hot heat sources between 1,900 to 2,400 degree Celsius (3,452 to 4,352 degrees F). To do that, it uses ""high-bandgap"" metal alloys sitting over a slightly lower-bandgap alloy. The high-bandgap layer captures the highest-energy photons from a heat source and converts them to electricity, while lower-energy photons pass through the first layer and add to the voltage. Any photons that run the two-layer gauntlet are reflected by a mirror back to the heat source to avoid wasting energy. This is an absolutely critical step on the path to proliferate renewable energy and get to a fully decarbonized grid. Measuring the efficiency using a heat flux sensor, the team found that power varied with temperature. Between 1,900 to 2,400 degrees Celsius, the new TPV design produced electricity with about 40 percent efficiency. Steam turbines can deliver the same efficiency, but are far more complicated and restricted to lower temperatures. ""One of the advantages of solid-state energy converters are that they can operate at higher temperatures with lower maintenance costs because they have no moving parts,"" MIT Professor Asegun Henry told MIT News. ""They just sit there and reliably generate electricity."" In a grid-scale thermal battery, the system would absorb excess energy from renewable sources like the sun and store it in heavily insulated banks of hot graphite. When needed, the TPV cells could then convert that heat to electricity and send it to the power grid. The experimental cell was just a square centimeter, so the team would have to ramp that up to around 10,000 square feet for grid-level power, but the technology already exists to create cells on that scale, Henry notes. ""Thermophotovoltaic cells were the last key step toward demonstrating that thermal batteries are a viable concept,"" he said. ""This is an absolutely critical step on the path to proliferate renewable energy and get to a fully decarbonized grid.""",Science/Engadget,Thermophotovoltaic cell converts 40 percent of heat energy to electricity,https://news.yahoo.com/thermophotovoltaic-cell-converts-40-percent-of-heat-energy-to-electricity-101051572.html
