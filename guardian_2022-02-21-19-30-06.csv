2/21/2022,"Edward ShawcrossFaber, £20, pp324  In the 1860s, the French emperor Napoleon III came up with a ploy that, as the historian Edward Shawcross suggests, “was outrageous even by the standards of European imperialism”. He would invade Mexico by proxy, install a puppet emperor on the throne and thereby expand France’s dominion. Unfortunately, the titular ruler, “the hapless Habsburg archduke” Maximilian I, proved singularly ill-equipped for the task, preferring poetry and drama to the gritty business of imperialism. Shawcross’s fascinating debut is keenly attuned to the ironies and tragedies that Maximilian faced in his ill-fated task. Vesna GoldsworthyChatto & Windus, £14.99, pp320 Vesna Goldsworthy’s excellent new novel is a comedy of manners that is nevertheless fraught with tension. Its protagonist, Milena, is one of the fortunate beneficiaries of Soviet largesse in the 80s and observes the privations that others endure with suitable detachment. But when she falls in love with an English poet and flees from behind the iron curtain to Britain, she discovers that she has exchanged her gilded cage for a life of terminal incompatibility. Goldsworthy captures the human perspective of life in the cold war superbly and sympathetically. Michael CoveneyMethuen Drama, £14.99, pp199 Whether you believe that amateur dramatics are “an exhibitionist’s alternative to bridge”, in the dismissive words of Kenneth Tynan, or an invaluable way of supporting communities and keeping alive neglected plays, former Observer drama critic Michael Coveney’s fascinating account of the history of am-dram is compulsively readable and extremely funny. Focusing on such leading amateur theatres as Cornwall’s Minack and Bolton’s Little theatre, which launched Ian McKellen’s career, and their practitioners, Coveney pays equal attention to the stars who emerged from such institutions and those who remained proudly non-professional.

2/21/2022,"Harold Pinter was a perfectionist when it came to the theatre, even down to how an ice-cream seller should exit the auditorium, according to a previously unpublished letter. In 1985, the dramatist directed the West End debut of Tennessee Williams’s Sweet Bird of Youth, starring Lauren Bacall, which opened on 8 July at the Theatre Royal Haymarket. On 24 July, he wrote to Anthony Peek, the theatre’s then manager, praising the previous night’s performance: “It was in pretty good shape, I thought, and I am delighted that business is so splendid.”  But he went on to air two complaints: “The usher with ice-cream in the dress circle remained standing until the house lights went down. He then marched up the steps and closed the doors, thereby causing reflection of light on to the stage. Can he leave the post earlier, do you think?” He also grumbled that the curtain had gone up 12 minutes late, “a great pity, as 98% of the audience is seated by 7.30”. Pinter, who died in 2008, was one of the greatest modern dramatists, as well as an actor and director. Awarded the Nobel prize for literature in 2005, his masterpieces include The Caretaker, The Homecoming and The Servant. The letter has been discovered by Thomas Edsall of leading antiquarian bookseller, the 19th Century Rare Book & Photograph Shop, in Brooklyn, New York. It had been buried in a box of Peek’s miscellaneous letters and Christmas cards, which the bookseller had acquired. Stapled to Pinter’s typed, signed letter is a carbon copy of Peek’s polite reply, accepting the criticisms. Edsall told the Guardian: “The letter shows Pinter’s … attention to the most minute details relating to the staging of the play. The manager, Anthony Peek, a veteran of the West End, is undaunted by this giant of British theatre. He stands up for the theatre’s policy on the late start, but he admits that the matter of the ice-cream is indefensible, saying: ‘You are absolutely right about the usher’.” Michael Billington, Pinter’s biographer and former Guardian critic, said: “Harold was famous for being a perfectionist, particularly when it came to anything to do with rehearsal or performance. He was acutely aware and very conscious of noise and interruptions. He quite rightly wanted from an audience and everyone involved in a play absolute, 100% concentration. This is very much in keeping with his character.” The discovery comes as a leading American director, Carey Perloff, is publishing a book about her close collaborations with both Pinter and Tom Stoppard on numerous US productions of their plays over several decades. In Pinter and Stoppard: A Director’s View, published this week by Methuen Drama, Bloomsbury Publishing, she recalls that Pinter was so precise about his approach that he would point out if an actor had not paused sufficiently. She also remembers that, when her new-born baby was in a carry-cot in a theatre’s dressing-room, he did not acknowledge the child until he needed a way to convey the relationship between a father and daughter. She told the Guardian: “We were rehearsing Mountain Language, a play about a political prisoner who’s never seen his child. Peter Riegert, a wonderful actor, was playing the prisoner and he was having a hard time with the scene. He couldn’t personalise it. Finally Pinter … walked to the dressing-room, picked up the baby … and brought her into the room. “He said very calmly: ‘Peter, now this is your child and you have been prevented from ever seeing her because of your politics … It’s completely specific. Now play the scene.’ Peter stared at this baby, started to cry and then he did the scene. Pinter picked the baby up and put her back in the dressing-room … The scene was always amazing after that.”",Arts/Culture,"Harold Pinter’s perfectionism included ice-cream sales, letter shows",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/21/harold-pinters-perfectionism-included-ice-cream-sales-letter-shows
2/21/2022,"Ukraine has called for the EU to impose sanctions against Russia immediately, and has won the support of at least one member state, amid scepticism that a proposed summit between Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden can avert a Russian military invasion. At a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, had the backing of the Lithuanian government as he argued the bloc should hit the Kremlin with sanctions now.  Kuleba said Kyiv backed France’s idea of a summit between the US and Russian presidents but that Moscow needed to see tangible evidence of the west’s resolve to defend his country, which is surrounded by more than 150,000 Russian troops. “There are plenty of decisions that the European Union can take now can make now to send clear messages to Russia, that its escalation will not be tolerated and Ukraine will not be left on its own,” Kuleba said. “This includes not only political messaging political signals, but also some very specific acts like supporting the development of our defence sector, supporting Ukraine’s cybersecurity imposing some of the sanctions. “We believe that there are good reasons, good and legitimate reasons, to impose at least some of the sanctions now to demonstrate that the European Union is not only talking the talk about sanctions but also is walking the walk.” Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign affairs chief, said the EU would support Ukraine “at the most critical moment, if this happens”, in a sign of the general support among member states for holding back on sanctions for now. “At the right moment I will call an extraordinary meeting,” Borrell said. “But I hope the moment will not come.” The EU has threatened “severe costs and massive consequences” in the event of a further Russian incursion into Ukraine. The package has yet to be made public but it would involve a block on exports of key electrical components on which Russia is reliant, potentially an import ban on Russian oil and gas, and the freezing of assets of individuals and companies affiliated to the government in Moscow. Lithuania’s foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, said he believed the moment for action was now, given the cyber-attacks and the damaging economic pressure being applied on Kyiv by Moscow. He said: “We believe the attack has already started … We have to start debating about an answer already to the current situation. Everything we are talking about [is] just waiting for military attack but Russia has a huge arsenal of things it can deploy before a military attack. “We do not need to wait for a military attack. I can tell you Ukraine is already under attack. First of all, economically. Its economy is already facing huge challenges that are not of Ukraine’s making, they were forced on Ukraine. “To add to that: the terror campaign. You have to imagine the country is surrounded by a foreign army that is threatening invasion that is already putting a lot of pressure on Ukraine.” On Sunday, a spokesperson for the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who spoke to Putin twice earlier in the day, said the Russian leader and Biden were willing “in principle” to meet. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Monday that a meeting could happen but that there were no concrete plans. He said Putin would address a special session of Russia’s security council imminently. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, arriving in Brussels, told reporters: “I appeal urgently to the Russian government, to the Russian president: Don’t play with human lives.”",News/World news,Ukraine calls for urgent EU sanctions on Russia to avert invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/ukraine-calls-for-urgent-eu-sanctions-on-russia-to-avert-invasion
2/21/2022,"Ministers will reject making misogyny a hate crime in England and Wales and urge MPs to get behind controversial legislation that has been criticised for curbing the right to protest as the government seeks to push through major changes to the criminal justice system. In a move which will set up a clash with Conservative backbenchers and opposition MPs when the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill returns to parliament next week, the home secretary, Priti Patel, will write to members on Monday saying the government will oppose a Lords amendment that would extend hate crimes to cover misogyny.  The Home Office said its rejection is based on a Law Commission report, which warned that extending hate crimes to cover misogyny would prove “more harmful than helpful” to victims of violence against women and girls. The government says it is also “carefully considering” a new offence of street harassment that would criminalise the verbal abuse of women, pestering and persistent cat-calling or making lewd comments. A new Scottish standalone offence of misogyny is under discussion by an expert working group and is expected to report to ministers in Edinburgh this month. The letter comes after the government has been forced into a series of concessions on crime and violence against women and girls over the last few months. Responding to the letter, Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, condemned Patel for failing to introduce new legislation to tackle hatred against women. “It is shameful that the home secretary is still refusing to make violence against women and girls a strategic policing requirement so it has the same prominence as tackling organised crime. “She is also still refusing to establish specialist rape units in every police force area or minimum sentence for rape and stalking, and shockingly is still resisting Labour’s proposals for action against landlords who pressurise tenants into sex for rent,” she said. The House of Lords inflicted a string of defeats on the bill last month, which saw the upper chamber reject controversial measures designed to combat the tactics adopted by groups including Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain and on a separate clause that would have imposed noise restrictions on demonstrations. Peers also voted against new powers that would give police powers to stop and search those who they suspect of taking part in illegal protests. The upper chamber can delay, though not entirely block, legislation, but its actions can often embarrass and stall government plans. The bill returns to the Commons next week for a round of parliamentary ping-pong, where legislation passes between the two houses until an agreement is reached. The Home Office said the revised version of the draft law going before the Commons will tighten a number of measures, including extending the time limit for prosecution of common assault or battery in domestic abuse cases. Officials said the “enhanced” version of the draft legislation would also include introducing “Harper’s law”, which will extend mandatory life sentences to those convicted of the unlawful manslaughter of an on-duty emergency worker. It follows a campaign by the widow of PC Andrew Harper, who was killed while responding to a quad bike theft by three teenagers in August 2019. Addressing peers’ amendment on adding misogyny as a hate crime, the Home Office cited how a Law Commission review had found that legislating to make misogyny a hate crime would prove “more harmful than helpful” to victims of violence against women and girls. Home Office officials said ministers would also “continue fighting” to bring in increase police powers for dealing with “highly disruptive protests”, a policy that has sparked “kill the bill” demonstrations across the country. Announcing her intention to write to MPs on Monday, Patel said: “There are still too many criminals getting off with inadequate sentences for appalling acts of violence and sexual offences and still people who feel unsafe walking the streets or in their own homes. “This bill is vitally important as we overhaul the criminal justice system and make our streets safer.”",News/Society,Ministers to reject making misogyny a hate crime in England and Wales,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/21/ministers-to-reject-making-misogyny-a-hate-in-england-and-wales-police-bill
2/21/2022,"I can’t undo all I have done to myself,what I have let an appetite for love do to me.  I have wanted all the world, its beautiesand its injuries; some days,I think that is punishment enough. Often, I received more than I’d asked, which is how this works – you fish in open waterready to be wounded on what you reel in. Throwing it back was a nightmare.Throwing it back and seeing my own face as it disappeared into the dark water. Catching my tongue suddenly on metal,spitting the hook into my open palm. Dear life: I feel that hook today most keenly. Would you loosen the line – you’ll listen if I ask you, if  you are the sort of  life I think you are. The Romanian-American poet Maya C Popa published her award-winning first collection, American Faith, in 2019. This week’s poem is from her most recent chapbook Dear Life, one of the four winners of The Poetry Business international book and pamphlet competition, 2021. The title poem is placed last in an elegant and cohesively organised short collection often reflecting the poet’s interest in English/British writing and landscape. Philip Larkin is a subtle presence at times. The week’s poem, with its emphasis on emotional risk-taking, hints at an additional influence from the American confessional poets of the 1960s. Its opening series of declarations centres on “an appetite for love” and the connection between self-abandonment (to erotic or otherwise love-charged experience) and poetic energy seems earthed in the lines “I have wanted all the world, its beauties / and its injuries …” The heroic manner can almost resemble that of Sylvia Plath but, as with Larkin, Popa coolly holds her own ground. The subjugation to all-or-nothing emotion is clearly seen as deliberate, something done by the protagonist to herself, and risk-assessed. It invites punishment (for the beauties, the injuries, and the sheer wanting) and while this may amount to rather more than the poet asked for, there’s a “less-deceived” understanding that it’s “how this works”. To demonstrate precisely “how this works”, Popa takes a fishing metaphor and revives it by splitting it into passive and active elements: “you fish in open water / ready to be wounded by what you reel in.” The past-tense narrative of stanza five might have quenched the rhetorical fire, but for the repetition of “throwing it back” and the sombrely stunning moment of passivity in “seeing my own face // as it disappears into the dark water.” Rejecting the devastation requires further self-wounding. The pain of un-hooking is analysed now, beginning with the sharply tactile description in the seventh stanza of the tongue on the metal, and the spitting of the hook “into my open palm.” The palm is sensibly “open” to this, as the imagination was once rashly open to all the riskiness of “open water”. Popa is skilled at what I think of as the one-line stanza – a single line, slowing the pace, insisting that a few words are allowed concentrated resonance and nuance. The address to “Dear life” is not the start of a letter, but a gasped prayer, impelled by a particular day when “I feel that hook most keenly”. The prayer is for relaxation and reduction. Life, by “loosening the line”, can let the poet off the self-inflicted hook. This demand for less rather than more emotion separates Dear Life from Romantic and confessional antecedents without reducing the emotional charge. Elsewhere in the collection, Popa takes an oblique look at Larkin’s oblique question, “Where can we live but days?” In the current poem, she admits to the anguish of a particular day, and asks courteously, desperately, for the mercy that ought to be possible. Life, it’s hoped, will provide blessedly un-notable days where we simply live.

2/21/2022,"Here is an argument you won’t often hear from a US gold medallist. Russia isn’t solely to blame for the crisis in the Olympic movement. The real problem is wider and more serious – and it represents a threat to the whole Olympic movement with Russia currently at the center. How might we view Russia? They could be seen like a kid behind you on an airplane who keeps kicking your seat. And yet when you turn around and ask them to stop, they keep going. If the parent doesn’t don’t hold the child accountable, what reason is there for behavior change? In this case the IOC executive board are the parents, and IOC president Thomas Bach is ultimately responsible.  But the Russians aren’t children and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is a master who has been able to manipulate and construct the system, and back Mr Bach, to his liking. After all, Putin was reported to be one of Bach’s first congratulatory phone calls when he was elected IOC president in 2013. But on Friday, Mr Bach rightly condemned the coach and entourage of 15-year-old Russian skater Kamila Valieva after she was coldly harangued by a coach who should have been comforting her. He was less bold when it came to criticizing the FSB-led effort at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, which involved passing urine through a hole in the wall, the Russian doper curler at the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics, and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) deleting massive troves of doped athlete data. Amid a litany of scandals, the IOC’s window-dressing attempts to restore integrity to the Olympic brand have amounted to little more than adding a word to the motto; it’s now Faster, Higher, Stronger – Together, in case you didn’t know. And you probably didn’t, because fewer and fewer people are paying attention. With record-low television ratings and cities no longer bidding to host the Games, the Olympics face an existential crisis. It is no longer good enough. And it is already hurting the Olympic movement. There are corporations who are wondering why they should put their billions of dollars behind a values-centered brand that betrays few real values anymore outside of the continuous parade of incredible athletes who rarely cease to disappoint. There are athletes who are increasingly unhappy because the IOC and other Olympic bodies’ leadership, other than athlete IOC members, will not sit down to address concerns of athletes outside of the system. These athletes and their allies have pushed for reforms that would have created more independence in global governing bodies or placed more recently retired or currently competing athletes at the decision-making tables – but no meaningful or material progress has been made. Let’s lay out the structure that is propping this up. The promoters of Olympic sport (the IOC), the police (the World Anti-Doping Agency, Wada), and the judiciary (the Court of Arbitration for Sport, CAS) of the Olympic movement are so entangled that it’s hard to tell where one stops and another begins. For example, a vice president of the IOC, John Coates, is the head of CAS – which rendered the ruling that allowed Valieva to compete, and previously took any teeth (there weren’t many to begin with) out of the original decision to punish Russia for their proven state-sponsored doping. Coates also happens to be the president of the Australian Olympic Committee, which recently were awarded the 2032 Games without competitive bidding. Small world. CAS literally re-wrote the doping code, according to Wada, when they allowed Valieva to compete last week. Another example of the IOC ensuring they are in control is that half of the Governing Board of Wada is mandated to be IOC Members. The IOC controls the appointment of the president and vice-president of the anti-doping authority. No matter how strong Wada can attempt to be, they will forever be tied to their governance system if things don’t change. In short, the entire Olympic movement has become a comedy of conflicted interests, few of which seem to involve the ultimate integrity of the Games and clearly none of which are ensuring a level playing field or justice. We do applaud the World Anti-Doping Agency and its staff for calling out the CAS decision involving Valieva, because it violated both WADA’s rules and precedent. But that’s how these things go in the Olympics – capriciously. And then there are press releases of condemnation, and nothing happens – except for declining interest and disillusion from viewers and cities. Rinse and repeat. Athlete representatives and sport leaders have attempted to find levers to pull to invite the IOC to reform. But the athletes have no leverage short of abandoning our dreams of becoming Olympians and sitting the next one out. And no one wants to do that, will do that, nor should do that. An Olympian “strike” isn’t feasible even though that’s what groups of underpaid, underserved and downtrodden groups at the bottom of massive pyramids with no voice have had to turn to for the past century. So what should happen next? For us, the levers on the IOC and Mr Bach sit in a handful of places: 1) The broadcasters – 73% of the IOC’s revenue comes from broadcast. Close to half of that comes from NBC, meaning the CEO of Comcast has the largest lever of them all. 2) The corporate sponsors - 18% of the IOC’s revenue comes from 13 of the most powerful brands in the world including Procter & Gamble, Visa and Coca-Cola. 3) The athletes – we have seen a strong athlete movement in the US bring meaningful reform to the American system. A concentrated, wide-spread athlete uprising or strike could do the trick. But this gets complicated in the short term for countries that solely rely on the IOC for financial support. 4) The United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee – which is the only Olympic Committee in the world that has a specific contract with the IOC for the disbursement of funds – has material powers at their disposal. This makes sense considering the amount of money coming from NBC for US market rights and that the sponsors need to ensure access to the American market through their IOC deal. If these power players decide to pull their levers, that may be the only opportunity for real, positive change and a strengthening of the system to defend itself against corrupt individuals and rogue states. If not, the Olympic movement might have to accept its fate as a drug-infested collection of competitions and competitors with no end in sight. Because the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. And considering many of the levers lie in many Americans’ hands, we would like to see, at the very least, the CEOs of the American broadcaster and IOC sponsors to meet with global athletes and experts. Soon. There are quality athlete reps out there, there are groups such as Global Athlete and the Athletics Association who represent wide swaths of international athletes who can bring independent, quality thinking to the table. With values-driven corporate CEOs involved, there can be values-driven deliverables created that we all need to see the IOC live up to to ensure the global Olympic brand gets out of this tailspin. We would want to see independence amongst the major governing bodies – the IOC, Wada, CAS have no interlocking members; no less than 33% athletes at every table of decision-making; clear rules and consequences that are more strict and more punitive for coaches, administrators and countries for wrongdoing than for athletes; term limits for both IOC Members as well as International sport administrators; and a zero-tolerance policy for individuals and states involved in systematic cheating, and violence and bribery in all of its forms. And then these CEOs and athletes would fly to Lausanne and sit down with Mr. Bach and in no-uncertain terms demand changes or a refund. For corporations sitting on the fence, remember, everyone loves a comeback story. After watching the athletes perform magnificently in Beijing, the core product continues to be inspirational and strong. But another thing is also clear: if the Olympic movement doesn’t live up its own stated ideals it will eventually pay a painful price.

2/21/2022,"Decades after the installation of a color barrier in professional baseball, one of the nation’s top Black athletes – Jackie Robinson – stood on a Major League field for a tryout. Infield practice, batting practice, fungoes – he did it all, including some memorable shots against the wall in left field. This did not take place at the Brooklyn Dodgers’ Ebbets Field, where Robinson would integrate the majors on 15 April 1947 though. Rather, it happened two years earlier, almost to the day, at Fenway Park. On 16 April 1945, the Boston Red Sox held a tryout for three Black players – Robinson, Sam Jethroe and Marvin Williams. No job offers resulted, and the Red Sox ended up becoming the last MLB team to integrate, over a decade later. That the tryout took place at all is a testament to two determined individuals – Isadore Muchnick, a white Boston city councilor, and Wendell Smith, a Black sportswriter. A new book honors such advocates in the long battle for integration on the diamond – Before Brooklyn: The Unsung Heroes Who Helped Break Baseball’s Color Barrier by Boston-based journalist Ted Reinstein.  “It struck me that while some people who were involved in that story have some degree of fame – some of them were famous like Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson – many people who were part of the story did not necessarily play baseball at all,” Reinstein says. He cites the Black press, which covered the Negro Leagues at a time when the white media largely ignored the story. And he mentions Black porters on Pullman train cars who risked their jobs to secretly bring aboard newspapers such as Smith’s Pittsburgh Courier, which found their way to Black households across the US, spreading the word about the Negro Leagues. “I began to realize that these people are not generally known at all in breaking the color barrier,” Reinstein says. In Boston, Muchnick used his knowledge of the city’s arcane Puritan-era bylaws to compel a tryout from the Red Sox – whose longtime owner, Tom Yawkey, was widely considered a racist. Team management insisted on no press coverage. When the Black players arrived in Boston, the Sox kept them waiting for nearly a week until Smith leaked news of the delay – as did white sportswriter Clif Keane. The tryout itself lasted 90 minutes. During it, Yawkey allegedly yelled a racial epithet at the players. Although Muchnick marveled at Robinson’s blasts off the Green Monster, the Sox never followed up with a job offer to him, Jethroe or Williams. Following Robinson’s debut, Jethroe did sign with another Boston MLB team at the time – the Braves. “Having grown up in Boston, I ask people in Boston if they could get past a shameful history like that,” Reinstein says of the Red Sox’ missed chance. “We’ve never fully gotten past that, never.” The author is a lifetime Robinson fan. His parents were active in the civil rights movement, took him to protests as a toddler and hosted a dinner for a Black folk singer named Jackie Washington – the first time Reinstein recalled having a Black guest in his home. Reinstein went on to become a reporter for a local TV newsmagazine show, Chronicle, and the author of several books. For his latest, he interviewed Paige’s daughters Pamela Paige O’Neal and Linda Paige Shelby, and Gibson’s great-grandson Sean Gibson, as well as experts at the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum and the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. As the book points out, baseball was not originally segregated. In 1884, Moses Fleetwood Walker became the first Black major league player. Just three years later, however, in 1887, National Association star Adrian “Cap” Anson, who was white, objected to his Chicago White Stockings team playing an exhibition game against Newark of the International League, because Newark had two Black players – Walker and pitching ace George Stovey. Both were kept out of the game. The International League voted to ban any further contracts with Black players, and professional baseball adopted this racist policy through a gentleman’s agreement. “A gentleman’s agreement, in a sense, is a coward’s agreement,” Reinstein says. “There’s a reason why a gentleman’s agreement is done without any record – a sense that it will not make them look good … It was the case in 1887, it’s the case today. There are still gentleman’s agreements all over.” He laments that the one in baseball prevented Blacks from playing the national pastime professionally on an equal basis with whites. “It’s the most shameful moment in baseball history, the original sin,” Reinstein says, adding that since it was broken, “Baseball has certainly sought to atone.” As Reinstein found, there were many voices who called upon the majors to integrate. One of them was Mabray “Doc” Kountze, a Black journalist and author from the Boston suburb of Medford. Kountze’s advocacy included a face-to-face meeting with the owner of the Boston Braves, Bob Quinn, in 1938. “I begin and end the book with Doc Kountze,” Reinstein says. “He strikes me, in many ways, as the quintessential unsung hero in the story, essentially unknown, later relatively anonymous. He was not a celebrity, not powerful, not wealthy. He was really, really dedicated to do something to abolish segregation in baseball. By collaborating with other people, he was able to help do this. He’s the perfect example of an unsung hero.” To the west, in the Steel City, Smith not only celebrated two powerhouse Negro League teams – the Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays – he recommended their players as candidates for the floundering Pittsburgh Pirates. He never heard back, even though the Crawfords’ and Grays’ rosters included some of the all-time greats – such as Paige, Gibson, Judy Johnson and Oscar Charleston. The book discusses Smith’s contemporaries in Black sports journalism – including Nell Dodson Russell, who became perhaps the country’s first Black female sports editor when she was named to that position by the Baltimore Afro-American. She pointed out the disparity between Black and white ballplayers in both pay and working conditions. Black newspapers covering the Negro Leagues got a wider circulation thanks to the covert efforts of the Pullman porters. White advocates for integration included Jews such as Muchnick in Boston, and Lester Rodney in New York. The latter was so passionate about the Negro Leagues that he talked his way onto the staff of the Daily Worker, a communist newspaper that up to that point had downplayed sports. A member of both the American Communist Party and the Baseball Writers of America, Rodney once recommended numerous Black players for Dodgers manager Leo Durocher to sign. The famously acerbic skipper replied, “for a fucking Communist, you sure know your baseball.” During the second world war, Rodney took up an especially persuasive argument for integration. “In many ways, it was the one that got a lot of white people around,” Reinstein says. “He focused on the context of World War Two, the way both Black and white people were now going to war and coming home in boxes … Roosevelt asked Blacks and whites both, if necessary, to die for their country.” Doris Miller, a cook aboard the battleship USS West Virginia, showed initiative during the attack on Pearl Harbor, received the first Navy Cross awarded to a Black sailor, participated in morale-raising efforts and tragically died in the Pacific after returning to action. In Europe, the heroic 761st Tank Battalion – nicknamed the Black Panthers – participated in the Battle of the Bulge and the liberation of the concentration camps. Despite such bravery, “Blacks would come back to a country where they were still second-class citizens,” Reinstein says, adding that Rodney’s arguments “began to resonate. It was a pivotal point.” One member of the 761st was Robinson, a former multi-sport star at UCLA now serving as a lieutenant. He was respected by his white commanding officer, Colonel Paul Bates. When an injury sidelined Robinson from combat, Bates decided that he would accompany the battalion to Europe for morale purposes. Shortly before Robinson’s scheduled departure, he was traveling on a bus back to his base in Texas and was ordered to sit in the back. He refused, and was arrested, then faced a transfer and court-martial. Ultimately, he was cleared, with Bates testifying in his favor. After an honorable discharge, Robinson was playing with the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues when Rickey came calling. “[Rickey] knew if he was going to break the color barrier, it would have to be with a player who was unimpeachable at every level,” Reinstein says. “A real sterling background that opponents would have to respect, Black or white … He found that person in Jackie Robinson, for sure.” The book quotes Countze’s reflection on the historic moment: “As sportswriters, we who ‘spoke out’ were all in it, and a part of it, and we knew the very heart of it. There probably has never been, or ever will be, such a sincerely dedicated and nationally united reform crusade again in American sports history.” ",Sport/Sport,Before Brooklyn: the secret heroes who helped break baseball’s color barrier,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/21/before-brooklyn-the-secret-heroes-who-helped-break-baseballs-color-barrier
2/21/2022,"Michelle, 48, a single mother of three, was stressed, vulnerable and broke. She had recently moved to a new area in Tyne and Wear after escaping an abusive relationship, and when her working hours were cut back at the beginning of the pandemic, money became tight. “It was soul-destroying,” she says. Desperate, and in need of cash for her son’s birthday, she was delighted when another mother at her child’s school offered to lend her £50. The woman said she knew what it was like to need a little extra and that she could pay her back next month. That £50 turned into thousands changing hands, in cash, over several months, with no records kept. “She made it her business to know exactly what days money went in my bank,” says Michelle (whose name has been changed). Forced to pay “double bubble” interest, (the amount of the original loan, plus the same again on top), Michelle soon found the debt spiralling out of control and loan sharks pursuing her.  “I got to the point of wanting to end everything,” says Michelle. “I was suicidal and didn’t know who to go to.” The loan shark resorted to intimidation: she was sent threatening messages; people threw things at her house, left unwanted items on her doorstep and smashed the windows at night. Michelle eventually fled with her children, leaving all her possessions behind, and was placed in temporary accommodation just before Christmas last year. After seeking help from England Illegal Money Lending Team (IMLT), she has since been able to turn her life around. Her circumstances are far from unusual: two-thirds of the victims IMLT helped last year thought they were borrowing from a friend. Michelle is one of about 9 million people who have borrowed more than usual amounts since the start of the pandemic, according to the Office for National Statistics. While not every debtor falls prey to loan sharks, feelings of shame and isolation are widespread among those in severe financial difficulties. Individuals are rarely met with understanding, leading many to blame themselves. But in reality, no one is immune to debt. “I would love to think that the pandemic has made us more understanding, but I don’t think it has,” says Clare Seal, author of Five Steps to Financial Wellbeing. “There’s still a misconception that people are in debt because they are wasting money.” The Covid-19 pandemic has divided the nation’s wealth like never before. With lockdowns curtailing opportunities to splash out, British households built up their savings to the second-highest level on record at the start of the year. But millions of others have lost jobs or been furloughed, plunging them into debt, while a temporary uplift to universal credit has ended. Since March 2020, more than 11 million people have built up £25bn of arrears and debt to pay for essentials, with a smaller group of households facing severe financial distress. As Seal points out, the rise in remote working has accelerated this polarisation. “There’s a stark divide between people who were able to work from home – they have saved on travel expenses, maybe moved out to a city that is more affordable, and are now doing hybrid working long-term – and the people who have lost everything.” “Debt advisers say they have had many first-time callers,” says Laura Whateley, author of Money: A User’s Guide. “Government support has fallen away just as we’re seeing terrifying rises in energy bills, high inflation and no slow down of soaring house prices and rents … We’re only just starting to see the impact.” Seal says that the pandemic has seen a shift away from the type of credit card borrowing that landed her in £27,000 of debt. People are instead turning to buy-now-pay-later platforms, such as Klarna and Clearpay, and salary-advance schemes, which have soared in popularity over the past year. “A change in the way that people borrow isn’t necessarily bad, but these products are unregulated,” she says. Moreover, the high interest charged on these loans means that, for many, they are a curse instead of salvation. According to Whateley, those with “a bad credit rating are often limited to payday loans or extremely high interest lenders, which can lead you down a path of unmanageable debt”. The number of people looking to borrow from friends and family has risen since the start of the pandemic, from 5.1 million in February 2020 up to 5.9 million in October 2020. In some cases, people have turned to strangers, which has helped to cultivate a cottage industry of lenders looking to make extra cash. On Reddit, DIY money-lending communities have seen a surge of activity since lockdown began in the UK. These online spaces – most notably the subreddit r/borrow – allow lenders and borrowers to connect with each other directly, and people turn to the forum as an alternative to payday loans. According to data collected on r/borrow by the Consumer Council, the average interest for UK-based requests was 130%, with the average amount borrowed totalling £148. Any registered Reddit user who meets the account criteria can request a peer-to-peer loan by posting on r/borrow, bypassing the need for any kind of credit check. One user of the subreddit is Ryan Buckley, 30, a stay-at-home dad from West Yorkshire, whose bad credit rating left him with few options during the pandemic. “Having the kids quarantined at home, away from school for more than a year, took its toll on our financial wellbeing,” he says. “We rely on the children having, at minimum, lunch at school. Money just doesn’t stretch as far these days.” Buckley first turned to the subreddit towards the end of last year for short-term emergency loans – first for £30, and then £100 – over the space of two months. He is now paying back a loan of £200 over two months, which was to help with “general shopping” over the Christmas period. Borrowers and lenders on the subreddit often share a distrust of traditional banks and lenders, preferring instead the platform’s human element. As Buckley put it: “You’re borrowing from a real person, not a company, somebody who understands situations, lends with compassion and isn’t trying to extort.” Many lenders on the subreddit claim to be motivated by a desire to help people in need, whether it’s providing loans to those looking to top up universal credit or who need help getting by on furlough payments. But Reddit can be a minefield, and it is not uncommon for a borrower to vanish before repaying a loan. While r/borrow has a reputation for being relatively well moderated, on other subreddits – such as r/loans and r/simpleloans – scamming is even more rife. Abuses by lenders include asking borrowers for unnecessary information for use in scams, including password information, and access to the borrower’s computer. In some cases, this has led to borrowers being conned out of thousands of pounds. According to the Wales IMLT, which is funded by the Financial Conduct Authority to target illegal money lenders, nearly a third of Reddit’s lenders either had no track record of lending, or were subsequently banned from Reddit due to account violations. While Reddit has offered to help some, Catherine Williams at IMLT is concerned about how people are borrowing from these online spaces. “Giving out your bank details to someone you don’t know – that’s a terrifying thing to do,” she says. “Even if they are not a loan shark, if you borrow money from an individual, you are not protected.” Although the moderators of the subreddit help to mediate disputes, provide advice and block users who do not adhere to Reddit’s terms of service, ultimately all loans are treated by Reddit as a civil matter. With regard to the proliferation of money-lending communities on the platform, Reddit says its terms of service “prohibit illegal transactions and we enforce these policies across the platform. We also regularly review subreddits for compliance with our policies. In some instances, we work directly with moderators to ensure users are warned of risks in relevant communities, and many communities impose strict rules and requirements related to user transactions on top of our content policy.” This form of quick, social-media enabled lending is not limited to Reddit. According to the IMLT, the pandemic has seen an increase in reports of illegal money lenders operating on social media platforms – among them Facebook, Craigslist, and Snapchat. Dating apps have also been used as a platform for illegal lending; Williams describes one case in which a Grindr user shared nude photos with a match, from whom they subsequently borrowed money. The person who lent the money eventually threatened to leak those photos if the borrower refused to keep paying. Likewise, on r/borrow, there have been cases of lenders soliciting nude photos as security to ensure payment. But there are safer alternatives for people unable to turn to banks or who cannot afford the high interest rates of payday lenders. Credit unions – local organisations where members pool savings to lend to other members – have proved to be a lifeline for many people during the pandemic. There are about 240 credit unions across the UK, with 1.4 million members. These institutions tend to offer more affordable and lenient repayment terms to those who may struggle to borrow elsewhere. Adam Male, chief executive officer of Kent Savers Credit Union, says that while they “can’t lend to absolutely everyone”, Kent Savers – like many other credit unions – has “a pretty low-bar to entry”. Male says Kent Savers was able to provide support to members unable to repay their loans due to the pandemic. “We’re going to work with the borrower to their advantage, rather than going to a credit department and becoming aggressive.” This is not to say credit unions are the best option for everyone. “The main downside is that rates can be significantly higher on credit union loans than the loans or credit cards you would get from conventional banks. So usually, it is cheaper to borrow elsewhere,” says Whateley. “But for those who can’t access conventional banks because they don’t have a good credit score, this could be a more affordable option than really high-cost lenders.” On top of this, credit unions are rarely able to offer the type of emergency, instant loans that can be sourced elsewhere. Their focus, according to Male, is on long-term loans and offering members a “financial education”. This might mean, for example, encouraging members to build a savings habit by depositing a small amount of money each week. “Credit unions are less in it to make a profit; a lot of the money goes back to the community,” says Seal. But, of course, there is only so much an individual can do when it comes to borrowing. “It’s much easier to look after your financial wellbeing if you have a high-level of privilege. People without privilege and without agency are absolutely reliant on government policy.” To begin to address the Covid debt crisis, Seal says that the government should immediately reintroduce the universal credit uplift and expedite the regulation of buy now, pay later. “Those two changes – one that should never have happened, and one that has been promised for a long time – would make a huge difference,” she says. Until this takes place, more and more people will fall prey to nefarious money lenders, or end up relying on unregulated corners of the internet to make ends meet.",Lifestyle/Money,‘I didn’t know who to go to’: the desperate people trapped by loan sharks and illegal lenders on social media,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/21/i-didnt-know-who-to-go-to-the-desperate-people-trapped-by-loan-sharks-and-lenders-on-social-media
2/21/2022,"This heartfelt, straightforwardish drama from New Zealand ends with a belting cover of Bronski Beat’s LGBTQ+ anthem Smalltown Boy: a song about a young man leaving home to find love and acceptance in the city. Rūrangi picks up a similar story a decade later, when a trans man goes back to the dairy farm where he grew up. It’s a film that thrums with warmth and gives the rest a lesson in how to get trans representation right: all the trans roles are played by trans actors (and for good measure some non-trans – or non-specific – roles too). Elz Carrad gives a likably vulnerable performance as Caz, who ran away as a teenager to Auckland, where he has made a new family in the LGBTQ+ community, transitioned, found work as a trans activist and acquired a gorgeous boyfriend. When Caz arrives back in his home town Rūrangi, all the confidence vanishes. He feels as if he has to explain himself all the time. His dad Gerald (Kirk Torrance) doesn’t recognise him, then struggles to accept him. He also can’t forgive Caz for not coming back for his mum’s funeral. (She died of a rare cancer linked to chemical fertilisers.) Since then, old-school Gerald has become an environmental activist, so, right there you know he is capable of a change of heart.  One of my issues with the film is that in its hurry for happy endings all round, the relationships feel a bit underdeveloped. In flashback, awkwardly edited, we see the crisis in Caz’s Auckland life, the thing that sent him home; like the film itself, the backstory runs along conventional lines. Still, Rūrangi gets by on its sheer warmth and a lovely streak of optimism about human nature.  Rūrangi is released on 25 February in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Rūrangi review – stirring story of a trans man’s homecoming,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/21/rurangi-review-stirring-story-of-a-trans-mans-homecoming
2/21/2022,"In her assured fiction debut, Sheila Armstrong combines unsettling themes with the commonplace and reveals a keen eye for detail. The author, who is originally from Sligo and now lives in Dublin, sets several of these stories in her home country. Lemons is a response to the eighth amendment campaign in 2018. A woman’s life is described in terms of her body: a home abortion is “a pulling from deep inside”, while a mastectomy is “negative space, like a scoop removed from an ice-cream tub”. With an impressive economy, Armstrong distils each passing decade into a few paragraphs. In the title story, a fisherman recounts in meticulous detail the gutting of a mackerel. Written in the second person as a series of numbered points, it builds tension through Armstrong’s deft foreshadowing: “Look your fish in the eye: they say the last thing a man sees is imprinted on his pupil. You check every catch this way for your own reflection, but there is only a dark hole of fright.”  In Red Market, customers bid for a young woman’s organs. The horror is amplified because Armstrong’s country gathering feels so ordinary: the woman is trussed up and put on display “in between the diving hat and the roasting trays”. Armstrong has a talent for disrupting our expectations and her prose is sensorily rich. In Dado, a story about a hit-and-run, “the spit-hot rage of teenage girls lingers in the black ink on the cubicle doors” of a school bathroom. An old man’s grief leaves him “untethered and the days carry him along in their surf”. In Mantis, the narrator compares the “whip-crack thud” of his domestic violence to the “whip-crack claw” of a mantis shrimp. Her evocations of landscape are extraordinary and there’s a satisfying circularity to the collection. It opens with Hole and the night visitors to a field with a “fairy fort”, a ring of stones. It ends with Dome, a typical day at the beach. An image of the sea and the sky meeting memorably concludes this haunting collection.
