4/4/2022,"Here is a walk-and-talk film that brings to mind the nocturnal strolls of Richard Linklater’s Before series. Mari Walker’s feature debut is a quietly volatile anatomy of a past relationship. More than a decade after they have parted ways, Kris (Pooya Mohseni) and Naomi (Lynn Chen) meet again for a trip down memory lane, as the pair spend an evening dining together and visiting their old college stomping ground. Kris has now transitioned, and seeing her former partner as a woman for the first time appears to induce feelings of inferiority in Naomi. In contrast to Kris’s contentment in living her truth, Naomi (who used to be a performance artist in college) is now a dissatisfied shadow of her former self. Bitterness slowly bubbles underneath the playful and friendly facade of the reunion, ultimately boiling over into an explosive argument. But the achilles heel of talky films such as this one is the danger of the writer speaking through the characters instead of allowing dialogue to unfold naturally, and as they touch on issues such as motherhood or sexuality, the conversations between Kris and Naomi occasionally fall into that didactic trap. Even so, Mohseni and Chen share an authentic chemistry that means their line readings sing with emotional vitality. Walker’s film, she is trans herself, is especially commendable in its resistance to moralise; the final spat between Kris and Naomi, where all past resentments rise to the surface, is especially acute in its understanding of how love can culminate in hurtful jabs. Despite its flaws, See You Then is an interesting opportunity to see trans talents in front of and behind the camera.  See You Then is on digital platforms from 11 April.",Arts/Film,See You Then review – bitterness bubbles up as old lovers meet,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/04/see-you-then-review-bitterness-bubbles-up-as-old-lovers-meet
4/4/2022,"“There were two different realities in the room,” writes Gurnaik Johal in the title story of We Move, a debut collection of such precocity and aplomb that it stands comparison to the likes of Junot Díaz and Bryan Washington. In Johal’s stories, different realities are always colliding and occasionally merging into one. This is busy fiction: he alternates viewpoints, builds his effects by accretion of brief details, rarely staying with one character or one scene for more than a page. A striking example is the opening story, Arrival, which last month won the Galley Beggar Press short story prize. (I was one of the judges.) It’s barely 1,500 words long – five pages in the book – but it packs in multitudes. It brings to life a couple, Chetan and Aanshi, who live near Heathrow, have no car and let friends use their drive to save on airport parking. When one acquaintance doesn’t return for her car, they tentatively begin to use it as their own. Johal weaves the way this changes their lives with how they cope as the woman’s fiance turns up to reclaim the vehicle and their speculation on why she didn’t come back. It’s a perfect miniature. Most of the stories are set in the same area – Southall – in what the blurb calls “multicultural London”, where a community rubs shoulders and characters peek into one another’s stories, giving the sense of something larger. Johal covers all the voices: not just young men like him, but also mothers, sisters and older men, sometimes in the same story. One of the best pieces here is Be More Roy, where Mont and Miriam are inhabitants of a nursing home who come to believe they were in a relationship together in their youth. Their new friendship brings them pleasure, despite being based on a past that never existed. Even when Johal sticks to one viewpoint, there is an embracing empathy on display. In Leave to Remain, Gujan takes his grandfather out to have his photograph taken for official documents and they end up cycling the streets, going to the pub and sharing a bucket of chicken wings. Leave to Remain runs to four pages, Be More Roy to eight. Brevity is Johal’s way, making stories that bristle with life while using the minimum information needed for the reader to grasp his meaning. So we get brisk, efficient dialogue, sideways references that describe characters without describing them (“the front door had to be taken off its hinges to let the coffin in”) and precise, evocative imagery: the “white noise” at the bottom of a cappuccino cup; a window being opened and closed to expel smoke, looking from outside like “a small struggling wing”. Johal’s virtuosity would be impressive in a writer of any age and experience, let alone one who is publishing his debut at the age of 23. (Although his insights are universal, I did feel a generation gap opening when a reference appeared to a character having Match Attax football cards, which I buy for my children.) Occasionally, the extremely compact approach works less well. The Twelfth of Never, which spans three centuries in five pages, is oblique to the point of obscurity; in The Red River, a tender and funny relationship story is weakened rather than enhanced by jumping back and forward in short bursts rather than telling it straight. Nonetheless this is a collection to celebrate, from a new talent of the kind that comes along rarely. To describe Johal as a writer to watch would be true but misleading, implying that we need to wait for better things to come. Better to say that he’s a writer to read now.

4/4/2022,"Manchester City are often praised for their ability but Pep Guardiola instead marvelled at their durability. Raheem Sterling recorded two assists at Burnley but his manager talked less about his creativity than his reliability. “He is a guy who can play every three days,” Guardiola said. “He is never injured. We have not got a massively deep squad so it is important to have players like him, Phil [Foden], Riyad [Mahrez] and Bernardo [Silva], who are never injured.” Guardiola knocked on the wood of a Turf Moor desk as he was speaking but there is statistical proof of his flair players’ toughness. Sterling has played 281 times in under six seasons for him. Only João Cancelo has made more appearances for City than Silva this season. Sterling and Mahrez are tied for fourth, behind the Portuguese pair and the goalkeeper Ederson. Their relentlessness as individuals explains City’s as a team. Richard Jolly Match report: Burnley 0-2 Manchester City After the latest torpid display Ralf Rangnick went further than he has done previously when assessing how long it might be before Manchester United might contend for a 21st title. “It takes right decisions: what kind of manager, what kind of players – and then in every transfer window try to get the best. This is not rocket science. If that happens it does not necessarily need three or four years – maybe two or three transfer windows, then the situation could be different.” The key word here is “could”. United are going backwards at lightning pace and the interim manager’s analysis of the squad illuminates the mess. “We spoke about that counterattacking moment we had where they tackled us twice [which presaged Leicester’s goal] and the same was true in a few other moments. It has to [do with] DNA. It is difficult to change a technically great player into an aggressive player and we have a lot of people who are technical.” Jamie Jackson Match report: Manchester United 1-1 Leicester In ordinary circumstances Chelsea’s fans would have been booing the former Tottenham player. Yet rivalry goes out of the window when it comes to Christian Eriksen and it was striking to see the home fans applauding the Dane when he took Brentford’s first corner during their win at Stamford Bridge. It was a reminder that everyone wants Eriksen’s return to go well and while it is natural to worry about the Dane playing again after his cardiac arrest last summer, his ability does not seem to have gone away. There have been no missteps since the 30-year-old’s move to Brentford in January and his performance against Chelsea was proof that he is capable of handling the pace of the Premier League. Chelsea could not cope with Eriksen and his goal to make it 2-1 to Thomas Frank’s side will go down as one of the moments of the season. Jacob Steinberg Match report: Chelsea 1-4 Brentford Jesse Marsch believes in a healthy work-life balance and his Leeds players are rediscovering the benefits of the days off they rarely enjoyed under Marcelo Bielsa. On the pitch the American also preaches balance: between the thrilling intensity of Bielsa’s aggressive high press and the ability to sporadically slow the tempo and control play. “We have a term we call ‘100 to 70,’” said Marsch after Saturday’s 1-1 draw at home to a Southampton side who required one of the impressive James Ward-Prowse’s hallmark free-kicks to earn a point. “It means in certain moments we want the players to slow down a little bit – not always physically, sometimes just in their heads – and have a little bit more poise and control. But when we play at Elland Road the fans don’t want to see 100 to 70, they want to see 100 to 150!” Louise Taylor Match report: Leeds 1-1 Southampton It is not quite awards time but as the remaining games begin to whittle down it is unlikely that anyone will supersede José Sá as Wolves’s signing of the season. There is a strong case for Sá, a £7m arrival on a five-year contract from Olympiakos last summer, being the best value-for-money recruit in the Premier League and his display against Aston Villa, notably repelling their attempts to salvage a point, was typical of his brilliance. Fábio Silva, a £35m record signing, played free of the price tag and João Moutinho, a snip at £5m in 2018, was again authoritative in midfield but Sá, despite conceding a late penalty, ultimately preserved victory in a game that Wolves should have long put to bed. Ben Fisher Match report: Wolves 2-1 Aston Villa Diogo Jota, displaying his versatility by starting on the left of Liverpool’s attack against Watford, had barely had a touch when he showed the high-class movement and predatory instinct that Joe Gomez’s cross deserved to head his team in front at Anfield. It was the 20th goal in all competitions this season from the Portugal international who, thanks to VAR, also won the penalty that enabled Fabinho to seal a 10th successive Premier League win. Jota has emerged as a decisive influence for Jürgen Klopp’s team and, his manager admitted, has been a better player than Liverpool expected when paying Wolves an initial £41m in September 2020. Klopp said: “At Wolves he had a different job and he did that job so good that we thought, ‘We want him.’ And since he came, he improved a lot. That is a little to do with his age, he is growing into the top, world-class striker role step by step. He is the player we thought he would be and also a little bit better.” Andy Hunter Match report: Liverpool 2-0 Watford In August, Leicester looked in great shape, having won the FA Cup and added Patson Daka and Boubakary Soumaré to a squad already bursting with quality. But in April, they sit ninth in the table and the sense is of a season wasted. On Thursday, they entertain PSV Eindhoven in a Conference League quarter-final – but the reality remains that whatever happens there, domestically they are no better off than they were a year ago. The extent to which they’ve been hampered by injuries cannot be underestimated – and how pleasing it is to see Wesley Fofana feeling his way back – but football being football, Brendan Rodgers is under pressure. What he must do now is decide who he wants in his starting XI next August, then use the remaining games of this season to groove the side, shape and style that will keep him his job. Daniel Harris When Spurs lost at Manchester United, their top-four hopes looked fanciful – not because they were out of the race, but because they didn’t look good enough, loose at the back and creatively constipated. But they have improved markedly in the three games since then, beating Brighton, West Ham and Newcastle in convincing fashion. Though the most eye-catching aspect of Sunday’s triumph was the second-half performance of Harry Kane, England’s Shearer-Sheringham partnership in one player and the contribution of Dejan Kulusevski was equally crucial. It’s early days, but already he looks perfect for Antonio Conte and the Premier League, a physical brute brimming with the energy, bravery and drive necessary to exploit a decent touch and sharp brain. He still has plenty of improving to do, but at 21 there is plenty of time in which he can do it – especially with Kane both setting him away and attacking his crosses. Daniel Harris Match report: Tottenham 5-1 Newcastle Michail Antonio is so habitually excellent that there’s a danger he is perhaps taken for granted. He’s only scored once in his last 15 appearances for West Ham, and there has been perhaps a sense that fatigue has begun to sap at him as the lack of a replacement means he effectively has to play every week, but he led the line superbly on Sunday. Michael Keane’s second yellow card looked stupid – was stupid – but it was the result of the way Antonio had dragged hm this way and that, overwhelming him both physically and with his movement, never giving him a moment of peace. It was his run and shot that led to Jarrod Bowen’s winner and as well as his three shots, he also completed three key passes. The goals will return, but even without them, Antonio is a vital presence in this West Ham side. Jonathan Wilson Match report: West Ham 2-1 Everton Fans assuming that purchasing a ticket entitles them to shout whatever they want at whoever they want – behaviour that also infects what passes for contemporary public discourse – is one of the worst things about football. There were not many bright spots at the Amex – Norwich look as doomed as they’ve always done, Brighton were as profligate as they always are – but the response to Neal Maupay’s substitution was one. Maupay departed the pitch having missed three good chances and a penalty, so the home fans – who’ve not seen a goal, never mind a win, since the middle of January – might have sent him off with some choice invective. But instead they consoled their player with the ovation he needed to hear, a nice moment on an otherwise miserable afternoon.

4/4/2022,"Former New South Wales minister Pru Goward and a former chief of staff to Scott Morrison are among six people with Liberal links appointed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal among 19 appointments. On Monday the attorney general, Michaelia Cash, announced that Goward and Ann Duffield had been appointed senior members, jobs that receive pay of at least $330,000 a year, if employed on a full time basis, for up to seven years. The AAT appointments and separate jobs for former federal minister John McVeigh and NSW minister, Don Harwin, have sparked concerns of a repeat of 2019, when a Guardian Australia analysis found that one in five of those appointed to government bodies in the fortnight before the election was called had Liberal or National party links. Duffield is a lobbyist for DPG Advisory Solutions and a former chief of staff to then-attorney general Phillip Ruddock, and Morrison while he was immigration minister before she left that role in February 2015. Goward is a biographer of former Liberal prime minister John Howard, and represented Goulburn for 12 years in the NSW parliament, including a stint as family and community services minister. Labor has repeatedly criticised the Coalition for the number of appointments to the AAT from the conservative side of politics, claiming that 85 members appointed since the 2013 election have Liberal or National links. The tribunal is responsible for merits appeals against government decisions in areas including social security, the national disability insurance scheme, freedom of information and immigration. Among the 19 new appointments are two former Liberal members of the Western Australian parliament who lost their seats at the March state election: Michael Mischin, who was appointed deputy president and will receive pay of $496,650; and Peter Katsambanis, appointed a member. Cash appointed Kate Chapple, a senior adviser to foreign minister Marise Payne and former senior adviser to then-defence minister Linda Reynolds, as a member. Cheryl Cartwright, who worked for Alexander Downer in opposition and was then chief of staff to Warren Truss as agriculture minister in the Howard government, was also appointed a member.

On Monday the arts minister, Paul Fletcher, appointed Harwin, the former NSW arts minister, to the Australia Council board. Harwin resigned from the NSW ministry in April 2020 after he was fined $1,000 for staying at his Central Coast holiday home in breach of a Covid-19 public health order. On Monday the water minister, Keith Pitt, appointed former Liberal MP John McVeigh as the chair of the modernising Murray river systems technical panel. McVeigh is a former minister for regional development and briefly served in Malcolm Turnbull’s cabinet after the December 2017 reshuffle. Pitt said the role would “look for water infrastructure opportunities that could improve delivery and reliability of water rights in the southern basin”.",News/Australia news,Pru Goward among six Liberal-linked appointments by Coalition to Administrative Appeals Tribunal,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/04/pru-goward-among-six-liberal-linked-appointments-by-coalition-to-administrative-appeals-tribunal
4/4/2022,"It is far from an exact science, taking a nation’s pulse from what it’s drinking. Cocktail sociology tends, alas, to be looked down upon by the Academy. The field is sadly overreliant on the datasets of second-rate spiced rum brands. Still, cocktails are, apparently, selling in record numbers: they accounted for almost one-tenth of alcohol sales in bars and restaurants between April and October 2020, compared with 6% before the pandemic; and the at-home cocktail market has grown 44% year on year. Why the explosion in popularity? As someone who has spent a few negronis correlating vermouth trends with socio-economic factors, I think there are two conclusions to draw. The first is that the British will use anything as an excuse to drink: crash, plague, war, depression, we’re not fussy. At-home sales of alcohol increased by 24% in the year from March 2020. Not only did at-home drinking nearly cancel out the losses of bars and restaurants during lockdown (overall alcohol sales were only down by 1.2%), it changed what we were drinking: the five o’clock cocktail ritual became an anchor amid the amorphous days and a proxy for all the things we couldn’t do: travel, socialise, laugh. It’s also far less effort making a margarita than making sourdough. As a result, beer was down 14%; spirits were up 7.3%. Waitrose reported that pandemic tequila sales went up by 175% with liqueur sales rising by 78%. Now restrictions have eased, we’re seeing another mini-boom. Pubs and bars have filled once more – their main problem is finding enough staff – but now customers know precisely how much vermouth they like in their martini. AG Barr, the Scottish sugary drink manufacturer, found a 13% increase in customers ordering cocktails compared to pre-pandemic, and the trend for home mixing continues unabated. “Gin is up. Rum is up. Everything is up,” reports Dawn Davies, head buyer of the retailer the Whisky Exchange. “It’s a bit: ‘What cost of living crisis?’” Of course, the picture is a little more complicated than that: millions cut back during the pandemic; the longer term trend is that we are drinking less anyway; and for me at least, the move to cocktails is about drinking less but drinking better. A beer is a release after a long day – a cocktail is an event, a treat, a promise of an extravagant evening to come. Moreover we are already a couple of decades into what bartending types call the “second golden age of the cocktail” – taking the 1910s-30s as the first golden age. When I first started mixing, in 2008 or so, it was hard to find the key ingredients in non-specialist retailers. Now there is a passable crème de violette in Lidl and ready-to-drink porn star martinis in M&S. But that brings me to the second overarching trend: the affinity between hard times and hard liquor. The American drink historian David Wondrich dates the current revival to post-9/11 New York. It was in the early 2000s, as New York entered its hipster phase, that bartenders began poring over old-timey bar manuals and coming up with modern classics such as the paper plane and the French pearl. The movement really got going in Britain post-financial crash – which is when the boom in craft gin distilleries began in earnest. Cocktails that were derided in the 1960s as fusty, old-fashioned things (“I will not be part of her cocktail generation partner’s waltz,” sang baby boomer icon Don McLean), and in the 1990s as tacky, synthetic, things (this was the era of the dreaded Long Island iced tea) turn out to be the ideal accompaniments to these frightening and frivolous times. They are celebration and consolation in one. Indeed, viewed en large, there’s also a more specific correlation between the popularity of cocktails and economic inequality. The first high point of cocktails was in the age of the robber barons, rampant deregulation, boom and bust. The low point coincided with the postwar settlement of 1945-79 or so, les trente glorieuses as the French call them, when (as Thomas Piketty showed in his Capital in the 21st Century) average incomes in the west rose in line with strong overall economic growth. At this point, egalitarian beer and aspirational wine were the things to drink. Cocktails hit the mainstream again only as incomes yawned apart. Will they endure? I doubt all those garden hot tubs and Peloton subscriptions will survive the cost of living crisis. But some luxuries are bomb-proof. Lipstick is one. Martinis are another. These are relatively affordable ways of escaping reality for a moment. I suspect we’ll be sinking them for a while yet.

4/4/2022,"As China makes progress on a security deal with Solomon Islands, the Australian government is anxious not to be seen to have “dropped the ball” in the Pacific region. That would be a tad embarrassing, given it has spent the past few years sounding the alarm about security threats from China while also trumpeting its own “Pacific Step-Up”. The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has been one of the ministers on the defensive after leaked documents revealed the draft agreement between China and the Pacific island nation. “Look, I think it would be highly naive to think that the Australian government is not completely all over this issue,” the deputy prime minister told reporters in Canberra. “The prime minister, the national security committee – they’re not fools.” But even though there was a general understanding of Beijing’s interest in deeper ties with Solomon Islands, it is increasingly clear the leaked agreement – spelling out a system for the Pacific country to request assistance from Chinese police, armed police, military personnel and other armed forces – took Canberra by surprise. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said as much when she was asked to reveal when she first became aware of the proposed deal. “In relation to this framework agreement, when it became public – I think it was a social media post on 24 March,” Payne told a Senate estimates hearing on Friday. What about when Australia first became aware of the prospect of an agreement? “When this was a public document,” Payne answered. One of the reasons defence planners in Canberra would have been seriously alarmed by the draft agreement is because it appeared quite broadly worded, and could conceivably be a stepping stone to a future Chinese naval base less than 2,000km from Australia’s east coast. In the short term, such a presence could fuel geopolitical tensions and instability in the Pacific. In the longer term, Australian strategists would have to factor in the risk of disruptions to supply lanes between the US and Australia in a future crisis. Lt Gen Greg Bilton, the chief of joint operations for the Australian defence force, told reporters it “does change the calculus if Chinese navy vessels are operating from Solomon Islands”, adding that it “would change the way that we would undertake day‑to‑day operations particularly in the air and at sea”. According to the draft text, the agreement would give China an avenue to “make ship visits to, carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands”, while Chinese forces could also be used “to protect the safety of Chinese personnel and major projects in Solomon Islands”. Since the document leaked, Solomon Islands has insisted it has no intention of allowing a Chinese naval base, and has said the final version may be worded differently. But the prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, has signalled his determination to press ahead, saying the agreement is merely an extension of its “friends to all and enemies to none” foreign policy. The specific draft document came as a shock, but it wasn’t a bolt from the blue. Australia and New Zealand were aware of China’s interest in closer police cooperation with Solomon Islands (“the direction of travel”, as Jacinda Ardern called it last week). There has been awareness for months about the prospect of China providing police-to-police training in the country. Last month concerns were raised about secrecy surrounding a shipment from China of items that Solomon Islands police described as replica firearms for police training. Ewen McDonald, the head of the Office of the Pacific at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, adopted Joyce’s remarks at Senate estimates on Friday. McDonald – who visited Honiara in January and February – assured senators Australia had been “all over this issue of security” and the desire for China “to enter that sector” since at least 2019. That was when Solomon Islands ended ties with Taiwan and switched diplomatic recognition to the People’s Republic of China. The latest developments present a substantial challenge for Australian diplomacy, and for security planning. The Australian government is well aware of the need to avoid any perception it is bullying or lecturing to Solomon Islands. The Australian government’s policy in the Indo-Pacific for years has focused on promoting a region “of independent, sovereign and resilient states”. Read that as: every country, regardless of size, is able to make its own decisions free of coercion. As Richard Maude, former head of the Office of National Assessments and an experienced foreign affairs official, explains, the Australian government should raise its concerns quietly because “any perception that we’re leaning on the Solomon Islands government would be counterproductive”. Sogavare rebuffed foreign criticism of the security negotiations with Beijing in a speech to his country’s parliament on Tuesday, declaring: “We find it very insulting, Mr Speaker, to be branded as unfit to manage our sovereign affairs.” China’s foreign ministry also warned other countries against telling Solomon Islands what to do “in a condescending manner”. But the agreement is also contentious within the domestic politics of Solomon Islands. Matthew Wale, the leader of the opposition, argued it “would make the Solomons a geopolitical playing field” and “further threaten the nation’s fragile unity”. In an op-ed for the Guardian, Wale wrote: “The Solomons’ relationships with its regional partners are not perfect. The US, Australia and New Zealand have, to varying degrees, been neglectful in the region over the past decade – particularly regarding the existential threat posed by climate change. But the proposed security deal with China is not the solution.” The Australian government appears to be attempting to avoid inflaming the situation with excessive public commentary. Even the defence minister, Peter Dutton, who is not generally known for nuance when it comes to China-related issues, has been cautious. “They’re a sovereign nation and they have the ability to make decisions for themselves and we fully respect that and they’ll do what they believe is in their country’s best interest,” Dutton told ABC Radio National on Friday. Indeed, the Australian government’s strategy appears to be largely focused on ensuring that the concerns about the deal are not primarily seen as a just bilateral issue between Australia and Solomon Islands. Instead, it is emphasising the broader implications for regional security. Morrison had calls with his counterparts from Papua New Guinea and Fiji last Monday. Similarly, David Panuelo, the president of the Federated States of Micronesia, which is close to the US, wrote to Sogavare on Wednesday to express concern that the “novel and unprecedented” security agreement “would absolutely affect all countries who call the Blue Pacific their home”. Panuelo appealed to Sogavare: “If any part of what I have written has given you pause, however briefly, then please feel empowered to reach out to me, and to the Pacific Islands Forum at large.” A second element of the Australian government’s strategy seems to be to cast doubt on China’s long-term intentions and the reliability of any pledges it makes. Dutton has pointed to the assurances China’s president, Xi Jinping, gave to then US president Barack Obama in the Rose Garden at the White House in 2015 that “China does not intend to pursue militarisation” in the South China Sea. Dutton said China now had 20 points of military presence in the South China Sea, and its record showed it was “very hard” to take Beijing’s promises “at face value”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A third element of Australia’s approach is to emphasise its own ongoing commitment to assisting Solomon Islands. There are currently about 60 Australian federal police and defence force personnel in Solomon Islands, after unrest in November last year, and that mission has been extended to next year. Australia’s official development assistance (ODA) to Solomon Islands appeared to decline from 12.6% from $179m in 2014-15 to $156m in the 2021-22 budget, but there are additional targeted programs, including Covid-related support. Last week’s budget showed the country would gain $161.1m in ODA in 2022-23. Payne said Australia was Solomon Islands’ largest development partner “by a long way”, providing about two-thirds of all assistance, and added that it stood ready to act on any other requests. “There is not one single event or ask that Australia has not been prepared to meet, in my experience,” she said of crisis and disaster response. In other words, we’re here to help; no need to reach beyond the immediate region for assistance. The Australian government will be hoping that message resonates when it comes time for Solomon Islands to make its sovereign decision.",News/World news,Australia anxious to show it didn’t ‘drop the ball’ on Pacific after China and Solomon Islands deal,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/australia-anxious-to-show-it-didnt-drop-the-ball-on-pacific-after-china-and-solomon-islands-deal
