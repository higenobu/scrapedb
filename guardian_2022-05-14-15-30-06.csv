5/14/2022,"In recent years, much of the most innovative work in the anglophone short story has come from Ireland, from writers such as Colin Barrett, Wendy Erskine and Nicole Flattery. New debut collections by gifted British authors Saba Sams and Gurnaik Johal have shown the unmistakable influence of their Irish peers. The publication of Reward System by Cambridge-born Jem Calder provides further evidence that the medium is attracting some of the most talented young writers of fiction at work today, on both sides of the Irish sea. Strictly speaking, Reward System isn’t quite a short story collection. It’s a book of six tales, most of which are slightly interlinked through the reappearance of two main characters, and one of which – about an assistant chef in a restaurant kitchen who has an affair with her older boss – is long enough to be classed as a novella. But as up-to-date as these stories feel, Reward System belongs firmly in the tradition of fictional miniaturism: Calder’s stories are all granular portraits of micro-interactions between people in ostensibly mundane settings, tapped out on six inches of LCD glass. The book’s world is that of young Londoners: rent-squeezed, smartphone-addicted, woke-ish (but, more often than not, concerned they’re not woke enough). They are not, it must be said, contented souls: they tend to spend their work hours at “purgatorial, underpaid desk jobs” and their free time attending vaguely humiliating social gatherings or on romantic downward spirals mediated by “algorithm-based dating apps” that make them feel like “holographic” versions of themselves. One, at his work desk, concludes he has “formatted his entire personality around the feeling of just sitting here, letting his precious life-moments pass him by like it doesn’t mean anything”. Another has a sense of “touristic irresponsibility towards a life that seems to end at the limits of his field of vision”. Calder’s view of contemporary reality feels several notches darker and more jaded than, say, Flattery’s or Sally Rooney’s. So why doesn’t a single page here feel dour or depressing to read? Quite simply because Calder is a superb writer, by turns funny, graceful, acidly cynical, lyrical – and always verbally dexterous and inventive. He can make the boredom of office life fascinating, as in Search Engine Optimisation; he can make a desolate house party enlivening, as in Better Off Alone; and his descriptions of loneliness and dissatisfaction, as in virtually all these stories, leave the reader feeling understood – or, as his characters would say, seen. One of his favoured techniques is to defamiliarise ordinary actions or objects with comically precise description: a character doesn’t use a vape but “cartridges of glycerine-based, nicotine-salt-containing syrup from a vaporiser identical in shape and weight to a standard USB flash drive”. But he can also write simply and beautifully, with a keen eye for the natural world and human behaviour. An “overcast midday sky” is “the colour of the Financial Times”; rain falls “invisible in mid-air but manifesting as a constellation of discoloured discs out on the road and pavement”. And there is a real tenderness in the way he follows his two sort-of protagonists, Nick and Julia, who were once lovers and whose orbits cross several times. A theme that recurs in Calder’s writing is secrecy. His characters are frequently anxious about – though occasionally comforted by – the fact that they are all constantly being tracked by apps that know them better than they know themselves. Third-person fiction is, in a sense, an app that practises gross invasions of privacy. Reward System shows us its characters in every form of compromising activity: one pisses in another’s bathroom sink, for no special reason; one spends hours filming herself on her laptop miming ordinary activities, then watching herself back; everyone stalks each other online. But there is compassion, even love, in the way Calder describes these shameful moments, as though by observing them so empathically he restores his characters’ integrity. And occasionally the narrator seems to recede from the characters and leave them, for a moment, with the dignity of inviolable solitude – as when one woman turns her smartphone off and we simply read: “Whether or not she absently ran her fingers over the soft underside of her chin as she watched the passing world and considered her place in it, the algorithm could not say.”  Matt Rowland Hill’s memoir Original Sins is published by Chatto.

5/14/2022,"At Wood Green school in Witney, Oxfordshire, a group of year 7 pupils are trying to convince classmates that scientists have taught spinach to send emails. Next door another class is being challenged to speak for 40 seconds, along the lines of Radio 4’s Just a Minute, on the subject “what is under the bed?” Their peers might be doing a public speaking class, a session focusing on their own health and wellbeing, or taking part in community service or a Duke of Edinburgh award, which all pupils are expected to complete. The lessons in how to spot fake news, in oracy, debating, teamwork and emotional intelligence aren’t attempts to undermine the Gove-ite traditional curriculum. Pupils at Wood Green do all the expected academic subjects and take public exams such as GCSEs and A-levels. Many schools offer these enrichment opportunities. But at Wood Green the school’s leadership team is pioneering the idea of assessing pupils’ achievements in all these areas and awarding its own “baccalaureate” as part of a campaign launched this month aiming to radically change the way secondary education is organised in England. Baccalaureate awards aren’t new. Wales already has one and the international baccalaureate is one of the most successful global qualifications, celebrated for its promise to develop “a broad range of human capacities” and requiring pupils to complete projects in creativity, activity and public service as well as achieving academic success. Wood Green’s headteacher, Rob Shadbolt, realised he wanted something similar to this for his school years ago after a meeting with local employers and the then local MP and prime minister, David Cameron. “I asked how the education policy of the government created young people with the skills that these employers wanted. He [Cameron] replied that what employers needed was employees with good maths and English,” said Shadbolt. “Although no one disagreed with the importance of numeracy and literacy, the employers in the room said they prioritised young people who could communicate, work well with others and by themselves, and who showed initiative. “Turning out grades 4 or 5 in a maths or English GCSE, although important, isn’t enough. Broader opportunities are built into education in private schools. Why shouldn’t every child have that entitlement? This is about social justice as well.” Shadbolt’s thinking prompted him to join the National Baccalaureate Trust, an offshoot of the Headteachers’ Roundtable thinktank, which came together on Twitter 10 years ago out of frustration at Michael Gove’s “English baccalaureate” idea. Critics argue that Gove’s Ebacc, which judges schools on how many pupils achieve a good pass in a small number of academic subjects, is nothing like the real thing, and Tom Sherrington, a former headteacher and founder member of the HTRT, has been working with other heads since then to devise a qualification more aligned to the IB than the Gove model. The national baccalaureate would be a final qualification at 18 and include pupils’ results in GCSEs, A-levels and vocational qualifications, as well as other achievements in the arts, sport, project work and civic activity. Crucially, campaigners believe, this would help to minimise the status divide between academic and technical routes by unifying them under one award. “Young people’s educational careers are too defined in terms of a collection of exam results, with too little regard for technical education, creative learning, and personal development,” says Sherrington. “So many of those judged to be at the lower end of the attainment range are denied the opportunity to leave school with a fair record of their successes and achievements, however hard they work. We believe a successful education encompasses so much more than this.” The proposal, which has been subject to a lengthy consultation with professionals, was launched last week on the website Rethinking Assessment, almost 20 years after a similar idea for an all-encompassing diploma at 18, crafted by the former Ofsted chief inspector Sir Mike Tomlinson, was rejected by the then prime minister Tony Blair. But after the saga of exam cancellations, failed algorithms and controversial teacher assessments during the pandemic, and a growing unease about the extent to which exams dominate the education system, some campaigners are keen to go faster than a new qualification that still includes GCSEs and A-levels. The Tory MP and chair of the education select committee, Robert Halfon, has proposed abolishing GCSEs altogether and replacing them with a baccalaureate qualification at 18. Peter Hyman, the former Downing Street adviser and now co-director of the Big Education academy trust, has called for a final pupil “transcript”, which would give credits for a range of projects and skills over a pupil’s entire school life. The Conservative One Nation group also supports the baccalaureate idea and believes it would contribute to the government’s levelling up agenda. The Conservative MP Flick Drummond said she didn’t believe the existing curriculum was fit for purpose. “We need to have a 14-18 curriculum with one set of exams/assessment at the end, at 18, which would include both academic and vocational qualifications, including apprenticeships, and give young people a wide-ranging portfolio to present to the next stage, whether that is university or work,” she said. “I am particularly concerned that we are putting so much emphasis on passing exams that are not engaging young people. They should be relevant and useful. By waiting until 18 to assess young people, they will have the maturity to understand the relevance of what they are doing, and we should make sure that vocational qualifications are seen as on a par with academic ones.” Sherrington thinks the time may not yet be right for the outright abolition of GCSEs. “A baccalaureate is a really good way to talk about exams because you don’t have to talk in binary terms about having them or not. You can include them in a wider award that assesses pupils in other ways. And have far fewer exams that aren’t as high stakes.” At Wood Green school, Shadbolt agrees that a first stage would be to put a baccalaureate framework around what schools are already doing. “We are crediting all learning and personal development in our school, but we would welcome external accreditation that valued a wider range of attributes, and unified academic and vocational qualifications. A government commitment to this would be such a transformational step forward for schools.”",News/Education,How an Oxfordshire school created its own enriching baccalaureate,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/14/how-an-oxfordshire-school-created-its-own-enriching-baccalaureate
5/14/2022,"Cool, crunchy and refreshing, cucumbers are like a breeze in a bowl. And there is a lot more to them beyond green salad and sandwiches. They’re the ideal foil for hot weather and spicy food, and pair particularly well with anything lactic, such as yoghurt or buttermilk, or briny, such as soy sauce or vinegar. Long, English cucumbers are as wet as the country’s weather, which makes them ideal for elegant, cold summer soups, cordials and cocktails, while the short, crisp Persian variety holds its shape and texture, making it perfect for pickles, salads or just munching with a sprinkle of sea salt. This cooling soup is ideal for savouring in the garden as the weather heats up; it also makes a rather lovely drink if served in a tumbler.

Put the vinegar, sugar and 150ml water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the sliced chilli, then take off the heat and leave to cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, peel and halve the cucumbers, remove and discard the seeds, then chop the flesh into 5mm dice. Add to the cooled pickling liquor, then put in the fridge to chill and lightly pickle for at least an hour (that said, the pickle can be made up to a day in advance). To make the soup, melt the butter in a saucepan over a medium heat, then saute the onion until it’s soft and translucent, but not coloured. Add the cumin, allspice, cinnamon and bay leaf, and fry for a minute or two, until the spices release their fragrance. Scatter in the sliced garlic and chopped cucumbers and fry for eight to 10 minutes, until the cucumbers are tender. Remove and discard the bay leaf, then tip the mix into a food processor and blend smooth. Refrigerate until cool, then fold in the buttermilk, season to taste and pass through a fine sieve. Refrigerate again until needed. Divide the soup between four bowls. Drain the pickled cucumber from its liquor, discard the chilli and put the cucumber in a medium bowl. Stir in the dill, parsley and capers, spoon a little salad over each serving, scatter with a pinch of za’atar and enjoy.

5/14/2022,"With the US supreme court apparently poised to overturn the 1973 landmark decision which made abortion legal, hundreds of thousands of people across America are planning to take to the streets to protest the looming decision. A coalition of groups such as Planned Parenthood, UltraViolet, MoveOn and the Women’s March are organizing Saturday’s demonstrations, whose rallying cry is “Bans Off Our Bodies”. More than 370 protests are planned, including in Washington DC, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. The demonstrations come after the leak on 2 May of a draft opinion showing five conservatives on the nine-justice supreme court had voted to reverse their predecessors’ ruling in Roe v Wade nearly 50 years ago. Unless the provisional ruling is changed substantially before becoming final, abortion would be outlawed essentially immediately in more than half of US states. People in those 26 states hostile to abortion would be forced to either travel hundreds of miles to a clinic in a state where terminating a pregnancy is legal or seek to self-administer an abortion through medication from grassroots or illicit groups. While conservatives have celebrated the leak ruling, liberals have objected vociferously, gathering outside the supreme court building in Washington DC as well as the homes of some of the conservative justices to signal their displeasure. Those rallies – generally peaceful – have been relatively small, while Saturday’s planned events will almost certainly be compared to the 2017 Women’s March the day after Donald Trump was inaugurated as president, which drew an estimated 3 million to 4 million participants across the US. The “Bans Off Our Bodies” gatherings will take place three days after Democrats in the US Senate on Wednesday made a largely symbolic effort to advance legislation that would codify the right to an abortion into federal law. All 50 Republicans and one conservative-aligned Democrat – West Virginia’s Joe Manchin – voted against the measure, leaving it well short of the 60 votes necessary for it to advance.",News/World news,Demonstrators across the US protest expected reversal of Roe v Wade,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/14/protests-abortion-rights-cities-roe
5/14/2022,"Legal arguments were not the only thing under such heavy scrutiny at the high court this week. The media coverage of the “Wagatha Christie” libel trial has seen the sartorial choices of all involved under rigorous examination. Headlines such as “Rebekah Vardy teams £1,316 vintage Chanel dress with £650 bag” and “Coleen Rooney arrives at court in £1,565 Mugler blazer and (one) £615 Gucci loafer” – a reference to Rooney’s ankle boot – have been displayed online as prominently as any cross-examination. Even Coleen’s husband Wayne – a man more used to being judged on a football pitch – has been condemned by the fashion jury. Wearing an immaculate navy raincoat and holding a black Fendi bag as he walked down the court’s steps with Coleen, he has been likened to a “suicidal bouncer” and a PE teacher roped in to cover geography. However, it is still the women that photographers have jostled for the best shot of the two women arriving, making it clear they not only have to prepare for the verdict of the judge, but also for the rest of the world. “We have to recognise the scrutiny that famous women are under is hugely intensified in this environment,” said Dr Kirsty Fairclough of Manchester Metropolitan University. “Every detail is getting attention.” But there is power in clothes, something two media-savvy celebrities will be all too aware of. This also means there could be intention behind the choices, she added: “There is often an entire team around celebrities that is responsible for that image. It’s all highly choreographed, highly performative”. Vardy has been going all out on the celebrity-meets-royal dressing, wearing pieces by designers previously worn by the Duchess of Cambridge. “She’s showing us she’s the more refined person,” said the fashion psychologist Carolyn Mair. Meanwhile, Rooney has stayed closely aligned to the high street, wearing a monochromatic Zara dress. “Coleen is showing her allegiance to the rest of us,” said Mair. “She’s dressing for the people so that they empathise with her.” The repeated use of tailoring and “the stronger shoulder” by both women shows that “They want to be taken seriously and show they are in control,” said the image consultant Penny Bennett. Stateside, the media attention around Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s dock dressing – while they battle out their his’n’hers defamation suits in Virginia – has been no less intense. Heard’s decision to copy Depp’s suits and a particular Gucci “bee” tie has also generated fevered speculation. Decoding these looks can only ever be a matter of conjecture, however. “That’s always the issue with fashion,” said Mair. “Unless there’s a slogan that makes it clear, it can be interpreted in lots of different ways.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,‘Wagatha Christie’: the sensational court battle that became a fashion face-off,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/14/wagatha-christie-the-sensational-court-battle-that-became-a-fashion-face-off
5/14/2022,"‘Nutrition is one of the hardest sciences to do well,” says Graham Lawton, a science writer whose first book, This Book Could Save Your Life, aimed to debunk a number of contemporary health fads. “Humans are terrible research subjects,” he says. “Recording what they actually eat is virtually impossible, they either forget or they lie.” And, he says, “everybody’s different. Everyone has a different gut microbiome and metabolism.” While Lawton is clear that it’s almost impossible to pull out any kind of generalisation, there is some consensus over the sorts of food we might want to prioritise at various life stages. Generally speaking, ultra-processed foods are always best avoided regardless of age, due to the high sugar, salt and artificial trans fats that characterise them (also called “partially hydrogenated oils”, artificial trans fats can be found in hard margarine, fast food and commercially produced baked goods, and have been so closely linked to heart disease that they have been banned in Denmark, Switzerland, Austria and certain US states). As for everything else? “It’s about moderate doses,” says Lawton. Here’s what to eat by age. What to eat: leafy greens, eggs and full-fat dairy The NHS recommends that parents start weaning their children at around six months old. “This is because there’s not enough iron in breast milk, so mum and the baby can become anaemic,” explains Sophie Medlin, dietitian and London Chair of the British Dietetic Association. Eggs are a powerful choice even at this age, though the NHS says eggs without the Red Lion label are not suitable to be eaten raw (for example in homemade mayonnaise). and “adding iron-rich vegetables to meals such as spinach and broccoli, which are easy to puree, is great,” says Medlin. Rachel Ward is a GP in Oxfordshire. She recommends parents use full-fat milk, full-fat yoghurts and full-fat cheese for the under twos, “because of their fast growth rate. They are using up a lot of energy and they’ll need it,” she says. Ward stresses the importance of introducing children to a variety of food at the earliest opportunity. “We know the first time they try fruit and vegetables, they won’t like them, but it is important that you keep going because that’s the building blocks of a broad and balanced diet.” What to eat: seeds, tofu and semi-skimmed milk “This period is really rapid for bone growth,” says Medlin. “So it’s about making sure they eat lots of calcium-rich food. Dairy is optimal.” By now, Ward suggests they’re switched to semi-skimmed milk and lower fat dairy options – for example, creme fraiche over cream – as part of forming healthy habits. “Iron also remains important, so keep pushing a range of vegetables,” she says. For calcium-rich plant-based alternatives, “seeds and tofu are excellent,” says Medlin, with sunflower, chia, poppy and sesame being some of the most powerful. What to eat: pulses, lean meats, dried fruits, and flavours from around the world (ideally cooked as a family) “The diet should be balanced and nutrient rich,” says Ward. “Fruit and veg, lean meat, and pulses. Parents should also try to build up an array of foods using new flavours and ingredients from different countries.” For maximum impact, make cooking a team effort. “Encourage the kids to take ownership of their diet so they have a good repertoire of recipes,” she says. “It’s not going to be long before they have left home and you want them to have the skills to eat healthily.” Once again, iIron is important, especially for girls experiencing the onset of menstruation: eggs, spinach and dried fruits are good sources. What about teenage skin? “That’s hormonal, there’s not a lot you can do about that through diet,” says Medlin. What to eat: foods rich in B vitamins “At this phase in your life, health is on your side, and you can feel a little bit invincible,” reflects Ward. “But it’s still important to look at what you’re putting into your body, and understanding it has consequences. Something we see in this age group is alcohol excess, which can be detrimental if people get into the habit of drinking without food.” Medlin says the lifestyle changes in our 20s – some of them being alcohol, caffeine and stress – are a “perfect storm” for B12 deficiencies, especially as plant-based diets take off. “Foods rich in B vitamins are animal products like meat, fish, dairy and eggs. But iIf you’re vegan, you can use nutritional yeast to add extra B12 to your diet, andfocus on those green leafy vegetables.” What to eat: whole grains The likes of pearl barley, oats and brown rice have a number of benefits for people in their 30s. Firstly, around this age, fertility may be on the agenda, so women trying to conceive could benefit from dialling up their consumption of folate to reduce the risk of neural tube defects like spina bifida. Good sources of folate include liver, dark leafy greens and whole grains. Men could also benefit from keeping an eye on their B vitamins – again, whole grains are a good source, and they also promote feeling fuller for longer, which can help maintain a healthy weight. “A lot of people get to their 30s and suddenly their bowels don’t like certain foods, so gut health becomes more important. For that, you’d want to be focusing on high-fibre food,” says Medlin. And what’s a good source of fibre? Whole grains. What to eat: occasionally, nothing “As we move into ageing processes, we need antioxidants to protect our skin and body,” says Medlin. Antioxidants work by neutralising unstable atoms in the body called free radicals. Free radicals cause cell damage and occur in the body through ageing and environment (for example, due to pollution and stress). You can find antioxidants in brightly coloured fruit and veg so it’s important to eat them, not take them in a pill or applied in a cream. “They don’t work unless eaten, for reasons that aren’t well understood,” says Lawton. “One theory is that they work by hormesis.” This is a biological process where a small amount of something harmful has beneficial effects. “So the antioxidant plants are mildly poisonous in order to keep insects off, and our body reacts to this insult by ramping up its protective mechanisms.” If eating to slow ageing is your aim, Lawton only has one recommendation:s fasting. “There’s something called autophagy: if you deprive your body of nutrients for an extended period of time, your body has to find alternative sources of energy. So it finds loads of gubbins in your cells – bits of protein, old organelles, the cellular damage – and it burns them. It’s like cleaning out loads of old crap from inside you.” Fasting is associated with better metabolic health, and in animal experiments “has been tried on every conceivable animal from insects through to macaques, extending their lifespans by up to 50%”. What to eat: more olive oil, less butter “In our 50s we want to be focusing on weight management, as well as diabetes and heart disease prevention,” says Medlin. “So it might be the time to start switching saturated fat for unsaturated fats.” But what does this mean? There are different types of fat in the food we eat, and sSaturated fats are the ones linked to high cholesterol. Many animal foods are high in saturated fats – butter, meat, cheese. “A good rule of thumb is that saturated fats tend to come from animals and are solid at room temperature,” says Lawton, “while unsaturated fats tend to derive from plants, and are liquid at room temperature.” Olive oil is a common unsaturated vegetable fat. “There’s not been a lot of clarity on saturated fats,” reflects Lawton. “They were demonised based on less than rigorous research on the Mediterranean diet. That research was done in Greece at a time when people were fasting for religious reasons, so they were eating mostly fish and vegetables and olive oil. But they usually eat quite a lot of lamb, which is high in saturated fat. More recently, there’s been a saturated fats renaissance, particularly with butter.” But according to Lawton the bottom line is: “saturated fats are a perfectly healthy and essential part of a balanced diet, but we eat too many of them. And if you do eat too many of them, they are linked with obesity and heart disease.” What to eat: plenty of protein Protein is the food group du jour, promising muscle gain to exercise enthusiasts and weight loss to dieters who are drawn to its ability to make people feel fuller for longer (and therefore consume fewer calories). “However, there are lots of major nuances to this,” warns Lawton, noting that in general the under-65s “eat too much protein in the west anyway”. But he says, protein could be beneficial for the over-65s in the battle against sarcopenia, which is muscle wastage. What to eat: a fully balanced plate of food, with someone else “Around this age, we tend to see people’s eating habits change. A appetite tends to decrease, especially when people retire and may be less active,” says Ward. “So if you are not eating as much, you need to be conscious that meals include all your nutrients.” Ward says that it’s not uncommon for older people to lack motivation to cook, especially if they’re on their own or have mobility issues. “I would highly recommend batch cooking when you’re up to it,” she says. “Or to use eating as an opportunity to socialise. Spending time with other people and eating together is great for many aspects of health.” Lots of fruits and vegetablesThere has been a debate over whether five-a-day is trulyenough to meet all our nutritional needs, but given most British adults only eat four portions and children only three, five seems like a worthy goal. Fruit and veg are nimble agents of nutrition, with many straddling essential groups – chickpeas are protein and vegetable, sweet potato is a carb but also and one of your five a day – so eating plenty of them is key. The trick is mixing it up, and giving your body a variety. A popular rule of thumb is to “eat the rainbow”. (However, there’s no evidence that eating a balance of colours leads to a balance in nutritional content.) Omega-3“All children have the potential to be academic,” notes Medlin. “So make sure they’re getting plenty of omega-3, whether that is from oily fish or a supplement.” Research suggests that fish oil could have a role in brain and eye development, and even in school performance, though consistent conclusions are lacking. There’s also been a number of studies that suggest eating fish could reduce inflammation and help with joint pain in our later years – though it’s once again inconclusive. Nonetheless, fish as a choice of protein is solid. The NHS recommends two portions a week. White-fleshed fish is among the leanest proteins and oily fish is high in omega-3 which can also help to keep your heart healthy. CalciumWe know that calcium is crucial for growing children but we also need a good amount from 30 onwards. “After 30, each day that we don’t get enough calcium in our diet, our body leeches it from our bones,” says Medlin. “By the time we get to 60, quite a lot of the calcium from our bones will have gone.” Moreover, Ward says menopausal women should be mindful about calcium intake to prevent osteoporosis. NHS Scotland recommends two to three servings of dairy a day, so one glass of milk, a matchbox size piece of cheese and a yoghurt. For plant-based alternatives, trusty spinach and otherleafy greens can help.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Meal of a lifetime: what to eat at every age,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/14/meal-of-a-lifetime-what-to-eat-at-every-age
5/14/2022,"In the run-up to Cop26, the UK government used the mantra “Cash, coal, cars and trees to keep the world to 1.5C” to highlight four key areas on which the conference would focus. At Cop26, rich countries were supposed to fulfil a longstanding promise, made in 2009, to provide $100bn a year in climate finance to the developing world from 2020. The actual amounts provided are still falling short, but developed countries did produce evidence that they would meet the promise this year or next, with the five-year average from 2020 to 2025 at around $100bn. Developing countries have also been promised a new financial settlement that would see greater flows from 2025, with details yet to be decided. In the months since, however, there has been little advance on the Cop26 promises of cash. Rachel Kyte and Lord Stern, both former top World Bank officials, told the Guardian of several concerns over the World Bank’s programmes on climate. Stern said the bank’s resources would be stretched by the additional strains of high energy and food prices around the world, and the effects of the war in Ukraine. Kyte cast doubt on whether the World Bank was truly committed to the climate fight: “[The World Bank’s] weak showing at Glasgow and continued questions about their appetite for urgent action has meant that coalitions form without them at the helm. Broader questions of whether the Bretton Woods institutions are fit for purpose for the climate crisis grow.” The private sector has also come under closer scrutiny. The GFANZ network – the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero – was announced with fanfare by Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England and UN climate envoy. It is unclear, however, how much of that is flowing to the poorest countries that need it most. There are also questions, raised by the Guardian’s carbon bubble investigation, over whether investors are pouring more money into fossil fuels, now enjoying a bonanza, rather than clean tech. There is little in the GFANZ rules to stop them. Carney said it was the job of governments to regulate and provide incentives that would encourage capital into the right directions: “Finance will not drive the net-zero transition on its own. Finance is an enabler, a catalyst that will speed what governments and companies initiate. If there is commitment to move to a sustainable, resilient and fair energy system, and the right policies are made, finance will be there.” Coal was a clear focus of Cop26, though some of the successes the UK initially trumpeted for commitments to phase out coal turned out to be less solid than claimed. In the closing moments of the talks, coal also became a flashpoint as China and India refused to sign up to a “phase-out” of coal, and insisted on changing the term to “phase-down”. Since then, new evidence has emerged of coal expansion as recovery from Covid has quickened, and the war in Ukraine has spurred some countries to consider a return to coal, or a delay to its phasing out. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), said coal must be at the forefront of Cop27: “The biggest risk is the growing appetite for infrastructure investments in coal. If we are not able to slow that down or stop it, we may lock in our future … If I had to pick one issue [for Cop27], that would be the one.” Electric vehicle sales doubled in key markets last year, as manufacturers ramped up production and consumers embraced new models. But the future of the market this year is looking more uncertain; the war in Ukraine has disrupted key supply chains, and Volkswagen in Germany said earlier this month that it had sold out of electric vehicles for this year for its EU and US markets. Other manufacturers are also struggling with rising costs and looking for alternative sources for components. Many green campaigners are also concerned that talking about cars is the wrong focus – they say we should be talking about transport. Investment in public transport, making it cheaper or even free, is one of the quickest ways to bring down demand for oil, according to the IEA. The UK made action on forests a key focus at Cop26, with a gathering of world leaders to discuss forests and land use and a separate two-day programme of events. A deal to halt global deforestation, signed by China, the US and Brazil among other nations, was the first big “win” of the Glasgow fortnight. But in the past months, Brazil’s deforestation rate in the Amazon has soared to devastating record levels, and a report on the Congo – one of the world’s most important remaining rainforests – has cast doubt on the government’s willingness to take the action needed to halt logging and destruction. Meanwhile, another key forestry meeting this year – the Convention on Biological Diversity (meant to be held in Kunming, China, in 2020, but delayed) – is now in limbo due to the Chinese government’s response to the resurgence of Covid-19. Whether or when the conference will take place at all is now unknown. Lord Goldsmith, the UK minister in charge of the Cop26 forestry efforts, has been on a frantic round of diplomacy this year to shore up the forest deal. He said the UK wanted world leaders to meet every year to discuss progress. “The contribution of forestry to the overall global emissions reductions needed is potentially huge. It could contribute about 10%-15% to the global emissions target.”",News/Environment,"‘Cash, coal, cars and trees’: what progress has been made since Cop26?",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/14/cash-coal-cars-and-trees-what-progress-has-been-made-since-cop26
5/14/2022,"From the US men’s and women’s national teams to the boardroom at Meta, from the grassroots of the American game up to Capitol Hill, reaction to the award of the men’s Rugby World Cup 2031 and the women’s event in 2033 was the same. Naya Tapper, a sevens Olympian and 15s Eagles wing, spoke for many: “I think it shows the growth of the sport and how far it’s come – and how far we have to go.” American rugby union is celebrating but hard work lies ahead. “It’s a beautiful thing to know I can attend a huge rugby event like the World Cup in the United States,” said Tapper, who ran track in high school then found rugby at college in North Carolina. “But we need more eyes on the sport, which would lead to more players and a deeper pool depth and being able to get more scholarships, more professional rugby leagues, not just the national team or MLR for the men.” Tapper and Perry Baker, twice world player of the year, are part of Premier Rugby Sevens, a start-up in which men and women play for equal pay and compete for one prize. Looking to the 15-a-side World Cups, its chief executive, Owen Scannell, said PR7s could help grow “the domestic audience as well as the path to the professional tiers, especially in the women’s game”. Baker echoed Tapper, saying the World Cups must be used to help more young Americans find the sport, as he did in Florida with the Daytona Beach Coconuts, but also to provide a clearer path to the top. “Remember the Olympics is going to be here in 2028,” Baker said, pointing to Los Angeles, where sevens will be played. “So the sky’s the limit, really.” American rugby lovers, alas, know limits all too well. From high school to college, from the amateurs to the pros of Major League Rugby, clubs grapple with poor facilities and finance, with harsh winters which split the season in two, and with travel demands which challenge even the most dedicated team. Tapper said the game needed to get into middle schools, to kids aged 11 to 13. Others said elementary schools were the prize. Blaine Scully, a former Eagles wing and captain who played in the UK for Leicester and Cardiff, said US rugby needed “a pathway for all involved. When 2031-33 comes to pass, the 10-year-old American girl who sees the game for the first time, who falls in love with the sport, can join a team [and] become a player, coach, referee or fan for the rest of her life.” Bob Kimmitt has enjoyed a long life in rugby – and in business and government. He played at West Point in the 1960s, the years when the sport took a tenuous hold, and helped establish the Washington Irish club. He also became an undersecretary at the US treasury, an ambassador to Germany and an independent director at Meta, formerly known as Facebook. Predicting increased attention from such big business, Kimmitt said the World Cup award “shows how that rebirth, rejuvenation of rugby over the past 50 years has come to full fruition at the club level, the college level and importantly now at the professional level. And my hope is that [the World Cups have] the same effect on rugby in the United States that hosting the World Cup in 1994 had on US soccer.” Dan Lyle, another former Eagles captain, played No8 in England for Bath and Leicester. He is now a director at AEG, a sports and entertainment giant. He said: “‘Football has no legacy in America’. ‘The US has no history with the sport’. Those were the claims of some Fifa executives and reporters who backed Morocco or Brazil for the 1994 World Cup. [In 1988] it went to the US anyway and the result was a World Cup that drew 3.5 million fans at more than 68,900 per match over 52 games, a record that stands today. We are on the cusp of the ‘1988 moment’ for rugby. “Why will the US rise? Simply, it is … about the sheer desire, backed by the natural resources of diversity, gender equality, respect, athleticism and inclusiveness America has in abundance.” That’s the vision part. The hard work, Lyle said, will demand engagement with “the American sports complex of after-school programmes, scholastic, collegiate and professional leagues, ownership, public/private enterprise and more”, so “moms, dads, parks & rec departments, athletic directors, broadcasters, brand managers and stadium GMs, along with hundreds of thousands of boys and girls, come to know rugby not just in passing but permanently”. Joe Biden, a rugby fan, backed the US bid. The Guardian was not able to speak to the president but it did find supportive voices in Washington. One co-chair of the Congressional Rugby Caucus, the Washington DC House Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton, said: “Rugby has made a difference to the youth of the District of Columbia and across the country in terms of health, self-esteem, teamwork and social skills.” From the other side of the Capitol, the Connecticut senator Chris Murphy said: “I was first introduced to rugby at Williams [College], and although I wasn’t very good, I loved the sport and made lifelong friends.” Murphy and Holmes Norton both said they were excited the World Cups were coming. HR McMaster also welcomed the news. The retired general who was Donald Trump’s second national security adviser is known for his love of the game. Calling rugby “the best contact team sport in the world … more exciting and safer than American football”, McMaster said: “As Americans learn about rugby I also hope that the sport will inform our political and social discourse. “We can compete fiercely and respectfully. We all have our roles and there is no limit to what we can achieve if we work together as a team. And maybe even ESPN will broadcast more rugby instead of darts, cornhole and poker.” Stranger things have happened. Covid did nobody any favours but US national teams have recently struggled more than most, the men shipping 104 points to the All Blacks, the women 89 to England. The women will expect to do better at the World Cup in New Zealand this year but the men have not yet qualified for France ’23. To avoid last-chance play-offs, they must beat Chile this summer. Nick Civetta, an Eagles second-row forward from Scarsdale, New York who has played for Newcastle, Doncaster and Oxford University, said: “Our goal is firmly focused on qualification this summer, which will be no small task.” He also said: “The opportunity for investment into all levels of the sport that could come alongside a World Cup certainly astounds the typical American rugby player, who is habituated to the reality that rugby has never been a ‘monied’ sport.” Major League Rugby, the competition in which Civetta plays for New York, is in its fifth season. Its salaries are not large and it does not have a big presence in mainstream media. Matt McCarthy covers it via his Rugby Wrap Up site and podcast. He said World Rugby’s “huge, game-changing investment in high schools, colleges, clubs, for men and women, sevens and 15s” would also “safeguard the future of Major League Rugby as a fully professional men’s 15s competition. “The establishment of the pro league in Japan in the years before the 2019 World Cup shows what World Rugby knows must happen. Now the World Cups are coming to America, MLR simply cannot be allowed to fail.” George Killebrew would not argue with that. He’s the MLR commissioner, working out of Texas. He said: “If you remember, back [before the 1994 World Cup] it was more of, ‘If we bring the game to the US, a professional league will be born,’ which is what occurred with Major League Soccer. Ours is the exact opposite. If we are able to add a team or two a year over the next nine years, we’ll be a 28-team league in all the major markets in this country and in Canada by the time the game arrives. “If you look at the US as measured by Nielsen, we are in seven of the largest 10 markets and all of our teams run camps and clinics, they have academy programs, they have relationships with colleges in those cities. So I think we’re well poised to be one of the contributors to the rise of rugby in North America.” The New England Free Jacks have the best record in MLR this year. Their chief executive is Alex Magleby, a former Eagles flanker. “Lots of work has been done to get to this stage,” he said, “in silos at times, perhaps. Now we can all get behind this momentum, with a fixed timeline for success.” In Dublin, Alan Gilpin, chief executive of World Rugby, said significant investment was coming. Half-a-billion dollars has been floated before. At the announcement, Victoria Folayan, a US sevens player turned USA Rugby board member, said the women’s game would have equal access to all such funds. In August 2020, USA Rugby exited bankruptcy. McCarthy said: “The big concern is that any and all funding is appropriated with strict purpose and accuracy. We have an abysmal record in doing those things to date in America.” Others had similar concerns. Lara Vivolo, once an Eagles prop, now coach to women’s teams including New York Rugby Club and Greenwich High School, said: “As a PE teacher, I teach roughly 400 students a year. There have to be resources, equipment and trainers who can push into elementary schools and teach PE teachers about the sport.” The former Eagles fly-half Matt Sherman is head coach of Army West Point, the men’s national collegiate champions. He said the World Cups presented “a tremendous opportunity and a tremendous challenge. I think the challenge is to grow rugby appropriately, so it can be presented well, and then really accelerate. But I think if we don’t do the work, building up to the World Cups, it will not make the impact it’s capable of. “If we invest heavily in youth and high-school growth, and we create a proper fanbase that supports a great event, I think we will get more attention from college athletics. administrators seeing the value in the sport and wanting to invest more in it.” Sherman’s Army team is well funded. Others, less so. Carille Guthrie, a former college player, is president of the James G Robertson & Clive Sullivan Rugby Foundation, a nonprofit aiming to increase participation among Black and indigenous Americans and other people of colour. She said: “The rugby community has toted rugby as the fastest growing sport in the US. But for many of us working at the grassroots level, that growth feels lethargic, stymied and one-sided. Finding funding, sponsorship and support for teams outside of the insular rugby community is frustrating, arduous and at times soul-crushing. “It is my hope that the support of the Rugby World Cup reverberates to less visible rugby communities, like inner-city youth teams and rugby at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). “It’s highly likely that the stars of the Eagles’ 2031 and 2033 World Cup teams have never touched a ball before today. I look forward to seeing USA Rugby actively foster youth rugby by funding grassroots efforts, providing accessible camps and trainings and engaging with diverse rugby communities.” Katherine Aversano, women’s coach at Howard University, a HBCU in Washington DC, echoed Guthrie’s concerns. She said: “The lead-up to the RWC ’31 and ’33 will be the biggest test of the US rugby community’s ability to come together and expand the game to people who have traditionally been excluded. If we do this correctly, all of the grassroots efforts … will thrive. “Who we are as American rugby depends on the participation of everyone.”",Sport/Sport,US Rugby World Cups: what will 2031 and 33 mean for the American game?,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/14/us-rugby-world-cup-2031-2033-men-women-eagles-america
5/14/2022,"The government has been urged to set up an emergency fund to help victims of failed funeral companies, after a recent collapse of a firm left 46,000 people facing losses. In March, Safe Hands collapsed into administration, in a blow for customers who had used it to cover their funeral costs. Campaigners have warned that other firms could also fail, leaving customers in “funeral poverty”. FRP, the restructuring firm appointed to handle Safe Hands’ administration, says the company does not have enough money in its coffers to cover its commitments. For the next six months, Dignity, one of the UK’s biggest undertakers, has agreed to provide funerals for Safe Hands customers on a “not-for-profit” basis and will offer plans to surviving customers. However, many are set to lose money as a result of the collapse. The Safe Hands failure comes at a critical time for the funeral-selling industry, which will face tough new rules from 29 July, when it comes under the remit of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Among new protections for consumers is a ban on certain sales tactics, such as cold calling. Customers will also be eligible for the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, so their money is protected if their plan provider fails. To continue operating, funeral sellers must pass strict tests set by the FCA to gain authorisation. It is feared the change will expose weak players in a sector that has been criticised for aggressive sales tactics and poor value. Campaigners have started a petition calling on the government to create a fund for victims of failed companies. They fear more people will find themselves in the same situation as Safe Hands customers and are calling on the government to “protect the victims from funeral poverty”. If the petition gathers 10,000 signatures, the government will have to respond. The FCA website shows the status of each company’s authorisation application. Of the 66 funeral plan firms listed, 12 have had applications refused or withdrawn them, another 15 intend to transfer their plans to another provider, and seven have made no application at all. An FCA spokesperson says people who bought a pre-paid funeral plan from Safe Hands will be “understandably concerned”. “The government changed the law to bring pre-paid funeral plans under our regulation from the end of July 2022. Until then, firms such as Safe Hands are unregulated and we have limited powers,” they say. “We’re currently reviewing firms’ applications to ensure they meet the standards necessary to be regulated and we have put in place rules they must follow from 29 July, including protection for consumers if firms fail.” The collapse of Safe Hands has left a trail of anguish, with a call centre set up by FRP deluged with 15,000 calls from worried plan-holders. Among them are Susan and John Ogilvie, a couple from Essex who spent £8,000 on two funeral plans. Susan says they used their savings to buy the plans so “nobody has the worry”, but they now face losing most of their money. “A few years ago my sister’s husband died and she didn’t have the money,” Susan says. “The funeral director wanted £2,000 upfront and she didn’t have it. We’re not in that position, fortunately, but you never know. I didn’t want anyone to have to go to a funeral director and say: ‘I haven’t got the money for it.’” FRP is still getting to the bottom of what happened to Safe Hands’ cash but its recent update painted a grim picture. The private equity-backed company used two fund managers to invest customers’ money, FRP says, one of which has gone into liquidation. It has about £4m in cash as well as shares in UK-listed firms, which can be sold. However, a significant proportion has gone into high-risk investments, often in offshore jurisdictions. Dignity will ask customers who opt to transfer their plan to make additional contributions. It says it will price these new plans as “cheaply as possible”, with customers potentially able to spread the cost over five years. “What has happened at Safe Hands is disgraceful and highlights why the discipline and safety of regulation is needed and overdue,” says Mike Hilliar, Dignity’s director of funeral planning. “We have been working with the administrators to ensure that families who suffer a bereavement do not go without a funeral; however, this is only a short-term solution. Longer term, we are working on a solution where funeral plan customers are able to choose to transfer to a Dignity funeral plan.” James Daley, the managing director of Fairer Finance, says it would be right for the Treasury to compensate customers left out of pocket as a result of the new regulation in the sector. “It has always been my view that the Treasury is on the hook for this because we knew the act of regulation would crystallise losses for a number of people holding plans at the moment when these rules came in and bad actors exited the market,” Daley says. “Safe Hands was always going to be the biggest company that looked likely to fail but there are still lots of small and medium-sized companies whose status is unclear.” A spokesperson for HM Treasury says bringing pre-paid funeral plans into regulation will protect consumers from bad practice within the sector. They add: “We recently introduced secondary legislation to make it easier for regulated funeral plan providers to take on customers of providers that are exiting the market. This will protect consumers – particularly during the transition to regulation – by ensuring that more funeral plan holders benefit from continued plan coverage.”",Lifestyle/Money,Funeral plans: government urged to set up fund for victims of failed providers,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/14/funeral-plans-providers-safe-hands

5/14/2022,"When weary delegates tumbled out of the emptying halls of the Scottish Event Campus into the chill of a Glasgow night last November, the mood was buoyant, if exhausted. Workers in hi-vis began dismantling stages and pulling down scaffolding, as the departing representatives of nearly 200 countries exchanged weak high-fives and wry grins. After two weeks of gruelling climate talks, there was a broadly successful outcome: the world had agreed, at last, to make concrete plans to limit global heating to 1.5C. True, the deal reached in Glasgow was fragile. Most countries came to the Cop26 climate summit without carbon-cutting plans of the level of stringency scientists said was needed. They left the talks with targets that would imply heating of about 1.9C – a “historic” achievement compared to the 6C of heating we were heading towards a decade ago, but still far off 1.5C, the figure scientists say is the threshold of safety. That left plenty to do in the months to come. Alok Sharma, the UK cabinet minister who presided over Cop26, summed up the agreement soon after as one that was “on life support”. He wrote in the Guardian: “The 1.5C limit lives. We brought it back from the brink. But its pulse remains weak.” But the pace and brutality of the geopolitical changes since mid-November have been to a climate deal on life support like a cluster bomb dropped on a hospital. In just six months, a world slowly recovering from a pandemic has been wracked by war which, in turn, has created chaos in energy markets, sent food prices surging and threatened shortages, raised inflation and the spectre of recession and unrest, and has upended geopolitical relations. Fossil fuel companies are enjoying a bonanza when they were supposed to be dying out. World leaders, who six months ago were pledging net zero carbon emissions, are now licensing new oil and gas drilling. Coal demand has surged and investors are sitting on scores of “carbon bombs” - high-stakes oil, gas and coal projects that, if followed through, would eliminate any hope of a 1.5C world. It would be easy to think of the Glasgow climate deal and the chance of a 1.5C limit as another casualty of Vladimir Putin’s invasion and brutal war. Russia is the world’s biggest exporter of oil and gas, and one of the largest sources of minerals and coal. Putin has shown he is prepared to weaponise that dominance for his own ends, whatever the consequences. But it is not quite that simple, and perhaps not quite that bad. “Things haven’t fallen apart,” says John Kerry, the US special presidential envoy on climate. “This is not easy, but it hasn’t fallen apart. It has met with an unexpected barrier, the war, and it has met with an unfortunate and dangerous resurgence of business as usual by some parties, that threatens the acceleration necessary to get the job done. It’s going to be up to us to push back and continue with the process.” Six months from now, the world will meet again for the next round of climate talks in Egypt, which is yet to set out a clear programme. Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University and a UN climate adviser, says that Cop27 must focus on “implementation, implementation, implementation”. That means ensuring that the promises made in Glasgow are not forgotten about or fought over, but put into practice as swiftly as possible. “Putting off tomorrow that which needs to be done today has come back to bite us,” she says. “Decades of under-investment in infrastructure, of too slow progress on protecting nature, faltering responses to rising inequality, undervaluing energy efficiency. Now we find ourselves scrambling to swing away from fossil fuels, ramp up renewables, respond to famine and food price shocks and with inflation on the rise and growth stalling, and very little of the policy frameworks we need to make the transitions move smoothly at speed. 2021 was about ambition – 2022 is about following through.” But the invasion of Ukraine by Russia has upended expectations for 2022, and nothing is quite as expected. Russia is likely to attend Cop27, whatever the state of the invasion by autumn. Egypt has long been friendly to Russia which, along with Ukraine, supplies most of the country’s grain. Thirty years of climate negotiations have seen and weathered plenty of previous conflicts, and insiders say countries are practised at keeping discussions under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the parent treaty to the Paris agreement, separate from other geopolitical upheavals. Outright hostility at the summit is unlikely. A worse danger is the “indifference” and “love of the status quo” Kerry fears countries are reverting to, under cover of the war. For the countries that want progress, the key will be to keep international focus on the effects of the Ukraine crisis on national security in the developed world, and of the climate crisis in the developing world, such as the record heatwaves in India and Pakistan. Soaring energy prices as a result of the invasion have prompted a rapid reappraisal of energy policies across the world, particularly in Europe. Before the invasion, Germany depended on Russia for about two-thirds of its gas supplies, and the EU for about 40%. The bloc’s attempts to wean itself off these sources are likely to be painful in the short term, but have accelerated a move that needed to be made in the long term to reach the target of net zero emissions by 2050. There are three clear answers to this energy crisis, according to Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, and one of the world’s foremost energy economists: countries must seek to replace Russian fossil fuels in the short term by squeezing more out of their current supplies. Urgent measures, such as turning down thermostats, imposing speed limits on cars and installing home insulation, must be taken to cut down on demand. And renewable energy must be ramped up fast by removing barriers such as planning problems and grid connections. “I believe we have the chance to make this a historic turning point, towards a cleaner and more secure energy system,” said Birol. “This is the first time I have seen such momentum behind change in the energy sector.” This optimistic view depends on countries seizing the opportunities of renewables and ignoring the pleas of big oil, however. Fossil fuel companies have pledged to plough a proportion of their cash into clean energy, but many are just as likely to pour it into fresh extraction. The Guardian has uncovered nearly 200 examples of new fossil fuel projects now under development that, if brought to fruition, would result in a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, or about 18 years of emissions at current levels. That would put paid to any hope of staying within 1.5C. Support for renewable energy, however, may come from a new and unexpected quarter. Soaring energy prices, and the accompanying high food prices, threaten social stability. Energy has become a political and economic weapon wielded by Russia against Europe, and dependence on fossil fuels has been revealed as a vital strategic vulnerability. Vladimir Putin has succeeded where decades of argument from green campaigners failed: he has made generals and national defence chiefs around the world see that the climate crisis is a national security priority. Birol notes: “National security is now a very important driver, and this makes a very powerful combination, with the economic factors, in leading towards clean energy.” Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Republic of the Marshall Islands, who played a key role at Cop26 in bringing together the High Ambition Coalition, agrees, and says developing countries must press home this argument. “I hope that it is now clear that investing in renewable energy is an investment not just in energy but also in resilience and political independence,” she told the Guardian. “The evidence that climate is a national security issue is mounting higher and higher.” Countries must also understand that their vulnerability to energy shocks is inevitable as long as they rely on fossil fuels, even if the current crisis is resolved, says Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who presided over the Paris agreement who is now a founding partner of the thinktank Global Optimism . “Fossil fuel prices will always be affected by geopolitical swings,” she says. “Some would have us think these events are black swans – improbable, hard-to-predict events. But this is not so. The volatility of fossil fuel prices is constant and pernicious.” While Europe appears to be moving towards cleaner energy, the US is facing a continued logjam in Congress. Legislation proposed by Joe Biden, crucial to fulfilling the promises he made in Glasgow on reducing emissions, is stuck because of the refusal of one Democratic Senator, Joe Manchin, to agree. “It’s depressing,” says Emmanuel Guérin, executive director for the international group at the European Climate Foundation. “It is not a rosy picture. I don’t want to pretend [the Ukraine war] is a crisis that can be easily turned into an opportunity.” Nevertheless, the Biden administration is determined to push forward, according to Kerry. “I’m hopeful that in the next weeks maybe Congress can be able to pass some kind of climate legislation, which will be helpful,” he says. “President Biden is committed to moving forward and obviously he has administrative powers and can issue certain executive orders and do certain things.” Meanwhile, this year has already seen record heatwaves in India and Pakistan that have caused widespread misery, disruption, damage to crops and fears for people’s health. These devastating events are happening at 1.2C of global heating and, according to new research from the Met Office and the World Meteorological Organisation, we are likely to see global temperatures top 1.5C above pre-industrial levels within the next five years. That does not spell the end of the 1.5C goal – temperatures could overshoot the limit in some years without settling above it for the long term – but the conclusions are inescapable. The kind of disasters we are seeing in South Asia, the flooding in Australia and South Africa, and the droughts and wildfires in North America will rapidly become the norm, with consequences for humanity that will far outstrip the effects of any war yet experienced. In the final moments of Cop26, Frans Timmermans, vice-president of the EU Commission, brandished a picture of his one-year-old grandson, Kees, warning that by 2050 the boy would be “fighting with other human beings for water and food” if the talks failed. That image, like the heart-rending images of children living through the war in Ukraine, holds the key to comprehending, and acting on, the problem. “In Sharm El-Sheikh, we need to see progress on the commitments made in Glasgow,” Timmermans told the Guardian. “This is about humanity’s very survival, and the future of our children and grandchildren. My grandson Kees is now walking around. We have all the tools we need to make this happen. So let’s use them.”",News/Environment,‘This is about survival’: will Cop27 bring action on Glasgow climate pact?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/14/this-is-about-survival-will-cop27-bring-action-on-glasgow-climate-pact

5/14/2022,"The Southwestern rail service trundling back and forth between Kyiv and Borodianka, a small town 35 miles north of the Ukrainian capital, has played a number of roles in recent years. Before 24 February, when Vladimir Putin launched his war, it was a busy commuter route for those who worked in Kyiv but preferred the price and pace of suburbia, bringing people to and from sleepy satellite towns such as Irpin, Bucha and Vorzel. In early March this year it was spoken of in more ominous terms, as the destruction of the rail bridge over the river between Irpin and Kyiv heralded the terrifying advance of Russian forces. The names of Borodianka, Bucha, Vorzel and Irpin will long be associated in the public memory with mass graves, torture and suffering. This week, however, as the service resumed its route over the hastily rebuilt bridge, completed in just a month, the train has become a symbol of hope, and even national renaissance. The president of the European investment bank, Werner Hoyer, predicted earlier in the week that Ukraine would require a “multitrillion-euro” injection to rebuild its shattered cities, towns and villages. For now, the people of the Kyiv oblast, or region, are making do with hammers, wrenches, brooms and a grim determination to move on. But the resumption of this train service adds a sorely needed ray of hope, even as the war rages on in the east and south of Ukraine. There are only two services up and running as yet: one leaving at 5.20am from Kyiv-Svyatoshin, a small station on the edge of the capital, that goes up and down the line to Borodianka, stopping 11 times, and a second scheduled service at 17.52. In the early hours of Wednesday, Oleksandr Pylypenko, 68, and his wife, Galyna, 64, were standing in the cold and dark on platform 1 with a small bag of tools. They were going to inspect their home in Borodianka, at the end of the line and one of the most devastated of Kyiv’s satellite towns, from where they had fled four days before the war. “I am told the roof is damaged and so we are going to clean it up a bit,” Oleksandr said. Galyna added: “We can’t move back yet but the local authority has promised to rebuild Borodianka by the winter and I hope they can.” Sitting in the first carriage waiting for them as the train pulled into the station were two conductors, Olga Feschenko, 56, and Iryna Lepel, 46. “This is our first time,” said Feschenko. “I have only heard about what happened in these places.” She added: “This route is very important to a lot of people because they can’t get work in their towns. A lot of people don’t have cars, so for those who left this is the way back.” Valentyna Chayka, 66, and her friend Nina Galaka, 60, had mistimed their arrival at the station and were out of breath as they settled into their seats behind the conductors. Chayka started work again this week as a concierge in a block of flats in Kyiv, thanks to the resumed service. She was returning to her home in a village near Borodianka after a night shift. Galaka was also making her first step in moving on – but one that was far harder to bear. The house in which she was born and had lived all her life had been destroyed after she fled in March. She was going to the fire department to get a document to confirm it was uninhabitable – a first step towards hopefully receiving compensation. “That was my life,” she said, unable to control her tears. After 20 minutes, the train pulled in at Irpin, where Zinaida Maksymets, 64, was getting off. A breeder of prize-winning American cocker spaniels, she was one of those who had clambered across the remains of the blown-up road bridge in March to get out of the town – although her experience was different from most. “I had four dogs on a lead and six puppies in two boxes going over that river”, she said. “Some terrible people had said I should leave the dogs but I would never do that.” Outside Irpin’s station, Maksymets walked up Alley of the Fallen, a pedestrianised street with shops, pharmacies and cafes, all damaged, on either side of a promenade of statues and monuments to the Soviet Union’s sacrifices in 1941-1945. Her flat, a five-minute walk from the station, had been hit, although a mere graze compared to the damage elsewhere. According to the mayor of Irpin, nearly three-quarters of the town’s buildings have been damaged by missiles, artillery, machine-gun fire and all manner of explosives during the Russian occupation and battle of Kyiv. The cost of rebuilding is said to be close to £1bn. It will be a long haul, but the roads are now clean, the water and electricity has returned, and early on Wednesday morning Oleksandr Prabdyvyi, 71, was sweeping the remnants of glass outside the Fora supermarket that had hired him for the job. Further into town, Valeriy Vitrak, 58, and Anatoliy Masyuk, 59, were making repairs at Irpin’s central hospital which, despite red crosses daubed on its sides, had been hit by missiles and raked with automatic gun fire. There was also a sign of the revival of enterprise down one leafy residential road. No 38 Pavlenka Street was completely flattened, but a laminated note attached to a tree outside bore a phone number and a message: “We can repair your roof, install your windows, everything can be made new with our materials. We have experience of rebuilding from nothing.” The next stop on the train’s route, six minutes along, is Bucha, perhaps the most infamous of the towns in the Kyiv region. Close to the 120-year-old railway station, Maryna Bazylyuk, 48, was opening up Olga’s hairdresser for the day. “There are 23 hairdressers in Bucha but there are only two open at the moment,” she said. The salon clients’ conversations are not what they were. “There are a lot of tears,” she said. “I have had a lady in who said the Russians killed her husband but she can’t find his body.” There were more men than women coming in, she said. “Women looked after themselves during the occupation but men come in with long hair”, she laughed, before adding: “One man who came said his son was killed. He was inconsolable.” Bazylyuk said the salon, which opened two days ago, was getting busier, roads were being rebuilt and the military detritus was being cleared up. “It will take a long time, but this is our home and we won’t let them ruin it for us, no matter what happened.” Eight minutes further down the track and the train pulls into the village of Vorzel, which fell to the Russians shortly after the invasion began. Opposite the simple, rural station – nothing more than two platforms – a church is being built and Volodtmyr Holub, 37 a deacon, was helping workmen. Construction started last year but had to be put on hold when the war came. During the occupation, missiles had hit the front of it but failed to explode. “A miracle,” said Holub, smiling. But there were no miracles for the three men found in a mass grave at the back of the construction site. Two had been shot in the head and the third appeared to have frozen to death. “But we will finish this church in three months,” he said with pride. The final stop for the train is Borodianka. Here, 1,340 explosive devices have had to be neutralised and nearly two miles of roads cleared of mines. Two of the town’s bridges are barely passable and temporary structures have been built. But the biggest problem is that 90% of the buildings in the centre have been damaged, many beyond repair. Between some football fields, close to the Church of Archangel Michael, 160 temporary homes were being erected, thanks to funding from the Polish government. By the station, Alla Lytvynenko, 56, was in her newly reopened supermarket opposite some burnt-out shops. Most of her shelves were empty. “How was your occupation?” asked one man, before buying a bottle of vodka. Another of her customers was Iryna Kozachenko, 41, who, with her 12-year-old daughter, stayed the entire time in the town, spending 40 days and nights in her cellar. “I didn’t let my daughter wash, she was kept dirty because I was scared she would be raped,” Kozachenko said. She was reopening the Soviet-themed restaurant she manages with some apprehension. “I don’t know how people will react,” she said. “But the best of places is our home.”",News/World news,The 5.20 from Kyiv: restored suburban rail offers hope as clean-up intensifies ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/14/the-520-from-kyiv-restored-suburban-rail-offers-hope-as-clean-up-intensifies
5/14/2022,"Ukrainian forces “appear to have won the battle of Kharkiv”, according to a US defence thinktank, in what appears to be their fastest advance since Russian troops pulled away from Kyiv and the north-east over a month ago. In another apparent setback to Vladimir Putin’s war aims, analysts said on Saturday that Russian units had not attempted to hold their lines against counterattacking Ukrainian troops around the city. Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city and only 31 miles (50km) from the Russian border, has been under enemy bombardment since the war began in February. But the US-based Institute for the Study of War said in its latest assessment of the conflict that the Russians appeared to be dropping back and aimed to replace their own troops with proxy forces or mercenaries. “Ukraine thus appears to have won the battle of Kharkiv,” the institute said. “Ukrainian forces prevented Russian troops from encircling, let alone seizing Kharkiv, and then expelled them from around the city, as they did to Russian forces attempting to seize Kyiv.” Russian units had “generally not attempted to hold ground against counterattacking Ukrainian forces over the past several days, with a few exceptions”. “Reports from western officials and a video from an officer of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) indicate that Moscow is focused on conducting an orderly withdrawal and prioritizing getting Russians back home before allowing proxy forces to enter Russia rather than trying to hold its positions near the city.” Ukraine now controls territory stretching to the Siverskyi Donets river, around 25 miles (40km) to the east of the city. “We are entering a new, long phase of the war,” the Ukrainian defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said in a Facebook post on Friday night, predicting “extremely tough weeks” ahead during which he said Ukraine would largely be alone against an “enraged aggressor”. However, Moscow is still bombarding villages north of Kharkiv. Some six miles north of the city, firefighters doused smouldering wreckage in Dergachi after what local officials said was an overnight Russian missile attack on the House of Culture, used to distribute aid. Volunteers inside were trying to salvage packages of baby diapers and formula. “I can’t call it anything but a terrorist act,” the mayor, Vyacheslav Zadorenko, told Reuters. “They wanted to hit the base where we store provisions and create a humanitarian catastrophe.” Earlier on Friday, British defence intelligence said Russia had lost “significant armoured manoeuvre elements” from a battalion tactical group – usually around 800 strong – in a failed attempt to cross a strategically important river in the Donbas, to the south-east of Kharkiv. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, said Russian forces had been repulsed three times as they tried to cross the Siverskyi Donets River, losing armour and bridging equipment. “We have eliminated Russian speedboats and helicopters, which they used to cover their attempts,” the governor added, while aerial photography showed destroyed pontoon bridges and armour by the riverbanks. Ukraine’s defence ministry tweeted pictures of a smashed pontoon bridge and destroyed armoured vehicles in Bilohorivka on Wednesday, describing them as showing victims of “artillerymen of the 17th tank brigade”. Analysts believe Russian attempts to gain territory in the Donbas are increasingly focused on Severodonetsk, the easternmost town held by Ukrainian forces – and the Russian forces were trying to cross the river in an attempt to cut off the town. However, the Institute of War said the Russians had “made no progress” with an attempted ground offensive from Izium, and that the Kremlin might not have enough troops to complete an encirclement of Severodonetsk. “The Russians may not have enough additional fresh combat power to offset those losses and continue the offensive on a large enough scale to complete the encirclement, although they will likely continue to try to do so,” the institute said. Other key developments in the war were: “Very difficult negotiations” are under way on the next stage of evacuations from Mariupol and the Azovstal steel plant, where the city’s last remaining Ukrainian defenders are holed up, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said in his latest nightly address. “We do not stop trying to save all our people from Mariupol and Azovstal. Currently, very difficult negotiations are under way on the next stage of the evacuation mission – the rescue of the seriously wounded, medics.” Zelenskiy also warned that the war and Russia’s blockade of Ukraine’s ports were “provoking a large-scale food crisis”, adding that “Russian officials are also openly threatening the world that there will be famine in dozens of countries”. Russia will suspend electricity supplies to Finland from 1am on Saturday the supplier, RAO Nordic, said, amid rising tensions over Helsinki’s bid to join Nato. The US president, Joe Biden, expressed his support for the right of Finland and Sweden “to decide their own future, foreign policy and security arrangements” in a call with his Finnish counterpart, Sauli Niinistö, and Sweden’s prime minister, Magdalena Andersson. In their first conversation since the invasion, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, spoke by telephone on Friday with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, seeking an immediate ceasefire and stressing the importance of open lines of communication. Foreign ministers from the G7 group of rich nations backed giving Ukraine more aid and arms, and the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, announced a further €500m ($520m) worth of military support that should be approved next week by EU members. He voiced confidence the bloc will agree an embargo on Russian oil. Ukraine’s foreign minister told the meeting in Germany he hoped EU holdout Hungary would agree to the oil embargo.
