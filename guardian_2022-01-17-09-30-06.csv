1/17/2022,"The former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has said she almost did not run for the position because she feared her history of mental health problems would be exposed. The life peer was diagnosed with clinical depression in her first year at university and said she was concerned that standing for the role of leader in 2011 would result in her medical history coming out.  She told the Desperately Seeking Wisdom podcast, hosted by Craig Oliver, that she wanted to be able to talk about her mental health on her own terms so she could “own the way in which it was presented”. Davidson said: “I considered not throwing my hat in the ring for leader in case my medical history … came out. “I’m trying to remember dates, but I became leader in 2011, so it would be after the press got hold of Gordon Brown’s children’s medical records, which felt like a really egregious breach. “But the idea that the papers had the power to find out and open up people’s medical records – why wouldn’t somebody want to find that out about the new leader of the Tories in Scotland?” Davidson said that when she was diagnosed about 20 years ago, people did not talk about mental health issues as much, saying: “It was very shameful. I didn’t want anyone to know.” During her time in politics, she has worked with the Scottish Association for Mental Health and Davidson said she was pleased that she had had the opportunity to open up about mental health issues. She expressed hope it could help other people to realise it is not career-ending, as she had feared at the time of her diagnosis. “At that time, I was just starting at uni. I had big dreams, everyone does, but the idea that you could go on and have a big job, that you could be in the public eye, you could be in politics at all, and have this big shameful secret ... It didn’t occur to me,” she said. “I thought that that was my ambition over.” Davidson also spoke about her annoyance at being described as a lesbian kickboxer during the 2011 leadership contest while all the other candidates were referred to by their respective jobs. “I’ll tell you why it annoyed me,” she told the podcast. “One, because I’d stopped kickboxing years before, so it wasn’t even true. And two because it was so reductive, and it was reductive to try and make a point.”",News/Politics,Ruth Davidson speaks of fears over disclosure of mental health history,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/17/ruth-davidson-mental-health-depression
1/17/2022,"Oops she did it again. Britney mania has got another millennial teenager obsessed. Still, Jean is a superfan with a difference. With 172 similarities to the popstar, and the ability to understand the coded messages hidden within her songs before anyone else, Jean is convinced she is the only person who can save Britney. Inspired by the New York Times documentary and the #FreeBritney movement, Saving Britney details the life of the celebrity from her early days in the Mickey Mouse Club to the present day by Shereen Roushbaiani who speaks as an American narrator into a plastic yellow toy microphone. Intersected with long monologue sections from Jean (also played by Roushbaiani), listing reasons why her life has been devoted to the singer, it gives an intricate insight into the mind of an engrossed enthusiast. But while the subject matter feels topical, the solo drama fails to keep us engaged.  Roushbaiani plays the ADHD-diagnosed Jean with youthful confidence. Her 90s childhood bedroom has been transformed into a shrine to Britney. Decorated with a homemade collage dedicated to her on the back wall, it is clear that the star has been present for many of her defining life moments. During her sexual awakening with a female classmate, Britney’s famed kiss with Madonna at the MTV Video Music Awards played on the TV. It was Britney who was there for Jean after her mum died. They even share a birthday – despite it being eight years apart. But though Roushbaiani is full of energy, after 70 minutes watching her alone on stage, her performance becomes grating. Written by David Shopland, many of the lines are cringeworthy rather than naturalistic, and while she tries hard to get the audience laughing, most of her self-deprecating jokes fall flat. The crescendo is Jean’s realisation that, even with such an intense love for Britney, she also might be part of the problem that caused her collapse. But with her whole life fixation falling apart so quickly, this conclusion feels hurried. Britney is an idol to so many, but in this case Jean’s worshipping doesn’t quite land. Saving Britney is on tour until 26 March.",Arts/Stage,Saving Britney review – a Spears superfan breaks the ice,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/17/saving-britney-review-a-spears-superfan
1/17/2022,"Vodafone has struck a five-year deal to sponsor Wimbledon and has signed Tim Henman and Laura Robson as brand ambassadors, with the mobile firm also in discussions about a deal with the teen tennis star Emma Radacanu. Vodafone has signed a multimillion pound deal to become the official connectivity partner of the grass court grand slam event, as well as a wide-ranging collaboration with the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club and the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) to promote an increase in the numbers of people playing the game at all levels.  “There is a huge buzz around British tennis and Wimbledon is once again set to be a high point of the summer,” said Max Taylor, consumer director at Vodafone. “We want to build on this momentum long-term by supporting the grassroots to get players of all ages, abilities and backgrounds involved in sport.” The mobile phone company, which successfully gambled on sponsoring last year’s British & Irish Lions tour of South Africa despite the threat posed by the pandemic, has also confirmed publicly for the first time that it is closing in on a deal with Radacanu. The 19-year old announced herself on the world stage at Wimbledon last year, going on to win the US Open in September and become the first British female player to triumph at a grand slam in 44 years. Radacanu is currently one of the hottest marketing properties in global sport with a string of deals, from Nike and Dior to Tiffany and Wilson, and in December announced new partnerships with Evian and British Airways. “I can confirm we are in talks with Emma Radacanu,” Taylor said. “We think she would be a fantastic ambassador and would be great for our partnership and ambitions around grassroots tennis. There is nothing formal to announce, but we are in talks.” Reports have suggested that a deal with Raducanu, who won BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2021, could be worth £3m, but it is understood this figure is wide of the mark. Vodafone will use its first foray into tennis sponsorship to promote the benefits of next-generation 5G technology, showcasing augmented and virtual reality as well as “internet of things” technology during the tournament. “I will say that the 5G connectivity at Wimbledon this year will be fantastic,” said Taylor, who added that the sponsorship would be backed by a major ad campaign this summer. Taylor said a key element of the partnership was to support the LTA’s ambition to get 10% more children into tennis, and 1 million adults to play regularly, by 2025. The Wimbledon deal marks the latest ramping-up of Vodafone’s sponsorship strategy, which includes deals with Wasps rugby club and Formula E, with a number of new sports and entertainment deals understood to be likely this year. Sponsorship was once a major part of Vodafone’s marketing strategy, with deals spanning Formula One, the England cricket team and Manchester United. “It is really about timing,” said Taylor. “Years ago we had challenges with network and customer service, and some of the attention on sponsorship and partnerships fell away. This is a resurgent Vodafone in the UK. With the momentum we have got in the business, sponsorship is [once again] an important part of our marketing mix.”",News/Business,Vodafone nets five-year deal as Wimbledon tournament sponsor,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/17/vodafone-five-year-sponsorship-deal-wimbledon-tennis-tournament
1/17/2022,"The number of households suffering from “fuel stress” – those spending at least 10% of their family budgets on energy bills – is set to treble to 6.3m overnight when the new energy price cap comes in on 1 April, according to a leading research group. Fuel stress will no longer be confined to the poorest households, according to a study by the Resolution Foundation. Low- and middle-income families will also find it hard to cope as they spend a far greater share of their family budget on these essentials than higher earners.  The forecast will add to calls for the government to take action to avert a cost-of-living catastrophe after global energy market prices surged to record levels. The research shows 9% of English households are currently experiencing fuel stress, an indicator of finding energy bills unaffordable and also the definition of fuel poverty in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. That figure is expected to leap to 27% when the energy price cap rises to about £2,000 a year in April, an increase of more than 50%. The energy regulator, Ofgem, will announce the new price cap level on 7 February. Levels of fuel stress are expected to be highest in the north-east and the West Midlands (33% and 32% respectively), among pensioner households (38%), among those living in local authority housing (35%) and those in poorly insulated homes (69% of families in homes with an energy performance certificate F-rating). Jonny Marshall, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Fuel stress levels are particularly high among pensioner households and those in poorly insulated homes – a stark reminder of the need to modernise Britain’s leaky housing stock and curb national dependency on gas for power and heating.” The foundation called on the government to intervene and said the most effective way to support lower-income families was through the benefits system, with a faster-than-planned uprating of benefits in April, when support is due to rise by 3.1%. An alternative would be an additional payment based on the warm homes discount. The thinktank recommended raising the £140 payment by at least £300; widening eligibility to all families in receipt of pension credit or working age benefits (8.5m families in total) and making payments automatic; making them timelier – the extra support should be delivered via an additional bill discount this spring, following the normal winter round; and making them taxpayer funded, rather than through further increases in everyone else’s energy bills. The foundation has calculated that the measure would cost the taxpayer £2.5bn. A vastly improved warm homes discount would cut the number of households living in fuel stress by about five percentage points, equivalent to more than a million families. The thinktank called for government action to cut everyone else’s energy bills too, by temporarily transferring social and environmental levies from bills to general taxation. This would cut average bills by around £245 and would reduce the number of families in fuel stress by more than seven percentage points – or 1.7m families – at a cost of £4.8bn to the taxpayer. In total, energy bills would be reduced by up to £545 a year, at a cost of £7.3bn, and 2.7m fewer families would be living in fuel stress. “While not cheap at £7.3bn, this plan is affordable, and by cutting bills by up to £545 would help prevent the upcoming rise in energy bills turning into a cost of living catastrophe for millions of families,” Marshall said.",Lifestyle/Money,UK households facing ‘fuel stress’ will treble to 6.3m – thinktank,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/17/uk-households-facing-fuel-stress-will-treble-to-63m-thinktank
1/17/2022,"The 10 richest men in the world have seen their global wealth double to $1.5tn (£1.01tn) since the start of the global pandemic following a surge in share and property prices that has widened the gap between rich and poor, according to a report from Oxfam. Urging governments to impose a one-off 99% wealth tax on Covid-19 windfall gains, the charity said World Bank figures showed163 million more people had been driven below the poverty line while the super-rich were benefiting from the stimulus provided by governments around the world to mitigate the impact of the virus.  Oxfam projects that by 2030, 3.3 billion people will be living on less than $5.50 per day. The charity said the incomes of 99% of the world’s population had reduced from March 2020 to October 2021, when Elon Musk, the founder of the electric car company Tesla, and the other nine richest billionaires had been collectively growing wealthier by $1.3bn a day. Musk, according to figures taken from Forbes magazine’s billionaires list, saw his wealth increase 10-fold to $294bn in the first 20 months of the pandemic, catapulting him above Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, to be the world’s richest person. During a period when technology stocks were soaring on Wall Street, Bezos’s net wealth rose 67% to $203bn, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg’s wealth doubled to $118bn, while the wealth of the founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, increased by 31% to $137bn. The charity urged governments to levy taxes on capital and wealth in a report – Inequality Kills – intended to coincide with the now-postponed gathering of the global elite at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Oxfam said a one-off 99% windfall tax on the Covid wealth gains of the 10 richest men could pay for enough jabs to vaccinate the entire world and provide the resources to tackle climate change, provide universal healthcare and social protection, and address gender-based violence in 80 countries. Even after a 99% levy, the top 10 billionaires would be $8bn better off between them than they were before the pandemic, the charity said. Danny Sriskandarajah, the Oxfam GB chief executive said: “The explosion in billionaires’ fortunes at a time when poverty is increasing lays bare the fundamental flaws in our economies. Even during a global crisis our unfair economic systems manage to deliver eye-watering windfalls for the wealthiest but fail to protect the poorest. It is an avoidable tragedy that every day people die because they lack essentials such as food and healthcare. “Today’s generation of leaders can start to right these wrongs by implementing progressive taxes on capital and wealth and deploying that revenue to save lives and invest in our future. They should make sure that Covid-19’s long-term legacy is quality universal healthcare and social protection for all. Governments have an historic opportunity to back bold economic plans based on greater equality that change the deadly course we are on.” Share prices fell sharply in the early weeks of the pandemic but were then boosted by the stimulus provided by central banks and finance ministries around the world. Cuts in interest rates to record low levels and massive increases in the supply of money through the bond-buying process known as quantitative easing sent stock markets soaring, with technology companies such as Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook boosted by an increase in working from home and online shopping during the pandemic. While people on more modest incomes have also seen their assets rise in value during the pandemic, Oxfam said the 10 richest men own six times as much wealth as the bottom 40% (3.1 billion people). It would take the 10 billionaires 414 years to spend their combined wealth at a rate of a million dollars each per day, the charity added. The threat posed by inequality was highlighted last week by David Malpass, the president of the World Bank, when he announced his organisation’s latest forecasts for the global economy. “Developing countries are facing severe long-term problems related to lower vaccination rates, global macro policies and the debt burden,” he said. “There’s a growing canyon between their growth rates and those in advanced economies. This inequality is even more dramatic in per capita and median income terms, with people in the developing world left behind and poverty rates rising. We’re seeing troubling reversals in poverty, nutrition and health”",News/Business,World’s 10 richest men see their wealth double during Covid pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/17/world-10-richest-men-see-their-wealth-double-during-covid-pandemic
