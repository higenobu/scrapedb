1/13/2022,"Sydney festival chair, David Kirk, has described the board’s failure to grasp the potential ramifications of accepting funding from the Australian Israeli embassy, which sparked a mass walk out of artists, as “just a miss”. In an interview with Guardian Australia on Thursday, Kirk issued a public apology, saying he regrets the distress to artists that the controversy over the sponsorship decision had caused.  Kirk admitted that the festival board was unaware of the sponsorship deal until he noticed the Israeli government logo on the festival program in late November. But he rejected the suggestion this amounted to either a failure in communication between management and the board, or a failure to recognise whether a risk assessment was needed. “It was just a miss,” he said. “We followed all of our normal processes. “And the next question becomes… are your normal processes fit for purpose in the current environment? And that’s something that we’re going to look into in the independent review that we have confirmed and absolutely committed to undertaking.” Kirk said a yet-to-be-appointed independent two-member panel would launch the review as soon as the festival concludes later this month. But he would not say whether the festival would cease accepting sponsorships from foreign governments in the future. ‘We don’t want to preempt the review,” he said. “We just need to make sure it’s independent. The board has already had discussions about the broad nature of it … and we will work with [the independent reviewers] on the terms of reference, and get on with it as soon as the festival is over.” But neither he, the festival’s director Olivia Ansell, or anyone else would be resigning over the issue, Kirk said. Kirk also rejected the suggestion that the way to quell dissent among festival participants and the wider community might be to return the $20,000 sponsorship to the Israeli government. “That’s not something we think is appropriate in the circumstances,” he said. “I think if we had understood, had the foresight to realise that this would be the sort of issue that it has become, then we would have had detailed discussions and we would have considered what the best way forward was, but we didn’t. “We are very sorry for the fact that we put artists in a situation where they felt compromised or have been pressurised, and have either been in a position where they’ve felt the need to withdraw their work or continue with their work [and] have been subjected to pretty serious social media pressure to withdraw. “We really regret that. We accept that we caused that and the review that we intend to undertake is focused on ensuring this ever happens again.” The money was to fund a Sydney Dance Company production of Decadence, devised by Tel Aviv choreographer Ohad Naharin, and an invitation-only Q&A session hosted by the Israeli embassy at the Opera House during the 2022 festival. The latter did not go ahead because of concerns over Covid-19. An Israeli embassy spokesperson told the Guardian on Wednesday that Ansell approached the embassy with the sponsorship proposal in early July. A festival spokesperson told the Guardian “management approached the embassy in the second half of last year”.",Arts/Culture,‘Just a miss’: Sydney festival chair apologises after Israeli embassy sponsorship sparks boycott,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/13/just-a-miss-sydney-festival-chair-apologises-after-israeli-embassy-sponsorship-sparks-boycott
1/13/2022,"New Zealand’s decision to resettle a former vice-president of Afghanistan and 13 family members has sparked controversy, with some asking why hundreds of Afghans who helped New Zealand forces or were associated with them remain trapped abroad and in fear for their lives. Sarwar Danish had already escaped to Turkey before recently arriving in New Zealand, according to Stuff, which first reported the news.  Associate immigration minister Phil Twyford said Danish, a member of Afghanistan’s Hazara minority, was resettled partly because of his human rights advocacy. But one Afghan translator who worked with the New Zealand SAS told Stuff the case highlighted the need for the new Zealand government to do more. “It’s very frustrating that someone … with zero connection to New Zealand has been resettled in this country, when people who directly supported the New Zealand SAS have been left behind.” Assadullah Nazari, president of New Zealand’s Hazara Afghan Association, said he supported Danish’s resettlement but noted there were hundreds of Hazara still at risk in Afghanistan who want visas. “To see that they are still there and suffering – that the Taliban are killing them – and that Danish has been brought from a safe place in Turkey? It just doesn’t seem fair.” Nazari said the government should do more to resettle others who remain in grave danger in Afghanistan. Danish declined to comment when approached through an intermediary. New Zealand has granted 1,400 visas to Afghans as part of its response to the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in August. Twelve hundred were to Afghans associated with New Zealand’s presence in Afghanistan, and 200 to Afghans at “extreme risk” from the Taliban. Danish, the second vice-president in the administration of then-president Ashraf Ghani, is part of the latter category. However, of the Afghans granted visas, only 800 have actually arrived in New Zealand, in part because New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) evacuation efforts from Kabul were cut short in late August after a fatal terrorist attack. Following the attack prime minister Jacinda Ardern said, “The future evacuation will look different to what it has to date, and it will be difficult and it may take longer, but we are not giving up on bringing those who need to come home, home.” At the time, one interpreter who had been approved for a resettlement visa accused New Zealand’s government of “total betrayal” for stopping evacuation flights, asking, “What will happen to us?” A Newshub analysis late last year found that of the 547 Afghans granted visas because they or an immediate family member had worked with the NZDF, just 60 had made it to New Zealand. Due to the closure of New Zealand’s border in 2020 due to Covid-19, INZ declined to process a number of visa applications from Afghans – wrongly, according to a later high court ruling. The high court also required INZ to prioritise processing resettlement applications from at-risk Afghans. However Raza Khadim, a former Afghan translator for the NZDF and a spokesperson for the Afghan Veterans Interpreters Association, said the process remained “super slow”. New Zealand’s Foreign Ministry says it will not consider new resettlement applications from Afghans and their families who helped New Zealand forces. Now, some visa enquiries are going unanswered. According to one New Zealand citizen and Hazara who went to Afghanistan prior to the country’s collapse to help his daughter-in-law’s family escape, he has not heard from INZ or the Foreign Ministry after repeated applications and enquiries. They are now moving around the country to avoid the Taliban, who are targeting the family. “I don’t know what I should do. I don’t know how to handle this situation. But I can’t leave them here,” said the man, who the Guardian has chosen not to name for safety reasons. INZ declined to comment on the man’s case for privacy reasons. Asked about Danish’s case, Sue Moroney, chief executive of Community Law, said: “I’m really reluctant to pit people against each other … everyone is in a precarious situation.” She noted however, “What we’re surprised about is that INZ would prioritise other visa applications to process over the ones they’ve been instructed by the high court to fix. [Danish’s resettlement] alarms us from that perspective.”",News/World news,Anger at NZ government as Afghan ex-vice-president resettled while hundreds of others trapped,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/13/anger-at-nz-government-as-afghan-ex-vice-president-resettled-while-hundreds-of-others-trapped
1/13/2022,"A New Zealand man has had a cockroach pulled from his ear three days after first feeling a squirming sensation. Zane Wedding said he initially thought the problem was just water in his ear. The Aucklander had been for a swim at a local pool on Friday morning and fell asleep on his couch that evening. He woke up with a blocked ear – and the feeling there was something wriggling inside.  On Saturday, Wedding had his ear syringed. He was given antibiotics, instructions to blow-dry the side of his head, and a suggestion he return if he still felt movement. “Immediately after, it felt way worse,” said Wedding. He went deaf in one ear and was unable to sleep. The hairdryer didn’t help. He joked: “I’ve been cooking it [with the hairdryer] since Saturday.” Wedding then booked into an ear specialist. On Monday, she peered into his ear. “Literally the second she looked, she said, ‘Oh my god … I think you have an insect in your ear.’” It took a few minutes, a suction device and tweezers to pull the now-dead cockroach from Wedding’s ear. Wedding gave it to the specialist as a memento; she had never extracted an insect before.",News/World news,New Zealand man has cockroach extracted from ear three days after feeling wriggling,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/13/new-zealand-man-has-cockroach-extracted-from-ear-three-days-after-feeling-wriggling
1/13/2022,"Allowing fossil fuel companies to extract gas from beneath the Lake Eyre basin would “blow out of the water” the Queensland government’s emission targets and make it more difficult for Australia to comply with its international obligations, a new report says. Origin Energy was given approval by the state government to begin exploration for gas on leases in the basin in late December.  If allowed to proceed the application could open up the region – home to one of the last major free-flowing desert river systems – to the extraction of fossil fuels across 225,000 hectares of Queensland’s channel country. Though the licences only allow for exploration, the Queensland academic Ian Lowe examined the potential emissions that would be created if the basin were opened up to production and found that it would derail the state government’s plan to lower emissions. His analysis modelled the emissions created over two scenarios: a high-activity scenario where the gas is produced for export and a low-activity scenario where only minimal work takes place. Under the former, Lowe found gas extraction in the area would generate 199m tonnes of CO2-equivalent a year, while in the latter activity would produce 16m tonnes of CO2-equivalent a year. This is because the gas resource has an unusually high concentration of CO2, ranging from 30% to 35%. Because of this, a large amount of CO2 would be released during the process of extracting the gas – even before it was processed, shipped and burned. “I’d not come across anything like that level of CO2 in other gas fields,” Lowe said. “Even if there wasn’t a leakage of methane and even if the gas was burnt somewhere else so that it didn’t count against Australia’s emissions targets, there’d be a significant release associated with getting the gas out of the ground.” Under the high-activity scenario, Lowe said, extraction and export of gas from the basin would soak up a significant portion of Australia’s national carbon budget and “require a 60% reduction just to stay where we are, let alone moving towards zero”. This would make it more difficult for Australia to satisfy its international agreements under the Paris agreement. But even under the low-activity scenario, Lowe found the yearly emissions created required would amount to half the yearly reduction under the state government’s 2030 emissions reduction target. “The conclusion I came to is even a modest extraction of gas, would blow out of the water Queensland’s stated emissions target,” Lowe said. Under its plan to reach net zero by 2050, the government is aiming for a 30% emissions reduction below 2005 levels by 2030. A government spokesperson insisted its emissions targets “are achievable” and said it was working with industry to “investigate ways to reduce fugitive emissions from resource activities, particularly in the Bowen Basin”. “The channel country leases were required to be issued under previous legislation and are for exploration only – they are not for the production of petroleum or gas,” the spokesperson said. “Any on ground exploration activities would require an Environmental Authority from the Department of Environment and Science, and an approval under the Regional Planning Interests Act, subject to stringent assessment criteria.” The state government “expects industry to reduce emissions, including fugitive emissions” and “more consultation will be done” before permission was granted to Origin to develop its field. Origin was contacted for comment. The International Energy Agency suggested in May that limiting global heating to 1.5C, a goal set out in the Paris agreement, meant the exploration and exploitation of new fossil fuel basins had to stop in 2021. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Ellie Smith, a spokesperson for Lock the Gate Alliance Queensland, which commissioned the report, said it showed the responsibility of meeting the 2030 emissions target was being left to other sectors of the economy. This was because “at the moment in Queensland we have no direct regulation of emissions”, Smith said. “It feels like the fossil fuel industry pushing to get as much gas out of the ground in the dying days of the industry. They know, we all know, it’s the end of the fossil fuel industry. “It’s clear they’re just trying to push and push and push on every front, whether it’s just Queensland, Northern Territory, WA, New South Wales – there’s new development everywhere.”",News/Australia news,Fracking in Lake Eyre basin ‘would derail Queensland’s emissions plan’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/13/fracking-in-lake-eyre-basin-would-derail-queenslands-emissions-plan
1/13/2022,"The Novak Djokovic saga proves the need for an urgent review of the immigration minister’s “godlike” visa cancellation powers, migration experts and advocates for refugees and asylum seekers have argued. The visa cancellation working group, Asylum Seeker Resource Centre and Refugee Advice and Casework Service made the call on Thursday, as Djokovic awaits an imminent decision from the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, about whether to re-cancel his visa.  Expectations within government that Hawke will cancel the visa, leading to Djokovic’s deportation before the Australian Open unless he can challenge it successfully in court, were raised by the tennis star’s statement on Wednesday. In it, Djokovic blamed his agent for an “administrative mistake” when declaring he had not travelled in the two weeks before his flight to Australia, and acknowledged an “error of judgment” by not isolating after he tested positive for Covid. Experts and advocates say the saga has drawn attention to Australia’s dysfunctional cancellation framework and mandatory detention regime, including the plight of asylum seekers at the Park hotel in Melbourne, where Djokovic was held before a court win on Monday secured his release. Hawke is considering cancelling Djokovic’s visa using a personal power that does not guarantee the visa-holder natural justice. Since rule changes in 2014, Coalition governments have cancelled more than 10,000 visas under separate provisions regarding character grounds, a frequent sticking point in Australia’s relationship with New Zealand. Sanmati Verma, the deputy chair of the visa cancellation working group, said Djokovic’s case “has thrown light on the longstanding unfair and arbitrary use of the commonwealth’s cancellation and detention powers”. “Most visa holders whose visas are cancelled on arrival are denied time to provide a response and the chance to get advice from a lawyer. “Many are turned around at the border quickly while in immigration clearance with little or no recourse to redress, even if they face serious harm in their home country.“Those not immediately deported are detained. The laws currently in place require people to be mandatorily detained until they are either granted a visa or deported, resulting in many people being detained for years, even indefinitely.” Dr Carolyn Graydon, principal solicitor of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said conditions in detention centres are “deplorable and pose a constant risk to the health and safety of detainees”.Sarah Dale, principal solicitor of the Refugee Advice and Casework Service said an inquiry into minister’s powers could help restore “substantive and procedural rights” to those facing visa cancellation. Although Australia’s harsh border policies tend to have bipartisan support, Labor has been critical of the Morrison government’s handling of the Djokovic saga, with Anthony Albanese describing it as “diabolical” on Thursday. “This was the biggest sporting story in the world for months,” Albanese told Channel Nine’s Today program.

1/13/2022,"Embattled casino group Crown Resorts says it is ready to accept a takeover bid from Blackstone after the US private equity group sweetened its offer by $400m. If the $8.87bn bid goes ahead it will end James Packer’s association as a shareholder with the company, which has been mired in scandal for two years after government inquiries revealed money laundering at its casinos and the criminal links of junket operators who brought in high-rolling gamblers.  Packer stands to pocket about $3.1bn in return for the 37% of Crown held by his private investment company, Consolidated Press Holdings. In a statement to the ASX, Crown said that if Blackstone made a binding offer at the new price of $13.10 a share, and there were no better deals on the table, it was the board’s “current unanimous intention to recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the proposal”. Packer is under pressure to sell his stake in the company after a Victorian royal commission into Crown in October said he should be required to reduce it to less than 5% by September 2024. The inquiry found Packer’s investment company had “abused its position as a dominant shareholder, which included retaining significant control over the affairs of the company, even after he resigned as chairman in 2018”. In his report, tabled in state parliament, commissioner Ray Finkelstein said there were “a litany of failings” in the way Crown dealt with anti-money laundering rules and that it had “facilitated money laundering” through a bank account held by a subsidiary. The former federal court judge recommended a special manager be appointed to oversee the operation of its Melbourne casino for the next two years. Victoria’s royal commission followed an inquiry in NSW that found that Crown had facilitated money laundering at its Melbourne and Perth casinos and that some junket operators were linked to organised crime. The NSW inquiry in turn came after the publication in 2019 of the Crown Unmasked series, which made a series of allegations about the casino company, by Nine Entertainment’s 60 Minutes and its newspapers. A royal commission is also under way in Western Australia and is set to hear final submissions from counsel assisting, the company and others on 1 February and 2 February. Consolidated Press Holdings has been contacted for comment. Blackstone first indicated its interest in Crown in April 2020, when it bought almost 10% of the company from Melco Resorts & Entertainment, a Hong Kong gambling group that was previously a joint venture partner with Crown in casinos in Macau. It made a non-binding offer for the company at $11.85 a share in April last year and since then has progressively made the proposed deal more attractive by dropping conditions and increasing the price it is willing to pay. Any takeover would be subject to regulatory approval in Victoria, NSW and WA. Crown shares were trading about 8.1% higher at $12.58 early on Thursday after closing at $11.63 on Wednesday.",News/Australia news,Crown Resorts board ready to accept takeover offer after Blackstone sweetens bid,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/13/crown-resorts-board-ready-to-accept-takeover-offer-after-blackstone-sweetens-bid
