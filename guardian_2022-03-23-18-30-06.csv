3/23/2022,"Manchester United have held talks with Erik ten Hag as they continue their search for a manager. The Ajax head coach is one of several candidates on the shortlist to take over from Ralf Rangnick in the summer. Ten Hag asked about United’s budget and plans for the future during an interview this week. The 52-year-old has improved his English since an interview with Tottenham last summer and feels ready to take on a Premier League challenge after more than four years at Ajax. He has previously been in charge of Utrecht, Bayern Munich II and Go Ahead Eagles in a managerial career that started 10 years ago. Ajax are two points clear of PSV at the top of the Eredivisie as Ten Hag pursues a second league title in a row and a third in four seasons. His team were knocked out of the Champions League in the last 16 by Benfica last week. United will speak to other candidates, including Paris Saint-Germain’s Mauricio Pochettino. The former Tottenham manager is under pressure after four defeats in his past six matches, Ligue 1 losses to Nantes, Nice and Monaco coming either side of a Champions League exit against Real Madrid. Rangnick is in interim charge until the end of the season. The club have gone out of the FA Cup and Champions League on his watch, leaving the focus is on trying to finish in the top four. United are four points behind fourth-placed Arsenal having played one game more.",Sport/Football,Manchester United hold talks with Ajax’s Erik ten Hag in manager search,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/23/manchester-united-hold-talks-erik-ten-hag-ajax-new-manager-search
3/23/2022,"Descendants of people born in the Chagos Islands will have a new route to British nationality, the government has announced. Direct descendants of Chagossians who were born on the islands that now form part of the British Indian Ocean Territory, and who are not already Britishoverseas territory citizens (BOTCs) or British citizens, will be able to apply for both forms of British nationality, the Home Office said. The change comes in a proposed amendment to the nationality and borders bill that the government has accepted. The international court of justice (ICJ) found Britain unlawfully separated the Chagos Islands from Mauritius before granting independence in 1968. The UK is defying United Nations votes and court judgments demanding the return of the islands, stressing that the ICJ ruling was only an “advisory opinion”. The new provision will give descendants of native-born Chagossians the right to apply to register as BOTCs and British citizens, free of charge, within 5 years of commencement, or if under 18 at commencement or born within five years of that date, before the age of 23. The provision gives nationality “otherwise than by descent”, meaning those who qualify to be registered under it would also be able to pass it on to their children born abroad – but no further – after the five-year window had passed. The immigration minister, Kevin Foster, said: “The government has listened to the experiences and concerns of the Chagossian community and carefully considered their unique situation. “We are pleased to be able to offer descendants of native-born Chagos Islanders a new route to British citizenship free of charge. “The new provision will mean Chagossians can register as both British overseas territory citizens and British citizens within five years of the route launching.” Further details are to be announced by the government in due course. The Home Office previously announced a £40m support package to Chagossians over a 10-year period, targeted at five areas: education, health, employment, social care and cultural conservation. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office minister Amanda Milling said: “This amendment is a hugely positive development for the Chagossian community in the UK, Mauritius and Seychelles, on which the FCDO has been fully engaged and supportive. “By opening the door to full British citizenship, we are addressing a central concern of Chagossians around citizenship and national identity. The UK will continue to work to address other needs through our Chagossian support package.”",News/World news,Chagos Islands descendants can apply to become British nationals,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/chagos-islands-descendants-can-apply-to-become-british-nationals
3/23/2022,"If nothing else, Vladimir Putin’s packed stadium rally in Moscow last week revealed there is no shortage of Russian people who believe the Kremlin’s grotesquely doctored version of the “special operation” in Ukraine. But it’s not just a matter of state propaganda in Russia: a wider battle for informational truth is under way, exemplified last week by a deepfake video in which Ukraine’s leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy purportedly called on his own soldiers to surrender. “It strikes me that the easiest way to find out if your leader is a big fan of authoritarianism is to follow the trail of lies and disinformation needed to keep them in power,” says San Francisco-based illustrator Brian Stauffer on the thinking behind his artwork for this week’s cover. “Although the truth can be manipulated, access to social media and smartphone cameras makes for fewer shadows to hide in.” That the Zelenskiy deepfake video was rapidly debunked by Ukraine highlighted what appears to be its success in combating Russia’s disinformation weaponry. But, as Dan Milmo and Pjotr Sauer find, the matter of who is winning the infowars is not particularly clearcut. In our special report on the subject, Jon Ungoed-Thomas looks at the Russian disinformation outlets under sanction by the west, while Lorenzo Tondo and Mark Rice-Oxley speak to Ukrainians with family ties in Russia whose relationships have been shattered by a reality gap. We also profile Tucker Carlson, the outraged and outrageous rightwing Fox News host whose conspiratorial takes on the conflict are much enjoyed by the Kremlin. And, in our feature section, the Russian-born American writer Keith Gessen takes an in-depth look at the long lead-up to a war that happened in plain sight, but which few saw coming. War in Ukraine has diverted attention away from the other great crisis of our times, but coronavirus is still very much with us. As the second anniversary of global lockdowns passes, Laura Spinney looks at how the lessons learned may be applied to the next pandemic.

3/23/2022,"It appears the US has entered the age of the jock politician. First ex-Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville wins a US Senate seat in Alabama. Then Heisman trophy winner Herschel Walker kicks off his own Senate run in Georgia. And now former NBA player Royce White jumps into the fray as the Republican challenger to Ilhan Omar in Minnesota’s 5th congressional district. After going public with his candidacy from the steps of Minneapolis’ Federal Reserve, White, 30, published a 3,500-word open letter rallying Black voters away from the leftist “plantation” and their “globalist” agenda while heading off opposition research into his legacy of legal trouble, his personal debts and unpaid child support allegations, and his overall mental fitness. He made sure to address the letter to “Democrats”, dismissing Omar and her ilk as bought and paid for while promoting himself as a populist. In between he invoked God, raged against Big Tech and its overlords and, well, came off more than just a little unfocused. “You motherfuckers don’t own me,” he wrote, hitting back at the tech bros. “You don’t own my mind. I will die for the rights and freedoms that this nation’s constitution affords me before I see myself, my family or my countrymen returned to chains. Your arrogance and petulance insults me to my core.” His political ambitions, while certainly bold, aren’t entirely out of bounds. White is a longtime friend of the conservative movement and Omar, his opponent in the upcoming election, is a progressive Muslim who is a favourite target for the right. White has also appeared as a guest on Steve Bannon’s show and Donald Trump’s former strategist was one of the first prominent Republicans to endorse his run for Congress. But the 6ft 8in White didn’t exactly maintain a low profile even before he started his political career. After being voted Minnesota’s 2009 ‘Mr Basketball’, an honor reserved for the state’s standout high school prospect, White signed on for the University of Minnesota but never played after pleading guilty to shoplifting and assaulting a mall cop. After his second semester he transferred – “reluctantly” he says – to Iowa State, where he proved to be an analytic nerd’s dream: the only player in the country to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks. After posting 23 points, nine rebounds, four assists and three steals in a loss to eventual champion Kentucky in the 2012 NCAA tournament, White declared for the draft and was selected 16th by Houston. Whatever concerns NBA teams had about White keeping his head down were confirmed when he made his appearance in training camp contingent on the league adopting some form of mental health policy and the Rockets making allowances for travel. At Iowa State, he had relied on Xanax and Benadryl to cope when the team flew to games and had hoped to manage the NBA’s far more intense flight schedule by taking the bus when possible. And despite the Rockets accommodating him, White remained at odds with Houston and was eventually traded to Philadelphia in 2013. When he no-showed on the Sixers, they cut him after three months. The following season White resurfaced with the Sacramento Kings on a pair of 10-day contracts. His NBA debut – a home game against San Antonio – lasted 56 seconds and saw him record no significant statistics. Two games later, after fewer than 10 minutes played all together, he was out of the league once again. But that wasn’t the end of White’s athletic career. He played professionally in Canada, dabbled in MMA and popped up again on the basketball radar when he was picked first in the BIG3’s 2019 draft. When he wasn’t being ejected for tussling with Josh Smith, he was tarrying on court to bring attention to the plight of the Uyghurs and working behind the scenes to help shape the BIG3’s mental health safety net. Before Kevin Love, Naomi Osaka and Simone Biles were being celebrated for prioritizing their mental health, White was being pilloried for the same thing. In the wake of the murder of George Floyd, White emerged as a prominent figure in anti-racism protests. All of this is to say White hardly fits the profile of the jock Republican. Unlike Tuberville he’s not an out-of-touch entitlement seeker. (An advocate for financial fair play, White wrote another open letter encouraging NBA players to start their own bank.) Unlike Walker he not only doesn’t run from his mental health challenges, but can ably articulate them. And as the pandemic has plunged the US into deeper denial about its collective mental health, it wouldn’t hurt to have someone in Congress making more noise about this. Sadly for this country, civil discourse is much too broad for nuanced and practical discussions about anxiety, depression and the overhaul the US health system would need to even moderately address these issues. And so far White doesn’t seem to possess the discipline for that debate. (Did I mention his open letter was 3,500 words?) But that’s not to say he doesn’t have a chance of getting elected. Name recognition goes a long way in Minnesota, an electorate that’s more fawning of celebrity than it definitely cares to admit. This is a state that sent Saturday Night Live alum Al Franken to the Senate and had ex-wrestler Jesse Ventura for a governor. Most likely, if voters hold anything against White, it’s him not logging a meaningful second for the Gophers. His stubborn self-determined streak might have cost White a lucrative NBA career. But those same traits that crushed his hoops dream would well lift him to dizzying heights in an entirely new game.",Sport/Sport,Republican Royce White isn’t the average jock turned politician,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/23/republican-royce-white-isnt-the-average-jock-turned-politician
3/23/2022,"“Sometimes I think the devil’s in the Vatican’s own ranks.” While the true-life horror of Roman Catholic child abuse probably wouldn’t sit easily in a genre film, this bombastic but occasionally surprising Mexican-Venezuelan exorcism flick does engage with ecclesiastical sexual abuse in a more general sense. Right down to its blaspheming finale, The Exorcism of God burns with a subversive desire to rip back the veil on the church’s earthly corruption – but the iconoclasm is somewhat undermined by the daft horror mechanics Venezuelan director Alejandro Hildalgo props it up with. Rookie American priest Peter Williams (Will Beinbrink) ill-advisedly takes it upon himself to give a yellow-eyed demon its marching orders from the body of a nun, Magali (Irán Castillo). But, faced with the succubus tied to a bed, he is temporarily possessed by the entity himself and loses control. Eighteen years later, he has apparently recovered and is revered at a Mexican orphanage. But, the children dying in his care hint at the secret festering beneath this veneration; when he is called to a hellhole penitentiary to examine a disturbed prisoner, he must suddenly confront the past again: “She doesn’t need a doctor. She needs a priest.” (A trailer-ready line, if ever there was one.) Recreating the lamplight poster shot from The Exorcist, Hildalgo doesn’t exactly disguise who he is in thrall to – though his film is to William Friedkin’s classic what hair metal was to Led Zeppelin. He gilds it thick – from a “sexorcist” opening sequence, whose tinge of exploitation flouts most of the underlying point about malfeasance, to Joseph Marcell’s mezcal-swigging super-priest, to the evil, crab-walking Christ in Williams’ nightmares. Trying to improve on the basic priest v demon spiritual showdown by having the film enter quasi-slasher territory, with a prison full of possessed inmates, really is jumping the sacrament, though. The closing section has an undeniable cynical swagger, but this is a big, gaudy, overblown altarpiece of a horror movie.  The Exorcism of God is available on 28 March on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,The Exorcism of God review – a big gaudy altarpiece of demonic horror,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/23/the-exorcism-of-god-review-a-big-gaudy-altarpiece-of-demonic-horror
3/23/2022,"In Mississippi and Massachusetts, two pharmacists working in very different parts of America have seen a sharp drop in demand for Covid-19 vaccines in recent months. Their best guesses for why they’ve seen such slowdowns diverge considerably. Saad Dinno, co-owner and pharmacist at four drugstores in the suburbs of Boston, wagers that most people in his community are up to date on their vaccinations. As he speaks from Acton Pharmacy, in the Massachusetts town of the same name, his bet is a fairly safe one – 95% of the people in this county have had at least one shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Bob Lomenick, the owner of G&M Pharmacy in the northern Mississippi college town of Oxford, where just 60% of people in the county have received a single shot, offers a different explanation. “We still have lots of people, even today, who just refuse to get the vaccine,” said Lomenick. “I don’t get into controversial discussions with them, all the evidence proves they [vaccines] are effective. I got all of mine and my family got all of theirs.” The Boston suburbs where Dinno practices are awash in blue Democratic voters, with few surrounding areas voting for Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election by margins smaller than 50%. Meanwhile, precincts in Oxford split closely between Donald Trump and Biden, but voters in many surrounding districts broke for Trump by a margin of 74% or more, a detailed map of both precincts showed. With US health authorities braced for another potential Covid-19 wave, likely to be fueled by the subvariant of Omicron known as BA.2, the country is still deeply divided over its approach to its pandemic future – even as restrictions have been relaxed across all states. Since scientists recorded the first case of the Sars-CoV-2 virus in the US just over two years ago, politicization has been a hallmark of the American pandemic experience. Despite being worlds apart, the pharmacists both said they had to convince customers to take vaccines, but Lomenick said he encountered far more widespread resistance. Neither Dinno nor Lomenick wanted to talk politics, but the dividing lines are clear, and in Acton and Oxford, they mirror national trends. Republicans are far behind Democrats counterparts in vaccine uptake. As of January, just 63% of Republicans have had at least one shot, compared to 91% of Democrats, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) vaccine tracking poll. “If you look at the patterns of under-vaccination, you can see how they track with the political environment,” said Joshua Sharfstein, vice-dean for public health practice and community engagement at Johns Hopkins University and the previous secretary of the Maryland department of health. The division has often been pitched as one of science against politics, masks against liberty and mandates against freedom. But deeply held political beliefs are only part of the story. The split is fed by America’s polarized news media. Republicans tend to trust Fox News above most other news outlets, and became more alienated from mainstream sources between 2014 and 2020, a Pew Research study found. That meant right- and left-leaning Americans have often received wildly different messages about Covid-19. In turn, Fox News’ opinion-heavy coverage has left its audience with more misconceptions about Covid-19. A separate poll by KFF found people who cite Fox as their most trusted pandemic news source are three times more likely than an NPR listener to hold misconceptions about Covid-19. States also diverged wildly in their handling of Covid-19. What the pandemic divide showed – in “real time”, according to one population health researcher – is the expanding role state governments’ play in their residents’ health, as well as the health effects of deprivation in a country where life expectancy is increasingly determined by where a person lives. There are just a few things on which all parties agree. Primarily, everyone wants the pandemic to be over. In January, similar shares of Republicans, Democrats and independents said they were “frustrated”, “tired” and “angry” in a KFF poll. By February, the majorities of all three parties, notably including the strongest support from Democrats (69%), said they believe the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic is “behind us”. And yet Covid-19 could become one more disease Americans in red states tolerate at disproportionately high rates. Health disparities have plagued a large swath of the country for decades. Around 1980, life expectancy gains in the US began to slow in comparison with other wealthy nations. By the 1990s, life expectancy for people living in a large swath of southern states also started to diverge from western and north-east counterparts. The populations facing the greatest risks from Covid-19 gradually shifted over the last two years, from cities along the eastern seaboard to a large swath of south-eastern states stretching from West Virginia to east Texas, according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Science Covid-19 pandemic vulnerability index. The same vast region is well known to population health researchers has having among the nation’s high rates of chronic diseases, risky health behaviors, lack of healthcare access and poverty. “Although the divergence in state health trajectories might reflect changes in demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, a more likely potential explanation is the growing polarization of public policies across states,” said a recent editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association by Dr Steven Woolf, a population health scientist at Virginia Commonwealth University. States that resisted pandemic control measures, such as Florida and Georgia, experienced excess deaths up to four times during than pandemic higher than north-eastern states, such as New York and Massachusetts, which sought to vigorously control the spread of Covid-19 including through vaccines. Excess deaths are considered the most accurate way to count the true toll of the pandemic, because the figure includes direct and indirect deaths above a normally steady annual average. Florida’s surgeon general recently declared the state would “recommend against” vaccinating healthy children. Experts in infectious disease and vaccine hesitancy described the announcement as “irresponsible”, “inappropriate” and “dangerous”, even as Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, continued to attack pandemic prevention measures as a cornerstone of anti-“woke” rhetoric. And, as rhetoric and policy filters down to everyday people, it has left healthcare workers like Sandy Reding, who works in conservative (and socially vulnerable) Bakersfield, California, in a bind. “Oftentimes, in the more conservative areas … folks don’t take [Covid] as seriously,” said Reding, who is also a member of National Nurses United. Like nearly all healthcare providers, her patients have presented her with, at times, unshakeable misconceptions about Covid-19. “It is very frustrating as a healthcare worker, because you feel very disrespected when you’re going to work every day.” Anecdotal evidence and voting data appear to support Sharfstein’s conclusions, points he made with co-authors in a commentary piece in the Lancet last year. “In this country, people get their news from different sources, and there’s a bubble that has a very erroneous and confused narrative about vaccines,” said Sharfstein. “That has driven a lot of misunderstanding about their value with tragic consequences.” Conservative, anti-vaccine sentiment is “probably the largest” factor driving down vaccination rates right now, he said. In July 2021, right-leaning legislatures attacked the powers of public health authorities with the backing of big money donors. In August, Donald Trump was booed when he recommended vaccines at a rally of supporters. By October 2021, five conservative radio hosts died from Covid-19, often after deriding vaccines. By February 2022, one Republican commentator who promoted vaccines said he had received “death threats”. Sharfstein and his co-authors argued public health outreach efforts needed to do more to “diversify” the people delivering vaccine information (including more conservatives), combat misinformation and engage behavioral scientists on the issue. The solution to bringing the country together on its pandemic future is “reducing the forces driving people apart, and creating opportunities for people to see their similarities and common interests,” said Sharfstein. However, in a country divided by media, politics, geography and inequality, this is a tall order. Researchers who focus on disparities in health, such as Dr Randy Wykoff, dean of East Tennessee State University College of Public health and recent co-editor of the book Appalachian Health, argues political ideology alone does not account for lower vaccination rates. “It’s important, at least as a starting point, to acknowledge they may be related, but may not be causal,” said Wykoff. “The same factors that drive many rural Americans to be Republican voters oriented toward Donald Trump are the same factors that result in health disparities.” Urban areas also suffer from health disparities, especially among Black and Latino communities, a majority of whom tend to vote Democratic. In those cases, many of the same forces detrimental to health are at play – poverty, environmental degradation, lack of access to healthcare and indeed vaccine hesitancy. However, researchers view those patterns as distinct, and closely linked to abuses by the medical system – not state leadership or personal political ideology. About 80% Black Americans have received at least one vaccine dose, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation vaccine tracking poll, roughly in line with the national average. Despite apparent barriers, some political scientists find hope vaccines will have a better chance of reaching people across ideological divides than visible tools to combat the pandemic, such as masks. In 2021, when mask mandates were the focus of pandemic politics, assistant professor of public policy at the University of Chicago Austin Wright analyzed how partisanship affected mask-wearing. He found partisanship accounted for more than one-third of the difference in mask utilization across Democratic and Republican counties. “In data, the first thing you look at – without doing anything fancy to disentangle correlation and causation [is] – ‘Do you see a consistent pattern?’ The answer was yes.” Wright and his co-authors added a huge number of variables to their analysis – race, measures of economic inequality and healthcare access, many of the same metrics studied by Wykoff and Sharfstein. These variables reduced, but did not eliminate, the the effect of partisanship. However, this effect is notably weaker with vaccines, for two key reasons. First, partisanship is strongly correlated to race. Many Black and Latino Americans received vaccines later than white Americans. Second, and perhaps more fundamentally, Wright suspects vaccines are a less potent marker of political identity. “You have quite a few people who end up getting the vaccine who do not wear masks,” said Wright. To truly reach across the divide, Wright suspects the US has bigger fish to fry than simply adjusting who delivers public health messages. “There are bigger structural problems for why there are these gaps,” said Wright, explaining how partisanship is tied up in the same issues of inequality that make it difficult to disentangle whether conservative ideology causes or aggravates low vaccination rates. “Frankly, messaging is not going to bridge those gaps.”",News/US news,A tale of two Covid Americas: can the US unite behind a pandemic strategy? ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/23/us-divided-pandemic-covid-vaccines
3/23/2022,"When Amy Liptrot moved to Berlin, she didn’t expect to spend so much time birdwatching. “I came for people, not birds,” she writes in her new memoir. But she buys a pair of secondhand binoculars and goes out in search of hooded crows, known as “hoodies” back in Scotland, and goshawks, numbers of which have recently increased across the city. For Liptrot, birdwatching is the ultimate antidote to scrolling on her phone, forcing her eyes to refocus and look into the distance. The Instant is the author’s follow-up to her Wainwright prize-winning debut The Outrun (now being made into a feature film with Saoirse Ronan), and ostensibly tells of a year spent living in Germany, though this isn’t a straightforward travelogue. It is a slim, impressionistic, often melancholy work that, along with following her adventures in a new place, grapples with ideas of solitude, romance and a life lived simultaneously online and off. This book is not as substantial as its predecessor, though that is not a criticism. Where The Outrun chronicled her battles with addiction and her recovery on the islands of Orkney where she grew up, this feels like a more experimental project, a document of a liminal year in which her interior and exterior lives are keenly felt and recorded. Liptrot moves to Kreuzberg, an arty district in Berlin where, along with watching birds, we find her doing yoga, loitering in cafes, searching for raccoons and obsessively tracking the lunar cycles. “I’ve run away but I find the moon everywhere I go,” she writes. She makes no bones about her loneliness and her need for physical connection: “Asking for new friendship is hard. Hearts and futures can turn on a single afternoon or an accepted invitation – but more often lead to nothing much themselves.” Liptrot brings the same sharp eye to the urban landscape that she did to the wild environs of Orkney, reporting both on what she sees and the ways it is filtered through her imagination. She recalls how, while getting sober back home, she would take boat trips around the islands and swim in the sea to gaze at the life underwater. Berlin is 600km from the sea, but she nonetheless seeks out water in swimming pools, lakes and saunas. In the vast nightclub Berghain, which was previously an electrical power plant, she finds “the dancefloor is the seabed and I am scuba-diving”. Her writing is contemplative, but comes with pleasing flashes of grit and humour. It’s with mounting mortification that she dissects the rituals of modern dating, observing “the pretence of first dates when you talk about where his first flat in the city was or the mildness of the winter, anything apart from sex or reproduction or love or the bottomless ache that made you sign up to a dating website in the first place and willingly endure the indignity of walking into a bar with a nervous stomach and going to the bathroom and looking in the mirror at your sorry fucking face”. In the spring, Liptrot meets a man and falls in love, and her account of their affair is vivid and heady. When they go camping in the forest, her phone battery runs out and for once she doesn’t care. They make plans to move to Scotland together; babies are even mentioned. But in late summer he breaks things off via email and she is devastated, and becomes umbilically attached to her phone again. The book reveals much about the effects of growing up online: Liptrot delights in “travelling in bed”, referring to her hours spent wandering cities on Google Street View. But she also finds the affair that has left her broken-hearted isn’t easily left behind. Her agony is compounded by her addictive tendencies, which prompt her to search out her former lover in old texts, WhatsApp messages and on his social media accounts. At the heart of The Instant is a yearning for new experiences, and for love and connection, with all the vulnerability that entails. On the face of it, these are unremarkable impulses but, in this intimate memoir, Liptrot’s achievement lies in making them feel remarkable.

3/23/2022,"For years, two tiles showing oak tree leaves stood above the names of two individuals in New York’s 9/11 museum’s “In Memoriam” exhibit whose photos could not be found. The rest of the exhibit features pictures of the 2,977 killed during the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Now, after more than a decade of searching, a photograph of one of those two victims – a cafeteria worker at the World Trade Center – has finally been located and installed. On 15 March, the museum replaced the tile with the leaf on it with a 1966 high school yearbook photo of Albert Ogletree, a 49-year-old who worked as a food handler in the north tower when it collapsed. Grant Llera, a museum staff member who was often posted at the museum’s exhibition gallery became curious about the leaf tiles, which reference the swamp oak trees planted on the memorial plaza after the attacks, just a few blocks away from Ground Zero. The tiles represented the victims whose photographs could not be located: Antonio Dorsey Pratt and, up until recently, Albert Ogletree. “It always bothered me that they didn’t have photos – there was a hole in their stories that needed to be filled,” Llera told the Washington Post. When Llera began his job at the National September 11 Memorial Museum in October 2020, he felt the need to locate the photographs to replace the two tiles. “I spend most of my time doing admissions and answering questions from visitors in the galleries, but I really wanted to take this on,” he said. Llera’s search process began with Ogletree after he found an obituary for his wife. At that point, the information that the museum had on Ogletree was scant – it just knew that he was originally from Michigan and that he was born on Christmas Day in 1951. At one point, Ogletree had been married but had no kids with his wife, Kathleen Ogletree, who died in 2004. Through his wife’s obituary, Llera learned that Ogletree’s stepdaughter, Justine Jones, lived in New York and decided to reach out to her on Facebook. Jones responded last summer and said she did not have any pictures of Ogletree as he was “camera-shy and didn’t like to have his photo taken”. He then continued to search online until he came across a 1971 street address for Ogletree in Romulus, Michigan, a suburb in Detroit. Llera contacted the local high school, where staff members said they did not have yearbooks that dated back to the 1960s. Nevertheless, they said they knew someone who did. The school directed Llera to Kathy Abdo, a former math teacher and current Romulus city councilmember. After sifting through a stack of old yearbooks at her town’s historical museum, she eventually found Albert Ogletree in a grainy black and white picture. Ogletree, then 14 or 15, looked on in a white shirt and a slight smile. He was a freshman at the Romulus high school in 1966. “I felt honored to help look for the photo, and to actually find it was an emotional moment,” Abdo told the Washington Post. Abdo sent the photo to Llera, who forwarded it to Jones for confirmation. “She said his face was the same as she remembered, and she was really happy to have a photo of him,” recalled Llera. Jones remembered her stepfather as a loving man who played an important role in her life and was a skilled electronics repairman. “It is a place no one wishes their loved one to be seen, given the circumstances of why they are there. Nonetheless, it is so rewarding to retire that leaf icon tile with the replacement of this quietly compelling portrait,” said Jan S Ramirez, the museum’s chief curator. Llera is now working on tracking down a photograph of Pratt. “I hope that we can find some answers and replace the last oak leaf,” he said.",News/US news,Albert Ogletree was just a name in the 9/11 museum until a worker stepped in,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/23/albert-ogletree-911-victim-museum-new-york
3/23/2022,"‘Brutally unfunny.” “Lacking in charm and good jokes.” “As interminable as it is revolting.” The reviews have not been kind to The Nan Movie, which stairlifts Catherine Tate’s alter ego to the dizzy heights of the big screen. The film finds Nan – aka Joanie Taylor – road-tripping to Ireland with grandson Jamie (Mathew Horne) to visit her dying long-lost sister. Spliced into this story are flashbacks to the second world war, when Joanie and Nell (Katherine Parkinson) courted, and fell out over, the same GI – which explains, apparently, the embittered geriatric the character has since become. The most interesting thing about the film is probably its production history. Plan A, according to recent reports, was that it focus on the wartime backstory which, as it survives in the released film, is told in a totally different, more dramatic register than the broad comedy of present-day Nan. Somewhere along the line, the road-trip framing device spread across the whole movie. That’s a shame – for viewers, because the two strands (and the two versions of Nan/Joanie) feel very mismatched, and for Tate, whose original concept (if those reports are true) represented a more interesting answer to the question: what to do with Nan next? Nan is, after all, Tate’s breakout character, the only one from her hit noughties sketch show to enjoy a substantial afterlife. There were the TV specials, which saw Nan fight off property developers, join an anger management class and entertain a visit from David Tennant’s Ghost of Christmas Present. There was Nan’s leading role in Tate’s excellent 2016 stage show. But what next? As the trajectory of, say, David Brent suggests, audiences are up for coming on a lifelong journey, across different media, with their favourite comic characters – as long as their creators find fruitful new contexts and challenges for those characters to surmount. The supreme example is Alan Partridge, with whom Steve Coogan hits the road next month on a new tour. Having navigated successfully from his origins in a TV news spoof via sitcom, books, stage shows, a podcast and a movie – then back to a TV spoof again – Partridge will probably still be amusing us in his dotage. Key to his across-the-decades success is that very variety of contexts in which Coogan has situated the character. It matters, too, that the persona was so rich, fruitful and true in the first instance. Nan’s a great character, too – if more one-note than Partridge, and overly dependent on the frisson generated by an elderly woman effing and blinding. But the key disadvantage Tate faces in developing the character is that Nan is already old. We as the audience can’t watch her grow (she’s at least 100, going by the film’s improbable chronology). Small wonder that a movie telling her backstory (watching her get younger, in a sense, rather than older) felt like a good next step. You could argue that another of the nation’s best-loved characters, Count Arthur Strong, is in a similar boat. Steve Delaney has been performing Arthur for over 20 years. He never stops being funny, but he doesn’t (can’t?) develop – give or take the slight shifts in emphasis, and degrees of lunacy, in his TV versus his stage incarnations. Both performer and audience get a whole new type of comic experience, and the chance to sound new depths of laughter and emotional significance, when we shadow a character across the span of their lives. That’s what Tate tried to tap into with The Nan Movie, and it hasn’t quite worked. That’s what fans will be looking forward to – alongside the jokes of course – when Coogan steps out onstage as Partridge again, his first live appearance in a decade, in a month’s time.",Arts/Stage,Catherine Tate’s The Nan Movie: when sketch characters run out of road,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/23/catherine-tate-the-nan-movie
3/23/2022,"A whistleblower who spent years working on the integrity of the Australian government’s carbon credit system has launched an extraordinary attack on the scheme, describing it as a fraud that is hurting the environment and has wasted more than $1bn in taxpayer funding. Prof Andrew Macintosh, the former head of the government’s Emissions Reduction Assurance Committee, said the growing carbon market overseen by the government and the Clean Energy Regulator was “largely a sham” as most of the carbon credits approved did not represent real or new cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. His critique – outlined in four new academic papers – has major implications for the credibility of the Coalition’s $4.5bn “direct action” emissions reduction fund, through which the government buys carbon credits from rural landholders and other businesses. It also raises questions for the rapidly growing number of polluting companies promising to buy carbon credits to offset their impact on the planet. The private market in carbon credits was worth $150m last year. Macintosh, an environment law and policy professor at the Australian National University, said all major methods approved by the government to create carbon credits had “serious integrity issues, either in their design or the way they are being administered”. This particularly applied to projects for regrowing native forests in cleared areas. Known as “human-induced regeneration”, it is the most popular method used to create carbon credits. Landholders using the method have signed contracts with the government worth an estimated $1.5bn. Macintosh and his colleagues analysed 119 human-induced regeneration projects in New South Wales and Queensland. They found that despite the government issuing 17.5m carbon credits to these projects – with each credit meant to represent one tonne of carbon dioxide absorbed by growing trees – the total forest area had barely increased. Carbon credits are used by the government and polluting companies as an alternative to cutting carbon dioxide emissions. Instead of reducing their own pollution, they can choose to buy carbon credits that are meant to represent a reduction in emissions elsewhere. Each carbon credit represents one tonne of carbon dioxide that has either been stopped from going in the atmosphere, or sucked out of it. Methods approved to generate carbon credits in Australia include regenerating native forest that has been cleared, protecting a forest that would otherwise have been cleared (known as “avoided deforestation”) and capturing and using emissions that leak from landfill sites to generate electricity. Credits are bought by the government through the $4.5bn taxpayer-funded emissions reduction scheme or by polluters on the private market.  For 59 of the projects, the amount of forest was found to have reduced. They still received 8.2m carbon credits, worth more than $100m. The researchers also found problems with projects at landfill sites that are awarded credits for capturing methane – a potent greenhouse gas released from waste – and using it to run on-site electricity generators. Macintosh said nearly two-thirds of the claimed cuts in emissions would have happened anyway because the power projects were economically viable without carbon credit revenue. It meant the carbon credits generated did not represent “additional” cuts in emissions, as required under law. “What is occurring is a fraud on the environment, a fraud on taxpayers and a fraud on unwitting consumers,” he said. “People are getting credits for not clearing forests that were never going to be cleared, they are getting credits for growing trees that are already there, they are getting credits for growing forests in places that will never sustain permanent forests and they are getting credits for operating electricity generators at large landfills that would have operated anyway.” Macintosh described himself as a “deep believer” in the ability of environmental markets to drive behaviour change and improve environmental outcomes in a cost-effective manner, but said the government needed to take immediate steps for the carbon market to be worthwhile. He called for it to abolish the flawed methods, stop low integrity projects from receiving further credits and set up an independent inquiry into the failures of the system with the power to compel people to give evidence. “The public deserves an explanation for what has occurred and what can be done to ensure this does not happen again,” he said. Macintosh said he believed the initial errors in how carbon credits were issued were unintentional, but subsequently attempts had been made to cover up those mistakes. More recently, as demand for credits increased with fossil fuel companies under pressure to show they were addressing the climate crisis, he believed the government had made a conscious decision to prioritise building an abundant supply of cheap offsets over ensuring their integrity. Macintosh said the failures in the carbon credit system were in part due to a single agency, the Clean Energy Regulator, being responsible for almost everything: designing and regulating carbon credit methods, advising and providing the secretariat for the committee that oversees the integrity of the methods, and buying credits on behalf of the government. “It is a case study in poor governance,” he said. The regulator rejected Macintosh’s assertions, saying both it and the committee had undertaken considerable work using independent experts to test claims made by Macintosh and found no evidence to support them. “Analytical material provided previously by Professor Macintosh has been refuted by more sophisticated independent analysis,” a spokesperson said. The regulator said it had “well established and rigorous processes” to address potential conflicts of interest that arose from it developing carbon credits methods and issuing and purchasing credits, and that the emissions reduction fund was a “robust offsets scheme with a high degree of integrity”. It said issuing carbon credits was underpinned by “rigorous assessment processes” using geographic information system mapping and other “big data”, and that compliance was assured through audits. On the native forest regeneration method, it said a review had found “a very high” level of compliance. Legislation prevented it from releasing data from the specific forest areas that had been used to estimate the change in carbon storage due to regrowth, but they did not match Macintosh’s analysis, it said. Macintosh said there was nothing in the legislation stopping the regulator from releasing the data aggregated across all project sites, or on a project-by-project basis with identifying information removed. He said a lack of transparency was a major problem with the system. A spokesperson for the emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said as chair of the committee Macintosh had reviewed and signed off on methods that he now claimed lack integrity. “Is [he] now suggesting he provided flawed advice to successive commonwealth cabinet ministers?” The Emissions Reduction Assurance Committee was also contacted for comment. Macintosh said he attempted to address the problems with carbon credits while on the committee but had limited success, and regretted he had not taken a stronger stance on some issues. He said he had continued to try to persuade the regulator and other officials of the need to act before deciding to go public. He served on the committee for more than six years before resigning when he was appointed as one of three royal commissioners who examined Australia’s natural disaster response after the catastrophic bushfires of 2019-20. He continues to work for the agriculture department on a program championed by the agriculture minister, David Littleproud, that rewards farmers who protect biodiversity while reducing emissions. Macintosh’s intervention is the strongest in what has become a growing call for an overhaul of how carbon credits are issued, and of the emissions reduction fund. A report by the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Australia Institute last year said “avoided deforestation” projects – under which landholders are issued with carbon credits for not removing vegetation from their land – were essentially “junk” as in most cases the areas were never going to be cleared. A Guardian Australia investigation in 2018 found doubts about several other methods used to generate credits. Macintosh said the analysis by him and his colleagues had two main implications. “Firstly, $1bn in public money has been wasted. The Clean Energy Regulator was meant to be buying emissions abatement but, by and large, it has bought nothing,” he said. “Secondly, where these low integrity credits are being used to offset emissions from polluters, it is actually increasing emissions … because we get the increase in emissions from the polluters but there is no [genuine] offsetting.” Carbon credits are central to the government’s plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The plan, which has been criticised for a lack of detail or new policies, says up to 20% of the cut in emissions needed will come from carbon offsets. To that end, the government is planning to significantly expand the number of ways under which companies can earn carbon credits. It has approved a new methodology that allows fossil fuel companies to generate credits by using carbon capture and storage. Taylor announced in January that generation of credits would also be allowed through plantation forestry, emissions cuts at industrial sites, and the use of biomethane and “blue carbon” – storing carbon in coastal wetland ecosystems. The minister has taken two other steps in recent weeks to increase the supply and trade of carbon credits. The first was to release credit-generating companies from government contracts under the emissions reduction fund so they can earn more on the private market, which triggered a sharp fall in the carbon price for polluting businesses. The second was to cut the tax rate on the sale of carbon credits for primary producers.",News/Environment,"Australia’s carbon credit scheme ‘largely a sham’, says whistleblower who tried to rein it in",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/23/australias-carbon-credit-scheme-largely-a-sham-says-whistleblower-who-tried-to-rein-it-in
