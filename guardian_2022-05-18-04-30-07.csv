5/18/2022,"Aman in an orange shirt stumbled down a narrow street in the Alfalfa district of Seville. It was just before 11am, but the stench of booze preceded him. His eyes were half-closed and he looked as if he hadn’t slept for a couple of days. Over his shoulders he wore a placard bearing the message, in English and Spanish, that he was willing to pay €500 for a ticket for the Europa League final on Wednesday. He staggered up to a pair of bemused French tourists. “I give you 500,” he said in a Glaswegian slur. “Cash. Dinero.” Seville police are anticipating as many as 100,000 fans from Scotland and 50,000 from Germany for the meeting of Rangers and Eintracht Frankfurt. Given how the city went into meltdown in 2003 – a collapsed phone network, a dearth of taxis, streams of fans trudging back along the road from the Estadio Olimpico – when approximately 100,000 arrived for the Uefa Cup final between Celtic and Porto, that represents a daunting challenge. At least this time the final is being played in the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium, although the benefits of it being in the centre of town are perhaps slightly offset by the fact capacity is about 15,000 smaller than the Olimpico. “Even if 150,000 fans don’t come – if it’s half that number or less – we will have substantial issues,” said Seville’s commissioner for citizen security, Juan Carlos Castro. Underlying his concerns, although he was diplomatic, is the threat of violence. Eintracht Frankfurt ultras have been involved in a number of incidents in their European adventure this season, and the two previous European finals Rangers reached, in Barcelona in 1972 and Manchester in 2008, culminated in widespread disorder. Add in the aggressive reputation of the Andalusian police and the potential for serious trouble is clear. “It’s not about the number,” said the Rangers manager, Giovanni van Bronckhorst. “You can bring 50 people and it could give you chaos.” The flip side of those concerns is that this is a Europa League final that has captured the imagination like few others. This is a reminder of the excitement European finals can provide when the clubs who reach them are not used to such achievements; Rangers and Frankfurt have won one major European trophy apiece, both more than 40 years ago. There is an awareness this could be a once-in-a-lifetime event and that means fans want to be here, even if their chances of getting into the game are slim. “We’re the lucky ones who get to play in the final,” said the Rangers forward Ryan Jack. “There’s 100,000 would like to be in our positions.” Both teams have generated memories that will be passed on through the generations and will sustain their clubs in bleaker times. There was the Frankfurt infiltration of Barcelona, when as many as perhaps 30,000 away fans were inside the Camp Nou to witness their 3-2 win in the quarter-final, while the atmosphere for Rangers’ 3-1 victory over RB Leipzig in the semi-final, as the stands shook with fervour, was one of the greatest in Ibrox’s history. Eintracht Frankfurt Trapp; Tuta, Hinteregger, N’Dicka; Knauff, Sow, Rode, Kostic; Lindstrom, Borré, Kamada. Rangers McGregor; Lundstram, Goldson, Bassey; Tavernier, Jack, Kamara, Barisic; Wright, Aribo, Kent. The legends are accumulating: the Römer, the city hall in Frankfurt, has had to cancel nine weddings in case the venue is required for celebrations; should Frankfurt win, you suspect in a decade or two there’ll be as many couples insisting they had to move their ceremonies as people who claim to have seen the Sex Pistols at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester in 1976. Even in 2022, there is something exotic about this great exodus from northern Europe to southern Spain, where temperatures this week have reached into the high 30s. “It’s different from Glasgow,” Van Bronckhorst said. He brought his squad to Seville a day earlier than Frankfurt and, after taking a walk at kick-off time on Monday, they trained in the late afternoon on Tuesday. Conditions could influence what looks to be the key clash, that between the Rangers right wing-back, James Tavernier, the top scorer in the competition with seven goals, and the relentless Frankfurt left wing-back, Filip Kostic. “He’s a top player,” Tavernier said. “I’ve got to bring best version of myself and try to make him deal with me for the majority of the game.” Beyond the tactics and conditions, what is most significant is that this feels like a huge event, far bigger than anything most players on either side has experienced. “It’s a big game, it comes with pressure,” said Van Bronckhorst. “If you play big games you get so much attention, but we have to make sure we concentrate on our game.” That responsibility extends also to the fans whose enthusiasm helps create that sense of anticipation. “I know we have a lot travelling with us,” Van Bronckhorst said, echoing a number of pleas from club legends. “We have to enjoy the occasion, but make sure we are not causing any problems. Half the people will go home really happy and half will not, but we should respect the whole city and people working hard to accommodate us and not leave anything negative behind.”",Sport/Football,Rangers and Frankfurt raise anticipation for Europa League final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/17/rangers-eintracht-frankfurt-raise-anticipation-europa-league-final
5/18/2022,"At St Jude’s, a small Church of England primary school in south London, the morning breakfast club is exceptionally busy. Over the past six weeks the number of pupils coming in to have porridge, scrambled egg and fruit smoothies before the school day begins has climbed from eight to 22 – nearly a quarter of the Southwark school’s population. Families hit by the cost of living crisis are increasingly desperate, says the acting deputy head, Matt Jones. They need help with their debts; they can’t pay their bills. Staff are making more and more referrals to StepChange, a debt charity, and the school has made discretionary payments to help families unable to afford gas, electricity or nappies. Budgets are tight, says Jones, but the school is determined to protect quality school dinners for its children, come what may. “We are taking a stance,” he said. “For many of our children, the food they get at our school might be the one decent meal they get each day. So we’ve got to make sure it continues.” As inflation sends the cost of ingredients spiralling, suppliers have told schools they are doing everything they can to absorb rising costs, but at some point the increases will have to be passed on. Without additional funding from the government, schools may have to opt for smaller portions or cheaper ingredients. The rapid increase in costs is shocking. One school catering manager in Liverpool said 5kg of long grain rice rose from £6.49 in April to £8.30 in May, 5kg of fresh chicken fillet went up from £19.96 to £28.53, and 1.7kg of tinned tuna in brine rose from £6.99 to £8.07. Some schools are considering putting up the price of school lunches next term for those who pay, but they are reluctant to increase the burden on families already caught in the cost of living crisis. Helen Stout is the headteacher of Meadowfield primary school in Halton Moor, Leeds, where many parents are already struggling to feed their children. The school serves a disadvantaged community where some families have been held back by generations of worklessness. More than 60% of her pupils are eligible for free school meals and the school provides breakfast for all children every day – “bread and spread” to make sure stomachs are not entirely empty at the start of the day. There are, however, worrying signs of hunger, Stout says. “Members of staff say children are gorging on food in the morning.” Meadowfield is still providing food parcels for the most needy families – a legacy of lockdown – with the help of a charity called Rethink Food, which intercepts food that is just past its sell-by date and destined for landfill. “It’s all perfectly fine to be eaten. It comes to us and we bag it up,” Stout said. Staff have also been directing parents to a charity called Zarach for basic items such as bedding, beds and mattresses. The school has already decided – reluctantly – to stop funding milk for its 200 key stage 2 children at the end of next week. “The cost has become astronomical,” Stout said, “but [the decision] sits uneasily with me.” She is horrified at the suggestion that children might be given smaller school lunches made with cheaper ingredients because of rising costs. “For some of my pupils, we know that it’s the only hot meal they are getting a day. I would have hoped school dinners would be sacrosanct. We can’t educate them if they’re hungry.” At Meadowfield, like many schools, there are other telltale signs that families are struggling – in children’s personal hygiene and appearance. Children come in without socks, while others are wearing school uniforms that are old and have been handed down not just once but through a couple of siblings. Dr Paul Gosling, the headteacher at Exeter Road community primary school in Devon, and president of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), said his school was struggling to absorb the impact of rising food costs to protect families. “We have held off increasing the cost of meals to paying families as it will be another pressure on them. At the moment the school is absorbing the increased cost but it is not sustainable.”",News/Education,‘The cost has become astronomical’: UK schools struggle with rising food prices,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/17/uk-schools-struggle-with-rising-food-prices-astronomical
5/18/2022,"Given that it has just announced a bill that could spark a trade war in the middle of a cost of living crisis, it is remarkable how often members of the government say that what they want is for everyone to calm down. The intention to legislate is now formally announced but when the bill will be seen by MPs is intentionally unclear. The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, says it was never meant to be this week. Of course it wasn’t. Now the only commitment is “before the summer”. Was it meant to happen like this? The original plan began with Conor Burns, with his new title of US special envoy on the Northern Ireland protocol, being dispatched to Boston and Washington to bend ears over the UK’s predicament. Burns was tasked with softening up a sceptical White House that the protocol needed to change, armed with the hefty tomes of paperwork required from traders under the new system to demonstrate how bad the situation is. And it might have been a reasonable diplomatic mission if the Times had not spiked his guns with leaked plans for the bill that was announced by Liz Truss on Tuesday. US diplomats and key lawmakers fumed at being blindsided. A day earlier in the US, papers were briefed on how hardline Truss was prepared to be and how her cabinet colleagues – and leadership rivals – Rishi Sunak and Michael Gove had gone soft. It was “leadership feather-fluttering”, one cabinet source said of Truss. The leak of the plans sent shock waves through European capitals, prompting threats to cancel the UK’s trade deal, one of three weapons available to either side in the trade deal. Truss hit back in late-night briefed quotes, saying solutions proposed by the EU would make the situation worse. All of the above might suggest a row has been choreographed – Boris Johnson has been happy to use memories of the Brexit fight as a way to gee up flagging backbench support. But sources close to Johnson seem genuinely miffed and there has been no attempt to disguise the irritation with Truss over how this has been handled. No 10 sources have openly briefed against Truss in lurid detail across the Sunday papers. Even on Monday they were emphasising that Johnson had had firm words with his foreign secretary and told her to cool things down. So now there is some need for damage control – perhaps because Johnson had hoped he could adopt a statesmanlike persona and announce the bill with a “more in sorrow than in anger” tone. For the past few days he has been playing the peacemaker, releasing a 2,200-word essay on Northern Ireland on Monday that was far more thoughtful on issues of nationhood than some of his critics might have expected. But of course it is also probably satisfying for Johnson to see his biggest rivals, Sunak and Truss, a little cowed – though his foreign secretary has ultimately got what she wanted. Most ministers are optimistic there will be progress in talks, as are the Tory MPs who are wary of voting for the bill but believe it will never come to that. Those with even medium-term memories will remember a similar tactic on the internal markets bill and its plans to break international law “in a limited and specific way”. The bill was a transparent negotiating tactic and was dropped as soon as it became expedient to do so. Still, it is hard to argue there is not even more urgency now with Northern Ireland lacking a functioning government. On Monday the DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, stared down the tactic and said the announcement that legislation was coming was “just words”. The big, perhaps unintended consequences of the past week is that it seems to have turbo-charged the DUP into going further on their anti-protocol tactics than before, warning they will not return to Stormont until the law is enacted. If this is all “just words”, no one knows quite how the real action will play out.",News/Politics,Irritation all round at handling of move against Brexit protocol,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/17/brexit-northern-ireland-protocol-truss-johnson-analysis
5/18/2022,"The founder of a violent neo-Nazi group created to inspire a race war in the UK is facing jail after being found guilty of continuing to be a member of the organisation after it was banned. Alex Davies, 27, who was described in court as the “biggest Nazi of the lot”, formed the group National Action (NA) when he was a teenager and acted as its main recruiter. Members of NA armed themselves with machetes, swords, firearms and crossbows as they plotted “white jihad” across the UK. One man associated with the group was jailed for planning to kill an MP and another was in close contact with a man imprisoned for a racist machete attack on an Asian dentist. Other members took part in provocative rallies up and down the country, dressed in black, delivering Nazi-style salutes and carrying flags with slogans such as “Hitler was right”. Davies, from Swansea, south Wales, caused outrage in 2016 when he posed holding an NA flag and giving the Nazi salute in the execution chamber of the Buchenwald concentration camp. NA was banned in December 2016 after posting “congratulatory” tweets after the murder of the MP Jo Cox, becoming the first far-right group to be proscribed in the UK since the second world war. But Winchester crown court heard that Davies set up the “continuity group” NS131 – National Socialist Anti-Capitalist Action – to try to circumvent the ban. Barnaby Jameson QC, prosecuting, told the jury that NS131 used the same Nazi imagery as NA and had the same Nazi ideology. He said: “Who was at the centre of all this? The founder, the galvaniser, the recruiter, one Alex Davies. He was probably the biggest Nazi of the lot. The defendant was an extremist’s extremist.” Davies told the court he was not a violent person – though he was pictured taking part in paramilitary training camps – but admitted his aim was for the repatriation of black, Asian and minority ethnic and Jewish people from the UK, except for those doing “essential” jobs. Asked in court if he was a neo-Nazi, Davies replied: “Sure.” Davies, the son of an engineer and a kitchen worker, founded NA with Benjamin Raymond, a Wiltshire artist and the group’s “roving ambassador” who forged links with extremists across Europe and the US. Others associated with NA include Jack Renshaw, of Skelmersdale, Lancashire, who admitted preparing an act of terrorism by buying a machete to kill the West Lancashire MP Rosie Cooper. Raymond was in close contact with a neo-Nazi called Zack Davies shortly before Davies attacked an Asian dentist in a supermarket in north Wales with a machete. Among those convicted of membership have been Mikko Vehvilainen, a British soldier and Afghanistan veteran, and Ben Hannam, a former Met police probationary officer. Supt Anthony Tagg, the head of the West Midlands’ counter-terrorism unit, which led the investigation, said: “National Action were incredibly dangerous, and the ideology they espoused was an ideology of hatred, which caused division in communities across the country. “They sought to identify individuals in what they considered to be positions of authority; within the British army, within policing. They sought to utilise those positions to further their ideological cause.” Davies is the 19th member of the group to be convicted, and Tagg said he believed it had now been dismantled. At its peak NA is estimated to have had 100 members. It was discovered by chance when security guards at Aston University in Birmingham spotted stickers with hate messages and called local police, who referred it on to counter-terrorism specialists. Judge Mark Dennis QC said Davies would be sentenced on 7 June at the Old Bailey. He said: “The defendant must appreciate it’s inevitable a custodial sentence will follow.”",News/UK news,Neo-Nazi group National Action’s founder faces jail after guilty verdict,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/17/neo-nazi-group-national-action-founder-faces-jail-after-guilty-verdict
5/18/2022,"As the UK’s first male professional footballer to come out as gay in more than 30 years, the Blackpool forward Jake Daniels was bound to make an impact with his announcement on Monday night. But walking along the town’s promenade on Tuesday, opinion among locals was divided. While older fans praised the courage and strength exhibited by the 17-year-old, barely out of school and newly in the public eye, many younger fans asked “so what?” and called on football as a sport to move more swiftly with the times. Daniels is the first prominent player in British men’s football to reveal they are gay since Justin Fashanu of Nottingham Forest in 1990. Fashanu, who was frequently the target of malicious comments and crowd abuse relating to his sexuality, killed himself in 1998. Speaking on Sky Sports, which broke the story, the former Manchester United defender Gary Neville reflected that a similar announcement, even in the late 90s when he was active, would have felt “unthinkable” and described the news as “a great day for English football”. It is a sentiment many people in Blackpool share. Mark Kerbil, a stall owner in Bonny Street market, said his wife, a lifelong fan of the club, was delighted at the news. “It’s terrific. People shouldn’t feel trapped inside a shell and unable to be their true selves.” Kerbil’s feelings were similar to those of Dorothy Dempster, who runs Silcocks ice-cream parlour. “I’m one of 10 kids, and I have a gay brother and a gay sister,” she said. “News like this is good for football and it’s good for all of us because it helps erode prejudice – not just sexual prejudice, but those relating to race, gender and disabilities too.” Paul Robinson, 52, echoed this sentiment. “If it stops people being scared and bullied then it’s a good thing,” he said. Highlighting the generational divide in attitudes to homosexuality, Megan Lucy, 22, had more mixed feelings. As the manager of a gay bar in Leeds, she found the news “positive, but slightly bizarre in this day and age”. She said: “Football is the only sport that hasn’t caught up with the times, and it needs to – quickly. If this is the first step towards it doing that then great.” Her partner, Tom Hall, said while he appreciated it must have “taken a lot” for Daniels to come out, he “couldn’t understand why it even qualifies as news”. He added: “Maybe it’s a generational thing, but I just don’t get what the fuss is about. Who cares about his sexuality if he’s a good footballer?” Football fan Cullen Charnock, 19, said Daniels “should not be looked at as being any different to the rest of us”, and his friend Logan Artingstall summed up the mood among his peers, asking: “Don’t you think this news story is bigger than it should be?” Football has long been considered a sport notorious for homophobic attitudes, with high-profile campaigns such as Football v Homophobia, The Justin Campaign – named after Fashanu – and Kick It Out aiming to eliminate discriminatory abuse at all levels. A Paddy Power survey from 2019 found 69% of fans felt the Football Association should be doing more to prevent homophobia in the UK game, and 55% wanted their team to increase its support for LGBTQ+ rights for players. In his announcement, Daniels referred to the culture of “toxic masculinity” that many still associate with the sport, calling out those who equate openness with “weakness”. He went on to explain how the decision to come out had already improved his performance and mental health. “The day after I told my mum and sister I was gay, I scored four goals against Accrington.” Beyond sport, Elton John congratulated Daniels, writing on Instagram: “A courageous and game-changing statement. At 17, he has hopefully changed the face of football forever. Bravo.” Prince William, who is president of the FA, tweeted: “What Jake has done takes courage and will hopefully help break down barriers that have no place in our society.” Boris Johnson tweeted: “Thank you for your bravery Jake. It would have taken huge courage to come out and you will be an inspiration to many both on and off the pitch.” Blackpool FC said in a statement: “It is vital that we all promote an environment where people feel comfortable to be themselves, and that football leads the way in removing any form of discrimination and prejudice.” For many, Monday’s announcement is a watershed moment. To others, it is barely newsworthy. For some, it may be life-saving.",News/World news,‘It’s good for all of us’: Blackpool hails Jake Daniels for coming out,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/17/good-for-all-of-us-blackpool-hails-jake-daniels-coming-out
5/18/2022,"In 1958, shortly after returning to Britain from studying in Paris, the flautist William Bennett received a phone call: “Get to the Festival Hall as quick as you can. Sir Thomas Beecham is doing Richard Strauss’s Ein Heldenleben and is a player short. The rehearsal has already started.” This was soon followed by another call telling him to present himself in Manchester for an audition with the BBC Northern Symphony Orchestra, now the BBC Philharmonic. Five days later Bennett, who has died aged 86 of motor neurone disease, was a member of that orchestra, and embarking on a career as one of the leading players of his generation. Both through influencing the development and design of the flute and making more than 100 recordings as a soloist, many of them on his own Beep Records label, he sought to give his instrument “the depth, dignity and grandeur of the voice or a string instrument”. In 1960 he went to the Sadler’s Wells Orchestra for a year, and he succeeded James Galway as principal flute of the London Symphony Orchestra (1966-72). Then he went to the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, but was soon fired for playing truant in order to do a world tour with the English Chamber Orchestra. This did not trouble him greatly as he enjoyed the freelancing life, and never became a full-time member of an orchestra again. In addition to the ECO, he freelanced with the London Mozart Players, the Academy of St Martin in the Fields and the Pro Arte Orchestra. There was plenty of chamber music: in the Mabillon Trio with the oboist Philip Jones and pianist Susan Bradshaw, and the Lyric Trio with the cellist Margaret Moncrieff and pianist Margaret Norman. As a recitalist he travelled the world, often with the pianist Clifford Benson. With the harpsichordist George Malcolm, he made the first British recording of the complete Bach flute sonatas, and they joined the violinist Yehudi Menuhin in recording Bach’s Triple Concerto in A minor. With Osian Ellis Bennett recorded the Concerto for Flute and Harp by Mozart and much else. He also appeared with larger chamber groups, among them the Melos Ensemble and Nash Ensemble. Several composers wrote solo works for him, including Winter Music by Richard Rodney Bennett and concertos by Diana Burrell, William Mathias and the Argentinian composer Raimundo Pineda. Composers for his trios included Mathias, Jean-Michel Damase, Peter Racine Fricker and Cyril Scott. To extend the repertoire, Bennett did “tons of pinching” from works for violin, including the entire Beethoven concerto and several Mozart violin concertos and sonatas. He unashamedly included these arrangements in his recitals, and acknowledged how much he had learned from the playing of violinists such as Fritz Kreisler and Adolf Busch. Bennett also did commercial sessions: on one occasion, a group of people he had not met before “shambled in, bringing all sorts of instruments. One had a sack of bells from a junk-shop. None of them could read music. There was an Indian sitar player, so I went home and got my Indian flute to play along with him. A figure with an Afro haircut, red silk waistcoat and yellow silk trousers shouted across ‘Give flutie a mike will yer?’. He said my playing was ‘real groovy’ and we were ‘going for the take’. After it was all over I was told that this was Jimi Hendrix.” Born in London, William was the son of Faith (nee Brooke) and Frank Bennett, both architects and acquired the nickname of Wibb from the acronym of his names. At the age of seven he was sent to Beltane school, a “progressive” establishment that was evacuated to Wiltshire during the second world war. While there, William bought a plastic flageolet from the nearby town of Melksham and, by bedtime, could play Clementine. He eventually acquired a plastic recorder, which he would play along with a wind-up gramophone. This was his first contact with the problems of pitch. When he slowed the gramophone down, to learn the difficult parts, the pitch dropped. This early experience led eventually to his rebuilding and retuning his flutes in later life. Soon after this he heard a recording of a real flute, and realised that this was something far better than the recorder, so when he was 12 his mother bought him a thick, wooden Rudall Carte instrument. By the end of the first day he was playing Bach’s Sheep May Safely Graze, and at the end of six months Bach sonatas and Rimsky-Korsakov’s Flight of the Bumblebee, largely self-taught. At the age of 15 he was accepted for lessons by Geoffrey Gilbert, who loaded his pupils with large quantities of scales and technical exercises, all of which he expected to be played through each day. The following year, 1952, Bennett entered the Guildhall School of Music, London. When the time came for national service in 1954 he joined the Scots Guards band, but still managed to continue his studies with Gilbert. The three years in the band were an invaluable experience. New music appeared daily, often having to be transposed at sight and, under the fearsome conductor Sam Rhodes, no allowances were made. The repertoire was wide, and performing on bandstands without rehearsal was “hell at first, but a fantastic experience in retrospect”, making him an excellent sightreader. In 1957 Bennett went to study with Fernand Caratgé in Paris. He kept a notebook with two columns: on the left side “Caratgé says this”, and on the right “Gilbert says this”. The right side usually won. While there he was deeply inspired by hearing the playing of Fernand Dufrêne, and he had a few lessons with another admirer of Dufrêne, Jean-Pierre Rampal. The latter proved to be a big influence on Bennett’s phrasing: he believed in the necessity of developing a singing tone, and of being lighthearted and happy about playing the flute, an attitude that Bennett shared. Of a later period of study with another French flautist, Marcel Moyse, in Switzerland and France from 1965 onwards, Bennett said that the experience was like “having lessons from God”. Bennett’s interest in pitch and tuning, which continued at school with his making of a flute from an old bicycle pump, led to the construction of several other instruments including a balalaika and a guitar. When he acquired a Morley flute, he began carving at the holes and moving the tone holes in order to get it to play in tune. He then rebuilt an old Rudall Carte flute on to a new silver tube, making it as near to scale of a Powell flute as possible. He showed it to his teacher and, after a few adjustments, Gilbert pronounced it better in tune than a real Powell. This led to cooperation with the makers Elmer Cole and Albert Cooper and the development of the Cooper scale and the Bennett scale. For most of his career, Bennett played a Louis Lot (the same make of instrument as played by his hero Dufrêne), but tuned to his own scale. In 2012 he upgraded the Bennett scale, used for Altus flutes, from Japan, and Stephen Wessel flutes, from Somerset. He ran master-classes and a summer school, and taught in Freiburg, Germany, and from 1986 at the Royal Academy of Music in London. In 1995 he was appointed OBE, and he continued to organise flute events until the coronavirus pandemic intervened. The thread that ran though Bennett’s career was the sheer delight he took in flute-playing. When I asked him once about his most worrying moment, he had to think hard: it turned out to be coming in a bar late at the end of Mendelssohn’s Hebrides Overture. In 1961, he married Rhuna Martin, and they had two daughters. They divorced in 1980, and the following year he married Michie Komiyama. She survives him, along with their son, Timothy, his daughters, Vanora and Sophie, and grandchildren Luke, Joe and Naomi.

5/18/2022,"The chief minister of the Isle of Man has expressed his “deep discomfort” after a tribunal found that the island’s medical director had been forced out of her job and suffered “disgraceful” bullying for whistleblowing over the Manx approach to Covid-19. Alfred Cannan, the chief minister since October last year, accepted that the conclusions of Dr Rosalind Ranson’s employment tribunal had “understandably damaged confidence in government.” Ranson had raised concerns about the Isle of Man’s approach to Covid in the early days of pandemic. She had argued for an early lockdown, along with the UK, to avoid a situation “where we are choosing who should be ventilated” in the island’s only hospital with intensive care beds, the Manx employment and equality tribunal heard. But her boss – Kathryn Magson, then interim chief executive of the Department of Health and Social Care – set out to “silence” her by spreading false rumours she was “burnt-out” in order to stop her appearing at a televised press conference, the tribunal found. She also falsely accused Ranson of “seeking the limelight” and being “hungry for power”, the panel concluded. After taking advice from the island’s doctors and consultants, Ranson prepared evidence to be given to ministers, which warned that delaying lockdown could lead to a “major clinical emergency that could overwhelm our health and social care services”. But Magson had “suppressed or had failed to pass on” this “material” evidence, the tribunal found. Ranson’s advice came at a time when the island had no Covid-19 cases. It was put into effect soon afterwards but by then the first Covid case had been identified on the island and several deaths, including in a care home, followed. Despite its slow response, the Manx government was later criticised for its “authoritarian” approach after residents who breached lockdown rules were locked up in allegedly “inhuman” conditions without showers or exercise. Ranson acted as a whistleblower on a number of occasions to raise her legitimate concerns, the tribunal found, saying her interventions were “an irritation growing into a festering sore for Miss Magson”. By January 2021 she had been sidelined to such an extent that her PA and office had been taken away from her, and she had been re-housed in a junior manager’s office with a broken chair, no computer screen and no telephone. This was a “pattern of disgraceful behaviour”, the tribunal found. Ranson took up the £200,000-a-year job in January 2020 with the understanding that she would transfer to become medical director of Manx Care, the new legal entity that took over the island’s health service from April 2021. But she was not transferred after Magson gave her a poor reference and was instead retained as medical director of the island’s health department, in what the tribunal described as a “shell job”. This amounted to unfair dismissal, the panel concluded. The tribunal also criticised various witnesses and official bodies for failing to disclose 244 documents, some of which assisted Ranson’s case, until the tribunal was part-way through. On Tuesday, Cannan gave a statement to the House of Keys, the Manx parliament, to announce “fundamental and wide-ranging reform across the public sector” in response to the case. He said: “This tribunal has raised a number of substantive questions regarding government performance and culture and has understandably damaged confidence in government. I stand today to acknowledge the deep discomfort that we feel with the evidence and findings of this tribunal.” There have been 32,600 infections and 104 coronavirus-related deaths in the Isle of Man since the pandemic began.",News/UK news,"Isle of Man medical director faced ‘disgraceful’ bullying, tribunal finds",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/17/isle-of-man-medical-director-dr-rosalind-ranson-faced-disgraceful-bullying-tribunal-finds
5/18/2022,"Joe Biden has condemned those who spread white supremacist lies “for power, political gain and for profit” during a visit to Buffalo, New York, where 10 people were killed in a racist shooting last Saturday. The US president was close to tears as he recalled the victims’ lives, then became angry as he described forces of hatred that have haunted his administration. “In America, evil will not win, I promise you,” Biden said. “Hate will not prevail and white supremacy will not have the last word.” The mass shooting shook a nation that can sometimes seem numbed to atrocities and marked an alarming convergence of racist extremism, gun violence and the radicalising effects of social media. It also revealed the scale of the challenge facing Biden, who ran for president to restore “the soul of America” after his predecessor Donald Trump’s failure to denounce a deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and took office weeks after an assault on the US Capitol that included white nationalist groups. Authorities say Payton Gendron, 18, opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle on Saturday at the Tops Friendly Market in a predominantly Black neighbourhood of Buffalo. He struck 13 people with gunfire, killing 10, and used a camera to live-stream the rampage. Police have said they are investigating Gendron’s online postings, which included a 180-page manifesto he was believed to have written outlining the “great replacement” theory, which baselessly claims white people are being intentionally overrun by other races through immigration or higher birthrates. The “great replacement” theory has been dragged into the mainstream by some Republican members of Congress as well as Tucker Carlson, the most watched prime-time host on Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News network. In emotional and pointed remarks in Buffalo, Biden did not name names but made clear that such violence takes place in a wider political context. “What happened here is simple and straightforward terrorism,” he said. “Terrorism. Domestic terrorism. Violence inflicted in the service of hate and a vicious thirst for power that defines one group of people being inherently inferior to any other group. Hate. “And through the media and politics the internet has radicalised angry, alienated lost and isolated individuals into falsely believing that they will be replaced – that’s the word, replaced – by the other. By people who don’t look like them and who are therefore, in the perverse ideology that they possess and are being fed, lesser beings. I and all of you reject the lie.” He added to applause: “I call on all Americans to reject the lie and I condemn those who spread the lie for power, political gain, and for profit.” In recent years America has witnessed mass shootings driven by racist hatred in Charleston, El Paso, Pittsburgh, Atlanta and Dallas, Biden noted. “White supremacy is a poison,” Biden said. “It’s a poison – it really is – running through our body politic, and it’s been allowed to fester and grow right in front of our eyes. No more. I mean, no more. We need to say as clearly and forcefully as we can that the ideology of white supremacy has no place in America. None. Look, failure to say that is going to be complicity. Silence is complicity. It’s complicity. We cannot remain silent.” The president also warned: “The American experiment in democracy is in a danger like it hasn’t been in my lifetime. It’s in danger this hour. Hate and fear are being given too much oxygen by those who pretend to love America but who don’t understand America. To confront the ideology of hate requires caring about all people, not making distinctions.” Earlier, Biden and his wife, Jill, laid a bouquet of white flowers at a makeshift memorial of blossoms, candles and messages of condolence set up under a tree outside the Tops supermarket. New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, and Buffalo’s mayor, Byron Brown, greeted the Bidens and the state’s two senators. The president, who publicly grieved the 2015 death of his son, weathered other significant personal losses and is often lauded for his empathy, once again found himself in the role of consoler-in-chief. “It’s not the same but we know a little bit what it’s like to lose a piece of your soul,” he said. After visiting the supermarket, the Bidens went behind closed doors at the Delavan Grider Community Center and met the families of the victims. Ruby Davis, an elderly woman standing behind police lines two blocks from Tops, said: “He’s coming to show love because there’s so much hatred around.” But more than love and support, residents said, they want action. Cherell Toe, 50, said: “If laws don’t change it’s giving permission for this to continue and it sends the message that there’s no consequences for your actions – for taking a life based on your colour or race.” The president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Derrick Johnson, told the Associated Press: “It’s important for him to show up for the families and the community and express his condolences. But we’re more concerned with preventing this from happening in the future.” Yet the trip underlined how far Biden still has to go in stamping out a rise in white supremacist groups or improving gun safety. A record 45,222 people died from gun-related injuries in the US in 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Biden has asked Congress to require new background checks for gun buyers and ban military-style “assault” weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines. But the efforts have been blocked by congressional Republicans. Republicans’ drift to the far right has also come under renewed scrutiny. Liz Cheney, one of the few Republicans in the House of Representatives to break from Trump, tweeted that her own party’s leaders have “enabled white nationalism, white supremacy, and antisemitism. History has taught us that what begins with words ends in far worse.” Barack Obama tweeted: “We need to repudiate in the strongest terms the politicians and media figures who – whether for political gain or to boost ratings – have used their platforms to promote and normalize ‘replacement theory’ and other starkly racist, antisemitic, and nativist conspiracy theories.” On Tuesday the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, sent a letter to Murdoch and other senior Fox News executives urging them “to immediately cease the reckless amplification of the so-called ‘Great Replacement’ theory on your network’s broadcasts”. A White House national security council spokesperson said the Biden administration was implementing a “government-wide national strategy to counter domestic terrorism, which President Biden directed his national security team to develop on his first full day in office, recognizing that has evolved into the most urgent terrorism threat the United States faces today”. A top FBI official told Congress in November that the bureau was conducting about 2,700 investigations related to domestic violent extremism, and the justice department said in January it was creating a new unit to counter domestic terrorism.",News/US news,Joe Biden condemns spreaders of white supremacist lies after Buffalo shooting,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/17/joe-biden-buffalo-shooting-white-supremacist-lies
