12/29/2021,"Patricia Cornwall physically attacked another passenger and invoked the name of a civil rights icon in a dispute over seating and mask-wearing A pre-Christmas flight got dicey when a woman now dubbed ‘Airline Karen’ got into an altercation with another passenger. The ATL Uncensored Twitter account posted a nearly two-minute video of a woman standing with her mask down below her chin while on Flight 2790 from Tampa, Florida on Dec. 23. The woman repeatedly tells an older male passenger who is seated to put his mask on. The incident reportedly started when 51-year-old Patricia Cornwall was trying to get back to her seat but a beverage cart blocked her way. When told to take an open seat until the cart moved enough for her to return, she allegedly said “Who am I, Rosa Parks?” The passenger seated nearby told her “You’re not Black, this isn’t Alabama, and this isn’t a bus.” That lead to the confrontation recorded by one of the plane’s passengers, which was acquired by ATL Uncensored and went viral. WARNING: Profane language, NSFW Delta flight from Tampa to Atlanta got crazy‼️ pic.twitter.com/I9BZUKv3LB — ATL Uncensored | Atlanta News (@ATLUncensored) December 25, 2021 “Sit down, Karen. You’re a god—- Karen, sit down,” the man fires, to the vocal amusement of other passengers. The back-and-forth continues as flight attendants attempt to defuse the situation. When the man calls her a “b—-“, Cornwall strikes him in the face and continues attempting to attack him as an attendant holds her back and the man yells, “That’s assault, now you’re going to jail!” Cornwall then spits on the man and they continue to verbally spar with each other as she’s dragged away by flight attendants and other passengers. A former Playboy model and actress, Cornwall was taken into police and then FBI custody when the flight landed in Atlanta. Per Heavy, she spent Christmas Day in jail and was allowed to fly home to Los Angeles after posting a $20K bond. “This disturbance led to the injury of fellow passengers and Delta employees,” said Atlanta Police. Airlines have had to contend with an multiple incidents involving customers refusing to wear masks or becoming combative while traveling during the COVID-19 pandemic. An American Airlines plane from New York to California was diverted in October when a passenger allegedly assaulted a flight attendant over his refusal to wear a mask, breaking her nose and sending her to the hospital. “The individual involved in this incident will never be allowed to travel with American Airlines in the future, but we will not be satisfied until he has been prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” the airline said in a statement. “This behavior must stop, and aggressive enforcement and prosecution of the law is the best deterrent.” According to the Federal Aviation Administration, there have been 5,779 “unruly passenger” reports and 4,156 mask-related incidents this year as of Dec. 21. The federal mask mandate requires passengers to wear a mask when not eating or drinking. Have you subscribed to theGrio’s podcast “Dear Culture”? Download our newest episodes now!

12/29/2021,"On Sunday, the temperature in Kodiak, Alaska, hit 67 degrees Fahrenheit, setting a December record-high for a state that has become used to them as climate change continues to rewrite history.  The temperature readings in Kodiak did not merely edge out some previous record by a degree or two; the 65 degrees reported at the airport was 20 degrees higher than the previous high temperature record of 45 degrees set on Dec. 26, 1984, the National Weather Service reported.  According to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, Alaska is warming faster than any other U.S. state and twice as quickly as the global average since the middle of the 20th century.  “Alaska’s Changing Environment notes that, since 2014, there have been 5 to 30 times more record-high temperatures set than record lows,” the NOAA said on its website.  A 2019 analysis by the Associated Press found that new global high temperature records were outpacing new low records by a ratio of 2 to 1. That finding was corroborated by the Environmental Protection Agency.  “If the climate were completely stable, one might expect to see highs and lows each accounting for about 50 percent of the records set. Since the 1970s, however, record-setting daily high temperatures have become more common than record lows across the United States,” the EPA said on its website. “The decade from 2000 to 2009 had twice as many record highs as record lows.” Other studies have confirmed that, as global temperatures continue to rise, the ratio will continue to grow in the coming years as humans continue to pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. While many locations in Alaska set record-low temperatures in November, it is the ratio that will help decide where 2021 will ultimately rank in terms of warmer overall temperatures. This is berserk. Kodiak, Alaska hit 65 degrees today, 20 DEGREES warmer than their previous record.Not their average. Their record.That's like winning a 5K by ten minutes. Numerous nearby stations recorded similar.Warmest winter temperature on record. @FOX5DC @MyRadarWX pic.twitter.com/az0meU3LL6 — Matthew Cappucci (@MatthewCappucci) December 28, 2021 Along with December’s heat dome, Alaska has seen another big change during an atypical time of year: heavy rains. Record-breaking downpours of nearly 30 inches were unleashed on the Portage Glacier in late October, the Washington Post reported.  Fairbanks, Alaska, saw its wettest December day in recorded history on Sunday, with 1.93 inches of rain.  Rain in Alaska at this time of year is almost unheard of, but the state isn't the only place where global warming is ushering in changes. In August, rain fell on Greenland's tallest mountain for the first time since records began being kept there in 1950.  “This has never happened before. Something is going on in the atmosphere that's taking us into uncharted territory,” John Walsh, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, told Sierra magazine.  In total, 7 billion tonnes of rain fell on Greenland over the course of three unusually warm August days, which helped speed the melting of its ice sheet. Scientists estimate that because of the rain, Greenland lost 7 times the ice it normally would at that time of year.  Studies suggest that melting sea ice is the reason that the Arctic has been found to be warming at a rate four times faster than the rest of the world.   While numerous high temperature records fell in 2021 across the United States and the globe, including the record for the hottest Christmas in the U.S. on record, Alaska set one-day temperature records in Fairbanks and Anchorage. Those records follow an exceptionally warm summer in 2019.  “Starting on the Fourth of July and lasting multiple days, temperatures across Alaska were 20 to 30 degrees above average in some locations,” the NOAA said on its website. “On July 4, all-time high temperature records were set in Kenai, Palmer, King Salmon, and Anchorage International Airport. The airport reached an astounding, for Alaska, 90°F, breaking the previous all-time record by 5°F!” _____",Science/Yahoo News,67 degrees in Alaska?

12/29/2021,"The judge in Ghislaine Maxwell's trial told jurors to sit every day until a verdict is reached. Judge Alison Nathan said the measures were to avoid a mistrial in case of a COVID-19 outbreak. Jurors are deliberating six child sex-trafficking charges and have been for close to 30 hours. The judge overseeing Ghislaine Maxwell's child sex-trafficking trial told jurors on Tuesday that she wants them to sit every day until a verdict is reached because of rising COVID-19 Omicron cases in New York. ""I must require deliberations every day forward until they reach a verdict,"" US District Judge Alison Nathan told the court, due to the ""highly contagious Omicron variant."" Judge Nathan had also requested that jurors stay until 6 pm every day, but jurors rejected the request and asked to meet only until 5 pm, which the judge accepted. She also reminded the jurors of COVID-19 protocols like wearing N-95 and KN-95 masks and social distancing. She said the measures were to ensure there would not be a mistrial in case of a COVID-19 outbreak. In court, Judge Nathan had previously told jurors they'd have Thursday and Friday off because of New Year's but on Tuesday, she left open the possibility of including weekend deliberations if a verdict was not reached by then. Jurors began deliberating Ghislaine Maxwell's fate on December 21, deciding whether she will be convicted or acquitted of six charges in her child sex-trafficking trial. Prosecutors have accused Maxwell of trafficking girls with Jeffrey Epstein and of sexually abusing them herself. The allegations in the indictment focus on activity between 1997 and 2004, and concern misconduct against four accusers, who were as young as 14 at the time. Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Judge Nathan, handed the charges to jurors on December 21 after closing arguments from prosecutors and defense attorneys. The closing arguments concluded three weeks of testimony, with just two days for the defense — far shorter than the six weeks the attorneys originally anticipated. Here's a rundown of the charges, including what jurors would need to agree on in order to convict or acquit Maxwell on each count. You can read Nathan's complete instructions for jurors here.
