5/21/2022,"By Mark Trevelyan LONDON (Reuters) -In a sign of Russia's urgent need to bolster its war effort in Ukraine, parliament said on Friday it would consider a bill to allow Russians over 40 and foreigners over 30 to sign up for the military. The website of the State Duma, parliament's lower house, said the move would enable the military to utilise the skills of older professionals. ""For the use of high-precision weapons, the operation of weapons and military equipment, highly professional specialists are needed. Experience shows that they become such by the age of 40–45,"" it said. Currently, only Russians aged 18-40 and foreigners aged 18-30 can enter into a first contract with the military. Russia has suffered huge setbacks and heavy losses of men and equipment in the 86-day-old war, in which Ukraine has mobilised practically its entire adult male population. Despite taking full control of the ruins of Mariupol, Moscow remains far from its objective of seizing all of the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. ""Clearly, the Russians are in trouble. This is the latest attempt to address manpower shortages without alarming their own population. But it is growing increasingly difficult for the Kremlin to disguise their failures in Ukraine,"" said retired U.S. General Ben Hodges, a former commander of U.S. Army forces in Europe. Jack Watling, a land warfare specialist at the British security and defence think tank RUSI, said the Russian military was running short of infantry. ""Russia needs to stabilise manning in its military units in Ukraine and generate new units if it is to improve its position on the ground,"" he said. ""This will be a slow and complicated process, but can be accelerated by mobilising people with existing skills and military experience."" The Duma said the proposed legislation would also make it easier to recruit civilian medics, engineers and operations and communications specialists. Separately, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Friday that Russia was forming 12 military units in its western military district in response to rising threats there, citing NATO membership bids by Finland and Sweden.

Nature is made up of some amazing and intriguing creatures. Perhaps one of the most intriguing is the octopus. Some even believe they could be aliens. One mystery that has long evaded scientists is the octopus’s self-destruction after mating. For years, scientists have wondered why octopuses torture themselves after mating.

Get the legendary Chom Chom Roller pet hair remover for $25 Don't Miss: Today’s deals: $150 AirPods 3, rare AirTag deal, $4 smart plugs, $3 sports water bottles, more We’ve long known that mother octopuses torture themselves and sometimes even eat themselves when their eggs are close to hatching. While they aren’t the only creatures in the wild that die after mating, they do have one of the more gruesome approaches to the process. For years, scientists have tried to discover why octopuses act this way after mating. Now, a new study published in the journal Current Biology could provide the answers we’ve all been looking for. Researchers say that mother octopuses torture themselves after mating due to chemical changes that occur around the time the mother lays her eggs. A study in 1977 found that a set of glands near the octopus’s eyes was responsible for the mechanism that caused the self-destruction. The researchers found that these glands produce steroid hormones in the octopus. And, when the mother has laid her eggs, these glands go into overdrive. It is these steroids that are believed to push octopuses to torture themselves. Altogether, the researchers found three separate chemical shifts that occur at the same time the octopus mother lays her eggs. First, there’s a rise in pregnenolone and progesterone. These two hormones are usually associated with reproduction in a host of creatures. So, it isn’t surprising to see them here. Next, they saw a second shift as the octopus began producing higher levels of 7-dehydrocholesterol, or 7-DHC. This is a building block of cholesterol, and humans also produce it in the process of making cholesterol, as well. However, it may be one of the chemical changes causing octopuses to torture themselves after mating. 7-DHC can be a toxic compound. That’s why humans don’t keep it in their systems long. The researchers also noted that the optic glands began producing more of the components used in bile acids. Octopuses don’t utilize the same kind of bile acids as humans and other animals, but they do make the building blocks for those acids. The researchers believe that these chemical changes all come together and cause octopuses to torture themselves. The exact reasoning for why these changes occur, though, or why the octopus’s body is designed this way is still unclear. Z. Yan Wang, an assistant professor at the University of Washington, told Live Science that it could be a way to protect the younger octopuses. Octopuses are naturally cannibalistic creatures. As such, the torture, and subsequent death caused by these changes could be a way of naturally culling the older generation to protect the younglings before they can be killed and eaten by the older octopuses.

5/21/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. has gathered intelligence that shows some Russian officials have become concerned that Russian forces in the ravaged port city of Mariupol are carrying out grievous abuses, a U.S official familiar with the findings said Wednesday. The Russian officials are concerned that the abuses will backfire and further inspire Mariupol residents to resist the Russian occupation. The U.S. official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the Russians, who were not identified, also feared that the abuses will undercut Russia's claim that they’ve liberated the Russian-speaking city. The abuses include beating and electrocuting city officials and robbing homes, according to the intelligence finding. The new intelligence has been declassified and was shared by a U.S. official as some of the last Ukrainian fighters in the devastated city emerged from the ruined Azovstal steelworks. The fighters were ordered by their military to abandon the last stronghold of resistance in the now-flattened port city and face an uncertain fate. Hundreds of the fighters had held out for months under relentless bombardment in the last bastion of resistance in the devastated city. The city has been reduced to rubble and has seen some of the most intense fighting of the war. The seaside city captured worldwide attention after a March 9 Russian airstrike on a maternity hospital, and then after another airstrike a week later on a theater that was serving as the city’s largest bomb shelter. At the theater, the word “CHILDREN” was written in Russian on the pavement outside to deter an attack. Nearly 600 people were killed, inside and outside the theater, by some estimates. It was unclear the extent of the suspected abuse gleaned in the U.S. intelligence finding, but it comes on the heels of widespread human rights abuses in and around Bucha and the suburbs of Kyiv. Evidence of the massacre in Bucha emerged early last month after Russian forces withdrew from the city.( Photographs and video from Bucha showed body bags piled in trenches, lifeless limbs protruding from hastily dug graves, and corpses scattered in streets where they fell. Meanwhile, the first captured Russian soldier to be put on trial by Ukraine on war-crimes charges pleaded guilty on Wednesday to killing a civilian and could face life in prison. Russian Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old member of a tank unit, pleaded guilty to shooting an unarmed 62-year-old Ukrainian man in the head through a car window in the opening days of the war. Ukraine’s top prosecutor has said some 40 more war-crimes cases are being readied.",World/Associated Press,US intel shows Russians fear Mariupol abuse will backfire,https://news.yahoo.com/us-intel-shows-russians-fear-003934545.html
5/21/2022,"LAS VEGAS — It’s the mob guy who went missing after skimming from the Stardust casino. No, it’s the lake resort manager hunted down by the Chicago Outfit. Could it be the work of a biker gang muscling in on Mafia turf? Or maybe someone just fell off a boat after one too many. Ever since the bodies started turning up this month in Lake Mead — the first in a barrel, the next half-buried in sand, both exposed by plunging water levels — theories in Las Vegas are flourishing about who they are, how they wound up in the country’s largest man-made reservoir, and what might surface next. Lynette Melvin found the second body with her sister while paddleboarding. At first, they thought they had stumbled onto bones of a bighorn sheep. “It wasn’t until I saw the jawbone with a silver filling that I was like, ‘Whoa, this is human,’ and started to freak out,” Melvin, 30, said. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times The discovery of human remains is always a source of tragedy and potential pain for loved ones — especially when they show signs of a violent end. But in Las Vegas, a town where the seedy underbelly is part of the draw, macabre fascination and amateur sleuthing have quickly followed. As Melvin put it, “There’s a whole lot of mystery around them.” The somber findings come amid the Southwest’s driest two decades in more than 1,000 years as drought-starved bodies of water yield one surprise after another. At Elephant Butte Reservoir in New Mexico, a bachelor party stumbled across a fossilized mastodon skull that is millions of years old. In Utah last year, the receding waters of Lake Powell revealed a car that had plunged 600 feet off a cliff, killing the driver. And as Lake Powell dries up, archaeologists are getting a chance to study newly emerged Indigenous dwellings. In Las Vegas, the obsession with the Lake Mead remains combines anxiety about the city’s dwindling water supply with the fascination over how mobsters shaped the Mojave Desert outpost into a glittering gambling haven, where pleasure-seekers float down lazy rivers and frolic in colossal pools amid the parched landscape. Now just 30% full, Lake Mead has already fallen to its lowest level since it was filled during the Great Depression, raising fears in places such as Los Angeles, Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, that also draw water from the reservoir below the Hoover Dam. Federal authorities announced this month that they would delay releases from the Colorado River into Lake Mead, about 30 miles east of Las Vegas, dwindling it even more. Jennifer Byrnes, a forensic anthropologist who consults with the coroner’s office in Clark County, which contains Las Vegas, said warming temperatures could reshape her profession. Long-term drought and other changes to the landscape make more grim discoveries possible and require planning for mass casualty events like deadly heat waves, storms and wildfires. “Climate change is directly going to affect our field in the coming years,” said Byrnes, who is also an assistant professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. In some instances, that means help putting down old cases. After a pickup truck with a female body inside was found in a receding lake in Texas in 2014, officials used dental records to identify a woman who had been missing since 1979. Still, Byrnes said, human remains found in places like Lake Mead can be especially challenging. The reservoir is so large that its currents can circulate a body far from where it drowned or was dumped and cause it to break apart. A body in a container like a barrel, she said, could decompose faster than one exposed to water. And scavengers like water bugs, crabs, fish and birds can complicate efforts to determine identities and causes of death. None of that has stopped amateur sleuths from poring over clues in Las Vegas’ hottest new cold cases. So far, police investigators have said they do not expect foul play in connection with the body found by the paddleboarders. But detectives with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said the victim in the barrel appeared to have died from a gunshot wound, likely in the mid-1970s or early 1980s based on clothing and footwear. At the time, even as local authorities sought to downplay the influence of organized crime syndicates, mobsters from Midwest cities like Chicago, Milwaukee and Kansas City, Missouri, wielded immense clout around Las Vegas. Today, the Mafia’s role in Las Vegas is considered insignificant, but nostalgia for the era of made men has emerged as a big moneymaker. For a price of $119.95, visitors can take a “mob tour” that features sites where a car bombing and other underworld activities took place. At the Mob Museum downtown, tourists with beers in hand take in exhibitions describing the city’s blood-splattered past. “This is the town that denied having any connections to the mob,” said John L. Smith, 62, a prominent author and columnist whose family has been in Nevada since the 1880s. “Now it’s a town that puts it on billboards.” As the museum makes clear, barrels were not unheard-of among the Mafia’s body-disposal methods. In 1976, John Roselli, a crime figure with Las Vegas ties, was found floating dead in one in Biscayne Bay outside Miami. And Smith said in a column in The Nevada Independent that the discovery in Lake Mead also evoked memories of a cold case involving Johnny Pappas, a Chicagoan who went missing in Las Vegas in 1976. Pappas, whose underworld associations were noted when he disappeared, managed a resort on Lake Mead backed by a Teamsters pension fund and had been involved in Democratic politics. “Back then, Las Vegas was a much smaller town where half the people were connected or wanted you to think they were connected” to the mob, Smith said. Other theories about the bodies also abound. David Kohlmeier, a retired police officer who is now a podcaster and social media personality, is offering a $5,000 reward to divers who find other remains in Lake Mead. The areas where the two bodies were found, he said, could have been dumping grounds connected to other crimes. “I think this was gang-related in some way, but that could mean it was a motorcycle gang,” Kohlmeier said. Either way, Travis Heggie, a former public risk management specialist for the U.S. National Park Service, said that Lake Mead stood out among national recreation areas and parks for its potential connection to criminal activity — along with places like Big Bend National Park on the border with Mexico. “The criminal element of Las Vegas simply spills over into Lake Mead,” said Heggie, who has long been fascinated about what lies at the reservoir’s depths. Even if no more barrels with bodies in them turn up, he said, “there’s going to be a lot of guns and a lot of knives.” The lake also guards the wreckage of a B-29 Superfortress — one of the largest aircraft used in World War II — that crashed into its waters in 1948, as well as a stunning complex of Ancestral Puebloan ruins, including a structure with more than 100 rooms. Hikers can already trek to St. Thomas, a once-submerged Mormon settlement that has resurfaced in Lake Mead in the form of sun-bleached ruins as the drought grinds on. While Lake Mead has long seen mishaps and foul play, Michael Green, 57, a historian who grew up in Las Vegas, noted that mob figures often preferred to carry out execution-style killings away from the city, in efforts to shield the gambling industry from bad publicity. In one notorious cold case, the influential president of the Riviera hotel, Gus Greenbaum, and his wife, Bess, were shot dead at their Phoenix home after suspicions surfaced that he had been stealing from fellow investors. Green — whose father was a casino dealer with the distinction of being fired by Lefty Rosenthal, the inspiration for the gangster portrayed by Robert De Niro in Martin Scorsese’s 1995 film, “Casino” — has his own theory about the body in the barrel. It revolves around Jay Vandermark, a slot machine supervisor at the Stardust casino who was implicated in a scheme to skim proceeds from slot machines. Vandermark, also thought to have pocketed funds from his mob bosses, went missing in 1976. “I don’t think they ever found the body,” Green said. © 2022 The New York Times Company",U.S./The New York Times,Bodies Pulled From Parched Lake Mead Stir Wise-Guy Ghosts of Las Vegas,https://news.yahoo.com/bodies-pulled-parched-lake-mead-172320326.html

5/21/2022,"As is often the case with sisters, one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s alleged daughters is publicly defying him while the other is defending her daddy dearest. His supposed youngest daughter, Katerina Tikhonova—a dancer—has flown to Munich, Germany, more than 50 times in recent years, according to a report by Russian media outlet iStores and Germany’s Der Spiegel, which surely places her near the top of his list of “pro-West Russians” who he has dissed, saying “their mentality is there, not here, with our people.” Another allegation in the report: The Russian president has also had to stomach—if true—that his youngest daughter’s child with a ballet dancer shares a last name with Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky. The dancer/baby daddy Igor Zelensky is not related to Putin’s archenemy, according to the joint report, which was based on a dossier of leaked documents including flight records showing the Putin kid’s apparent love of European travel to where Zelensky was based during the time they are thought to have conceived their now 2-year-old daughter. Meanwhile, Putin’s eldest daughter Maria Vorontsova—a pediatric endocrinologist—has been outed as the pro-Putin “Maria V.” Russian independent media outlet Republic editor Dmitry Kolezev published screenshots of her rants on Telegram where she attacked critics and left comments on a Moscow State University alumni website quoting her father on topics like Ukraine, the West, George Soros, and gay rights, according to the Times of London. One of the comments criticizes the use of the word “annexation” and in another she says the West has “always done everything possible to ensure that Russia failed as a state.” She wrote, “If suddenly, like almost happened in the 90s, Russia becomes a full-fledged raw-material appendage of the United States and EU, I’ll be interested to see whom you blame for the fact that we’re not living in a prosperous economy.” Both daughters have been placed on sanctions lists by the U.S., but so far have avoided the same in Europe.

5/21/2022,"By Mike Stone WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House is working to put advanced anti-ship missiles in the hands of Ukrainian fighters to help defeat Russia's naval blockade, officials said, amid concerns more powerful weapons that could sink Russian warships would intensify the conflict. Ukraine has made no secret it wants more advanced U.S. capabilities beyond its current inventory of artillery, Javelin and Stinger missiles, and other arms. Kyiv's list, for example, includes missiles that could push the Russian navy away from its Black Sea ports, allowing the restart of shipments of grain and other agricultural products worldwide. Current and former U.S. officials and congressional sources have cited roadblocks to sending longer range, more powerful weapons to Ukraine that include lengthy training requirements, difficulties maintaining equipment, or concerns U.S. weaponry could be captured by Russian forces, in addition to the fear of escalation. But three U.S. officials and two congressional sources said two types of powerful anti-ship missiles, the Harpoon made by Boeing and the Naval Strike Missile made by Kongsberg and Raytheon Technologies were in active consideration for either direct shipment to Ukraine, or through a transfer from a European ally that has the missiles. In April, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed to Portugal to provide the Ukrainian military with Harpoons, which have a range of up to almost 300 km. But there are several issues keeping Ukraine from receiving the missiles. For one, there is limited availability of platforms to launch Harpoons from shore -- a technically challenging solution according to several officials -- as it is mostly a sea-based missile. Two U.S. officials said the United States was working on potential solutions that included pulling a launcher off of a U.S. ship. Both missiles cost about $1.5 million per round, according to experts and industry executives. About 20 Russian Navy vessels, including submarines, are in the Black Sea operational zone, the British defense ministry has said. Bryan Clark, a naval expert at the Hudson Institute, said 12 to 24 anti-ship missiles like the Harpoon with ranges over 100 km would be enough to threaten Russian ships and could convince Moscow to lift the blockade. ""If Putin persists, Ukraine could take out the largest Russian ships, since they have nowhere to hide in the Black Sea,"" Clark said. Russia has already suffered losses at sea, notably the sinking of the cruiser Moskva, the flagship of its Black Sea fleet. WHO GOES FIRST? A handful of countries would be willing to send Harpoons to Ukraine, the U.S. officials and the congressional sources said. But no one wants to be the first or only nation to do so, fearing reprisals from Russia if a ship is sunk with a Harpoon from their stockpile, the third U.S official said. That U.S. official said one country is considering being the first to supply the missile to Ukraine. Once that ""well stocked"" nation commits to sending Harpoons, others might follow, the official said. The Naval Strike Missile (NSM) can be launched from the Ukrainian coast and has a range of 250 km. It also takes less than 14 days training to operate. The sources said NSMs were viewed as less logistically difficult than Harpoons, because NATO allies could loan mobile ground launchers which are available, and warheads from Norway. The first two U.S. officials and the congressional sources said the United States was trying to work out a way for Ukraine to obtain NSM and launchers from European allies. The congressional sources said another option would be for Norway to donate NSMs to Ukraine, an idea supported by Norwegian members of parliament https://mil.in.ua/en/news/norwegian-parliament-is-proposing-to-transfer-the-nasams-air-defense-and-nsm-strike-missiles-to-ukraine. The Norwegian Ministry of Defense declined to comment on what additional contributions of arms and defense equipment it may consider offering to Ukraine. All weapons requests that have U.S. content such as Harpoons and NSMs would have to be approved by the U.S. State Department, which takes guidance from the White House. Another weapon high on Ukraine's shopping list are Multiple Rocket Launch Systems (MLRS) such as the M270 made by Lockheed Martin which can strike a target 70 or more kilometers away, a three-fold increase over many of their current howitzer rounds. In recent weeks, the Biden administration decided instead to send M777 towed howitzers which could be deployed faster and shipped in larger quantities, the two U.S. officials said. The two U.S. officials said the M270 or similar system like the M142 HIMARS would be considered for shipment to Ukraine once Congress passed a $40 billion supplemental funding bill that would authorize an additional $11 billion worth of Presidential Drawdown Authority. That lets the president authorize the transfer of excess weapons from U.S. stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency.

Heihachiro Ono, 56, deputy vice minister for policy planning and co-ordination at the Ministry of Finance (MOF), was intoxicated at the time of the arrest shortly after midnight, NHK said, citing investigative sources. He was accused of hitting and kicking another passenger on the subway, it said.

5/21/2022,"A flight attendant for SpaceX said Elon Musk asked her to ""do more"" during a massage, documents show. The billionaire founder exposed his penis to her and offered to buy her a horse, according to claims in a declaration. After she reported the incident to SpaceX, Musk's company paid her $250,000 as part of a severance agreement. SpaceX, the aerospace firm founded by Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest man, paid a flight attendant $250,000 to settle a sexual misconduct claim against Musk in 2018, Insider has learned. The attendant worked as a member of the cabin crew on a contract basis for SpaceX's corporate jet fleet. She accused Musk of exposing his erect penis to her, rubbing her leg without consent, and offering to buy her a horse in exchange for an erotic massage, according to interviews and documents obtained by Insider. The incident, which took place in 2016, is alleged in a declaration signed by a friend of the attendant and prepared in support of her claim. The details in this story are drawn from the declaration as well as other documents, including email correspondence and other records shared with Insider by the friend. According to the declaration, the attendant confided to the friend that after taking the flight attendant job, she was encouraged to get licensed as a masseuse so that she could give Musk massages. It was during one such massage in a private cabin on Musk's Gulfstream G650ER, she told the friend, that Musk propositioned her. After Insider contacted Musk for comment, he emailed to ask for more time to respond and said there is ""a lot more to this story."" ""If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light,"" he wrote, calling the story a ""politically motivated hit piece."" Insider extended the deadline and reiterated the offer to Musk to comment on the claims. He did not respond. Reached via cell phone, SpaceX vice president of legal Christopher Cardaci said, ""I'm not going to comment on any settlement agreements."" SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment to its general media contact email address. The flight attendant told her friend that the billionaire SpaceX and Tesla founder asked her to come to his room during a flight in late 2016 ""for a full body massage,"" the declaration says. When she arrived, the attendant found that Musk ""was completely naked except for a sheet covering the lower half of his body."" During the massage, the declaration says, Musk ""exposed his genitals"" and then ""touched her and offered to buy her a horse if she would 'do more,' referring to the performance of sex acts."" The attendant, who rides horses, declined and continued with the massage without engaging in any sexual conduct. The attendant ""is not for sale,"" the friend's declaration said. ""She is not going to perform sexual favors for money or gifts."" The incident occurred during a flight to London. In an interview with Insider, the friend described the attendant's allegations in more detail. She spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing fears for her personal safety, but Insider is aware of her identity. Insider is also aware of the flight attendant's identity, but is not naming her because she has claimed to be a victim of sexual misconduct. She declined to comment for this story. ""He whipped out his penis, it was erect,"" the friend said, describing the allegations. ""And he started propositioning her, like he touched her thigh and told her he would buy her a horse. And he basically tried to bribe her to perform some sort of sexual favor."" The friend said that the attendant told her about the misconduct while they were on a hike together shortly after the London trip. The friend described the attendant as distraught and visibly shaken. ""She was really upset,"" the friend said. ""She didn't know what to do."" The flight attendant told her friend that work began to dry up after she refused Musk's advances. ""Before the incident, she regarded Mr. Musk as a person to look up to,"" the declaration says. ""But after he exposed himself, touched her without permission, and offered to pay her for sex, she was full of anxiety."" ""She figured things could just go back to normal and she would pretend like nothing happened,"" the friend told Insider. ""However, she started to feel as if she was receiving some sort of retaliation where her shifts were cut back, and she was starting to feel really stressed."" Eventually, the declaration says, the attendant felt ""she was being pushed out and punished for refusing to prostitute herself."" SpaceX places a special emphasis on massages, going so far as to employ in-house massage therapists as a perk for executives. According to the friend, the flight attendant was encouraged by her superiors to purchase her own professional massage training for her sessions with Musk. ""They encouraged her to get licensed as a masseuse, but on her own time, on her own dime,"" the friend said. ""They implied that she would get to fly more often if she were to do this because she'd be able to give Elon proper massages. I thought that was kind of strange because — you weren't hired to be a masseuse. You were hired to be a flight attendant. And if Elon likes massages, then he should be paying for you to go to masseuse school. But she was just so happy and eager to have the job and be able to travel."" In 2018, after becoming convinced that her refusal to accept Musk's proposal had diminished her opportunities at SpaceX, the attendant hired a California employment lawyer and sent a complaint to the company's human resources department detailing the episode. Around that time, the attorney's firm contacted the friend and asked her to prepare the declaration corroborating the claims. The attendant's complaint was resolved quickly after a session with a mediator that Musk personally attended. The matter never reached a court of law or an arbitration proceeding. In November 2018, Musk, SpaceX and the flight attendant entered into a severance agreement granting the attendant a $250,000 payment in exchange for a promise not to sue over the claims. The agreement also included restrictive non-disclosure and non-disparagement clauses that bar the attendant from ever discussing the severance payment or disclosing any information of any kind about Musk and his businesses, including SpaceX and Tesla. Musk is currently engaged in a bid to purchase Twitter driven by his professed belief that ""free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy."" Earlier this month, he wrote on Twitter that ""sunlight is the best disinfectant."" Twitter did not respond to a request for comment. The friend told Insider that she decided to come forward without consulting the flight attendant because, as a survivor of sexual assault, she felt an obligation to share what she has been told about Musk. Unlike the flight attendant, her friend is not bound by any non-disclosure agreement. ""I absolutely felt a responsibility to come forward with it, especially now,"" she said. ""He is the richest man in the world. Someone with that level of power causing that kind of harm and then throwing some money at the situation, that's not accountability. There are predators all over the world. But when someone is particularly wealthy and powerful, they literally have systems that are like a machine working for them, to set them up to be able to do whatever they want."" Remaining silent, the friend said, would make her complicit. ""When you choose to remain silent, yeah, you do become a part of that system,"" she said. ""You do become a part of that machine that allows someone like Elon Musk to continue to do the horrible things that he's done."" Non-disclosure agreements are crucial components of that machine. The friend said that before she reached out to Insider, she called the attorney who represented the victim. The attorney told her that, although she was free to speak to the press, sharing any documents from the case — including her own declaration — could put the flight attendant at risk. ""Her primary concern was clearly her client,"" the friend said. She recalled the attorney saying that confidentiality provisions are ""bullshit"" and that if any other women have been victimized by Musk, they ought to come forward. But when it came to her client, the attorney urged the friend not to share the declaration. ""That would be a massive problem,"" she told the friend. California, where SpaceX is headquartered, no longer permits companies to require non-disclosure clauses in agreements like the one the attendant signed. Just months after her settlement in 2018, then-Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law the ""Stand Against Non-Disclosure Act,"" which bars the use of NDAs going forward in settlements involving sexual harassment, discrimination, or assault unless they are requested by the plaintiff. The attorney did not respond to requests for comment. ""If there were a way for [her] to come forward without putting herself at risk, without jeopardizing her life in any way, I believe she would,"" the friend of the attendant told Insider. ""I hope she feels like I did the right thing. I hope she feels I said the things that she didn't feel safe enough to say."" This is the only known allegation and settlement for sexual misconduct tied personally to Musk. Two of his companies, however, have faced allegations of sexual harassment in the past. In December 2021, the same week he was named Time's Person of the Year, four women who worked at SpaceX spoke out about sexual harassment they said they faced at the company, where Musk is the CEO. One, Ashley Kosak, published an essay recounting being groped and touched inappropriately by male employees while she was an intern. Three others — one of whom said she was bound by a non-disclosure agreement — recounted similar treatment to the New York Times. In response to the reports, SpaceX president and chief operating officer Gwynne Shotwell sent a company-wide email saying that ""timely reporting of harassment is key to our maintaining SpaceX as a great place to work; we can't fix what we don't know,"" the Times reported. She added that SpaceX will ""rigorously investigate all harassment or discrimination claims and take rapid and appropriate action when we find our policy is violated."" And at least six women have sued Tesla, where Musk is the CEO, alleging sexual harassment at a Tesla factory. Men at the factory ogled women and remarked on their clothes, the complaints said, leading some women to wear baggy outfits and use stacks of boxes to obstruct the views of leering co-workers. Some of the women claimed they were retaliated against when they came forward. The friend told Insider that if anyone else was mistreated by Musk, she hopes they will publicly tell their story. If there are other victims, she said, ""I would like for them to come forward. I would like for the truth to be revealed.""

5/21/2022,"An otherwise healthy man with back pain and a hoarse voice was later found to have lung cancer. The symptoms were caused by tumors on his spine that were interfering with his vocal cords. Lung cancer can be tricky to catch, so see a doctor if you have persistent chest pain or coughing. A fit, otherwise healthy 30-year old was found to have stage 4 lung cancer after experiencing back pain and a hoarse voice, Today reported. Jordan Turko, an entrepreneur who lives in Edmonton, Alberta, told Today that his symptoms started early this year and that he initially suspected COVID-19 after the holidays prompted a surge of coronavirus cases. When symptoms persisted, and the back pain spread into a deep ache in his lower back, pelvis, and legs, Turko visited a walk-in clinic in February, he said. After a series of tests, including a biopsy, chest X-ray, and CT scan, doctors eventually found a 4-inch tumor that they think probably started in January and grew rapidly, Turko told Today. The tumor had wrapped around his pulmonary artery, and other tumors were growing along his spine and had spread to his lymph nodes, liver, pelvis, and leg bones. Turko said he was previously in excellent health, exercised six days a week, and was a fan of hot yoga, so the diagnosis was a shock. ""Who would have guessed that?"" he said. ""Even now, in hindsight, who would be like: 'Oh, your back is in pain. You have lung cancer.'"" As Today noted, lung cancer is rare among younger people, with most cases occurring in those 65 or older and one study estimating that only about 1.4% of cases occur in people under 35. ""Cancer doesn't discriminate, including against young people,"" Turko told Today. ""Be vigilant with your health."" Symptoms of lung cancer may not appear until the illness has progressed, unlike other form of cancers that are easier to spot (and treat) early, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. In some cases, symptoms of cancer — such as fatigue, cough, chest pain, difficulty breathing, unexplained weight loss, or loss of appetite — may be subtle or mistaken for other illnesses. If symptoms such as coughing up blood don't ease or become more severe, it's important to see a doctor, the American Cancer Society says. American Cancer Society further recommends that people who are at higher risk, such as smokers, or who have persistent symptoms should consider being screened early. The persistent hoarse voice that Turko experienced can be a common symptom of lung cancer, caused by the tumor impinging on nerves of the vocal cord. If untreated, the tumor in his spine may have also caused more widespread paralysis, doctors worried, prompting them to recommend emergency radiation treatment. Cancer symptoms can sometimes be overlooked in young patients, including people in their 20s and 30s, Insider previously reported.

5/21/2022,"(Reuters) - Russia's defence ministry on Friday said the last group of Ukrainian forces holed up in Mariupol's smashed Azovstal steel works had surrendered, marking an end to a weeks-long siege. ""The territory of the Azovstal metallurgical plant ... has been completely liberated,"" the ministry said in a statement. It said the group that had given up comprised 531 people. The full abandonment of the bunkers and tunnels of the bombed-out plant means an end to most destructive siege of a war that began when Russia invaded Ukraine nearly three months ago. Ukraine ordered the garrison to stand down on Monday. Hours before the Russian announcement, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the defenders had been told by Ukraine's military that they could get out and save their lives and would most likely all leave in the coming days. ""The underground facilities of the enterprise, where the militants were hiding, came under the full control of the Russian armed forces,"" said the Russian statement, adding that a total of 2,439 defenders had surrendered in the past few days. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has told President Vladimir Putin that both Mariupol and the steel plant have been fully liberated, it said.

5/21/2022,"Warning: This video may be the cutest thing you have seen in a while. Thank you, Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission for capturing it and making our weekend. On Friday, the agency posted a black and white clip on its Facebook page of a beautiful reunion between a Florida panther and her lost kitten, and then gave followers the back story: Back in March, after the 4-month-old somehow got separated from her mother in Collier County, staffers launched a search in the area, to no avail. The kitten was taken to Naples Zoo and a towel with its scent was placed in the area where it was found. When that didn’t work, biologists then tried to attract the Florida panther with her actual baby, by placing the little one in a cage in the same area. After two days, the FWC was almost about to give up, the agency’s post says. Finally, after the third night, Mom finally appeared. Livestream video captures the sweet moment the adult panther happens upon the cage and the kitten begins to meow loudly in recognition. A biologist opened the cage, the Fish and Wildlife says, and out pops the kitten, scampering over to Mama. “Reunited and it feels so good,” reads the text on screen, referencing the classic “Peaches & Herb” song. Later footage shows the pair together walking, Mini Me tailing closely behind. Though the kitten is wearing an expandable collar in the clips, it will soon drop off, the FWC says, adding both animals will be monitored in case they happen to split up again. The post ends with a reminder that Friday is Endangered Species Day, and the Florida panther’s current status is listed as endangered. There are only about 130 left in the wild.

5/21/2022,"Russian soldiers are apparently so sick of Vladimir Putin’s “stupid” war in Ukraine that they are now openly plotting with their own commanders to go AWOL. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s Main Intelligence Directorate released a recording on Thursday that is said to show precisely that happening, with a soldier heard in a purportedly intercepted phone call detailing the plan. The soldier, identified by Ukrainian intelligence as one of many men “mobilized” by authorities in occupied Donetsk, complains that he and others in his battalion are so under-equipped that even the Chechen forces fighting alongside them mock them as “meat.” “Everyone who is here … I’m telling you … everyone is planning to take off on the 26th,” the purported soldier says. “Isn’t that stupid?” says the other man, apparently a relative back home. “Isn’t it stupid that we’re here?” the unnamed soldier shoots back. He goes on to explain that the troops have decided to abscond “on the basis of the fact that they put us on the front with absolutely nothing.” Russia Uses Ukraine’s Azovstal POWs in Demented New Propaganda Plot “I want to tell you even more,” he says, adding that a “battalion commander is leaving with us and even a staff colonel.” “They don’t provide us with any [equipment],” he says, adding that the rifles given to snipers are “from 1945.” Other units “look at them and go, ‘Holy shit, what would you need those for?’ They laugh at us. You know what they call us? Blessed. We ask, ‘Why blessed?’ They say because we are walking around with no equipment, no helmets, without anything. … The Chechens call us meat.” “It’s not desertion, because we shouldn’t be on this territory… We crossed the border as 200s,” he says, using a Russian military term for those killed in battle. “We’re not actually here. So if they say I’m a deserter, fuck off, I’m not here. Prove otherwise.” Other Russian soldiers are said to have taken equally drastic measures to get themselves out of the war. Ukrainian intelligence has released several recordings in recent days that purportedly show Russian soldiers resorting to injuring themselves in an effort to get pulled from the war. On Thursday, Ukraine’s Security Service released another recording said to reveal that trend. In the purportedly intercepted call between two Russian soldiers, one of the men tells his friend that fighting is getting more and more intense by the day, and despite daily fatalities, the military leadership is not providing backup. “Take someone else’s weapon, a Ukrainian one, and shoot yourself in the legs,” his friend advises.

5/21/2022,"(Adds comments from U.S. general in Europe) WASHINGTON, May 19 (Reuters) - The top U.S. military officer, General Mark Milley, spoke by telephone with Russia's Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov, the Pentagon said on Thursday, the first conversation between the two since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. ""The military leaders discussed several security-related issues of concern and agreed to keep the lines of communication open,"" said a spokesman for Milley, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""In accordance with past practice, the specific details of their conversation will be kept private,"" the spokesman added. The U.S. military readout did not mention any specific issues that were discussed. RIA news agency, citing the Russian defense ministry, said the two military leaders discussed issues of ""mutual interest,"" including Ukraine. The call took place after U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Russian counterpart last week, and the Pentagon chief called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine. The United States and Russia have established a hotline since the invasion - which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"" - began on Feb. 24 to prevent miscalculation and any widening of the conflict. The ""deconfliction"" hotline is an open phone line based at the European Command's headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany, and falls under Air Force General Tod Wolters, who leads all U.S. forces in Europe. Speaking in Brussels on Thursday, Wolters said he hoped the call between Milley and Gerasimov was one step closer to a diplomatic solution in Ukraine. Still, there appears to be little momentum on the diplomatic front, more than two months after the start of Russia's invasion, which has left thousands dead or injured, reduced towns and cities to rubble, and forced more than 5 million people to flee abroad.

The Daily Dot reported the woman had tried to pay at the restaurant with a PayPal card but the transaction declined.

These include cases where minors are raped, she said. A one-year-old boy died after being raped by two Russian soldiers, the Ukrainian Parliament's Commissioner for Human Rights said on Thursday. The accusation is one of the most horrific from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but is not unique. Denisova Liudmyla Leontiivna said in the statement that it gets reports of sexual violence against Ukrainians every day, including against children. Leontiivna did not give further details of what is alleged to have happened, but said that the report had been received in the previous 24 hours. Insider could find no independent evidence for the claim. The majority of new reports were coming from around Kharkiv, she said, though did not give a specific location for the allegation about the one-year-old. Most reports were made by relatives or, for those who did not die, by the victims themselves, she said. Russian forces have this week been withdrawing from the area around Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, which had long been subject to heavy attacks. The commissioner said on Thursday that her office recieved 10 reports of sexual violence in one hour on Thursday, including eight cases of minors being raped. ""I appeal to the UN Commission for Investigation Human Rights Violations during the Russian military invasion of Ukraine to take into account these facts of genocide of the Ukrainian people,"" Leontiivna said.

Anthony Harvey/Shutterstock  Ahead of the festival, Cannes organizers issued a statement boycotting Russian delegations from participating in the event. They said, according to The Hollywood Reporter, ""As the world has been hit by a heavy crisis in which a part of Europe finds itself in a state of war, the Festival de Cannes wishes to extend all its support to the people of Ukraine and all those who are in its territory."" ""However modest as it is, we join our voices with those who oppose this unacceptable situation and denounce the attitude of Russia and its leaders,"" they continued. ""Our thoughts go out in particular to the Ukrainian artists and film industry professionals, as well as their families whose lives are now in danger. There are those whom we've never met, and those whom we've come to know and welcomed to Cannes, who came with works that say much about Ukraine's history and the present."" The statement added, ""... Unless the war of assault ends in conditions that will satisfy the Ukrainian people, it has been decided that we will not welcome official Russian delegations nor accept the presence of anyone linked to the Russian government."" ""However, we would like to salute the courage of all those in Russia who have taken risks to protest against the assault and invasion of Ukraine,"" the Cannes statement continued. ""Among them are artists and film professionals who have never ceased to fight against the contemporary regime, who cannot be associated with these unbearable actions, and those who are bombing Ukraine."" ""Loyal to its history that started in 1939 in resistance to the fascist and Nazi dictatorship, the Festival de Cannes will always serve artists and industry professionals that raise their voices to denounce violence, repression and injustices, for the main purpose to defend peace and liberty,"" the statement concluded. Russia's attack on Ukraine continues after their forces launched a large-scale invasion on Feb. 24 — the first major land conflict in Europe in decades. Details of the fighting change by the day, but hundreds of civilians have already been reported dead or wounded, including children. Millions of Ukrainians have also fled, the United Nations said. The Russian attack on Ukraine is an evolving story, with information changing quickly.

5/21/2022,"A South Carolina man, who has been in prison for seven years for a deadly Rock Hill fire that killed his baby brother, was denied parole Wednesday. However, even with that denial, it appears under state law that Jacob Matthew Morgan could be released from prison as early as December. At that point he would have served about half of a 15-year sentence. Morgan, now 24, was denied a chance at release Wednesday by the unanimous vote of a panel of the S.C. Parole Board after a video conference hearing, said Valerie Suber, associate deputy director of the S.C. Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services. The parole board had gathered in Columbia. Morgan appeared in the parole hearing from MacDougall Correctional Institute in Berkeley County. It was his second parole hearing after he was denied in May 2021. Joshua Hill, Morgan’s younger brother, was 14 months old when he died in the March 2015 mobile home fire in York County, just outside Rock Hill. Morgan was babysitting at the time. The incident captured national attention. Morgan pleaded guilty in 2016 under what is called an Alford plea, a negotiated agreement with prosecutors where Morgan did not have to admit guilt but accepted there was evidence against him that would likely convict him. The agreement came after he had been indicted on charges of first-degree arson and murder and faced up to life in prison. Morgan was convicted in 2016 on charges of third-degree arson, involuntary manslaughter and child neglect. Morgan did not admit guilt Wednesday. Parole Board chairman Henry Eldridge, of Tega Cay in York County, said Morgan was convicted of a serious charge and asked Morgan how he felt about it. “Not a day goes by that I don’t regret my brother’s death,” Morgan replied to Eldridge via teleconference. “I would gladly change places with him.” Eldridge then asked Morgan why he became involved in the deadly incident. Morgan replied that he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but did not elaborate. Morgan acknowledged in the hearing after a statement from Eldridge that he has received mental health treatment while in prison. Eldridge asked Morgan if he would work if released from prison to live with his mother. “I can work if it’s necessary,” Morgan said. “I have to be responsible for my own life.” The hearing ended with no more questions. Eldridge told Morgan the parole board would vote and Morgan would be advised of the vote results. The vote was released shortly afterward. Parole board hearings are public meetings. The Herald, a part of McClatchy company, obtained permission from South Carolina parole officials to watch Wednesday’s hearing. There were no other speakers at the hearing. In 2021 Morgan’s mother spoke as an advocate for him to be released. The 2016 guilty plea and sentence, later discussions about Morgan and the case, were covered by local media and other outlets such as CNN Headline News, the Daily Mail from the United Kingdom, and regional media in both Carolinas. Police and prosecutors said in court in 2016 that Morgan set fire in at least two places in the mobile home, and did not call for help despite having a cellphone. Prosecutors said in 2016 that Morgan had set a fire two weeks before the fatal incident. Police and prosecutors said in court that Morgan lied to cover up the crime and knew that his brother would die in the fire. Sixteenth Circuit Solicitor Kevin Brackett said Wednesday, after Morgan was denied parole, that Morgan should serve his full sentence. There was no question the fatal fire was set intentionally and a child died, Brackett said. “It is appropriate that Mr Morgan serve his full sentence in this case,” Brackett said. Morgan’s lawyer from arrest through the 2016 guilty plea, 16th Circuit Public Defender B.J. Barrowclough, said Morgan deserves parole. “It is extremely disappointing that Jacob Morgan was denied parole again today,” Barrowclough said in a statement to The Herald. “When he went to prison he was a gentle and soft-hearted young man who had endured a difficult childhood. A quick review of his incarceration on the SCDC website shows he’s had no disciplinaries. His crime, even from the State’s perspective, was one of recklessness, not evil intent. And I know the victim’s family, which is his family, want him home because they never wanted him incarcerated in the first place. To deny this young man parole is an indictment of the parole system.” Morgan was sentenced to 15 years in prison for all three convictions, court records. The S.C. Department of Corrections Web site shows that Morgan is eligible for release from prison in December. His release date is Dec. 23. Chrysti Shain, spokesperson for the corrections department, said South Carolina law allows inmates to reduce their sentences by earning work and educational credits. In the 2021 parole hearing, Morgan said he earned a General Equivalency Diploma to graduate high school while in prison.",U.S./Rock Hill Herald,Rock Hill SC man again denied parole after conviction in fire that killed baby brother,https://news.yahoo.com/rock-hill-sc-man-again-202439343.html
5/21/2022,"OROVILLE, Calif. (AP) — A tree trimmer in rural Northern California was found guilty in a series of throat-slashing attacks that left three people dead, prosecutors announced Wednesday. A jury in Butte County on Tuesday found Ryan Scott Blinston, 37, guilty of murder, attempted murder and arson, the Tehama County District Attorney's office said. Blinston, of Oroville, faces a mandatory term of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Blinston was working for a tree-trimming service when in 2020 he returned to the clients’ homes in Butte and Tehama Counties, north of Sacramento, after the work was completed and slashed the throats of the residents, prosecutors said. In May 2020, he attacked Loreen Severs, 88, of Los Molinos in Tehama County and her husband, Homer Severs, 91. Homer Severs survived the attack but died that December of an unrelated illness, authorities said. Blinston was also charged in the killing of Sandra George, 82, and an acquaintance, Vicky Cline, 57, both of Oroville in Butte County. He was also charged with torching Cline’s car. The District Attorney for Tehama and Butte counties agreed to combine the charges and have the case tried in Butte County, prosecutors said. Blinston was arrested before dawn on June 14, 2020 — about a week after Cline vanished — by a Butte County sheriff’s SWAT team that had tracked him to a motorhome in heavily wooded and isolated Brush Creek, where authorities planned to arrest him on suspicion of burning Cline’s car, prosecutors said. The team approached the motorhome and heard the muffled screams of a man inside and loud banging on the outside of the motorhome. The banging turned out to be Blinston attempting to get into the motorhome with a hatchet, prosecutors said. Blinston ran into the woods, refused to drop the hatchet and was captured after a short struggle and the use of a stun gun and pepper spray, authorities said. Blinston had met the 50-year-old owner of the motorhome earlier and then stayed over because he told the man he was afraid to leave after dark because of bears, the resident told authorities. The man said he was sleeping when he awoke to find Blinston attacking him with a knife, prosecutors said. Blinston slashed his neck but the man said he was able to kick him out of the motorhome and lock the door. A medic treated the seriously injured man and he was airlifted to a hospital, they said. The SWAT team may have saved the man’s life, prosecutors said, because the isolated area had no cellphone service and it was unlikely anyone would have heard the man’s cries for help. Prosecutors didn't mention a motive for the crimes other than to say robbery was not a motivating factor.",U.S./Associated Press,California tree trimmer guilty in deadly throat-slashings,https://news.yahoo.com/california-tree-trimmer-guilty-deadly-233436761.html
