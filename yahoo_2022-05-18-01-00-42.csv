5/18/2022,"Keeping up the returns would be a neat trick in today’s market, as the main indexes are all steeply down for the year so far – with losses of 15% on the S&P 500 and 24% on the NASDAQ. For investors, then, the best strategy may just be to follow a winner. Billionaire investing legend George Soros is most definitely a winner. He’s built a portfolio worth billions, and had possibly the greatest bull run in hedge fund history, averaging 30% annualized returns for 30 years. Starting in 1992, when he shorted the Pound Sterling and made $1 billion in 24 hours, to his most recent 13F filings, Soros has a record of success that few investors can match. Today, Soros remains the chair of Soros Fund Management and is thought to be worth over $8 billion, a figure which would have been far greater but for the billionaire’s extensive philanthropic work. So, when Soros takes out new positions for his stock portfolio, it is only natural for investors to sit up and take notice. With this in mind, we decided to take a look at three stocks his fund has recently loaded up on. Soros is not the only one showing confidence in these names; according to the TipRanks database, Wall Street’s analysts rate all three as Strong Buys and see plenty of upside on the horizon too. Stem, Inc. (STEM) First up is Stem, a tech company that specializes in using artificial intelligence (AI) to create ‘smart’ storage systems for clean energy. In other words, that company is designing thinking batteries that are optimized for use with renewable energy production schemes. Energy storage is a major bottleneck when it comes to renewables; as we all know, you can power the grid with wind or solar if the breezes die down or night falls. Smart batteries will let producers squeeze higher efficiencies from optimal generation times. The company’s main product is the Athena software platform, that uses a combination of AI and machine learning to optimize the switches between grid power, on-site generated power, and battery power. The customer base includes public utilities, major corporations, and various project developers and installers. Stem estimates that its total addressable market will increase 25x by the year 2050, to reach $1.2 trillion. So Stem is getting in at the beginning of what may be a boom. And the company’s revenue growth would suggest that the ‘boom potential’ is real. The top line grew 166% from 1Q21 to 1Q22, rising from $15.4 million to $41.1 million in one year, and coming in 29% above the high end of the previously published guidance. The company’s quarterly bookings almost tripled, from $51 million one year ago to $151 million in 1Q22. And, despite running quarterly net losses, Stem finished the first quarter this year with a usable balance of $352 million in cash and liquid assets. All of this caught the attention of George Soros, who’s bought up 300,000 shares of Stem in Q1. These shares are worth $2.25 million at current prices. Guggenheim analyst Joseph Osha, rated 5-stars at TipRanks, is also bullish here. He notes that the company’s Q1 results beat his expectations, and then adds, “STEM still faces a multi-year period during which much of the company’s revenue is likely to consist of low-margin storage hardware sales, but our confidence is growing that the company should be able to earn good returns by managing and dispatching storage assets. At this point, the company’s full-year targets appear reasonable, in our view, and in fact the annualized recurring revenue target of $60–80 million by yearend looks conservative to us."" These comments back up Osha’s Buy rating on STEM stock, while his $16 price target indicates room for ~115% upside in the next 12 months. (To watch Osha’s track record, click here) For the most part, Wall Street’s analysts agree that this is a stock to buy. Stem shares have 5 recent analyst reviews, including 4 Buys over 1 Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $7.49 and its $16.40 average price target suggests its has ~120% upside ahead of it. (See STEM stock forecast on TipRanks) Webster Financial (WBS) The next Soros pick is Webster Financial. This is a holding company, the parent of Webster Bank. This Connecticut-based banking firm has approximately $65 billion in assets and offers a range of services, including consumer and commercial banking, personal and business loans, and wealth management. Webster has a commitment to growth, and in February of this year it completed its merger with Sterling Bancorp. With that transaction complete, Webster now has $44 billion in loans, $53 billion in deposits, and a network of 202 branches in the Northeast. Webster’s first quarter of 2022 showed a net interest income of $394 million, up 76% year-over-year. The company’s interest-generating assets showed substantial growth over the past year, increasing from $19.2 billion to $50.3 billion, a gain of 61%. Webster increased its loans and leases outstanding by 67%, from$14.4 billion to $35.9 billion, and saw its average deposits increase from $17.6 billion to $45.9 billion, or 62%. These gains in income and income generation supported Webster’s continued payment of its dividend, which was declared in April at 40 cents per common share. With an annualized rate of $1.60 per share, the dividend currently yields 3.45%. Turning to Soros’ activity here, the billionaire purchased 42,100 shares of WBS stock in Q1, which are now worth a total of $2.02 million. Soros isn’t the only one giving this stock some love. 5-star analyst William Wallace, of Raymond James, puts a Strong Buy rating here, and a $73 target price that suggests ~52% upside in the year ahead. (To watch Wallace’s track record, click here) Backing his bullish stance, Wallace writes: “All in, our thesis remains unchanged, where we believe cost and growth targets from the Sterling deal are attainable, and the financial merits of the deal continue to be mispriced, leaving room for upside. That said, as progress is shown towards deal targets, which look increasingly reasonable, we believe shares should recover their discount and ultimately trade at a premium relative to its mid-cap peer group valuation comparison.” Overall, of the 8 recent analyst reviews published for WBS, 6 are Buys and 2 are Holds, backing a Strong Buy rating. The stock has an average price target of $70.25, implying ~47% upside from the share price of $47.81. (See WBS stock forecast on TipRanks) Synovus Financial Corporation (SNV) Let’s wrap up with Synovus, another denizen of the financial world. This financial services company, based in Columbus, Georgia, commands some $56 billion in assets and has 272 branches across the Southeast, in Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. This is a high-growth region, known as one of the country’s economic drivers. Florida is the country’s third-largest state, and Tennessee, with no state income tax, hits above its weight in attracting business growth. This is Synovus’ playing field. In 1Q22, Synovus reported a year-over-year drop in earnings. Diluted EPS fell from $1.19 in the year-ago quarter to $1.11 in the current report. At the same time, the bank increased its loan business in the quarter. Total loans grew from $38.8 billion one year ago to $40.1 billion as of March 31. Total deposits grew a modest 3%, from $47.3 billion to $48.6 billion. Synovus still felt confident to boost its dividend payment for the first time since the start of 2020. In its March declaration, the company increased the common share dividend from 33 cents to 34 cents. At an annualized payment of $1.36, this gives a yield of 3.5%. Soros liked what he saw here, and in the last quarter he bought 40,800 shares. At current prices, these are now worth $1.65 million. The controversial billionaire wasn’t the only bull on Synovus. In coverage for Wells Fargo, analyst Jared Shaw writes, “The effects of streamlining the franchise, reducing overall credit risk, expansion into faster growing FL markets, and a head start on digital offerings were materializing throughout 2021, with increased momentum providing a boost year to date. We believe SNV reached an inflection point in 2021, and think the asset sensitivity combined with an upgraded management growth outlook for '24 will drive shares higher.” To this end, Shaw gives SNV stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, and his price target, of $65, indicates potential for 60% appreciation in the next 12 months. (To watch Shaw’s track record, click here) All in all, this stock gets a unanimous Strong Buy from the Street’s consensus, based on 7 recent analyst reviews. The stock is selling for $40.6 and its $58.71 average price target suggests ~45% upside from that level.

5/18/2022,"The brutal rout in tech stocks has rattled even the most veteran of industry followers, who warned that the selling pressure may still get worse. ""Right now we are seeing [tech] stocks trade at single-digit multiples on EBITDA and low double digits on earnings, which is kind of unheard of from what we have seen the last decade for tech,"" Jefferies tech analyst Brent Thill said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""Our belief is we are not done with the pressure on tech. We still think there is downside relative to historic multiples."" To be sure, the carnage in tech has been vast and painful for the bulls as fears of rising interest rates and slowing growth whip through Wall Street. Just take the major sell-off in one of the hottest tech trades of the past decade: the FAANG complex, which is comprised of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google. All five components have shed more than 17% year-to-date, led by a nearly 69% crash for Netflix. Netflix shares are currently trading on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of about 17 times, which is relatively in line with the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance Plus data. This marks the lowest P/E multiple for Netflix in more than five years. Other tech stalwarts haven't been spared either — Microsoft is lower by more than 21% on the year and Salesforce is down by 35%. For these household names, the declines have brought valuations down to levels once unthinkable in recent memory, raising the question: Has a bubble in the tech sector burst? ""Absolutely,"" TKer.co's Sam Ro told Yahoo Finance recently. ""Some of these stocks are getting smoked... In many ways, you could say that the bubble has burst."" The pullback in tech valuations has impacted funding rounds for private companies — and even Elon Musk's deal for Twitter. Thill believes Musk's new effort to tally fake accounts is a tactic to get a lower price for Twitter amid broader market pressure. ""We believe he is just trying to negotiate a lower price,"" Thill added. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

Berkshire also reported new stakes in banking giant Citigroup Inc. and in auto lender Ally Financial Inc. Berkshire sold off its remaining Wells Fargo shares after months of paring a holding that once ranked as the conglomerate’s biggest common-stock bet. Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive officer, began building the investment three decades ago and has long lauded its business, sticking by the firm after its scandals began erupting in 2016. Buffett’s exit comes as Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf continues to grapple with legacy regulatory issues and takes steps to improve efficiency, which include job cuts and the exploration of potential sales of businesses. The San Francisco-based bank’s shares have declined about 12% this year. Buffett had publicly urged the Wells Fargo board not to hire a leader from Wall Street. Though Scharf has a track record of running consumer-facing businesses and improving them with technology, his resume featured time at securities-industry giant JPMorgan Chase & Co., and more recently atop Bank of New York Mellon Corp. Scharf also struck an agreement to work from New York, instead of the San Francisco headquarters, a move Buffett’s business partner, Charlie Munger, called “outrageous.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Tech’s High-Flying Startup Scene Gets a Crushing Reality Check The Tighter Labor Market Is Making Restaurants More Like Factories China’s Pullback on Lending Stalls Dreams of Rebuilding Nigeria Venture Capitalists Are Aiming to Disrupt Fish Farming What Happened When a Wall Street Investment Giant Moved to Nashville ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•18 hours ago,"Buffett Exits Wells Fargo Stake, Ending Decades-Long Bet on Bank",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buffett-exits-wells-fargo-stake-222644947.html

5/18/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- As the ruble’s official exchange rate parts ways with its value on the street, dollars are becoming hard to find. Most Read from Bloomberg One-Time Richest Singapore Tycoon Has Lost 80% of His Fortune Meet the Hedge-Fund Manager Who Warned of Terra’s $60 Billion Implosion Omicron Is Turning Out to Be a Weak Vaccine Elon Musk Says Twitter Must Prove Bot Claims for $44 Billion Deal to Proceed U.S. Stocks Extend Losses in Late Session Selloff: Markets Wrap For Boris, a doctor based in Moscow, the search got so desperate that he pondered a high-tech, and seemingly improbable, black-market scheme that a friend was pushing. After interacting with a bot via messenger app, his acquaintance transferred rubles electronically to receive a barcode that he scanned to access a safe storage box at a Moscow mall. The 1,000 euros ($1,040) he’d ordered were sitting inside. “Banks either have no foreign currency, or, if they do, they sell it at a bad rate,” said Boris, 35, who requested that his surname not be used due to the sensitivity of the matter. Still, “you’d have to really trust the system to do that. I wouldn’t risk it,” he said. Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine has put the economy on track for its sharpest contraction in decades. But the Russian currency is up about 25% against the U.S. dollar since the invasion began, giving it the incongruous title of best performer globally. While that’s allowed Putin to brag that the sanctions “Blitzkrieg” of the West has failed, ordinary Russians can’t take advantage of the currency’s strength. Oil flows and capital controls have warped the official rate, and the ruble is around 20% weaker at exchange points and on the black market -- reminding many Russians of its Soviet predecessor. “It’s like trying to show the Soviet Union is beating America by waving a copy of the Izvestia newspaper in someone’s face in 1982 and saying: ‘Look, the dollar is worth only 64 kopecks!”’ said Sergey Khestanov, a Moscow-based professor of finance and banking and advisor to the chief of executive of the Otkritie brokerage. “I’d agree -- if anyone could actually buy a dollar for 64 kopecks.” Tough Rules Under the central bank’s latest rules, lenders can only sell dollars and euros they’ve received since April 9. Individuals can withdraw hard currency, but only from accounts opened before March 9 and not more than the equivalent of $10,000 before September. The limit for physically carrying out cash when going abroad is also $10,000. In an echo of the illegal money changers operating in the late Soviet period, middlemen working in cahoots with bank employees lure buyers with rates that beat the official ones posted in currency exchanges. As in the past, there’s always a danger of walking away with counterfeit notes, according to Boris. He eventually opted for the middleman and paid 15% more than the official rate to buy $2,000 for his his ex-wife and children. They needed cash on hand for a holiday in Turkey since sanctions stopped Russian-issued credit cards from working abroad. On Monday, banks were selling dollars on average for 20% more than the ruble price quoted on the Moscow Exchange, according to a survey of about 70 Moscow banks and exchange points by the RBC and Banki.ru financial websites. Black-market rates shown in currency exchange channels on messenger apps ranged from 73 rubles to 76 rubles in Moscow on Tuesday, while the ruble was little changed at 63.35 per dollar as of 2:22 p.m. in Moscow. That may be a far cry from the giant gap between official and black market rates in a country like Zimbabwe, but the discrepancy in Russia reflects the reality of an economy that’s never been this isolated in its post-Soviet history. Sanctions severing Russia from the global banking system and emergency capital controls at home are choking off imports and making large-scale capital flight impossible. At the same time, international penalties have been carefully crafted to allow countries to continue buying Russia’s oil, gas and other commodities, keeping billions of dollars flowing into Kremlin coffers each week. Read More: Russia Current Account Surplus Jumps to Record Despite Sanctions Defending the lopsided US approach, Secretary of State Antony Blinken dismissed the ruble’s rally at the start of April as “not sustainable.” The currency has appreciated 30% since Blinken spoke, but Tatha Ghose at Commerzbank AG agrees with him. “The exchange rate no longer has any forward-looking component because sanctions and capital controls prevent meaningful capital flow,” Ghose wrote in a report. The ruble is moved by “day-to-day current demand and supply for trading those items which are still possible to export and import.” Even the Bank of Russia admitted in its latest monetary report that sanctions have essentially turned the rate into a blunt expression of the country’s trade balance. As an embargo on oil and gas by European governments kicks in by late 2022, Ghose predicts the ruble will slump 10% by year-end and a further 20% by the end of 2023. To be sure, some ruble weakness would be welcomed by the Finance Ministry. The dollar price of Russia’s main Urals blend of crude oil is falling and the currency’s appreciation means the government collects ever fewer rubles per barrel, imperiling its budget revenue targets. Russia will be left with “virtually no cushion for the economic slump and the financial pressures of the protracted war in Ukraine,” TS Lombard’s Christopher Granville and Madina Khrustaleva wrote in a note. Back on the dollar trail in Moscow, Sofya, 22, a student, managed to buy $550 dollars at an official exchange point on her third attempt. She’s getting the cash together to take to her boyfriend, who she packed off to Prague amid constant speculation Putin will announce a national call-up as the war drags on. Her tip: set out early and contact the banks in advance to avoid disappointment. “The exchange rate was bad, way higher than the official rate,” she said. “But at least they weren’t charging a 30% commission like they were in February.” (Adds current ruble trading in 12th paragraph) Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Tech’s High-Flying Startup Scene Gets a Crushing Reality Check The Tighter Labor Market Is Making Restaurants More Like Factories China’s Pullback on Lending Stalls Dreams of Rebuilding Nigeria Venture Capitalists Are Aiming to Disrupt Fish Farming What Happened When a Wall Street Investment Giant Moved to Nashville ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•4 hours ago,Putin Sets Russians on Wild Hunt for Dollars in Black Market,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/putin-sends-russians-wild-hunt-063947039.html

5/18/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- The investment firms of some of the world’s wealthiest investors made some large shifts in their assets last quarter as US stocks slumped by the most since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.

It also exited Airbnb Inc. and Starbucks Corp., while placing new bets on companies including Teck Resources Ltd. and Coterra Energy Inc. Duquesne also added to its already large position in Chevron Corp., which touched a record high on Monday. The S&P 500 Index fell about 5% in the first quarter, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 plunged 9%, as investors weighed how US companies and the world’s largest economy would fare as the Federal Reserve lifts interest rates to combat the highest inflation in decades. Energy companies have done better as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine keeps oil prices near recent highs. George Soros’s family office, Soros Fund Management, saw its US equity positions fall by almost $2 billion in the first quarter to $5.2 billion, due in large part to a decline in the value of its stake in electric-vehicle maker Rivian Automotive Inc. It ditched holdings in IHS Markit Ltd. and Activision Blizzard Inc., while adding $122 million of Zynga Inc. shares. Wildcat Capital Management, the family office of TPG Inc. co-founder David Bonderman, added new positions in companies including Frontier Communications Parent Inc. and Marqeta Inc., while selling out of Procore Technologies Inc. and Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. It didn’t touch its largest holding, Skillz Inc., a mobile gaming platform that tumbled 60% in the first three months of the year. An investment firm for the Walton family, which mostly buys and sells low-cost exchange-traded funds, added to its position in US municipal debt and took a big stake in Japanese equities, while also betting on small-cap stocks and Coinbase Global Inc. It held about $5.1 billion in US stocks and ETFs at the end of last quarter. Hong Kong-based Blue Pool Capital, which manages part of the fortunes of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. co-founders Joe Tsai and Jack Ma, exited three stocks: Adobe Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and XPeng Inc. Its $628.5 million is now almost entirely invested in Blue Owl Capital Inc. US Securities and Exchange Commission rules require investors managing more than $100 million in US equities to disclose their holdings, though family offices can appeal to keep these documents confidential.

Shell and its partners paid just over $1 billion for the rights to explore the three blocks. The three wells Exxon Mobil has drilled in Brazil’s waters since late 2020 are also non-commercial, which cost $1.6 billion to access. Brazil has sold more than $10 billion worth of exploration acreage to Petroleo Brasileiro SA -- the nation’s most dominant explorer -- and international majors since 2017. So far, the world’s most experienced drillers have little to show for it. The last knock-out oil discovery in Brazil was made by Petrobras more than a decade ago, and the underwhelming results since then could indicate the biggest fields in the country’s so-called pre-salt region have already been found. “Shell has had a string of failures similar to Exxon,” said de Assis. “All the blocks acquired by Shell were unsuccessful” so far. The drillship contract Exxon had for the first three wells has expired and the company doesn’t plan to put out a tender for a new rig until next year, according to two people familiar with its exploration program. Exxon said the company doesn’t comment on operational or commercial plans. For Brazil, it means that although oil production will double this decade from the fields it’s currently developing, output will then decline in the 2030s unless new reservoirs are identified for future exploitation. TotalEnergies SE is currently drilling a high-profile well where last week it reported signs of oil and gas to Brazil’s oil regulator, known as the ANP. It’s unclear to the domestic industry, which closely watches the exploration programs, if the discovery is big enough to warrant development. Even Rio de Janeiro-based Petrobras has seen its success rate falter. Shell declined to comment on the results from its three wells. Exxon said it recently completed its initial exploration drilling program and is evaluating the findings and implications for future activity. TotalEnergies said it’s still drilling at the C-M-541 block in the Campos Basin and doesn’t have anything to communicate at this time. Petrobras said it believes in the pre-salt’s potential and that its business plan calls for more exploration in the region. A flurry of wells in recent years by Petrobras has only produced two prospects where it’s confident enough to pay for follow-up drilling, and it won’t know if these are commercially viable until later this year at the earliest, said de Assis. For now, Petrobras is riding the coattails of pre-salt fields such as Buzios and Mero in the Santos Basin discovered more than a decade ago. The fields Petrobras has found since are either smaller and keep getting pushed to the back end of its business plan, or have a high concentration of carbon dioxide that will require technological advances to separate it from the oil in an economically viable way, said Andre Fagundes, who covers Brazil for Welligence, an energy consultancy. “Otherwise, we don’t see any hope with these recent discoveries,” he said. During the early 2010s, Petrobras boasted a 100% exploration success rate, and since then it has fallen closer to what is seen in other oil regions. Globally, only 24.8% of offshore exploration wells were successful in 2020, according to Rystad Energy, a consultancy. Industry observers are becoming discouraged about the outlook for new fields at Brazil’s largest two offshore basins. Explorers need to focus on areas further north that have yet to deliver the kinds of reservoirs that made the country Latin America’s biggest producer and exporter this century. “In Santos and Campos, the big discoveries have already been made,” said Adriano Pires, a consultant who was briefly in the running to become the chief executive officer of Petrobras a month ago. “In the Equatorial Margin, we could still have surprising discoveries.” (Updates with details on Exxon’s drilling program in 5th paragraph) Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Tech’s High-Flying Startup Scene Gets a Crushing Reality Check The Tighter Labor Market Is Making Restaurants More Like Factories Venture Capitalists Are Aiming to Disrupt Fish Farming What Happened When a Wall Street Investment Giant Moved to Nashville How Gillette Embraced the Beard to Win Over Scruffy Millennials ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•22 hours ago,Shell Joins Exxon With $1 Billion Brazil Exploration Setback,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-joins-exxon-1-billion-173100735.html
