1/18/2022,"By Gloria Dickie (Reuters) - Tonga’s massive underwater volcanic eruption could deliver long-lasting damage to coral reefs, erode coastlines and disrupt fisheries, say scientists studying satellite images and looking to the past to project the future of the remote region: ACID RAIN Since the initial eruption, the volcano has been releasing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide — two gases that create acid rain when they interact with water and oxygen in the atmosphere. With Tonga’s tropical climate, “there is likely to be acid rain around Tonga for a while to come,” said volcanologist Shane Cronin at the University of Auckland. Acid rain causes widespread crop damage, and could ruin Tongan staples like taro, corn, bananas and garden vegetables. “Depending on how long the eruptions last, food security could be compromised,” Cronin said. Satellite imagery shows the plume spreading westward, which means Tonga could be spared some of this acid rain though Fiji could then be in its path. In a bulletin on Monday, the U.N. humanitarian affairs office said Fiji was monitoring its air quality, and has advised people to cover their household water tanks and stay indoors in the event of rain. FISH DIE-OFFS Tonga’s exclusive economic zone of nearly 700,000 marine square kilometres (270,271 square miles) is 1,000 times larger than its land area. And most Tongans get their food — and livelihood — from the ocean. While scientists have yet to investigate on the ground, “the few pictures that are available seem to show a blanket ... of ash” on land, said Marco Brenna, a geologist at the University of Otago in New Zealand. In the ocean, that ash can be harmful to marine life. Weeks before Saturday’s eruption, Tonga Geological Services had warned that nearby seawater was contaminated with toxic volcanic discharge, and that fishermen should “assume fish in these waters are poisoned or poisonous.” Inevitably, the eruption has made the situation worse. Murky, ash-filled water near the volcano will deprive fish of food and wipe out spawning beds. Some fish will perish, and survivors will be forced to migrate, scientists said. Further changes in the structure of the sea floor could create new obstacles for fishing vessels. “It will be a while before the same or new fishing grounds will be restored,” Brenna said. SMOTHERED CORALS Falling ash can also smother coral reefs, which in Tonga are the mainstay of a tourism industry that brought in up to $5 million per year before the coronavirus pandemic. Even before the eruption, Tonga’s reefs were threatened by disease outbreaks and the effects of climate change including coral bleaching and increasingly strong cyclones. Now, “vast areas of the reefs in the immediate impact area at Hunga Tonga are probably buried and smothered by large deposits of volcanic ash,” said Tom Schils, a marine biologist at the University of Guam who has studied volcanic eruptions and corals in the Northern Mariana Islands. Such eruptions also release more iron into the water, which can boost the growth of blue-green algae and sponges that further degrade reefs. Reefs may have to start over - a process that could take years, said Brian Zgliczynski, a coral reef ecologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. “Species more tolerant of poor water quality will arrive first,” while hard corals and fish would take longer to return, he said. ERODED COASTLINES A loss of coral reefs would also affect Tonga's ability to cope with rising waters and storm surges. This is a concern for Tonga, where climate change is driving the sea level to rise by about 6 millimeters (0.2 inches) per year — double the global average. In a 2015 report https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leanne-Fernandes/publication/317341776_National_marine_ecosystem_service_valuation_summary_Tonga/links/5bbe5828299bf1010178adac/National-marine-ecosystem-service-valuation-summary-Tonga.pdf, Tonga valued its natural storm buffers including coral reefs as well as coastal seagrasses and mangroves at some $11 million annually. With the latest eruption, a Tongan sea level gauge recorded a tsunami wave of 1.19 metres (nearly four feet) before it stopped reporting. Tsunamis are known to cause rapid coastal erosion. And before communication systems went down, videos revealed damage to manmade seawalls. “Coastal defences and reclaimed land could all be strongly impacted by the tsunami waves, leaving the islands more vulnerable,” Cronin said.

1/18/2022,"A winter storm brought heavy snow to southern Ontario on Monday, January 17, prompting the closure of several highways due to stalled vehicles, police said. Timelapse footage filmed by Toronto resident Trey Geiger shows snow submerging a vehicle and the accumulation on his back deck, he said. “Check out the tree branches sagging under the weight of the snow!” he wrote in a tweet. Up to 60 centimeters (23.6 inches) of snowfall was expected in Toronto and its surrounding areas, according to Environment and Climate Change Canada. Local reports said 38 cm (14.9 inches) had fallen in downtown Toronto, while 45 centimeters (17.7 inches) accumulated in North Etobicoke and Whitby.

1/18/2022,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — The governor of Mexico’s Morelos state claimed Monday his predecessor and the previous police chief negotiated with a drug gang. Gov. Cuauhtémoc Blanco had himself been forced to deny any drug links earlier this month after a 3-year-old photo surfaced showing him posing with three men identified as local drug gang leaders. But Blanco went on the offensive Monday, claiming ex-governor Graco Ramirez had made deals with a gang known as “The Reds.” Blanco appeared at prosecutors' offices to ask they investigate any allegations against him, saying “I have nothing to hide, I don't make deals with criminals.” Blanco also accused the former state police chief, Alberto Capella, of being in on the deals. Capella said that was a lie intended to divert attention from Blanco's own problems. In his Twitter account, Capella called Blanco “ignorant, corrupt and perverse,” and said that under Ramirez's 2012-2018 administration, police had combatted The Reds with vigor. Morelos, just south of Mexico City, was once known for its balmy climate, and as a quiet weekend getaway for Mexico City residents. But over the last two decades it has been plagued by kidnappings, extortion and killings. A former Mexican national soccer team star, Blanco won the governorship of Morelos in 2018 after retiring from soccer. A photo from October of that same year shows him smiling and locking arms with three men, one of whom is under arrest and another who was killed in prison. The third man is allegedly still alive and leading a gang called the “Tlahuica Command” that may have been involved in the 2019 killing of a community activist. The newspaper El Sol de Mexico says the photo was found on the telephone of another drug suspect. Blanco ascribed the photo to the dangers of being a former soccer star who would never deny a fan a photo op. “I have taken a lot of photos as a soccer player,” Blanco said. He recalled a time when he was seen in a photo along with a son of imprisoned drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, noting “I didn’t even know who he was, but because I’m such a good guy, I take photos with everyone.” Asked by reporters when and where the photo published this week was taken — it appears to be indoors, in an office or dining room — Blanco said “I don’t know, I swear, I don’t even remember.” “I take a lot of photos (with people), and I am not going to be asking them, ‘hey, who are you and what do you do for a living?’” Blanco said. “I am going to continue taking photos,” Blanco said defiantly. “Perhaps more will come out.” Blanco previously served as mayor of the state capital, Cuernavaca. During his professional soccer career he was known for his pugnacious, combative style. As governor, Blanco has been criticized for naming former soccer associates to state posts.",World/Associated Press,Mexican governor says predecessor made deals with gangs,https://news.yahoo.com/mexican-governor-says-predecessor-made-234715203.html
1/18/2022,"A Kentucky candle factory that was destroyed by a killer tornado — and where workers said they were threatened with dismissal if they left their posts before it hit — is closing and half the employees are being laid off. Mayfield Consumer Products said in a Jan. 10 filing under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act that it plans to shift the remaining 250 or so workers to a new plant in the nearby town of Hickory that will be ""up and running as soon as practical."" ""Although many employees are being offered a transfer to the HP facility, there will not be room for the entire population to move to Hickory Point,"" plant manager Michael Staten said in the notice. ""Those employees not offered a transfer to the new facility will be laid off.""He said the company expects ""all layoffs in Mayfield to be permanent."" Company spokesman Bob Ferguson later told The Louisville Courier Journal, which first broke the news about the layoffs, that the company is ""committed to the rehiring of everyone and to meeting or exceeding the employment levels it had prior to the tornado.” ""We hope they all come back,"" he said. At least nine people were killed Dec. 10 when the twister ripped through Mayfield and flattened the factory while more than 100 workers were still inside making scented candles. One of the dead was a deputy jailer who was supervising a group of inmates who were employed at the factory as part of a work release program. Five workers said in interviews with NBC News that fearing for their safety, they pleaded with their bosses to allow them to leave and shelter at home. In an interview from her hospital bed, McKayla Emery, 21, said that worried workers first asked to leave shortly after tornado sirens sounded outside the factory around 5:30 p.m. “If you leave, you’re more than likely to be fired,” she said she overheard managers tell four workers standing near her who wanted to leave. “I heard that with my own ears.” Another Mayfield worker, 20-year-old Elijah Johnson, echoed Emery in an interview. “I asked to leave and they told me I’d be fired,” Johnson said. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced the state was launching an investigation shortly after the NBC News report appeared. “Everyone is expected to live up to certain standards of both the law, of safety and of being decent human beings,” he said. “I hope everybody lived up to those standards.” Ferguson denied the allegations. But since then, several survivors have sued the company, accusing it of showing a “flagrant indifference” to workers’ safety.",Business/NBC News,Kentucky candle factory that threatened to fire workers during tornado is closing,https://news.yahoo.com/kentucky-candle-factory-destroyed-deadly-171314760.html
