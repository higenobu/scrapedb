2/26/2022,"Gender fluidity is not just Harry Styles in a feather boa. It can also be a woman in an elegantly oversized double-breasted trouser suit, like the model who opened Gucci’s first Milan fashion week show in two years.“Seven years ago I designed a menswear collection, and everyone told me I had invented gender fluidity,” shrugged designer Alessandro Michele backstage. “I was like, my definition of masculinity is broad, OK?” (Funny, now, to recall the furore caused by a man in a pussy bow blouse, as recently as 2015.)Michele knows perfectly well that he did not, in fact, invent gender fluidity. “I am between two genders,” he said on Friday. “I was a special child. This is what I am, and I am voicing my own experience. Gender fluidity has become a marketing slogan, but I don’t want that.” This collection celebrated the quieter beauty of women in menswear, rather the rule-breaking energy of men in dresses. Most of the 84 models, whatever gender, wore trouser suits.In other words Gucci, best known recently for putting men in feminine clothes, dressed women in masculine clothes in a menswear-based collection shown during womenswear fashion week on models of all genders. Surprising an audience with a tradition-disrupting gender-fluid look is as on-brand for modern Gucci as supermodels in cocaine-white dresses slashed at the hipbone sashaying down a mirrored runway were in a previous era of glory days, under Tom Ford. Gucci – the world’s second most powerful fashion brand after Balenciaga, according to a recent Lyst report tracking sales, social media and search data – is not overly concerned with gatekeeping the traditions of what men and women wear. “I really like men’s suits,” said Michele. “As a child I remember always feeling really impressed by them. Not just on men – I grew up in the 1980s around working women, and they wore them too.” The women in his design team love menswear. “They will say, I love this jacket because the line is so neat, it’s like a man’s.”There was a clarity and simplicity to this show which allowed Michele’s charm and sincerity – which in some seasons has been at risk of disappearing under all the glittery turbans and jumbo pearl buttons – to shine through. The designer said of the return to physical shows in Italy that “it is beautiful to be home. It was so great to work with music and light and space again. Although spending so much time with lots of other people, I find this is very tiring”. The show was also a reveal for a collaboration with Adidas. Double-breasted corduroy suits with a Gucci-adapted trefoil logo on the breast pocket, bespoke Gazelle trainers and triple stripes were reminiscent of the kooky elegance of Adidas tracksuits in Wes Anderson’s cult 2001 film, The Royal Tenenbaums. Michele remarked that “fashion has left the atelier”, and credited Adidas with “bringing elegance into sportswear”, although he was at pains to point out that Gucci’s history with its iconic red-green-red stripe has a heritage traced to the Palio horse race in Siena, which dates to the 13th century.",Lifestyle/Fashion,A quieter gender fluidity marks Gucci’s return to the Milan runway,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/feb/25/a-quieter-gender-fluidity-marks-guccis-return-to-the-milan-runway
2/26/2022,"Until this week, it had been 12 years since Law & Order, the crime procedural that spawned a world of spinoffs and entrenched the perspective of police and prosecutors on television, aired a new episode. A lot has changed since the flagship show, which premiered on NBC in 1990 and returned to the network for its 21st season on Thursday, went on hiatus in 2010. (For one, the 20th season finale was about a menacing blog.) Crime procedurals – shows in which law enforcement solve a case over the course of a single episode – remain popular; they composed six of the top 10 most-watched scripted broadcast shows in 2020. Law & Order’s most successful spinoff, Special Victims Unit, is now the longest-running live-action primetime series in history with 23 seasons. But a decade’s worth of video evidence of racist police brutality, particularly against Black Americans, has put TV shows where police are always the protagonists under fair scrutiny. Given the gaping discrepancy between the fantasy of policing on-screen and the inequitable, often racist, highly fallible institutions off it, some have called for the end of crime procedurals altogether. That was always unlikely; crime procedurals are enduringly popular and often entertaining. Law & Order’s consistencies – the two-part structure, the suits, the unforgettable dun-dun, the light sexual tension, the professionalism, the endurance of format over cast – is familiar, comforting and addictive; anyone who has ever turned on a L&O marathon and found themselves still on the couch five hours later can vouch for this, myself included. But the return of its flagship series marks another notch in the franchise’s ongoing identity crisis, and begs several questions. How can a franchise which has always seen law enforcement as the flawed good guys adapt to the times and the responsibility of its influence? Can the reboot of arguably the most iconic and influential crime procedural of them all justify its existence in 2022? Shows such as Law & Order, created by super-producer Dick Wolf, have played an outsized role in sanitizing police work, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and establishing false narratives about the efficacy and fairness of the criminal justice system. For instance, the ironclad structure of Law & Order – cops find a suspect, then district attorneys work to convict them – suggest that defendants almost always get a trial. In reality, most criminal defendants (according to the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, 97% of criminal cases), especially people of color, are pressed into often discriminatory plea deals. The show is also a bedrock of crime procedurals which promote fantasies of hyper-competence, in which law enforcement are almost uniformly the heroes solving crimes at far above the national average, and in which all uses of force or bending of the rules is justified. The Law & Order franchise has long had an issue with the popular SVU character Elliot Stabler (Christoper Meloni), the archetypical “ends justify the means” hothead cop whose return to SVU last year launched his own spinoff, Law & Order: Organized Crime. Stabler’s return prompted gentle critiques from new superiors (his record includes six shooting deaths!) but Organized Crime has doubled down on Stabler as a crusading, outside-the-lines cop fighting a seedy criminal underbelly in New York. The new flagship Law & Order, also a Wolf creation, seems more interested in addressing heightened scrutiny for its role in glamorizing law enforcement than its siblings. Early in the 21st season premiere, Detective Frank Cosgrove (Jeffrey Donovan), a white cop, gets rebuffed by a black teenager whom he’s trying to question in public. Agitated, Cosgrove causes a scene, and a crowd of onlookers immediately whip out their cellphones to start filming. Cosgrove gets flustered. “I’m white, he’s black, if I say the wrong thing I lose my job!” he tells his partner, Detective Kevin Bernard (Law & Order veteran Anthony Anderson), who is a black man. Bernard, who in the previous season finale is self-assured to the point of smug, isn’t sympathetic: “Maybe you should’ve treated him a little more polite, like a law-abiding citizen minding his own goddamn business,” he retorts. This dialogue, like much of the premiere episode (no others were made available in advance), is heavy-handed, to say the least, but it’s still a step forward. It’s an in-show rebuke of tradition for a show whose moments of snappy humor often relied on contempt toward those accused of committing a crime – or, depending on the cop, anyone who came under suspicion at all. The main story, in Law & Order tradition, is ripped from the headlines. The episode centers around the murder of a Bill Cosby figure – a well-known black entertainer accused of drugging and raping over 40 women – released from prison on a prosecutorial error. #MeToo protesters circle the courthouse and fill the trial of a victim accused of shooting him to protect other women. The plot line is uncomfortable and confusing; the show introduces a surprising amount of ambiguity (you can supply plenty of outside discomfort with curdled social media movements) but then wraps it tidily in a pat and hyper-competent closing argument by assistant district attorney Samantha Maroun (Odelya Halevi). You can make bones about lines like Bernard’s line “first time in 20 years people actually care about a Black man getting shot” or its handling of a rape victim pushed to vengeance. (I have issues with both.) But these concerns were less interesting to me than the implications of mistakes at several turns, and the fallibility of policing tactics once lionized for toughness. In the interrogation of a prime suspect, Cosgrove blatantly lies about immunity to prompt a confession, a manipulation of a rape survivor that’s upsetting both to the audience and to Bernard, who grimaces but does not stop it. District attorney Nolan Price (Hugh Dancy), the idealistic upstart to Sam Waterston’s beloved veteran Jack McCoy, does stop it; he tosses the confession on the basis of impermissible questioning. “Cops are allowed to lie,” McCoy, skeptical of Price’s decision to hamper his own case, tells him. “They are!” Price responds, “but it makes the confession less reliable, less ethical.” To be clear: Law & Order has not solved its fundamental bias. Price is, ultimately, the good guy trying to do right within the system. But it’s a thornier conversation about a knot of optics and ethics – and a straightforward acknowledgement that the rules don’t make it right, that police business as usual can unfairly exploit – than many crime shows allow. This is not an endorsement of the law enforcement perspective on-screen, as entertaining as it can be (and the premiere of Law & Order 2.0 locked me on the couch). But if we’re going to have crime procedurals on TV – and they’re profitable and reliable enough that we’re going to, for now – it’s worth thinking about how they redraw the lines, what shades of grey they incorporate, the contours of their considerable influence. The new Law & Order could go the way of Organized Crime, but its premiere suggests a more thoughtful, considered, meatier approach to depicting “the criminal justice system”, one that could be and has been worse.",Arts/Television & radio,What can the return of Law & Order offer in 2022?,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/25/law-and-order-reboot
2/26/2022,"The Capitol rioter who was pictured carrying Nancy Pelosi’s lectern and bragged he had “broken the internet” in doing so has been sentenced to 75 days in prison and a $5,000 fine. Adam Johnson, 37 and from Florida, was photographed carrying the podium on 6 January 2021. He and other supporters of Donald Trump stormed Congress in an attempt to stop certification of Joe Biden’s electoral victory, in service of Trump’s lie that his defeat was the result of electoral fraud. More than 700 have been charged over the riot, 11 with seditious conspiracy. Trump was impeached but acquitted. He and his aides are the subject of an investigation by a House select committee. One aide, Steve Bannon, has pleaded not guilty to criminal contempt of Congress, a charge that carries jail time. Johnson will spend time in jail, having pleaded guilty to entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds. The US Department of Justice requested 90 days’ imprisonment. It also noted, in itemising Johnson’s activities on 6 January 2021, that he “witnessed rioters attempt to break down the doors to the House chamber and encouraged them to do so by shouting that a bust of George Washington would make ‘a great battering ram’”. In court on Friday, assistant US attorney Jessica Arco said: “Mr Johnson was part of a mob. He knew that.” Lawyers for Johnson said of his viral photograph: “Unfortunately, he received considerable attention simply because the lectern belonged to Speaker of the House. Arguably, if he latched on to some other piece of government furniture for his photo opportunity jail time would not even be a consideration.” The judge, Reggie B Walton, disagreed. “We’re on a dangerous slide in America,” he said, calling January 6 something he would ordinarily expect to see in “banana republics”. Johnson said he was ashamed, and suggested that if he had acted as he did in other countries he might have ended up in front of a firing squad “instead of [in] a courtroom”. He also said he never intended to hurt Pelosi and said: “If I did find her, I would ask for a selfie with her, if anything.”",News/US news,January 6 rioter who carried Nancy Pelosi’s podium fined and sentenced,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/25/january-6-rioter-nancy-pelosi-podium-sentenced
2/26/2022,"The Duke of Sussex received “insufficient information” about a decision to change his taxpayer-funded police protection when he is in the UK, the high court has heard. Prince Harry has brought a legal challenge against the Home Office after being told he would not be given the “same degree” of personal protective security when visiting the UK from the US – despite him offering to pay for it himself. The court was previously told that the prince would not feel safe when visiting the UK with his family under current security arrangements. Harry is challenging the decision made by the executive committee for the protection of royalty and public figures (Ravec) from February 2020, which has delegated powers from the Home Office. The argument being made by the prince’s legal team is that his private protection team in the US does not have adequate jurisdiction abroad or access to UK intelligence information which is needed to keep his family safe. At the first hearing for the case occurred on Friday, Harry was not present. Although the preliminary proceedings were largely held in private, during an initial public part of the hearing, the judge, Justice Smith, summarised the four grounds forming the basis of the prince’s legal argument. He said these included an alleged “over rigid application of the policy” and a “failure” to take into account “relevant considerations”. The grounds also claim that conclusions reached were “unreasonable” and that “insufficient information” was provided in relation to the Ravec policy and “those involved in the Ravec decision”, the judge said. Shaheed Fatima QC, who is representing Harry, provided the judge with two letters “on the membership of Ravec”. She told the court that “we’ve been asking about the membership”, later adding that this would relate to “the relevance of the claimant’s knowledge about who he was dealing with and in what capacity”. A legal representative for Prince Harry previously said he wanted to fund the security himself, rather than ask taxpayers to foot the bill. In written submissions, Robert Palmer QC, representing the Home Office, argued that Harry’s offer to pay for his own security was “irrelevant” and that “personal protective security by the police is not available on a privately financed basis”. The Home Office’s written arguments also claim that the prince’s offer of funding was “notably not advanced to Ravec” at the time of Harry’s visit in June 2021, or in any pre-action discussions. Justice Swift is expected to give his ruling on the initial court proceedings, part of which may be confidential, at a later date.",News/UK news,"Prince Harry not given enough information when police protection pulled, court told",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/25/prince-harry-not-given-enough-information-when-police-protection-pulled-court-told
2/26/2022,"Thomas Frank has confirmed Christian Eriksen will make his Brentford debut in Saturday’s crucial match against Newcastle, completing an emotional return to football for the Denmark international eight months after his cardiac arrest at Euro 2020. Last month Eriksen joined the Bees on a contract until the end of the season, having departed Internazionale in December. Brentford have been keen not to rush him back but he has played two friendlies, making two assists in the secondagainst a Rangers XI, and Frank is convinced the 30-year-old is in good shape to return. Eriksen is expected to appear from the bench during the second half. “Christian will be in the squad, he will get on the pitch for his debut tomorrow, it will be amazing,” he said. “It is a big day for all of us, but especially Christian and his family. Everyone saw what happened [last summer] and it is another reminder that we are privileged to do what we do, so we need to appreciate every moment.” Eriksen has been fitted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and Frank explained it would provide security for the player, who aims to return to Denmark’s squad for the World Cup. “The key thing is that everything has been checked, it is all good with zero chance that something should happen,” Frank said. “He and his family are aligned that he should play football, which is very important.” Frank cautioned that it could take three or four games for Eriksen to regain full sharpness but expressed contentment with the player’s physical adaptation. “When he went into team training with high intensity his body reacted well, which means he’s in a good place,” he said. “Then it was just about timing, tempo, intensity, a lot of players around him, taking the right decisions. He was getting a bit better week by week by week. Now he needs to get that intuitive feeling, decision-making, back that you need at the highest level. “We will need a few games to get him going under max, but I would not put him in there if I didn’t think he could provide something now.” Brentford will be staring a relegation battle in the face if they lose against Eddie Howe’s side, who are three places and two points below in 17th but have two games in hand, and Frank hopes the 109-times capped Eriksen can boost them with his experience. “There is no doubt he is the player with the biggest CV who has ever played for Brentford,” he said. “You can see it mainly in his quality. When you see him training, it is remarkable the things he has been doing. There is also all of his experience, small conversations with players over where you want the ball when you give it to others [and] when they should be cool on the pitch.” Brentford have only taken one point from their past seven games but expect to welcome back Ivan Toney, their centre-forward, from injury to face his former club.",Sport/Football,‘A big day’: Eriksen set to make comeback for Brentford against Newcastle,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/25/christian-eriksen-comeback-for-brentford-against-newcastle
2/26/2022,"Global markets staged a major recovery on Friday in a sign that traders believed the sanctions imposed on Russia were unlikely to significantly affect western economies. The FTSE 100 closed up 3.9%, rebounding from an almost 4% drop the previous day after Moscow invaded Ukraine, but still ending the week in the red. Similar rises were seen on France and Germany’s exchanges, while the Russian stock market, which fell 33% on Thursday, ended Friday up 20%. The FTSE 250 index ticked up by 3.2% and, in the US, the benchmark S&P 500 gained in early trading. The FTSE 100’s rebound was propelled by investors’ response to sanctions imposed on Russia, which were less stringent than many expected, and an influx of bargain-hunters buying the dip. “It’s quite an impressive rebound,” said Seema Shah, the chief global strategist at Principal Global Investors. “The market is responding to the idea that sanctions at this stage are not interrupting energy supply.” Prices for a barrel of Brent crude – the international benchmark for oil – dropped below $94 on Friday from highs on Thursday of over $101, making many investors fear a prolonged rise in energy prices. Meanwhile, UK petrol prices on Thursday hit a record high of almost 150p a litre, with further rises expected. The average price of unleaded petrol climbed to 149.67p and diesel rose to 153.05p on Thursday, according to RAC data from roughly 7,500 UK petrol forecourts – both record highs. The petrol price jump is a further burden for the UK public amid an already crushing cost-of-living crisis, with inflation at 5.5% in January – its highest rate for almost 30 years. “Sadly, more increases are on the way,” said Simon Williams, RAC’s fuel spokesperson, who expects the price to vault 150p a litre “early next week”. “This is the worst possible combination for drivers as it will push already rising prices higher still and worsen the cost-of-living crisis,” Williams said. Despite Friday’s gains, market volatility looked set to thunder on, Shah said, driven by uncertainty about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “It’s very difficult with any geopolitical crisis, but particularly with this one, to understand how it’s going to play out or how long it’s going to go on for,” she said. “So for anyone to call yesterday the bottom, I think it’s a bit premature.”",News/Business,Global markets surge as concerns ease over effect of sanctions on the west,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/25/global-markets-surge-as-concerns-ease-over-effect-of-sanctions-on-the-west
2/26/2022,"“Every new coach wants to be high press, high energy, win the ball back, play quickly, all that stuff, there’s nothing new in that,” Frank Lampard scoffed to Gary Neville last year, in one of the many media interviews he gave during his extended break from management. And he was right, of course. Pretty much every young manager who emerges off the Uefa Pro Licence course seems to have the same few stock phrases to hand: a broad-brush managerial philosophy that is so vague as to be essentially meaningless. Late last month Lampard finally made his return to management at Everton, and in his first press conference outlined the way he wanted his new team to play. “When I think of Everton, it’s a team that loves to see crosses and pressure and second balls, shots and combinations and things done at speed, a team that wants to run and a team that wants to press high up the pitch,” he said. “Those things absolutely align with my philosophy.” A textbook sales pitch. Of course, as Lampard well knows, the devil of coaching is not in the theory but in the practice, and thus far it’s fair to say the practice has been mixed: two convincing home wins and two convincing away defeats. By the time Everton play on Saturday evening, they could be in the Premier League relegation zone for the first time since Marco Silva was sacked more than two years ago. Their opponents? Manchester City. “Enjoy the ball,” Lampard was heard urging his players during one of his first training sessions, and a key early focus has been on converting a scarred, scared Everton squad into a team comfortable in possession. The arrivals of Donny van de Beek and Dele Alli are a clear attempt to augment the level of technical ability in midfield. Everton’s ball retention under Rafa Benítez was one of the worst in the Premier League. But in truth the decline had begun to set in even earlier than that. Under Roberto Martínez and Ronald Koeman, Everton were habitually among the top eight Premier League teams in terms of possession. Ever since Koeman’s sacking, a clear trend has emerged. Possession fell under Sam Allardyce (even if results improved slightly), rose briefly under Silva, fell again under Carlo Ancelotti and then fell away almost entirely under Benítez. This feels not so much like a blip as a cultural shift, habits that have been unlearned and rewired over years rather than months, an entire football club that seems to have forgotten how to pass the ball. Everton have appointed Kevin Thelwell as their new director of football. The 48-year-old joins from New York Red Bulls, where he was head of sport, and was previously sporting director at Wolves. He replaces Marcel Brands, who left the relegation-threatened club in December. Andy Hunter Take Tom Davies, one of the few constants in a rapidly-changing Everton squad over the last few years. In 2018-19, the season after he turned 20, he was an integral part of an attacking passing-based team, with stats to match. Three years on, those numbers have plummeted. Average passes per 90 minutes are down from 48 to 33. Successful long balls down from 5.2 to 1.7. Passes into the final third down from 4.5 to 1.1. The same player, at the same club, in what should have been the prime learning years of his career. Instead, due to a combination of poor luck with injuries, poor planning and a poorly-defined team identity, it’s hard to know where he goes from here. André Gomes is a similar story, a midfielder of promise whose career seems to have gone gently into reverse from the moment he set foot at Goodison. It’s easy enough to point the blame at individual players for underperforming, but when they are so clearly part of a broader long-term pattern it’s hard not to conclude that the failure is systemic. The question is whether Lampard is capable of reversing any of this, or whether – in common with his time at Derby and Chelsea – he will shift the spotlight on to his players when results start to turn. “We stopped trying to play,” he complained after the defeat by Southampton. “When the game turned we reverted to type and lacked belief.” Which is all very well when you’ve only been in the job for a few weeks. But there comes a point when this kind of becomes your responsibility. At the heart of this project, then, lie a number of unknowns. What really defines Lampard’s managerial philosophy beyond a set of handy buzz-phrases and a vague idea of progressive football? How realistic is it to impose a radical style change in the middle of a relegation scrap? And – most pertinently of all – what constitutes success here? Is it really enough for Lampard to steer Everton to 17th place? Or should the league’s seventh-most expensive squad be held to a higher standard? Part of the reason this is such a gamble on Everton’s part is that we have no real way of assessing Lampard’s ability to effect genuine change. He inherited good squads from Gary Rowett at Derby and Maurizio Sarri at Chelsea, and each time performed reasonably well for one season without ever really changing much. Everton is a different challenge entirely: a dysfunctional club that requires more than a positive attitude and some choice phrases. It requires an identity beyond “high energy and high pressing”, an aspiration that goes further than simply wanting to be a big club again, a sense of wider purpose beyond positioning its celebrity manager for his next job. Above all, it needs time and a vision. At this admittedly early stage, it is not entirely clear whether Lampard has either.",Sport/Football,Lampard cannot pass buck as possession-shy Everton flirt with relegation places | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/25/frank-lampard-possession-shy-everton-flirt-relegation-places
2/26/2022,"New Zealand’s anti-vaccine convoy is hoping to be there for the long haul. Once a ragtag collective of tents, it has become a fully fledged encampment: it has free clothing tents, admin checkpoints, yellow-vested security guards, portable toilets, tents for charging phones, and a “blues lounge” where the band plays a light, jazzy reimagining of Pink Floyd’s Brick in the Wall. “We don’t need no vaccination, we don’t need no thought control,” a woman croons, tapping the bongos. On the surface, the occupation of parliamentary grounds evokes a poorly planned but amiable music festival, but an undercurrent of violence – or its threat – throbs below. As well as chalked messages of peace and love, some protesters came bearing nooses, promises of a “war crimes trial” for politicians, journalists, and scientists, or outright demands to “hang them high”. On Wednesday, a man was arrested after driving a car directly at police lines. Police allege protesters have thrown faecal matter and acid over officers [some protesters say this never happened, or was a false flag operation to discredit them]. Despite the encampment’s commitment to being alcohol free, at least one fight has broken out between intoxicated campers. There have also been credible reports of police brutality, with one demonstrator alleging an officer gouged his eyes. New Zealand has endured most of the pandemic with little experience of the death, mass unemployment, political incompetence or furious partisan infighting that has plagued other countries. Its pandemic response has been characterised by remarkable levels of social cohesion and consensus. Support for pandemic measures – including highly restrictive ones like lockdowns and border closures – have often polled at more than 80%. New Zealanders’ trust in scientists and one another rose during Covid-19, to become the highest in the world. The convoy of furious citizens that have arrived on parliament lawns are the most confronting splintering of that vision. They are an uncomfortable reminder that even as much of the country has come to trust its leaders, scientists and fellow citizens, a vocal minority have come to opposite conclusions. As the occupation continues, researchers fear that it has become a radicalisation device, and a recruiting ground for extremist groups. “This is world war three,” says Angela*, taking a large bite of avocado salad. A chatty, retired kindergarten teacher from Mangawhai, she believes New Zealand’s political parties are involved in a plot to use vaccines to thin the population, and will eventually face consequences for their crimes. “It’s much more serious – well, not more serious, but a different kind of war from the first world war or second world war. It’s basically a depopulation agenda.” She is reluctant to say whether prime minister Jacinda Ardern or other government officials should be executed, as she doesn’t like the idea of people dying. “But when the truth comes out, then they will have to be dealt with,” she says. For some protesters, distrust of the government has long roots. Alex* is manning the protest frontlines, standing with an enormous black motorbike behind the concrete bollards installed by police. At his feet is a large dog, whom he introduces as Jaws. Alex says that his brother in-law suffered a heart attack in the weeks after his booster shot. “The trauma of that and the damage of that is still resounding within our family,” he says. Data indicates heart problems are far more common as a result of Covid-19 infection than of vaccination, but Alex saw the booster and heart attack as connected. He believes Covid-19 was released deliberately, as part of a “plandemic” to enable millionaires, pharmaceutical companies, and world leaders to control the global population. Alex is from Ngati Maahanga, Waikato, where the crown committed atrocities and confiscated more than 485,000 hectares (1.2m acres) of land in the mid-1800s. Indigenous people have plentiful historical reasons not to trust state promises of protection. That history flows through to the present, Alex says, where Māori make up a significant portion of protesters today. Those calling for trials and executions, Alex says, don’t represent the majority. “When it comes to those who make extreme claims about retribution and stuff like that – those people have a belief of their own, that [it’s] the only way to get justice for the injustices they feel have been perpetrated against them,” he says. “That is solely and completely their own narrative. … We are definitely not about that. What we want is the mandates dropped.” Many say their views have been misrepresented – that heavy-handed views like a “Nuremberg 2.0” trial are a small minority, not reflective of the wider group. But on Thursday night, the protesters conducted some – admittedly unscientific – internal polling of their own. In a poll posted in the protesters’ internal Telegram group, they asked “Should all members of parliament & media face crimes against humanity charges?” About 1,400 participated. Ninety-four per cent voted yes. Asked more specifically about civil uprisings, the vote was split – around half voted for “only peaceful” disobedience, and around half for uprisings. On encrypted messaging apps, more extreme views surface. Some supporters compiled lists of names – politicians, prominent scientists, journalists – who were due for trial for crimes against humanity. Others ridiculed those calling for peaceful demonstrations. “The banners should be saying: hang the traitors. Hang Jacinda. Hang the demon midget [Covid-19 response minister Chris] Hipkins. Hang these people,” one participant said in a series of voice messages broadcast to the group. Some researchers fear that the protests and their attendant online groups are acting as a whirlpool of radicalisation, and a recruiting ground for extremist or far-right groups. As well as those who are simply vaccine-hesitant or anti-mandate, they say the protests have been infiltrated by darker ideas: antisemitism, misogyny, neo-fascism and calls for violence. The moderate or curious turn up, and can be exposed to increasingly extreme discussions. “It’s what you call total immersion,” says Dr Sanjana Hattotuwa, an extremism specialist at research centre Te Pūnaha Matatini. “It actually isn’t any different to learning a language. The best way to learn a language is to put yourself in and try to navigate a context or environment where you don’t speak the language, where you’re forced to learn it in order to just basically get out and move around,” he says. “The same applies when you’re surrounded by conspiratorialism.” Lisa*, a softly-spoken 67-year-old, opted not to get the vaccine as she does not believe in pharmaceuticals, she says, and came to the protests because she believes vaccine mandates are “inhumane”. Since turning up, however, she has heard many more conspiratorial ideas. “There are so many rabbit holes. I listen to the rabbit holes, and some of them scare me deeply,” she says. “Because they make so much logical sense.” Lisa says that over her time at the protest, her own perspective has shifted, as she has been exposed to the theories of others. She is increasingly convinced that there are wider things at play. “These people have been researching and thinking about this for quite some period of time,” she says. “I hear really wacky things. But it’s like, some of them just resonate.” More moderate arrivals at the protest, Hattotuwa says, are plunged into an environment thick with ideas that would otherwise be fringe. Over time, the group can concentrate, like a solution boiling down: moderate attenders start to peel off, and the core that remains can harden, build solidarity, and feel increasingly alienated. The trajectory of these groups is not always predictable, Hattotuwa says, but they tend to veer increasingly extreme. The extremism-monitoring project he works on has recorded an explosion of conspiracy theories and extremist rhetoric online, with sharing and engagement of misinformation vastly eclipsing the flow of information from reliable sources. “Looking at every measurable day on day … nothing indicates or suggests, or gives an iota of hope that the moderates or moderate viewpoints, or a shared reality is winning out.” Hattotuwa, originally from Sri Lanka, says he sees worrying trends that remind him of fissures in his home country. New Zealand being a high-trust society, he says “is not an inoculation” against extremism or misinformation. “High trust does not mean that you have a greater handle on truth.” If New Zealand’s convoy protest ends, it is likely to be by attrition. Police have established a strictly enforced border: cars can leave, but not enter. Protesters on social media reported exhaustion, tension, malaise, and mild skin rashes. Many blamed the symptoms on an electric wave weapon, rather than side-effects of 15 days in a sodden, crowded campsite. On the main stage, an organiser entreats the crowd to stamp out bad behaviour toward police, abuse of passersby, and splintering into factions. “It can’t continue,” he says. “I’ll tell you this – if it does continue and you don’t start cleaning up the fringes, you’re going to have Wellington against you, and you’re going to have the people of New Zealand against you.” In the straw in front of him, a discarded, contextless piece of signage with the words “Neo-Nazi???” drifts across the ground. *Names have been changed",News/World news,"‘So many rabbit holes’: Even in trusting New Zealand, protests show fringe beliefs can flourish",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/so-many-rabbit-holes-even-in-trusting-new-zealand-protests-show-fringe-beliefs-can-flourish
2/26/2022,"The missile left a crater two metres deep, twisted shards of metal beside a playground slide, and shattered glass below the windows of a nearby kindergarten. Dozens of homes were scorched or shredded, their inhabitants turned into some of Kyiv’s first war refugees. In one apartment block 10 floors of kitchens, living rooms and bedrooms sat open to the skies, their balconies, doors and windows broken off or shattered into pieces by the weapon that brought the Russian invasion to this corner of the city. The missile hit soon after 4am on Friday, before Russian troops reached the city outskirts, or Ukrainian troops set up defensive positions in its historic centre. “People are grieving. This is already a tragedy,” said Gorban Abasov, a 70-year-old singer. Most of the people who lived there were pensioners like him, he said, none had army links and nearby buildings were civilian as well. There was no reason for a such a lethal weapon to land here, but none of those gathered to inspect the damage seemed surprised that civilians were already in the line of fire, even before the battle for Kyiv had really begun. After all, there was no reason for Russian troops to be in their country, beyond the terrifying whim of an ageing autocrat. As Abasov stared at the ruins of his home, Ukrainian soldiers were already taking up position in Kyiv’s historic centre and its strategic bridges across the Dnieper and fighting advance Russian forces on its outskirts. While it is not yet clear what future Vladimir Putin envisages for Ukraine if his invasion succeeds, it is clear he wants to hold the capital and dismantle the government of Volodymyr Zelenskiy, which he attacked on Friday as a “gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis”. Zelenskiy, who is Jewish, has vowed to stay in the city to fight for it, despite offers of evacuation. On Friday evening he posted a video, filmed on the streets of the capital, showing him in military fatigues and standing with the prime minister and other key political leaders, proving he had not fled. “All of us here. We are defending our independence. And we will continue to do so. Glory to our male and female defenders. Glory to Ukraine.” Zelensky posts a video with top aides + his prime minister, apparently from above ground in Kyiv.“We are all here, our soldiers are here … we are defending our independence” pic.twitter.com/CX7s7Rq0ED The ex-president Petro Poroshenko, once a political rival now an ally against Russian aggression, also held a gun during a live television interview from the streets of the capital. City authorities had urged residents to stay home but prepare molotov cocktails for a citizen uprising against Russian fighters if they broke through defensive lines. In one district they handed out rifles to any citizen who wanted to fight and the defence ministry opened the army to any Ukrainian citizen. “Bring only your passport and social security number. There are no age restrictions,” the ministry said in a public post. The invitation to fight was taken up by so many Ukrainians of all ages and backgrounds that the recruiting office was overwhelmed. “They told us: ‘Come back tomorrow morning, we haven’t even eaten all day, have mercy on us,’” said Sergey, an Oxford-educated civil servant who tried to join the city defence force on Friday morning. The night before, Kyiv had been rife with rumours of an all-out assault to seize control of the streets and government buildings, capture or kill officials, and make way for a puppet government, fuelled by tweets from the US senator Marco Rubio. Many Kyivites spent the night in metro stations or bomb shelters because of these warnings, perhaps one reason why the missile strike caused so much damage but only injured four people. It was one of a series of blasts that shook the city awake soon after 4am; another was caused by a Russian plane that crashed into residential buildings. The wail of air raid warning sirens followed soon after, calling those not already underground to take shelter. The city’s mayor, the former world heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, said the city was in a “defence phase” and warned of undercover Russian “sabotage groups” in a briefing on Friday, but the assault had already got much further than that. There were gunfights reported in northern Obolon district and photos circulated of soldiers readying to defend Podil, a riverside port district that is home to a historic university and crammed with fashionable bars and restaurants that make it Kyiv’s answer to Brooklyn in New York or Shoreditch in London. The days-long fight for control of Hostomel airport on the city outskirts, which has a long runway that would allow Russia to land heavy transport planes, intensified. Elsewhere, in parts of the city where the war had not quite arrived, the streets were eerily empty, apart from long but calm queues outside pharmacies and supermarkets, as a remarkably stoic population stocked up for a possible siege. The city council asked citizens to stop livestreaming the streets and avoid posting pictures of soldiers and army positions, in case it aided Russian troops. Only the roads leading westward to relative safety were still crammed, as a last surge of refugees tried to escape the coming bloodshed. The caravan of cars, most packed with people, pets and possessions, often came to a complete halt as roads were overwhelmed by the flood of exiles. The railway station was also swamped with crowds desperate to escape. Guards fired warning shots at one point to prevent a stampede among hundreds of people who stormed carriages as they pulled in. Those who stayed took heart from news of Ukrainian forces’ success in many battles around the country, which apparently slowed plans to encircle Kyiv. British authorities said on Friday that most Russian troops were still more than 50km (30 miles) from the capital, and had opened a new advance towards Kyiv having failed to capture the city of Chernihiv, which they had hoped to use as a staging post. Videos also circulated on social media showing unarmed Ukrainians attempting to tackle the invaders, including one of a man stopping a convoy of armoured vehicles by running into the road and shouting at them. Another showed a woman shouting abuse at soldiers and telling them to put sunflower seeds in their pockets, so when they were killed on Ukrainian soil, flowers would grow from their corpses. But for all the mood of defiance, there was also a resignation to bloodshed ahead, in an all-out fight against an enemy whose tactics in other wars have included targeting civilians. Anatoly Grigovivch, 64, had defied the air raid sirens to race over to his daughter’s legal firm, which had been torn apart by the missile that exploded next to the apartment block. He was worried about looters. “I wouldn’t have minded if they hit that tax office,” he said, grimacing after climbing through what was once a glass door. “They just hit people with this missile, do you see any tanks here?”",News/World news,The battle for Kyiv: ‘People are grieving.

2/26/2022,"My friend Sarah Caton, who has died aged 51 of lung cancer, led the Association of Directors of Children’s Services, and its predecessor, for 19 years. A fearless and influential leader, she was a tireless advocate for children’s rights and children’s services, and although her work was unseen by the public, it was quite literally life changing. Born Sarah Brierley in Oldham, she attended Crompton House school, where she became head girl. A keen reader, she was the first in her family to go on to higher education, studying English literature at Oxford Polytechnic (now Oxford Brookes University) and graduating in 1993. She was elected as president of the student union before becoming head of student recruitment at her alma mater. There she met Dave Caton, and after getting married they returned north to support Sarah’s mother, who was receiving treatment for cancer. She worked as an administrative consultant for universities and higher education publishers and undertook a master’s in literature at the University of Salford. In 2001 Sarah became the first assistant general secretary of the Society of Education Officers, which later became the Association of Directors of Children’s Services (ADCS). Then, as chief officer, she helped to make the organisation into an influential and nationally respected voice for children’s services, supporting each of the 15 presidents of the Association who served while she was there – myself included - by building lasting friendships with us all. The value of Sarah’s guidance and support cannot be overstated; she brought important continuity to this work, and her connections were unrivalled. She was also a sounding board for senior government officials and policymakers across Whitehall. When she had to step aside due to her diagnosis of cancer in late 2021 she received a heartfelt letter from the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, recognising her contribution to children’s lives over the course of her career. Perhaps Sarah’s most enduring challenge was to try to help to find a better way of supporting vulnerable children who arrive in the UK alone as asylum seekers. Here she ensured the needs of children were never forgotten. and her personal relationship with ADCS members across the country helped to avert crisis after crisis on the south coast as the numbers of arrivals peaked during the summer months. During the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic she also worked to secure free school meals and laptops for vulnerable children and young people. Sarah always worked very hard and had a no-nonsense approach, but she had a great zest for life, a big smile, and an ability to outlast everyone at the bar. Her marriage to Dave ended in divorce in 2011. She is survived by her brother, Kevin, and sister, Emma.",News/Society,Sarah Caton obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/25/sarah-caton-obituary

2/26/2022,"Within minutes of the first explosions, Ukraine’s great exodus began. Some had been planning for a Russian invasion for months. They had carefully filled the car with petrol, bought food supplies and packed a getaway bag, just in case. And, in many cases, a carrier for much-loved family pets. Others had done nothing whatsoever. Until Russia’s blitzkrieg invasion began early on Thursday, many people in Kyiv believed the prospect fanciful. And yet the nightmare was real enough: air raid sirens, Russian helicopters flying low against a grey sky in attack formation, the roar of enemy warplanes. By Friday, as Russian forces approached Kyiv from the north-west, Ukraine responded in two ways. One was by fighting. Its protagonists were soldiers, military veterans, volunteers. Members of the Ukrainian forces tried to hold back a powerful enemy advancing on multiple fronts: from the east and Russia; the south and Crimea; the north and Belarus. The other, bigger group were civilians fleeing the surging conflict – a great, wheeled caravan that filled the road west out of the city, and continued for dozens of miles. For hours this procession of cars scarcely moved. Drivers emerged to stretch their legs. It was unprecedented: Ukraine’s biggest ever jam. Those without vehicles had to find other options. There were long queues at Kyiv-Pasazhyrskyi railway station. Some trains were cancelled but a few, remarkably, were running, albeit delayed by five or six hours. Military transport took priority, railway staff explained. Buying a ticket was almost impossible in a panicked city of 3 million people. Some set off on foot, walking along the verge of the E40 road in the early hours of Friday morning, pulling carry-on cases. One departed on a mountain bike. On the day of invasion the Ukrainian government introduced a 10pm-7am curfew. Trains on the Soviet-built Kyiv metro stopped promptly. The underground stations remained open all night, now serving as bomb shelters. “We left at 5.30am when we heard the first explosions,” Vera Ivanovna said, wiping away tears. “I didn’t bring any clothes. I took my mother, nine-year-old daughter and sister.” Ivanovna said she had been driving for 28 hours, after setting off from her home in Sumy, in north-eastern Ukraine, close to the city of Kharkiv and the Russian border. Kremlin tanks had now taken over Sumy, she said, after heavy fighting. “My husband is there. He can’t leave. There are Russian checkpoints now.” She added: “My daughter was due to fly to Egypt. She had packed a bag with a swimsuit in it. We were successful people. We owned a business and an apartment block. Now it’s gone.” Ivanovna said she would drop her sister off at the Polish border and stay with friends in the western city of Lviv. The Polish government was allowing women to enter the country without documents or visas. But Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, banned men of conscription age, between 18 and 60, from exiting Ukraine. There were heart-rending farewells. Along the road out of Kyiv, cars queued in vast curving lines to buy petrol. One driver, Dima, said he had fled his home in the city of Vyshhorod, north of the capital, after seeing Russian helicopters in the sky. “There were 30 of them. They flew over us,” he said. The paratroopers on board tried to seize nearby Hostomel airport. What would happen to Kyiv? “It’s kaput,” he said. Not everyone shared this view. A Ukrainian T-72 tank and armoured vehicle were stationed about 12 miles outside Kyiv. Other military vehicles trundled towards battle, as civilians streamed out on both sides of the road. There were new checkpoints, new walls, new realities. Soldiers with flashlights checked documents in the dark. Outside the city of Zhytomyr, police had built an impressive traffic-calming barrier from slabs of local granite. It was the same stone used to build Lenin’s mausoleum on Red Square in Moscow – in the country with which Ukraine was now at war. “Putin has turned into Hitler,” said Dima Yatsenko, a 35-year-old former lawyer. “This is all about his ambitions. He’s a small man like Napoleon.” Yatsenko said Putin had shown his true face after months of pretending to the world he was interested in a diplomatic solution to his grievances over Ukraine and Nato. Yatsenko said he was a little taken aback that Russia’s president had embarked on bloody conflict. “We are motivated. They are not. Look at Afghanistan or Iraq. We will resist and defend our territory,” he said. In normal circumstances the long drive west would have been an attractive one. The road cuts through green flashes of pine forest; crows roost in trees overrun with clumps of mistletoe. There are Catholic churches and homesteads with chickens. With so many cars on the road, there were inevitable crashes and the body of a dead dog. Many of those driving in the darkness were families with small children. Dmitry Vyacheslav – a Kyiv web designer stopping off for petrol at 3am – was travelling with his wife and three children, including the perky Tikon, aged eight months. Vyacheslav held Tikon, dressed in a romper suit, in his arms. “We will try and cross the Romanian border,” he said. The west had acted too slowly to help Ukraine, he added, which now faced extinction as an independent sovereign state. What should happen to Putin? “He should die,” Vyacheslav said. His parents were living in the city of Kherson, north of Crimea, which was on the brink of being overrun. The Russian army had made rapid advances, he said gloomily. The UN estimates about 5 million Ukrainians from a country of 40 million-plus are likely to escape abroad. According to border authorities, 29,000 people entered Poland from Ukraine on Thursday – invasion day. In Romania, more than 10,000 turned up, with another 3,000 going to Slovakia. It takes six to 12 hours to cross the Polish border. Transport is a growing problem, with taxis hard to find. Petrol stocks are running low. Drivers are only allowed to buy 20 litres each. The road to Medyka, 52 miles from Lviv, was packed with cars. Police directed traffic and relatives hugged loved ones when they arrived on the Polish side. Vera Ivanovna said she was not sure when – or even if – she would see her husband again. She had friends in Russia, she said, all of them appalled and terrified by Putin’s decision to declare war. “The situation is terrible and fantastical. I want to go back to my husband but my mother won’t let me.” She added: “I don’t understand. Why did Putin do this?”",News/World news,‘Terrible and fantastical’: fear and farewells on the road out of Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/terrible-and-fantastical-fear-and-farewells-on-the-road-out-of-ukraine-kyiv-russia
2/26/2022,"British nationals in Ukraine have expressed fear that they will be permanently separated from their Ukrainian families if they leave the country and return to the UK, while others have told of the difficulty in getting a visa. Mike Haley, 61, an English teacher and translator who has lived in Kyiv since 2005, said he would remain in the capital with his wife, Ala, regardless of advice from the government that all British nationals should leave. “I wouldn’t leave my wife,” Haley said. “I just don’t trust this government to behave normally – I have no faith that we would be reunited if I left. It feels like the entire system is rigged against people like us. If I go, I don’t know what I would be going into, so I’d prefer to just sit tight.” Haley said he, his wife and his 80-year-old mother-in-law dd not intend to leave their home. “We’ve got supplies in, filled the bath in case of fires, taped up the windows, got clean water in containers and non-perishable foods. We were here during the Maidan revolution. We’re prepared for what is to come.” Michael Bosher, an English teacher, arrived back in the UK on Thursday having travelled overland for two days with his Ukrainian wife, Yulia, after she was issued a one-year emergency visa on Tuesday. “I said I couldn’t leave without her, so we stayed until the last minute. As soon as the visa came through, we left,” Bosher said. “We got it in the nick of time. If it hadn’t arrived when it did, we would have been really stuck.” “I would have expected more from the government,” he added. “We knew war was coming – it shouldn’t have been so difficult to get out.” Bosher said he would now get a manual-labour job in the UK to ensure he met the £18,600 minimum income requirement for his wife to stay. On 17 February the Home Office announced new immigration concessions for family members of British nationals, temporarily waiving application fees for those eligible under the family migration route and granting entry for 12 months to those who do not meet the criteria. The department said that family visa decisions would be made within 24 hours of the applicant attending a biometric appointment. On Thursday, the Home Office announced further visa changes for Ukrainians in the UK on work, study or visit visas, temporarily extending their visas and allowing those eligible to switch to different visa routes. For unmarried couples, the situation is more complex. Jeremy Myers, 44, and his partner, Maria Romanenko, 29, applied for a visitor visa weeks ago. They aren’t married, so they are not eligible for a family visa. “We haven’t been living together for two years and I don’t live in Ukraine full-time, so it’s very different for us,” Myers said. “Maria was charged £45 – a 50% premium – in order not to surrender her passport, just before the country went to war. That was considered a ‘special offer’ due to tough times. “The other thing is that the visa might be rejected, despite always having had a visa for over 15 years, it’s not guaranteed, even now.” The couple planned to leave Kyiv on Friday to travel to Poland, where they would wait for the decision on Maria’s visa application. Marta Mulyak, head of the London branch of Plast National Scout Organisation of Ukraine, also expressed frustration with the British visa application process, which she said had left her mother in limbo. Mulyak, 39, said: “Although the British government said last week that Ukrainians can apply for visas in different centres in Ukraine, after paying £1,500 you’re only given the option to book the biometrics appointment, where they scan the iris and the fingerprints, in Kyiv. Going to Kyiv, even this Monday, was risky. Some people that I know went just for work and now they cannot leave because there’s bombing. “So my mum’s visa application just ran out of time. And the application is bloody long. My mum had to provide her travel history for 10 years. It has been a real nightmare. I rang the helpline today, yesterday and the day before but they didn’t answer.” Olesya Khromeychuk, the director of the Ukrainian Institute London cultural centre, called on the UK government to open its borders to those fleeing from the Russian invasion. “There will be refugees. We need to open our borders. This is our duty here. It’s a humanitarian crisis.” If this was not an option, then ministers should review the “humiliating, lengthy and extremely expensive application process”, she added, to signal that Ukrainians are welcome.",News/World news,British nationals fear permanent separation from Ukrainian family,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/british-nationals-fear-permanent-separation-from-ukraine-family-russia
2/26/2022,"Two years ago exactly, Joe Biden stood on a debate stage in Charleston, South Carolina, his candidacy on the ropes, and made a promise: if elected president, he would nominate the first Black woman to the supreme court. Days later, Biden won the South Carolina primary on the strength of his support among Black voters. The victory propelled him to the Democratic nomination and then to the presidency. Last month, Justice Stephen Breyer announced his retirement, presenting Biden with an opportunity to fulfill that campaign commitment. On Friday, Biden will stand before a podium in the White House’s Cross Hall to nominate Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the nation’s highest court. If eventually confirmed by the senate, she will be the first Black woman to serve on the supreme court in its 232-year history. It is a rare moment of celebration for Biden, embattled on nearly every front. His once hugely ambitious domestic agenda is stalled, perhaps permanently; the Democrats’ tenuous control of Congress faces historic headwinds; and the international order that Biden spent much of his political career defending faces its gravest threat in decades after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But the nomination of a supreme court justice is one of the most enduring acts of any president’s legacy. And for Biden, it is particularly resonant. Biden has said that he hopes the diversity he has brought to the federal government will be long-lasting. After serving as the vice-president to the nation’s first Black president, he chose Kamala Harris to be his running mate, which led her to become the first Black and Asian American woman to serve as vice-president. His cabinet is the most diverse in US history. And in his first year, Biden nominated a record number of district and appeals court judges from a range of racial, ethnic, geographical and legal backgrounds. Black voters, and Black women especially, were the driving force behind Biden’s nomination and his presidency. According to exit polls in 2020, Black women were his most loyal supporters, with 90% casting their ballots for him. In January 2021, Black female organizers in Georgia helped Democrats win two Senate runoff elections, cementing the party’s control of the chamber and delivering to Biden narrow but meaningful congressional majorities. Yet Biden has failed to enact much of his racial justice agenda. Democrats failed to overcome a Republican filibuster of voting rights legislation, designed to combat the raft of restrictive voting laws being enacted by conservative legislatures across the country. Attempts at policing reform sputtered last year, while the economic provisions of his Build Back Better agenda intended to combat soaring income inequality remain stalled in the Senate amid opposition from his own party. In that sense, Jackson’s nomination is a rare opportunity for Biden to make good on a promise to Black women. Democrats alone could confirm Jackson to the supreme court, with Harris breaking the tie. When Jackson was confirmed to the appeals court last year, she won the support of three Republican senators. But one of them, Senator Lindsey Graham, already criticized her nomination, saying it was a sign that the “radical left has won President Biden over yet again”. But for many, Jackson’s nomination, at the end of Black History Month, was cause for celebration. “She is eminently qualified to serve our nation on our highest court,” said Harris, a former federal prosecutor. “And while she will be the first Black woman on the supreme court, Judge Jackson will not be the last.” Barack Obama, who nominated Jackson to serve as a district court judge in Washington DC, said the judge had “already inspired young Black women like my daughters to set their sights higher and her confirmation will help them believe they can be anything they want to be”. In nominating Jackson, Biden recalled a formative exchange between a teenage Jackson and her high school guidance counselor. When she told her counselor that she wanted to attend Harvard, the counselor warned her that she should not set her expectations “so high”. “That didn’t stop Judge Jackson,” Biden said. “She graduated magna cum laude from Harvard College, then attended Harvard Law School, where she graduated cum laude and was an editor of the Harvard Law Review.” Now, she is poised to make history as a supreme court justice.",News/US news,Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination is rare moment of celebration for Biden,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/25/ketanji-brown-jackson-nomination-biden-analysis
2/26/2022,"The death of Mark Lanegan, the former vocalist with the bands Screaming Trees and Queens of the Stone Age, at the age of 57, feels painfully premature, but he had been walking a tightrope for most of his life. Last year, Covid-19 rendered him deaf, unable to walk and frequently comatose; he wrote a terrifying account of the experience in Devil in a Coma (2021). As a teenager he had numerous brushes with the law for drug and alcohol offences. A notorious drunk by the time he was 12, he admitted that he had started taking heroin as a way to beat his alcohol problem. At 20, he was run over by a tractor; the accident came just as he was preparing to leave his native Washington state and head for Las Vegas. Instead of going to Nevada, he ended up joining the prototype grunge band Screaming Trees, which set him off on his musical career. Despite releasing a string of frequently impressive albums, which helped establish Lanegan as an expressive singer blessed with a rich and dark array of vocal tones, the group were handicapped by violent personality clashes, and never hit the commercial heights enjoyed by contemporaries such as Nirvana or Soundgarden. By the time Screaming Trees called it quits in 2000, Lanegan was already four albums into a solo career. This had begun in 1990 when he released The Winding Sheet, a brooding and downbeat set of songs typified by his doomy version of Lead Belly’s Where Did You Sleep Last Night. This featured Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain on guitar, and the song also entered Nirvana’s repertoire. All of the dozen solo discs he released over a 30-year period had much to offer in different ways, helping to affirm Lanegan’s status as a writer and performer who was compared to such idiosyncratic artists as Leonard Cohen and Nick Cave. He was born in Ellensburg, Washington, a small town 130 miles from Seattle, where the local industries were logging and farming. His parents, Dale and Floy, were both teachers. He recalled listening to albums by the country artists Johnny Cash, George Jones and Willie Nelson in the family home, as well as Frank Sinatra and Andy Williams, but he suffered an abusive upbringing which prompted him to take refuge in drink and narcotics. In a 2019 interview for the Come to Where I’m From podcast, he described how different branches of his family were Catholic, Jehovah’s Witnesses and “some religious cult that doesn’t even have a name”, from which he had concluded that “organised religion for me is just so much bullshit.” He recalled the time when his father retreated to a cabin in the Cascade mountains to live a hermit’s life. At Ellensburg high school, as well as soaking up punk records by bands such as the Damned and the Sex Pistols, he became friendly with Van Conner, whose family gave him a job repossessing electrical goods from customers behind on their payments. Van invited Lanegan to play drums in the band he had formed with his brother Gary Lee Conner, but since he proved to be a far better singer than drummer, Mark Pickerel took over the drum stool while Lanegan moved to lead vocals. Thus Screaming Trees were formed in 1984, and they released their debut album, Clairvoyance, in 1986. The band built a following on the indie circuit with their raw, punk-charged songs, but it was not until 1992 that they broke through to a wide audience when their song Nearly Lost You was used in the movie Singles and became a hit on the US alternative airplay and mainstream rock charts. This was from their sixth album, Sweet Oblivion, with Screaming Trees now signed to Epic, having been with the independent label SST. They enjoyed more success with the single Dollar Bill, while their final album, Dust (1996), reached the Top 40 in the UK and produced a hit single with All I Know. The band by now had matured way beyond their ragged garage-band beginnings, though the strings, acoustic guitar and harmonies on the anthemic song Sworn and Broken might have sounded alarmingly mainstream for some fans. Lanegan’s stint with Queens of the Stone Age began after he struck up a friendship with the band’s founder, Josh Homme, while he toured with Screaming Trees as an extra guitarist. Lanegan was a permanent member for a time, then enjoyed a friendly arrangement as a part-time contributor. This eventually ended by mutual consent. “It was too easy,” Lanegan confessed. “I needed to do something else.” It was with Homme that Lanegan wrote the theme song for the TV chef Anthony Bourdain’s show Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. Bourdain’s suicide in 2018 was particularly grim for Lanegan, who had already been scarred by Cobain’s suicide and the drug-overdose death of another close friend, Layne Staley of the Seattle band Alice in Chains. Lanegan and Staley (along with Pearl Jam’s Mike McCready) had been members of the grunge supergroup Mad Season, who released the album Above (1995). Lanegan enjoyed successful collaborations with numerous artists, but fared especially well in his partnership with Isobel Campbell (formerly of Belle & Sebastian). They made three albums together, one of them, Ballad of the Broken Seas (2006), earning a Mercury prize nomination. He formed the Gutter Twins with Greg Dulli, and released the album Saturnalia (2008). Dulli described the collaboration as “the Satanic Everly Brothers”. Lanegan was also developing a successful career as an author. He exhibited his gifts as a poet in Plague Poems (2020, with Wesley Eisold) and Leaving California (2021), while the autobiographical memoir Sing Backwards and Weep (2020), a horrifying odyssey of addiction and dysfunction, earned lavish praise from readers and critics. At the time of his death, Lanegan was living in Killarney, County Kerry, with his second wife, Shelley Brien, who survives him. His first marriage, to Wendy Rae Fowler, ended in divorce.
