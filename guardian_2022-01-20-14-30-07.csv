1/20/2022,"Hey guys. I’m just gonna come out and, like, say it. This year, I’m becoming a full-blown bimbo. I know what you’re thinking, lol. You’re probably thinking that’s a really stupid thing to say.  Which is the point entirely. “Bimbofication” – the scientific term for becoming stupid and hot – has been bouncing around the internet for a few years now. It started out on TikTok, with American creators like Chrissy Chlapecka embracing a very specific brand of hyperfemininity. Wearing highly-flammable hair extensions and skin-tight polyester outfits, Chlapecka speaks to the camera in a baby voice, discussing everything from politics and mental illness, right through to “the feminine urge to buy my stupid little $7 coffee & stare at my stupid little thousand dollar phone to fill the void”. weeeee pic.twitter.com/IaOPGA3wbB And not gonna lie, when I first saw her videos, I was conflicted. On the one hand, they spoke to me aesthetically. I’m outrageously attracted to the colour pink. But on the other hand, which I should clarify is manicured, I was irritated. Why was she speaking like that? Why was this bleach blonde, big-bosomed woman talking like a toddler? I couldn’t work it out. Then I realised I’m not meant to. The ethos of the 2022 bimbo is to have “less thoughts” and “more vibes”. It’s a purposeful rejection of my generation’s propensity to catastrophise and diagnose. And after two years of uncertainty, we’ve come to realise there’s no point in trying to out-think things like pandemics or mathematics. It’s easier to just be hot. And for this gorgeous gorgeous girl, it feels like a return to centre. I’ve always wanted to be a bimbo, in my heart of hearts. I think it’s got something to do with being a kid in the 00s. I grew up on a diet of Playboy bunnies and Pussycat Dolls. And it’s a miracle I didn’t grow up on a diet, full stop. In Y2K pop culture, almost every woman who was afforded ample screen time was impossibly attractive and in some way, a bimbo. With Legally Blonde the rare exception, the women in these movies were a bit silly at best, and at worst, morally corrupt. Take for example Mean Girls. While I’m sure the message Tiny Fey was hoping to send when she wrote Regina George was that being a vain, popular bitch is bad and increases your chances of being hit by a bus, my 8-year-old self missed the point entirely. I wanted to be her. I wanted to drive a convertible Lexus. I wanted to be the most popular girl in school. And if I needed to be a bimbo to get there, I’d oblige. In this early 2000s version of bimbofication, the very act of performative femininity was considered vapid and worthy of ridicule. Women were just one more “like” or “umm” away from being cast off entirely, relegated to the aisle of Chemist Warehouse that stocks Paris Hilton’s eau de toilette. And it wasn’t just men who had a thing or two to say about women who wore their jeans slung low and their g-strings high with pride. Books like Female Chauvinist Pigs by Ariel Levy put the “phenomenon” of “raunch culture” on blast, suggesting women who wore Playboy bunny paraphernalia were making themselves the butt of the joke. A taut one, at that. As a young girl who loved pink, this left me with few options. I hated physical sports and loved going to Kmart to nag my parents for new Bratz Dolls and a pack of Lip Smackers. I knew, though, that wearing a miniskirt probably lowered my IQ. There was no option to be hot and smart. And that’s why this new wave of self-aware bimbofication is so deeply exciting. We’re entering the decade of the bimbo, I can feel it in my 300CC breast implants. We’re reclaiming the word, appliquéing it with rhinestones and presenting it on the internet, in our own, like, words. Then we’re lying back down on our fluffy pink pillows to get our beauty sleep because we’re not pressed on whether you like it or not. Unlike the earlier manifestations of bimbofication, anyone can be one in 2022. Men, women, theys and thems. Luxuriating in extreme femme energy is our version of burning our bras – only this time it’s our fingers click-clacking across the keyboard, celebrating bimbocentric causes like Britney Spears’ emancipation. So here’s my pledge. In 2022, I’m going to be the dumbest person I know. I’m going to stop removing the excess exclamation marks in my emails … a technique I used to employ so people might take me more seriously!!! And sorry, I’m not going to rein in my use of the word “sorry”. I’m not going to unsoften myself in order to be taken seriously. I’m going to walk on a treadmill in a full face of makeup, listening to Kim Petras sing about her coconuts, nodding along because yass queen. Do you know what I mean? If you don’t, that’s OK. In fact, that’s hot.

1/20/2022,"Surfing great Kelly Slater could be the next big name in sport to be refused the right to compete in Australia, with the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, saying he wants to avoid another “soap opera” if the 11-time world champion is not vaccinated against Covid. Slater, who has not publicly disclosed his Covid vaccination status, has aired some controversial views on the Covid vaccine, including an Instagram comment in October that claimed he knew “more about being healthy than 99% of doctors”.  The American tour veteran, who has no medical qualifications, has previously said he is not anti-vaccine but opposed to making vaccination mandatory. Slater has also been critical of the visa process that ended with the recent deportation of tennis world No 1 Novak Djokovic. The best surfers in the world are scheduled to arrive in Australia for back-to-back World Surf League events at Victoria’s Bells Beach and Western Australia’s Margaret River in March and April this year. Andrews said he hoped there would be no repeat of the saga that overshadowed the build-up to the Australian Open and left Djokovic unable to defend his title at Melbourne Park. “It’s important there is clarity from the commonwealth government about who gets in and who doesn’t,” Andrews said on Thursday. “That is a good thing. Least you don’t have a soap opera, drama, that wastes everybody’s time. Tennis is bigger than any one person [Djokovic] and we’re seeing that ... whether it’s at any of the venues down at Melbourne Park.” Andrews said it was unlikely the state government would open discussions with the World Surf League over possible exemptions for unvaccinated athletes following the Djokovic debacle. “That’s kind of a moot point because the commonwealth government have been very clear,” Andrews said. “Clearer now than they have been for a while, which is good.” On Wednesday, the federal sports minister, Richard Colbeck, said there was “no chance of getting into the country” for Slater if he was unvaccinated. “I reckon he knows the rules,” Colbeck told Nine newspapers. “It doesn’t matter whether you’re a surfer, or a tennis player, a tourist or anyone else, those are the rules. They apply to everyone. “I don’t like the chances of him competing in Victoria and I’d hate to think of what the chances were of him competing in Western Australia.”",Sport/Sport,Surfer Kelly Slater unlikely to be let into Australia if he’s not vaccinated against Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/20/kelly-slater-australia-covid-vaccine-rules-visa-not-vaccinated-surfer-world-surf-league
1/20/2022,"Armadas of alien-like sea creatures have been washing up on Australian beaches thanks to the warm weather but experts warn people should look but not touch. Jellyfish expert Dr Lisa-ann Gershwin said bluebottles had been washing up on beaches across New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania in “gobsmacking numbers” over the last few months thanks to the warmer weather.  “They’re having a really fun time this year and they’re definitely terrorising us this year,” Gershwin said. “They’re really strange alien creatures. There’s no two ways about it. “It doesn’t have any equal to people, or animals, or corals, or things we understand intuitively. It’s just their own brand of weirdness in such a cool way.” A population of bluebottles on the move is known as an “armada” and the species is evolutionarily descended from jellyfish in the same way humans are related to monkeys or apes. They are also the closest known relative of the Portuguese man o’ war and distantly to Porpita porpita, a marine organism with a circular float but no sail. Every bluebottle population floats freely on the surface of the ocean, made up of “an unbelievable number” of individual “colonies”. These colonies are what are commonly referred to as “bluebottles” but are actually a collection of semi-autonomous parts fused together. Each colony is also either left-handed or right-handed, with the sail on top of the animal angled one way or the other. When a breeze picks up at just the right angle, it will carry off only a small number of colonies at any given time, ensuring the whole population isn’t lost in one gust. Even more weirdly, every individual bluebottle colony is a hermaphrodite with both male and female reproductive organs, and each of the autonomous components is responsible for its own function such as feeding, stinging or reproduction. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Gershwin said that for humans it would be as if each arm and leg operated entirely independently, with each limb having its own critical job required to keep the whole alive. Bluebottles themselves are preyed upon by Glaucus, otherwise known as the “sea lizard” or “Pokémon slug”. Glaucus are often washed up on shore with the bluebottle, and looks like a lizard but is actually a sea slug that feeds on the colony and “steals” its stingers for its own defence. Gershwin said there was a still much to learn about the biology of this “amazing feat of nature” as it was difficult to track down where they originate and then to study them before they complete their lifecycle. However, what is known is the complex changes brought by climate change are likely to create ideal breeding environments for bluebottles and other jellyfish species which already reproduce “faster than rabbits”.

If someone finds a bluebottle washed up on the beach, Gershwin encouraged people to look but warned they should not touch, poke or stomp on the animals as even in death they can sting. “These things bloody hurt,” she said. Bluebottles excrete a microscopic mucus on their tentacles that is invisible and cannot be felt when touched but which contains thousands of stinging cells that are “armed and dangerous” as they inject venom into the skin on contact. Even where a person uses a stick to poke at the creature, it will collect the microscopic film which can then be found by a dog or other animal when left behind. There have also been cases where young children stomped on the animals and the venom has splashed into the eyes of someone watching. Gershwin, who once allowed herself to be stung 80 times to test various methods at treating the stings, said the pain was “excruciating” with the closest comparable feeling akin to being splashed with scalding hot cooking oil. “I let my curiosity overwhelm my common sense,” she said. “It was, hands down, the stupidest thing I’ve ever done. Let me go on record: I paid a big price for it. I was in a lot of pain and I was very swollen. I do not recommend anyone do the same.” If someone is stung, Gershwin says the advice from the Australian Marine Stinger Advisory Services is to first wash the sting in ocean water to clean off any stinging cells, before cleansing with either very hot water – as hot as a person can stand it before pulling away – or very cold water “for the pain”. Even if nothing is done, however, the pain will resolve in 30 minutes on its own. Gershwin said people shouldn’t “run screaming” but take a moment to appreciate the “fascinating creatures”. “This is nature standing up on her haunches and showing off with a brightly coloured, frilly dress,” she said. “But also: don’t touch.”",News/Australia news,‘Terrorising us’: bluebottles wash up on Australian beaches in ‘gobsmacking numbers’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/20/terrorising-us-bluebottles-wash-up-on-australian-beaches-in-gobsmacking-numbers
1/20/2022,"The Australian Open farewell tour continued longer than expected. Now, having played her encore, Samantha Stosur will leave the stage on a high. This second-round appearance was Stosur’s 797th tour-level singles match, of which she has won more than 450. On Wednesday, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova ensured there would not be a 798th, the Russian dispatching the Australian veteran 6-2, 6-2. On a day of upsets in the women’s draw, this was not one of them. The defeat at Kia Arena was emphatic. There was no hint of a comeback similar to that gritty first-round performance against American wildcard Robin Anderson. But even after Pavlyuchenkova broke her serve to take a 5-2 second-set lead and successfully served out the match, Stosur’s smile was unmoving. The occasion, for once, meant more than the tennis.  Stosur played her first professional match at the age of 14. At 17, she contested her first Australian Open. Since then she has climbed all the way to the top, to world No 4 and the 2011 US Open trophy. Now, 20 years later and ranked 487th, she has earned the right to hop off at the bottom. “I have done more than I ever thought was possible,” she said to a standing ovation, which preceded a dedicated video tribute and presentation from Tennis Australia. “I dreamed of winning a grand slam and doing close to the things I did. To do what I have done dreaming as a little kid is phenomenal. I couldn’t have asked for more. I’ve had many great moments here in Australia and around the world. Yeah, it’s been amazing.” Pavlyuchenkova too was taken by the moment. “It was actually very emotional for me,” she said. “I had goosebumps when everybody was clapping for Sam. She is such a wonderful human being and also amazing tennis player, so thank you Sam.” Pressure has forever plagued Stosur at her home slam and positivity has rarely been afforded to the Queenslander, who has never make it past the fourth round and failed to win a single match in five consecutive attempts between 2016 and 2020. Overall, in her previous 19 campaigns, she was knocked out in the first round eight times. The very fact she made the second round at her 20th – she now equals Lleyton Hewitt’s record for most Australian Open appearances – is testament to the palpable, almost unrecognisable sense of freedom with which she overcame Anderson. It was the first time Stosur had successfully staged an Australian Open comeback after dropping the first set since 2003, when she did so against Spanish star Conchita Martínez. And so she will walk away from singles as one of the greats of Australian tennis, who beat Serena Williams in the 2011 US Open final, who spent 441 consecutive weeks between 2008 and 2017 as the top-ranked Australian singles player of either gender, and who was a fixture in the world’s top 25 for nine consecutive years. “Thank you to everyone who has been along with me the 20 years,” she said. “The coaches, they know who they are, they have all helped me in some way on and off the court, shaped me into the person I am. The family – they are all down there now – mum and dad, my brothers for giving up everything early on driving me to tournaments on the weekend, getting dragged along for Sam’s tennis. But I think it was all worth it, so thanks for giving everything you’ve got as well. “Obviously my partner, thanks Liz, standing by me and getting me through the hard times and also the good times. Little Evie at home, I hope you’re awake, I say hello to you. Everyone on the sideline, I’ve had a great time, thanks for all being here. If I missed anyone I’m sorry, but I love you all.”",Sport/Sport,‘I couldn’t have asked for more’: Sam Stosur finally bows out as Australian tennis great,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/20/i-couldnt-have-asked-for-more-sam-stosur-finally-bows-out-as-australian-tennis-great
