12/11/2021,"A California woman accused of encouraging her daughter to hit an opposing player during a youth basketball tournament last month has been charged with misdemeanors this week.

Driving the news: The incident was caught on a video that has since gone viral on social media. The victim, Lauryn Ham, a 15-year-old Asian American girl, received treatment for a bruised neck and concussion.
 The incident occurred during a game between the SoCal Blaze and Dream Academy teams at the MAP Sports Facility in Garden Grove on Nov. 7. Lauryn, who plays for the former, was attacked in the last four minutes. Prior to the incident, the attacker — who is also a minor — fell backwards onto Lauryn after shooting a three-pointer. When both got up and walked to the other side of the court, the attacker’s mother allegedly yelled, “You better hit her for that.” As seen in the video, Lauryn’s attacker swung at her, causing her to fall down. The game was reportedly stopped and the attacker and her mother were sent home. Lauryn’s mother, Alice, told NextShark that her daughter suffered from shock and was taken to an urgent care facility for treatment. Alice first shared the video of the incident on Instagram. “I don’t believe the child should be allowed to play basketball for the foreseeable future until she can get help. The mother should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law for inciting violence,” Alice told NextShark. 
 


The charges: The attacker’s mother, Latira Shonty Hunt, 44, was charged with battery and contributing to the delinquency of a minor, the Associated Press reported. She faces up to a year in jail if found guilty.
 “It is unconscionable that a parent would encourage her child to engage in violence during a sporting event,” a press release quoted Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer as saying. “Youth sports are invaluable in teaching our children discipline, teamwork, and sportsmanship. But a win at all costs mentality that is completely devoid of fair play, respect, and civility is disgusting. We as parents have the fundamental responsibility to raise our children to be good human beings who treat others with kindness and humanity.” Kevin Hahn, the victim’s lawyer, said the family is pleased to see the district attorney file charges. He stressed that the attacker “clearly acted at the direction of her mother,” NBC Los Angeles noted. “We believe that this is the correct decision and the first step towards ensuring that there is accountability,” KTLA quoted the Ham family’s statement. “There is no place in sports for a parent to incite violence against another child. We are hopeful that this will serve to discourage this type of behavior in the future.” The attacker’s father, former NBA player Corey Benjamin, released a statement apologizing for his daughter’s actions in the aftermath of the incident. “To the young lady who was punched by my daughter during a youth basketball game, I sincerely apologize to you and I am praying for your complete healing both physically and emotionally,” Benjamin said, as per ABC News. “To her family, I deeply apologize and regret that this happened to your daughter as she did not deserve this to happen to her. Finally, I apologize to all of those who have been impacted and hurt by the actions of my daughter as well as those of her mother.”

12/11/2021,"A woman has amused viewers on TikTok by sharing the moment her grandmother realised that the leggings she was wearing were actually emblazoned with curse words rather than pinstripes. In a video posted to the app this week by a woman named Chelsea, who goes by the username @chels_bb, she can be seen zooming in on her grandmother’s black leggings, which at first glance appear to be designed with white pinstripes. However, as the TikTok shows, the pants are actually decorated with the words “f*** you” written in a tiny print. “My nana thought these pants were pinstriped,” Chelsea captioned the clip, in which a woman who is likely the TikToker’s mother can be heard telling the older woman: “Nope, they say ‘f*** you,’ Mom.” The realisation prompted a stunned reaction from Chelsea’s grandmother, who replied with a drawn-out: “Oh my god” as the camera angle panned up to show her horrified expression. The endearing clip, which has been viewed more than 10.5m times, has been met with amusement from viewers, with one person writing: “Those pants are amazing. Your nana is amazing. All around, everything here is amazing.” Another person joked: “Nana knew what they said, she had to play it off though.” The TikTok also prompted a response from Chelsea Handler, who commented: “Whoopsiedoodle.” #fyp #nana #SimsSelves #KraftMacMeSkip #MacysGiftTok In addition to those who found the clip entertaining, there were also numerous viewers who questioned where they could buy the pants worn by Chelsea’s grandmother in the video. “I’d wear them constantly. Where’d she get them?” one person asked, while another said: “Ok but nana looks awesome in her FU pants. And I need them, so where does your nana shop?” In a follow-up video, Chelsea addressed the response to her grandmother’s outfit mishap, with the TikToker revealing that she didn’t expect the video to go as viral as it has. Chelsea also took the opportunity to praise her grandmother, adding: “My nana is just a gem of a person,” before revealing that the leggings can be purchased on RedBubble. Chelsea then clarified that her grandmother had not been the one to purchase the leggings, as they had actually been bought by her late aunt. #SimsSelves #fyp #KraftMacMeSkip #homeimprovement “And when she passed away, my nana took some of her clothes, and she genuinely didn’t know that they said what they said,” she continued. In another follow-up video, Chelsea revealed that she had been unsuccessful in her attempt to get a discount code for all those who wanted to purchase the leggings after viewing her TikTok. #nana #ShareTheMagic #PawlidayPics #homeimprovement However, she did note that she planned to buy a pair of the pants for herself.

12/11/2021,"By Nandita Bose and Mohammad Zargham WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said he was ""deeply troubled"" by Kellogg Co's plans to hire permanent replacements for striking unionized employees after they voted down a proposed contract this week. Biden, who has put unions at the center of his policymaking, said such actions undermine the critical role collective bargaining plays in giving workers a voice. ""Permanently replacing striking workers is an existential attack on the union and its members' jobs and livelihoods. I have long opposed permanent striker replacements and I strongly support legislation that would ban that practice,"" Biden said in a statement. Kellogg said earlier this week that a majority of its U.S. cereal plant workers had voted against a new five-year contract, forcing it to hire permanent replacements as employees extend a strike that started more than two months ago. Kellogg spokesperson Kris Bahner said on Friday the company is ""ready, willing and able to negotiate with the union"" and has made every effort to reach a fair agreement, including making six comprehensive offers to the union throughout negotiations. ""We agree that this needs to be solved at the bargaining table. Our objective has been – and continues to be – to reach a fair agreement for our people,"" Bahner said in a statement. This is the second time Biden has weighed in on a key labor action to express his support for unions and the organized labor movement. In February, he defended workers' rights to form unions as Amazon.com Inc employees in Alabama prepared to vote on whether to unionize. Last month, a regional director for the U.S. National Labor Relations Board ordered a rerun of that election, which ended in a defeat for the union effort. Biden and Democrats have tried to stop the practice of permanently replacing workers who are striking, which is currently legal, via the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act. The legislation was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in March but faces long odds in the Senate. The percentage of U.S. workers represented by a union fell almost 15 percentage points between 1979 and 2020, according to the White House. That drop, the White House says, has cost workers $200 billion a year in unrealized wages and benefits. Actions taken by Biden, who is considered one of the most pro-union presidents in the history of the United States, has offered the U.S. labor movement significant momentum, Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, told the Reuters Next Conference last week.
