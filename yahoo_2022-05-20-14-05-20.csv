5/20/2022,"Wall Street pays a ton of attention to company earnings. But reported earnings are often manipulated through aggressive or even fraudulent accounting methods. That’s why risk-averse investors need to focus on companies that generate gobs of free cash flow. Cold, hard cash is real, and can be used by shareholder-friendly management teams to: Pay inflation-fighting dividends. Repurchase shares. Grow the business organically. Investing legend and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett is famous for his love of cash flow-producing businesses. Let’s take a look at three stocks in Berkshire’s portfolio that boast double-digit free cash flow margins (free cash flow as a percentage of sales). Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. Leading off our list is oil and gas giant Chevron, which has generated $21.1 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months and consistently posts free cash flow margins in the ballpark of 11%. The shares have been hot in recent months on the strong rebound in energy prices, but with inflation continuing to heat up, there might be plenty of room left to run. Management’s recent initiatives to cut costs and improve efficiency are starting to take hold and should be able to fuel shareholder-friendly actions for the foreseeable future. In March, Chevron announced that it would double its share buyback to as much as $10 billion a year, promising that shareholders will see the benefits of high oil prices. The stock still offers an attractive dividend yield of 3.4%. With whopping free cash flow margins above 30%, credit ratings leader Moody’s is next up on our list. Despite recent weakness, Moody’s shares are up 145% over the past five years, suggesting that it’s a relatively recession-resistant business worth betting on. Specifically, the company’s well-entrenched leadership position in credit ratings, which leads to outsized cash flow and returns on capital, should continue to limit Moody’s long-term downside Moody’s has generated about $1.8 billion in trailing twelve-month free cash flow. And in 2021, the company returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Moody’s has a dividend yield of 1.0%. Rounding out our list is beverage giant Coca-Cola, which has produced $7 billion in trailing twelve-month free cash flow and habitually delivers free cash flow margins above 20%. The stock has had plenty of ups and downs in recent months, but patient investors should look to take advantage of the short-term uncertainty. Coca-Cola’s long-term investment case continues to be backed by an unrivaled brand presence, massive scale efficiencies, and still-attractive geographic growth tailwinds. And the company is back to operating at pre-pandemic levels. In the most recent quarter, Coca-Cola posted revenue of $10.5 billion, up 16% from the year-ago period, driven largely by a 8% increase in unit case volume. Coca-Cola shares offer a dividend yield of 2.9%.

5/20/2022,"SpaceX paid $250,000 to settle a sexual misconduct claim against Elon Musk after a flight attendant on the company’s corporate jet accused the CEO of exposing himself to her mid-flight, Insider reports. According to Insider, the incident happened in 2016 and the company settled with the unnamed flight attendant in 2018, according to a friend of the flight attendant who was told contemporaneously about the incident but is not bound by any non-disclosure agreements with the company. Musk allegedly asked for a “full body massage” and offered to buy the flight attendant a horse if she would “do more.” Insider also notes that the flight attendant was encouraged pay out of her own pocket for professional massage training so that she could better serve Musk during flights. It was during a massage amid a flight to London when Musk allegedly exposed himself and ""propositioned"" her. ""He touched her thigh and told her he would buy her a horse,"" the friend said in describing the incident. ""And he basically tried to bribe her to perform some sort of sexual favor."" The flight attendant reportedly refused Musk's advances, and later felt like she was being ""punished"" with fewer shifts at SpaceX. She settled with Musk in 2018 ""after a session with a mediator that Musk personally attended,"" Insider says. According to the report, Musk responded to questions by saying there was “a lot more to this story,” but didn’t elaborate. ""If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light,"" he told the publication.

5/20/2022,"Rising interest rates, supply chain constraints and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are all issues currently plaguing the macro climate. The problem with all three, says Tony Dwyer, Canaccord Chief Market Strategist, is that for each problem there’s “no easy exit strategy.” The tough conditions are likely to persist, then. However, on the plus side, while these issues have sent most corners of the stock market into a tailspin, now investors are presented with stocks for which the term “oversold” readily applies. “Our playbook remains the same – our tactical indicators are oversold/ pessimistic enough to suggest a summer rally that should make up losses from here,” Dwyer commented. Against this backdrop, some Street analysts have pointed out three “oversold” stocks that are due to let off some steam and push higher. We’ve used the TipRanks database to see why they are poised for a rebound. Let's take a closer look. Aptiv (APTV) We’ll start off with Aptiv, an automotive technology firm with a global footprint. Aptiv provides products, systems, and software to the automotive industry – namely to vehicle manufacturers which use the company’s offerings to make cars safer, improve efficiency and increase interconnectivity. The tech firm used to be known as Delphi before it spun off its powertrain segments and rebranded to Aptiv. This is a big operation, with 155,000 employees and 14 technical centers, in addition to customer support centers and manufacturing sites spread across 45 countries. The auto industry’s struggles during recent times have been well-documented with supply chain bottlenecks and chip shortages impacting production. Despite these issues, Aptiv managed to dial in a solid 1Q22 report. The company beat the forecasts on both the top-and bottom-line. Revenue increased by 4% year-over-year to reach $4.18 billion, beating the $4.06 billion consensus estimate. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.63 also came in above the analysts’ forecast of $0.61. The 2022 outlook was also positive; Aptiv anticipates revenue in the $17.75 billion to $18.15 billion range. Consensus had $17.79 billion. However, the stock has been unable to withstand the bearish trends and is now down by 43% year-to-date. It is the combination of its standing in the sector, and the shares’ depressed level that is enticing to Raymond James' 5-star analyst Brian Gesuale. “APTV’s leading position in electrification and active safety, award momentum and proactive cost controls provide the foundation for our 2022 outlook and sets up 2023 to be a very interesting year as headwinds abate. We continue to believe APTV is one of the best positioned companies to benefit from an auto production rebound given its strong portfolio geared to electrification, connected, and autonomous adoption themes… In our opinion [APTV] appears to be reaching oversold territory amidst shorter-term concerns impacting auto production and mixed reviews on the Wind River acquisition,” Gesuale opined. Based on all of the above factors, Gesuale rates Aptiv shares a Buy and sets a $158 price target. The analyst, apparently, believes the stock could surge 66% over the next twelve months. (To watch Gesuale’s track record, click here) Most on the Street agree. Brushing aside 1 Sell and 2 Hold ratings, with 15 Buys, the analyst consensus rates the stock a Strong Buy. The forecast calls for 12-month gains of ~58%, considering the average price target clocks in at $149.94. (See Aptiv stock forecast on TipRanks) Avid Technology (AVID) We’ll stay in tech mode for our next name but move to a company that operates in an entirely different field. Avid is a major player in the media and entertainment industry for which it provides a wide spectrum of tools and workflow solutions - including both hardware and software. These high-end offerings are used in the making of everything from award-winning feature films and blockbusters to TV shows to some of the most successful music on the planet, the products being a staple of editing suites and music studios. Avid’s portfolio of products includes Pro Tools, Media Composer, Sibelius, Avid VENUE, Avid NEXIS, MediaCentral and FastServe. AVID stock was faring rather well in 2022’s rough stock market but took a severe beating after delivering Q1 earnings in early May. Revenue increased by 6.7% from the same period last year to reach $100.6 million. However, that managed to come in near the low end of guidance for $100 million-$106 million. It also fell short of the Street’s forecast of $103 million. The company cited a lack of key components for its audio solutions as to why revenue came in softer than expectations. Adj. earnings of $0.33 per share also missed, coming in just shy of the $0.34 consensus estimate. Supply chain problems are also expected to impact near-term results. For Q2, Avid guided for revenue between $92 million-$104 million, lower at the midpoint than the consensus estimate of $99.61 million. The company called for adj. EPS in the $0.19-$0.32 range; the Street had $0.28 – higher than the mid-point of the guidance. With the shares still down ~19% since the earnings report, Maxim analyst Jack Vander Aarde views the stock’s performance as “significantly oversold and unjustified.” But that is not the only reason why Vander Aarde finds Avid’s value proposition appealing. “Avid has converted less than ~10% of its existing enterprise customers to a subscription model (launched in 4Q20), so there is clearly a significant opportunity to drive subscription growth from converting existing enterprise customers alone, as well as additional growth opportunity from winning new enterprise customers,” the 5-star analyst opined. Vander Aarde rates AVID a Buy while his $42 price target makes room for one-year returns of ~61%. (To watch Vander Aarde’s track record, click here) Overall, this stock holds a Moderate Buy rating in the Street’s consensus view, based on 3 recent reviews that include 2 Buys and 1 Hold. At $45, its average price target suggests ~72% one-year upside from the share price of $26.16. (See Avid stock forecast on TipRanks) Coinbase Global (COIN) For the last “oversold” stock we'll switch gears again and enter the newfangled realm of the crypto sphere. Coinbase is a leading cryptocurrency exchange enabling its users – both institutional and retail – to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and many others. The company is at the forefront of the crypto economy and has grown considerably since forming in 2012, when crypto was still very much the wild west. Coinbase now boasts around 98 million verified users and 13,000 institutions using its services in more than 100 countries. The company entered the public markets to much fanfare last May in what has proven to be unfortunate timing; both growth stocks and crypto coins have suffered over the past year. And Coinbase’s latest quarterly statement did not help matters either. In 1Q22, net revenue fell by 35.6% year-over to reach $1.17 billion, coming in below the Street’s forecast of $1.48 billion. Coinbase also saw a sharp drop in users and trading volume while dialing in a big miss on the bottom-line. EPS landed at -$1.98, far off the $0.91 the Street had in mind. Although the company largely stuck to its full-year 2022 outlook, to-date, Q2 trading volume has continued to trend south. As for the stock, with all these developments at play, it is now trading 81% below last November’s highs. However, believing the “long-term adoption thesis” remains intact, and considering the shares in “oversold territory,” Oppenheimer’s Owen Lau lays out the bullish case. “Despite macro challenges including inflation and supply chain constraints likely putting pressure on COIN near term, fundamentally: 1) crypto adoptions continue; 2) COIN has strong balance sheet and is able to weather the storm; and 3) COIN continues to diversify, which makes COIN an attractive long-term investment,” the analyst said. “This challenging environment is a real test to many platforms, with strong balance sheet and brand COIN is likely to be one of the consolidators… the stock appears to be oversold and could come out stronger on the other side.” Lau rates COIN shares a Buy, backed by a $197 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of a hefty 192%. (To watch Lau’s track record, click here) It’s not as if Lau’s objective is an anomaly on Wall Street; based on 14 Buys, 4 Holds and 2 Sells, the analyst consensus rates COIN a Moderate Buy. Shares are priced at $67.42, and the average price target, at $177.39, suggests it has a 163% upside potential.

5/20/2022,"The market is in full panic mode. The S&P 500 is down 18% year to date. The Nasdaq is down a staggering 27%. And even the Dow Jones — made up of the 30 most prominent publicly-traded companies — is in correction territory. According to Bank of America, there’s one thing that might save the stock market in 2022: money that corporations can return to shareholders. “The best hope for 2022 bulls lies in the ability of investors to dislodge the $7.1 trillion in idle U.S. corporate cash,” the bank writes in a note to investors. Bank of America forecasts that share repurchases and dividends in the U.S. — currently at a 12-year low — will likely go up moving forward. “We expect companies to face pressure to compete for shareholders by increasing dividends and buybacks due to low profit growth, declining productivity, and decreased prospects for profitable [capital expenditures].” In order to take advantage of a potential payout increase, Bank of America suggests ETFs that focus on dividends, buybacks, and free cash flow. Here’s a look a three to get you started. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. A lot of companies pay dividends, but some are more generous than others. If you want to invest in a portfolio of companies that are characterized by oversized payouts, consider the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF. The fund takes a passive, full replication approach to track the performance of the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index. It holds 443 stocks, so it is well diversified. The ETF’s top holdings include household names like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Procter & Gamble (PG) — companies that have been paying increasing dividends for decades. VYM also boasts a very low expense ratio of 0.06%. Paying dividends isn’t the only way to return cash to investors. Companies can also repurchase their shares. When a company buys back its stock, it reduces the number of shares outstanding, allowing each remaining investor to own a larger portion of the business. If you want to follow the buyback theme, look into the iShares U.S. Dividend and Buyback ETF. The fund tracks the Morningstar US Dividend and Buyback Index, which consists of companies with a history of dividends and share repurchases. Its expense ratio is 0.25%. Right now, DIVB holds 319 stocks, with its three top holdings being Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta Platforms (FB). In 2021, Apple spent $88.3 billion on buybacks, Microsoft spent $29.2 billion, and Meta bought back $50.1 billion of its own shares. Free cash flow represents the money a company generates after all expenses — including capital expenditures — are paid. If a company generates a lot of free cash flow, it’s typically in a good position to return cash to investors. That’s why the Pacer US Cash Cows 100 ETF is a potentially timely opportunity. The fund is based on the Pacer US Cash Cows 100 Index, which screens the Russell 1000 Index to arrive at 100 companies with the highest free cash flow yield. Currently, its top three holdings are Valero Energy (VLO), Dow (DOW), and Occidental Petroleum (OXY). The index is reconstituted and rebalanced on a quarterly basis. COWZ has an expense ratio of 0.49%.

5/20/2022,"Fear is taking over. The S&P 500 is down about 16% of its value in 2022, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has lost 26% over the same period. Investors are worried about rising interest rates, supply chain issues, and an economic slowdown. Billionaires are nervous, too. But they do have access to an asset class that has a proven track record of wealth protection: agricultural land. Here’s why the world’s wealthiest investors are buying farmland and how you can add exposure to this sector. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. Several factors make farmland a uniquely stable asset class. For one, the underlying commodity is absolutely essential. Demand for wheat, soybean, canola seeds and corn will never go away. And this year, the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe, along with protectionist policies in India, has created a global supply shock. Food prices have skyrocketed. Farmland owners benefit from this upswing. This makes it a highly effective inflation hedge — even better than most stocks and bonds. So it’s not a big surprise why billionaires have invested (heavily) in the space in recent years. Bill and Melinda Gates — prior to their divorce — accumulated roughly 270,000 acres of farmland in less than a decade. Amazon founder and chairman Jeff Bezos has amassed 420,000 acres in recent years. Other noteworthy farmland investors include Ted Turner and Thomas Peterffy. According to data published by the U.S. Agriculture Department, about 80% of rented farmland is owned by investors who do not farm themselves. This ratio could increase as more investors get involved and the barriers to entry drop. Investing in farmland directly is expensive and complicated. But retail investors can add exposure to farmland through specific publicly traded real estate investment trusts. Gladstone Land (LAND) is one of the few “pure-play” farmland REITs in the market. The company owns 112.5 million acres of farmland that is leased on a triple-net basis to farmers with excellent credit history and experience. According to the company’s latest quarterly report, its occupancy rate is 100%. Gladstone currently offers a 2.2% dividend yield. Farmland Partners (FPI) is another REIT focused on agricultural land across the U.S. The company owns 185,700 acres in 19 states and manages over 100 tenants who grow 26 major commercial crops. While the majority of the portfolio is farmland, it also owns groundwater assets and grain facilities across its properties. The stock offers a 1.7% dividend yield. Investing in farmland through these two REITs may not add much passive income to your portfolio. But they certainly have the potential to provide capital appreciation and inflation protection.

5/20/2022,"By Ross Kerber and Hyunjoo Jin (Reuters) -An S&P Dow Jones Indices executive told Reuters on Wednesday it has removed electric carmaker Tesla Inc from the widely followed S&P 500 ESG Index because of issues including claims of racial discrimination and crashes linked to its autopilot vehicles, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded with harsh tweets including that ""ESG is a scam"". In it changes, effective May 2, the sustainability index also added soon-to-be-Musk-controlled Twitter Inc and oil refiner Phillips 66 while dropping Delta Air Lines and Chevron Corp, according to an announcement. The back-and-forth over the index changes reflects a wider debate about the metrics used to judge corporate performance on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, a growing area of investing. Tesla has become the most valuable auto industry company by pioneering EVs and expanding into battery storage for electric grids and solar-power systems. Factors contributing to its departure from the index included Tesla's lack of published details related to its low carbon strategy or business conduct codes, said Margaret Dorn, S&P Dow Jones Indices' head of ESG indices for North America, in an interview. Even though Tesla's products help cut planet-warming emissions, Dorn said, its other issues and lack of disclosures relative to industry peers should raise concerns for investors looking to judge the company across environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. ""You can't just take a company's mission statement at face value, you have to look at their practices across all those key dimensions,"" she said. Tesla representatives did not immediately respond to questions. The company has previously called ESG methodologies ""fundamentally flawed."" Musk tweeted https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1526958110023245829 that ""Exxon is rated top ten best in world for environment, social & governance (ESG) by S&P 500, while Tesla didn’t make the list! ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors."" Asked about the tweet, a representative for the index provider said Musk may have been referring to a list on a company blog post https://www.indexologyblog.com/2022/05/17/the-rebalancing-act-of-the-sp-500-esg-index of the largest 10 constituents by market cap of the S&P 500 ESG Index after the removal of Tesla and others. The list is ""not a ranking of best companies by ESG score,"" the representative said. Exxon now accounts for 1.443% of the weight of the index. Apple Inc was the largest at 9.657%. GROWING CONCERNS Investors concerned about issues like diversity and climate change have poured billions of dollars into funds using ESG criteria to pick stocks, prompting debate about how effectively the funds promote change or whether they push companies too much on issues that should be settled by government policy. S&P Dow Jones Indices is majority-owned by S&P Global Inc. Musk and others have complained the firm and its rivals conflate too many issues by bundling ESG concerns into one total score. For instance a fund based on the S&P 500 ESG Index, the SPDR S&P 500 ESG ETF, received the low rating ""D"" by climate activist research group As You Sow, which noted despite its title and sustainability mandate, fossil fuel stocks make up 6.5% of fund assets. In the company blog post reviewing changes from April 22, S&P's Dorn said the index aims to keep industries weighted the same as they are in the regular S&P 500 index ""while enhancing the overall sustainability profile of the index."" In practice that means it can keep oil companies while leaving out big players like Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Wells Fargo & Co. Dorn said Tesla's ESG score had declined slightly from the ""22"" it received last year. At the same time the average score among other automakers improved, pushing Tesla out of the ESG index because of a rule against including lowest-quartile performers. Dorn and others did not immediately describe other details such as the reasons Twitter or Phillips 66 were added or other companies dropped. Among other big ESG ratings agencies, MSCI Inc gives Tesla an ""average"" ESG rating, while the Sustainalytics unit of Morningstar Inc gives Tesla a ""medium risk"" rating, according to the firms' websites. On Wednesday a U.S. safety regulator opened a special crash investigation into a Tesla crash this month in California, among more than 30 crashes under investigation involving advanced driver assistance systems. [nL2N2XA2CY] In February, a California state agency sued Tesla over allegations by Black workers that the company tolerated racial discrimination at an assembly plant, adding to claims made in several other lawsuits.

5/20/2022,"Bitcoin is on a wild ride. The world’s largest cryptocurrency soared to $68,990 last November. Now, it’s at around $29,000 — a staggering 58% pullback from the peak. If the downtrend continues, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki says he’s ready to start buying. “BITCOIN CRASHING. Great news,” he tweeted last week. “I am waiting for Bitcoin to crash to 20k. Will then wait for test of bottom which might be $17k. Once I know bottom is in I back up the truck. Crashes are the best times to get rich.” Kiyosaki added that bitcoin “is the future of money” and that its bottom may be even lower at $11,000. In today’s market environment, it’s not easy to be a contrarian investor. But if you share Kiyosaki’s view, here are three simple ways to capitalize on bitcoin's potential rebound. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. The first option is the most straightforward: If you want to buy bitcoin, just buy bitcoin. These days, many platforms allow individual investors to buy and sell crypto. Just be aware that some exchanges charge up to 4% in commission fees for each transaction. So look for apps that charge low or even no commissions. While bitcoin commands a five-figure price tag today, there’s no need to buy a whole coin. Most exchanges allow you to start with as much money as you are willing to spend. Exchange-traded funds have risen in popularity in recent years. They trade on stock exchanges, so it’s very convenient to buy and sell them. And now, investors can use them to get a piece of the bitcoin action, too. For instance, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) started trading on NYSE Arca in October 2021, marking the first U.S. bitcoin-linked ETF on the market. The fund holds bitcoin futures contracts that trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and has an expense ratio of 0.95%. There’s also the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), which made its debut a few days after BITO. This Nasdaq-listed ETF invests in bitcoin futures contracts, and charges an expense ratio of 0.95%. When companies tie some of their growth to the crypto market, their shares can often move in tandem with the coins. First, we have bitcoin miners. The computing power doesn’t come cheap and energy costs can be substantial. But if the price of bitcoin goes up, miners such as Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Hut 8 Mining (HUT) will likely receive growing attention from investors. Then there are intermediaries like Coinbase Global (COIN) and Paypal (PYPL). When more people buy, sell, and use crypto, these platforms stand to benefit. Finally, there are companies that simply hold a lot of crypto on their balance sheets. Case in point: enterprise software technologist MicroStrategy (MSTR). It has a market cap of $2.3 billion.
