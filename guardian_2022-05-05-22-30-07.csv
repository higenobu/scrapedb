5/5/2022,"Twenty-two paintings by the influential post-impressionist painter Paul Cézanne that have never before been seen in the UK will go on show in a “once in a generation exhibition” at Tate Modern in the autumn. They include the acclaimed Still Life with Fruit Dish, on loan from the Museum of Modern Art in New York, which confirmed Cézanne’s reputation as one of the most important modern European artists. Altogether, 80 paintings, watercolours and drawings will trace the life and work of a “pivotal figure in the direction of modern art”, said Frances Morris, Tate Modern’s director. But she warned that the high cost of mounting major exhibitions meant Tate was forced to be “very selective” about such shows, and to seek partners to share the financial burden. The Cézanne exhibition, which includes works from Europe, Asia and the Americas, is being put on in partnership with EY. The standard ticket price will be £22 compared with £18 for most pre-pandemic blockbuster shows, although discounts will be available for young people. The price was in “recognition that [such exhibitions are] extremely cost-intensive”, Morris said. Still Life with Fruit Dish was once owned by Paul Gauguin, who painted it in the background of his own painting Woman in Front of a Still Life by Cézanne. Gauguin described Cézanne’s painting as “an exceptional pearl, the apple of my eye”, but he was forced to sell it to pay medical bills. The exhibition opens with one of the earliest self-portraits painted by the artist, an image of “a sophisticated man about to conquer the capital” as he prepared to leave his home in Provence for Paris, said Natalia Sidlina, curator of international art at Tate Modern. It charts the events, places and relationships that shaped the work of “one of the most highly regarded and enigmatic artists of the late 19th century”, she added. “Cézanne witnessed swift political and social changes in France [as] it alternated between the Republic to empire and back to the Republic, the shock of the social unrest of the Paris Commune, and later in life the city-dividing Dreyfus Affair.” The artist distanced himself from the Paris art scene and Impressionism, returning to Provence to pursue his own style. One room of the exhibition will be devoted to his paintings of the limestone mountain of Sainte-Victoire, including one from the Philadelphia Museum not seen in the UK before. Another room will bring together several of Cezanne’s acclaimed bather paintings, including one of his largest and most celebrated works, Bathers 1894-1905. Portraits of his wife Hortense and son Paul will also feature in the exhibition. A century ago, Tate rejected first offers of gifts of paintings by Cezanne as “too modern”, said Morris. “But only a few years later, Samuel Courtauld, an inspirational and transformative trustee of Tate, established a fund cleverly specifying what artists could be acquired for the national collection, and Cezanne was one of those artists. “So Tate then became the very first national public museum in the UK to possess Cezanne paintings in 1924. And since then Cezanne has really been a key part of our holdings.” The EY Exhibition: Cezanne opens on 6 October until 12 March 2023.",Arts/Art and design,Paul Cézanne paintings never seen in UK to go on show at Tate Modern,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/05/paul-cezanne-paintings-tate-modern
5/5/2022,"Russia has unleashed heavy artillery barrages against multiple Ukrainian positions in the south and east of the country, amid conflicting claims over whether Russian forces were attempting to storm the last Ukrainian positions in the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. While Ukrainian officials and fighters claimed Russian troops had entered the labyrinthine industrial area in the southern city and that heavy fighting was taking place inside, the Kremlin denied its troops had entered and said humanitarian corridors to evacuate trapped civilians were operating there on Thursday. Ukrainian fighters inside Azovstal said they were fighting “difficult, bloody battles” inside the plant, according to Denys Prokopenko, commander of the Azov regiment. Ukraine’s military general staff said the assault on the plant had air support, and pictures released by Russian-backed fighters appeared to show smoke and flames enveloping it. However, asked to comment on the claim that Russian troops had broken into the plant’s territory, the official Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, referred reporters to president Vladimir Putin’s previous order not to storm the plant. Asked about a New York Times report that US intelligence helped Ukraine kill a number of Russian generals, Peskov said: “The United States, Britain, Nato, as a whole hand over intelligence ... to Ukraine’s armed forces on a permanent basis. “Coupled with the flow of weapons that these countries are sending to Ukraine, these are all actions that do not contribute to the quick completion of the operation,” he said. Peskov’s comments came as Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said civilians would need to be dug from bunkers under the steelworks which is littered with concrete debris. Ukrainian officials believe that about 200 civilians remain trapped along with fighters in the network of underground bunkers at the sprawling Soviet-era complex. Having failed to capture the capital, Kyiv, in the early weeks of an invasion that has killed thousands and flattened towns and villages, Russia has accelerated attacks in southern and eastern Ukraine. Putin called off plans for an assault on the plant last month, telling his defence minister to seal it off instead. Russia’s defence ministry added on Thursday that its artillery had struck multiple Ukrainian positions and strongholds overnight, claiming it had killed 600 fighters. The defence ministry also said its missiles destroyed aviation equipment at the Kanatovo airfield in Ukraine’s central Kirovohrad region and a large ammunition depot in the southern city of Mykolaiv. The Russian claims of Ukrainian fatalities in the hundreds were impossible to verify and reflect statements by both Ukrainian and Russian officials in recent days, both claiming heavy enemy losses. Ukraine and Russia have both said that fighting had been heavy across the south and east over the past day. While it is difficult to assess accurate casualty numbers, senior western officials who have briefed journalists recently suggested that Russian losses may have declined somewhat since the heavy casualties incurred during the failed campaign to take Kyiv. There are also suggestions that Ukrainian losses may be mounting under intense Russian artillery bombardments that have marked Moscow’s conduct of the latest phase of the war. With Ukraine’s western allies rushing to supply Kyiv with artillery systems and shells to counter Russia’s, the conflict in Ukraine appears to be turning into a grinding artillery duel between the two sides, with Russian advances limited to a small number of kilometres each day. Despite claims of Ukrainian counteroffensives in the east, these appear to have been limited in scope, with an adviser to Zelenskiy having said that Ukraine was unlikely to launch a significant counteroffensive before mid-June, when it hopes to have received more weapons from its allies. While senior western officials have spoken openly about their desire to leave Russia “weakened” by its invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin on Thursday accused the west of preventing a “quick” end to Russia’s military campaign. The wives of at least two Ukrainian soldiers inside Azovstal have been in Rome, pleading with the international community for an evacuation of the soldiers there, arguing they deserve the same rights as civilians. Kateryna Prokopenko, the wife of the Ukrainian commander at the plant, said she gone without word from him for more than 36 hours before finally hearing from him Wednesday.Should the Azovstal fighters be taken captive, it’s not clear whether Russia would uphold its commitments under international law regarding prisoners of war, given its alleged previous violations of rules governing wartime conduct and a lack of evidence of its treatment of captured Ukrainian troops.",News/World news,Russia opens artillery barrages in south and east Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/russia-opens-artillery-barrages-in-south-and-east-ukraine
5/5/2022,"On the evening of 17 February 2021, Gabriel Bringye kissed his fiancee goodbye, and assured her he wouldn’t work late. Hours later, police were at the door of their east London home. He had been killed on the job, lured by a group of teenagers who booked his car on the Bolt cab ride app in order to rob him. Known as a “trap job”, the group used a stolen phone to book the journey that ended with the 37-year-old driver’s death. Despite his vehicle remaining stationary for nearly six hours while booked on a job, Bolt had no automated system in place to raise the alarm; Gabriel was found by a passerby. He died at the scene. More than a year since his death, Gabriel’s sister Renata Bringye and his fiancee, Mara Fazecas, are leading the fight to promote driver safety and prevent more attacks on drivers. In a campaign with the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), Renata, who also works as a private hire driver, and Fazecas, a hotel cleaning supervisor, are demanding Bolt implements better safety measures. They also want the multibillion dollar company to give its drivers worker status, as Uber was forced to do last year. Renata, 35, remembers her older brother as a family man: “He never had a problem with anyone. If anybody needed something, he was the first who jumped to help.” The Romanian national, who had been working as a driver for five years at the time of his death, lived with his fiancee, his sister and her nine-year-old son in Walthamstow, after moving to London from Spain more than a decade ago. After working in construction, Gabriel became a private-hire driver, attracted by the flexibility it offered. He enjoyed driving, and choosing his own hours meant he could help his sister take care of her son. Her brother’s death left Renata shaken, and she deleted the Bolt app from her phone. “I don’t want it to happen to me as well, because I have my little son to bring up,” she says. Gabriel’s killers, aged 18 and 19, were found guilty of manslaughter at the Old Bailey in mid-March, with the prosecution arguing the killing had been a consequence of a plan to rob a driver. Since Gabriel’s death, other Bolt drivers have been brutally attacked and robbed. Just weeks after the incident, Muhammad Alam was punched in the face and had his car stolen at knifepoint in east London; Garad Hussein was left unable to walk and needing multiple operations after an attack in Birmingham last December. Bolt introduced welfare checks on static vehicles after Gabriel’s killing, a change that IWGB president Alex Marshall credits to the pressure of their campaigning: if a car remains stationary for an unexplained reason, the company’s safety team will contact the driver and passenger, and then the police if neither responds. But Gabriel and Fazecas are pushing for more comprehensive protections. Alongside customer photo requirements, vehicle partitions and CCTV in the vehicle, they are calling for the app to introduce password protection. To 37-year-old Fazecas, this is critical, as Gabriel was ambushed by a group who booked the trip on a stolen phone. “If they had a login password, so they couldn’t make a trap trip, Gabriel would still be alive today.” The campaign has been pushing for Bolt to implement better protection measures for drivers by writing letters that outline their demands, protesting outside the company headquarters and holding a vigil and rally on the anniversary of Gabriel’s death. It was at this last event that the campaign was officially launched, with Nader Awaad, chair of the IWGB’s United Private Hire Drivers branch saying: “Every driver deserves to feel safe in their place of work, but a year since Gabriel’s tragic [killing] the threat of abuse, harassment and violence is still a daily part of the job.” While the campaign’s demands are primarily directed at Bolt, Marshall says he is “hoping for a domino effect” for workers throughout the gig economy. Worker status is integral to driver safety, he argues: the precarity of the gig economy often pushes drivers into taking on jobs they may feel uneasy about due to reasons such as a customer having a low rating or feeling unsafe working at night. Employment rights allow drivers to “make basic risk assessments”, he says: “When you’re constantly being underpaid, you’re constantly working to try and hit targets … It might get to a point where you think, ‘I don’t really like the look of this job, I haven’t made enough today, so I probably should take this job just to make a few more quid.’” Bolt says that it has increased the rates it charges to passengers and, as such, Bolt drivers are now making 22% more per mile than they were making in January 2020. Renata was all too familiar with making difficult decisions about which jobs to take, particularly as a female driver – and she says Bolt penalised her for turning down jobs. She claims she was repeatedly suspended from the app after her acceptance rate slipped below the company’s minimum threshold, due to rejecting passengers with low ratings – a story similar to that of Andrei Donisa, who brought a case in 2020 over the issue. Bolt says it has since scrapped its acceptance rate policy. Renata points out another imbalance: while drivers must maintain a minimum rating of 4.0 to work for the app, there appears to be no equivalent requirement for passengers. As well as an absence of partition barriers, there are other factors that may place gig economy drivers at higher risk of attacks than black cab drivers, Marshall argues. In London, about 90% of black cab drivers are white British while 94% of private hire drivers are BAME, and he says racism can play a role in sparking assaults against some immigrant drivers: “If English isn’t your first language, that’s a point of contention for some passengers.” He also believes the perception of how minicab drivers are treated by the firms they work for affects their treatment by the public. “Companies hire and fire them at the click of a button, they have zero responsibility if a violent incident happens – people just think: ‘I can treat these guys as I want, because what’s going to happen?’” He compares this to how black cab drivers are often perceived: “They’re part of London’s fibre, they’re a tourist attraction, they’re on postcards.” After Gabriel’s death, his family received a bouquet of flowers from Bolt and a voicemail message from a company representative; they are upset that the company subsequently claimed in press statements to have been supporting them. Gareth Taylor, regional manager for the UK and Ireland at Bolt, said: “Bolt condemns violence of any form directed towards private-hire drivers, who we believe have the right to earn a living without risk of harm, intimidation, coercion, or fear of death or injury. The death of Gabriel Bringye was a shocking and senseless tragedy. Our subsequent response and communication with his family was not conducted to the standard that is expected and we are truly sorry.” Taylor said he intended to meet with Gabriel’s family within the next few weeks to convey his condolences and discuss their campaign’s demands. In addition to checks on static vehicles, Taylor said Bolt has also set up a round-the-clock support line and “significantly” increased its safety team, who handle safety related incidents, including conducting welfare checks. Taylor said the safety team is also working to ban passengers with consistently poor feedback, and is implementing a system preventing drivers and passengers who have previously rated each other poorly from being reconnected. “We are dedicated to making our platform as safe as possible for drivers and passengers and we have a range of safety improvements planned over the coming year,” he said. In a gesture of solidarity with the family, several drivers accompanied the family to Kent when they took Gabriel’s body home to Romania last year via the Channel. But Fazecas has been unable to feel settled anywhere since her partner’s death. “I always felt at home with him. I realised after he died, home is not a place – it’s a feeling you have with the person you love. “Gabriel was young, he was full of dreams. We wanted to start a family. I want to do this [campaign] in memory of Gabriel – I don’t want his life to go away and nothing to change.”",News/Society,‘The threat of abuse and violence is still a daily part of the job’: the bereaved women fighting to protect gig economy drivers,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/05/abuse-violence-protect-gig-economy-drivers
5/5/2022,"Back in 2011, Mandip Gill was an aspiring actor who had dabbled in theatre and was struggling to break into TV. Down on her luck, she took a notebook and drew a picture of a cheque for £5,000. A few weeks later, she was offered a part on Hollyoaks. She’s convinced she managed to manifest her breakthrough role on Channel 4’s teen soap. “In my head, the only way I was getting paid was from acting,” she confides as we sit down by the Thames in Canary Wharf, London, gleaming skyscrapers everywhere. She still has that notebook, now crammed with other goals, each one ticked off.One of those was to play a police officer, which she managed in 2018 – though not in the way you might have expected. As Yasmin Khan, probationary officer from Sheffield and one of the faithful companions in Doctor Who, she has battled giant spiders, Cybermen and Daleks alongside Jodie Whittaker’s Time Lord. That’s all going to end later this year in an autumn special that will celebrate 100 years of the BBC. Gill will be leaving, too, when Whittaker finally bows out. “It’s been the best experience,” she says. “I had the time of my life.” It’s a mild spring evening, but Gill is dressed in a black hoodie, black flared trousers and a furry black and brown coat that looks like a cosy draughts board. She is makeup free, a gold stud in her nose. The 34-year-old actor, who was born in Leeds to a Sikh family, has an infectious warmth that draws you in like a hug. She is fun and feisty, chatting a mile a minute, racing to get her thoughts out. We’re meeting a few days before Doctor Who’s Easter special airs. In Legend of the Sea Devils, the Doctor finally tells a lovestruck Yaz that she reciprocates her feelings, although things are left up in the air for Thasmin (as fans have nicknamed the couple). It’s the first time the Doctor has been involved in a same-sex romance. “I’m happy with where it heads,” says Gill of their flirty heart-to-heart. “It got there naturally. It’s beautiful and full of authenticity.” As the outgoing companion and the troubled tearaway Phoebe McQueen on Hollyoaks, Gill has made a name for herself playing characters who are gutsy and independent. Yaz has been a brave, determined and loyal sidekick, while fearless Phoebe overcame homelessness, lashed out at bullies and escaped from human traffickers before she was tragically murdered by the notorious Gloved Hand Killer. The actor has also showed off her range as a young widow in ITV medical drama The Good Karma Hospital and as a pregnant refugee in the gritty British drama The Flood. Her latest role is the lead in a new production of 2:22 A Ghost Story. She plays Jenny, a sleep-deprived new mother, who is convinced the house she has bought with her husband (Harry Potter’s Tom Felton in his West End debut) is haunted. It’s the fourth day of rehearsals for Danny Robins’s supernatural thriller. Director Matthew Dunster asked the cast to do circuit training in the morning, a rather novel way of limbering them up to perform. Gill will be taking over from the singer Lily Allen and I’m a Celebrity … winner and author Giovanna Fletcher, who played Jenny in previous runs of the show. “It’s scary because you will naturally get compared with them,” Gill says. While her predecessors are mothers in real life, she is not. “I don’t have kids, so I’m really having to dig deep to find out what that would feel like. “Jenny is so different from what I’ve been playing on Doctor Who. I feel like I needed to start choosing characters that were closer to my actual age. I’d been playing kids or [women in their] young 20s for a long time. She felt really mature, complicated and interesting.” Gill grew up on a council estate, where her parents owned a newsagent. “It was hard. There were very few Asian people. We all had to work in the shop. You’re very exposed when you’re doing something like that.” Her mother and father had to deal with “altercations all the time”. Witnessing that on a regular basis shaped her. “I stand up for myself,” she says firmly. Evidence of a love of performing came early. Her father would film her and her siblings when they were kids, dancing and singing Hindi songs. Gill cackles remembering a comedy show she did as a three-year-old. “I was so annoying!” When she was six, she dressed up as Scary Spice and announced to her family: “I’m gonna be on telly.” When Gill auditioned for Doctor Who, she wasn’t initially told what show it was for. All she knew was there was lots of sci-fi jargon required. “I was like, OK, they’re either doing a new show or it’s Doctor Who. I never thought I’d do something like that. It almost felt like it was a step above me.”In the years since Gill got the role, Whittaker has become one of her best mates – though nothing more. “A long time ago, me and Jodie were holding hands, and that started a little bit of a rumour,” she says. “We’re so touchy-feely as friends. As me and Jodie have found each other, our characters are at the same time.”Since Whittaker took over as the first ever female Doctor in 2018, the series has faced accusations of being too “politically correct”. Gill was cast alongside Tosin Cole, who played Ryan Sinclair, meaning the Doctor had both Asian and Black companions. The revamped show also featured storylines about Rosa Parks and the partition of India, prompting outraged viewers to complain on Twitter using the hashtag #notmydoctor.“I don’t really know how we can be politically correct,” Gill argues, “because it’s just correct. There are Asian and Black people living in Sheffield. We’re not something that [showrunner Chris Chibnall] created.” Gill has seen how important it is for the show to be as inclusive as possible. For the past few months, young fans have been approaching her to share how they’ve come out to their parents after seeing Yaz struggling with her sexuality.“I’ve welled up so many times,” she says. “I’m like, a television programme helped you. It’s really important to see yourself being represented. People need to learn about other communities, races, religions.” Gill watched the BBC’s British Asian sketch show Goodness Gracious Me and comedy film East Is East as a child. “We held on to them dearly because we were seeing ourselves and our families.” Gill takes pride in the record-breaking success of Bridgerton’s second series, which focuses on the love lives of two Indian sisters, played by Simone Ashley and Charithra Chandran. The actors “are doing so much in changing the stereotypes of south Asians. There’s been an emphasis on them being dark-skinned girls – that’s a massive gear shift that needed to happen … I still have conversations where I’m like: ‘I never had a chance as a brown woman,’” she sighs.Those doubts aside, Gill is excited about moving on to the next stage of her career, after wrapping filming on her final Doctor Who episodes in October. Before she left, she also shot Suspicion, an Apple TV+ thriller starring Uma Thurman that was released earlier this year. “It was eye-opening because I’d had this really easy time on Doctor Who. Not saying [Suspicion] wasn’t fun, but they had a shorter time to create something. I was like, arggghh,” she screeches. “It was scary.”It hasn’t been plain sailing since she left the BBC show, she points out. “I’ve had a few months of nos: it’s not worked out or I haven’t resonated with a project.” It’s an experience that she is all too familiar with after her time on Hollyoaks came to an end in 2015. It took her a year and a half before she landed the part in Doctor Who. “Learning that quite early on in my career was handy for me, because now I’m just like, that’s the way it goes. No matter what you’ve been on, you still have to work really hard.”After 2:22 – A Ghost Story finishes its run, she’ll be back auditioning, ready to embrace whatever the universe has in store for her. Gill has plenty of new goals that she’s trying to manifest. “I would like to do a Marvel film. I’d like to challenge myself and put on all these amazing costumes and work on epic sets. But what I’d really like to do is work on independent films made with grit and heart.” Time to start scribbling in that notebook. 2:22 – A Ghost Story is at the Criterion theatre, London, from 7 May to 4 September.",Arts/Stage,Mandip Gill: ‘Me and Jodie Whittaker are so touchy-feely’,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/05/mandip-gill-doctor-who-ghost-story-interview
5/5/2022,"Unemployment rising. Inflation above 10%. Energy prices soaring. Living standards squeezed. The message from the Bank of England was crystal clear: the 1970s are back. The word stagflation was not to be found in the 100-plus pages of Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy report. Yet a period of weak growth and rapidly rising prices is precisely what the Bank says is in store for the UK. The current post-lockdown bounce will be short-lived and, in a real blast from the past, the economy will be driven into recession to bring inflation under control. Nor is the pain likely to be over quickly. The economy is expected to contract by 0.25% in 2023 and remain weak in the next two years. The next general election will take place against a backdrop of weak growth and lengthening dole queues. Just as in the 1970s, the Bank says external factors are mainly to blame. In 1973, it was the Yom Kippur war that led to 25% inflation by mid-1975. This time it is the war in Ukraine. The Bank is pencilling in another 40% increase in the energy price cap in October, taking the average annual household bill to £2,800. There may be arguments about whether the UK is technically heading for recession because the Bank is not forecasting two consecutive quarters of falling output – but it will certainly feel like it. Living standards are about to take their biggest hit in decades. Six months ago, the Bank thought inflation would peak at 5%. It now believes it will top out at just over 10%, easily the highest level since Threadneedle Street was granted operational independence 25 years ago. The Bank says there is little it can do to prevent the harm to household budgets and company profit margins caused by rising global energy profits, and that its task is to hit the government’s 2% inflation target while minimising the damage to the economy. Confronted with the dilemma of whether to worry more about the risks of recession or of inflation becoming embedded, the Bank has opted for a middle course, raising interest rates by a quarter point to 1% – their highest level since early 2009. But the vote was not unanimous: three of the nine members of the monetary policy committee wanted a half-point increase. Having been too optimistic about the economy in the past, the Bank may now be too gloomy. There are two reasons for that. The first is that Threadneedle Street’s forecasts are based on what the financial markets think will happen to interest rates – and given the prospect of prolonged stagnation, the current City belief that borrowing costs will peak at 2.5% looks much too high. Some members of the MPC think no further tightening will be needed. The second reason is that it is hard to envisage the government watching the economy slide into recession without doing something to alleviate the pain. The Bank has upped the pressure on Rishi Sunak to act – and act big.",News/Business,Recession the price Bank prepared to pay to bring UK inflation to heel,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/05/recession-the-price-bank-prepared-to-pay-to-bring-uk-inflation-to-heel

Manufacturers of HRT products and pharmacy representatives met Sajid Javid and the recently appointed HRT supply tsar, Madeleine McTernan, on Thursday to discuss the supply shortages. The meeting lasted about an hour, and Javid was expected to release a statement on the discussions later in the day. Javid tweeted after the meeting: I want every woman who needs HRT to receive it quickly & without hassle.Today I met with manufacturers & pharmacists to understand how they're boosting supply and how we can better work together to meet demand. pic.twitter.com/NNcwLIslTm Soaring demand for HRT products among British women going through menopause has led to months of supply shortages and stories of women struggling to sleep or work effectively after being unable to obtain their prescriptions. Some describe the surge in demand as the “Davina effect” after a documentary fronted by the TV presenter – Davina McCall: Sex, Myths and the Menopause – that was broadcast on Channel 4 in May last year prompted thousands to seek prescriptions. Javid has rationed supply, imposing “serious shortage protocols” on 29 April to limit the dispensing of Oestrogel, Ovestin cream and Premique Low Dose to three months’ supply per person to “even out” the distribution. Millions of women go through the menopause each year, and many experience a range of symptoms which can be severe, including anxiety, low mood, hot flushes and difficulties sleeping. The government knew about the supply shortages as far back as October, according to Tina Backhouse, the UK manager for women’s health at Theramex, a pharmaceuticals firm.

5/5/2022,"Anthony Albanese has bemoaned the fact the 2022 campaign is more focussed on “soundbites rather than philosophies and values” – a trend he says is alienating Australian voters and boosting support for political disrupters. The Labor leader appeared solo on the ABC’s Q&A program on Thursday night to field questions from the audience, while Scott Morrison fronted another program on Sky News at the same time. On the hustings earlier on Thursday, the Labor leader was initially unable to name the six points of his party’s plan to improve the national disability insurance scheme, and was later handed briefing notes by an advisor. The Q&A host David Speers raised that incident with the Labor leader. Albanese said elections should not be “some bureaucratic gotcha game”. “The point here is [about] putting people back in charge of the NDIS and at the centre of it – and one of the things I reckon that really alienates people from the political system completely is this idea that politics is about a sort of series of gotchas and game-playing,” the Labor leader said. Albanese said what was important was not reciting a list but understanding the impact of the scheme on people’s lives. He said he understood the value of government assistance, having lacked a support program like the NDIS when helping to care for his mother, a chronic rheumatoid arthritis sufferer, during his childhood, when she “couldn’t use a knife and fork, she had crippled hands, [and] feet”. The Labor leader returned to that theme in a question from a voter who identified herself as a “new Australian” who was about to vote in a federal election for the first time. The questioner noted the significant number of independent candidates running in the 2022 election and asked whether or not this trend underscored voter dissatisfaction with the major parties. Albanese said he had been born “as a believer with three great faiths – the Catholic Church, the South Sydney rugby league football club and the Australian Labor party”. But Australian society had become less tribal and more “disparate”. He noted political discourse had changed. “Even the way that this election is being conducted, you know, you get down to sound bites rather than philosophies and values of driving issues forward, you know?” “And that, I think, is helping to alienate people, helping to divide people into camps,” he said. “I think social media can be problematic.” Albanese acknowledged the major parties had also alienated some of their supporters by indulging in leadership instability for the better part of a decade. “I think the chopping and changing of leaders that we had, both sides were guilty of that, [and] left open alienation on those issues.” The Labor leader said in some areas, the Australian parliament didn’t function optimally. He said he believed there had been a majority of parliamentarians in the House of Representatives and the Senate “since at least 2007” that favoured serious action on the climate crisis. Labor legislated a carbon price during the period of the Gillard government but then that progress “got unwound”. In an interview on Sky News, broadcast at the same time Albanese appeared on Q&A, Morrison seized on the Labor leader’s earlier inability to immediately detail his party’s NDIS plan. “I would’ve thought this deep into the campaign, they would have had some clear plans and the few plans that they have he’d know what they are,” Morrison said. “It is a choice and people are looking and they’re going, ‘I can’t see it in this guy, I can’t see it in that other guy from Labor, I can’t see it in Anthony Albanese’.” Morrison claimed Albanese had been left lacking on the detail of key policy areas. A recent attack line from Morrison has alleged that Labor policies on aged care and housing had “fallen apart” within days of announcement. “I know that not everybody agrees with everything I’ve done… But they do know I think things through, they do know I work diligently on the policy detail,” the PM said. “They do know that I seek to fully understand the problems I’m seeking to solve.” Morrison – who also faced combative questioning on the hustings on Thursday – has thus far declined to be interviewed by the ABC on any major television current affairs program during the campaign, and did not respond to an invitation from the ABC to conduct a leaders debate on the national broadcaster.",News/Australia news,Anthony Albanese bemoans campaign focus on ‘soundbites rather than values’ after forgetting NDIS detail,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/05/anthony-albanese-bemoans-campaign-focus-on-soundbites-rather-than-values-after-forgetting-ndis-detail
5/5/2022,"The European Union plans to impose sanctions on the head of the Russian Orthodox church, Patriarch Kirill, a long-serving Kremlin ally who has given his blessing to the war in Ukraine, according to a draft document seen by the Guardian. Kirill, who used a sermon to support Russia’s “special peacekeeping operation” days after the invasion, now faces being added to the EU sanctions list, which already includes more than 1,000 powerful Russians, according to the draft. He is one of 57 people who would face an EU travel ban and asset freeze under new listings being discussed by member states. EU officials are also targeting the immediate family of Vladimir Putin’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, who was sanctioned in a previous round. Peskov’s wife, Tatiana Navka, would be added to the list through her marriage, but also because of her co-ownership of property in Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, according to the EU. Nikolay Peskov, 31, is said by the EU to use his father’s money, while Elizaveta Peskova, 24, is said to have acquired “lucrative positions and has been living a luxurious lifestyle thanks to her father’s connections”. The day after the Russian invasion, Peskova posted “No to war” on her Instagram account, according to Russian media. The post was later removed. Also expected to be added to the list is Marina Mordashova, the wife of Russia’s richest man, Alexei Mordashov, because she is said to benefit from her husband’s assets. He is a majority shareholder of Severstal, Russia’s biggest steel company, and during the pandemic rescued Tui, Europe’s largest tour operator. After Mordashov was added to the EU sanctions list in March, German authorities reported that he had transferred €1.5bn worth of shares in Tui and the gold company Nordgold to his wife via various offshore companies. The EU is also targeting several dozen military officers accused of the murder and torture of civilians in the town of Bucha, near Kyiv. Heading the list is Azatbek Omurbekov, the commander of the 64th separate motor rifle brigade of the 35th army. He is described on the EU sanctions list as “leading the actions of his military unit and nicknamed ‘butcher of Bucha’, due to his direct responsibility in killings, rapes and torture”. Also on the draft list is the head of Russia’s national defence management centre, Mikhail Mizintsev, the military commander said to be responsible for the siege of Mariupol that has killed thousands of people. He is accused of orchestrating the bombardment of the strategic port city, including the bombings of a maternity hospital and a theatre, an atrocity that killed hundreds of people, including children, who were sheltering there. A handful of Ukrainians are also on the list, notably officials who the EU says have worked with Russians in the occupied cities of Kherson and Melitopol. Kirill is named on the draft EU sanctions list under his birth name, Vladimir Gundyayev and described as “one of the most prominent supporters of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine”. The patriarch has claimed Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine needed to be “liberated” and called the war a “religious cleansing operation”. After Putin won a fraudulent election in 2012, Kirill described his return to the presidency as a “miracle of God”. The patriarch’s support for the war has led to a clash with the pope, who urged Kirill earlier this week not to “be Putin’s altar boy”. The EU intends to add 16 firms to the sanctions list, notably Russian companies that make aircraft, vehicles, parts and other technology used in war. Under the plans, three Russian media companies, RTR, Russia-24 and TV Centre International, are to have their broadcasting licences revoked in the EU for being “instrumental in bringing forward and supporting the aggression against Ukraine” and “the destabilisation of its neighbouring countries”. Three banks, including Russia’s largest lender, Sberbank, are to be banned from using the Swift international bank messaging system, effectively stopping them from doing business with the west. The list of names still has to be approved by the EU’s 27 member states, who are discussing a ban on Russian oil imports by the end of the year. Hungary and Slovakia, two countries that are nearly 100% dependent on Russian crude oil, have been offered a one-year extension on the ban. Budapest has said it cannot support the sanctions in their current form, while Bratislava says it needs more time to overhaul its refineries. Meanwhile, Greece and Cyprus have said they have concerns about a plan to ban EU-flagged ships from transporting Russian crude oil to other countries that have not imposed sanctions on Russia. Insurers would also be unable to underwrite the journeys against the risk of accidents. Many other service companies, including tax consultants, PR firms and accountants, would be banned from doing business with Russia. Despite the disagreements on the oil embargo, diplomats remain confident that an agreement can be reached by Friday or over the weekend.",News/World news,Head of Russian Orthodox church on EU sanctions list draft,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/head-of-russian-orthodox-church-patriarch-kirill-eu-sanctions-list-draft
5/5/2022,"A crash course in To Pimp a Butterfly’s expansive sound – Thundercat’s bass ricochets around, George Clinton is on hand to bolster the P-funk-like chorus – and its lyrical viewpoint. It starts out like the standard bling-dripping, screw-you rapper’s victory lap, but suddenly flips into a troubled disquisition on materialism as a form of control. Lamar has had a fractious relationship with Drake over the years – there are umpteen articles online picking apart their apparent lyrical references to each other – but all was harmonious on the standout collaboration from the LP Good Kid, MAAD City, replete with its fantastic Janet-Jackson-sampling beat. DNA is Lamar in virtuosic form: a firework display of his technical ability as a rapper, shifting restlessly between viewpoints as he examines black identity. He apparently told the producer, Mike Will Made It, to make the backing sound “like chaos”; he responded with a patchwork of electronic noise and samples from Fox News – and of Rick James demanding drugs. Dropped from Good Kid, MAAD City and subsequently released as a single, the dark, Wu-Tang-goes-trap beat of Cartoon and Cereal improbably paired Lamar with the Rick-Ross-affiliated, swastika-tattooed rapper Gunplay. The directness of the latter’s verse is a perfect complement to the unpick-this density of Lamar’s lyrics. From Lamar’s debut album, a swaggering early example of his skills. Rapping in a double-time flow over a twitchy, sped-up jazz sample, he offers a stream of boasts about his ability that are so relentless and inventive, even Nas – one of the artists over whom Rigamortus appears to claim Lamar’s supremacy – called him “the future”. Apparently Lamar’s favourite track from To Pimp a Butterfly, on which he gradually pulls himself out of depression into a state close to euphoria, buoyed up by a backing based on the Isley Brothers’ reliably joy-bringing That Lady. “What you gonna do?” he asks after detailing a litany of life’s horrors. “Lift up your head and keep moving.” It is obligatory for rappers to announce that they are the best, but the difference with Lamar is that he does it in a way that suggests he might well have a point. Hence Element, a post-fame restatement of the claims made on Rigamortus. Call me out on your track if you disagree, he suggests, but be warned: I will destroy you lyrically and, worse, “make it look sexy”. Lamar in storytelling mode, albeit a story based on real events: his father’s 80s encounter with Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith, then a gangster, but ultimately the boss of Lamar’s record label. It is a complex, insightful and utterly gripping story, revolving around “one decision that changed both of their lives”. A perfect example of Lamar’s ability to turn a hackneyed style on its head. The chorus sounds like a nihilistic party anthem – “why you babysitting only two or three shots?” – his urgent rap involves peer pressure, puking and getting beaten up, a cameo from his conscience and an examination of the roots of alcoholism. A relation of Swimming Pools (Drank), this time homing in on drugs. Empathic rather than preachy, the verse where he recounts a conversation with a girl who has taken too much of everything is brilliantly, richly painted, with the spongy-sounding beat – a sample of Odd Future offshoot The Jet Age of Tomorrow – the perfect compliment. Without wishing to gush, Lamar is so good at what he does that anything in this Top 10 could reasonably be at No 1. Case in point: MAAD City’s intricate, perfectly handled six-minute story of his youth in Compton, which turns into a completely different track midway through and powers towards a nightmarish climax. Another Good Kid, MAAD City song in two parts – rapped from different perspectives, with different producers handling each section – it variously examines the responsibilities involved in using real people as material for songs, contemplates the worth of legacies and depicts the aftermath of a murder. It is dense and complicated material, done with seeming effortlessness. A lot of To Pimp a Butterfly deals with pent-up emotions. The Blacker the Berry is the breathtaking moment when they explode, the album’s P-funk-y sound warping into something darker, the lyrics seething – “You hate me don’t you? You hate my people” – its rage directed inward and outward, the final verse offering a jaw-dropping twist. The standout from the interstitial demo collection Untitled Unmastered, Untitled 2 is of a piece with, and of the same standard as, To Pimp a Butterfly – free-blowing sax, a vocal that shifts from a prematurely aged quiver to something more strident, a lyric that dissects hip-hop’s obsession with materialism without exempting himself from criticism. Over a dreamy sample from the indie band Beach House, Lamar vividly picks apart the bleak motivations behind his ambitions. His verses are fantastic, the hook by Anna Wise – from another indie band, Sonnymoon – is gorgeous and Jay Rock’s cameo is the sound of a man grabbing an opportunity with both hands. You could argue that King Kunta’s lines dismissing rappers who use ghostwriters – presumably aimed at longstanding frenemy Drake – are a bit rich coming from someone who has worked with the ghostwriter-employing Dr Dre, but who cares when the G-funk-inspired beat is so inspired and infectious and Lamar’s rhymes so deftly handled? Lamar at his most straightforward. Humble attracted a degree of controversy – the lines about the need for natural beauty deemed a bit male-gaze and judgmental towards women – but the track is irresistible: an earworm piano hook, a beat that shunts the song along, the lyrics taking one check-me-out shot after another. At one point, Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe was mooted as a collaboration with Lady Gaga. Listening to the finished product, it is hard to see how that would have worked, not least because it is perfect as it is, the horizontal, stoned-in-the-sunshine music at odds with the fretful lyrics about fame and the state of hip-hop. The best track on Good Kid, MAAD City – its rhymes, according to their author, bearing the influence of Eminem – Backstreet Freestyle offers an image of Lamar at 16 and as thorough a demonstration of his latter-day lyrical skills as you could wish for, his vocal constantly altering its speed and style. As we have already established, you can happily swap the order of this Top 10 around as you please, but Alright grabs the top spot not just because of its Pharrell-produced quality, but also its impact. There is a theory that, in an age of social media, music can no longer wield the kind of epochal power it once did – there are too many other distractions. You get where that opinion comes from, but the sight of Black Lives Matter protesters – first in Cleveland, then across the US – chanting Alright’s chorus like a 21st-century equivalent of We Shall Overcome is a strong refutation: era-defining music for an era-defining moment.",Arts/Music,Kendrick Lamar’s 20 greatest songs – ranked!,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/05/kendrick-lamar-20-greatest-songs-ranked
5/5/2022,"It was one of London’s hottest theatre tickets for 2020: a Pulitzer-nominated play with the enticing pairing of actors Timothée Chalamet and Eileen Atkins. But just over two years after Amy Herzog’s drama 4000 Miles had been scheduled to have its first performance at the Old Vic, the long-postponed production has finally been cancelled. A message from Chalamet, Atkins and the Old Vic’s artistic director, Matthew Warchus, was emailed to ticket bookers on Thursday morning. “Despite an enormous amount of effort from all involved, we have now sadly and reluctantly concluded that we are unable to reschedule the show at a time possible for everyone involved,” it stated. The postponement of 4000 Miles – one of the top-selling shows to be scheduled at the Old Vic, where Chalamet would have made his London stage debut – was first announced on 18 March 2020. That day the Old Vic temporarily closed its doors in light of the government’s Covid-19 advice to avoid going to theatres. The following month, the theatre stated that work was continuing on a daily basis to arrange a new date for the production, which was fully rehearsed at the point the lockdown started. Thursday’s statement said that “despite two years of trying hard to make it work”, it has proved impossible. It described the Old Vic as on “a long and precarious road to recovery and it urgently needs all the financial support it can get”. Ticket bookers would be playing a significant part in supporting the theatre’s survival if the ticket cost was donated rather than refunded, it added. A similar point was made to those who had tickets for the Old Vic’s Endgame, starring Daniel Radcliffe and Alan Cumming, when it closed two weeks early in March 2020. Then, the theatre stated that offering a full refund to customers would be “financially devastating”. It is a sign that, more than two years after theatres were first plunged into the coronavirus crisis, the situation for many venues is still dire. The Old Vic is a charity that receives no government funding and relies entirely on ticket sales, sponsorship and donations. In May 2020, Warchus told the Guardian that it was in a “seriously perilous” financial situation and that its reserve funds would last “a small number of months”. In October 2020 it was announced that the theatre would receive a £3m grant from the government’s £1.57bn culture recovery fund. Chalamet is one of today’s most in-demand film actors: he has reunited with Call Me By Your Name director Luca Guadagnino for Bones and All; he plays Willy Wonka in an upcoming version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory; and he is starring in a sequel to Dune. Eileen Atkins’ acclaimed memoir, Will She Do?, was published last autumn, when she told the Observer she would be appearing in a new series of Doc Martin for ITV and a film in which Derek Jacobi will play George Bernard Shaw, and she will play his wife, Charlotte.",Arts/Stage,Timothée Chalamet’s West End debut cancelled after two years of postponements,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/05/timothee-chalamets-west-end-debut-cancelled-after-two-years-of-postponements
