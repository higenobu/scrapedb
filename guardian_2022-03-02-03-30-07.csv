3/2/2022,"The government’s long-delayed register of offshore owners of UK property will fail to tackle corruption unless multiple loopholes in the draft legislation are closed, experts have warned. On Monday, the government announced it would introduce a “register of overseas entities” requiring anonymous foreign owners of UK property to publicly declare their true identities as part of its draft Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) bill. The legislation would require any overseas owner of a UK property, including an owner hiding behind secrecy devices such as shell companies, trusts or foundations, to disclose their identity to Companies House. It would apply to any property in England and Wales bought by an overseas company within the past 20 years. Failure to comply with the register would be punished with a prison sentence of up to five years, or daily fines of up to £500. Experts warned that the draft bill’s apparently feeble enforcement measures and seemingly endless delays to implementation would severely hamstring its effectiveness. Steve Goodrich, head of research and investigations at the anti-corruption group Transparency International UK, said the bill’s proposed £500-per-day fine for non-compliance would be laughed off by corrupt officials. “Where prosecution isn’t really an option, because for instance the owner lives in Russia, which doesn’t extradite its citizens, then you’re left with fines only. £500 a day is small change for those with deep pockets,” he said. “We’re calling for graduated sanctions, increasing fines over a certain period, with the prospect of confiscation where non-compliance is stubborn.” The timescale for the register being brought into force remains vague. The government announcement says “implementation will proceed at pace” once the bill has been passed by parliament, though it provides no details on dates. Goodrich said the draft bill contained an 18-month “transition window” to allow overseas owners time to comply with the rules. “Those looking to make a swift exit for the door have it held wide open for them,” he complained. A register of offshore property owners was first proposed in 2015 by David Cameron, as part of a raft of measures to prevent criminals and corrupt foreign officials from laundering money through expensive UK property. Legislation to enact it has been delayed for years, amid suspicion that lobbyists and some politicians have sought to delay it. Questions also remain as to what checks will be conducted to ensure that those registering under the new law are telling the truth, according to Graham Barrow, a financial crime consultant. Barrow has for years warned that Companies House, which administers company registration in the UK, allows company owners and directors to file obviously false information. Last month he identified a newly registered UK company with share capital of £146tn, which is more than twice the GDP of the entire world. He said that unless the government accelerated plans to require Companies House to verify company information, overseas owners of property could circumvent the new register by owning their offshore company through the UK, and providing incorrect details to the Companies House. On Monday the government released a white paper about Companies House reform, which sets out the government’s position on the issue and is a precursor to possible draft legislation. “I don’t understand why we’re getting a white paper on something that the government has consulted on, sat on, for years,” Barrow said. A White Paper!We don't need another white paper. We need legislation to be laid before the House.What needs to be debated!We know what needs to be done.The House knows what needs to be done.They need to get on and do it without delay.",Lifestyle/Money,"Register of offshore owners of UK properties full of loopholes, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/01/register-of-offshore-owners-of-uk-properties-full-of-loopholes-say-experts

Missile strikes on Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, killed at least 18 civilians and wounded dozens more when they struck the regional government headquarters and a residential bloc. Another Russian missile strike hit the Ukrainian capital’s TV tower, killing five people and wounding five more near the site of the Babyn Yar memorial to second world war Nazi massacres. Russia’s defence ministry urged Kyiv’s inhabitants to leave, saying it planned to strike communications and intelligence sites in the capital. More than 70 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed after Russian artillery hit a military base in Okhtyrka, a city between Kharkiv and Kyiv, the head of the region wrote on Telegram. The southern Ukraine city of Kherson is “surrounded” by Russian soldiers, according to the city’s mayor. Russia’s missile strikes amounted to state terrorism and a war crime that nobody would forgive or forget, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said. In an emotional address to the European parliament Zelenskiy reiterated Ukraine’s wish to join the EU, saying the country was “fighting for survival” and to be “equal members of Europe”. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, described Vladimir Putin’s invasion as a battle between “the rule of law and the rule of the gun”. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said “reports of Russia’s human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law mounting by the hour”. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, said Russia’s attack on Kharkiv was “sickening” and reminiscent of massacres of civilians in Sarajevo in the 1990s. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, claimed allegations of Russian strikes on civilian targets and the use of cluster and vacuum bombs were fakes. At least 136 civilians have been killed, including 13 children, and 400 have been injured since the start of the invasion last week, the UN human rights office said. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have abandoned their homes to escape the Russian advance and more than 660,000 have fled the country, the UN said.

3/2/2022,"A huge armoured column is rolling towards Kyiv, raising fears Russia may pulverise civilian areas in its attempt to seize Ukraine’s capital after missiles killed at least 18 civilians in the country’s second city and five more died in a strike on Kyiv’s TV tower. The Russian defence ministry on Tuesday urged Kyiv residents and those “involved by nationalists in provocations against Russia” to leave the city before what it called “high-precision strikes” that it claimed would be aimed at security service targets, even as officials in Moscow said more ceasefire talks would be held on Wednesday. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, accused the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, of “murdering innocent civilians” as he tweeted video of a huge explosion in Kharkiv’s Freedom Square, calling it a “barbaric missile strike” resulting from Putin’s inability to “break Ukraine down”. Officials said the Freedom Square strike on a regional government building left 10 civilians dead and Ukrainian emergency services said a later missile strike on a residential building in Kharkiv had killed eight more.

He commits more war crimes out of fury, murders innocent civilians. The world can and must do more. INCREASE PRESSURE, ISOLATE RUSSIA FULLY! pic.twitter.com/tN4VHF1A9n The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said repeated Russian missile strikes on Kharkiv amounted to state terrorism and a war crime. “Nobody will forgive. Nobody will forget,” he said, describing the strikes as “frank, undisguised terror”. The attack on the TV tower in Kyiv, which killed five people and wounded five others, was close to the memorial site that commemorates the victims of Babyn Yar, the ravine where Nazi soldiers massacred up to 150,000 people during the second world war – including more than 30,000 Jews - Zelenskiy tweeted: “What is the point of saying ‘never again’ for 80 years, if the world stays silent when a bomb drops on the same site of Babyn Yar? At least five killed. History repeating…” Israel’s Yad Vashem World Holocaust Remembrance Centre voiced its “vehement condemnation” of the Russian attack. “We call on the international community to take concerted measures to safeguard civilian lives as well as these historical sites because of their irreplaceable value for research, education and commemoration of the Holocaust,” it said. In a highly emotional address to the European parliament on Tuesday that was greeted with a standing ovation, the Ukrainian president said at least 16 children had been killed around Ukraine on Monday and mocked Russia’s claim that it was going after only military targets. “Where are these children, what kind of military factories do they work at? What tanks are they going at, launching cruise missiles?” He reiterated his country’s wish to join the EU, saying Ukraine “has a desire to see our children alive – I think it is a fair one. We are fighting for survival. We are fighting to be equal members of Europe. We are exactly the same as you are.” More than 70 Ukrainian soldiers were also killed in the eastern city of Okhtyrka, between Kharkiv and Kyiv, in a Russian missile strike on a military base, local officials said, giving conflicting accounts of when the attack took place. On the sixth day of fighting since Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine, the failure of its armed forces, amid continuing stiff resistance, to capture a single major city has led western countries to warn that commanders may increasingly bomb civilian areas. International sanctions and global financial isolation, which have had a sudden and devastating impact on Russia’s economy, with the rouble in freefall and long queues outside banks, may further increase the Kremlin’s frustration, observers have said. . The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva that Russian strikes were “hitting schools, hospitals, and residential buildings”, with “reports of Russia’s human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law mounting by the hour”. The British defence ministry said in an intelligence update on Tuesday that the Russian advance on Kyiv had “made little progress over the past 24 hours, probably as a result of continuing logistical difficulties”, warning that an apparent shift in Russian tactics would inevitably put Ukrainian civilians at much greater peril. At least 136 civilians have been killed, including 13 children, and 400 have been injured since the start of the invasion last week, the UN human rights office (OHCHR) said on Tuesday, adding that the real toll would almost certainly be much higher. One Okhtyrka resident, Igor, said the city had been attacked every day since 24 February hitting not just military but also civilian targets, sometimes with thermobaric rockets. “It’s awful – I feel angry and desperate,” he told the Guardian. The key south-eastern city of Mariupol, which separatists have said they aim to encircle with 24 hours, was without electricity following multiple missile attacks from advancing Russian forces, while reports said the southern city of Kherson was surrounded. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, said in Warsaw with his Polish counterpart, Mateusz Morawiecki, that it was clear Putin was “prepared to use barbaric and indiscriminate tactics”, later describing the attack on Kharkiv as “absolutely sickening” and reminiscent of massacres of civilians in Sarajevo in the 1990s. The major eastern city had already come under heavy fire on Monday, with at least nine people – including three children – killed and 37 injured by missile strikes hitting civilian areas. “It’s not just a war, this is a massacre of Ukrainian people,” the mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said Human rights groups and Ukraine’s ambassador to the US have accused Russia of using cluster bombs and vacuum bombs, weapons that are normally banned in civilian areas. The US said it had no confirmation of their use. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said allegations of Russian strikes on civilian targets and the use of cluster and vacuum bombs were fakes, adding it was “out of the question” that sanctions would “force us to change our position” on the invasion, which Russia calls a “special operation” to demilitarise and “denazify” Ukraine. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, called on Russia to end the war, calling it “totally unacceptable”, but added that “as a defensive alliance” the organisation would not send troops or combat jets to avoid becoming part of the conflict. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have abandoned their homes to escape the Russian advance and more than 660,000 have fled the country, according to the UN refugee agency, with thousands awaiting passage at European border crossings. Ukraine’s general staff said on Tuesday Russian losses since the attack included 5,710 personnel, 29 destroyed and damaged aircraft, and 198 tanks. The figures could not be verified. The escalation in shelling and missile strikes in Ukraine’s urban areas came as a Russian military column gathering to the north of Kyiv was estimated to be 40 miles (64km) long, more than double its size three days ago. Satellite photos also showed deployments of ground forces and ground attack helicopter units in southern Belarus, although the country’s pro-Russia president, Alexander Lukashenko, said on Tuesday he had no plans to join the invasion. As an unprecedented raft of international sanctions began to bite, including crippling measures against Russia’s central bank preventing it from using its $630bn of foreign reserves to prop up the rouble, the oil giant Shell became the latest western firm to announce it was pulling out of Russia. BP and Norway’s Equinor have also said they are quitting the country, which relies on oil and gas for export earnings, while multiple major banks, airlines and carmakers have ended partnerships, halted shipments and denounced the Russian invasion. The shipping group Maersk followed other international transport groups on Tuesday in saying it was suspending all container shipments to and from Russia except those containing food, medical and humanitarian supplies. In the cultural arena, three major film studios, Sony, Disney and Warner Bros, said they were pausing cinema releases in Russia, and YouTube is in the process of blocking Russia’s state-backed news channels RT and Sputnik in Europe.

3/2/2022,"It’s just the sort of ersatz product that would have made Del Boy proud – but the makers of Only Fools and Horses are suing an unauthorised immersive theatre show based on the BBC sitcom for copyright infringement. The case, which could redraw the limits of British law, pits a television production company founded by the sitcom’s late writer John Sullivan against the creators of Only Fools: The (Cushty) Dining Experience. At these events, first run in 2018, paying customers enjoy drinks and a three-course meal while interacting with actors playing characters such as Del Boy, Rodney, Uncle Albert, Marlene, Cassandra, Boycie, Trigger and DCI Roy Slater. The case being heard over three days at the high court this week hinges on who owns the copyright to the characters from a fictional work, and whether it is possible to in effect produce new Only Fools And Horses material without permission from the author of the original scripts. Lawyers representing Shazam, the company set up by Sullivan prior to his death in 2011, told the court that the dining experience made extensive use of copyrighted material. They claim it exploits the “distinctive character traits conceived by John Sullivan” and his characters’ “signature phrases and ways of speaking” in order to sell tickets. “The sitcom constitutes one of the most valuable properties in British television,” the barrister Jonathan Hill, who is leading Shazam’s legal team, told the judge. “The outcome of this claim could have potentially very serious ramifications for [Shazam’s] exploitation of its intellectual property in relation to the sitcom.” Among other issues the judge will consider are whether it is possible to copyright the phrase “shut up you tart”, whether “lovely jubbly” is a generic south london saying or was created by Sullivan, and whether Del Boy’s mangled use of French phrases such as “creme de menthe” can be protected under law. “Del uses French as a manifestation of his desire to appear sophisticated but often undoes that desire by often getting it wrong/mangled,” Shazam’s lawyers argue in a written filing. “These are not purely verbal gags but part of Del’s character as they demonstrate Del’s need to put on a front, to sound impressive and sophisticated, even if actually wrong.” The lawyers argue the dining experience is a breach of copyright law and is guilty of passing off – essentially tricking customers into thinking it was an officially endorsed product. “Considerable intellectual creativity on the part of John Sullivan was expended in developing the character, both at the outset and over the course of writing the body of scripts for Only Fools and Horses,” they said. The operators of the show contend that the Only Fools and Horses characters cannot be protected by copyright, and that their production is a clearly an unofficial homage that is permitted under fair dealing restrictions. A key issue is whether the scripts of Only Fools and Horses are “literary works” – which enjoy a higher standard of copyright protection – or “dramatic works”. The court will also have to consider whether a legally permitted pastiche of a copyright work needs to be noticeably different from the original material. The outcome of the case could have implications for other pastiche or tribute works based on copyrighted material, potentially redrawing the line between illegal knockoff work and authorised parody.",News/Media,Only Fools and Horses firm sues creators of ‘cushty’ dining events,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/01/only-fools-and-horses-firm-sues-creators-of-cushty-dining-events
3/2/2022,"The Royal Court Theatre has apologised “unreservedly” to the Jewish community for naming a fictional, manipulative billionaire Hershel Fink. It comes as a report by the theatre’s board on Tuesday found that the systems in place were inadequate to identify and correct the issue at the appropriate time. Anthony Burton, chair of the Royal Court, said: “The Royal Court Theatre apologises unreservedly for the pain that has been caused around the production of its play Rare Earth Mettle. “This incident fell short of the Royal Court’s own high ambitions in terms of inclusivity and anti-racism. It is committed to learning from it and clear actions have been put in place including specialist training on antisemitism. “The Royal Court must and will become a space in which Jewish artists and other professionals can work without fear of antisemitism, as it always should have been.” The play, by Al Smith, originally featured Hershel Fink as the CEO of an electric car company, who in marketing material was portrayed as a grasping billionaire trying to monopolise the earth’s resources. The theatre apologised and changed the name to Henry Finn after it was accused of perpetuating an offensive stereotype. Theatre management said they were unaware that Hershel Fink was a Jewish name and called the incident an example of “unconscious bias”. But it emerged that concerns were raised about the character’s name during a workshop discussion two months previously. Two of the theatre’s corporate sponsors later withdrew their financial support after the row. The inquiry conducted extensive interviews and research. It stated: “Systems should have been in place to ensure that any individual error would not prevent the identification and correction of the issue by the theatre. The artistic leadership recognise and deeply regret this and apologise.” It said the play was developed over an exceptionally long period, largely due to Covid, having been originally commissioned in 2015 but only produced in the spring of 2020 and brought back in November 2021. Fifteen drafts were written. “The choice of the name Hershel Fink was originally underpinned with explanatory narrative context. This context was ultimately excised during the prolonged editing process,” it said, adding that the combination of this and aspects of the character’s personality “could be an antisemitic trope”. Actions have been agreed to remedy this, it said, including specialist training on antisemitism and organising more opportunities for staff to interrogate and challenge artistic decisions. The Royal Court’s artistic director Vicky Featherstone told the Jewish Chronicle: “The big learning for me has been about how few Jewish artists have felt that they can be out about their Jewishness with their work at the Royal Court, and in other areas of culture. “That was an absolute shock and something which feel a huge sense of responsibility to be able to make a shift about and do something about.”",Arts/Stage,Royal Court Theatre apologises to Jewish community over character’s name,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/01/royal-court-theatre-apologises-to-jewish-community-over-characters-name
3/2/2022,"The International Paralympic Committee has admitted it will have to be “very careful” in deciding on Wednesday whether to allow Russian athletes to compete at the Winter Games. After it was confirmed that Ukraine’s 20-strong delegation would be travelling to China following uncertainty over their presence at the Games, a decision on Russian involvement will be taken on Wednesday, ahead of the Games beginning this weekend. The head of the IPC, Andrew Parsons, said any outcome must be based on “our constitution and the values we stand for,” but that “the options in front of us will be limited by legal framework”. Parsons told the BBC: “Any decision we take is open to legal challenge from different sides. This is what we need to be very careful about because it could be from Russia or from other nations. We need to make a decision based on our constitution and the values we stand for. “The options that we have in front of us will be, I think, limited by legal framework. We have a competition starting in three days. We need to make a decision that if it’s challenged we are able to defend it and maintain it.” On Monday the International Olympic Committee issued a resolution calling on all sporting organisations to remove Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from international competition. On Tuesday World Athletics responded to the IOC resolution by banning Russian and Belarusian athletes “for the foreseeable future” and with “immediate effect” - meaning none will take part in the European Athletics Indoor Championships in Serbia this month. The IOC resolution came with an exception, which would allow Russians to compete but as neutral athletes if time or legal constraints prevented their removal. This was created specifically with the Winter Paralympics in mind, given it is due to start within three days. Russian athletes were already set to compete in Beijing under the banner of “Russian Paralympic Committee” or RPC following sanctions taken by the IPC in response to a scandal involving the Russian Anti-Doping Agency. Following the IOC resolution, however, a number of organisations, including ParalympicsGB, called for Russia to be banned from the Games entirely. “Given the magnitude of the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Ukraine we cannot see how the participation of Russia or Belarus in the Beijing 2022 Paralympic Winter Games is compatible with the objectives of the Paralympic movement,” a statement said. News about the Ukrainian team was meanwhile confirmed by the National Committee for Sports for the Disabled of Ukraine. “Part of the team is in one place, part is in another,” she said. “I hope that today we will unite and get to the airport and go to Beijing together. The team is not in Ukraine. We will not tell where we are. When we come to Beijing, we will tell.

3/2/2022,"While across the Pacific communities are dealing with shrinking coastlines, one area in Papua New Guinea has an altogether different problem: a new island that has solidified and started supporting vegetation in the last few years has caused tensions and even outbreaks of violence as competing clans lay claim to the land. That fight has been intensified as communities struggle to deal with the consequences of warming oceans and the devastating impact of natural disasters. The island, off the village of Gona in Oro province, and accessible by canoe, has gradually formed from three smaller islands over the course of two decades but has only solidified over the past few years. Uninhabited bar the occasional fisherman, it is now home to diverse local flora. Tropical pine (Klinki pine) make up the majority of trees while low-growing shrubs cover the rest of the island. “At first [when forming], it was made entirely of just crushed coral and sand, but now there’s soil and we see vegetation that normally only grows in soil,” says Simon Seboda, a local fisherman. “We haven’t planted anything. Everything sprang up naturally and on its own. The rain and waves wash a lot of seeds on to the island.” But the island’s emergence from the waves has caused tensions among two local clans, which have taken the matter to village and district courts in a bid to resolve the dispute. On several occasions they have come to blows, including one instance in which a man was stabbed. Members of the Yega tribe say their ancestors first settled the mainland opposite the island hundreds of years ago, in a village called Waususu, and eventually moved inland. But the Garara people who now live along the coastline have also laid claim to the island. “If you look at old maps, the land didn’t exist back then,” says deputy provincial administrator Joe Mokada. “And so, when warring tribes fought over land, this land wasn’t there to be fought over. “But, in recent years, the island was formed, vegetation started growing there and people feel entitled to the land but we have to determine who, if anyone, it belongs to. It’s a strange phenomenon, in which, while other parts of the Pacific, they are losing land to rising sea waters – we are instead gaining land.” The formation of the island is yet to be studied. Locals say that the government and environmental experts have not visited the area to investigate. However, the community believes the island formed as wind and waves repeatedly deposited sediment – potentially pollution from a local palm oil factory – parallel to the shoreline, similar to the formation of a barrier island. “Since the late 80s, when the oil palm factory commenced production, we have seen pollution in our ocean that came down from the Bangoho River [mouth]. We noticed the coral started dying and the fish population decreased,” says Seboda. “We especially noticed a drastic change after Cyclone Guba devastated [the province of] Oro in 2007. Coastal villages from Binjefada to Garara [along the Gona coast] were destroyed. But while these villages were destroyed, this island started forming.” Schneider Yasi, a private geologist for Kingston Resources who has reviewed maps of the area, thinks the island is likely to have been formed by sediment deposits. “It may have been a reef system that was eventually engulfed by the delta’s continuous sedimentation,” he said. The dispute over the new island has also disrupted plans by local marine association Kikiri Local Marine Management Area (KLMMA), formed by youth from the area, to protect and sustainably manage marine resources in the area. The association began planting mangroves around the island to protect the surrounding wetlands and ecosystems, with future plans to turn the island into an ecotourism attraction. However, their plans were abruptly halted by local village elders. “The older generation won’t be around to feel the worsening effects of climate change, yet they are the ones putting a halt to our plans, just to argue over whose land it is,” says Elijah Yapuri from Banumo village and a member of the association. “Our generation will feel the full brunt of climate change and are already seeing it with our corals dying, villages going under and so we are pushing to continue efforts to protect these resources for future. But they don’t see it that way.” The effects of the climate crisis are evident in Oro province and have intensified the dispute over this new land, as villages are destroyed by cyclones, or submerged by king tides, and food sources, like fish, become more scarce. Local fishermen say they have to go some miles out into the ocean to fish because the water around the coast is too warm for fish and other sea creatures. “Years ago, fish was abundant in this area,” Seboda says. “We used to simply throw our nets out and fetch tons of fish, and a variety of them too. “But now the water is too hot for them and the coral reefs near land have died so they have migrated further out into the ocean, away from the land, so we have to travel further out there on our canoes to fish. I worry that one day we won’t have any fish in the ocean.” The villages that lined the once thriving coastline are now few and far between. A few tall, sturdy coconut trees are all that is left of the villages destroyed when Cyclone Guba hit in 2007. Oro was particularly badly affected and 149 people were killed. Waususu, once a populous village, is now regularly inundated with water. Places where houses used to stand are now covered in mangroves and swamp. “We are standing where the centre of the village used to be,” Seboda says, as he stands knee-deep in a lagoon. “Because of the cyclone and the sea levels rising, the people had to flee inland and settle where they could, because all land here is customary land.” “When it’s high tide, the water comes all the way in, and we walk around with the water all the way to our ankles, that’s why our houses are built high above on long, wooden stilts,” one villager, Mary, says. “There is no beach when the tide is high. The water rises over the beach which forces people passing by to come through our village to avoid the water. “We are used to it now. We have no choice but be used to it … we have nowhere else to go.”",News/World news,‘A strange phenomenon’: new island in Papua New Guinea prompts territorial dispute,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/a-strange-phenomenon-new-island-in-papua-new-guinea-prompts-territorial-dispute
3/2/2022,"Russia is planning a major psychological operation to try to persuade Ukrainians to capitulate, and is targeting civilians with missile strikes in an attempt to demoralise the population, the government in Kyiv said on Tuesday. Two Russian missiles struck the TV tower in the Ukrainian capital, knocking out some access to news and broadcasts. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said the Kremlin was preparing to cut off a large part of Ukraine from the internet and communications. “Its goal is to break the resistance of the people and the army. They can arrange a breakdown of connection. After [that] the spread of massive fake messages that the country’s leadership has given up,” Reznikov posted on Twitter. He added: “No surrender! Only victory!” Ukrainian officials said Russia would not be able to switch off internet access for the entire country. Instead it was likely to target the south and east, where Russian forces are seeking to take control of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, and the encircled port city of Mariupol. The “capitulation” media operation coincides with a second round of negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian officials, scheduled for Wednesday. The first round, held on the Belarus border, yielded no positive results. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, confirmed that the TV tower was offline, its substation and hardware having been damaged. Engineers would try to fix the tower and broadcasts would restart as soon as possible, he said. ⚡️Ворог атакує столицю!

Israel’s Yad Vashem World Holocaust Remembrance Centre voiced its “vehement condemnation” of the Russian attack near the site. “We call on the international community to take concerted measures to safeguard civilian lives as well as these historical sites because of their irreplaceable value for research, education and commemoration of the Holocaust,” it said. 🇷🇺is preparing to launch an info&psycho operation.Its goal is to break the resistance of🇺🇦ppl&army.

Six days after the start of the invasion, Russia has mostly given up on the pretence that it is exclusively wiping out military targets. Instead it has inflicted further civilian carnage. At least 10 people were killed and 35 wounded by a series of missile strikes on homes and offices in Kharkiv. They included a long-range rocket fired at the city’s main regional administrative building, a symbol of Ukrainian statehood. Video showed the rocket smashing into the government office at 8am, sending clouds of dust and debris into the air. Several civilian cars were driving past. The strike was an attempt by Moscow to kill Kharkiv’s governor and to wipe out his leadership team, officials said. The governor, Oleh Synyehubov, has led the defence of the city, which saw off a raid on Sunday by Russian forces trying to seize control. Since Monday the Kremlin has stepped up its bombardment of Kharkiv, home to 1.4 million people, in an apparent shift in tactics. Russian missiles on Tuesday struck numerous targets with zero military value, residents said. They included the opera and ballet theatre, Kharkiv’s recently opened zoo, next to a central park area, and hospital number three, torn in half. The city’s aviation factory was hit for the third time. “All of our dreams have been destroyed,” said Galina Padalko, a communications manager for a Ukrainian publishing house. “Today it was the administration building and zoo. Yesterday it was our neighbourhood. The bombing started five days ago. It hasn’t stopped.” Padalko said the central Kharkiv flat she shared with her husband, Dmytro, was 700 metres from where a Russian missile landed in a street on Monday, killing a woman who had gone out for shopping. “We don’t leave our flat. We use the corridor as a bomb shelter,” she said. Rescuers picked through the rubble on Freedom Square where the regional administration building is located. They retrieved bodies and extracted 10 survivors from the rubble. One of the dead was an Indian student. A child was wounded. Nearby were incinerated cars and giant slabs of masonry. Another airstrike hit a five-storey residential building, killing eight people and injuring six, city officials said. Firefighters dug out two survivors. They also put out a fire on the opera theatre’s roof. In a video message, Zelenskiy said: “This is terror against Kharkiv, terror against Ukraine. There was no military target on the square. The rocket to the central square is outright, undisguised terror. No one will forgive. Nobody will forget. This strike on Kharkiv is a war crime.” Zelenskiy said the Kremlin was now deliberately targeting Kyiv and Kharkiv in an attempt “to break our resistance”. With military victory elusive and Ukrainian’s army still fighting, Putin appears to be doubling down by sending in additional forces. More troops were heading to Kyiv, including a convoy of Belarusian armoured vehicles. They entered Ukraine’s Chernihiv region from the north as Belarus joined Russia in its war for the first time. Strikes against civilians now appear to be deliberate policy. Ukraine’s former defence minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk said: “The rocket fired at the administration building was a planned attack. The idea is to break Kharkiv psychologically so they [the Russians] can get into the city. Obviously that doesn’t work with Ukrainians. They don’t know that yet. “Of course people are worried. They are concerned. They think they could be next. But that doesn’t influence the desire to fight and protect.” With the war entering a new, brutal phase, Ukraine’s military took heavy losses. More than 70 Ukrainian soldiers were killed as Russian artillery hit a military base in Okhtyrka, a city between Kharkiv and Kyiv. In the south, Russian forces continued to consolidate their grip. The port city of Mariupol was surrounded by Russian troops, with regular forces in the north and west and separatist rebels to the east. The city was without electricity after multiple rocket attacks. Armoured vehicles and Russian infantry entered Kherson, which had been holding out since last week’s invasion. Hennadiy Lahuta, the head of the Kherson regional administration, said Russians had penetrated the city. Air raid sirens and loud explosions could be heard. In the southern city of Melitopol, now under Russian occupation, a crowd of unarmed civilians stood in front of a Russian convoy. They chanted: “Fascists. Are you going to shoot us peacefully? We don’t have weapons. Go home.” And: “Fuck off.” One nervous Russian solider fired shots into the air. In Sumy Oblast, in the north-east, close to the Russian border, the first prisoner swap of the conflict took place. Five territorial defence members were traded for a Russian officer, said Sumy’s regional governor, Dmytro Zhyvytskyy, on social media. He said it was the first such swap in the area, Reuters reported. He posted a video of a blond-haired man in handcuffs wearing a green camouflage jacket, saying he was born in 1997 in the Russian city of Omsk.",News/World news,Ukraine says Russia targeting civilians as missiles hit Kyiv TV tower,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/ukraine-russia-civilians-missiles-kyiv-tv-tower
3/2/2022,"The past has invaded the present. Russia’s military aggression has burst over Ukraine like a storm cloud gathered from a different, darker time. It is raining terror and destruction on a country that has seen tank columns like the one Vladimir Putin has ordered to Kyiv before, but not in the last seven decades. The Kremlin claims to be landing surgical strikes. The reality for civilians on the ground is butchery. Until this happened, the western imagination struggled to process the idea that Putin would go through with it. His cynical disregard for human life was never doubted, but his callousness was thought to include rational self-interest. Compassion was not going to stop the Russian president unleashing hell, but maybe some other calculation would impose restraint – the prospect of economic ruin, or of losing the support of ordinary Russians who have no boiling grievance against Ukrainians. But success at domestic repression and years of international equivocation have convinced Putin that brutality works. I was in Chechnya in 2003, covering a Kremlin-rigged referendum to formalise the breakaway republic’s reabsorption into Russia. Grozny was still a smouldering ruin. The polling stations were empty. The only way to distinguish empty rubble from functioning homes was by the words “people live here” daubed on the bricks. That is what victory looks like for Putin. And still, people thought the Kremlin’s capacity for violence had some psychological limit; that it could be checked by an invisible force field of diplomacy or economics. The Russian line that Ukrainians need rescuing from their own government – that their sham nation wants dissolution into a greater Slavic motherland – sounded like some grotesque pastiche of a 20th-century dictator. But there was still doubt as to whether Putin actually believed that stuff. The question was answered when he reached the page in the fascist playbook where tanks fire on children. Western conviction that this is not supposed to happen in Europe any more has not stopped it happening. The shock is producing dramatic policy changes across the continent. The most historically significant shift is in Germany, which is sending weapons to Kyiv and ramping up defence spending. Gone overnight is the taboo around military assertiveness that was born of national atonement for the Third Reich. Chancellor Olaf Scholz is using the old moral compass to reorient his country for an altered landscape. “It is a new era,” he told the Bundestag. In Britain, the necessary adjustment has a different character. The UK has never been squeamish about hard power. Successive prime ministers have sounded more hawkish against Putin than counterparts on the continent. There are British soldiers in the Baltic and Poland, reinforcing Nato’s eastern boundary. The British weakness is more subtle, relating to the dysfunctional relationship with the EU. It is the refusal to see the European project on its own terms: not just a trading bloc but a strategic alliance founded with a moral purpose – a framework of law and economic integration that locks democracy in and tyranny out. That was understood by former Soviet satellite countries in eastern Europe when they applied to join the EU and Nato simultaneously. It was understood by the Labour government that used Britain’s seat at the top table of both institutions to champion those double accessions. It was understood by Ukrainians who wanted their government to sign an association agreement with Brussels in 2014. And it was understood by Putin, who saw that deal as an affront to Russia’s regional hegemony and engineered the secession of Crimea in retaliation. But it was not understood by British Eurosceptics who indulged the Kremlin line, bemoaning the EU-Ukraine partnership as a provocation and proof that Brussels had quasi-imperial delusions of grandeur. Boris Johnson was in that camp. In 2016, he told a referendum rally that the EU partnership agreement with Ukraine had “caused real trouble”. Things in Ukraine “went wrong”, Johnson said, because “all the EU can do in this question is cause confusion”. Putin, a supporter of Brexit, agreed. That isn’t Johnson’s view now. It might not have been his view then, not a serious one. That is the problem. We have a prime minister with disposable values. He goes into a room with one opinion, but keeps a different take in his back pocket for the after-dinner crowd. In 2016, Johnson saw a way to narrate Ukraine’s tragedy as a parable of Euro-malfeasance. It involved stripping out historical context and facts but he had no qualms about that. Historical context and fact were not the Brexit stock in trade. This was an ideological movement that nuzzled the hand of Donald Trump as it vandalised every institution for upholding the postwar liberal democratic order. Brexit was a doctrine for fellow-travellers of a US president who called Angela Merkel an enemy and Putin a friend. Johnson would be glad now if that phase could be forgotten. He might have forgotten it himself, because everything is a phase for him. He grabbed the wheel of British foreign policy and yanked it this way and that, like Toad of Toad Hall in faddish thrall to a machine he could not control. Egged on by media ballyhoo and blasts of the Tory horn, he swerved off the road that was recommended by every former prime minister, every diplomat and every European ally. Parp! Parp! Into a strategic ditch. What was a question facing Britain in 2016 to which Brexit was a sensible answer? To what problem facing the country was Boris Johnson a credible solution? Now events require a policy of European engagement that can only be achieved by ignoring everything the prime minister has said on the subject. It requires a style of grown-up leadership that Johnson can affect because he is a thespian and rhetorician of some talent, but not sustain because he is also a dilettante and a fraud. He embodies a trait in Westminster culture that treats politics as pantomime, where a prime minister can play at being Churchill without Churchillian gravitas and without being accountable for words delivered with a wink, in a stage voice tinged with perpetual jest. The age of levity is over. Putin’s bombs should shake British politics into sobriety. When that happens, it will be clear that the past six years, the detour into Brexit fantasy land, have been squandered; that we need to restart relations with our neighbours from scratch. That will be hard for a prime minister who has sunk so much political capital into Eurosceptic frivolity, and appointed a cabinet in his image. But the shift is inevitable. When targets of Kremlin atrocity call out to “Europe” for help, they are appealing not to a geographical space but an idea. They are talking about security in the rule of law and democracy – the antithesis of Putinism. They mean the European project. If Britain is to be an ally to Ukraine, it must learn to speak the language of European solidarity that Brexit despises and denies.

3/2/2022,"Sainsbury’s will close 200 in-store cafes and 34 hot food counters next month as part of a big shake-up that puts about 2,000 jobs at risk. On Tuesday, the UK’s second-largest supermarket chain briefed affected cafe and counter staff on the closure plan and promised to prioritise them for vacant roles. Sainsbury’s chief executive Simon Roberts said it had been a “difficult decision” to close the cafes and it would support them in “any way we can”. “We understand this is very unsettling for our colleagues, but we must keep adapting our business to make sure we are offering customers the best possible food and drink at affordable prices,” he added. The retailer said that in the next 12 month the cafes in 30 stores would be replaced with food halls run by Boparan Restaurant Group (BRG) which owns a portfolio of brands including Carluccio’s, Ed’s Diner and Gourmet Burger Kitchen. The number of Starbucks cafes in its supermarkets would also double to 60, it said. In a similar vein to cost-cutting elsewhere in the supermarket industry as inflation bites, Sainsbury’s said 34 of its “less popular” hot food counters would also be closing. The grocer closed its fresh fish, cheese and meat counters in stores in 2020, which resulted in the loss of about 3,500 jobs. Sainsbury’s will also be restructuring the bakeries in 54 stores. These employees will enter into consultation, with the aim of redeploying those affected to other areas of their store where possible, the company said. Usdaw, the retail trade union, said the plan was “devastating” news for members affected by the proposals. Usdaw national officer Dave Gill said it would be having talks with store managers and “looking at the business case for the company’s planned changes”. “Usdaw’s priorities are to keep as many staff employed in the business and achieve the best deal possible for those affected.” Least year, Sainsbury’s began to test shopper reaction to a new food hall with the trial of The Restaurant Hub, in its Selly Oak store in Birmingham. The retailer said more hubs would open in the next two to three years if they were a hit with shoppers. The remaining 67 cafes are to remain open while Sainsbury’s reviews rollout plans. Satnam Leihal, the chief executive of BRG, said the food hubs allowed customers to place orders with multiple brands in one transaction. They could be eaten in store or delivered together, with just one delivery charge. “This gives customers choice that never existed before,” he said. Roberts said trials with BRG and Starbucks had shown it could offer a much better eat-in or takeaway experience by working with partners. “We are totally focused on improving what we can deliver for our customers and at the same time, working hard to make our business simpler,” he said.",News/Business,"Sainsbury’s embarks on major in-store shakeup putting 2,000 jobs at risk",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/01/sainsburys-embarks-on-major-in-store-shakeup-putting-2000-jobs-at-risk
3/2/2022,"An expected surge in pupils applying for state secondary school places has failed to materialise in London, Manchester and other parts of England, allowing more families to gain their first choice of schools. The number of applications for year 7 places in London fell by 1% compared with last year, despite the baby boom of a decade earlier, suggesting that population movements after the Covid pandemic and Brexit remain unsettled. Applications in Kent, Essex Leeds, Sheffield and Manchester were little changed. Other parts of England did see strong increases in demand for places in September, including Birmingham, Cornwall (both up 8%) and Oxfordshire (up 5%). Councils had been braced for an influx of applications as the children of the baby boom of 2010-11 come to the end of primary school this summer and will transfer to secondary schools in autumn. But the pan-London admissions authority, which allocates school places for 32 local authorities, said applications fell from 93,722 last year to 92,672. The authority said applications were affected by “the longer-term impacts of the pandemic, such as families moving due to changes in their circumstances and working patterns, along with the localised effect of the UK leaving the EU in some areas.” Damian White, London Councils’s chair of schools and children’s services, said: “While the total number of secondary school applications received in London this year was slightly lower than last year, pressure on different schools and local authority areas can vary. “We will be keeping an eye on birthrates and patterns of population growth so that local authorities can continue to ensure that there are sufficient school places for every child that needs one.” Nearly 70% of London applicants received their first preference of school, compared with 66% in 2021. But there were variations between boroughs, with just 60% of families in Kensington and Chelsea getting their first choice, compared with 78% in Waltham Forest and 81% in Havering. London’s decline is smaller than the 7% fall in applications for primary school places it saw in 2021, which came against the background of falling birthrates and pandemic disruption that led to some families missing the application deadline. Birmingham, which also saw a sharp decline in primary applications last year, had an extra 1,000 secondary applications this year, with the proportion of families getting their first preference slipping from 74% to 71%. Kent, with the largest number of applications outside London, saw a slight fall in overall numbers. But successful first preferences in Kent rose from 70% to 80%, while Essex’s first preference rate rose from 82% to 87%. The proportion of first choices fulfilled rose in Leeds by five percentage points to 85%, and in Manchester by three points to 77%. Sheffield had slightly fewer applications and the number of families receiving their first preference dipped to 87%.",News/Education,No year 7 surge as school first choices rise in parts of England,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/01/no-year-7-surge-as-school-first-choices-rise-in-parts-of-england
3/2/2022,"The BBC has been hit by two more high-profile exits, with the corporation’s director of drama and its director of film departing in May. Piers Wenger, who commissioned shows such as Bodyguard and A Very British Scandal, and Rose Garnett, whose credits include Small Axe and Judy, are both leaving to join US entertainment company A24 – the outfit behind hits such as HBO’s teen drama Euphoria. The losses come as the BBC faces a £285m funding gap and squeeze in its budgets after the announcement in January that its licence fee is being frozen, plus deep-pocketed competition from global streaming giants such as Netflix, Amazon and Disney+. The departures of Wenger and Garnett are part of the shifting landscape of the UK television industry as the power and money moves from the traditional broadcasters to big US companies and independent production companies. Recently the corporation has suffered a number of losses to commercial competitors. Emily Maitlis and Jon Sopel recently announced they are leaving to join LBC owner, the media group Global, while Emma Barnett has moved from Newsnight to an interview show on Bloomberg, although she remains as a presenter on Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour. Other household names that have also left include Andrew Marr, Andrew Neil and Simon McCoy. Behind the scenes, the BBC also lost another key player in December when Patrick Holland, its director of factual, arts and classical music, joined independent production giant Banijay, the makers of shows including Peaky Blinders and MasterChef. Charlotte Moore, the BBC’s chief content officer, said: “Piers Wenger has been an outstanding director of drama over the last six years at the BBC. Under his inspirational leadership, BBC Drama has flourished and at a time of intense competition, he has cemented the BBC’s reputation as the home of creative risk-taking and the most original, fearless and ambitious British storytelling.” Wenger said: “After a decade as a drama commissioner it is high time I gave someone else a go. The last six years working for Charlotte and the BBC have been more creatively challenging, more emboldening and more fun than anyone has the right to in the name of work.” Garnett said: “The BBC is unparalleled as a place to make great work. Under the inspiring and generous leadership of Charlotte Moore, myself and the film team have been able to discover, support and celebrate voices and stories from across the UK and beyond.”",News/Media,BBC’s director of drama and director of film to leave in May,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/01/bbc-director-of-drama-and-film-piers-wenger-rose-garnett-to-leave
