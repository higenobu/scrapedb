12/23/2021,"The Grinch that was “Wheel of Fortune” nearly stole a contestant’s Christmas. (Watch the video below.) Game show player Charlene Rubush was denied an Audi Q3 SUV due to a technicality on Tuesday’s episode of the popular show. At least that’s the way some viewers and media outlets saw it. Fans, including former “Jeopardy!” champ Alex Jacob, complained on Twitter that Rubush got robbed. With a handful of squares empty while solving a Bonus Round word puzzle titled “What Are You Doing?” Rubush first guessed “Choosing the right card.” But it was wrong. She tried again. “Choosing the right ― word,” she said with a delay before the buzzer. The phrase was correct and letter-revealer Vanna White appeared to begin clapping. But the buzzer sounded and host Pat Sajak went full buzz-kill. He told Rubush the phrase needed to be more continuous to count. He then revealed the prize and it was an Audi Q3. No Audi for Charlene. One viewer called it “the dumbest technicality” ever. Jacob got involved in a Twitter campaign to get Rubush the Audi. It worked. Audi USA on Wednesday apparently agreed to give her a Q3. “You’re a winner in our eyes, Charlene,” the company tweeted. “WE DID IT,” Jacob exclaimed.

12/23/2021,"Vladimir Putin’s traditionally predictable yearly press conference briefly veered off the rails Thursday as the Russian president appeared to lose his cool when confronted over Moscow’s aggression in Ukraine. After a reporter for Sky News asked whether Moscow could give security guarantees and promise not to invade its neighbor, Putin exploded: “You are demanding guarantees from us? It’s you who should give us guarantees. Immediately. Right now. And not talk it over for decades.” His comments came as Ukraine released satellite images it said showed more Russian forces building up at its border, and the Russian Defense Ministry announced massive “attack” drills in Crimea. Moscow has repeatedly claimed the moves are in response to what it sees as the threat of an expanding NATO, while Western officials view the Kremlin’s saber-rattling as a form of coercive diplomacy through which it hopes to keep its grip on Ukraine. Putin repeatedly portrayed Russia as the victim at his press conference, claiming Moscow had been dragged into the Ukraine conflict when it is really just a “mediator.” “They want to make us a party to the conflict, and it’s not like that,” he said. (Apparently in his view it was not the Russian forces seizing Crimea in 2014, the years of Kremlin propaganda, Russian support for separatists, and the reported weapons supplies that made Russia a party to the conflict.) He accused NATO of being the true aggressor, appearing to briefly seethe as he suggested the West has always sought to destroy Russia. “They tricked us. Just cheated us. Five waves of NATO enlargement,” he said. “And on top of that—no matter what we did, you always expressed ‘concerns.’ Get out of here with your ‘concerns.’ We will do what we consider necessary. We want to ensure our safety,” he said. “Our actions will depend on the situation in the sphere of security. We made clear that the further expansion of NATO in the East is not acceptable. We’re not the ones who came to the States with missiles. They’re the ones setting up missiles right on our doorstep,” he said. “And what if we set up missiles on the border of the U.S. and Canada? Or Mexico?” Visibly angry, he went on to vent frustration over the idea of a sovereign Ukraine, suggesting the country actually belongs to Vladimir Lenin. “And who did California belong to?” he asked, apparently referring to California being part of Mexico prior to the Mexican-American War. “And Texas? Did they forget that or something? Well okay, everyone has forgotten, and they don’t remember the way they now remember about Crimea. We also don’t remember who created Ukraine–Lenin Vladimir Ilyich, when he created the Soviet Union.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Get our top stories in your inbox every day. Sign up now!

12/23/2021,"Mariners traveling Florida waters will not have access to the east-west shortcut across Lake Okeechobee for three months beginning Jan. 4 — the busiest part of the state's boating season. That means boaters traveling between the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico must take an approximately 320-mile detour around the state's southern tip, adding 165 nautical miles and a couple of days for slower-moving vessels like sailboats and trawlers. This year, 3,305 boats passed through the St. Lucie Lock from Jan. 1 through Dec. 17, with about one-third of those (1,011) doing so during the first three months of 2021— the same time period the lock will be closed in 2022. St. Lucie River: This year's effects from Lake O discharges, toxic algae C-44 Reservoir: Will help St. Lucie River, but this columnist has 3 concerns LOSOM: What new Lake O plans means for the future of the St. Lucie River The Army Corps of Engineers announced it will need several months to dewater and repair the St. Lucie Lock, the structure boats must pass through to move between the C-44 Canal and the St. Lucie River. It's the first time in 26 years the lock has been closed for maintenance, according to Tammy Cleveland, the Corps' deputy chief of its South Florida office in Clewiston. A lock is an elevator for boats, which must be lifted or lowered at the St. Lucie Lock and Dam by about 14.5 feet, depending on the river's tide stage and the canal's water level. The St. Lucie Lock and Dam is one of five locks on the 154-mile-long Okeechobee Waterway. There are two east of the lake and three west of the lake along the C-43 Canal and Caloosahatchee River. All are operated by the Army Corps, and they lift boats traveling toward Lake Okeechobee and lower them as they travel away from it. The Army Corps website offers this technical information about the St. Lucie Lock: The Everglades Drainage District built the first lock there in 1925 It was redesigned in 1941 Initial construction cost about $2 million It usually takes 15 to 20 minutes to traverse the lock It's about 15 miles up the St. Lucie River's South Fork from where it crosses the Indian River Lagoon (The Crossroads). Chamber dimensions are 50 feet wide by 250 feet long by 10 feet deep at low water Chamber is made from concrete and steel sheet pile walls Lock gate is a steel sector gate (pie-slice shape) installed in concrete gate chambers, operated by rack and pinion drive. The lock is operated from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. 365 days a year, unless a major hurricane is approaching. The visitor center, observation decks and northside recreation area already were closed to the public, so workers could stage equipment there and prepare for the Jan. 4 lock closure. However, the nearby campground will remain open. An estimated 100,000 boaters bring their boats to Florida each winter and spring, according to Visit Florida. Mark Clarke keeps his boat on the hard at Indiantown Marina, whose location — at mile 29 of the Okeechobee Waterway, just west of the State Road 710 bridge — makes it an ideal hurricane hole. The entire Okeechobee Waterway is heavily used as a place to hide boats from damaging winds and storm surge when hurricanes approach. The marina has been abuzz with out-of-state boat owners preparing their vessels to move east of the St. Lucie Lock to avoid becoming stranded inland through the entire boating season, Clarke emailed TCPalm. ""I'm glad I'm sitting this one out,"" he wrote. ""I have never seen the marina so busy."" The marina has 40 wet slips, a 24-ton travel lift and acres of property to store boats. Boaters traveling east from there will have to head west over 125 miles before turning south and making way through the Florida Keys to head east up the coast. Boaters traveling west from there will not have any restrictions while the St. Lucie Lock is closed. ""There are a lot of boat owners who haven't been to the marina yet and others who are not ready to launch,"" Clarke wrote. ""They could lose out on most of the cruising season. I'll bet they will have some stories. It's a long way to Channel 5 in the Keys and then the Bahamas."" As one can imagine, the opening of the locks in the 1920s, and the reopening in 1941 after it was redesigned, was celebrated with much fanfare. The passageway across Florida was to be a conduit of economic viability for coastal towns on either end of the waterway, Stuart and Fort Myers. During its heyday, a large percentage of cargo was transported by barge. The Okeechobee Waterway served about 10,000 vessels a year. It was common for Martin County residents to hear tugboats pushing the barges down the river at night. Tugboat captains sounded horns to alert bridgetenders at the five drawbridges crossing the St. Lucie River and Indian River Lagoon at the time. Over the years, the tugs and barges went away as more goods and cargo were shipped by trucks and trains. Drawbridges were replaced by span bridges, negating the need for other boats to alert bridgetenders who are no longer there. Let's hope the Army Corps can complete this project swiftly and with no delays. For more information about the lock closure, go to saj.usace.army.mil. Ed Killer is TCPalm's outdoors writer.

12/23/2021,"ROME (AP) — Pope Francis urged Vatican cardinals, bishops and bureaucrats Thursday to embrace humility this Christmas season, saying their pride, self-interest and the “glitter of our armor” was perverting their spiritual lives and corrupting the church’s mission. As he has in the past, Francis used his annual Christmas address to take Vatican administrators to task for their perceived moral and personal failings, denouncing in particular those pride-filled clerics who “rigidly” hide behind Catholic Church traditions rather than seek out the neediest with humility. As they have in the past, cardinals and bishops sat stone-faced as they listened to Francis lecture them in the Hall of Blessings, which was otherwise decked out in jolly twinkling Christmas trees and poinsettias. “The humble are those who are concerned not simply with the past but also with the future, since they know how to look ahead, to spread their branches, remembering the past with gratitude,"" Francis told them. “The proud, on the other hand, simply repeat, grow rigid and enclose themselves in that repetition, feeling certain about what they know and fearful of anything new because they cannot control it."" The proud who are so inward-looking are consumed with their own interests, the pontiff said. “As a consequence, they neither learn from their sins nor are they genuinely open to forgiveness. This is a tremendous corruption disguised as a good. We need to avoid it,"" he added. Since becoming pope in 2013, Francis has used his Christmas address to rail against the Curia, as the Holy See's bureaucracy is known, denouncing the “spiritual Alzheimer’s” that some members suffer and the resistance he had encountered to his efforts to reform and revitalize the institution and the broader Catholic Church. Those reforms kicked into high gear this year, and some of the top Catholic hierarchy bore the brunt as Francis ordered a 10% pay cut for cardinals, imposed a 40-euro ($45) gift cap for Holy See personnel and passed a law allowing cardinals and bishops to be criminally prosecuted by the Vatican’s own tribunal. On top of that, Francis added his Christmas greetings in the form of another public brow-beating of Vatican clerics, who normally are treated with the utmost deference by their underling and the faithful at large. Francis told them to stop hiding behind the “armor” of their titles and to recognize that they, like the Biblical figure of Naaman, a wealthy and decorated general, were lepers in need of healing. “The story of Naaman reminds us that Christmas is the time when each of us needs to find the courage to take off our armor, discard the trappings of our roles, our social recognition and the glitter of this world and adopt the humility of Naaman,” he said. Francis also repeated his call for tradition-minded clerics to stop living in the past, saying their obsession with old doctrine and liturgy concealed a “spiritual worldliness” that was corrupting. “Seeking those kinds of reassurance is the most perverse fruit of spiritual worldliness, for it reveals a lack of faith, hope and love; it leads to an inability to discern the truth of things,” he said. Francis this year took his biggest step yet to rein in the traditionalist wing of the church, reimposing restrictions on celebrating the old Latin Mass that Pope Benedict XVI had relaxed in 2007. He intensified those restrictions last weekend with a new set of rules that forbids even the publication of Tridentine Mass times in parish bulletins. Francis said the proud who remain stuck in the past, “enclosed in their little world, have neither past nor future, roots or branches, and live with the bitter taste of a melancholy that weighs on their hearts as the most precious of the devil’s potions.” “All of us are called to humility, because all of us are called to remember and to give life. We are called to find a right relationship with our roots and our branches. Without those two things, we become sick, destined to disappear,” he warned.",World/Associated Press,Pope demands humility in new zinger-filled Christmas speech,https://news.yahoo.com/pope-demands-humility-zinger-filled-104146318.html
