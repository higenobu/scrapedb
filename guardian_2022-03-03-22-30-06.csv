3/3/2022,"A Canadian-Israeli ice hockey player has described his harrowing escape from Ukraine, as foreign athletes in both Ukraine and Russia face life-threatening decisions over whether to stay or go. Eliezer Sherbatov was with his team, HC Mariupol of the Ukrainian Hockey League, in the Donetsk region last week preparing for a game against Kramatorsk when a bomb exploded outside their hotel. “At 5am, I’m sleeping and hear: ‘Boom!’ You never hear that strong of a sound,” Sherbatov told TSN. “And it starts shaking, everything is shaking. So, a couple of metres away, the war started.” Sherbatov said the team’s coach called a meeting at breakfast, where he explained: “Guys - the war has started. It’s unfortunate, but I would suggest you to stay put as a team. But if you choose to leave, it’s your decision.’” Sherbatov said he and the team’s other European-Canadian eventually decided to go the local train station in Druzhkiva. The train to Lviv, however, was two days late. “We received a call that the trains are getting shot as of now. So, the third guy that was supposed to come with us, he tells me, ‘I’m not going because I don’t want to die.’ It’s a 50-50 … chance. That’s what they said. That’s a 50-50 chance, [if] you go on the train, you [may] die. Tell me, what would you do? What decision would you take? “You stay, you go to a bomb shelter, and you hope that a person doesn’t put a grenade inside the bomb shelter … Or you take the train and have a 50-50 chance at survival.” After speaking to his father and putting his trust in God, Sherbatov said, he decided to board the train. It travelled north-west through Kramatorsk and Kharkiv then west through Kyiv, all of which are under heavy assault by the Russian military. “Imagine how I felt in that 24 hours. I called this train the Train Of Death because every single second, you think you’re going to get shot,” he said. “It’s army everywhere – you just don’t know which [one].” After arriving in Lviv, Sherbatov was helped by the Latvian embassy and a team of Israeli volunteers, who he said put him in charge of a bus of children and elderly people leaving for Poland. “Nobody at the consulate was coming with us because they had to wait for others,” he said. “It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life, to be responsible for 17 people when it’s a matter of life and death.” On returning to Canada, Sherbatov was reunited with his family. “I met my son for the first time, and I thought I would never see them. I thought I would never see my family,” he said. “My daughter was sleeping … I hugged her and I just stayed there, just crying and stayed there. “When you think you’re not going to come back, you’re never going to see your parents, the only thing you want to do now is be with your family the rest of your life.” The Ukrainian Hockey League, where Sherbatov played for HC Mariupol, has suspended all operations because of the Russian invasion. The KHL, the largest hockey league outside of North America’s NHL, has also been affected by the war. The league is dominated by Russian clubs but two non-Russian teams, Jokerit of Finland and Dinamo Riga of Latvia, have dropped out because of the war. The league’s other non-Russian teams – Kunlun (China), Dinamo Minsk (Belarus) and Barys Nur-Sultan (Kazakhstan) – have yet to comment. Meanwhile, may of the KHL’s prominent western-born players are leaving, or attempting to leave Russia. Last week Markus Granlund of Finland broke his agreement with Salavat Yulaev Ufa just as the playoffs were beginning. Some North Americans are cancelling their contracts, too, including Shane Prince – who signed with Lugano of the Swiss league on 1 March – Geoff Platt and Nick Shore. KHL players are paid in rubles, and the currency is falling; journalist Chris Johnston has reported that agents operating in Russia fear for the long-term viability of the league. KHL goalkeeper Frans Tuohimaa of Finland – who defeated Russia in the gold medal game at the Winter Olympics less than a month ago – told the Yle Urheilu newspaper that he tried to break his agreement with Neftehimik Nizhnekamsk but was refused permission. “I do not feel insecure here, but I have my values ​​and for ethical reasons I want to leave. It feels wrong to be here,” Tuohimaa said. Sixteen players and five coaches from Finland remain in the KHL. Meanwhile Russia’s most famous hockey player, Alexander Ovechkin, has attracted headlines by calling for “No more war”, despite forming a pro-Putin social media organisation in 2017 and accusing the Ukrainian government of being fascists in 2014, when Russian annexed Crimea.",Sport/Sport,"‘If you go on the train, you may die’: ice hockey player’s terrifying escape from Ukraine",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/03/eliezer-sherbatov-israeli-canadian-ice-hockey-player-escape-ukraine
3/3/2022,"Russia’s aerospace and aviation sectors will be blocked from accessing insurance through the UK market, as part of Britain’s latest efforts to put pressure on Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine. The legislation, which is to be put before parliament in the coming days, will prevent UK-based insurance or reinsurance firms from offering contracts linked to Russia, whose businesses and oligarchs are already facing a raft of UK, US and EU sanctions. The rules could come into force as early as next week, and are intended to “severely limit” the industries’ access to global markets, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, tweeted on Thursday, as Russian forces continued to attack cities across Ukraine. “Coupled with similar actions by the EU, this move further isolates Russia’s economy from the international financial system,” the Treasury added. Neither the Lloyd’s of London insurance market nor the Treasury were able to immediately confirm the value of soon-to be blocked insurance contracts. It was also unclear whether the rules would require insurers to cancel existing contracts, or just block new transactions. Russian companies in the aviation or space industry will now be prevented from making use of UK-based insurance or reinsurance services directly or indirectly.This measure will severely limit their access to the global insurance and reinsurance market. The sanctions have so far targeted two industries in which London, and Lloyd’s in particular, are considered global leaders. The UK is also a leader in the maritime insurance industry, but British sanctions have largely avoided targeting industries like shipping. The EU has also avoided such sanctions, which could effect energy supplies, given the bloc’s reliance on Russian oil and gas. However, it is understood that the Treasury is considering expanding the sanctions to ban other Russia-linked industries. “We are in regular communications with the UK government and international regulators, and are working closely with the Lloyd’s market to uphold the implementation, at pace, of sanctions applied by governments around the world,” Patrick Tiernan, chief of markets at Lloyd’s. “We continue to monitor the unfolding situation in Ukraine and our thoughts are first and foremost with those people directly affected,” he added.",News/Business,Russian air and space firms to be denied access to UK insurance,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/03/russian-air-and-space-sectors-to-be-denied-access-to-uk-insurance
3/3/2022,"Dockers who vowed not to unload a tanker of Russian gas that was due to arrive at a Thames Estuary port in the early hours of Friday morning have scored a victory, after the ship was diverted, the Guardian understands. The Boris Vilkitskiy was on its way to the Isle of Grain with a consignment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for Centrica, the owner of British Gas, due to an apparent loophole on Russian-associated ships imposed by the Department for Transport. But after dockers represented by the trade union Unison warned they would rebel against any instruction to help bring the gas onshore, the ship will no longer dock at the Kent facility. Tankers carrying oil and gas are still arriving at or heading towards ports around the country, including Foyle Port in Derry and Liverpool. But National Grid, which operates the Isle of Grain LNG terminal, confirmed it was now no longer expecting any deliveries of Russian gas. “This will come as a relief to the Grain terminal workers,” said Matt Lay, Unison’s national officer for energy. “But while it looks like the union’s intervention has been successful in seeing these ships turned away, a more fundamental problem remains.” He pointed out that ships bearing Russian oil and gas are still able to dock at British ports because the DfT’s ban does not cover the origin of vessels’ cargo, despite the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, saying earlier this week that the measure extended to “all ships with any Russian connection whatsoever”. “The government must act immediately to close this loophole and stop Russian goods continuing to arrive in the UK under the cover of another country,” said Lay. While the Boris Vilkitskiy will no longer dock at Isle of Grain, a tanker called the Pluto was moored at Foyle Port, Northern Ireland on Thursday, while the Seacod, bringing oil from the Primosk terminal that accounts for 30% of Russian oil exports, was anchored off Liverpool. The UK could spend an average of more than £6m a day on Russian gas this year, according to analysts at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU). They estimated that the spend would reach £2.3bn this year at a wholesale gas price of 200p/therm, if imports continue at the rate seen in 2021. “Although not at the same level of some other European countries, the UK has been spending billions of pounds on Russian gas that could now be being used to fund Putin’s war in Ukraine,” said Simon Cran-McGreehin, the unit’s head of analysis. “This is another reason why the UK needs to break its dependency on gas – and insulating our homes, deploying electric heat pumps and shifting from gas power stations to renewables is the way to do it.” The analysis came as the International Energy Agency released a 10-point plan for reducing the European Union’s reliance on supplies controlled by the Kremlin.

3/3/2022,"Spain’s self-exiled former king, Juan Carlos, is thought to be considering a return home after prosecutors shelved three separate investigations into his financial affairs, citing insufficient evidence, the statute of limitations, and the monarch’s constitutional immunity. The 84-year-old left Spain for Abu Dhabi in August 2020 after a series of damaging allegations were made about his business dealings that further dented his already battered reputation and embarrassed his son, King Felipe. In March 2020, Felipe stripped Juan Carlos of his annual stipend and renounced his own personal inheritance from his father after reports that he was in line to receive millions of euros from a secret offshore fund with ties to Saudi Arabia. Three months later, Spain’s supreme court launched an investigation into the former king’s role in a deal in which a Spanish consortium landed a €6.7bn (£5.9bn) contract to build a high-speed rail line between the Saudi cities of Medina and Mecca. On Wednesday, however, the public prosecutor’s office announced that it was dropping all investigations into the former king on various grounds. It said in a statement: “The public prosecutor wishes to make it clear that, despite the investigation … no criminal action can be taken against His Majesty Juan Carlos de Borbón for the reasons outlined in the decree – basically the lack of incriminating evidence, the statute of limitations, the inviolability of the head of state, and tax regularisation.” While noting that prosecutors had identified “sums defrauded from the Inland Revenue relating to personal income tax between 2008 and 2012”, it said the possible offences in question had either expired or were covered by inviolability. The statement also pointed out that prosecutors’ efforts had led to the recovery of more than €5m, which Juan Carlos paid to the tax authorities earlier this year. One of the key lines of inquiry was the nature of the €65m that Saudi Arabia’s late King Abdullah paid into a Swiss bank account to which Juan Carlos had access in 2008. The former king’s lawyers described the sum as a gift or donation, but suspicions had arisen that it was a commission paid to Juan Carlos for his part in the rail deal. “The investigation has not been able to establish, even indirectly, any link between the aforementioned sum of €64,884,405 and the awarding of the project for the construction of a high-speed rail line in Saudi Arabia, nor, similarly, has it found that the sum was related to any kind of commission,” the statement said. Even if the payment had been a gift or bribe, it added, the statute of limitations for the offence “has clearly expired”. Similarly, any possible money laundering offences relating to the sum’s subsequent handling would have been covered by the king’s constitutional inviolability, which lapsed only when he stepped down in 2014. Prosecutors also said they were shelving investigations into Juan Carlos’s possible undeclared use of credit cards linked to accounts not registered to his name, and into offshore accounts held in the tax haven of Jersey. The former monarch’s lawyer, Javier Sánchez-Junco, said the public prosecutor’s statement had concluded that “there were no circumstances to suggest the existence of any illegal conduct on the part of His Majesty Juan Carlos de Borbón – nor of any conduct that may be liable to criminal reproof”. Sánchez-Junco said he would travel to see the former king in the coming days to discuss the matter. “After examining and evaluating the issues next week, I will share any decisions Don Juan Carlos might make at the appropriate time,” he added. Despite the shelving of the investigations in Spain, Juan Carlos’s legal issues are not over elsewhere. His former lover, the Danish businesswoman Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, has brought action against him at the high court in London, claiming he used Spain’s spy agency to target and harass her and her children after their five-year relationship ended. In a skeleton argument presented to the court in December last year, lawyers for Sayn-Wittgenstein said she was seeking damages for the “great mental pain, alarm, anxiety, distress, loss of wellbeing, humiliation and moral stigma she has suffered”. The former king’s lawyers have rejected “the allegations made against him, and any alleged wrongdoing by the Spanish state is denied in the strongest of terms”. They have also argued that Juan Carlos would have been covered by sovereign immunity at the time in question. That case continues. The former monarch, who was long praised for the role he played in returning Spain to democracy after the Franco dictatorship, abdicated eight years ago amid plummeting popularity.

3/3/2022,"A Ukraine-born oligarch has been found dead at his home in unexplained circumstances, Surrey police have said. Officers are treating the death of 66-year-old Mikhail Watford, who made his fortune in oil and gas after the demise of the Soviet Union, as unexplained. But they said it was not thought to be suspicious. The news comes as attention focuses on oligarchs in the UK who are thought to be members of Vladimir Putin’s inner circle, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It follows the attempted murder on UK soil of the former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, which the Kremlin is accused of ordering, as well as other attacks blamed on Russian authorities. There is no suggestion, however, that Watford has been the target of British-backed sanctions owing to a proximity to Putin, or of a Russian operation. Surrey police said his body was found on Monday at an address near Virginia Water, between Slough and Woking, to the west of London. “We were called around midday on Monday 28 February following reports of the discovery of a man’s body at an address in Portnall Drive, Wentworth,” a spokesperson said. “An ambulance was called but the man, who was in his 60s, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin are aware and are being supported by specially trained officers. An investigation into the circumstances of the death is under way but it is not believed there are any suspicious circumstances at this time.” Watford was born Mikhail Tolstosheya in Ukraine in 1955, during the country’s Soviet era. He was commonly known as Misha and, according to the Sunday Times, anglicised his surname after moving to the UK. He initially settled in London, where he lived with his Estonian wife, Jane, before moving to Surrey. The paper reported that Watford considered that his childhood, spent in a “big four-bedroom apartment with a bath, and a car,” was very comfortable in Soviet-era Ukraine. “In terms of luxury, [it] was the equivalent of travelling by jet now,” he told the paper in 2015. His mother, who the Sun reported lived in a neighbouring apartment in his villa and was at home when his body was found, was said to have insisted on keeping her Soviet ID in a safe. “She strongly believes communists will be back to Russia and Ukraine. Meanwhile, she’s enjoying modest spending of her capitalist son’s money … And we are praying her dream never comes true,” Watford told the Sunday Times. According to the paper, he had three children: Michael, his son by his first marriage; his and Jane’s daughter, Michelle; and their youngest, Alexander.",News/UK news,Ukraine-born oligarch Mikhail Watford found dead at home in Surrey,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/03/ukraine-born-oligarch-mikhail-watford-found-dead-at-home-in-surrey

3/3/2022,"Visions of pastel-clad fairies playing in an elysian woodland are quickly dispelled in the opening moments of Scottish Opera’s new production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Director Dominic Hill, artistic director of Glasgow’s Citizens Theatre, has reimagined Britten’s opera as a dystopian psychodrama. Tom Piper’s set is a mid-20th century interior, all mirrored glass walls, overturned chairs and beds appearing to float high above the stage. Here, night is a time of uncertainty and even fear, presided over by fairies costumed like something out of a Tim Burton gothic fantasy. It’s an effective visual counterpoint to Britten’s multi-layered score, in which the lush romanticism of the lovers’ music and the deceptively simple writing for the comedy of the rustics is contrasted with the eerie percussion-inflected way he conjures up the fairy realm. Britten’s masterclass in orchestration can sometimes make the opera coolly impressive rather than truly engaging, but the commitment of Hill’s production doesn’t allow this to happen. And although the Freudian undertones add subtle layers of meaning to the production, ultimately the main strengths here are its delightfully slick physicality and superb musical values. Dream is a work for an ensemble cast and Scottish Opera has found a uniformly strong company, including an excellent children’s chorus as the mischievous fairy retinue. The standout performances, perhaps inevitably, are from countertenor Lawrence Zazzo, malevolent but disturbingly seductive as fairy king Oberon, well met here by Catriona Hewitson’s ethereal and otherworldly fairy queen Tytania. In the speaking role of Puck, Michael Guest is slyly sinuous and quicksilver, acting as much through physicality as with voice. The addition of the puppet changeling boy, with puppeteer Caleb Hughes, is suitably creepy and yet affecting. The rustics’ play, which Britten reimagines as an opera-within-the-opera is a point where audience goodwill can start to falter, coming as it does after the two-hour mark. Here, however, it emerges triumphant due to the sure-footed comic timing of the motley crew of rustics led by David Shipley’s larger-than-life Nick Bottom. The role of Flute the bellows mender (written for Britten’s partner Peter Pears) offers a minor scene-stealing opportunity that Scottish Opera emerging artist Glen Cunningham seizes with both hands, transforming from shy, stuttering lad to campy 19th-century operatic heroine with visual and vocal glee. Under conductor Stuart Stratford, the Orchestra of Scottish Opera reveal Britten’s score in beautifully delineated detail, the pacing sure-footed without feeling rushed.  At the Festival theatre, Edinburgh, until 5 March.

3/3/2022,"In 2010 I was approached on behalf of a Russian multimillionaire offering £30m. I’d recently launched a philanthropic foundation to help grassroots charities cope with the aftermath of the financial crisis. We attracted a lot of support from individuals with genuine motives, but soon we were being approached by professional philanthropy advisers – a recently established money-making trade created by wealth managers and “private offices”. But on this occasion an adviser from a luxury concierge firm told us it had a Russian client willing to give us a huge sum to help us start up. But there were strings attached. The client and his wife had to be invited to charity events attended by royalty, politicians, celebs and opinion formers. We would have to seek out big-brand arts and culture organisations, high-profile sports such as polo, and several named military charities, taking them on as trustees or board members. And they would have to have a say on the charities we funded, including charities in Belarus and Romania. These demands rang alarm bells. The adviser boasted that he had helped this family to set up a charitable trust and other lucrative services that were earning his firm fat fees. Even back then, questions were raised about the ability to move large sums of money out of Russia without permission from Vladimir Putin. There was a lot of good we could have done with such a vast sum, but it would have compromised all my principles. The Conservative party and some of its MPs – Boris Johnson and David Cameron among them – have, of course, been less choosy. This is what makes it very difficult for the prime minister to talk with any credibility about making life tough for rich Russians: he has defended donations made to his party by close Putin associates. On this issue, he is only now keen to talk the talk – but he still won’t walk the walk: there are no timelines or details about enacting laws to clean up “Londongrad”, or indeed dirty money flowing in from numerous dubious sources around the world. It is generally assumed that Russians often pump their roubles into our society because they crave social respectability. On the contrary, it has long been part of a systematic attempt to destabilise our institutions, most notably our parliament, press and democracy. Johnson and consecutive Conservative governments have been well aware that the lack of transparency over this cash was a scandal waiting to be exposed. But they have been willing to turn a blind eye for as long as they could benefit. The ecosystem of enablers includes wealth managers, banks, private equity houses, accountants, lawyers – and the growing army of philanthropy advisers, lobbyists, and thinktanks – who have been complicit in the infiltration by those close to Putin of not just our political infrastructure, but our property market, businesses, charities, public bodies, arts, culture, and sports. I have crossed paths with many of these during my time vocally campaigning against dodgy practices in the City, and remember that many of us were shocked that in 2018, the British government allowed Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch with links to companies that produce Russian military equipment, to raise an estimated £1bn on the London stock exchange. US security services concluded that examples like this impacted on the government’s ability to tackle important national security issues. Nor should we ignore the impact of Russian money on the Brexit campaign. In a 2017 Guardian article, I wrote: “Think of Brexit as a matryoshka, or a Russian nesting doll, with voting to leave the EU as the outer doll … Pulling off the outer doll reveals another doll that represents something much more worrying.” Today, the rot has been exposed, but words are not enough to restore the reputation and integrity of our institutions. What we need is a raft of robust “cleaning-up” laws, including more stringent checks and due diligence before new organisations can register with Companies House or the Charity Commission, greater scrutiny of trustees, and a register of funders of thinktanks. Professional services must use their expertise and insight to protect the stability and security of our country, and the wider western world – they should not be facilitators of the kind of evil we are now seeing in Ukraine. Johnson’s government is at least now making some attempts to close loopholes that have for too long allowed dark money into London, making it the money laundering capital of the world. It is time for us to remember that there are some things that money must not be allowed to buy – our morals and integrity.

3/3/2022,"He would bristle at the term but you might describe Dylan Schultz as a crypto bro. He runs Lavender.Five, a crypto validator service that authenticates transactions on the blockchain (imagine a deregulated branch of the Securities and Exchange Commission). On 25 February, he issued a plea to his 1,700 Twitter followers, “We’ll match any donation made to a charity in support of Ukraine, up to a total of $1,000.” The next day, Schultz posted the fruits of his initiative; 0.028 bitcoin, equaling the total donations of about $1,100, sent to a crypto wallet operated by a Ukrainian military NGO called Come Back Alive. He’s one tiny part of a chorus of countless other crypto holders all over the world who’ve raced to back Ukrainians in the face of an invading force. Reports claim that more than $30m in cryptocurrency has been funneled to the country since the war began. So has charity finally become decentralized? “I decided early on that Lavender.Five would use its platform to make a positive difference, no matter how small,” says Schultz. “Crypto is inherently worldwide. To donate using traditional currency often requires intermediaries. You can’t donate USD directly, you first need to convert it in some way, or find an intermediary. … Cryptocurrency solves this by simplifying the process. If you have the address for the charity, you can simply enter the address, enter the amount to donate, and hit send.” Ukraine, like many former Soviet states, has battled corruption and a severe dearth of international funding since gaining independence in 1991. So maybe that is why the Ukrainian government took the unusual step of tweeting out crypto wallet codes for global financing through both bitcoin and Ethereum – the two most popular digital tokens – from official accounts. “Stand with the people of Ukraine Now accepting cryptocurrency donations,” wrote Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s vice-prime minister, on 26 February. Nonprofits and local businesses in the besieged country have mirrored the government’s request. The Kyiv Independent, an English language newspaper in the capital city, is accepting patronage through bitcoin. Come Back Alive, the NGO that Schultz contributed to, was previously active on Patreon – processing traditional currency donations – before being terminated from the platform because it violated an existing moratorium on military fundraisers. Naturally, the firm found a second life thanks to a “crypto collective” called UkraineDAO which is collecting decentralized aid for a variety of Ukrainian organizations. As the state is gradually dragged into brutal urban warfare, perhaps it makes sense that the residents are petitioning for an untrackable currency – particularly as donations can be anonymous and therefore avoid any retaliation from the Russian state. “Blockchain allows us to scale our efforts in a way that wasn’t possible for us before,” said Nadya Tolokonnikova, a spokeswoman for Ukraine DAO, in an interview with The New York Times. “The old ways of raising money sometimes are really slow and just clumsy.” For the most ardent cryptocurrency diehards, the crisis in Ukraine is a perfect encapsulation of the reasons why they believe the global economic hegemony needs to be broken up. The Ukrainian people need help, and they argue that bitcoin’s ability to eschew bureaucratic red tape is the best way to provide immediate service to a vulnerable population. “It’s just the cheapest, fastest, and most secure way to transact financially,” says Artemis, who declined to offer his real name but says he’s from Canada and donated $280 in bitcoin to Come Back Alive. “They can safely store it without any fear of the invading force stealing it, or the banking system collapsing due to war.” That said, donors still need to be doing their due diligence to avoid potential scams, particularly in a chaotic active war zone. Nobody should trust a stray crypto wallet floating through social media without corroborating the details. Especially when there are organizations such as The Giving Block, a charity curator that opens up blockchain pathways to nonprofits, which requires a vetting process to be featured on the platform. Even in the wild west of crypto, it is possible for patrons to know their alms are going to the right place – although not all the Ukrainian groups currently accepting crypto donations have opened themselves up to this kind of transparency. There’s also plenty of evidence that the crypto revolution could threaten the Ukrainian homefront. Foreign policy experts are warning that the Russian economy could become increasingly reliant on the blockchain as crippling sanctions wreak havoc on Moscow. The ruble is worth less than one cent after a 30% swoon after the US and Europe cut off Russian banks from Swift. Crypto is much more resistant to punitive financial assault, and that provides an escape route for a country that’s been completely isolated from civic banking. “It is most likely already happening. We know Russia is already developing its own digital currency, the digital ruble, that it will use to trade globally. Sanctions aimed at hurting Putin will only hurt the Russian people. What is certain is that Putin has already thought about this prior to the conflict with Ukraine and has a plan that probably involves crypto,” says Mark Bosa, HOKK Finance global brand and business manager. The war efforts, on both sides, may be funded in the inky blackness of the blockchain. Crypto is often simultaneously a force for good and a force for evil, but the stakes of that dichotomy have never been quite this high. For his part, Schultz intends to keep supporting Ukrainians with his tokens. “Ukraine didn’t want this, and is fighting the battle on their own,” she says. “I wanted to help however I can, by reaching as many as I can.”",News/Technology,Every bitcoin helps: why Ukraine is soliciting for cryptocurrency donations,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/03/bitcoin-donations-cryptocurrency-support-ukraine
3/3/2022,"Concern is mounting over the movements of a huge column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv, amid a lack of fresh information about its position and the threat it poses. While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have “stalled”, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping, and potentially waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on Kyiv. Efforts to ascertain the status of the convoy and the threat it poses have been set back by recent cloud cover over Ukraine that has prevented Maxar Technologies – which issued the first satellite images of the convoy – from releasing new pictures. “Heavy cloud cover has blanketed Ukraine,” said Maxar, “and [it has] prevented us from providing new satellite imagery-based updates of the current activity.” While information about Russian troop movements in other parts of Ukraine where there has been fighting has been well documented on social media, the convoy outside Kyiv has existed in what amounts to an information black hole, suggesting that Russia forces may closely control the territory around it. The convoy, which at one stage was reportedly about 40 miles (65km) in length, with vehicles pictured three abreast on the P02 road to the immediate north of Kyiv, includes armoured vehicles, tanks, trucks, fuel tankers and artillery pieces. Its presence suggested Russian forces were massing for an attack on Kyiv. Western defence assessments in the UK and US, however, put a more optimistic slant on the convoy’s apparent lack of progress, although it was not clear what evidence that was based on. The UK’s Ministry of Defence tweeted: “The main body of the large Russian column advancing on Kyiv remains over 30km from the centre of the city, having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion. The column has made little discernible progress in over three days.” The Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby, in a press briefing on Wednesday, gave a more nuanced assessment, saying there had been limited movement from the military force and that it “remain[ed] stalled”. However, he cautioned that lack of movement could be due to Russia’s forces regrouping. Saying that the convoy had “not made any appreciable progress, geographically speaking, in the last 24-36 hours”, Kirby added: “In general we believe there are a couple of reasons for that. One reason is we believe the Russians are deliberately regrouping themselves and reassessing the progress that they have not made and how to make up the lost time. “Two, we do believe that they have experienced logistic and sustainment challenges. Challenges that we don’t believe they fully anticipated. Three, they are getting resistance from the Ukrainians. We have some indications, nothing that we can 100% verify, that the Ukrainians have indeed tried to slow down that convoy.”",News/World news,Concern mounting over huge Russian military convoy outside Kyiv,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/concern-mounting-huge-russian-military-convoy-outside-kyiv-ukraine

I thought I might make a new friend out of it. Michelle I was expecting to butt heads, maybe. I don’t do that on purpose. But I thought we’d be really different. Victoria I had the scotch egg, the cod and chips, and the lemon tart. I ate everything. I’m still full. Michelle Scotch egg for starter, roast pork for main and lemon tart. Victoria She’s an absolute Harry and Meghan fan – not a royalist at all. I am very much in favour of the royal family. She was talking about the point of them, and I have to be aware of this, from a creative industries perspective. The royals bring in £1.4bn a year to the economy. Generally they cost us £80m. There’s no comparison. I think she took that on board. Michelle She knew all the figures for tourist income, and I can see the argument. But I thought, would people still visit Buckingham Palace without the royal family? It might be better if they weren’t there – we might get to see more rooms. Victoria Prince William is doing a great job. He’s turning into an excellent young man. Well, I say that – he’s nearly 40. I remember the day after Meghan’s interview, the press shouted a question to William, who said: “We are not a racist family.” And I thought: “I like that – he’s going to start standing up for them.” Michelle But are the royal family not racist? Michelle We had a conversation about living standards, but it was more about humanity. I was talking about the fact that my mum’s going to retire and I don’t understand how she’s going to live on a state pension. She might have to move to a flat, so her heating bills would be reduced. Victoria and I are both middle class – we have homes, jobs, careers. It’s so interesting what it takes before middle class people talk about things like this: it has to hit us. Victoria We are looking at people having to choose between food and heating, and I’m not entirely sure I won’t be in that category. We talked about whether Boris Johnson should step in and do something about rising bills. I don’t really know where I stand on that. She was brilliant on energy companies. She said: “I think we should renationalise all of them.” Michelle I reckon she’s a lot more leftwing than she thinks she is. Victoria I find having a conversation with most young people today, if they don’t like what you’re saying, they have this cancel culture going on. Generally, if they’re under 30, the minute you say anything they don’t like, they have anxiety. And you’re thinking, “We’re just having a chat.” Michelle She used the word “snowflake” and I hate that word. I find that it’s the older people in my life who won’t talk to me about these things. I don’t expect everybody to share my views, as long as you’re not arguing against someone’s humanity. Victoria She’s very Corbynite. I would never have voted for Jeremy Corbyn, and I’d never vote for Keir Starmer. When Boris was coming in, I was very pro, but he’s made such a mess of it. Michelle We talked about the Tory government, these parties that have come out. I found the pandemic so isolating. When the first lockdown hit, you couldn’t have support bubbles. I was suddenly locked in the house with a four-year-old and a two-year-old. It still impacts my mental health now. Victoria It was an absolutely brilliant afternoon. I got out of it exactly what I wanted – some really great conversations, a few ideas on things that I’d never thought of. Michelle It felt as if were still talking as the restaurant staff were turning the lights out. It was almost like going on a date with a friend.

3/3/2022,"Nilüfer Yanya’s 2019 debut album, Miss Universe, was a thrilling mess of ideas. It came bound together by a concept satirising the wellness industry – fake adverts between tracks, press releases that purported to be communiques from a company called Wway Health – that was less interesting than the music it contained. Then again, you could see why Yanya thought the music needed tying together somehow. Its contents jumped from ragged alt-rock to radio-friendly pop to lo-fi takes on 80s soft rock: there were traces of house music alongside cathartic old-fashioned indie, jagged guitars co-existed with the smooth sound of the saxophone, played by her impressively named foil Jazzi Bobbi. It was justly critically acclaimed: Yanya was clearly a skilled songwriter regardless of whatever genre she was toying with. But it was also audibly a debut album, the unmistakable sound of a young artist with eclectic taste letting everything they had absorbed in their teens gush forth. It’s an entirely understandable thing to do: who knows if your first chance to make an album that reaches a mass audience might also be your last? Three years on, Painless is audibly a second album, the product of an artist with eclectic tastes spending their time focusing and refining their talent – as if its author has developed the confidence to decide that less is sometimes more. Opener The Dealer does a lot with almost nothing more than a slackly strummed electric guitar, a crunchy breakbeat and some ghostly curls of synthesiser. It’s so minimal that when the bass starts playing during the chorus, it feels like a sonic eruption: it’s also a fantastic song. There’s also the sense of someone peeling layers away in order to concentrate on the kind of subtle details that repay repeat listening: the vocals that shift from speaker to speaker in L/R; the brief moment in Shameless where everything else drops away, leaving only a piano overlaid with drones; the understated shifts in the texture of Belong With You’s backing. Yanya’s voice, which on Miss Universe had a tendency to rocket between a bruised croon and a faintly unnerving falsetto, feels cooler, settling into a space between breathy vulnerability and something tougher, a kind of nonchalant mumble that frequently mangles her lyrics into a semi-comprehensible state. And the falsetto is deployed more sparingly – and to greater impact, as when it ratchets up the tension on Chase Me. There’s no superfluous concept attached. It holds together as it is, rooting its sound in the left-field guitar rock of the late 80s and early 90s without ever feeling beholden to it: a case of someone adapting inspirations to her own ends rather than re-creating. You assume Yanya likes the Breeders – listen to the dynamic shifts in Midnight Sun or Belong With You – and there’s no mistaking the echo of shoegaze in the thick, misty guitar textures, or in the gusts of scraping noise that blow through Trouble. But Yanya replaces that genre’s swooning, stoned languor with something more prickly and disquieting, which chimes with the mood of the words. When you can make them out, the lyrics frequently seem to depict the songs’ protagonists succumbing to something or someone that they’re aware isn’t entirely healthy. “Take me out to the beach / Take off all your clothes / Whatever makes you happy,” she murmurs on L/R, a suggestion that jars with what’s come before: “Sometimes you’re so violent, autopilot.” The characters in Stabilise could be blissfully cocooned – there could be a lascivious smirk about the line “I’m going downstairs, I’ve got the keys, you’re going nowhere” – or they could just be trapped together: “I’m going nowhere until it bleeds.” On Shameless, meanwhile, she sounds like someone throwing caution to the wind in pursuit of a good time – “in these four walls we’re stateless … I’m shameless” – but the question of exactly how good a time she’s letting herself in for hangs heavy: “You can hate me if you feel like / You can hurt me if you feel like / If it feels good, then I’m alright.” All this mystery is set to uniformly beautiful melodies. Around the time of Miss Universe’s release, interviewers tended to alight on the story of Yanya swerving an invitation to join a ghastly-sounding girl group manufactured by One Direction’s Louis Tomlinson. It clearly wasn’t an experience that put her off pop music – albeit pop music rendered in an intriguingly opaque manner: there’s nothing here that carries the straightforward sugar rush of her debut album’s Baby Blu. As with her musical forebears, Nilüfer Yanya seems interested only in doing it her way. As Painless plays, that very much feels like the right way.
