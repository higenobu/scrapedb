The family, which owns almost half the Boston-based company, is now worth $48 billion, an increase of $6.2 billion. Fidelity and its competitors spent much of last year courting the flood of individual investors who entered the market during the pandemic as stocks and other risky assets soared in value, even creating a new type of brokerage account to give teenagers access to financial markets. The company said in August it would make 9,000 new hires across the U.S. by the end of 2021 amid a boom in retail trading. An increase in the number of retail accounts helped push Fidelity’s discretionary assets to $4.5 trillion, up 18% from a year earlier, according to the firm’s annual report released Wednesday. Its revenue rose to $24 billion, up from $21 billion, with operating income of $8.1 billion. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index calculates that Fidelity is worth $74.8 billion, an increase of $12 billion, based on data in the report. Susan Coburn, a spokeswoman for Fidelity, declined to comment.

3/10/2022,"By Shariq Khan BENGALURU (Reuters) -Global oil prices fell on Wednesday by the most in nearly two years after OPEC member the United Arab Emirates said it supported pumping more oil into a market roiled by supply disruptions due to sanctions on Russia after it invaded Ukraine. Brent crude futures settled down $16.84, or 13.2%, at $111.14 a barrel, their biggest one-day decline since April 21, 2020. U.S. crude futures ended down $15.44, or 12.5%, at $108.70, their biggest daily decline since November. ""We favor production increases and will be encouraging OPEC to consider higher production levels,"" Ambassador Yousuf Al Otaiba said in a statement tweeted by the UAE Embassy in Washington. The UAE and neighbour Saudi Arabia are among the few members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with spare capacity that could increase output. The United States has called on oil producers worldwide to increase production if they can. ""In this moment of crisis we need more supply,"" U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told attendees at an industry event in Houston. ""Right now we need oil and gas production to rise to meet current demand."" Additional supply from OPEC could compensate for some supply shortfalls created by disruption to Russia's oil sales by economic sanctions imposed by the United States and other governments. ""That (potential output hike) is not nothing. They (UAE) can probably bring about 800,000 barrels to the market very quickly, even immediately, bringing us one-seventh of the way there in replacing Russian supply,"" said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho. OPEC's language shifted this week when its Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo said supply is increasingly lagging behind demand. Just a week ago, the group and its allies, known as OPEC+, blamed surging prices on geopolitics rather than any lack of supply and decided against increasing output any faster. OPEC+, which includes Russia, has been targeting an increase in output of 400,000 barrels per day every month, and had resisted demands from the United States and other consuming countries to pump more. Russia is the world's top exporter of crude and fuel, shipping around 7 million bpd or 7% of global supplies. Oil prices had already fallen during the session after the International Energy Agency said crude reserves could be tapped further. ""If there's a need, if our governments decide so, we can bring more oil to the markets, as one part of the response,"" said IEA chief Faith Birol. Birol said the IEA decision last week to release 60 million barrels of oil from strategic reserves was ""an initial response."" U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve levels fell last week to their lowest since July 2002, as the Biden administration had already approved releases in November as part of a larger effort to boost the U.S. fuel supply.

3/10/2022,"Britain slaps sanctions on Roman Abramovich Roman Abramovich assets: the cars, houses, yachts – and Chelsea FC FTSE 100 falls 1pc as market rebound runs out of steam Ben Wright: The City has failed to grasp the repercussions of Putin’s horrific war Sign up here for our daily business briefing newsletter​ Fears are mounting over gas supplies to Europe after Russian troops took control of key energy facilities in Ukraine. The operator of Ukraine’s gas pipelines said Russian forces were at more than one gas compressor station, posing a potential threat to smooth gas transit to Europe. Ukrainian authorities demanded that the military and armed groups leave the sites immediately and “stop trying to influence the operation”. European nations are scrambling to find alternative sources of gas amid fears Moscow could turn off the taps. Alexander Novak, Russia’s deputy prime minister, has said the country would have “every right” to cut supplies in retaliation against western sanctions. Lush has become the latest company to cut ties with Russia. The cosmetics company said it had suspended supplies to its Russian licence holder and halted online sales in the country. It's also in the process of acquiring the shares in Lush Ukraine not currently held by the group in an effort to secure the business. Lush's businesses in Russia and Ukraine are associate companies, both 65pc owned by a Russian citizen. It has 48 shops in Russia and 15 in Ukraine. Russia and Belarus are “mightily close” to default as western sanctions cripple their economies, the World Bank has warned. Louis Ashworth has the details: Carmen Reinhart, the development organisation’s chief economist, said both countries are now in “square default territory”, putting payments on about $40bn of external bonds at risk. “They're not rated by the agencies as a selective default yet, but mighty close,” she said. A large-scale default would be Russia’s first since the aftermath of the Bolshevik revolution in 1917. “I worry about what I do not see,” Ms Reinhart said. “Financial institutions are well-capitalised, but balance sheets are often opaque… there is the issue of Russian private sector defaults. One cannot be complacent.” Ratings agency Fitch has already cut Russia’s sovereign debt rating to “C”, deep in junk territory, warning a default is “imminent” as Moscow is increasingly frozen out of the global financial system. S&P, another ratings agency, cut Russia and Belarus to a “CCC” rating last week, with analysts saying they were awaiting more clarity on the ability or willingness of Moscow to pay its debts. ​Read Louis' full story here Calls for a windfall tax are likely to mount after Shell revealed its boss pocketed a £1.1m pay rise last year. Ben van Beurden took home €7.4m (£6.3m ), up from €5.8m (£5.2m) the previous year, the company revealed today. Shell has cashed in on the recent surge in oil and gas prices, causing its profits to increase 14-fold last year to a record high. Labour politicians and campaigners have called for a windfall tax on energy giants such as Shell as households feel the strain of higher bills. However, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has dismissed the calls, saying such a policy would harm investment. While Mr van Beurden's pay rose sharply last year, it's still lower than before the pandemic. It's also far below the £17.2m he made in 2018. The price of petrol and diesel in the UK has extended its recent rally to hit fresh record highs. The average price of petrol rose to 159.57p per litre – up 1.4p from the previous day – according to the RAC. Diesel jumped by 2pc to 167.37p. Surging oil prices in the wake of the Ukraine crisis have driven fuel prices ever higher, adding to the squeeze on household budgets. But the RAC said yesterday's sharp drop in wholesale oil – the biggest in three months – offered some hope. Simon Williams at the RAC said: There was a hint of better news yesterday on the wholesale market with substantial drops in both petrol and diesel, which could lead, in a week or so, to a slight slowing in the daily pump price increases and record being broken less frequently. Roman Abramovich has built up a global empire spanning businesses, luxury properties, artwork, cars, private jets and superyachts, alongside his investment in Chelsea Football Club. Now, though, the billionaire has been hit with a string of sanctions as the Government clamps down on oligarchs. But which assets have been frozen? Matt Oliver and Simon Foy have compiled a list: Roman Abramovich assets: the cars, houses, yachts – and Chelsea FC Trading in Evraz shares has been halted after after new sanctions targeting Roman Abramovich sparked a sharp sell-off. Mr Abramovich, who holds a stake of around 30pc in the mining company, was one of seven oligarchs whose UK assets have been frozen by the Government. Shares in FTSE 100-listed Evraz dropped 10pc before trading was stopped. Chelsea FC's shirt sponsor Three has said it's reviewing its relationship with the club after owner Roman Abramovich was targeted in new sanctions. The mobile network is likely to come under pressure to end its sponsorship deal as businesses cut ties with Russia over the country's invasion of Ukraine. Shortly after the sanctions were announced, Three said it would offer support to Ukrainian refugees arriving in the UK. The company will offer a free 30-day preloaded pay as you go SIM card to any incoming refugees from the conflict, including unlimited domestic calls, text and data for use within the UK. Russia has admitted China is refusing to supply airlines with parts, cutting off a key lifeline for the country's industry following western sanctions. Russian news agencies cited a top official as saying that Russia would look for opportunities to source parts from countries including Turkey and India after a failed attempt to obtain them from China. He also said Russian companies were registering their planes – many of which had been registered abroad – in Russia after the US and EU sanctions on aviation and that he expects some others to be returned to leasing companies. It comes after the Kremlin published draft laws showing it plans to block airlines from returning jets to foreign leasing companies and force them to pay leases in roubles. Shell is facing further financial hits from its decision to withdraw Russia over the country's invasion of Ukraine. The oil giant said it has $400,000 (£304,000) in Russian downstream assets. That's on top of the $3bn it has in other projects announced previously. Shell said last month it would pull out of its ventures in Russia with Gazprom and related entities including the flagship Sakhalin 2 liquefied natural gas plant and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project. This week it also said it's halting all purchases of Russian energy after it came under fire for buying a cargo of the Kremlin's crude at a discount last week, defying a wider trading boycott. Asian plane leasing giant BOC Aviation has said it has 18 jets trapped in Russia with a net book value of $935m (£710m). BOC, which is wholly owned by the Chinese state, said 4.8pc of its aircraft assets by net book value were leased to airlines in Russia as of the end of last month, adding they may be affected by sanctions against the country. The company said: “This is a complex and rapidly developing situation that we are monitoring closely. We will fully comply with all sanctions and other laws that are applicable to our business.” BOC added that insurers were cancelling elements of policies related to aircraft in Russia or leased to airlines there. The UK has shut Russia's aviation sector out of the London insurance market as part of a swathe of sanctions against Moscow. Uniqlo has decided to temporarily suspend operations in Russia after it faced a backlash over its decision to stay put. The brand's owner Fast Retailing came under fire after saying it would keep its stores in the country open, even as rivals including H&M and Zara pulled out. Tadashi Yanai, founder of Asia's largest retailer, insisted clothing was a necessity and that ""the people of Russia have the same right to live as we do."" But Uniqlo has now backtracked on its decision, citing operational challenges and the worsening of the conflict. The operator of Ukraine's gas pipelines has warned that Russian forces have seized more than one compressor station in the country, posing a potential threat to smooth gas transit to Europe. The operator (OGTSU) did not say how many stations were affected or where they were. It said: The OGTSU demands that the military and armed groups immediately leave the territory of the compressor stations and stop trying to influence the operation of the GTS [gas transmission system]. Interference in the technological processes of GTS operations creates significant risks for the safety of continuous gas transportation to consumers in Ukraine and Europe. Russian miner Evraz has slumped after its biggest shareholder Roman Abramovich was hit by UK sanctions. Mr Abramovich, who holds a stake of around 30pc in the company, was one of seven oligarchs targeted by new measures. Shares in Evraz dropped more than 12pc. It comes just a day after Evraz played down its links to Russia and said it hadn't granted any loans to the oligarch. The miner yesterday also scrapped its interim dividend, which would have returned cash to Mr Abramovich. The Government has ramped up its financial assault on Moscow by targeting a string of Russian oligarchs with new sanctions. Seven of Russia's wealthiest and most influential tycoons, whose collective net worth is estimated at $15bn, have been targeted in the fresh measures. Their assets in the UK will be frozen, they're banned from travelling here and no UK citizen or company may do business with them. They are: Roman Abramovich, owner of Chelsea FC, who has stakes in steel giant Evraz and Norilsk Nickel Oleg Deripaska, who holds stakes in EN+ Igor Sechin, chief executive of Rosneft Andrey Kostin, chairman of VTB bank Alexei Miller, chief executive of Gazprom Nikolai Tokarev, president of state-owned pipeline company Transneft Dmitri Lebedev, chairman of Bank Rossiya Britain has slapped sanctions on Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich as part of a fresh wave of measures targeting oligarchs. The billionaire is one of seven wealthy Russians whose assets have been frozen and will be banned from travelling to the country. Industrialist Oleg Deripaska – a former business partner of Mr Abramovich who holds a stake in miner EN+ – is also included on the list. Putin’s right-hand man Igor Sechin and four more of Putin’s inner circle are targeted. Their collective net worth is estimated at £15bn. The move means Mr Abramovich will be blocked from selling Chelsea. Last week he confirmed plans to offload the club, aiming for a price tag of around £3bn. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: There can be no safe havens for those who have supported Putin’s vicious assault on Ukraine. Today’s sanctions are the latest step in the UK’s unwavering support for the Ukrainian people. We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies. YouTube and the Google Play store are suspending all payment-based services in Russia, including subscriptions, in the latest challenge to the country's economy. Google and YouTube had recently stopped selling online advertising in Russia following similar pauses by Twitter and Snap after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. In a statement, YouTube said: ""As a follow-up, we're now extending this pause to all our monetisation features, including YouTube Premium, Channel Memberships, Super Chat and Merchandise, for viewers in Russia."" YouTube channels in Russia will still be able to generate revenue from viewers outside of Russia through ads and paid features, which include Super Chat and merchandise sales. Free apps on Google Play also remain available in Russia, according to a company support website. Natural gas prices dropped as much as 10pc this morning as Russia kept flows to the continent steady despite worries that Vladimir Putin could turn off the taps. Shipments via a key route crossing Ukraine are set to remain normal today, according to data from grid operator Eustream. Supplier Gazprom has also said flows via Ukraine are in line with client requests. That's reassuring markets amid concerns Moscow could cut gas supplies to Europe in retaliation against sanctions. Governments are preparing plans to wean themselves off Russian energy, but a halt in supplies would send prices even higher. Adding to the turmoil, Ukraine’s grid operator yesterday said Russian troops had entered two of four stations that pump gas to Europe. The FTSE 100 has lost ground in early trading, with sentiment dipping after yesterday's blistering rally. The blue-chip index fell 0.9pc, dragged down by losses for banking and mining stocks. Rio Tinto slumped to the bottom of the index, dropping more than 6pc in ex-dividend trading after it said it was cutting all ties with Russian businesses. HSBC lost ground, while BP and Shell both dropped after oil prices suffered their biggest one-day fall in three months amid volatile trading. The FTSE 250 dipped 0.2pc, with Wizz Air shedding 3pc. Credit Suisse has revealed it had 848m francs (£694m) of credit exposure to Russia at the end of last year, while it warned of higher provisions and lower deal-making as a result of the invasion. The Swiss lender said its exposure to Russia included derivatives and financing at the investment bank, trade finance at the Swiss business and lombard and other loans within private banking. But it said it had minimal exposure to sanctioned individuals within wealth management and that its Russia market risk exposure wasn’t significant. Credit Suisse is the latest European bank to reassure investors it can weather the conflict in Ukraine. The bank still has an office in Moscow and is viewed as a key player in managing expat Russian wealth. The lender said demand for trading and hedging was up, but this was offset by more fears of loans going bad – a similar dynamic to early in the pandemic. John Lewis is bringing back its staff bonus after the retailer's profits rebounded following a tough pandemic year. Employees at the high street stalwart will share a £46m pot, with each receiving a bonus of 3pc – or one-and-a-half week's pay. The company also said it will increase wages by 2pc on top of its pledge to pay the real living wage. It marks the return of payouts after John Lewis was forced to scrap last year's bonus for the first time since 1953. The group, which also owns Waitrose, reported underlying pre-tax profits of £181m in the year to January 29 thanks to record sales of £4.9bn – up 8pc on a like-for-like basis. It remained in the red on a bottom-line basis, though losses narrowed sharply to £26m from £517m in 2020, when the pandemic drove the company to its first ever annual loss. Chair Dame Sharon White hailed a ""good start"" to the group's five-year overhaul, but warned of a troubled wider outlook amid inflation and a cost-of-living crisis. John Lewis, which recently ditched its ""Never Knowingly Undersold"" pledge, has said it will remove any products made in Russia from its shelves. The FTSE 100 has lost ground at the open, bringing to an end a blistering rally that saw global markets surge on Wednesday. The blue-chip index fell 0.4pc to 7,159 points. The boss of Volkswagen has warned the economic damage from the war in Ukraine will be ""very much worse"" than the pandemic. Herbert Diess, chief executive of Europe's largest car maker, said the disruption to global supply chains from the conflict “could lead to huge price increases, scarcity of energy and inflation”. He told the Financial Times: “It could be very risky for the European and German economies.” Tough western sanctions against Moscow, combined with fears that Vladimir Putin could retaliate by cutting off supplies, have sparked chaos across energy and commodity markets. Economist fear this could fan inflation even higher across the continent, while also denting economic growth. Mr Diess added: For a society like Germany, depending on Russian energy, raw materials . . . if you imagine a scenario where we cut off business relations with Russia, which we probably would have to do if this conflict [does not end], you could not buy energy any more and this would lead to a situation that might impact Europe and Germany considerably. The rouble stabilised in early Moscow trading ahead of the first talks between Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers since the invasion began two weeks ago. The Russian currency was trading at 120.1 against the dollar – barely changed from yesterday's closing pric. Against the euro it was around 0.8pc weaker at 128. The rouble has tanked since Russia pushed troops into its neighbour, sparking a wave of tough sanctions by the West. It dropped to record lows yesterday when the Moscow market reopened after a trading suspension. Top Russian and Ukrainian diplomats Sergei Lavrov and Dmytro Kuleba are due to meet in Turkey later in the day, though Kyiv has said its expectations for the talks are low. Rio Tinto has become the first big mining company to cut ties with Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. The Anglo-Australian company, which previously said it had no assets or employees in Russia or Ukraine, said it was terminating all commercial relationships with Russian businesses. Rio Tinto runs the Queensland Alumina joint venture with Rusal, which holds a 20pc stake. It's not yet clear how the move will affect this partnership, but the firm said last week it had the “appropriate structures” in place to ensure operations would not be disrupted. Any decision to curb production at the site could add to the crunch in the aluminium market, where prices are already at historic highs. Rio is the latest in a string of companies to cut ties with Moscow. US giants McDonald's, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and Starbucks all said they were halted business in the country this week. Good morning. Russia may ban its airlines from returning leased aircraft to their owners in stubborn defiance against western sanctions. European leasing companies are facing a huge challenge to try and recover hundreds of jets after new measures against Vladimir Putin blocked them from doing business in the country. But the Kremlin has published draft laws that would prevent carriers from returning the planes. It would also force them to pay leases in roubles for the rest of the year. Russia's aviation industry has been brought to its knees by the sanctions, which also include wide-ranging airspace bans and exclusion from London's insurance market. 1) Fracking back on the table as Putin shakes foundations of UK energy policy Soaring gas prices prompt rethink among ministers keen to secure Britain's domestic supplies 2) Russian banks offer yuan accounts as Putin turns to China Plunging rouble and western sanctions prompt Russia to use Chinese currency 3) MoD signs off contracts worth billions on basis of just one bid £7.2bn worth of contracts were signed without a competitive process at all 4) Germany ‘fights efforts to block Sberbank’ Berlin faces accusations of pushing back on plans to block Russia from Swift international payments system 5) IMF approves $1.4bn in 'critical' support for Ukraine  Global lender warns of “already very serious” consequences of war as 2m refugees flee country Asian equities rallied on Thursday following a strong bounce on Wall Street and a breathtaking surge in Europe.

3/10/2022,"Remember the movie ‘The Perfect Storm’? Three weather fronts collided off the coast of New England, and George Clooney’s poor fishing boat never stood a chance. Hopefully, today’s economies will do better against the headwinds that are rapidly spinning into a perfect political-economic storm. The storm got started as 2022 opened up. The bull run we had last year came to sudden halt, markets started turning down, and by the end of January the NASDAQ was in correction territory with the S&P not far behind. Supply chain shocks and stubbornly high inflation were cast as the villains. Pundits started talking about the stagflation of the Carter years. Things failed to improve in February, as markets just couldn’t gain traction, and at the end of that month Russia invaded Ukraine, adding geopolitical tension, military conflict, and a looming wheat shortage to the mix. Now the specter of stagflation is closing in, a wicked combination of high inflation and low to no GDP growth. Ripple effects from Western financial sanctions on Russia are putting added pressure on global economies. Watching from Morgan Stanley, equity strategist Michael Wilson acknowledges the problem head-on, writing, “Downside risk remains most acute over the next 6-8 weeks. We are firmly in the grasp of a bear market that is incomplete in both time and price.” In this situation, investors will naturally gravitate toward defensive stocks – and that will quickly draw attention to the high-yield dividend payers. Dividend stocks offer a degree of safety by paying out an income stream whether markets move up or down, and that will help to insulate investors when the main indexes turn south. With this in mind, we used the TipRanks' database to pinpoint three stocks that meet a profile: a Strong Buy rating from Wall Street’s analysts and a dividend yield of 5% or better -- more than double the average dividend yield found among S&P-listed companies. Let’s take a closer look now. Alpine Income Property Trust (PINE) We’ll start with a commercial real estate investment trust (REIT), Alpine Income Property. Based at Daytona Beach, Florida, Alpine has a wide-ranging portfolio of properties, spread across most regions of the lower 48 states – the exception is the Rocky Mountain region. The company’s operations are focused on Texas, where it has 23 properties, with the 11 properties in Ohio coming in second. Overall, Alpine boasts 113 properties totaling 3.3 million square feet – and best yet, a 100% occupancy rate. The company has seen its revenues rise steadily over the past couple years, regardless of the pandemic, and the 4Q21 result, $9.47 million, was up 75% year-over-year. Diluted EPS in the quarter, at 64 cents, was orders magnitude higher than the 2 cents reported in 4Q20 – and simply blew away the 2-cent EPS forecast. These strong quarterly results gave Alpine confidence to keep up its dividend. The payment, declared for 27 cents per common share, is payable at the end of this month. Annualizing to $1.04, it gives a strong yield of 5.6%. Of importance to dividend investors, the company has raised the dividend payment 5 times in just the last two years. This commercial REIT is covered by BTIG analyst Michael Gorman, who wrote of it recently: “As a small-cap REIT early on in its growth cycle, Alpine has demonstrated its ability to generate value from smaller, one-off deals that are more insulated from private capital. Alpine grew FFO/sh 30% last year, and, despite the dilution from Office dispositions in 1H22, we expect the portfolio should again generate meaningful adjusted growth for shareholders this year."" ""While rising rates generally have an outsized impact on the net lease REIT sector's ability to grow, we expect investors could turn to well-levered value names such as PINE, which currently trades at a 21% relative discount despite outperforming the peer group by 2100 bps last year,"" the analyst added. To this end, Gorman rates PINE stock a Buy, while his $23 price target implies a 12-month upside potential of ~23%. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~28% potential total return profile. (to watch Gorman’s track record, click here) Wall Street, generally, likes this stock, as shown by the 4 to 1 breakdown of Buy versus Hold ratings, backing the Strong Buy consensus view. The stock is trading for $18.88 and its $22.20 average target indicates room for ~18% gain from that level in the year ahead. (See PINE stock analysis on TipRanks) Global Medical REIT (GMRE) The next stock we’re looking at, another REIT, specializes in medical properties and facilities. Global Medical has a portfolio comprising 167 buildings, with 298 leases. The bulk of the company’s operations are in the Midwest and Southeast regions, with 50 and 51 properties respectively. The total portfolio boasts over 4.3 million square feet of leasable space. In the last quarter of 2021, Global Medical brought in 6 cents per share in total earnings. While below the 7-cent forecast, this result was still triple the 2-cents from 4Q20. At the top line, revenue grew 21% year-over-year to reach $30.3 million. For the full year 2021, Global Medical made an important shift from net loss (of 17 cents per share in 2020) to a 19-cent EPS profit. The company has an 8-year history of keeping reliable dividends, and that has kept its payment steady at 20 cents per common share in the last two years, despite the pandemic crisis. The last declaration was in December, and paid out in January. The annualized payment of 80 cents per common share gives GMRE a solid dividend yield of 5.3%. Covering the stock for Colliers Securities, 5-star analyst Barry Oxford sees GMRE as a company in a sound position to keep bringing returns to shareholders. ""The company continues its strategy of investing in off-campus, purpose-built, medical facilities such as MOBs, specialty hospitals, IRFs and ASCs, that are geographically situated to take advantage of the aging U.S. population and the decentralization of healthcare. We believe their portfolio should continue to perform well in the short to medium term,"" Oxford explained. Furthermore, Oxford sees the current valuation as an attractive entry point, writing: ""The company has less than average multiple in the healthcare sector 15.3x versus 17.9x for the group. Given the company's conservative balance sheet, above average growth and excellent assets, we believe a premium multiple is warranted."" All of this prompted Oxford to maintain a Buy rating on GMRE, along with a $19 price target. This target conveys his confidence in GMRE's ability to climb 25% higher in the next year. (To watch Oxford’s track record, click here) Overall, the Strong Buy consensus rating on Global Medical is based on 6 recent reviews, that include 5 Buys over 1 Hold. The shares have an average price target of $18.30, implying an upside of ~22% from the current $15.08 share price. (See GMRE stock analysis on TipRanks) Medical Properties Trust (MPW) We’ll wrap up with another healthcare-focused REIT. Medical Properties has a $22 billion portfolio, with operations in 9 countries, and a total of 438 facilities with approximately 46,000 total beds. The largest part of the portfolio, some 72%, is general acute care hospitals. Behavioral health facilities make up 11% of the total, and inpatient rehab hospitals account for 9% of the company’s holdings. Medical Properties has seen its top line grow steadily in the past two years, with 8 consecutive sequential quarterly revenue gains. The most recent reported quarter, 4Q21, showed $409.3 million at the top line, up 22% year-over-year. At the bottom line, the company had an EPS of 34 cents, a 70% y/y increase. Long-term gains of this sort have allowed the company to fund a solid dividend, and Medical Properties boasts 9 consecutive years of dividend growth. The company has raised its dividend payment 4 times in the past two years along, with the most recent increase coming with the last declaration, in February. That declaration, for 29 cents per share, was up 1 cent from the previous 4 quarters, and with an annualized rate of $1.16, yields 5.7%. Looking at Medical Properties for Berenberg, analyst Connor Siversky is optimistic of the company’s prospects, writing: “While we believe the spiking cost of hospital labor at the end of 2021 will negatively affect coverage in the short term, it is our view that procedure costs will adjust quickly, negating a black sky scenario for a typical hospital operator. As such, we believe MPW presently represents a stable option for healthcare REIT investors in the short term. Relatively speaking, we find more visibility in the short-run financial condition of MPW versus peers in need of occupancy gains and margin expansion opportunities.” Accordingly, Siversky gives MPW a Buy rating alongside a $25 price target. The analyst, therefore, expects the stock to climb ~24% over the next 12 months. (To watch Siversky’s track record, click here) All in all, the 8 recent ratings on this stock add up to a Strong Buy consensus, with 6 positives outweighing the 2 Holds. Shares are trading for $20.13 and have an average target of $25.13, suggesting ~25% one-year upside potential.

3/10/2022,"(Bloomberg) — Investors’ inflation expectations suggest that U.S. yield-curve inversion is going to take them by surprise, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Most Read from Bloomberg China Warns U.S. Over Forming Pacific NATO, Backing Taiwan Owners Fear Planes ‘Are Gone Forever’ After Russia Shields Them From Seizure Biden to Sign Crypto Order as Firms Face Sanctions Pressure U.S. and U.K. Poised for Ban on Imports of Russian Oil Today China Pushes Conspiracy Theory About U.S. Labs in Ukraine The U.S. bond market has been dominated in recent months by sharp narrowing in the spread between short- and long-dated Treasury yields, fueled by expectations for Federal Reserve rate increases. The trend gathered pace in the two weeks since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine unleashed a surge in energy prices that threaten to boost inflation further. The gap between the two- and 10-year tenors breached 20 basis points Monday, down from over 90 basis points in early January. Curve flattening has raised the specter of an inversion — a historic signal from the bond market that a recession is likely in 12 to 18 months. The last inversion occurred in 2019 after a series of Fed rate hikes. The U.S. rates market is “pricing the inflation impact of an oil shock as temporary,” Goldman Sachs chief global rates strategist Praveen Korapaty said in a note Tuesday. If it continues to do so, “further upside shocks to inflation should manifest as even greater inversion of the inflation curve,” in which long-term inflation expectations are lower than short-term ones. The breakeven rate for 30-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, the market’s estimate for the average annual pace of consumer-price gains, climbed to 2.51% Tuesday, the highest level since 2013. But the five-year breakeven rate is 3.49%, the two-year 4.44%. It’s “a matter of arithmetic” that “an extremely inverted inflation curve makes inversions of the nominal yield curve that are either earlier in the cycle or deeper” than investors have been used to in recent decades, Korapaty writes.

3/10/2022,"The global economy is set to experience uncertainty, sky-high energy prices, and slowing growth as tough Russia sanctions put pressure on markets over the coming months, according to the global research team at Bank of America. In a Tuesday note to clients, the bank’s analysts warned that “there is no clear off-ramp for Russia” in the Ukraine conflict, and admitted that trying to pin down an exact economic forecast following Russia’s invasion has been like “catching a falling knife.” ""Expert opinion has been repeatedly wrong about the course of events. If we believe the experts, Putin would have never invaded, Ukraine would have offered weak resistance and sanctions would be limited,"" the analysts wrote. The team at BofA lowered their 2022 gross domestic product (GDP) forecasts for the U.S. from 3.6% to 3.3% over the past week, and they now see Euro Area GDP growth falling to just 2.8% this year, compared to 3.5% in previous estimates. The analysts also bumped their 2022 inflation expectations for the U.S. and Euro Area to 7% and 6%, respectively. However, strong savings rates, low unemployment, and energy independence will help the U.S. economy weather the storm better than most, the analysts predict. Still, they believe Americans should expect lower growth and higher inflation than was previously anticipated in a rough year ahead. The effect that Russian oil, or lack thereof, has on the global market should not be underestimated. Oil’s recent price jump to over $130 per barrel after the Ukraine invasion has shocked many market pundits and experts, including Bank of America. The bank’s global research team said they now see a scenario where Brent crude oil prices, the international benchmark, could rise to $175 per barrel by the second quarter. That means more pressure at the pump for average consumers around the world. Although previous U.S. and European sanctions against Russia were careful to leave oil untouched, that all changed today when President Biden announced a ban on Russian oil imports to the U.S. The president said the ban was part of actions meant “to continue to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine.” In a recent Quinnipiac University national poll, 71% of Americans said that they would support the move, even if it meant higher gasoline prices. In response to the ban, regular gas prices jumped to $4.17 in the U.S., a roughly 10 cent jump from Monday. Gas prices are now $1.39 higher than they were just a year ago, according to data from the American Automobile Association. The European Union also revealed on Tuesday that it would cut Russian gas imports by two-thirds this year, even as Dutch TTF gas futures jumped as much as 25% on Monday, showing Europe’s resolve to stand by their sanctions. Unlike the U.S., which imports just 3.2% of its gas from Russia, Europe bought around 150 billion cubic meters of Russian gas last year—representing about one-third of its needs, according to B of A.The tough sanctions from both US and Europe will lead to higher oil and gas prices and have darkened the inflation outlook, according to Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi, who said in a Tweet on Tuesday that expectations for price increases are threatening “to become unhinged.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",World/Fortune•2 days ago,"BofA says ‘There is no clear off-ramp’ for Russia and ‘it’s like catching a falling knife,’ issues dire prediction for global economy",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bofa-says-no-clear-off-174726740.html
3/10/2022,"The stock market is all about themes and right now, given Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and all that has followed in its wake, the times will shine a spotlight on Cybersecurity stocks. It’s almost taken for granted that as the US and its allies ramp up sanctions and measures intended to shun and isolate Russia, Putin will respond by cyber warfare. Government organizations and corporations are obviously acutely aware of this and will therefore be spending large amounts of money to secure networks and troves of data. And that will provide an enormous tailwind for Cybersecurity stocks. Surveying the cybersecurity landscape, JMP analyst Trevor Walsh has pinpointed 3 such names that are set to benefit from the current macro developments, and which the analyst thinks are poised to push significantly higher over the coming months. Using the TipRanks database we can also get an idea what the rest of the Street has in mind for these names. It appears all are Buy-rated and projected to yield considerable returns in the year ahead. Let’s look behind the curtain. OKTA (OKTA) The first cybersecurity stock we're looking at, Okta, is a leading player in the identity and access management space. Nowadays, enterprises view security and identity management as a major priority. It’s a market that is worth around $80 billion annually, and Okta could claim a serious chunk of this figure. By securing and connecting business workflows which in turn results in more effective operating metrics, Okta’s offerings help companies accelerate their digital transformation. And more and more companies are moving operations to the cloud with the digital transformation trend acting as a real tailwind. As such, OKTA is seeing meaningful growth. Additionally, an aggressive sales and marketing approach and significant acquisitions have also helped power the expanding topline. This was evident in the identity-for-the-cloud specialist’s latest quarterly report - for 4Q21. Boosted by the March 2021 acquisition of Auth0, revenue reached $383 million, a 63% year-over-year increase and coming in some way above the Street’s $359.6 million estimate. While adj. EPS of -$0.18 beat the Street’s call by $0.06, the loss widened from the same period a year ago and the current climate is unforgiving for growth stocks posting losses. Going by Okta’s outlook, it will probably continue to do so for the foreseeable future. As the company expects ploughs ahead with more growth, in the upcoming fiscal year (FY23), it expects non-GAAP losses of around $185 million, widening the losses of $68 million posted last year. That said, JMP’s Trevor Walsh thinks Okta has what it takes to keep on expanding the customer base. He writes, “Okta’s Identity Cloud serves as a flexible and reliable platform from which to tackle a variety of sub-segments within the broader Identity and Access space. While there are many niche players tackling specific identity-related security challenges in the market today, we believe security and developer teams will look to consolidate these use cases under a single identity and access platform provider. As Okta continues to expand its offering through organic and inorganic growth, we believe it will be well-positioned as the identity solution of choice for many organizations.” To this end, Walsh rates OKTA an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $260 price target. Should the figure be met, investors are looking at 12-months returns of ~53%. (To watch Walsh’s track record, click here) Overall, Okta has plenty of Street support; of the 24 analyst reviews on record, 5 stay on the sidelines but all 19 others are positive, resulting in a Strong Buy consensus rating. Going by the $233.71 average price target, the shares are anticipated to appreciate ~37% over the coming months. (See OKTA stock forecast on TipRanks) SentinelOne (S) Next up, SentinelOne, is a cybersecurity firm with a difference. There are many companies focused on stopping cyberattacks, but SentinelOne's USP is that its platform is driven entirely by artificial intelligence (AI), making it completely autonomous and doing away with the need for any human intervention. This gives SentinelOne an edge; as attacks have gotten increasingly sophisticated, it can stamp them out as they happen. The platform’s simplicity and the all-round protection provided has made SentinelOne a favorite amongst businesses. The customer count increased to more than 6,000 by the end of 3Q21 (October) from April’s 4,700 client list. The company counts big players such as Samsung, Estee Lauder, Hitachi and Electronic Arts as customers. This popularity is reflected in an expansion of the top-line. In the most recent quarterly report, for F3Q22, revenue increased by 128.1% year-over-year to reach $56.02 million, in turn beating the Street’s call by $6.44 million. There was a beat on the bottom-line too, as adj. EPS of -$0.15 came in $0.03 above the consensus estimate. Given the continued growth, the $139.2 million of revenue accrued in the fiscal year’s first 3 quarters already eclipses the 93.1 million generated over the entire previous year. The company sees that trend continuing; SentinelOne predicts more triple-digit growth in Q4 and anticipates bringing in more than $199 million for the full year. Walsh lists several reasons to get behind this company. These include, “1) a unique endpoint security architecture emphasizing an AI-driven approach which sustains marked differentiation in a competitive, established market; 2) potential for international footprint expansion; 3) demonstrated TAM extensibility via inorganic contributions and technology tuck-ins; 4) an open architecture for optimized customizability across XDR (extended detection and response) use cases, leveraging the broadest range of integrations and inter-operability with best-of-breed security providers; 5) an accelerating top-line story post public debut still in hyper-growth mode; and 6) a sticky land/expand subscription model.” Based on these reasons, Walsh rates S shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) and his $65 price target suggests room for ~88% share appreciation in the year ahead. Most on the Street are onboard too; the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 7 Buys vs. 3 Holds. The analysts see plenty of room for growth here; the $55 average target implies ~59% upside for the next 12 months. (See SentinelOne stock forecast on TipRanks) Zscaler (ZS) By 2025, Cybersecurity Ventures estimates cybercrime will result in losses of $10.5 trillion a year, far above 2015’s $3 trillion hit. It is cloud-based cybersecurity security specialists such as Zscaler that help companies counter this increasingly costly threat. The company boasts a cloud-native platform, the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange, which facilitates companies’ secure move from a network infrastructure to the cloud. And Zcaler has scale on its side, as it is the largest security cloud; every day, the platform scans more than 200 billion web transactions, pinpointing and preventing over 150 million attacks a day with the use of AI. With each client added to the platform, its overall security is enhanced, leading to a network effect, with every new client benefitting the platform’s other users. The platform has consistently garnered accolades too, for several years being recognized by Gartner as a best-in-class offering. Meanwhile, Zscaler has exhibited consistent growth, on display again in the latest earnings report – for F2Q22 Revenue increased by 62.8% from the same period a year ago to reach $255.56 million, ahead of consensus by $13.69 million. There was a beat on the bottom-line too as adj. EPS of $0.13 came in $0.02 above the Street’s call. However, anything less than pristine reporting on all fronts won’t cut the mustard in the current unforgiving stock market climate and the stock sold off due to weaker than anticipated guidance. However, Walsh highlights the company’s “best-of-breed capabilities” and thinks investors should take note of the company due to several reasons: ""1) a novel and highly efficient approach to solutions within the network security domain, which continues to be one of the foundational components to an organization’s cybersecurity technology stack; 2) rise of Zero Trust frameworks as a critical strategy within cybersecurity for which Zscaler’s Zero Trust Exchange was designed specifically to address; and 3) an experienced management team led by visionary founder, CEO Jay Chaudhry, who brings decades of leadership and security industry experience having founded four companies prior to Zscaler.” Unsurprisingly, Walsh rates ZS stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy) and his $350 price target shows room for ~65% growth over the one-year timeframe. Looking at the consensus breakdown, Zscaler’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 18 Buys, 5 Holds and 1 Sell. Shares are expected to change hands for ~47% premium a year from now, given the average price target currently stands at $311.17.
