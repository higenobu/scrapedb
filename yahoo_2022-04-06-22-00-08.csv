4/6/2022,"Russian cosmonauts sparked speculation after they wore yellow-and-blue spacesuits last month. They later said they wore those colors to represent their university, not to symbolize the Ukrainian flag. NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei said Tuesday they were ""blindsided"" by the attention they received. The Russian cosmonauts who wore yellow and blue — the colors of Ukraine's flag — to the International Space Station were ""blindsided"" by speculation that they were protesting the war, NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei said Tuesday. Vande Hei landed in Kazakhstan last week after spending 355 days in space. In his first press conference since his return, Vande Hei described what life was like with his Russian colleagues on the ISS as Russia's invasion of Ukraine unfolded. He specifically addressed the speculation surrounding the Russian cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev, and Sergey Korsakov after they were photographed wearing yellow-and-blue spacesuits upon their arrival on the ISS on March 18. Yellow and blue are the colors of the Ukrainian flag, which many have been using to show support for the nation as it defends itself from Russia. ""All three of them happened to be associated with the same university, and I think they were kind of blindsided by it,"" Vande Hei said of his Russian crewmates, CNN reported. Artemyev, Matveev, and Korsakov were graduates of Bauman Moscow State Technical University, which has a blue and gold coat of arms. Vande Hei said the Russians ""had no idea that people would perceive that as having to do with Ukraine,"" The Washington Post reported. After photos of Artemyev, Matveev, and Korsakov wearing blue and yellow were published, multiple former NASA astronauts, including Scott Kelly and Terry Virts, speculated on social media that the Russians were showing support for Ukraine. But Artemyev shut down the speculation on the Russian space agency's Telegram channel several days later, saying: ""There is no need to look for any hidden signs or symbols in our uniform,"" the Associated Press reported. ""A color is simply a color. It is not in any way connected to Ukraine. Otherwise, we would have to recognize its rights to the yellow sun in the blue sky,"" he said. ""These days, even though we are in space, we are together with our president and our people!"" During the press conference, Vande Hei declined to comment on how his Russian crew members felt about the invasion of Ukraine. ""Those are things that I would prefer that they get to share directly rather than me sharing how they feel about it,"" he said, CNN reported. He added that their discussions about the war were ""very brief"" because their main focus ""was on our mission together."" Vande Hei's interview came several days after Russia's space agency chief, Dimitry Rogozin, announced that Russia was suspending its cooperation on the ISS and its partnership with NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency. The US, European Union, and Canada have all sanctioned Russia over the invasion. Tensions between Russian and US space agencies have been on the rise after Rogozin criticized the US sanctions in aggressive social-media posts and argued on Twitter with the former US astronaut Mark Kelly. But Vande Hei said that the camaraderie in space remained the same. ""They were, are, and will continue to be very dear friends of mine,"" he said of his Russian colleagues, per CNN. ""We supported each other throughout everything. And I never had any concerns about my ability to continue to work with them.""

4/6/2022,"NEW YORK (AP) — A man who bragged about ruining the career of an ex-New York City police commissioner who once seemed destined for a national post was a con man who coerced his daughter’s college friends into obeying his commands and supplying him with millions of dollars, a prosecutor told a jury Monday. Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary Bracewell urged Manhattan federal court jurors during a closing argument to convict Lawrence Ray of charges including racketeering, conspiracy, forced labor, sex trafficking and obstruction of justice. “Bring Lawrence Ray to justice,” she said as the defendant scribbled notes while lawyers summarized a month of evidence. Ray’s lawyer, Marne Lenox, countered that Ray was a victim of the young people he lived with who made him feel paranoid and under attack. “Everyone was out to get him, Larry believed,” Lenox said, portraying his daughter's friends as “storytellers” who he believed had intentionally poisoned him. Closings were to continue Tuesday in an unusual trial t hat featured testimony from several of the men and women who lived with Ray for much of the last decade before his arrest in early 2020 disrupted what Bracewell characterized as the operations of a crime syndicate she labeled the “Ray Family."" The trial was twice interrupted so Ray, 62, could be taken to the hospital for treatment of medical issues that Judge Lewis J. Liman assured jurors was unrelated to the coronavirus. In her closing, Lenox said Ray in the fall of 2010 impressed friends of his daughter at her on-campus dormitory at Sarah Lawrence College with his claims that he'd spoiled the rise of former New York City police Commissioner Bernard Kerik after serving as best man at his wedding. She said he told them that people including Kerik were out to get him. Kerik was the city's police commissioner from 2000 to 2001, serving during the 9/11 attacks, and he nearly became President George Bush’s homeland security secretary in 2004, but his name was abruptly withdrawn as the nominee. Shortly afterward, the Daily News reported that Ray, who was under indictment in a stock scam, had produced evidence that Kerik failed to report thousands of dollars in gifts he’d received while working for the city. Kerik eventually served nearly four years in prison for tax fraud and other crimes. Bracewell said Ray initially won respect from the students with his stories of influence as he moved into his daughter's dormitory, but he quickly turned their trust against them by convincing them that they had poisoned him and owed him millions of dollars in compensation. Then, she said, he used violence and threats and terrified them into following his commands. “Every single one of his actions was designed ... to keep control over them,” Bracewell said, urging jurors to reject defense claims that Ray acted as he did because he believed they had poisoned him and he wanted to build a criminal case. “Why on earth would you share meals with your supposed poisoners?” she asked. The prosecutor  cited the testimony of one woman who said she paid Ray $2.5 million from her proceeds as a prostitute, an endeavor she said he steered her into after she became convinced she had poisoned him. Bracewell also directed jurors to recall the testimony of a student who was about to begin work as a doctor when she became romantically involved with Ray, leaving her sidetracked for the next decade. The prosecutor said Ray was able to carry out his crimes with help from his daughter and Isabella Pollok, a woman who has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges. Her trial is set for later this year.",U.S./Associated Press,"Prosecutor: Con man plied daughter's friends for sex, cash",https://news.yahoo.com/prosecutor-con-man-plied-daughters-221548919.html
4/6/2022,"RODANTHE, N.C. (AP) — A bridge that will allow locals and tourists to avoid a perennially washed-out route on North Carolina’s Outer Banks is set to open to traffic this month. People will be able to walk, bike and run across the 2.4-mile (3.8-kilometer) Rodanthe Bridge on Saturday ahead of its opening, The News & Observer reports. The $154 million bridge will take North Carolina Highway 12 over Pamlico Sound, bypassing the south end of the Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge and part of the road that’s often washed over by the ocean during storms. Construction on the project — known as the “jug handle bridge” because of how it sticks out over the water — started in 2018. A group of property owners and residents sued in federal court to try to stop the bridge from being built, arguing the environmental impacts weren’t thoroughly weighed and a popular wind-surfing spot would be affected. The Defenders of Wildlife and the National Wildlife Refuge Association, however, sided with the North Carolina Department of Transportation. While the bridge took nearly 3 acres (1.2 hectares) from the refuge, about 19 acres (7.7 hectares) will be restored where part of the existing highway will be removed. Environmental groups actually pushed for a longer bridge, but the transportation department said it would be too expensive. Two bridges were built instead. The $252 million, 2.8-mile (4.5-kilometer) Marc Basnight Bridge over Oregon Inlet opened in February 2019. Saturday’s “community day” at the Rodanthe Bridge will include 5-mile (8-kilometer) and 5K (3-mile) races. Part of the bridge will be opened to walkers and cyclists from 1 p.m.-5 p.m.",U.S./Associated Press,Outer Banks will soon open 2nd bridge to skirt flooded route,https://news.yahoo.com/outer-banks-soon-open-2nd-201508312.html
4/6/2022,"DeLorean, the automaker behind the pop culture icon gull-winged car, provided a fresh teaser image and a debut date of an all-electric vehicle concept that aims to breathe new life into the brand. The upcoming EV concept is the latest effort of Stephen Wynne, who owns the DeLorean name and supplies parts for the 6,000 or so remaining vehicles, to revive the brand. Wynne partnered with several Texas executives who more recently were connected to Karma Automotive. DeLorean Motors Company CEO Joost de Vries formerly worked at Karma. The teaser image shows a three-quarter shot of the vehicle, specifically the left shoulder and back tail light of the concept car. Not much more is known, but if DeLorean follows the path of virtually every other automaker, we can expect many more teasers to come. https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js In a Linkedin Post, de Vries wrote ""Yes, a teaser as it doesn't show the whole vehicle yet, but a great shot of the rear quarter ! Looking forward to share more soon…."" The new EV concept, which was first announced in a social media campaign before Super Bowl LVI, will debut during Monterey Car Week in August, the company said Monday. Along with the reveal, DeLorean will also announce the official name of the vehicle. The DeLorean EV concept will be displayed August 21 on the concept lawn at Pebble Beach during Monterey Car Week. The company said in its announcement that the ""past, present, and future of DeLorean will unfold over the duration of Monterey Car Week through a series of activations and events showcasing the vehicle."" Concept is the important word here, which means its future as a vehicle that consumers can buy and drive is not clear. It could, as so many concept cars before it, end up in the figurative trash bin. Bringing the vehicle to production will take capital — and lots of it.

4/6/2022,"NEW YORK (AP) — Shares in a company planning to buy Donald Trump's new social media business plunged Monday on a news report that two key staff members left, deepening losses from last week when it said it would miss a deadline to file its annual financial statements. Digital World Acquisition Corp. closed Monday down 10% following a Reuters report that the chief technology officer and chief products officer had left the company, citing two anonymous sources. Neither executive responded to requests for comment by The Associated Press, but a person close to the company speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk confirmed the two had left. It was not immediately clear why the head of technology, Josh Adams, and the product chief, Billy Boozer, decided to leave, but the staff turnover comes at a bad time for the company as it struggles to attract subscribers. The departures follow a filing by the company last week stating that its accountants needed more time to review financial figures before filing its annual report. Many public companies request filing extensions, but the news added to investor jitters fueled by the botched February launch of Trump's Truth Social app, which was marred by outages and long wait lists to gain access. As of Monday, nearly 1.5 million potential subscribers were waiting for access. The stock rocketed past $100 last fall after Digital World announced it planned to buy Trump's company, Trump Media & Technology Group, the developer of the Truth Social app. Shares in Digital World ended Monday at $56.94, down more than a third over the past month. Last week, Trump's two adult sons began posting on the platform. “Feels the whole gang is back together!” Eric Trump wrote. The same day, Don Jr. posted, “Who's ready for some truth!” But the biggest attraction for Truth Social, the ex-president, hasn't posted anything after writing more than month and half ago, “Get Ready. Your favorite president will see you soon!” The Truth Social app topped Apple’s App Store free rankings on the day it was made available to a limited set of subscribers in February. Since then, it has tumbled down the charts and is no longer in the top 200. Another possible problem for Digital World is funding its operations. Trump managed last year to get dozens of investors to agree to put $1 billion into the business once Digital World combines with Trump Media, but that hasn't happened yet. Digital World is still waiting for regulators to sign off on the deal, which is no sure thing. The company said last year that the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating  Digital World  following reports it may have broken security rules last year. Digital World is a so-called blank check company, a empty entity set up with the sole purpose of buying an operating business that is allowed to offer stock to raise money without much public disclosure because it doesn't have a clear idea what it will buy yet. News reports last year said Digital World and Trump’s company had conversations about a merging before Digital World stock began trading, in possible violation of the rules. The company has said it its complying with the probe. Trump has dismissed the regulatory scrutiny as a politically motivated “witch hunt.” Despite the Digital World stock plunge Monday, the price still values the company at more than $2 billion, surprisingly high for a business with virtually no operating history or publicly available financial figures.",Business/Associated Press,Stock tied to Trump social firm drops on report of turmoil,https://news.yahoo.com/stock-tied-trump-social-firm-164913173.html
