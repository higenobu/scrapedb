4/14/2022,"An Alaskan guide was filming a survival video in Juneau, Alaska, for her 170,000 TikTok followers when she suddenly heard a landslide heading toward her. Buy, sell or hold? How to decide what to do with a plummeting stock The woman, who goes by the Dirty Explorer (@thedirtyexplorer) on TikTok, stopped filming her video and looked up, terrified, when she heard a landslide approaching. She quickly picked up her phone and kept recording as she ran as fast as she could away from her filming spot. See this Manhattan apartment get an unbelievable maximalist makeover with just $1,000: At one point, according to the text overlay, she thinks the landslide is either stopping or slowing down, but viewers can hear the sudden increase in sound that indicates the main slide is just beginning. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, sounds like a faint rumbling or trees cracking indicate an approaching landslide. It’s advised that if you think a landslide is coming, you should leave your location — even without your belongings — and run out of its path. If that’s not possible, try to protect your head. Halfway through the TikTok, @thedirtyexplorer waved her arms and yelled “Stop!” to a nearby truck on the road. “Stop!” she screamed. “Stop your car!” She explained in the text overlay that the truck was about to encounter a blind turn while traveling at 50 miles per hour that would’ve put it right in the landslide danger zone. “Literally, 30 seconds and [I would] get f***ing killed,” the truck driver told @thedirtyexplorer. “Can we think about that?” “I ran screaming down the road, just so you know, on the beach flailing my arms,” she responded. Commenters were amazed by @thedirtyexplorer’s quick thinking and reaction. “Impeccable decision making,” one said. “This is what survival instinct looks like,” another agreed. “Great job.” “The adrenaline must have been REAL,” someone wrote. “So glad you quickly recognized what was going on and acted.” In a follow-up video, @thedirtyexplorer showed the aftermath of the landslide and wrote, “If you think you ran far enough, no you didn’t.” She also took the opportunity to make a point about man-made climate change continuing to impact people every day. A study analyzing the High Mountain Asia region of China, Tibet and Nepal found a link between more frequent and intense rainfalls — a result of climate change — could cause more landslides in the area. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency confirmed in 2021 that climate change can affect the intensity and frequency of precipitation. There has also been a significant increase in “heavy precipitation” — instances where rainfall or snowfall exceeds what is normal for the area — since the 1980s.

Mako Komuro, who married her college boyfriend and moved to New York City last fall, is now reportedly assisting curators at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Because the law in Japan requires a princess to ""leave the imperial family upon marriage to a commoner,"" Princess Mako gave up her royal titles to marry Komuro. She also turned down a $1.3 million payout from the Japanese government that is traditionally paid to royal women who lose their royal status when they marry. According to the Japan Times, Mako is serving as an unpaid volunteer at the Met. The 30-year old is working within the museum's Asian art collection and has specifically been involved in preparing an exhibition of paintings inspired by the life of a 13th-century monk who traveled throughout Japan as he introduced Buddhism.

4/14/2022,"University of Pennsylvania law professor Amy Wax has sparked online outrage again for her comments about Asian immigrants.

Wax, whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Eastern Europe, criticized immigrants who criticize the U.S. during an interview with conservative political commentator Tucker Carlson on his Fox News show “Tucker Carlson Today” on April 8.

The 69-year-old professor stated that “Blacks” and “non-Western” groups have “a tremendous amount of resentment and shame against Western peoples for [their] outsized achievements and contributions” before specifically calling out Brahmin Indian immigrants.

4/14/2022,"By Pavel Polityuk and Oleksandr Kozhukhar KYIV/LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) -Russia said it had taken control of the port in Mariupol on Wednesday and that more than 1,000 Ukrainian marines had surrendered in the southeastern Ukrainian city, whose capture would free up forces for a wider offensive. The capture of the Azovstal industrial district, where the marines have been holed up, would give the Russians full control of Mariupol, Ukraine's main Sea of Azov port, reinforce a southern land corridor and expand its occupation of the country's east. Surrounded and bombarded by Russian troops for weeks and the focus of some of the heaviest fighting in the war, Mariupol would be the first major city to fall since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Russia's defence ministry said 162 officers were among 1,026 soldiers of the 36th Marine Brigade who had surrendered to Russian and pro-Russian separatist forces near the Illich Iron and Steel Works. Russian television showed pictures of what it said were marines giving themselves up, many of them wounded. The defence ministry later said Mariupol's trade seaport was under full control and remnants of Ukrainian forces were blocked and unable to escape, Interfax news agency reported. Ukraine's general staff said Russian forces were attacking Azovstal and the port, but a defence ministry spokesman said he had no information about any surrender. Reuters journalists accompanying Russian-backed separatists saw flames billowing from the Azovstal area on Tuesday, a day after Ukraine's 36th Marine Brigade said its troops had run out of ammunition. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, an ardent supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin, urged remaining Ukrainians trapped in Azovstal to surrender. ""Within Azovstal at the moment there are about 200 wounded who cannot receive any medical assistance,"" Kadyrov said in a Telegram post. ""For them and all the rest it would be better to end this pointless resistance and go home to their families."" WEAPONS APPEAL Tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol and Russia has been massing thousands of troops in the area for a new assault, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. ""We have destroyed more Russian weapons and military equipment than some armies in Europe currently possess. But this is not enough,"" he said in an online video, adding that if Ukraine did not get more tanks, jets, and missile systems, other countries in Europe would be the next targets of Russia. U.S. President Joe Biden announced an extra $800 million in military assistance including artillery systems, armoured personnel carriers and helicopters, taking the total to more than $2.5 billion. France and Germany also pledged more arms. Ukraine accuses Russia of blocking aid convoys to civilians marooned in Mariupol. Its mayor, Vadym Boichenko, said Russia had brought in mobile crematoria ""to get rid of evidence of war crimes"" - a statement that was not possible to verify. Moscow has blamed Ukraine for civilian deaths and accused Kyiv of denigrating Russian armed forces. Moscow's incursion into Ukraine has seen more than 4.6 million people flee abroad, killed or wounded thousands and left Russia increasingly isolated on the world stage. In the village of Lubianka northwest of Kyiv, from where Russian forces had tried and failed to subdue the capital before being driven away, a message to Ukrainians had been written on the wall of a house that had been occupied by Russian troops. ""We did not want this ... forgive us,"" it said. The Kremlin says it launched a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""liberate"" Ukraine, a message villagers said had been repeated to them by the Russian troops. ""To liberate us from what? We're peaceful...We're Ukrainians,"" Lubianka resident Viktor Shaposhnikov said. FOUR PRESIDENTS IN KYIV Polish President Andrzej Duda said on a visit to Kyiv with his Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian counterparts that those who had committed and ordered crimes must be brought to justice. ""This is not war, this is terrorism,"" he told reporters. Germany's president did not join them as he had planned. Zelenskiy said there had been no official approach and one of his officials denied a newspaper report he had rejected the visit due to Steinmeier's recent good relations with Moscow. The Kremlin denounced Biden's description of Moscow's actions in Ukraine as amounting to genocide, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying this was unacceptable coming from the leader of a country he said had committed crimes of its own. An initial report by a mission of experts set up by Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe documents a ""catalogue of inhumanity"" by Russian troops in Ukraine, according to the U.S. ambassador to the OSCE. ""This includes evidence of direct targeting of civilians, attacks on medical facilities, rape, executions, looting and forced deportation of civilians to Russia,"" Michael Carpenter said. Russia has denied targeting civilians and has said Ukrainian and Western allegations of war crimes are fabricated. The Kyiv district police chief said 720 bodies had been found in the region around the capital from where Russian forces had retreated, with more than 200 people missing. International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan said after visiting Bucha, a town where bound bodies of people apparently shot at close range were found, that Ukraine was a ""crime scene"" and this was within ICC jurisdiction. ""We have to pierce the fog of war to get to the truth,” Khan said on Twitter. The major of the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest, said bombing had increased significantly on Wednesday and satellite photos from Maxar technology showed long columns of armoured vehicles in the region. At least seven people were killed, including a two-year-old boy, and 22 wounded in Kharkiv over the past 24 hours and Ukrainian forces shot down two Russian planes attacking towns in the region, regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said earlier. Reuters could not immediately verify his statement, but filmed people in Kharkiv quietly carrying bodies from an apartment block hit by shelling. A woman sat sobbing by the body of her son, lying on the floor in the room she said she had implored him to leave before a second explosion killed him.

4/14/2022,"Racist. Anti-Semitic. Unhinged. The suspect in Tuesday’s shooting on the New York City subway is a prolific user of social media, regularly uploading lengthy, often racist diatribes to both YouTube and Facebook in which he addresses a range of topics from the state of race relations in the United States to the policies of New York City Mayor Eric Adams, according to videos reviewed by Rolling Stone. More from Rolling Stone Frank R. James, Suspect in NYC Subway Shooting, Arrested A Person of Interest Has Been Identified in Brooklyn Subway Shooting 'Darkness Enveloped My Soul': The Final Confessions of the Torso Killer After being named a person-of-interest Tuesday evening, Adams said Frank R. James, 62, was now considered a suspect in the shooting, which took place in Brooklyn during morning rush hour aboard a Manhattan-bound N train between 59th and 36th streets around 8:30 a.m. Adams gave a series of interviews Wednesday morning, April 13, during which he said he was confident James would be arrested soon. He also offered an update on four people who were injured during the attack, saying they were still hospitalized. “We’re going to catch this person, and we’re going to bring him to justice and hold him responsible for this horrific act,” Adams said on CNN (via The New York Times). One of the photos of James released by NYPD was taken from a recently uploaded YouTube video titled “STOP ONE COMPLETE,” which was posted to a channel called “prophet oftruth88.” A Facebook page under the name “profitofdoom008” contains videos similar to those posted to the “prophet oftruth88” YouTube channel, some of which feature an individual sporting identical clothing worn in the YouTube videos, and also includes a playlist titled “PROPHETOFTRUTH88.” On Wednesday, YouTube wiped James’ channel, saying it was “terminated for violating YouTube’s Community Guidelines.” (A rep for YouTube did not immediately return Rolling Stone‘s request for comment.) Although the man in videos uploaded to both the YouTube and Facebook accounts never identifies himself by name, he bears a strong resemblance to photos of James distributed by authorities. In a news conference Tuesday, NYPD commissioner Keechant Sewell stated Mayor Adams’ security detail has been bolstered “in light of the videos,” the New York Times reported — thus indirectly confirming the link between James and the disturbing social media posts. In his videos — which number in the hundreds and feature titles such as “why we need more racial profiling,” “should the black woman be forcibly sterilized,” and “TO KILL OR NOT TO KILL” — James often rails against numerous racial and ethnic groups, including whites, Blacks, Jews, and Latinos. He also compares people of color to “a bunch of turds in a toilet,” waiting to be “flushed” down the drain by society, and implies that a race war between whites and Blacks is imminent. In one video, he calls Sept. 11, 2001 “the most beautiful day in the history of this country.” “White people and Black people should not have any contact with each other,” he says in a March 23 video titled “born in an insane asylum.” “Their anger is building up. Nothing can happen here differently than what happened over in Europe with the Jews. I want you to believe that that’s possible.”  In a March 2 video named “TOLD YOU SO,” James uses a news segment on recent subway attacks as a segue into an attack on Mayor Adams’ policies against crime and homelessness, seemingly implying that his struggles are a direct result of the failures of New York City social services. “These are the people that was supposed to be helping me. They made me worse,” he says, gesturing to a computer screen opened to a photo file named “THEM HOSE,” which appears to display headshots of employees of New Jersey’s Bridgeway Behavioral Health Services — an organization James references in numerous videos. “They made me fucking worse. They made me more dangerous than I could ever — than anything, anyone could ever fucking imagine. These are the people that Eric Adams wants to send out to help the homeless and whatever the case may be. It ain’t gonna happen.” James then goes on to describe the individuals as Adams’ “calvary,” before launching into a homophobic and anti-Semitic screed against the South Bronx Mental Health Council and Albert Einstein College of Medicine. “A bunch of fucking predators. A bunch of deviants. A bunch of psychopath and sociopathic fucking bitches,” he says. “They’re going to help you, Eric.” In the same video, James mocks the mayor’s subway safety plan rolled out earlier this year, going so far as to suggest he could easily commit a crime in a subway station without being caught. “He can’t stop no fucking crime in no subways. He may slow it down, but he ain’t stopping shit,” he laughs, adding that the large number of entry and exit points from subway stations would make apprehending criminals nearly impossible. “With this program in place, with all these police — I’d still get off. I know I could get off because they can’t be everywhere… Those who go on to commit crimes, like shooting? That means you have to have police in every station, and that’s not possible.” Among the many topics James tackles in his rambling, slur-laden videos is his belief that Black Americans have allowed themselves to be “Europeanized” by whites. He occasionally flip flops between admiration and hatred for other Black Americans, often espousing Black nationalist ideals and calling for the creation of a Black ethnostate before immediately disparaging educated Blacks and prominent Black women such as Vice President Kamala Harris and newly confirmed Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. “If they tried to exterminate us, I would not be mad for one fucking bit,” he says of white people. “They can’t live with each other, but they’re going to live with your Black ass? Your half-monkey, cursed by God, Black fuckin’ stinkin’ ass?” One of James’ most egregiously racist videos is “they hate jew” — a convoluted, semi-autobiographical tirade uploaded to Facebook in late 2017 that finds him fantasizing about killing a Latino man whom he claims prevented him from advancing his machining career, and suggesting that Jewish individuals “have so much contempt for Blacks,” despite undergoing the horrors of the Holocaust. “These Jews obviously haven’t learned shit from their experience. You know, it hasn’t humbled them in the slightest,” he says. “They’re all — or the majority of them — still arrogant and still feel they’re superior and something above Black people. And, again, those motherfuckers don’t contribute to shit to life on this earth but shit, piss, pollution, and death and destruction.” James’ consistent use of the same usernames results in an online footprint that leads to several more YouTube accounts — one of which, WFJFURADIO, contains content that the uploader states dates back to as early as 2002. Another account containing videos over a decade old features a man wearing the exact same shirt worn by James in the “born in an insane asylum” clip from just one month ago. How James managed to slip under the radar for so long, despite repeatedly making violent threats and spreading hate speech through some of the most heavily moderated social media platforms, remains a mystery. Yet, as of early Wednesday morning, James still has not been identified as the prime suspect in the subway shooting. However, his final rage-filled upload, an April 11 clip called “DOMESTICATED AVERAGES,” serves as an eerie precursor to Tuesday’s violence, revealing the mindset of a mentally anguished hatemonger at his breaking point.  “I’ve been through a lot of shit, where I can say I wanted to kill people. I wanted to watch people die right in front of my fucking face immediately,” he says. “But, I thought about the fact that, ‘Hey man, I don’t wanna go to no fucking prison.’ Fuck that…So, I had to absorb the bullshit. Even though it was building up inside me, what could I do? Not much.” Updated at 9:08 a.m. ET on 4/13/22 to reflect that Frank R. James is now considered a suspect, and not just a person of interest, in the NYC subway shooting. Updated at 12:32 p.m. ET on 4/13/22 after YouTube deleted James’ channel.

4/14/2022,"China's development of advanced anti-ship weapons has renewed debate on aircraft carriers' future. US officials say carriers aren't invulnerable but are well defended and won't be easy to attack. Anyone thinking they're ""little teacups out there or something"" is wrong, Capt. Paul Campagna said. In March 1922, the US Navy's first aircraft carrier, the USS Langley, entered service. A century later, some are questioning whether carriers can survive in the wars of the future. The development of increasingly sophisticated anti-ship weapons by capable adversaries, namely Russia and China, has raised doubts about those ships. The captains of two of those carriers discounted the concern, saying the US Navy's 11 flattops would be tough to find and hard to stop. Questions about whether carriers are ""obsolete"" have come up before, including when Congress was debating whether to build the USS Enterprise, the Navy's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, in the late 1950s, Capt. Paul Campagna, the commanding officer of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, said. ""I think the aircraft carrier has shown itself to be very enduring. For anyone that's worried about the modern threat that's out there, I'll just say that the carrier is not on an island,"" Campagna said on April 5 at the Sea Air Space conference in National Harbor, Maryland. ""It deploys with the air wing. It deploys with the strike group. It deploys with a layered defense that goes from the bottom of the ocean and out to space, and anyone who thinks that we're fragile, little teacups out there or something like that is grossly mistaken,"" Campagna added. The doubts about the carrier's future are driven in large part by China's military modernization, which has produced a variety of long-range weapons and more capable aircraft, ships, and submarines to launch them. China's anti-ship missiles are the major concern, especially the DF-21D and DF-26B ballistic missiles, which are designed for naval targets and sometimes called ""carrier killers."" The DF-21D was introduced in the mid-2000s, and the DF-26 was first seen in public in 2015. They have long been considered threats to US ships and bases. China has built targets shaped like US aircraft carriers and destroyers, and hawkish Chinese officials have advocated using those missiles against the real things. In August 2020, the Chinese military fired a DF-21D and a DF-26B into the South China Sea, in what was seen as a demonstration of its ability to deny access to the sea where Beijing has made sweeping but widely rejected territorial claims. In an interview that December, Adm. Philip Davidson, then the head of US Indo-Pacific Command, confirmed the missiles were fired at ""a moving target"" and said US officials had ""known for years"" that China was pursuing that capability. In written testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee in March 2021, Davidson said ""mid-range, anti-ship ballistic missiles"" — specifically the DF-21 — ""are capable of attacking aircraft carriers in the Western Pacific."" The use of the missiles in a large-scale exercise was meant to demonstrate the Chinese military's ""focus on countering any potential third-party intervention during a regional crisis,"" Davidson wrote at the time. China also has air- and sea-launched anti-ship cruise missiles that, when fired from new warships, submarines, and long-range bombers, can reach deep into the Pacific. China and Russia are both developing hypersonic weapons that could use speed and maneuverability to evade missile defenses and strike a carrier thousands of miles from shore. The Chinese are ""pouring a lot of money in the ability to basically rim their coast in the South China Sea with anti-ship-missile capability,"" Vice Adm. Jeffrey Trussler, the director of naval intelligence, said in February 2021, adding: ""It's a destabilizing effort in the South China Sea, the East China Sea — all of those areas."" Current and former US Navy officials acknowledge that carriers are not invulnerable, but they stress that the ships are well defended and resilient and need to accept some risk to be effective. ""With the compartmentalization that we have, with our ability to man repair lockers throughout the ship — which are basically fire stations inside the ship — and our ability to seal it up and to absorb any kind of kinetic impact with 1,000 feet of steel, it's designed to take it. We're ready to go. We're lethal,"" Campagna said. The Navy conducted ""shock trials"" on its newest carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, in summer 2021, detonating 40,000-pound explosive charges in the water around it. The Ford was the first carrier to go through shock trials since 1987. The trials didn't simulate a direct hit, but Navy officials said the ship needed only a fraction of the repairs as the last carrier to go through them. The trials were a demonstration of ""super resilience"" against conventional anti-ship weapons, a Chinese commentator said in August. US carriers are ""incredibly well built, as you saw with the shock trials on Ford,"" Campagna said. ""These things will take it and continue to operate, so I'm very confident in the aircraft carrier, very confident taking it out to sea in any environment."" The layered defenses Campagna referred to include anti-ballistic-missile systems aboard the ships of the carrier strike group. The US Missile Defense Agency is also pursuing seaborne defenses for hypersonic threats. The carrier itself has sensors and defenses, including surface-to-air missiles, radar-guided cannons, and ""soft-kill"" measures like decoys and electronic jamming. Chinese and Russian submarines are also a growing concern, and the US and allied navies have reemphasized anti-submarine warfare. The risks of long-range missiles are forcing planners to reconsider combat operations to keep carriers and other ships out of range of those missiles until US bombers, submarines, and long-range missiles can knock them out. The US Navy is also pursuing longer-range aircraft and weaponry to continue operating in such a scenario. The MQ-25 carrier-based refueling drone, which will extend the range of carrier aircraft, was recently tested aboard a carrier for the first time. Hitting US carriers also requires Chinese forces to find and track them. Carriers can move while a missile is in flight, which means the missile needs to be able to locate them or receive updated guidance. Flying at thousands of miles an hour also produces friction that can affect the missile's accuracy and be spotted by radar. The effectiveness of anti-ship ballistic missiles ""hinges on a comprehensive reconnaissance and targeting architecture,"" which ""remains a work in progress"" for China, Andrew Erickson, a professor at the US Naval War College's China Maritime Studies Institute, said in a November 2020 interview. Missile-guidance systems have existed for decades, and China could overcome deficiencies in its own guidance systems by firing more missiles at a specific area. Campagna and his counterparts emphasized that their carriers wouldn't wait for those missiles to arrive. ""Moving around at 30 knots, you can cover a lot of sea space and make it very challenging,"" Campagna said. The carrier's speed and maneuverability mean ""figuring out who actually is where is not a small thing,"" Capt. Paul Lanzilotta, the Ford's commanding officer, said. ""We're fast, we're maneuverable, and we will use all of those things to our advantage,"" Lanzilotta said.

4/14/2022,"(Reuters) -Ukraine's security services on Tuesday said they had arrested pro-Russian politician Viktor Medvedchuk, who is President Vladimir Putin's closest and most influential ally in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had earlier published a photo of a tired-looking and handcuffed Medvedchuk, who says Putin is godfather to his daughter. In February, Kyiv said Medvedchuk, the leader of the Opposition Platform - For Life party, had escaped from house arrest. Last year authorities opened a treason case against Medvedchuk, who denies wrongdoing. ""You can be a pro-Russian politician and work for the aggressor state for years. You may have been hiding from justice lately. You can even wear a Ukrainian military uniform for camouflage,"" the security services said in an online post. ""But will it help you escape punishment? Not at all! Shackles are waiting for you and same goes for traitors to Ukraine like you."" The post cited Ivan Bakanov, head of the secret services, as saying his operatives had ""conducted a lightning-fast and dangerous multi-level special operation"" to arrest Medvedchuk but did not give details. Last month Zelenskiy said the Opposition Platform - For Life, which is Ukraine's largest opposition movement, and several other smaller political parties with ties to Russia had been suspended. A spokesperson for Medvedchuk was not immediately available for comment.

4/14/2022,"Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro got into a heated exchange with a student about gender identity while speaking at a North Carolina college. Shapiro was speaking at an event titled “Men Cannot Be Women,” which was hosted by the Young Americans Foundation (YAF), at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG) on Monday when the incident occurred. The author and media host was taking questions from the audience when he got into an exchange with a student who introduced himself as a “mathematician and physicist.” “So, I think I’m pretty qualified to say that most of what you’re saying is based on old data,” the student said in the video. “Like, for example, gender identity disorder. That’s a DSM4 [diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders] bro. We use a DSM5 now.” “I literally cited the DSM5 in the speech, and it’s called gender dysphoria,” Shapiro said. DSM5 is a resource used by health care professionals in the U.S. to classify and diagnose mental disorders, according to the American Psychiatric Association. The student then said, “You sound like a bozo, bro,” and took shots at his relationship with his wife. “Let me just say, the nice thing about having several small children is I don’t feel the necessity of having my masculinity challenged by someone like you,” Shapiro responded. The student then pointed out that Shapiro was drawing his ideas from a “Western colonial framework of gender” and noted that other cultures, like some Native American and African communities, have a different viewpoint of how gender should be interpreted. “And they are incorrect. I am saying biologically, they are incorrect,” Shapiro said. The Hill has reached out to Shapiro and UNCG. Shapiro has been a very vocal opponent of LGBTQ arguments about gender identity, claiming that men and women cannot alter the gender they were assigned at birth, and that gender is a binary. The exchange comes amid a push by GOP lawmakers across the country to advance bills that restrict the rights of transgender young people, including measures to ban trans girls from youth sports and block access to medical care required for transitioning.

4/14/2022,"PARIS (AP) — French far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen warned Wednesday against sending any more weapons to Ukraine, and called for a rapprochement between NATO and Russia once Moscow’s war in Ukraine winds down. Le Pen, an outspoken nationalist who has long ties to Russia, also confirmed that if she unseats President Emmanuel Macron in France’s April 24 presidential runoff, she will pull France out of NATO’s military command and dial back French support for the whole European Union. Macron, a pro-EU centrist, is facing a harder-than-expected fight to stay in power, in part because the economic impact of the war is hitting poor households the hardest. France’s European partners are worried that a possible Le Pen presidency could undermine Western unity as the U.S. and Europe seek to support Ukraine and end Russia’s ruinous war on its neighbor. Asked about military aid to Ukraine, Le Pen said she would continue defense and intelligence support. “(But) I’m more reserved about direct arms deliveries. Why? Because ... the line is thin between aid and becoming a co-belligerent,” the far-right leader said, citing concerns about an “escalation of this conflict that could bring a whole number of countries into a military commitment.” Earlier Wednesday, French government spokesman Gabriel Attal said France had sent 100 million euros ($109 million) worth of weapons to Ukraine in recent weeks as part of a flow of Western arms. Earlier in his term, Macron had tried to reach out to Russian President Vladimir Putin to improve Russia’s relations with the West, and Macron met with Putin weeks before the Russian invasion in an unsuccessful effort to prevent it. Since then, however, France has supported EU sanctions against Moscow and has offered sustained support to Ukraine. Le Pen also said France should strike a more independent path from the U.S.-led NATO military alliance. And despite the atrocities that Russian troops have committed in Ukraine, Le Pen said that NATO should seek a “strategic rapprochement” with Russia once the war is over. Such a relationship would be “in the interest of France and Europe and I think even of the United States,” she said, to stop Russia from forging a stronger alliance with world power China. She did not directly address the horrors unfolding in Ukraine. Le Pen was speaking at a press conference Wednesday to lay out her foreign policy plans, which include halting aid to African countries unless they take back “undesirable” migrants seeking entry to France. She also wants to slash support for international efforts to improve women’s reproductive health in poor countries, increase minority rights or solve environmental problems. At the end of the event, protesters held up a poster showing a 2017 meeting between Le Pen and Putin. One activist was pulled out of the room. Anti-racism protesters also held a small demonstration outside. “The election of Madame Le Pen would mean electing an admirer of Putin’s regime, an autocratic regime and an admirer of Putin’s imperialistic logic,” said Dominique Sopo, head of the group SOS Racism. “It would mean that France would become a vassal to Putin’s Russia.” ___ Follow all AP stories related to France's 2022 presidential election at https://apnews.com/hub/ french-election-2022. ___ Follow all AP stories on Russia's war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.",World/Associated Press,France's Le Pen warns against sending weapons to Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/frances-le-pen-warns-against-170452890.html

Insider identified KK as Katie K. Leonard, founder and managing partner of The Leonard Firm in Atlanta, Georgia. Leonard did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. In her video, she adds the disclaimer that there are ""outliers,"" and not all men in these professions fall into the trend. But in general, she noticed that men in these professions tend to be more ""narcissistic"" and ""controlling."" ""They tend to be far more difficult in dealing with a divorce. They have kind of a 'nuke the earth, you know, scorch the earth, how dare you challenge me' kind of approach to litigation,"" she continued. ""If you look at these professions, what do they all have in common?"" she said. ""They're gods in their profession, right?"" ""If you're a policeman, you're walking around with a gun.

And then you come home, and all of a sudden, somebody's asking you to take out the trash. I think that that's a difficult kind of transition to make,"" she said. Meanwhile, pilots, including those who work in the military, have a lot of responsibility as they are ""in control of like 150, 200 people's lives at a time,"" she said. ""And they tend to be very narcissistic and very controlling."" KK's TikTok has generated more than 1.5 million views and 12,400 comments, with many agreeing with her assessment.

4/14/2022,"Last year, the monstrous Bernardinelli-Bernstein comet (also known as C/2014 UN271) was discovered by the eponymous University of Pennsylvania astronomers Gary Bernstein and Pedro Bernardinelli. The pair called it the “nearly spherical cow of comets” in their paper about the discovery, but it wasn’t long until the world dubbed it the “megacomet” for being an absolute unit of a space object. While the megacomet fell out of the main space news spotlight, NASA astronomers set the the Hubble Space Telescope’s sights on the object in the months since—and discovered how truly immense it is. A new paper published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters on Tuesday confirmed that Bernardinelli-Bernstein had a nucleus—the icy core at the center of all comets—that’s more than 80 miles wide. That’s roughly 50 times larger than other comets and the largest ever observed. “This comet is literally the tip of the iceberg for many thousands of comets that are too faint to see in the more distant parts of the solar system,” David Jewitt, a professor of planetary science and astronomy at the UCLA and co-author of the study, said in a NASA press release. “We've always suspected this comet had to be big because it is so bright at such a large distance. Now we confirm it is.” Even with the imagery provided by the Hubble, scientists still had their work cut out for them in sussing out its precise size. After all, the megacomet is still incredibly far away. So the team had to process images taken of the comet by the Hubble in a computer model, which gave them an approximate estimation of its mass. Now astronomers can confirm that the Bernardinelli-Bernstein comet is much larger than any other comet ever discovered. The previous record was held by C/2002 VQ94, which had a nucleus that’s a mere 60 miles across. A size comparison of the Benardinelli-Bernstein comet's nucleus to other notable comets. Disconcertingly, the megacomet is on an interstellar road trip that’ll bring it right through our solar system in 2031. Luckily for us, it’s not expected to get any closer than a billion miles away from the sun, passing between Saturn and Uranus’ respective orbits. This won’t be the first time it’s made such a trip either since most comets observed originated from the collision of space rocks that created Earth long ago. In fact, the megacomet is following a 3-million-year-long elliptical orbit—so it’s been a minute since we’ve seen it last. Its next approach in nine years will provide astronomers with a very rare opportunity to closely study an object that might still contain remnants from the early solar system. With the mighty James Webb Space Telescope unfurled and in orbit, there’s a chance we could get an even more in-depth look at the comet than we ever have before. “It’s pristine,” Bernardinelli told The Daily Beast last year. “Not a lot has happened to this object since its formation in the early days of the solar system, and so we can think of it as a window into the past.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

4/14/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Western weaponry pouring into Ukraine helped blunt Russia's initial offensive and seems certain to play a central role in the approaching, potentially decisive, battle for Ukraine's contested Donbas region. Yet the Russian military is making little headway halting what has become a historic arms express. The U.S. numbers alone are mounting: more than 12,000 weapons designed to defeat armored vehicles, some 1,400 shoulder-fired Stinger missiles to shoot down aircraft and more than 50 million rounds of ammunition, among many other things. Dozens of other nations are adding to the totals. The Biden administration is preparing yet another, more diverse, package of military support possibly totaling $750 million to be announced in the coming days, a senior U.S. defense official said Tuesday. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss plans not yet publicly announced. The additional aid is a sign that the administration intends to continue expanding its support for Ukraine's war effort. These armaments have helped an under-gunned Ukrainian military defy predictions that it would be quickly overrun by Russia. They explain in part why Russian President Vladimir Putin’s army gave up, at least for now, its attempt to capture Kyiv, the capital, and has narrowed its focus to battling for eastern and southern Ukraine. U.S. officials and analysts offer numerous explanations for why the Russians have had so little success interdicting Western arms moving overland from neighboring countries, including Poland. Among the likely reasons: Russia's failure to win full control of Ukraine's skies has limited its use of air power. Also, the Russians have struggled to deliver weapons and supplies to their own troops in Ukraine. Some say Moscow's problem begins at home. “The short answer to the question is that they are an epically incompetent army badly led from the very top,” said James Stavridis, a retired U.S. Navy admiral who was the top NATO commander in Europe from 2009 to 2013. The Russians also face practical obstacles. Robert G. Bell, a longtime NATO official and now a professor at the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs at Georgia Tech University, said the shipments lend themselves to being hidden or disguised in ways that can make them elusive to the Russians — “short of having a network of espionage on the scene” to pinpoint the convoys' movements. “It’s not as easy to stop this assistance flow as it might seem,” said Stephen Biddle, a professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University. “Things like ammunition and shoulder-fired missiles can be transported in trucks that look just like any other commercial truck. And the trucks carrying the munitions the Russians want to interdict are just a small part of a much larger flow of goods and commerce moving around in Poland and Ukraine and across the border. “So the Russians have to find the needle in this very big haystack to destroy the weapons and ammo they’re after and not waste scarce munitions on trucks full of printer paper or baby diapers or who knows what.” Even with this Western assistance it's uncertain whether Ukraine will ultimately prevail against a bigger Russian force. The Biden administration has drawn the line at committing U.S. troops to the fight. It has opted instead to orchestrate international condemnation and economic sanctions, provide intelligence information, bolster NATO's eastern flank to deter a wider war with Russia and donate weapons. In mid-March, a Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said arms shipments would be targeted. “We warned the United States that pumping weapons into Ukraine from a number of countries as it has orchestrated isn’t just a dangerous move but an action that turns the respective convoys into legitimate targets,” he said in televised remarks. But thus far the Russians appear not to have put a high priority on arms interdiction, perhaps because their air force is leery of flying into Ukraine's air defenses to search out and attack supply convoys on the move. They have struck fixed sites like arms depots and fuel storage locations, but to limited effect. On Monday, the Russians said they destroyed four S-300 surface-to-air missile launchers that had been given to Ukraine by an unspecified European country. Slovakia, a NATO member that shares a border with Ukraine, donated just such a system last week but denied it had been destroyed. On Tuesday, the Russian Ministry of Defense said long-range missiles were used to hit two Ukrainian ammo depots. As the fighting intensifies in the Donbas and perhaps along the coastal corridor to the Russian-annexed Crimean Peninsula, Putin may feel compelled to strike harder at the arms pipeline, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called vital to his nation's survival. In the meantime, a staggering volume and range of war materiel is arriving almost daily. “The scope and speed of our support to meeting Ukraine’s defense needs are unprecedented in modern times,"" said John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary. He said the approximately $2.5 billion in weapons and other material that has been offered to Ukraine since the beginning of the Biden administration is equivalent to more than half of Ukraine's normal defense budget. One example: The Pentagon says it has provided more than 5,000 Javelin missiles, which are among the world's most effective weapons against tanks and other armored vehicles — and can even take down a low-flying helicopter. The missile, shaped like a clunky dumb bell and weighing 50 pounds (23 kilograms), is fired by an individual soldier; from its launch tube it flies up at a steep angle and descends directly onto its target in what its known as a curveball shot — hitting the top of a tank where its armor is weakest. The Pentagon said Wednesday that an unspecified number of additional Javelins are to be delivered by Thursday, and the U.S. will complete the delivery of 100 armed Switchblade “kamikaze” drones this week. The specific routes used to move the U.S. and other Western materials into Ukraine are secret for security reasons, but the basic process is not. Just this week, two U.S. military cargo planes arrived in Eastern Europe with items ranging from machine guns and small arms ammunition to body armor and grenades, the Pentagon said. A similar load is due later this week to complete delivery of $800 million in assistance approved by President Joe Biden just one month ago. The weapons and equipment are offloaded, moved onto trucks and driven into Ukraine by Ukrainian soldiers for delivery. Kirby said the material sometimes reaches troops in the field within 48 hours of entering Ukraine.",World/Associated Press,Russia has yet to slow a Western arms express into Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-yet-slow-western-arms-041203366.html
4/14/2022,"An elderly woman in Washington who was accused of a hate crime against her Vietnamese neighbor last year has agreed to sell her home to pay the victim $45,000.

Jan Myers, 72, was charged with a hate crime on Thursday for harassing her neighbor Thi Pham in April 2021.

Pham’s lawyers announced that Myers has agreed to a civil settlement dictating that she must attempt to sell her home in Shoreline, Washington, and pay Pham $45,000 from the home's sale.
 
 Hate crime in Shoreline:

- She was released from jail shortly after & family says the harassment has continued
- ⚠️You hear her saying slurs like “slant eye” & “you’re not going to live very long” pic.twitter.com/TUZ8GcYeqz 
— Deedee Sun (@DeedeeKIRO7) August 18, 2021 


Pham and her husband Bill Healy’s lawyers filed a lawsuit against Myers in August 2021 after they said she had been repeatedly harassing and threatening their family, with some incidents even captured on video.

Pham said Myers started harassing them when she was working in her garden in April last year. Myers reportedly made threats and was caught on video referring to Pham as “slant eye.” Pham started recording the incident using her phone, catching Myers yelling, “Hey Miss Vietnam... you're not going to live very long.”

Healy, who called the incident “devastating,” said Myers had also exposed herself to his wife and their 2-year-old son, which was also caught on camera. As the family filed their lawsuit, Pham said she no longer felt safe in their home.

The family’s lawyers called the civil settlement a victory for victims of racial harassment.

“We need to make the people who are harassing people because of their race pay and make them pay the victim,” said lawyer Jeffery Campiche.

Under the settlement, Myers has agreed to sell her home in the next six months and pay Pham $45,000 from the sale.

Should Myers fail to sell the home and move as agreed, Pham’s lawsuit against Myers will proceed to trial and potentially be decided by a jury.

“I am happy that I can safely live in my home without racial harassment,” Pham was quoted as saying by KGW. “We hope Jan Myers follow [sic] through the agreement and move quickly.”

While the civil settlement has been agreed to, Myers may still face criminal charges for her threatening behavior, for which a trial is tentatively set to begin on June 8. Enjoy this content?

4/14/2022,"By Mark Trevelyan and Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen LONDON (Reuters) - Russia can afford to wage a long war in Ukraine despite being hammered by Western sanctions aimed at crippling its ability to sustain the campaign, defence experts and economists say. Russia's invasion has driven up the price of the oil, gas and grain it exports, providing it with a substantial windfall to fund its ""special military operation"" - now entering a new phase as Moscow focuses on the eastern Donbas region after failing to break Ukraine's defence of the capital Kyiv. As the war grinds on, rising casualties and the need to rotate fresh troops into battle may prove more pressing challenges than the financial cost. ""This type of low-tech war can be financed almost entirely in roubles, which means they can continue pouring troops and heavy artillery into Ukraine at least until there's a more general collapse of the economy,"" said Jacob Kirkegaard, economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. Johan Norberg, senior analyst at the Swedish Defence Research Agency, said: ""The sanctions will not affect this war in the short run, because Russia's military is fighting with tanks it had already built and soldiers it had already trained."" Sanctions are expected to shrink the economy by more than 11% this year, the World Bank says, but revenues from energy exports are actually increasing. The Russian finance ministry said on April 5 that Moscow expects to earn $9.6 billion in additional revenue from energy sales in April alone thanks to high oil prices, which remain around $100 a barrel. There is no doubt, however, that Russia's vaunted military machine has taken a huge and costly hit. The United States assesses that Russia has lost about 15-20% of its combat power during its invasion of Ukraine, a senior U.S. defence official said. That includes everything from tanks, armoured vehicles, artillery systems, fighter and bomber aircraft and helicopters to surface-to-air and ballistic missiles, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. LOST TANKS According to Oryx, a closely watched military blog which tallies both sides' losses based on verifiable visual evidence, Russia had lost at least 2,770 items of military equipment as of Tuesday, including at least 476 tanks that had been destroyed, damaged, abandoned or captured. That, said Yohann Michel of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), is more than the combined tank strength of NATO members France (222) and Britain (227). Russia, which had around 3,000 tanks before the war, according to IISS figures, is not about to run out. But experts said some of those are likely to be old, in poor condition or held for spare parts, so the effective number available for combat is lower. Mathieu Boulegue, a specialist in the Russian military at Chatham House, said Moscow had so far held back its most modern weaponry, which it is reluctant to lose, and relied heavily on an abundance of more expendable Soviet-era hardware. He said it could take ""a decade or two at least"" to rebuild equipment levels to where they were before the war - a task complicated by a host of factors including design and innovation challenges, corruption, the indebted state of defence companies and a lack of access to Western microelectronics because of sanctions. DEFENCE BURDEN Russian military spending will need to rise both because of the war with Ukraine and the resulting sharp increase in tension with NATO, which has sent thousands more troops to eastern Europe, said Richard Connolly, an associate fellow at RUSI in London and director of the Eastern Advisory Group consultancy. He said defence spending as a share of GDP could rise significantly from its current level of around 4%, potentially doubling in the next few years. Connolly said ordinary Russians would feel the impact but the state could comfortably pay for the war effort, even if its economy is plunged into recession. If necessary it could commandeer resources like fuel from state-owned companies. The more pressing question, he said, was the level of casualties and the difficulty of sustaining a war involving up to 150,000 troops at a time. Russia has so far acknowledged only 1,351 troops killed and 3,825 wounded, although Ukraine and Western governments believe the toll is many times higher. Its army and airborne troops have a combined strength of about 325,000. Eventually, Connolly said, it may have to take the politically unpopular decision to dip into its reserves, which the IISS estimates to number 2 million men under 50 with military service within the past five years. ""If you’ve got 150,000 committed to Ukraine, you’ve got half of your effective army currently in combat operations, many of which have experienced significant losses,"" Connolly said. ""So they’re going to need to replace, they’re going to need to rotate them. They're using their entire army, basically - or they will be if this goes on for very much longer.""

The death of the dolphin on Quintana Beach led to a reminder from the Texas Marine Mammal Stranding Network not to interfere with stranded dolphins. The non-profit group said the dolphin was stranded alive on Sunday, April 10, and beach goers pushed it back to sea. Some of them reportedly swam with and rode the sick animal. “She ultimately stranded and was further harassed by a crowd of people on the beach, where she later died before rescuers could arrive on scene,” the group said. Those who harass wild dolphins are subjected to fines of up to $11,000 and jail time of a year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. “We encourage you to observe them from a distance of at least 50 yards,” NOAA said. NOAA announced in July 2021 that Texas Parks and Wildlife officials, as well as its own personnel, would increase patrolling of North Padre Island due to the harassment of a dolphin. That dolphin, NOAA said, was the victim of people swimming with, riding, jumping on and petting. When people interact with dolphins, McClatchy News reported at the time, the animals become comfortable and are more likely to approach things it associates with humans, such as boats. This could lead dolphins to being hit by boats or getting stuck in fishing equipment. “We view this as a human behavior problem,” TMMSN said last year, McClatchy News reported. “We know if people change their behavior, the dolphin’s behavior will also change, and we can prevent future injuries to people and the dolphin.” If you see a stranded dolphin, the Texas Marine Mammal Stranding Network encourages you to call 1-800-962-6625 for guidance on what to do before authorities arrive. To report harassment of marine mammals, contact NOAA’s Fisheries’ Enforcement hotline at 1-800-853-1964. People keep riding friendly dolphin in Texas.

4/14/2022,"(Reuters) - Russia on Wednesday told Ukraine to ""watch out"" after its former Soviet neighbour captured pro-Kremlin politician Viktor Medvedchuk, turning down Kyiv's offer of a swap with a warning that those holding him might soon be detained themselves. Medvedchuk, one of President Vladimir Putin's close allies in Ukraine, was shown handcuffed and wearing the uniform of a Ukrainian soldier on Tuesday in a picture tweeted by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy proposed swapping Medvedchuk, while Ukraine's SBU domestic security service cast him as a traitor whose future would be in shackles. ""Those freaks who call themselves the Ukrainian authorities say that they want to beat testimony out of Viktor Medvedchuk, 'quickly and fairly', convict him, and then exchange him for prisoners,"" Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said. ""These people should watch out and lock the doors well at night to make sure they do not become the people who are going to be exchanged themselves,"" said Medvedev, a close Putin ally who served as Russian president from 2008 to 2012. In February, Ukraine said Medvedchuk, leader of the Opposition Platform - For Life party, escaped from house arrest. Authorities last year opened a treason case against Medvedchuk, who denies wrongdoing. The Kremlin said the court case against Medvedchuk was politically motivated and denied that he had any communication back channel to the Russian leadership. ""He had no backstage relationship with Russia,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday. ""We will follow the fate of Viktor Medvedchuk - and we also call on European politicians to do the same as they are always so concerned about freedom of speech,"" Peskov said. Ukraine's SBU warned all ""pro-Russian traitors and agents of the Russian secret services"" that they would be brought to justice ""for all the crimes of the present day"". Thousands of people in Ukraine have been killed and nearly 10 million displaced after Russia sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, raising fears of a wider confrontation between the United States and Russia - the world's two biggest nuclear powers. Putin says what he calls the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Moscow had to act to defend Russian-speaking people in Ukraine against persecution. Ukraine says it is fighting against an imperial-style land grab and dismisses Putin's claims of genocide as nonsense. Asked about the Ukrainian proposal to swap Medvedchuk for Ukrainians being held by Russia, Peskov said Medvedchuk was a Ukrainian citizen and a foreign politician.

4/14/2022,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott followed through on his cruel promise to dump asylum seekers and migrants in the capital with the first busload conveniently arriving outside Fox News’ office on Wednesday morning. Abbott vowed last week to bus them to the Capitol steps in response to the Biden administration’s decision to end Title 42, a pandemic-era emergency order implemented by Donald Trump that allowed migrants to be sent back to Mexico at the border, even if they were seeking asylum. “To help local officials whose communities are being overwhelmed by hordes of illegal immigrants who are being dropped off by the Biden administration, Texas is providing charter buses to send these illegal immigrants who have been dropped off by the Biden administration to Washington D.C.,” he said. Texas Governor @GregAbbott_TX carries out his pledge to transport illegal migrants to Washington, DC. The bus pulled up right in front of the building that houses @FoxNews , @NBCNews and ⁦@cspan⁩ pic.twitter.com/KsrP04LSuw — John Roberts (@johnrobertsFox) April 13, 2022 “We are sending them to the United States Capitol where the Biden administration will be able to more immediately address the needs of the people that they are allowing to come across our border.” Around 30 people got off the bus when it pulled up at about 9 a.m. in front of the Hall of the States building, which houses Fox News, MSNBC and C-SPAN, a few blocks away from the Capitol. Fox News reported that officials cut off their wristbands and told them they were free to go. Eleven migrants who spoke to The Daily Beast at Union Station said they wouldn’t be staying in the D.C. area. Instead, the group was planning to split up as Catholic Charities help them travel to New York City and Miami. Alexande Alberto, Alejandro Rivero, and Ledinyek Rico—all from Venezuela—said they were dropped off in D.C. without any resources. “Gentlemen of the church are good people,” Rivero told The Beast. “We are without resources, and we want to achieve.” Father John Enzler of Catholic Charities told The Daily Beast that another two buses are expected to arrive from Texas—one later Wednesday and one on Thursday morning. “Its not well organized,” he said. Enzler added that his organization’s facilities—totaling 34 sites in D.C.—are mostly full but will look to “transition” migrants. “Everybody [will] go somewhere else,” Ivan Calderon, an immigrant from Colombia, told The Daily Beast in comments translated by a Univision reporter. “It was crowded,” he added when asked about the conditions on the bus. The voyage took “approximately 4 or 5 days,” Calderon noted. Those that spoke with The Daily Beast said they had come from Colombia, Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Cuba. Multiple advocacy groups had decried Abbott’s stunt as callous, pointless and possibly illegal as states can’t enforce federal immigration law. “There is no one to help them,” a volunteer with the Catholic charity lamented to The Daily Beast, adding that the bus was sent by the Texas governor just to dump the migrants off at the Hall of the States building with no assistance.

4/14/2022,"It's one of the main drivers of U.S. inflation reaching a 40-year high, and among the factors most likely to hurt Democrats’ electoral chances in the November midterms. It’s high gasoline prices, and President Joe Biden is starting to get creative in trying to lower them. U.S. gas prices currently average $4.27 per gallon, a sharp decline after a mid-March high that caused drivers to put in fewer miles on the road, sending demand for gas plummeting. But the national average is still well over $1 more per gallon relative to a year ago, and the current decline by no means indicates that prices won’t rise again. As summer nears, and demand for gas inevitably grows, a limited gas supply could lead to prices exceeding $5. One U.S. diplomat even warned that an inability to import more gas could cause prices to rise as high as $6 this year, something that has already happened in some parts of the country Biden is desperate to reduce prices, and he announced his latest measure to do so on Tuesday. Speaking from a bioprocessing and ethanol manufacturing plant in Menlo, Iowa, Biden announced that he would make gasoline blended with ethanol available year-round instead of suspending its sale during summers. Ethanol blended fuel is slightly more affordable, and Biden hopes the plan will bring prices down significantly at the pump, but the President will likely encounter resistance as ethanol fuel has for years drawn the ire of environmental and energy groups, to the point that the Environmental Protection Agency had banned its sale during summers since 2011. The type of fuel Biden is targeting is known as E15 gasoline, a petroleum fuel combined with a 15% ethanol blend. Ethanol is made from the fermentation of starchy plants, usually corn. Since 2011, the EPA has banned the sale of E15 in most of the country from June 1 and Sept. 15, because it contributes to air pollution when outside temperatures are high. E15 is still sold in 30 states, but only at around one out of every 65 gas stations in the country, according to the Department of Energy. A less potent form of the mixture—known as E10, which only uses a 10% ethanol blend—has been approved for general use by the EPA for years. In a call previewing Tuesday's announcement, reported by Reuters, Biden administration officials said that the ethanol blend will be 10 cents cheaper per gallon on average than regular gas. “Those savings can add up, especially during the summer months, when fuel is elevated,” one White House representative said. For E15 to be sold during summer, Biden has requested a waiver from the EPA, although it would not be the first time the agency will have granted one. In 2019, the Trump White House filed a similar request, citing a “​​commitment to energy independence, regulatory reform, and increasing the use of biofuels to give consumers more choices.” The EPA granted the waiver, achieving rare condemnation from both environmental groups, which worried about the health and climate risks of E15, and oil companies, which did not want biofuels to cut into their profits. For Biden, the priority is to reduce gas prices, and do it fast. High gas prices are now a leading cause of inflation, and the President and his party are being blamed by many voters for prolonged high prices at the pump. The White House has tried to place responsibility for high gasoline prices on Russia and its ongoing war in Ukraine, and even calling the surge “Putin’s price hike.” Biden has already tried several strategies to increase oil supply and lower prices. The U.S. is spearheading a global effort to release 240 million barrels of oil from emergency reserves before the end of the year, with 180 million coming from the U.S.. Biden is also pushing for U.S. oil companies to ramp up production, and has made diplomatic approaches to increase oil trade flows with other countries.

4/14/2022,"Amazon has brought its checkout-free ""Just Walk Out"" technology to airports, grocery stores and other shops, but now it's coming to a particularly useful place for sports fans: the ballpark. The Houston Astros have teamed up with Amazon to install Just Walk Out systems at two concession stores in Minute Maid Park. Visit 19th Hole or Market and you can buy snacks or souvenirs between innings by inserting your credit card at the entry gate, grabbing things off the shelf, and leaving when you're done. There will be staff to greet you and offer help as necessary, and you'll still have to show ID if you're buying alcohol. However, you otherwise won't have to talk to a cashier or use a self-checkout system. As you might guess, that could be extremely helpful given the crowds and lineups that frequently slow you down in stadiums. The Astros' stadium is the first in Major League Baseball to adopt Just Walk Out, and they're using the same slightly modified system Amazon is offering to other retailers. The tech uses computer vision and other forms of AI to track shoppers as they enter and take (or put back) items. Amazon's own stores just rely on the company's Go mobile app instead of credit cards. Amazon didn't mention whether or not other MLB teams would embrace the zero-checkout offering, but it won't be surprising if they (and other sports leagues) do. Stadium operators depend heavily on both merch sales and a swift traffic flow to turn a profit — the cost of Just Walk Out could easily be worthwhile if increases the chances you'll buy an expensive hot dog or replica jersey.",Technology/Engadget,Houston Astros' stadium will be the first in MLB to use Amazon's 'Just Walk Out' tech,https://news.yahoo.com/houston-astros-amazon-just-walk-out-shopping-152141941.html
4/14/2022,"Bill Maher continues to insist that his politics haven’t changed — but the landscape is shifting beneath his feet so fast that the prolific GOP-bashing host of HBO’s “Real Time” suggested on Joe Rogan’s podcast this week that even he may have a tipping point to cross over to the Republican Party. Maher, the staunch liberal who ushered politics into late night with “Politically Incorrect” and now “Real Time” on HBO, has had taken many sojourns into centrist and center-right thinking of late. He and Rogan likened their mutual centrism to a rare form of “common sense” on the “Joe Rogan Experience” podcast that debuted Tuesday. Maher suggested that runaway government spending — and the grift that comes along with it — just might be the thing that changes his stripes. Rogan and Maher began by riffing on the enormous spending packages the federal government has floated of late, including the Democrats’ doomed “Build Back Better” package and the Trump-era COVID-19 stimulus packages, and how much of that money winds up in the hands of fraudsters and grifters. “People would say to me, ‘Oh, you’re complaining [like a Republican] about the government spending money,” Maher said. “OK, but is there any number at which I am not tipped over to the Republican side? That I can’t complain about money that’s just being stolen?” Like everyone, Maher apparently has a price. (Watch the video clip below). Maher went on to make the connection to California’s now-defunct Pacific Coast railroad line, which absorbed hundreds of millions of federal and state dollars only to break down and fade to oblivion. “As a good liberal, I totally accept the notion that ‘You cannot transfer money without a leaky bucket,'” Maher continued. “I get it. It can’t be perfect. But is there no number for which I cannot remonstrate against this?” “California tried to build a railroad,” Maher said. “Makes sense, cars, good for the environment, blah blah blah. When they finally pulled the plug, it was $200 million a mile. Now France, not unknown to have unions and workers’ rights, did it for like, one-seventh [of the cost].” Maher also acknowledged that had Build Back Better passed, it, too, would have been ripe for the picking. “When I hear about ‘Build Back Better,’ certainly the country needs to be rebuilt,” Maher said. “The infrastructure is a mess. But I’m always thinking like, when you give me a number [in this case, $1.5 trillion], it seems like you pulled it out of your ass. And it came in right at that round number, huh? … what if we only spend $1.2 trillion? What would we be saving? Because so much money is going to consultants — all the pigs at the trough.” Maher said that kind of thinking is not a Republican idea, it’s more like … “Common sense?” Rogan replied. “Common sense!” exclaimed Maher. “Yes!”",U.S./The Wrap,Bill Maher Reveals the One Thing That Might ‘Tip Me Over to the Republican Side’,https://news.yahoo.com/bill-maher-reveals-one-thing-152450182.html
4/14/2022,"The Michigan Attorney General’s office has charged a off-duty DeWitt police officer with felony charges connected to a 2021 incident with a Black teen, where he pulled a gun out on him twice without reasonable cause. The teen also has secured legal representation and filed his own federal civil lawsuit. According to a press release from the state attorney general Dana Nessel, officer Chad Vorce was arraigned on Thursday, April 7, on the below: One count of misconduct in office, a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and/or $10,000 Felonious assault with a dangerous weapon, a felony punishable by up to four years in prison and/or $2,000 Felony firearm possession: a felony punishable by two years consecutively with and preceding any term of imprisonment imposed for the felony or attempted felony conviction in a Clinton County District Court. Vorce initially was fired for these crimes, but reinstated months later after the department said “he has learned his lesson” and showed a “genuine demonstration of remorse” for his actions. The state believes a court of law should determine this. The AG’s investigation found Vorce, who was not on duty at the time of the incident, broke the law when he pulled a gun out on Alexander Hamilton, a 19-year-old paperboy on Jan. 14, 2021, despite his belief the boy was “driving erratically in his neighborhood.” Nessel said, “Our assessment of this incident showed dangerous behavior exhibited by Mr. Vorce. Those who swear to protect and serve must do so responsibly. We will not hesitate to hold accountable those who violate that oath.” A day after these charges were made, Hamilton filed his own federal lawsuit, alleging the 18-year-veteran officer and his colleagues violated his Fourth and 14th Amendment rights by the use of excessive force, illegal seizure, false arrest and false imprisonment on that early spring morning. He also alleged these state authorities racially discriminated —pointing to Vorce identifying him by race when reporting the incident to others. The lawsuit, which plays off the young man’s name by using a rendering of the opening song of the Hamilton Broadway musical based on the founding father with the same name, records the teen was on an assigned route to drop off papers when he encountered the off-duty officer. His lawyer Dustyn Coontz explains his client was in the area of Shadybrook Lane and Driftwood Drive, which is in Watertown Township, Clinton County, around 7:15 a.m., on the day of the altercation only to perform his job’s duties. Vorce saw the teen’s minivan while he was taking his child to school and determined he was “driving in a manner that he claims to have been suspicious.” “According to Vorce, there had been some theft-related crimes in his neighborhood recently,” the lawsuit states. “Upon seeing a ‘frickin’ Black guy’ in a black hoodie, Vorce became even more suspicious that Hamilton was a potential criminal.” The officer, who doubled as a volunteer firefighter, approached the teen and asked him what he was doing. Hamilton allegedly responded, “I’m just doing me.” At this point, frustrated he could not get the answer he wanted, nor the van’s plates to run his tags, he called the Clinton County Central Dispatch for assistance. The claim says the first line of the CAD report read — another indicator that race was an issue — “BLK MALE IN THE AREA JUST DOING ME NEEDS CHECKED.” Vorce now started to follow Hamilton in his vehicle. Ultimately, the van backed up on Vorce (twice) and each time, the officer believed this was an attempted assault on him. He reported to “dispatch he was ‘going to go shots fired’ if Hamilton did it again.” Hamilton alleged he was trying to get away, but that Vorce’s vehicle gave him no room for him to make a U-turn. The officer claimed at this time the teen tried to “ram” his truck again, got out of his truck and “pulled his pistol out on Hamilton” the first time. When he returned to his truck, he told dispatch, the lawsuit alleges, “this was now a priority call and that things would ‘turn out really bad’ if help didn’t arrive quickly.” Simultaneously, Hamilton said, fearful for his life, he tried to escape to a public place, the Sunoco (AKA Tailgaters) at 3955 Ernest Way, thinking Vorce would not do anything violent there. Off duty officer Chad Vorce pulled his GUN on a teen who was delivering newspapers and said “when I see a Black guy … I think you’re doing stuff like this.” This use of force & bias is DISGUSTING. Thankfully, the teen was not hurt and Vorce was fired! pic.twitter.com/V8hb0rnmkG — Ben Crump (@AttorneyCrump) November 15, 2021 Vorce continued to challenge the teen, but this time using “wigwagging” headlights” and “emergency light” to represent himself in his occupational capacity. When he emerged from the vehicle, he identified himself as a police officer, before pulling out the gun on Hamilton for the second time. The lawsuit reveals Officer Clyde Smith, a cop that works in the same department as Vorce, arrived at the scene, despite the location of this incident being out of the jurisdiction of the DPD. “Smith has claimed he responded because he was close to the scene and was there to assist Michigan State Police in its investigation and that he didn’t know Vorce was the complainant,” the lawyer writes. “But Smith would’ve known from radio traffic that Vorce—or “7602” or “602,” as dispatch routinely called him—was the complainant.” The filing says Smith removed the delivery driver from his van and started to arrest “him citing the possibility that Hamilton committed assault with a dangerous weapon by trying to ram Vorce.” During this process, Michigan State police trooper Luke Shafer arrived on the scene. He and Smith interviewed both Hamilton and Vorce, but did not stop their colleague from engaging the teen. Shafer later consulted with two other sergeants at the Lansing Post and found there was no basis to arrest Hamilton. Hamilton’s lawsuit names Vorce, Smith, DeWitt police chief Bruce Ferguson and the City of DeWitt as defendants. It claims the ordeal has caused the plaintiff to “suffer emotional distress” and the officer’s actions were “extreme and outrageous.” The city and chief are listed as “Smith was in uniform and responded to the scene in a marked patrol car, so everything he did here was plainly under the color of State Law,” operating with an authority those parties gave him. He is suing for damages for the “emotional and psychological injuries” caused by being exposed to police-involved violence, “punitive damages for the defendants’ intentional and outrageous conduct demonstrating evil motive and a reckless or callous indifference to Hamilton’s rights” and lawyer fees. Hamilton also wants Vorce to be barred from law enforcement “until the day he dies.” Vorce has not answered the lawsuit and is scheduled to appear before Judge Michael E. Clarizio in the 65A District Court.

4/14/2022,"By Josh Smith SEOUL (Reuters) -The USS Abraham Lincoln strike group is operating in waters off the Korean peninsula, the U.S. Navy said on Tuesday, amid tensions over North Korea's missile launches and concerns that it could soon resume testing nuclear weapons. ""The Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group is conducting bilateral operations with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force in the Sea of Japan,"" Commander Hayley Sims, a spokesperson for the Japan-based U.S. Seventh Fleet, said in a statement. This is the first time since 2017 that a carrier group has deployed to the waters between South Korea and Japan, and comes as U.S. officials are increasingly concerned that North Korea could carry out an underground nuclear test in the coming days. Sims said the carrier was conducting ""routine bilateral operations"" to reassure our allies and partners of the U.S. commitment to maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific. ""Our training enhances the credibility of conventional deterrence by demonstrating the strength of our bilateral partnerships,"" she added. On March 15 the USS Abraham Lincoln led military exercises in the Yellow Sea, launching its F-35 stealth fighters and other jets in what the U.S. military said was a demonstration in response to the increased pace and scale of North Korea's ballistic missile launches. Last month North Korea conducted a full test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) for the first time since 2017. During the last major flurry of ICBM and nuclear tests in 2017 the USS Ronald Reagan, Theodore Roosevelt and Nimitz, and their multi-ship strike groups, deployed to the Sea of Japan, also known in Korea as the East Sea, in a show of force. Advisers to South Korea's president-elect sought redeployment of U.S. strategic assets, such as aircraft carriers, nuclear bombers and submarines, to the Korean peninsula during talks held on a visit to Washington last week. South Korea's defence ministry said it was aware that the carrier group was in international waters but declined to comment further. North Korea has previously criticised U.S. military drills as a rehearsal for war, and said they increase tensions.
