3/11/2022,"Rishi Sunak will take some limited action to tackle the cost of living crisis in this month’s spring statement but will reject calls to beef up his much-criticised energy bill reduction scheme, government sources say. Amid mounting pressure from inside his own party, and with some City analysts predicting inflation could hit 10% within months, the chancellor has asked Treasury officials to draw up options for cushioning the blow for consumers. But Treasury sources stress that the government cannot protect the public from what is a global crisis – and underline the fact that the public finances are weaker than at the start of the pandemic, when Sunak took radical steps, including the furlough scheme. “We have dealt with one crisis that was supposed to be once-in-a-generation, and we have just walked into another one,” they said. “There’s only so much that can be done, and we’ve never seen oil prices where they are now.” One widely mooted option would be to raise state benefits by more than the 3.1% pencilled in at last autumn’s budget, which looks set to amount to a hefty real-terms cut, given the rapid increase in inflation since. Torsten Bell, director of thinktank the Resolution Foundation, said: “Fast-rising inflation and income falls on a scale only seen in recessions will be the defining economic feature of the year ahead. The war in Ukraine has only deepened the squeeze that households will face. “The chancellor cannot protect the country from the economic pain that higher energy prices bring, but he can decide who bears the burden. His top priority for the spring statement should be to ensure benefits don’t fall £10bn behind the fast-rising cost of living.” Other options could include a further cut to the universal credit taper rate, which Sunak reduced in his October budget, allowing claimants to keep more as their earnings go up; or unfreezing personal tax allowances, which are due to drag more people into paying higher rates. The former Tory prime minister David Cameron has called on the government to cut taxes in the teeth of the crisis – but while Sunak has insisted he wants to be a tax-cutting chancellor, he remains committed to April’s 1.25 percentage point increase in national insurance contributions to pay for health and social care. Domestic fuel bills are expected to rise by an average of almost £700 a year when the price cap set by the regulator Ofgem is raised in April. In response, Sunak has promised a £150 council tax rebate for properties in bands A to D next month, and a £200 cut to energy bills in October, to be repaid over five years. Labour have attacked the buy-now-pay-later nature of the scheme, and called for a more generous package, funded by a windfall tax on the energy companies. Boris Johnson defended the plan robustly on Wednesday at prime minister’s questions, but it later emerged that his team had commissioned Kwasi Kwarteng’s business department (BEIS) to look at ways of making it more generous. First revealed by Politico, these are understood to include doubling the energy bill cut, to £500 – but crucially, they would not be implemented until October, the next time regulator Ofgem is due to update the price cap. Surging oil and gas prices since Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting sanctions on Russia have led to predictions that bills could be set to soar once again in the autumn. But a Treasury source said it was not yet clear whether the energy bill scheme would need to be strengthened: “We’re not in the business of putting together policy responses when we’re not sure what the problem we’re trying to solve is”. BEIS officials stressed that it was not unusual to be asked to come up with policy options for future contingencies – but the fact Number 10 asked for the work underlines the scale of concern in government about soaring living costs. Privately, many Conservative MPs say they believe Sunak’s February cost of living measures now appear inadequate. “It just won’t cut it,” one backbencher said. Sunak told an audience at the London School of Economics earlier this month: “As ever part of my job is always to be listening to people and making sure the policies that we’ve got in place are the right ones to help the economy, to help families and people can judge me on my track record about how we do that.”",News/Business,Sunak considers limited extra measures to tackle cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/10/sunak-considers-limited-extra-measures-to-tackle-cost-of-living-crisis
3/11/2022,"You can only imagine the kompromat that Priti Patel must have on the prime minister. As international development secretary in Theresa May’s government, she had been sacked for going rogue with her own foreign policy. Her flight back to the UK from Kenya had been tracked every bit as closely as those made by Russian oligarchs today. For most politicians that would have been an end to their career. But not Priti Vacant. When Boris Johnson became prime minister he promoted her to home secretary. Then came the inquiry that found Patel guilty of breaking the ministerial code for bullying staff. That again should have been enough for instant dismissal. Instead The Suspect ordered colleagues to protect “The Prittster” at all costs. And so she survived; to bumble on with her characteristic mix of incompetence and viciousness. No more so than during the current war in Ukraine. While most other government departments have upped their game over the past weeks, the Home Office has been a national embarrassment. While other European countries have opened their borders to welcome refugees, the UK went out of its way to make it almost impossible for any Ukrainians to reach this country: from not disclosing where most of the visa application centres were situated to making sure those that were advertised were closed. Cue hundreds of refugees being sent on pointless journeys from Calais to Lille to Paris. And back. None of this has gone down well with MPs on any side of the house. On Monday, Vacant had managed to give the Commons the wrong information about which visa application centres were open and where they were – one hesitates to say she lied as she’s genuinely stupid enough not to be across the finer details of what her department is up to. The following day, she had gone awol during an urgent question about the Home Office’s mishandling of the refugee crisis and let a junior immigration minister take the hit instead. Not that Kevin Foster seemed to mind. He went on Twitter to say that refugees could always take advantage of the seasonal agricultural workers scheme. Because picking fruit would help to take their mind off the war. But on Thursday Patel did bother to come to the Commons in person to answer yet another urgent question on refugees. Partly because she needed to reassure Tory MPs that she had at least some idea what was going on; partly because this time she actually had something new to say. Though she did look initially a bit bewildered. She was under the impression – as most of us had been – that her sole role was to win favour with the Tory right by being beastly to foreigners. Something at which she excels. Vacant can’t quite get her head around the fact that all of a sudden every Tory backbencher – with the exception of Edward Leigh and Daniel Kawczynski – had gone soft on refugees. But Patel gathered herself and ploughed on with the script. To make things easier, refugees with Ukrainian passports and family in the UK would now be allowed to apply for their visas online. Quite how this would work for refugees whose passports were lost or missing in the chaos of war, she didn’t say. Nor how people without data roaming on their phones would manage to upload their visa applications. Even assuming they could still manage to charge their phones. In any case, none of this could start until next Tuesday as the Home Office needed to ensure all necessary security measures were in place. Though, given that the Russians had been planning the invasion for months, you’d have thought they had all the spies they wanted in place in the UK without trying to pass a few off as Ukrainian refugees. This was a start, said Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary. But why had it taken yet another urgent question to shame Patel into action at the dispatch box? And why was there still no clear humanitarian pathway for refugees without immediate family in the UK? For reasons best known to herself, Cooper went along with the security rhetoric. Almost as if Labour was terrified of being seen to be weak on immigration. Even though every other country in Europe was taking unlimited numbers of refugees without visas. And that the majority of people in the UK are in favour of this country doing the same. Labour’s response is to be a bit nicer than the Tories, but not too much. Vacant, however, was a model of indignation. Contrary to appearances, she hadn’t been dragged to the Commons. She had been gagging to be asked. It’s just that she was a little shy and didn’t want to appear too pushy. Patel: the model of modesty. And the Tories had a “world-beating” record on refugees. This one again. No matter how often she and Boris repeat it, it doesn’t make it true. The UK may score well in the narrow band of “resettled refugees” but on refugees in general we’re hopeless. Per head of capita, we barely make the top 20 of the most welcoming European countries. Then came the moment that – temporarily at least – silenced the entire chamber. The visas and the bureaucracy were actually doing the refugees a favour, Patel continued. Because if we had an open border policy and let in as many as wanted to come, then we’d have a Windrush situation where people couldn’t prove they had leave to remain. This was Vacant at either her most vicious or her most stupid. Because it wasn’t the lack of paperwork that was the problem for the Windrush generation. It was the hostile environment that sought to deport people who were legally entitled to be here – the lack of full paperwork was just a means to that end. A hostile environment policy dreamed up by Theresa May in 2012 and slavishly pursued by Patel a decade later. Most MPs were in a forgiving mood though. Ready to congratulate Patel on her baby steps towards humanity, rather than to castigate her for the all too obvious shortcomings in her plans. There again, there was every chance the home secretary would be back in the Commons to explain another policy disaster in the coming weeks. Time was on their side. If not on the side of those fleeing the war.",News/Politics,Is Priti Patel vicious or stupid?

3/11/2022,"What has happened?On Thursday morning, the Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, had his assets frozen as part of a range of British government sanctions against seven Russian “pro-Kremlin” oligarchs closely linked with Vladimir Putin’s regime. It means that Abramovich can no longer sell Chelsea or make money from owning it. The club is also now subject to a special government licence which strictly regulates what they can and cannot do, and makes it a criminal offence if they do not comply. What are Chelsea barred from doing?From now on, only season-ticket holders and those who have already bought tickets will be allowed to attend Chelsea games. The club is no longer permitted to transfer or loan players, while broadcast and prize money is also frozen. On Thursday lunchtime, the official Chelsea club shop was also forced to close. However, the club can continue to play fixtures and are permitted to have “reasonable travel costs” to and from games up to a maximum of £20,000. Fans at games will still be able to buy food and drink. What has been the reaction inside Chelsea?The club were blindsided by the timing of the government’s decision and, understandably, there has been some alarm among players and their agents. One dressing room source described the situation as “chaos” and said that people feared the club could enter administration. Such talk is probably premature. However, there is certainly huge uncertainty swirling around Stamford Bridge. The men’s team have three first-team players whose deals are will end in the summer: César Azpilicueta, Antonio Rüdiger and Andreas Christensen. Five women’s players – Ann-Katrin Berger, Maren Mjelde, Jonna Andersson, Ji So-yun and Drew Spence – are also set to leave at the end of the season. What will Abramovich do next?That is the £1bn question. Government sources have stressed that the Russian will not make a penny from any sale. Essentially, Abramovich has two choices: to sell the club he has owned since 2003 and walk away quietly as a hero to many supporters, or stay and fight, which could lead to further sanctions and the club being run down. Even if Abramovich decides to go gracefully, the government will have to issue another licence to allow that to happen. It is also unclear where the money – which could be more than £1bn – could end up, with discussions continuing between the Treasury, the Premier League and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. As one source put it: “The primary thing today is about taking action on oligarchs with close ties to the Kremlin. We’re working through some of those wider implications, including around a potential sale at the moment.” What about Chelsea’s sponsors?Three, the British telecoms company which is the team’s principal shirt sponsor on a deal believed to be worth around £40m a year, has confirmed it is suspending its partnership with the club. A spokesperson said: “In light of the government’s recently announced sanctions, we have requested Chelsea Football Club temporarily suspend our sponsorship of the club, including the removal of our brand from shirts and around the stadium until further notice. “We recognise that this decision will impact the many Chelsea fans who follow their team passionately. However, we feel that given the circumstances, and the government sanction that is in place, it is the right thing to do. As a mobile network, the best way we can support the people of Ukraine is to ensure refugees arriving in the UK from the conflict and customers currently in Ukraine can stay connected to the people who matter to them. Therefore, we are offering connectivity packages to all Ukrainians arriving in the UK, and those in Ukraine.” Hyundai, Chelsea shirt sleeve sponsor, has also released a statement. It reads: “Hyundai has become one of the strongest partners in football over the years & the company supports the sport to be a force for good. We are currently assessing the situation with Chelsea FC.” Their deal is reportedly worth £10m a year. Does the news lead to wider questions for English football?Undoubtedly. Chelsea are not the only Premier League club whose owners and sponsors have been called into question. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund has a majority stake in Newcastle. The Abu Dhabi United Group runs Manchester City. Meanwhile last week, Everton suspended all sponsorship deals with the Uzbek oligarch Alisher Usmanov. While the decision to sanction Abramovich was welcomed by Tracey Crouch, the MP who chaired the recent fan-led review into football governance, she said it illustrated the need for better scrutiny of owners and directors. “There has been a huge desire for this to happen,” Crouch said. “But I would also say that the situation at Chelsea does demonstrate, yet again, why we need an independent regulator with really tough owners’ tests,. It’s not going to solve this particular problem. But a lot of the issues involved are highlighted in the fan-led review.”",Sport/Football,Roman Abramovich hit by sanctions: what does it mean for Chelsea?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/10/roman-abramovich-sanctioned-what-does-it-mean-for-chelsea
3/11/2022,"The only NHS gender identity service for children in England and Wales is under unsustainable pressure as the demand for the service outstrips capacity, a review has found. The interim report of the Cass Review, commissioned by NHS England in 2020, recommends that a network of regional hubs be created to provide care and support to young people with gender incongruence or dysphoria, arguing their care is “everyone’s business”. Led by the paediatrician Hilary Cass, the interim report explains that the significant rise in referrals to the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) at the Tavistock and Portman NHS foundation trust in London has resulted in overwhelmed staff and waiting lists of up to two years that leave young people “at considerable risk” of distress and deteriorating mental health. The number of referrals to the service went from 138 in 2010-11 to 2,383 in 2020-21. Last spring, the Care Quality Commission demanded monthly updates on numbers on waiting lists and actions to reduce them in a highly critical report on GIDS. Differing views and lack of open discussion about the nature of gender incongruence in childhood and adolescence – and whether transition is always the best option – means that patients can experience a “clinician lottery”, says the review, which carried out extensive interviews with professionals and those with lived experience. It notes that the clinical approach used by GIDS “has not been subjected to some of the usual control measures” typically applied with new treatments. The report says there are often tensions between the expectations of the young person – who often wants rapid access to physical interventions after a long, challenging wait to be seen – and the responsibilities of the clinician. Another significant issue raised with the review team was that of “diagnostic overshadowing”, whereby once identified as having gender-related distress, other complex needs – such as neurodiversity or a mental health problem that would normally be managed by local services – can be overlooked. While noting that “many of the challenges and knowledge gaps that we face in the UK are echoed internationally”, the review group raises serious concerns about the lack of data collection by GIDS and more broadly, especially on outcomes for the recent increase in girls questioning their gender identity. In a letter directly to children and young people at the beginning of the report, Cass assures readers that her belief is that “more services are needed for you, closer to where you live”. But she also cautions them that “there is still a lot we don’t know about the long-term effects” of hormone treatments. Last September the court of appeal overturned a judgment that children under the age of 16 are unlikely to be mature enough to give informed consent to be prescribed puberty-blocking drugs. Cass writes that the review group will spend the next few months assessing all available information on hormone treatments. “I am currently emphasising the importance of making decisions about prescribing as safe as possible. This means making sure you have all the information you need – about what we do know and what we don’t know.” Regional hubs would bring treatment closer to those who need it, allow more clinicians from a variety of backgrounds to offer support and develop agreement and guidance about the appropriate clinical assessment process that should take place, underpinned by better data and evidence, the reports suggests. A spokesperson for the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust welcomed “the focus of on increasing and broadening the care and support available for this group of patients who are currently waiting far too long and on developing the evidence base”.",News/Society,"NHS gender identity service for children can’t cope with demand, review finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/10/nhs-gender-identity-service-for-children-cant-cope-with-demand-review-finds
3/11/2022,"The main NHS hospital in Cornwall has been forced to suspend almost all visiting after a “significant” spike in the number of patients with Covid. Eighty-five patients at the Royal Cornwall hospital in Truro have tested positive for the coronavirus, meaning that many wards and bays are unable to take in new admissions. According to the latest figures published by Cornwall council the seven-day case rate for Cornwall is 376 per 100,000 people, compared with 313 for England as a whole. A spokesperson for Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust said: “Over the last few days there has been a significant increase in the number of people in hospital who are Covid positive. “Although the vast majority of the 85 people have been admitted for another reason, it means we have many wards or bays unable to take new admissions.” The spokesperson said the hospital would consider visits in “exceptional circumstances”, such as to say goodbye to a patient who is dying. The current visiting arrangements for maternity, neonatal and paediatrics remain unchanged. “We will be making every effort to resume visiting as soon as we can but we must reduce the number of people coming into our hospitals to a minimum, and it is likely we will have to keep this restriction in place for at least the next seven days,” the spokesperson added. The trust’s deputy medical director, Dr Gill Derrick said: “Although all patients are tested on admission, we are finding many have been unknowingly carrying the virus. “When a Covid test later in their admission proves positive, it means we must close a bay, or in some cases a whole ward, for at least 10 days. This has a big knock-on impact for patients waiting for admission and ultimately ambulances waiting to hand over their patients. All of our health and care services continue to be under significant pressure.” Dr Ruth Goldstein, of Cornwall’s public health team, said Covid was still causing “havoc” with many people’s lives. “Everybody seems to know somebody who has got Covid. It absolutely hasn’t gone away,” she said. Andrew George, a Lib Dem councillor who speaks for the party on health issues in Cornwall, said: “The Conservative government sets the tone and climate as well as the rules. The prime minister follows public opinion rather than science, chases headlines and has no respect for his own rules. “Ministers and portfolio holders must stand aside and let public health officials set standards for social distancing, mask wearing and personal hygiene.

3/11/2022,"Ministers must introduce tougher sentences for femicide and investigate whether female suicides are the result of domestic violence in order to tackle brutality against women and girls, the Labour MP Jess Phillips has urged, as she cited in parliament the names of 128 women killed in the past year. Phillips told MPs these demands will be included in a “families’ manifesto for change” that she and the Labour party are working on with the families of the victims she has included on her lists, which she has shared with parliament for seven years running. “Each one had stories to tell about their daughters being murdered, the perpetrators on bail … or killings that went uninvestigated because the woman had taken drugs,” she said. Speaking in parliament at a debate held in honour of International Women’s Day on 8 March, Phillips was joined by the family of two young women killed by their ex-partners, Carol, Matt and Zeb Gould, the parents and brother of Ellie Gould, a 17-year-old sixth-form student; and Julie Devey, mother of Poppy Devey Waterhouse, a 24-year-old quantitative trading analyst. The family members have campaigned since February 2020 to change the minimum sentence for domestic murder. Although their daughters suffered multiple injuries after they were brutally stabbed, and the killers tried to hide their crimes, the guidelines for murder sentencing meant that both received minimum tariffs set at less than 20 years in prison. In the case of Gould’s killer, it was because he was under 18, and for Devey Waterhouse, because killings in the home using an implement found at the scene – such as a kitchen knife – are given lesser sentences. Phillips sourced the names of the murdered women from the Counting Dead Women project, led by campaigner Karen Ingala Smith.Phillips told MPs it should be the government’s responsibility to keep track of murdered women, rather than requiring women such as Ingala Smith “to give away their labour for free in the pursuit of their own safety”. The list also included Sabina Nessa, a 28-year-old teacher whose killer was recently convicted in a high-profile trial that gained public attention for its parallels with the murder of Sarah Everard. The two cases prompted an outpouring of fury from women over the lack of action to tackle violence against women and girls.Before reading the list, Phillips noted that the names of the women had all occurred since “that supposedly watershed moment”.She added: “Every name I’ll read, there will be a story of how better mental health services, even the slightest suggestion of offender management, or the availability of quick specialist victim support would have saved their lives.”",News/Society,"Ministers must introduce tougher sentences for femicide, says Jess Phillips ",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/10/ministers-must-introduce-tougher-sentences-for-femicide-says-jess-phillips
3/11/2022,"My friend David Smith, who has died aged 85, was a professor of geography at Queen Mary University of London and the author of 21 books that focused mainly on the intersection between human geography, ethics and moral philosophy. Much of his work centred around compelling case studies from research in South Africa, Palestine, Australia, the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe, looking in particular at the geographical causes of inequality and social injustice and what might be done about them. David was born in Solihull in the West Midlands to James, who ran a secretarial agency, and Elizabeth (nee McIlquham), a draftswoman. After attending Solihull school he studied geography at Nottingham University, where he met Margaret Harrup, a fellow student who became a social worker. They were married in 1961 and collaborated on a number of projects, including as co-authors of a book, The United States: How They Live and Work, published in 1973. David’s first post was as a lecturer at the University of Manchester from 1964 to 1966, when he moved with Margaret and his family to the US, where he lectured first at the University of Southern Illinois at Carbondale (1966-68) and then the University of Florida in Gainesville (1968-72). There were short visiting lectureships at the Universities of Natal and the Witwatersrand in South Africa and the University of New England in Australia in 1973, before he moved to Queen Mary University of London that year, remaining there until retirement in 2002. Most of his books were written while he was at Queen Mary, and he was most proud of his last two, Geography and Social Justice (1994) and Moral Geographies: Ethics in a World of Difference (2000). Both are notable for their commitment to bringing human geography and moral philosophy into politically relevant dialogue. Although he also wrote 104 academic papers over the years, David was not one for starry appearances at international conferences, although he was invited to many. What mattered for him was personal contact with students and colleagues, changing their lives through simple conversation. He was a private and family-oriented person, humble about his achievements, a man who loved to travel, eat out and listen to music, especially Elgar and jazz. Margaret died in 2002.

3/11/2022,"The mobile phone company Three has suspended its sponsorship of Chelsea and asked the club to remove the logo from their shirts with immediate effect. The news came after Chelsea’s owner, Roman Abramovich, was placed under sanctions by the UK government for being “associated with a person who is or has been involved in destabilising Ukraine and and undermining and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, namely Vladimir Putin, with whom Abramovich has had a close relationship for decades”. Three said in a statement on Thursday afternoon: “In light of the government’s recently announced sanctions, we have requested Chelsea Football Club temporarily suspend our sponsorship of the club, including the removal of our brand from shirts and around the stadium until further notice.” The club have been granted a special licence that will allow them to fulfil their fixtures. Broadcast and prize money will be frozen and the licence is limited to “football-related activity”, leading to the ban on signing players and new contracts – and other commercial restrictions. It means Abramovich will need approval from the UK government before selling the Stamford Bridge club. Three added: “We recognise that this decision will impact the many Chelsea fans who follow their team passionately. However, we feel that given the circumstances, and the government sanction that is in place, it is the right thing to do.” It is believed that the Three deal was worth around £40m a year to Chelsea and another sponsor, the shirt sleeve sponsor, Hyundai, said it was looking into their deal with the club. “Hyundai has become one of the strongest partners in football over the years and the company supports the sport to be a force for good,” the car manufacturer said in a statement. “We are currently assessing the situation with Chelsea.” The Hyundai deal is reportedly worth £10m a year.

3/11/2022,"Russia’s siege of the city of Mariupol resumed in the dark hours of the morning, residents said on Thursday, at around 3am. “The windows are shaking. It’s fucking early today,” resident Angela Timchenko posted on Facebook. She described Russia’s latest bombardment of the city – now in its ninth day – as a “heavy downpour”. She added: “I think about where to find some tea and a drop of sugar.” It was “frosty outside and fiercely cold” inside Mariupol’s apartments, which are without heat. There was – as she put it – “no bitch snow, which means there will be no water”. Earlier in the week the city’s residents collected snow to drink. Without running water, Timchenko said, she was struggling to feed her family. “Tell me, is it possible to bake an egg in foil? I have six of them lying around. Kids would have had their breakfast,” she wrote. The destruction of the city continued, locals said. On Wednesday a Russian warplane dropped a bomb on Mariupol’s maternity hospital number nine. According to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the strike killed three people, including a girl. Seventeen patients and staff were injured. The photos of pregnant women being carried over a lunar landscape of rubble and smouldering craters outraged the world. This, Zelenskiy said, was genocide. Petro Andriushchenko, a member of Mariupol’s council, said genocide was still happening. The city was under “constant shelling” from Russian artillery, he said: from Grad and Smerch rockets and Tochka-U missiles. On Thursday missiles pulverised another residential district, clawing holes out of several buildings. Shells also landed on the city’s drama theatre, built in Soviet neo-classical style and located in the centre of town. According to Andriushchenko, Mariupol’s left bank, normally home to 135,000 people, is “no longer liveable”. “The other districts have critical damage. Most residential buildings are not usable,” he wrote on Telegram. The city was without electricity, heat, drinking water and gas, he added, saying the Russian Federation was effectively holding 350,000 people hostage. With bodies lying on the streets – it is too dangerous to collect them – the precise death-toll was unknowable. Andriushchenko said 1,200 people had perished “by rough calculations”. “We don’t know the exact number of people under the debris,” he explained. “The Russian army attacks directly so we can’t gather the dead or evacuate the wounded. All the hospitals are full. We have 2,500 beds.” A mass grave had been dug on the city’s outskirts, he said. For the sixth day in a row, the evacuation of Mariupol’s civilians failed to happen. Andriushchenko said Russian aircraft were deliberately targeting the road where buses were meant to collect people to take them to safety and to Ukrainian-controlled territory. “Airstrikes started from the early morning. Airstrike after airstrike. All the historic centre is under bombardment,” he said, adding that the city was home to around 50,000 children and 3,000 babies. Mariupol’s deputy mayor, Serhiy Orlov, has described living conditions as “medieval”. One resident, Sasha Volkov, corroborated this bleak account in a phone interview with the International Red Cross. He said many residents had no water for drinking, despite efforts by the city council to deliver bottles to major areas. Shops and pharmacies were looted four or five days ago. Some people had food; others, including parents with children, had run out, he said. The situation had become desperate, Volkov added. “People attack each other for food, or they smash someone’s car to take the petrol out. Residents are falling ill because of the cold.” The most precious commodity was wood, he said, for cooking food on open fires. Groups were roaming around destroyed houses, searching for something to eat, taking their chances, and boiling water from the stream. Volkov said his building was home to 65 people. They had a generator, which gave them power for three or four hours a day. Women and small children were accommodated in the basement, while others slept on the ground floor. Meat was unavailable, but there was a “sort of black market for vegetables”. “We try to do the best we can,” he said, coughing. Others are living underground in their cars. Tanya, an 18-year-old who grew up in Mariupol and is now in Germany, said her mother and brother were camping out in a basement garage. “It’s safer than their apartment, which is on the fifth floor,” she explained. “They’re sleeping in the car so they can keep a little bit warm and can charge their phone.” Tanya, who declined to give her surname, added: “There are around 10 or 12 people down there. My brother told me that everyone is trying to help each other. If someone has spare food or water, they share it.” Her mother had cooked a “huge amount of porridge” while there was still electricity and had filled up the bath with water in the first days after Russia’s invasion. “They did some shopping to stock up when the war started, but it’s never enough,” she said. “My mum said by phone they’ve lost so much weight because they’re so stressed. She said: ‘Without food, that’s fine, you know. We’re not scared any more – we’re just tired, tired from this situation. There’s no fear now. We kind of get used to all this. Shooting – that’s fine. Bombing – that’s fine.” The hunger pangs had faded. “They’re just so tired. They want to leave, they want to be safe,” Tanya said. There was a sense of frustration among residents at their hopeless situation – abandoned by Kyiv and the international community. Mariupol, located in the far south-east corner of Ukraine, on the sea of Azov, is sandwiched between the old frontline with pro-Russian separatists, 20km east of the city centre, and the Russian army, which has taken up positions on Mariupol’s western coastal outskirts. It is surrounded. In the north around Kyiv, Ukrainian forces have shot down Russian warplanes and peppered enemy tank columns using Turkish-made drones. The Ukrainian army in Mariupol has no anti-air missiles, it seems, and Russian jets are able to carry out bombing runs unimpeded. “Why is there no news about the glorious Bayraktar [drone] in the Mariupol area!!” Timchenko wrote on Facebook, in bitter tones. Some relatives of those trapped in Mariupol, meanwhile, do not know if their loved ones are alive or dead. Speaking from Vienna, Viky, 33, said that since on 2 March, she had been unable to contact her parents, Volodymyr and Irina, her grandmother, Galyna, 88, her sister, Julia, and her niece, Veronika. All were sheltering in a small basement in their house in the Primorsky district of Mariupol, the target of repeated Russian bombing. Viky’s husband, Olsi, said: “The silence is just killing us. We do not know what’s happened to them. Are they alive or not alive? We have tried Mariupol city Telegram groups, and volunteers who’re trying to get information out to relatives, but we have heard nothing. During the early days of the invasion we could speak every day.” Olsi said their worst fear was that they would never find out what had happened to their family. “They have eight cellphones. We try all of them, all day long, from morning until night. The only positive thing that happened was two days ago, one of the cellphones rang two times. No one answered, no one picked up the phone. That they didn’t have the chance to pick up the phone is a terrifying thought.”",News/World news,No longer scared – just tired: conditions in Mariupol now ‘medieval’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/not-scared-tired-conditions-mariupol-siege-medieval-ukraine
3/11/2022,"Roman Abramovich has been a prominent and controversial figure since 2003, when he bought Chelsea football club, and the document imposing sanctions on him cites contracts he received before the 2018 World Cup. So why has nothing happened before now? There are various reasons, but much it boils down to one key factor: such things take time, and especially when compiling what officials stress has to be a “legally watertight” case against someone with access to extremely expensive lawyers. “You need an exceptionally high bar for these sorts of things,” one UK official connected to the process said. “Government lawyers are naturally a bit reticent, even if it is a very small risk.” Reading the entry for Abramovich on the list of new sanctions prepared by the Treasury’s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation it is nonetheless notable that none of the justifications for the asset freeze against the 55-year-old billionaire involve new developments. As a means of demonstrating Abramovich’s close links to Vladimir Putin, the document lists benefits he has received via the Russian president, including tax breaks for his companies, and contracts ahead of the 2018 World Cup, held in Russia. Similarly, his links to other Russian figures who have now had sanctions placed on them, and his controlling shareholding in steel company Evraz, which the UK government said potentially supplies material for Russian tanks, are both longstanding. UK officials dispute the idea that there has been an excessive delay in placing sanctions on Abramovich, pointing out that they have done so before he has faced any similar restrictions via the EU or US. While it is known that the UK government has been compiling information on Abramovich’s links to Putin for some time, one reason for delay cited by officials is the concern that human rights-based amendments to a 2018 sanctions law made the process more difficult – although legal experts, including crossbench peer Lord Pannick, who tabled the amendments, dispute this. One definite issue has been government capacity, particularly building up a post-Brexit independent sanctions system, something which had in the past been done as part of the EU. This capacity has been increasing gradually, particularly following the new regime of so-called Magnitsky sanctions, imposed in 2020 against individuals accused of human rights abuses, and there are now notably more officials and government lawyers working on the issues. What has been imposed against Abramovich and six more Russian figures on Thursday is nonetheless comprehensive, banning those named from any sort of financial transaction in the UK and freezing all their assets. Abramovich is believed to own properties in the UK worth hundreds of millions of pounds, including a Kensington Palace Gardens mansion in central London. For properties that can be definitively traced to his ownership, not only will he not be able to sell or rent them, but he cannot employ any staff, whether a cleaner or gardener, or even have an electricity supply. It is undoubtedly the case that whatever the prior investigations into Abramovich’s connections, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine gave UK officials additional impetus in trying to get something done. It is also true that the source of Abramovich’s enormous wealth, amassed by taking control of various Russian oil assets in the 1990s, was questioned by some from the moment he arrived at Chelsea as a beaming if slightly reticent 36-year-old, one who would transform the club by pumping in an estimated £1.5bn of his own money. His once ubiquitous presence at Chelsea games, glad-handing the players as they lifted trophies, dried up after he experienced difficulties renewing his UK visa in 2018, although he was able to visit subsequently using his Israeli passport. If Abramovich were to try to see one last match at Stamford Bridge, the private plane on which he arrived would face being impounded. If he wants to see a future for the club he loves, his only apparent option is to sell it and forfeit any of the resultant money. It might have taken time, but barring unexpected legal challenges, it seems as if officials have made their watertight case.",News/World news,Why has Roman Abramovich not been hit with UK sanctions before?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/roman-abramovich-uk-sanctions
