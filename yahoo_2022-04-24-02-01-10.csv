4/24/2022,"(Reuters) - Star stock-picker Cathie Wood's Ark Invest this week snapped up shares of pandemic darlings including Roblox Corp, Roku Inc and Zoom Video Communications that have fallen out of favor this year. The asset manager's flagship ARK Innovation ETF has slumped 43% this year, lagging far behind the S&P 500's 7.7% decline as the prospect of aggressive U.S. policy tightening hammered the fund's hyper-growth stocks. Over the week, ARK bought 100,642 shares of e-commerce firm Shopify Inc, 329,073 of Zoom, 739,082 of gaming site Roblox and 575,648 of streaming device maker Roku. Wood's shopping spree came after a shocking subscriber loss at Netflix Inc triggered a selloff in stocks that thrived during COVID-19 lockdowns. The asset manager shed more than half a million shares of Snap Inc this week, ahead of the company's earnings. The Snapchat owner slipped nearly 2% in premarket trading on Friday after warning inflation could hurt revenue growth in the current quarter. Last week, Wood reiterated her bullish stance on the fund's biggest holding, Tesla Inc. ARK Innovation ETF's stake in Tesla is worth $969 million, or 10% of the fund's weight. The electric-car maker's stock is the only one among the fund's top 10 holdings that has climbed over the past year. The other nine - including Roku, Zoom and Teladoc Health - have plunged between 22% and 62%. Tesla's shares have climbed about 35% over the past year and rose 3% on Thursday after its results raced ahead of expectations.

4/24/2022,"If long waits or slow service suddenly bedevil a favorite restaurant, it may not be the fault of the employees you see — but rather the ones you don't. An acute labor shortage in the restaurant industry has pushed employment in the sector about 1.5 million jobs below pre-pandemic levels. Moreover, restaurant owners don't expect the problem to resolve itself anytime soon. Roughly half of them say recruiting and retention of employees will be their top challenge in 2022, according to a survey released in January by the National Restaurant Association. In a new interview, celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck told Yahoo Finance why restaurant owners have faced such trouble hiring. When the pandemic drove widespread restaurant closures and millions of employees lost their careers or took up other work, many found that they didn't want to return, Puck said. ""A lot of employees in our industry changed their lifestyle,"" said Puck, who co-founded three companies that operate more than 50 restaurants worldwide. ""They said, 'We don't want to work on Mother's Day, on Christmas Eve, or New Year's Eve, Saturday, Sunday.'"" ""A lot of these people didn't want to come back,"" he added. In this episode of Influencers, Andy sits down with Wolfgang Puck, the world famous restaurateur & chef, as they discuss Wolfgang's upcoming projects, how he's adjusting his menus for inflation, and why he doesn't like to be called a 'celebrity chef'. The labor shortage in the restaurant industry has persisted despite a dramatic rise in wages aimed at bringing workers back. Last year, as dining and travel habits returned to some semblance of normal, the high demand for workers in leisure and hospitality made it the only occupation that saw wage increases outpace inflation, as Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reported. Hourly wages for those workers jumped 11.8% in March compared to a year ago. The Austrian-born restaurateur lamented the failure to attract employees even with the high pay rate offered at Spago, his chain of high-end restaurants with locations in Beverly Hills, Las Vegas, Maui, and elsewhere. ""We have waiters at Spago that make over $120,000, $150,000,"" he said. ""So it's not a job which doesn't pay well, either."" But there is reason for optimism among restaurant owners. The industry has shown signs of increased hiring in recent months. The leisure and hospitality industry led all sectors in hiring last month by adding 112,000 jobs, with more than half of those jobs coming at food service and drinking places, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The hiring gains owe in part to growth in the industry as it bounces back from the pandemic. The food service industry workforce is expected to increase by 400,000 jobs, for total industry employment of 14.9 million workers by the end of 2022, the National Restaurant Association survey found. ""Little by little, they're coming back,"" Puck says. Max Zahn is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

4/24/2022,"Jack Dorsey, the Twitter co-founder and current Block CEO, is no longer the payments firm's ""chief executive officer."" Instead, the executive is choosing to call himself ""Block Head and Chairperson."" It's an unconventional title, sure, but it is perhaps fitting for the billionaire man, who is not known for his choice of words. A very real regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission reflects how no, this play on the term ""blockhead"" is not a joke. Yet like Elon Musk — who declared himself ""Technoking"" in March 2021 — the change may indeed be for the lolz. ""There will be no changes in Mr. Dorsey’s roles and responsibilities, and he will continue to serve as principal executive officer of the Company,"" the filing reads. Brutally, the filing also notes that the change was made ""at his request.""",Business/TechCrunch•18 hours ago,Block Head Jack Dorsey tells us what we already knew,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/block-head-jack-dorsey-tells-225810952.html
