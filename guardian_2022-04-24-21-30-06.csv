4/24/2022,"Eric Chappell, the writer of some of ITV’s most popular sitcoms, including Rising Damp, Only When I Laugh and Duty Free, has died at the age of 88. His death was revealed by the actor Reece Dinsdale, who starred alongside the late John Thaw in Chappell’s sitcom Home to Roost. Dinsdale wrote on Twitter: “Thank you for everything you did for me, Sir … your scripts were a complete joy to play. Great times!” Chappell was a prolific writer for theatre and television but his crowning achievement was Rising Damp, described as ITV’s finest ever sitcom by Mark Lewisohn, the author of the Radio Times Guide to comedy. It ran between 1974 and 1978 and had a magnificent central cast of four: Leonard Rossiter as the miserly, manic landlord Rigsby, Frances de la Tour as the dreamy romantic Miss Jones, Don Warrington as the suave Philip, who claims to be the son of an African chief, and Richard Beckinsale as the naive and good-natured medical student Alan. Rising Damp regularly attracted audiences of 18 million. Its many fans include the Guardian’s film editor, Catherine Shoard, who wrote in 2009: “At its best, it bears comparison with Beckett and Pinter.” Chappell told the Guardian last year that he had been concerned that Rigsby’s prejudicial attitude towards Philip might be misinterpreted as something to be celebrated or mimicked, as had happened with Johnny Speight’s Alf Garnett. The quality of the writing meant that was not the case. Chappell said he hoped he “had written an intelligent comedy about race relations”. Jed Mercurio, the writer of Line of Duty, described Chappell as “one of the all-time greats. His brilliant comedies entertained millions, week in week out, for decades.” Chappell was born in Grantham, Lincolnshire, in September 1933, and worked as an auditor for the East Midlands Electricity Board for 22 years. After several of his novels were rejected by publishers he decided to write plays, recognising that dialogue was his great skill. In his first play, The Banana Box, which became Rising Damp, Wilfred Brambell – then famous for Steptoe and Son – played the Rigsby character on stage. Chappell’s other sitcom credits included The Bounder, which starred Peter Bowles, who died five weeks ago. It was written with Bowles in mind after the success of Only When I Laugh, which starred Bowles, James Bolam and Christopher Strauli as seemingly permanent, hypochondriac hospital patients and Richard Wilson as their longsuffering consultant. Tim Reid, who co-created and co-wrote the BBC show Car Share, described Chappell as one of the greatest sitcom writers. “Worthy of a place amongst the greats for creating Rupert Rigsby alone,” he said. “But Only When I Laugh, often under-rated in my view, is not a bad follow up to Rising Damp. Hats off, sir.”",Arts/Television & radio,Rising Damp writer Eric Chappell dies at 88,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/24/rising-damp-writer-eric-chappell-dies-at-88
4/24/2022,"Keir Starmer has defended Labour’s determination to keep pressing the prime minister over parties in Downing Street during Covid lockdowns, saying even Conservative MPs were “sick of defending the indefensible”. Challenged about whether he had focused too much on Partygate, the Labour leader insisted his party could not just “pass over” the fact that Johnson had been issued with a fixed-penalty notice (FPN), along with Rishi Sunak and scores of officials. “They have been found to have broken the law – the criminal law at that,” he said. “No other prime minister in the history of our country has ever been found to have broken the law in office before. And I don’t think we can just pass over it.” Starmer said he would not pretend it did not matter, and that Johnson’s “authority to lead the country is shot through”. He added: “His own MPs now, as we saw on Thursday, don’t really want to defend him because they’re sick of defending the indefensible.” Johnson’s leadership has come under intense pressure in recent days, with senior MPs including Mark Harper and Steve Baker calling for him to go. The Conservative co-chair Oliver Dowden rejected the idea that Johnson should step down, saying there was a “very, very strong case for him remaining in office”. He insisted: “I don’t think I’m defending the indefensible. I do think that what happened in Downing Street was wrong and I do feel that people feel a great deal of legitimate hurt and anger over what happened, and therefore I think it was right for the prime minister to apologise”. Speaking on Sky News, Dowden praised Johnson’s record, saying he was “getting those big calls right” and had “real energy and determination”. He added that the uncertainty sparked by a leadership challenge would be “dearly damaging to this country”. Downing Street has insisted Johnson has not yet been fined for attending a “bring your own booze” garden party on 20 May 2020, for which at least some other attendees received FPNs on Friday. The prime minister has already admitted attending the gathering, described by his then principal private secretary in a leaked email as “socially distanced drinks”, but Johnson told MPs he “believed implicitly that this was a work event”. The Metropolitan police have not confirmed that they have issued fines over the 20 May gathering, and are declining to make any further public statements until after May’s local elections. But the Guardian has learned of at least one person who has been fined for attending the event. Starmer rejected the idea that the Partygate FPNs were minor punishments similar to parking fines, telling the BBC’s Sophie Raworth: “I tell you in all my days nobody has ever broken down in front of me in tears because they couldn’t go 35mph in a 30mph zone. People have broken down in front of me, in tears, because they couldn’t do what they wanted to because of the [Covid] rules.” He said the “raw human emotion” was the reason so many people felt strongly about Johnson’s behaviour. Johnson was forced into an embarrassing retreat last week after it became clear he would not succeed in whipping his own MPs to delay an inquiry by the House of Commons privileges committee into whether he misled parliament. The prime minister appeared to blame opposition critics for his continued travails, saying on a visit to India: “If the opposition want to focus on this and talk about it a lot more, that’s fine.” Starmer rejected the idea that Labour had failed to focus on other issues, pointing out that he had called for an emergency budget to tackle the cost of living crisis.",News/Politics,Partygate: Keir Starmer says Labour will keep pressing Boris Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/24/partygate-keir-starmer-says-labour-will-keep-pressing-boris-johnson
4/24/2022,"Everything about Gaslit (StarzPlay) is at the pinnacle of prestige television as it stands in 2022. It is based on a highly acclaimed podcast, Slow Burn (the Watergate season); it is a period drama that looks the business; it reframes a well-known historical story; and it is led by A-list movie stars, in this case Julia Roberts and Sean Penn. Once, this combination of ingredients would have made Gaslit a rare delicacy. Now, it joins all the other shows that mix similar elements and hope to alchemise them into something wonderful. Gaslit tells the story of the Watergate scandal, starting in January 1972, five months before that infamous break-in at the DNC headquarters. Plenty of people saw the clip of Dan Stevens on The One Show that went viral recently. “What you’ve got is a criminal for a leader who is wrapped in a messy war, embroiled in a stupid scandal and surrounded by ambitious idiots and really should resign,” he said, leading up to a punchline you could see coming from Mars. Wearing dark contact lenses, Stevens plays John Dean, a junior counsel at the White House, who finds himself tangled up in an increasingly fraught plot to spy on the Democrats, in order to gather intelligence on what the other side is up to in the run-up to the presidential election. In its early stages, at least, Gaslit proves to be a show of two halves. The attorney general, John Mitchell (a heavily transformed Penn, buried beneath layers of chins), leads a merry rabble of semi-idiots whose criminality is comically inept. They smoke, glower and borrow from the Thick of It school of creatively foul insults, though it never quite has the guts to go far enough, settling for outrage over wit. People are accused of doing terrible things to their sisters. “You’re gonna have to get your dick out of the butter churn on this one,” says Mitchell, ordering Dean to clear up the mess. It plays many of the macho antics for comedy, which works well, because it is often dealing with belief-defying stupidity. G Gordon Liddy –played by Shea Whigham with a moustache so impressive it should get its own special award at next year’s Emmys – is an Apocalypse Now-style menace, a sage spouting nonsense who likes to hold his hand over a burning flame. (This isn’t light on symbolism, and those familiar with the Martha Mitchell side of the story will spot many signposts along the way.) The scene in which he is challenged over the definition of a gemstone is pure silliness, and very funny. Watergate and Nixon are a familiar story to many, though, so in order to breathe some fresh air into it, the series takes a sideways glance, using “mouth of the south” Martha Mitchell (Roberts) and her husband as its way in. Martha Mitchell is, to all intents and purposes, the lead character here, and Roberts knows it. She is fantastic as the Washington wife and media personality who doesn’t play by the rules. “Get another wife if you want a silent one,” she snaps, when her husband tries to stop her from publicly expressing her views that the president is a liar and a cheat. Roberts is so good, in fact, that you miss Martha when she is not on screen, and she is not on screen enough. She is known as the “mouth of the south” for good reason, and freely airs her opinions on the Vietnam war and the administration behind it. She charms journalists, despite being told not to speak to the press, and sashays around the house testing the limits of the mischief she attempts to make. “You don’t do anything in secret,” says her daughter, gently setting up the justification – though few would call it that – for the horrors about to befall her. This side of the story is superior to the Four-Lions-at-the-White-House farce of the break-in, and it is far more intriguing, though it is fun to see Chris Bauer (of The Wire and The Deuce fame) as the half-chilling, half-bumbling James McCord. There is just a slight sense of unevenness. Episodes will air weekly, and there is a long wait for Martha to truly take centre stage, which feels like a waste of Roberts. When the story does take a turn into darker territory, at the end of episode two, the shift is a welcome jolt of energy – and once it begins to grip, it doesn’t let go. Gaslit has taken its ample ingredients and turned them into a very good, very watchable drama that steadily finds its feet.",Arts/Television & radio,Gaslit review – a star-powered Watergate drama that grips and doesn’t let go,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/24/gaslit-review-a-star-powered-watergate-drama-that-grips-and-doesnt-let-go
4/24/2022,"At just after nine one Friday spring morning, Angela Hartnett’s basement kitchen in her beautiful, chaotic, Georgian terraced house near London’s Spitalfields Market is still blinking itself awake. Hartnett, in leggings and an old sweatshirt, has some coffee on the stove and a pile of croissants on the tiny kitchen table surrounded by mismatched chairs that have moved houses with her. The one worktop is piled with a jumble of pots and dishes and books and letters. Hartnett’s husband, Neil Borthwick, is wandering in and out in his cycling kit, moaning about the tube strike and getting ready to head to his job as chef at the upstairs restaurant at the French House in Soho. Hartnett is chatting to me and checking her emails, and they are both trying to keep their dog, Betty, in check. There’s an Aga, which they use for heating rather than cooking, and a temporary fridge in one corner, a replacement for a fancier one that broke down in the first lockdown, beside a back window that looks out to a high-walled garden full of shady greenery. Sometimes, Borthwick says, they think of extending down here – it feels pretty crowded with even the three of us – or at least adding another work surface, but you doubt this plan is particularly urgent. Having both spent all their working lives in far smarter kitchens than this – they met at Gordon Ramsay’s the Connaught, where Hartnett won a Michelin star and Borthwick was her brilliant junior – it’s now where they come together to relax. That means it’s also the hub of their tight community of neighbours – Hartnett has lived here for 20 years – and the principal setting for the new book, The Weekend Cook, which tells the story of that neighbourhood through shared recipes for Burns Night bashes, easy lunches, hangover breakfasts, late-night suppers, birthdays and impromptu street parties. Hartnett, who runs a group of wonderful restaurants – including Murano in Mayfair and three Cafe Muranos – is the most bluntly self-effacing of chefs. She has always modelled her hospitality on that of her Italian grandmother, who made sure there was an unpretentious hug of welcome for guests, and something simple and delicious to eat. The original idea for The Weekend Cook, Hartnett says, came from her friend Pat Llewellyn, the TV producer who discovered Jamie Oliver and the Two Fat Ladies, who moved in round the corner some years ago. Llewellyn, who sadly died in 2017, had wanted to meet the neighbours and Hartnett offered to throw a dinner party. A couple of hours before it was due to start Llewelyn came round to find no evidence of any preparation at all for the event. The kitchen was in its usual disarray. Hartnett had to reassure her that all would be fine, and so it proved. “Pat always said she learned from that evening that entertaining can be very easy: you know, a pudding that’s already done, a cold starter, and a load of sharing plates in the middle of the table…” She insisted Hartnett should write that secret down. Had it not been for lockdown, Hartnett says, she probably wouldn’t have got around to it, but even though she helped to run a charity food service for the nurses and doctors in 10 London ICUs, and set up a homemade pasta takeaway service, she did find the time to put the recipes together. Talking about the book, Hartnett and Borthwick keep up a constant banter in the kitchen, first learned when they catered private dinner parties together. “I always used to take Neil with me,” Hartnett recalls, “partly because he was good, but mainly because we never stopped laughing.” They became an item when Borthwick left the Connaught and went to work in the south of France at Michel Bras’ restaurant in Aveyron. Hartnett used to visit on weekends. Their relationship was strengthened when Hartnett supported Borthwick through a horrific bike accident a decade ago that left him in a coma for five days and required long-term recuperation after he had a plate inserted in his skull. They married four years ago, the same day as Harry and Megan, in Hawksmoor’s famous Christ Church at the end of their street, “mainly” Borthwick says, “because it was the only place where Angela had no excuse for being late”. They talk me through some of the disasters of their home cooking. “Trifle-gate” where “Neil couldn’t get the cream to set” or “the time Angela dropped an apple pie for 12 on the stairs”. And the triumphs? “For the last street party,” Hartnett says, “we cooked for hundreds of people and I did everything except this one aubergine dish that Neil did. And all day people were coming up to me and going, ‘Those aubergines were amazing!’ In the end I got fed up saying, ‘Neil did them.’ I just started telling people to fuck off.” Some people think you are allowed to put anything you want on a quiche. But I’m not so sure. It is actually quite hard to make a good quiche and one of the best I’ve ever eaten was made from a Simon Hopkinson recipe – it was just onions, onions and more onions and cream and cheese. This is an asparagus quiche, but you could use broccoli if asparagus isn’t in season. You could vary the cheese you use, but you do need a hard, firm cheese. So perhaps comté or gruyère, or even a hard blue. You could also add a bit of cumin. Use this egg to cream ratio and you have yourself the perfect quiche base upon which to carefully build other flavours without going crazy. Serves 6-8For the pastryplain flour 170g, plus extra for dustingsalt a pinchlard 50gunsalted butter 50gegg yolk 1iced water 2 tbsp For the fillingasparagus 2 bunches (about 800g), or 200g purple sprouting broccolisalted butter 15gbanana shallot 1garlic 1 cloveegg yolks 3egg 1double cream 200mlcheddar cheese 200g, gratedsea salt and freshly ground black peppercrisp green salad to serve (optional) First, make the pastry. Sift the flour into a large bowl and add the pinch of salt. Add the lard and butter and rub them in with your fingertips, until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Mix the egg yolk with the water and lightly whisk, then add to the flour mix and use the back of a knife to combine. Use your hands to bring the mixture together to a firm dough. Tip out the dough on to a lightly floured board or work surface and knead it gently. Cover or wrap it in clingfilm and rest it in the fridge for at least 20 minutes. While the pastry rests, prepare the vegetables for the filling. If you’re using asparagus, snap off the woody stems (feel along the stem until it bends) and blanch them in boiling salted water for about 2 minutes (depending upon the thickness of the asparagus), until just cooked. Drain well. If you’re using broccoli, trim the stems and blanch them in salted boiling water for 2 minutes, until just cooked, then drain well. Heat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6. Roll out the rested dough on a lightly floured board or work surface to a 25cm disc about the thickness of a £1 coin (about 3mm). Carefully use the pastry disc to line a 20cm, loose-bottomed fluted tart tin, pushing the pastry into the edges and grooves. Trim the excess to neaten. Chill the tart case in the fridge for 20 minutes. Prick the base of the chilled tart case all over with a fork, then line it with scrunched-up baking paper and pour in some baking beans (or use dried beans or uncooked rice, if you don’t have baking beans – you can reuse the beans, but don’t eat them). Blind bake the pastry case for 20 minutes, until lightly golden, then remove the paper and beans and return the case to the oven for a further 5 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly in the tin. Turn the oven down to 160C/gas mark 4. While the tart case is cooling a little, make the filling. In a pan add the butter and cook the shallot and garlic for about 10 minutes, until soft but not coloured. Transfer to a bowl and leave to cool, then add the egg yolks, egg, cream and cheese to the bowl. Give it all a good mix to break up the eggs and combine the ingredients, and season with salt and pepper. Line the base of the pastry case with broccoli or asparagus, then pour in the egg and cheese mixture. Bake the quiche for 25 minutes, until the filling is set to the touch and golden brown. Allow to cool slightly, then remove it from the tin to serve. I like to serve it slightly warm, with a crisp green salad on the side We made this most recently for our friend and neighbour Basil on his birthday, when we had about 14 people over to celebrate the great day. It’s full of my favourite things – capers, dijon mustard, anchovies, vinegar and herbs – and is served with perfectly blanched leeks and soft-boiled eggs. It’s wonderful. Serves 4baby leeks 2 bunches, or 2 large leekseggs 3dijon mustard 2 tspwhite wine vinegar 20mlextra virgin olive oil 60mllovage a handful, leaves picked and chopped (use tarragon if you can’t find lovage)chives a handful, choppedanchovies 2, drained and choppedcapers 1 tsp, drained and choppedsalt and freshly ground black pepper Top and tail the baby leeks and soak them in water to remove any grit. If you’re using large leeks, trim off the dark green tops and slice them into 2cm rounds. Bring a pan of salted water to the boil over a high heat. Add the leeks and boil for 5 minutes, until just tender. Remove using a slotted spoon and set aside. Leave the pan on the heat. Add the eggs and cook on a low boil for 6 minutes, until soft boiled. Drain the eggs and transfer them to a bowl of iced or very cold water to stop the cooking process. Set them aside until cooled. Meanwhile, combine the mustard, vinegar and olive oil in a large bowl. Peel the cooled eggs and roughly chop them. Add the chopped eggs to the dressing in the bowl and season well, especially with black pepper. Add the chopped herbs, anchovies and capers, and mix well. To serve, place the leeks on a serving plate and pour over the egg and mustard vinaigrette. I know I’m very fortunate to have great suppliers and great chef friends. Seafood guru Mitch Tonks often sends us crabs up from Devon, and sometimes we get them sent to our door from Portland Shellfish. It is just so delicious and a wonderful thing to enjoy with friends. This salad could be either a great starter or a fantastic main event with bowls of fries. This is not the classic crab salad with egg and parsley, but a sea-fresh crab salad with a lovely hit of lime. You could replace the baby gem with chicory or kohlrabi, or a mix of the three would be great. And homemade mayonnaise, of course. Serves 4white crab meat 400gice a large bowllimes juice of 1½baby gem lettuce 2, leaves separatedextra virgin olive oil 3 tbspbasil, mint and coriander a handful of each, leaves and tender stems picked and choppedsalt and freshly ground black pepper For the mayonnaiseegg yolk 1white wine vinegar 1 tbspdijon mustard ½ tspvegetable oil 300mlbrown crab meat 150glime ½ First, make the mayonnaise. Put the egg yolk, vinegar and mustard in a food processor and blitz lightly to combine. Little by little, add the oil through the feed tube, mixing continuously as you do so, until the mixture emulsifies to form a loose mayonnaise. Add the brown crab meat and blitz the mixture together. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and add a good squeeze of lime juice. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and set aside. Sit the white crab meat on a plate set into the bowl of ice and gradually pick through it to make sure there are no pieces of shell. Season with salt and pepper and a touch of lime juice. Mix the salad leaves with the olive oil and remaining lime juice, then spread them across a large serving dish. Add the crab meat, dotting it all over the salad leaves. Sprinkle over the herbs and serve with the mayonnaise on the side. This is a recipe inspired by Valentine Warner, a very good chef and food writer. It’s my go-to way of making pork belly. I probably add a bit more garlic to mine, along with thyme sometimes. It’s just such a good and simple way to add great flavour. Pork belly is a pleasingly cheap cut of meat and wonderfully easy to cook; you just need to get your oven temperatures right. Serves 4rosemary sprigs 3, leaves picked and finely choppedunwaxed lemons finely grated zest of 2fennel seeds 1 tbspgarlic 4 cloves, peeled and crushedgroundnut oil 2 tbsppork belly 1.5kg, skin onsea salt and freshly ground black pepper Heat the oven to 200C fan/gas mark 7. Put the rosemary, lemon zest, fennel seeds and garlic in a mortar and grind them with a pestle to a good paste. Stir in the oil and season with salt and pepper, then set aside. Pat the pork belly dry with kitchen paper, then with a sharp knife, score across the narrow width of the belly at 2cm intervals, taking care to score through the skin and fat, but not into the meat. Rub the rosemary and lemon marinade all over the scored skin. Pour 1cm depth of water into a roasting tray, place a rack in the tray and the pork belly on top. Roast in the oven until the skin starts to bubble and crackle, about 30 minutes. Then reduce the heat to 140C fan/gas mark 2-3 and cook for a further 1 hour, until the meat is tender to the point of a knife. If the pork needs crisping up, increase the oven to 220C fan/gas mark 9 and roast for a final 15 minutes, until it’s good and crisp. Leave the pork to rest for 10-15 minutes, then slice and serve. I like to serve it on a bed of leaves for some freshness. We host Burn’s Night suppers at home, and what can beat a classic Scottish soup. The traditional base is smoked haddock, but another smoked fish would work just as well. I love making this soup – it’s so delicious and easy to make, and so hard to get wrong. Just be sure that you use good smoked haddock. Serves 4-6undyed smoked haddock 500g, skin onbay leaf 1unsalted butter 15gonion 1, peeled and finely choppedleek 1, sliced lengthways, then sliced thinly into half-moonspotatoes 2, peeled and cut into 1cm dicewhole milk 400mlchives 1 tbsp, choppedflat-leaf parsley a small handful, leaves and stems, choppedsea salt and white pepper Put the haddock and bay leaf in a pan and cover with 300ml of cold water. Season with white pepper and bring the liquid to the boil over a high heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer and poach the haddock for 5 minutes, until just cooked through, then remove the pan from the heat. Remove the haddock from the poaching liquid and transfer it to a plate. You should be able to easily remove the haddock flesh from the skin. Flake the flesh into pieces and leave it to cool (discard the skin). Pour the poaching liquid into a measuring jug and set aside. Melt the butter in another pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and sweat for 3 minutes, then add the leek and season. Sweat for a further 2-3 minutes to soften the leek, then add the diced potato and a touch more salt. Add the reserved poaching liquid. Lower the heat, cover the pan with a lid and cook the vegetables for 10 minutes, until the potatoes are soft but not mushy. Remove a quarter of the potato and leek mixture from the pan and leave it to one side. Add half the flaked haddock and the milk to the pan and heat through. Remove the pan from the heat and, using a hand-held stick blender or by pouring the soup into a food processor or blender, blitz until smooth. To serve, return the soup to a gentle heat until hot. Divide the reserved potato and leek mixture and the remaining flaked haddock between the bowls and pour over equal amounts of the soup. Finish with the chopped chives and parsley, and serve immediately. My Uncle Ren has always loved this dessert, so when I was making it for the photography shoot for this book, I called him up and asked him over. It was during lockdown (when we could meet outside), so he didn’t come near us, but just enjoyed it quietly in the garden, packed the rest into a container and left for his home, very happy and full. This is a bit of a showstopper; the meringue quenelles, the caramel and the custard make it a great dessert to impress. Serves 8For the creme anglaisewhole milk 750mlvanilla pod 1, split lengthways and seeds scraped outegg yolks 8caster sugar 200g For the poaching liquorwhole milk 500mlcaster sugar 1 tbsp For the meringueegg whites 8caster sugar 200g For the caramelcaster sugar 100g First, make the creme anglaise. Pour the milk into a saucepan and add the vanilla pod. Place it over a medium heat and leave it to heat up, so that the milk infuses with vanilla, until the milk is just below boiling point (look for a few bubbles around the edges). Meanwhile, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar in a mixing bowl until pale. Pour a touch of the hot milk mixture on to the eggs and sugar, and whisk rapidly until smooth. Pour the egg mixture into the pan with the rest of the milk. Stir continuously over a medium heat for 4-5 minutes, or until the mixture has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon. Strain the mixture through a sieve into a bowl, cover the surface with a piece of baking paper to stop a skin forming and leave the creme anglaise to cool (this is quickest set into a bowl of ice). Once cool, transfer the creme anglaise to the fridge until needed. Make the poaching liquor. Combine the milk, sugar and 250ml of water in a wide pan that’s deep enough to accommodate 3-4 meringue quenelles at a time. Place it over a low heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Meanwhile, make the meringue. Tip the egg whites into a large bowl and, using an electric hand whisk, whisk them until they form stiff peaks (but don’t let them go dry). Add 1 tablespoon of the sugar, and continue to whisk until the mixture comes back to stiff peaks. Keep adding the sugar, a tablespoon at a time, whisking between each addition until you’ve added all of it and you have a thick, glossy meringue. Using a serving spoon dipped in cold water, shape 12-16 (depending on the size of your spoon) quenelles (oval shapes with pointed ends) of the meringue and gently poach them in the milk mixture about 3-4 at a time. You need to leave room to be able to flip them over. Cook the quenelles for 4 minutes each side, making sure the liquid doesn’t boil, otherwise the meringues will puff and then collapse. As each meringue is cooked, remove it from the poaching liquid with a slotted spoon and place it on a large tray lined with baking paper to cool. Make the caramel. Tip the sugar into a clean pan and add 2 teaspoons of water. Melt the sugar over a low heat, brushing down the sides of the pan with a pastry brush from time to time, until the sugar turns a dark copper colour. Do not stir! Remove the caramel immediately from the heat to stop it from burning. Pour the caramel over the meringues and leave until set. To serve, make a generous pool of creme anglaise on each plate and top it with a meringue. From The Weekend Cook by Angela Hartnett (Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, £26).

4/24/2022,"No sooner has Afrobeats achieved global domination than spin-offs are in hot pursuit. Leap forward alté, a Nigerian movement that is apparently an alternative take on the mainstream fusions of West African roots music and R&B. Listening to the debut album by Bo, a British Nigerian who has been called a founder of this scene, it’s not exactly the experimental shift suggested, but it does feel less flashy and more mellow than its predecessors, despite features from some of Afrobeats’ biggest names: Davido, Tiwa Savage, Wizkid and Mr Eazi. Irrespective of genre, though, Gbagada Express is a sensual celebration of the diaspora that avoids the posturing of the chart-toppers and unites Nigeria, where Boj lives, with the UK, where he spent his school years. It’s often romantic, sexy and pulses with silk-soft subtlety – even in its trap song Get Out the Way, with Ghanaians Kofi Jamar and Joey B: heavy on sweet licks of slowed-down highlife guitar and, like South Africa’s amapiano genre, saxophone. Action Boyz is the opposite of its title, an almost ambient backdrop for Boj and Londoner Obongjayar’s tag-team about avoiding drama. In a move that still feels unique, the album’s strongest songs, In a Loop and Culture, are led by women (Moliy and Mellissa, and English rapper Enny).",Arts/Music,Boj: Gbagada Express review – a sensual Afrobeats celebration,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/24/boj-gbagada-express-review
4/24/2022,"It’s the most momentous biennale in living memory. I have never seen anything like it. This has nothing to do with the war, of which more later, though the Russian pavilion is closed and the borscht-coloured super-yachts all duly banished. Nor is it to do with the year-long delay caused by a pandemic that has no visible reflection whatsoever in the many thousands of works of art; nor is it even to do with the art itself. Rather, it is an epochal shift in attitudes. For the very first time, there are many more women than men, everywhere from the Giardini to the Arsenale and specifically in the main group exhibition that takes place in both. A whole cast who have been waiting in the wings for far too long are now playing front of stage. The 59th edition will go down in history as the women’s biennale. Already, the wildfire hit is Algerian-born artist Zineb Sedira in the French pavilion in the Giardini. Her show is a living enchantment. You enter straight into a seductive performance: a couple in evening dress sashaying to a swooning accordion in a Parisian bar that looks like a period film set. As indeed it is, along with the other walk-in sets around it – living rooms in 50s Algiers, 60s Paris and 80s London – all of which reappear on the screen of an old-fashioned arthouse cinema at the back of the pavilion. Here, Sedira is showing a film that weaves her family story into postcolonial history using the medium of cinema itself in the most captivating ways. You seem to be watching a clip from Gillo Pontecorvo’s 1966 black-and-white masterpiece The Battle of Algiers, for instance, except that the scene is mysteriously in colour: is this a living actor playing the role now? Whose film is which? A hand reaches into a scene and rearranges the room before your very eyes. Sedira herself appears, somehow actually there among Algerians arriving in 50s France, before she was even born, along with friends and family. She uses the seamless flow of film to question what is real and what is fiction, in history as in cinema. And it all dances along with such elegance and complexity, like Sedira herself, still shimmying against the final credits. One of her characters is none other than Sonia Boyce, the first black woman to represent Britain in the pavilion next door. Her work is even more collaborative, an enthralling female polyphony involving five singers, including the wondrous Tanita Tikaram and Jacqui Dankworth, feeling their way through a musical improvisation on separate screens. They cannot see each other, as we can, and yet their voices twine, adjust, attune to each other no matter how distinct. Running all the way from blues to folk, pop and jazz, humming and hymning, low and guttural, high and tremulous, they somehow head in the same direction. Boyce’s golden 3D sculptures become seats for listeners and plinths for a trove of discount albums by black female artists from Shirley Bassey to Beverley Knight onwards. The whole installation is like a jam session for the dream bands of black history. Like Boyce, Simone Leigh is the first black woman to represent her country in the US pavilion, which she has thatched to look like a traditional west African building. A female figure with a concave disc for a head towers over the forecourt: 24ft of black bronze. Leigh’s outsize sculptures make their point in black and white – a white woman in a porcelain crinoline, easily shattered; a black slave stooping over the washing, cast in enduring bronze. The best of her works, such as the monumental bell-shaped figure titled Brick House, stonewall the viewer with their sheer material force. This year’s big group show, The Milk of Dreams, curated by Cecilia Alemani, takes its title from a fairytale by the British-born Leonora Carrington, who is at the heart of an intensely intimate and eerie mini-survey of female surrealists to rival the huge surrealism blockbuster at the Peggy Guggenheim Foundation in Dorsoduro. There are “capsules” such as this throughout, some historic and even scholarly – from outsider art to cyborgs and mannequins – and much of the work, in this context, seems like late-flowering surrealism. Of the 213 artists, only 21 are men, which represents a complete reversal. More striking still is the novelty of walking through half a mile of art with scarcely a single male body in sight. The triumph, by general consent, is a magnificent presentation of paintings and stuffed figures by Paula Rego, their climax an altarpiece of old cabinets filled with women from literature and folklore who have fallen from grace. Some are grown up but still wearing their Foundling hospital uniforms, one clutching a foundling of her own. Society will never let them be free of their past. Stitching, weaving, knotting, tapestry – threads of all sorts run through this biennale, from the immensely delicate hanging gardens of the venerable Chilean artist Cecilia Vicuña to the dazzling op-art carpets of a resurgent Kosovo in its pavilion. Most stupendous is the colossal frieze running all the way round the Polish pavilion (including trompe l’oeil pillars) made entirely in appliqué by the young Romani-Polish artist Małgorzata Mirga-Tas with her three co-workers. Based on Renaissance frescoes in Ferrara, this takes the form of a three-tier narrative: the history of Poland running round the top, above a zodiac cycle of golden sheep and twinkling crabs, complete with images of Polish heroines; below them a sequence of everyday tableaux: women meeting, singing, drinking coffee, out in the fields gathering potatoes (the plastic baskets ingeniously conceived), from birth to old age and death. It is a vision of generosity and humour – characters wittily depicted in the very fabrics they might wear in life – requiring great aesthetic dexterity to convey everything from gently falling leaves to deep sorrow in fragments of cloth. Only consider that four Polish women created all this from scratch in five short months while Germany came up with nothing, literally – the floor up, the brickwork exposed, the pavilion empty while yet another artist “rediscovers” its past. It is almost impossible to ignore the geopolitical analogy. Of course, the pavilions were commissioned before the war, art is not a tool and so forth. But the spectacle in Venice is of Ukraine valiantly fending for itself. The artists and curator of the Russian pavilion resigned at the war’s outset, so that the biennale never had to make the moral decision to close it (one of its contracted “producers”, not incidentally, is Sergei Lavrov’s daughter). But speculation about the value of soft diplomacy – or Russian art money – doesn’t begin to explain the timidity of institutional response. The biennale eventually offered Ukraine a small lawn in the Giardini as a temporary pavilion two weeks ago, where its artists have raised a monument of sandbags, and art will be spontaneously produced until November. But where is the massive banner that ought to be visible from St Mark’s Square to the Lido? I’ve seen more Ukrainian flags in my corner of south London. The official pavilion is no more than a wall between Kosovo and Turkey in the Arsenale. But even in such cramped conditions, Pavlo Makov’s “fountain” of 78 bronze funnels, through which water gradually dwindles to meagre drips, has a profound and melancholy beauty. It was originally conceived in 1995, but nobody looking at it now could fail to think of Ukrainians dying of dehydration in Mariupol. This Is Ukraine: Defending Our Freedom is a collateral event, offsite in Cannaregio, backed by the Ukrainian oligarch Victor Pinchuk. Stationed at intervals through the Renaissance building are Lesia Khomenko’s larger-than-life paintings of civilians in ordinary clothes holding a gun in one hand and saluting with the other. Max Is in the Army, 2022, is the title of the series. Max, an artist too, is Khomenko’s husband. There is strength and consolation everywhere, if you look: in Malta’s marvellous raindrops of fire lightening the darkness in tribute to Caravaggio, in the inaugural Cameroonian pavilion with its photographs of women bursting from monochrome into full colour, in the hilarious New Zealand pavilion, where a Polynesian artist sends up Gauguin in a TV talkshow. Above all in Francis Alÿs’s glorious films in the Belgium pavilion. Children’s Games – an ongoing tribute to Bruegel, Alÿs’s compatriot – features snail racing, hide and seek, competitive skipping, elaborate matches involving nothing more than pebbles and holes in the sand. And all of it, all this rising joy, this gleeful improvisation, is played out in the ruins of poverty and war all over the world.

4/24/2022,"Maksym Kurochkin is a playwright. For almost three years, he and 20 other Ukrainian playwrights had been planning to build a new theatre in the heart of Old Kyiv. The group found a magnificent old structure that they were busy renovating in order to open the Playwrights’ theatre on 12 March. On 24 February, Maksym and his colleagues awoke to the horrific sound of bombs. 12 March came and went. Instead of planning a grand opening for a new theatre, Maksym is now examining military strategies to defeat the Russian invaders. Instead of a pen in his hand, he now carries a weapon. It is two months since the Russian army illegally crossed our borders. They have been failing ever since in their attempts to invade Ukraine. Part of the reason for their failure is that they were not expecting to meet such fierce and heroic resistance, both from our sophisticated military and from territorial defenders like Maksym who, when faced with the reality of the Russian invasion, decided to take up arms and fight. Many of these brave territorial defenders, including my own daughter, who immediately signed up once the war began, have never had any military training or been in any kind of conflict situation. Stories like that of the young couple who pushed their wedding day forward in order to join the territorial defence force, or the comedian who usually helps veterans get over their trauma but has decided to become a fighter himself, show you the unbreakable spirit of the Ukrainian people. Tragically, some of these defenders have fallen in battle. Others have been beaten and killed in cities such as Bucha, Kharkiv and Mariupol. We will not know how many of our citizens have died until we open the mass graves and clear the rubble of our razed cities. As shocking as these stories are to hear, this is exactly what we should expect from the savage Russian army led by the dictator Vladimir Putin. My own history with Putin goes back to 2000, when we were both prime ministers of our respective countries. It was only when I ran to be president of Ukraine in 2004 that he actively campaigned against me. The extreme lengths he was willing to go to in order to get what he wanted became clear. I could not allow this to deter me; after I won, I realised that I needed to try to keep a workable relationship with him as the leader of our neighbour in the east. But the Putin I dealt with then no longer exists. He has since become a completely isolated and brutal despot who cannot stand any opposition. One of the greatest weapons we now have against Putin is international solidarity and support. This is something that really bothers him. I know that, while news about our war made headlines all over the world and dominated the global conversation for several weeks, interest in stories of our territorial defenders is starting to wane. Fatigue towards the horrors of war is sadly common; we saw this with Syria, Yemen and our own Donbas. But those of us in Ukraine cannot afford to feel fatigued, or else we risk losing sight of victory. Our strength is now more important than ever. Although various Russian retreats are taking place, we hear stories that Russian troops are regrouping and planning to continue their attack. It is now that we must resolve to win this war. We cannot do this without external support. This war is a defining moment, not just in Ukrainian history, but in defence of democracy. This is not just a regional conflict between Ukraine and Russia but a fight against tyranny and imperialism. Our army continues to need weapons and military assistance from all our allies. And we need monetary assistance to help us plug the holes that this war is blowing in our previously strong economy. Our leadership is not only at the forefront of the war with Russia, but is also fighting behind battle lines – in the safety of international offices and institutions – to secure the support from allies that we need in order to restore peace and freedom to Ukraine. At the same time, we have an army of volunteers who must keep supplying our territorial defenders with the protective equipment they need in order to keep fighting on the frontlines. Thankfully, civil society organisations such as the Ukrainian World Congress have worked tirelessly to ensure a steady stream of non-lethal supplies to our defenders. They have also mounted a mammoth effort to advocate for our allies to send the weapons we desperately need, and impose the economic blockades and sanctions necessary to defeat Russian aggression. Our defenders will keep fighting until we finally achieve victory, and our supporters will keep doing everything they can to help them. I strongly believe that victory for Ukraine is inevitable. When ordinary Ukrainians give everything up to fight for their freedom and dignity, victory is the only option. I cannot wait for the day when this war is finally over and Maksym and his colleagues will be able to open their theatre and stage new plays written by brave and defiant playwrights who will focus not on propaganda, but on their own voices and ideas. Today, we fight for freedom. Tomorrow, we will watch the plays of our authors who won this freedom, defining what it means to be Ukrainian.

4/24/2022,"Whatever you make of discussing musicians’ concert dress choices, it takes an unusual level of fame before a singer’s jewellery gets its own credit in the programme book. But few living performers can claim to have sung at the Super Bowl, Buckingham Palace and a Nobel peace prize ceremony as well as the world’s major opera houses – never mind four Grammy wins, an indie-rock album and a Tony award-nominated Broadway appearance. US-born soprano Renée Fleming has done it all and more, becoming that rare phenomenon: the classical superstar. No wonder her appearance with the London Philharmonic Orchestra was an exercise in delayed gratification. Billed as a “gala evening” with the singer, the programme drip-fed Fleming to the packed auditorium, each half opening with the LPO alone. Various audience members crept into their seats not only partway into the first half but also midway through the second. It was their loss. Under Enrique Mazzola – neat, efficient and absolutely in control – the LPO sparkled, the ensemble taut and orchestral blend luxurious. Dvořák’s Othello Overture Op 93 doesn’t get out much these days; its appearance was the most obvious symptom of a short, strange programme built backwards around Fleming’s choices. It’s not a subtle piece but Mazzola went for the details – minute pianissimos and acres of space in Dvořák’s endless dotted rhythms and triplets. The ballet music from Verdi’s Otello was a virtuosic balancing act, Mazzola’s deliberate, delicate poise increasing the pay-off of the sequence’s explosive climaxes. Opening the second half, the string-sextet introduction of Strauss’s Capriccio was exceptionally intimate, its lines dancing in slow motion as the rest of the heavyweight orchestra looked on. And then there was Fleming, welcomed by ecstatic shouts then a silence so still you could hear the air conditioning. The Willow Song and Ave Maria from Verdi’s Otello poured out with astonishing ease, every “Salce!” (“Willow”) of Desdemona’s lament differently coloured and differently painful. In the final scene of Strauss’s Capriccio, Fleming floated on a velvet cushion of orchestral sound, the sheer intimacy of her performance unforgettable even if the top notes were occasionally harsh and her gestures mannered. Her single encore – Strauss’s song “Morgen” – was gorgeous: intensely, quietly peaceful.",Arts/Music,Renée Fleming/LPO review – superstar soprano is unforgettable ,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/24/renee-fleming-lpo-review-enrique-mazzola-royal-festival-hall
4/24/2022,"From a former ice factory becoming a shiny home for offices and shops, to a Victorian bus works getting a new lease of life as a flexible workspace, across the country, buildings are being retrofitted and repurposed for the future. It stands in stark contrast to what seemed like the commercial property industry’s motto in recent years: knock it all down and start again. For several decades, buildings such as office blocksweren’t designed or built with longevity in mind. When parts and equipment such as lifts and windows wore out, landlords often opted for demolition over refurbishment. But, against the backdrop of the UK’s race to reach net zero by 2050, the climate crisis has forced all sectors of the economy to consider their emissions, prompting property owners and developers to look again at the impact of construction. While buildings have become much more energy efficient to run, huge amounts of energy are required – and therefore large amounts of carbon - emitted during the manufacture of components as well as in the construction. These emissions, occurring before a building is even in use, create what is known as “embodied carbon”. “Twenty years ago if you looked at the overall carbon impact of a building, then 80% of it might have come from how you use it,” said Chris Cummings, director at Savills Earth, the estate agent’s sustainability team. “With a brand new glass and steel building in London now, 95% to 98% of the building’s impact will be in the materials, because it’s going to be lean and be using green energy, and the grid is decarbonising.” The prize on offer for decarbonising the entire life cycle of a building is significant. The World Green Building Council calculates that construction, together with the energy required to heat, cool and power buildings, accounts for almost 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Tenants are increasingly demanding more efficient buildings too, and their landlords are trying to deliver this by giving old structures a new lease of life. Comprising two Victorian warehouses, a former bus factory in London’s Islington, known as the Busworks, was bought for £45m last year by flexible office provider Workspace, which is turning the history-rich building into modern offices. “Going back 30 years, you built a HQ building with the view that someone would probably knock it down and build it again in 25-30 years,” said Cummings. He believes developers are once again planning on buildings with a long life, or even several lives: “Going back further it was: ‘we need something which lasts 100 years’, and I think it’s coming back that now.” In central Birmingham, close to the canal and some of the city’s buzzing bars and restaurants, one of these major refits is taking place. 10 Brindleyplace, formerly offices of NatWest (previously the Royal Bank of Scotland) and apartments, has been stripped back and is covered by scaffolding and plastic sheeting. Two buildings are becoming one, and only the frame, foundations and basement have been retained, which will save some embodied carbon. “The life expectancy for plant [equipment and fittings] is 20 years,” said Nick White, asset manager at CBRE Global Investors, which is behind the £40m transformation. “The lifts, air con, mechanical and electrical systems were at the end of life and were breaking down.” Rather than just replacing worn-out equipment, the building is being completely reconfigured inside and out, transformed into a modern workspace. About 212,000 sq ft (19,695 square metres) of open office space is being created, larger windows installed, and six roof terraces built for outdoor working and meetings. The works were planned and under way before Covid hit, but the developersbelieve the building is primed for the post-pandemic world of work,equipped with a gym, bike racks and showers. “Offices have got to fundamentally work harder,” said Theo Holmes, director in CBRE’s office agency team. “There is a flight to quality, and creating an environment for getting more out of staff. The building has to operate to meet changing needs.” Due to be ready by the time Birmingham hosts the Commonwealth Games in July, the retrofitted building will be more efficient than before, powered by green energy including 840 sq ft of solar panels.Such energy transformations aren’t limited to the newer buildings. Historic sites, and even those with protected status, are also getting in on the act. Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster’s property company, which can trace its links with London property back to 1677, is retrofitting its London portfolio, including 500 Grade I- and II-listed buildings. In an attempt to cut its carbon emissions, the company’s UK property arm has pledged to invest £90m by 2030 in retrofitting and reducing the operational emissions of its buildings. A former ice factory, near the capital’s Victoria station, is one of these projects. Built in 1830, it was most recently a car garage, but is being turned into a five-storey building for offices, shops and a rooftop restaurant. Grosvenor Property UK’s chief executive, James Raynor, brought forward the company’s target date for reaching carbon neutrality by five years to 2030 last October. Along with retrofitting, this will be achieved by carbon offsetting, and increasing the company’s use of renewable energy. “Why wait until 2030 to offset?” said Raynor. “We know the challenges that we face, and the climate crisis is there, flashing big warning lights.” Grosvenor’s first net zero carbon office development is also under way: a 1980s office block at Holbein Gardens, close to Sloane Square, is being turned into a modern workspace. Raynor says tenants are demanding more efficient buildings and understand that these won’t necessarily be the newest structures. “At the top end of the office market, we are starting to see that people will walk away from buildings that don’t offer great environmental credentials,” he said. “It’s in the interest of developers, ourselves and others, to make sure that everything has the best credentials possible, otherwise they will stay empty which isn’t really the point.” Alongside property companies, local authorities are increasingly looking to retrofitting to help them meet their emissions targets. Not all are following this path. Marks & Spencer has recently faced criticism over its plans to demolish its 90-year old flagship store close to Marble Arch in London. Following environmental concerns, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, reviewed the plans, but gave Westminster council the green light to approve the scheme, allowing the retailer to knock down the art deco building. Marks & Spencer said the site could not be developed further. It will be replaced with a 10-storey structure containing a smaller store, as well as offices and a gym. It has been estimated that the construction will create so much carbon dioxide that 2.4m trees would need to be planted to offset it.",News/Business,Drive for net zero fuels UK boom in retrofitting buildings for new use,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/24/drive-for-net-zero-fuels-uk-boom-in-retrofitting-buildings-for-new-use
4/24/2022,"Sir Ray Tindle, who has died aged 95, was the buoyantly enthusiastic rescuer of more than 200 local newspapers in the UK and a philanthropist of imagination and charm. He harnessed his lifelong energy to a model of ultra-local news, trim private ownership and an absolute ban on borrowing money – in the process defying Jeremiahs in the industry for more than 60 years. He loved the job, from his first encounter with its novelty and bustle as a schoolboy evacuee to his death while still company president of his own Tindle Group, although with the executive succession passed to his son, Owen in 2017. Unusually for a press baron, as he may be literally but misleadingly described, he was much liked. Tindle realised his principal ambition by saving so many sources of news but never gave up on another which he described only four years ago to the industry’s own newspaper, Press Gazette. “If I could have my way I’d have a new newspaper for every street,” he said. “That’s not impossible. If you give a page to every street and change the position of the page each week, you could have a front page for every street. I think we’re nearly there – we’ve come close.” The model went back to his first publication, cranked out on a duplicator on a troopship taking the Devonshire Regiment to the far east in 1944. He learned how many people had stories to tell and how much they wanted reminders of their home county. Demobbed in 1947 with the rank of captain, he wrote 200 job applications before landing what he called a “dogsbody” job at the Croydon Times, and spent 13 years there learning the trade through and through. He kept hold of his demob money for all that time, and in 1960 paid £250 to buy the Tooting and Balham Gazette, which had a venerable past but was on its knees. His formula raised sales from 700 to 3,500 in a year, then he swapped it for three stuttering titles in west London, which he also turned around. His favourite of the long line of subsequent successes was the Tenby Observer in south west Wales, whose central role in the passing of the 1908 Local Authorities (Admission of Press to Meetings) Act he knew from school. Learning of its bankruptcy two days before closure, he rang the receiver, had an offer accepted, drove to Tenby and asked the staff if they would have another shot on his terms. “A cat must not have kittens in Tenby unless it’s covered by the Observer,” he instructed. To his delight, their front page two days later included the headline “Two clothes brushes stolen from Tenby caravan.” Sales rose accordingly and the paper is now in its 170th year. Such journalism seldom wins awards but Tindle believed absolutely in its importance to the democracy for which he had fought. His papers’ shared motto was Winston Churchill’s “We will never surrender”, which he had heard broadcast live, but he could as well have used Oliver Cromwell’s description of his preference for an ordinary soldier “that knows what he fights for, and loves what he knows”. Detailed and reliable community news was the stuff of that. Tindle was born in Streatham, south London, where his father, John, an engineer, took him to watch the annual London to Brighton veteran car run, which he was later to help preserve with 30 years of sponsorship. Vintage cars became a passion, and he drove his 1904 Speedwell Dogcart in the run for more than half a century. His mother, Maud (nee Bilney), rescued him when their house roof fell in during a wartime air raid and he was evacuated from London to Paignton in Devon, where he went to Torquay boys’ grammar school. More significantly for his future career, he was introduced to journalism by his host family’s neighbour, who was advertisement director of the Torbay Herald and Express. After service in the far east he married his childhood sweetheart, Beryl Ellis, in 1949. She became in his words his “rock”, and matched his zest for community work in Farnham, Surrey, where they settled down. She also worked as a teacher of adults with learning difficulties and on retirement ran a secondhand shop that supported a different charity every time it raised £1,000, only calling it a day at the age of 94. Tindle’s work “family” was almost as close, with two lieutenants at his side in a fashion similar to Alan Sugar’s on The Apprentice: Wendy Craig, who joined as his PA in 1985, specialised in finance, and Brian Doel, former head of training at the Mirror’s west country operation, oversaw editorial. Group editors were largely left alone unless sales or advertising dipped for too long. Then they were invited to Farnham for coffee. The group aimed for proportionate profits, rather than gold dust, and Tindle enjoyed teasing critics of his tight control as sole shareholder by asking what was wrong with one man, one vote. But there were issues, notably when his strong services loyalty led him to ask editors not to report anti-war events at the start of the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The ban was lifted within weeks and Tindle’s open style and willingness to argue helped. It had been the same when he worked through a compositors’ strike at the Croydon Times in 1950, telling the printers’ leader Frank Stagg: “We’re only here because otherwise the paper will close and we’ll all lose our jobs.” Stagg replied: “I know that. I gather you’re on my linotype machine and I wanted to tell you that the lower-case ‘t’ gets stuck.” Tindle’s formula was almost always applied to weekly papers but he knew the wider media, diversified carefully into radio and online, and also drew the Guardian’s attention to Autotrader magazine, which became an important Guardian Media Group asset. For 18 years he was on the board of the Guardian, whose former editor Peter Preston described him as a man of “gentle habits and roseate presence”. Tindle, who was knighted in 1994, played a full part in the media industry and its professional bodies and was quietly proud of 10 enterprise centres he set up to give rent-free start-up space to businesses during the 1980s recession. He knew about perseverance; his voicebox was removed to stem throat cancer in the mid-90s and he learned to speak again without it. He is survived by his wife and son, and a granddaughter, Maisy.

4/24/2022,"A Fabergé egg with a tiny diamond clasp in the shape of a snowflake and a miniature frog carved from Siberian nephrite jade are among more than 100 treasures on show in a exhibition at Polesden Lacey, the home of the Edwardian society hostess Dame Margaret Greville. The objects – many of them gifts to Greville from royalty, aristocracy and heads of state – include a delicately carved jasper owl on a perch that is attributed to Fabergé for the first time. Four other objects are also confirmed as creations of the master craftsman. They will be displayed along with rare ceramics and silverware, and masterpieces by some of the world’s greatest artists, in Treasured Possessions: Riches of Polesden Lacey, which opens on Monday. Greville, the daughter of the fabulously wealthy brewing tycoon William McEwan, bought Polesden Lacey in Surrey, now a National Trust property, with her aristocratic husband Ronnie in 1907 as a place where the couple could host lavish weekend house parties. Her parties were famous for guest lists that included King Edward VII and Queen Mary, Winston Churchill and other leading politicians, writers and cultural figures, European royalty and American socialites. Agog to inspect Greville’s latest acquisitions, they drank Bollinger in the imposing hall of the house, featuring a huge reredos reclaimed from a London church and tapestries from the 16th and 17th centuries, before their hostess descended the grand staircase to greet them. Greville was a collector, but many of the treasures on display were gifts. “It was a form of Edwardian social currency – the giving of gifts kept the social dynamics well oiled,” said Richard Ashbourne, an assistant curator of the exhibition. The Fabergé frog was a present from Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich, a grandson of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia. Queen Mary brought an ivory chess set and a blue enamel and gold circular box when visiting with Edward VII. The House of Fabergé was in its heyday, with its luxury creations desired by the world’s elite. Greville was a regular customer at Fabergé’s London shop, its first outside Russia, with ledgers showing she bought 31 items over several years. John Benjamin, the Antiques Roadshow expert who advises the National Trust on Fabergé, said: “Mrs Greville had ample means and opportunity to acquire beautiful objets de fantaisie, notable for their virtuosity, wit and effortless charm.” The highlights of the exhibition include a ruby and diamond brooch in the shape of an “E” worn by Greville at the coronation of Edward VII, a pair of pottery horse heads from early imperial China, and Staffordshire porcelain tulips. Among the paintings is The Paterson Children, a portrait by Sir Henry Raeburn bought by Greville in 1918 for £23,000 – the most expensive painting she acquired. Greville had no children, and on her death in 1942 her jewellery was bequeathed to the Queen Mother, including the Greville tiara, now on long-term loan to the Duchess of Cornwall. She left Polesden Lacey to the National Trust. “Margaret Greville inherited a passion for collecting from her father. Her fashionable collection provided a suitably lavish backdrop to her famous parties at Polesden Lacey,” said Ashbourne. “Mrs Greville and her friends bought treasures for each other, including creations by Fabergé, to be displayed and discussed, or even regifted. Gift-giving was a key social ritual in Edwardian high society circles – as such, Mrs Greville’s collection was also a signifier of her intimacy and influence with the rich and powerful.” Treasured Possessions: Riches of Polesden Lacey runs until 30 October, and again next year from 1 March to 29 October.",News/UK news,A Fabergé egg and a jade frog: treasures of Polesden Lacey,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/24/faberge-egg-and-a-jade-frog-treasures-of-polesden-lacey

4/24/2022,"Britain risks being left behind in the increasingly intense battle for investment from overseas unless it can improve the level of skills on offer to foreign firms, according to a hard-hitting report. A taskforce headed by the former CBI director general John Cridland has warned that it is no longer enough to base the UK’s appeal on cheap labour, as other countries increasingly use well-trained workers as a magnet to attract companies. The report, by the Skills Taskforce for Global Britain, said countries that successfully brought in foreign direct investment (FDI) boasted workforces with a sophisticated range of skills to attract investors. The taskforce called on the Department for International Trade to adopt a similar approach for the UK. Cridland said: “For big inward investors, skills matter. If they can’t find them here they will expand in other countries. “In the past, the UK has had a good record in attracting inward investment, but it has been based on low labour costs rather than on skills. We are now at a tipping point. There is a real risk of the UK being overtaken by other countries where the offer to investors is based on skills.” The report found that almost half (46%) of foreign firms said they would move their operations abroad if they couldn’t get the skills they needed, compared with just over a fifth (22%) of domestic firms. In addition, three-fifths (61%) of foreign firms said they would expand overseas if they couldn’t get the skills they needed in the UK, compared with just a third (32%) of domestic firms. The report added that UK FDI was too concentrated in the economically dominant areas of London and the south-east, so creating higher skilled and better paid jobs was vital to the government’s levelling up agenda. In 2020, Boris Johnson announced a “radical shake-up” of education for over-18s, including a “lifetime skills guarantee”, under which every adult without A-levels would be funded to take a college course for “skills that are highly in demand”. Cridland said the government needed to appreciate the link between skills and attracting foreign investment. The education department was responsible for skills but not concerned with inward investment, he said, while the international trade department sought to attract inward investment but was not concerned with skills. The former CBI director general said that when potential inward investors were introduced to the principals of further education colleges in the UK, they were told what courses were currently on offer. “In places like Ohio, Singapore and the Republic of Ireland, inward investors are asked: ‘What do you need?’ They are getting ahead of the game.” Cridland said the link between skills and inward investment had not been looked at before and didn’t seem to be a major consideration when FDI policy was being developed. “At one level this is surprising. As director general of the CBI, I heard week after week from firms across the UK – both UK-owned and those with foreign parent companies – how a lack of skills was holding back their business from growing and innovating. “But I also know that skills has long been the ‘Cinderella’ of public policy, overlooked because it is complex and too few of the people who make public policy have personal experience of the skills systems in the UK.”",News/Education,"UK needs better skills to win foreign investment battle, finds report",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/24/uk-needs-better-skills-to-win-foreign-investment-battle-finds-report
