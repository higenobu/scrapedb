3/14/2022,"The Morrison government has slapped fresh sanctions on Russian oligarchs, including the prominent billionaire Roman Abramovich, who is the London-based owner of Millhouse Capital and the Chelsea Football Club. Australia on Monday designated 33 individuals, including the chief executive of Gazprom, Alexey Miller, and the chair of Bank Rossiya, Dmitri Lebedev. The move against Abramovich, one of the world’s richest men, brings Australia in line with the UK and the US. The latest move by Australia comes after a Russian strike on a military base close to the Polish border in the far-west of Ukraine. The weekend attack – one the deadliest of the war so far – killed at least 35 people and injured more than 130. The escalation prompted a warning from Nato. The base has been used by Nato to train Ukrainian military forces. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has appealed to western nations for weeks to impose a no-fly zone over his country. While a number of nations, including Australia, have dispatched lethal military support, allies are seeking not to engage Russia directly, fearing a conflagration in Europe. Canada, the EU, New Zealand, the US and the UK have imposed sanctions targeting the Russian president Vladimir Putin’s inner circle since the president ordered the invasion of Ukraine. Other individuals named by Australia on Monday include: the chair of Rostec and member of the Supreme Council of United Russia, Sergey Chemezov; the founder and largest shareholder of Alfa Group, Mikhail Fridman; the president of Transneft, Nikolai Tokarev; the chair of Sheremetyevo international airport, Alexander Ponomarenko; the chair of VEB, Igor Shuvalov; and the chief executive of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, Kirill Dmitriev.

Sullivan has warned China it will face consequences if it helps Moscow evade escalating sanctions triggered by the war. Over the weekend, Sullivan told NBC: “We have made it clear to not just Beijing but every country in the world that if they think that they can basically bail Russia out, they can give Russia a workaround to the sanctions that we’ve imposed, they should have another thing coming because we will ensure that neither China, nor anyone else, can compensate Russia for these losses.” The Australian sanctions cover a group of oligarchs close to Putin, and some spouses and children. The Morrison government argues many Russian oligarchs have either facilitated, or directly benefited from, the Kremlin’s military incursions into Ukraine since 2014. The government says more than 400 sanctions have been imposed since the invasion began.",News/Australia news,Roman Abramovich among Russian oligarchs targeted by new Morrison government sanctions,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/roman-abramovich-among-russian-oligarchs-targeted-by-new-morrison-government-sanctions
3/14/2022,"The New Zealander who unwittingly sparked an agonising global debate over whether there are more doors or wheels in the world has come to his own conclusion – “I’m firmly team wheels”. Auckland man Ryan Nixon, 37, was at home watching sport two Saturday nights ago when a friend posed the question to a group chat he shares with a bunch of mates. Unable to reach a consensus, he decided to create a poll for his fewer than 1,500 Twitter followers. “My mates and I are having the STUPIDEST debate … And I am here for it,” he wrote. “Do you think there are more doors or wheels in the world?” On a usual day, Nixon, who is a rugby referees manager, “is pretty stoked” to get up to 100 votes on a Twitter poll. After posting the conundrum he watched a few votes trickle in and went to bed. On Sunday morning, after a round of golf, he noticed the post had raced up to 14,000 votes, and then, when New Zealand entertainer Jemaine Clement retweeted it to his half-a-million followers, the poll “just exploded”. By Monday, he had switched off his notifications because it was “getting out of hand”. My mates and I are having the STUPIDEST debate...And I am here for it.Do you think there are more doors or wheels in the world? At the poll’s close, it had amassed 223,347 votes, just under 2,500 comments and more than 9,000 retweets, with 53.6% concluding there were more wheels in the world. But the debate did not stop there, with the poll spawning countless TikTok videos, social media posts and ongoing media commentary as people went round and round trying to get to the bottom of the answer, only to find themselves standing in front of a hypothetical locked door – ultimately, the question is unanswerable, or at least would take significant resources and time to come to any sort of reliable conclusion. So is this +1 for team doors or team wheels?? pic.twitter.com/OAwkwTDb8i Nixon said the question had been floating around the internet for a while, but “for whatever reason – good luck, good timing and good luck with some of the retweets – it just took off from there”. “To get a quarter of a million [votes] is just ridiculous, I can’t explain it.” However, Nixon has some theories on why the question has induced such a feverish response. “If you’re having a debate with your mates, it’s so easy just to jump on Google and win or lose the argument, but for this one there is no answer – it would take forever to try to solve it. “The beauty of it is people can pick a side and argue for or against … and some people do that pretty aggressively.” So this caught my eye on Tik Tok. 👀Are there more doors🚪or wheels 🎡? pic.twitter.com/rpVwTRiXMk It was interesting to him that people were firmly one or the other. Nixon himself had immediately jumped on the “door” bandwagon, but after engaging in some “critical thinking” and reading through numerous arguments for and against, he switched to team “wheel”. “People were pointing out office chairs and trolleys and wheels in your drawers and wheels on sliding doors and on toys. I’m firmly team wheels now.” Nixon said his brush with fame was surreal and fun, but that it would “peter out soon” and he could go back to living his normal life. Until then, he was happy he created some silly respite for people around the world. “With everything else that was going on with Covid, Russia and Ukraine, and petrol prices, providing people with a lighthearted distraction or entertainment was cool.”",News/World news,‘I can’t explain it’: the man behind the wheels-doors Twitter post that ‘exploded’ online,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/i-cant-explain-it-the-man-behind-the-wheels-doors-twitter-post-that-exploded-online
3/14/2022,"Russia’s defence ministry has admitted responsibility for a rocket attack on the International Centre for Peacekeeping and Security, a military base, near the Polish border on Sunday. The death toll from the attack rose to 35 people. British prime minister Boris Johnson called Russia’s actions barbaric and said it was a test of all of humanity. US secretary of state Antony Blinken condemned the attack, saying the brutality must stop. Ukraine president Zelenskiy again urged Nato to implement a no-fly zone. “If you don’t close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian rockets fall on your territory, on Nato territory,” he said. Russia has asked China for military equipment since the start of the invasion, the Financial Times reported. The request has sparked fear in the White House that Beijing may aid Russia and undermine the West’s efforts in Ukraine. China’s US embassy spokesperson said they hadn’t heard about that request and that “the current situation in Ukraine is indeed disconcerting”. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan is due to meet China’s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, in Rome on Monday. Ahead of the meeting, Sullivan warned that Beijing will “absolutely” face consequences if it helps Moscow evade sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine. Sullivan also said Russia would pay a “severe price” for a chemical weapons attack. Instagram was reportedly down in Russia after its owner Meta Platforms said last week it would allow social media users in Ukraine to post messages such as “Death to the Russian invaders”. An email message from the state communications regulator told people to move their photos and videos from Instagram before it was shut down, and encouraged them to switch to Russia’s own “competitive internet platforms”. The chief executive of controversial facial recognition company Clearview AI said the Ukraine defence ministry had started to use its services, according to Reuters. The ministry was given free access to Clearview AI – a controversial facial recognition software that scrapes images from social media and other platforms – to use during the war. Talks between Russia and Ukraine are due to resume via video link on Monday. The confirmation of the next round of talks come after both sides said they were making headway at the negotiations aimed at ending more than two weeks of fighting between the Russian and Ukrainian armies.",News/World news,Ukraine war: everything we know on day 19 of the Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/ukraine-war-everything-we-know-on-day-19-of-the-russian-invasion
