1/20/2022,"A Chinese woman who was trapped on a month-long date due to a COVID-19 lockdown in Shaanxi province announced engagement plans to her quarantine date.

The woman, Zhao Xiaoqing, aged 28, had arranged a one-day date with Zhao Fei (who is of the same age) from Xianyang, Shaanxi Province, but a day unexpectedly turned into a month-long live-in date when a sudden COVID-19 lockdown measure was put in place.

Xiaoqing has been reportedly trapped inside Fei’s home along with his parents since mid-December of last year. It was reportedly their second time meeting after having previously been set up on a blind date. According to the South China Morning Post, she was not interested in Fei when she first saw a picture of him, but she had found that their “souls are compatible” after living together for a few weeks.

“At first, it was embarrassing for me to live in another person’s home,” Xiaoqing said, according to the South China Morning Post. “But soon I found they are easy-going and I got used to life there.”

Fei’s parents had urged the two to get married after a week of the lockdown, but the couple plans to wait for at least six months before getting married, Taiwan News reported.

The Post also reported that Fei had won Xiaoquing’s heart with flowers and presents given to her parents and that Xiaoqing found him more handsome in person, as well as a “responsible” and “considerate” man.

""I livestream in his place to sell apples and he is there, no matter how late it is,” Xiaoqing said, according to Global Times. “It really touched me and we plan to get engaged after the lockdown is lifted, which will probably be by the Chinese New Year on February 1.""

“I very much treasure the love between us,” she added. “This is the biggest harvest for me in the year of 2021. I am thankful for this special karma.”

1/20/2022,"Juvenile Court Judge Donna Scott Davenport from Rutherford County, Tennessee announced she is retiring. Davenport faced criticism last year after reports she spearheaded policies for illegally arresting and detaining children. Her retirement announcement comes one day after state legislators proposed a resolution to remove her from the bench. A Tennessee juvenile court judge who received backlash for routinely arresting and jailing children has announced she plans to retire this year. Judge Donna Scott Davenport, Rutherford County's Juvenile Court Judge, said she does not plan to seek reelection for the position that she has held since 2000. ""After prayerful thought and talking with my family, I have decided not to run for re-election after serving more than twenty-two years on the bench,"" Davenport said in a statement. Her office did not respond to requests for comment. ""I will always look back at my time as Judge as one of the greatest honors of my life, and I am so proud of what this Court has accomplished in the last two decades and how it has positively affected the lives of young people and families in Rutherford County,"" she said. ""I wish my successor the best and hope that this job provides them the same fulfillment it has provided me over the years."" Davenport's term ends in September. Her retirement announcement comes just one day after state legislators in Tennessee issued a resolution to remove her from the bench. Thus far, two candidates have announced they are running to fill her position. Last October, an extensive report by ProPublica and Nashville Public Radio found that Davenport orchestrated a system to arrest and jail children, many of whom were Black. Davenport utilized a ""process"" that included an ""always arrest"" policy, in which children were arrested by police and taken to a juvenile detention center where a jailer – who was appointed by Davenport – used a ""filter system"" to decide which children to hold. The children later appear before Davenport in juvenile court. Jacob Somers, who told Insider Davenport threatened to lock him up until he was 18 if he did not ""straighten (his) shit,"" said the judge appeared to be ""retiring to avoid guilt."" Somers was one of nearly 1,500 plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against Rutherford County that was settled for $11 million. Kyle Mothershead, one of the attorneys in the class-action lawsuit, told Insider said hundreds of claims for settlement money were submitted to the claims administrator following the lawsuit. Plaintiffs who were illegally arrested may get $1,000, and those who were illegally detained may get about $4,800, he said. Mothershead also noted the ""filter system"" used by jailers to decide which children to detain is no longer in place at Rutherford County Juvenile Detention Center. A 2017 preliminary injunction on the system was made permanent as part of the settlement agreement for the lawsuit. ""The 'Always Arrest' policy is no longer in effect either. This was not the result of a court order, but rather the law enforcement agencies changing their juvenile arrest policies in response to our lawsuit,"" Mothershead said. Akira Lawrence, 22, told Insider she was arrested dozens of times between ages 11 to 17 and said she appeared many times before Davenport. She said none of the charges against her were for drugs or violence. ""We were treated like animals, and we were just kids,"" Lawrence said. ""I was treated like I murdered someone, and that was never the case. They acted like I was just horrible."" Lawrence said she was traumatized by her experience at Rutherford County Juvenile Detention Center and it was one of the reasons why she moved out of the county. ""I have PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) from my childhood there,"" she said. Lawrence said Davenport retiring means there is no accountability for how children like her were treated. ""There's no way that they should just let her retire,"" Lawrence said. ""How could you say that you helped us?"" Following initial reports of Davenport's practices while on the bench, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee called for a review of the judge. Such a review would be conducted by the Board of Judicial Conduct, which can file public reprimands on judges as well as file formal charges. Davenport received a public reprimand in 2016 after she referred to a parent as a ""sneaky snake"" in court and called his attorneys ""conniving."" Barbara Peck, the communications director for the board, previously told Insider that she cannot comment on whether there is an investigation into Davenport due to confidentiality. ""If an investigation leads to public disciplinary action, such as a public reprimand, the reprimand will be posted on the board's webpage. If formal charges are filed against a judge, that would likewise be made public."" In a comment to Insider, Peck said the board loses jurisdiction to reprimand or charge a judge if they retire. ""Once a judge retires or resigns, the Board of Judicial Conduct loses jurisdiction and cannot take any further action in a pending matter. Thus, it is not possible to formally charge a judge with an ethics violation or for discipline to be imposed once a judge leaves office. Sometimes, however, a resignation or retirement is the end result of an investigation or the form of discipline imposed,"" Peck said. For Lawrence, the news of Davenport retiring seemingly without consequences made her feel ""helpless."" She said that the judge's comments on how she ""positively affected the lives of young people"" were simply false. ""It's not positively. I'm about to cry. It hasn't really positively affected families at all,"" Lawrence said. ""I can't believe this is happening, and there's nothing I can do.""

1/20/2022,"FRANKFORT, Ky. — It is a recurring nightmare for many in the pandemic era — unintentionally having your computer unmuted during a remote work meeting and saying something extremely inappropriate or embarrassing. That nightmare became a reality for state Sen. Denise Harper Angel, D-Louisville, on Wednesday when she swore at her husband in an argument that was inadvertently shared with a Kentucky Senate committee on a livestream for all of the public to hear. ""You made me miss roll call… because I couldn't unmute, because you were f---ing cussing,"" Harper Angel was heard saying in the committee meeting, drawing suppressed laughs from the committee audience and the senator testifying for his bill. Budget address: 5 takeaways from Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear's 2022 budget address to the legislature After a voice is heard arguing with her in the background, Harper Angel sternly said ""shut up!"" — at which point there was no more audio from her feed and the meeting continued. In a statement tweeted later that afternoon, the five-term senator confirmed the voice heard was her, saying it was unfortunate ""a private moment between my husband and I was accidentally shared when I thought my computer was on mute."" ""All couples have disagreements,"" Harper Angel said. ""The stress of wearing many different hats, combined with an ongoing pandemic, manifested when I had trouble accessing zoom. This was a personal moment not meant for public broadcast, and I hope everyone will respect that."" The video clip garnered not just laughs on social media, but also sympathy from some who have feared succumbing to a muting error and sharing an embarrassing moment in a virtual work meeting. ""Zoom has invited all of us into each other’s homes,"" tweeted Louisville poet Hannah Drake. ""We are in a pandemic, many of us on edge, tempers can flare, and we just hope they aren’t caught live. I say this for Dems and Reps. We ALL have been there and are thankful we were muted."" The Legislative Research Committee quickly pulled the video of the committee meeting from YouTube. An LRC spokesman later told The Courier Journal the video would later be reposted, adding that ""as part of our normal protocol, we are removing an audio interruption that was unrelated to the substance of the meeting."" An archived video of the meeting on KET's website deleted the portion of the meeting where Harper Angel is heard arguing with her husband.

1/20/2022,"A TikTok video of a Wisconsin Badgers fan directing the slant-eye gesture at a group of Northwestern students has gone viral, with many commenters calling out the spectator for his “embarrassing” display of racism.

The incident occurred on Tuesday night at Welsh-Ryan Fieldhouse, where the Badgers won against the Northwestern Wildcats, 82-76.

But the mood between one Wisconsin fan and Northwestern students turned sour after he was seen “chirping,” or insulting, the group by making slant-eye gestures and giving them the middle finger, which was caught on video.
 


The gesture produced an audible shocked reaction from the students, who appear to be of Asian descent, as well as the person behind the camera. The spectator can be seen a few seconds later in the video being escorted out by athletics staff, but not before continuing to do the slant-eye gesture.

“Oh, he’s still doing it!” the person behind the camera is heard saying as the fan walks out of the event.

Northwestern student Kirsten Lee shared a TikTok video from her point of view of the incident.

“Was excited to go to my first NU basketball game!” she wrote. “And then this man started being racist to me and the group of Asian guys sitting behind me.”
 


TikTok users quickly slammed the Badgers fan, with one of the commenters adding: “If you have to result [sic] to racism you already lost.”

“Bro that was a grown up at a college game embarrassing,” one user wrote.

“How to risk losing your career and respect from your friends and family in 30 seconds or less,” another commented.

The University of Wisconsin-Madison’s athletics department told NextShark in a statement: “We are deeply disturbed by this behavior and find it abhorrent & disgusting.

This is no representation of what it means to be a Badger. We denounce any acts of racism or discrimination. We applaud Northwestern for removing this individual. His actions have no place at our events.”

NextShark also reached out to the athletics department at Northwestern University for further comment and will update this story accordingly.
