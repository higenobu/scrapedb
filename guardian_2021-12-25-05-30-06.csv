12/25/2021,"A man has been arrested on suspicion of burglary after 100 iPads worth £70,000 were stolen from a children’s hospital. Police were called after a report that the devices were taken from an outdoor container at Alder Hey children’s hospital in West Derby, Liverpool, on 19 November.  Merseyside police, who carried out extensive CCTV and witness inquiries, established that a man sold 40 iPads to a sell and exchange store in Liverpool last month. A 54-year-old man from Halewood was arrested on Thursday and taken to a police station on Merseyside for questioning by detectives and remains in custody. DI Steven O’Neill of Merseyside police said: “These iPads were bought as gifts to give to sick children and their families at Alder Hey children’s hospital. Thanks to the hard work of our officers we have made an arrest in the run-up to Christmas. “I hope this arrest shows how seriously Merseyside police takes such offences especially at a place that is at the heart of our community and treats so many children and babies with such complex and specialist conditions. “If you have any information regarding theft or burglary please contact or speak to our officers.”",News/UK news,Man held after 100 iPads stolen from children’s hospital in Liverpool,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/24/man-held-after-100-ipads-stolen-from-childrens-hospital-in-liverpool
