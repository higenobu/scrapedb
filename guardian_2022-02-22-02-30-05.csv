2/22/2022,"When you are searching online for some of the remotest islands on the planet, it helps to get the name right. But a row has broken out over the labelling of the Chagos Islands on Google maps. The UK maintains it still holds sovereignty over what it terms British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) – one of the smallest of red dots on the traditional, cartographic globe.  But Mauritius, which has been recognised as legitimate owner of the archipelago in a series of international court judgments and United Nations votes since 2019, has formally asked Google to re-describe the islands as part of its territory. Letters, seen by The Guardian, have been sent to the search engine’s California headquarters requesting that ‘BIOT’, which includes the strategic US military base of Diego Garcia, be, quite literally, wiped off the map. Mauritius first sent a request in January 2020 to Sundar Pichai, the chief executive officer at Google. It asked the company to “rectify this error immediately” and included as evidence references to the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice in The Hague. The judgment said the UK “unlawfully” detached the Chagos Islands from Mauritius prior to granting it independence in 1968. Mauritius said that an overwhelming majority vote by the United Nations General Assembly adopted the court’s opinion and “demanded that the United Kingdom terminate its unlawful colonial administration”. The letter said the “error could be interpreted as tacit approval ... of the UK’s unlawful administration”. The islands, it added, should be marked “Chagos Archipelago (Republic of Mauritius)”. Two further requests were sent by Mauritius criticising the “mislabelling” but no change has been made online. Legal proceedings, Mauritus has warned, could be brought against Google. Jagdish Koonjul, the Mauritian ambassador to the United Nations, said: “We never received a reply. It’s disappointing. One would have assumed that Google would be the ideal place to obtain information and that whatever they are [displaying] would be accurate. What they are showing is incorrect.” The Google Maps search engine, when it locates BIOT, merely explains that it is “a disputed British Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom situated in the Indian Ocean halfway between Tanzania and Indonesia”. Google said it was looking into the matter after being approached by the Guardian. Apple Maps, by contrast, agreed to change their labelling. Searches for both “BIOT” and “British Indian Ocean Territory” on Apple Maps produce the response “No Results Found”. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said: “The UK has no doubt as to our sovereignty over the British Indian Ocean Territory, which we have held continuously since 1814. Mauritius has never held sovereignty over the territory and the UK does not recognise its claim.” Meanwhile the former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, a long time supporter of exiled Chagossians, has published a letter of support following Mauritius’s first expedition to the Chagos Islands to assert its sovereignty. He declared: “The British government must now engage with Mauritius and negotiate a settlement of these issues. I call on the government immediately to restore the right of return of the Chagossians to their homeland and work with Mauritius on a trial resettlement programme.” Alyn Smith MP, foreign affairs spokesperson for the SNP in Westminster, said: “The SNP stands four-square behind international law and it is clear that the Chagos Islands are not UK territory. In 2019, the UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly to condemn the UK’s continuing, systematic occupation of the Chagos Islands. In the same year, the International court of justice also ruled the occupation as illegal. Last month, the UN’s International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea upheld this verdict.” “It is high time for the UK to end its illegal occupation of the Chagos Islands. The SNP will continue honouring its longstanding manifesto commitment to supporting international efforts for the Chagos Islands to be returned to their rightful owners and raising the issue at home.”",News/World news, Mauritius asks Google to label Chagos Islands as part of its territory ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/mauritius-uk-google-maps-chagos-islands-territory
2/22/2022,"When I was young – this was, of course, many scores of years ago – we spent a lot of time arguing about fur. On one level, it was a pretty crude political awakening (animal cruelty, for or against?); on another, an early introduction to meaningless position-taking, and how enjoyable it can be (if you could never afford a mink coat, does it matter whether or not you agree with buying one? Well, yes, as a matter of fact, it does!). Philosophically, the knottiest bit was whether you were allowed to buy fur secondhand, considering the fox had already died, most likely in the 1940s. Then someone looked up how astrakhan was made and it was so brutally disgusting that it killed all conversation stone dead and we moved on to arguing about vivisection. I hope I speak for my entire generation, then, when I say how delighted I am to find the controversy reawakened by Jacob Rees-Mogg, along with a similarly familiar one about the sale of foie gras. Ah, the smell of ethics-napalm in the morning. It’s like being 14 all over again. This must be how boomers feel when they trawl through Facebook and find posts about the good old days, when men could be men, and women understood that when a stranger squeezed their arse they meant that in a nice way. Thrilling rage and exhilarating disbelief; these, plus maybe snakebite and black, are what lost youth smells like.  It was the British government’s pledge to ban the import of fur and foie gras, part of a drive to make the UK the least cruel nation in the world. This was intended as an element of our sweet sovereignty, the bliss of being emancipated from the EU. Naturally, we had the freedom to outlaw these products at any time, but let’s not get bogged down in things that are real. We wasted the past five years doing that. And now the government is thinking of ditching the pledge after opposition from within the cabinet. The next five years are going to play out roughly like this: every day will throw up a technical hitch or a broken promise. Perhaps the promise was made with no heed to the technicalities behind it, or maybe its fulfilment was never part of the plan in the first place. It might be a huge promise, such as frictionless trade and boosted prosperity, or it might be a vague one, such as “your oranges will stay exactly the same (probably)”, or “genetically engineered food is nothing to worry your pretty head about”. Sooner or later it will be derailed, and then the Rees-Moggs and Trevelyans and Trusses of this world have two options. They can hope that we all get bored of the details and wander off. Deep down, they know that won’t happen. Even if the vast majority of us are already bored, there will always be one disgruntled remainer, looking up the side-effects of imazalil, or doing a deep dive on why the EU bans ractopamine in pigs. Luckily, there’s an alternative: to drag every issue, from the collapsing food and drink export industry to the made-up market demand for mink, into a culture war, pitting the woke army of generation X against the boomers who’ve been radicalised by the Daily Express. All that’s required of ministers thereafter is to sit back and watch the fireworks – the explosions, hopefully, being a lot livelier and more dangerous, now we’re free of the EU and all their boring safety and whatnot. It’s so predictable, and so basic. The problem for all of us in the woke army will be staying awake.

2/22/2022,"As Storm Franklin raged in the night, Mick Malkinson, 72, lay awake with a familiar sense of fear about what the morning would bring. From his riverside home in Tadcaster, a Yorkshire market town, he heard the “thunderous” noise of metal kegs crashing to the floor as the River Wharfe tore through a brewery warehouse nearby. “The noise was horrendous,” he said. “It was like a world war. There was no sleep at all last night.”  By dawn, the house he shares with his wife, Elizabeth, and their one-year-old cocker spaniel Miska, was among three properties completely cut off by several feet of flood water: “All we can see is a vast lake of water. We can’t get out. It will be up to my neck at the end of my drive. We will be stuck here for a couple of days now.” It is the third time in 10 years that Tadcaster has suffered significant flooding. The last time, in 2015, nearly 100 homes and businesses were damaged when Storm Eva roared downstream, partly demolishing the 18th-century bridge that connects the two sides of the town. Many of the families and businesses that suffered seven years ago woke to the same fate on Monday: Storm Franklin had led to the flooding of about 60 properties, including a butchers, an estate agent and a beauty salon on the high street. The river level did not rise as high this time as during Storm Eva – peaking at nearly 4 metres compared with 4.51 metres in 2015 – but that was little consolation to those affected. “We’re devastated. It’s heartbreaking to see it like this. It’s higher than we expected,” said Andy Charlesworth, the chairman of Tadcaster Albion Football Club, whose historic 2,000-capacity stadium was under water for the second time in seven years. The club has played football on the banks of the Wharfe since its foundation in 1892. Like many of its neighbours, however, it has been looking for a new home because of the ruinous cost of flooding. Few if any local businesses are insured in the event of flood damage – a familiar tale in towns prone to such disasters, despite calls for better protection for small firms. Charlesworth said the club was looking at between £50,000 and £80,000 worth of damage: “What we really could do with is a Premier League footballer to give us a week’s wages. That would just sort it. They’re not exactly strapped for cash.” Brian Bartle, 72, leapt out of bed in the early hours to try salvage what he could from the estate agents founded by his family in 1978. By mid-morning his shop was under water. “It’s pretty grim,” he said, watching helplessly from 300 metres away, at the edge of the water. It took a year to recover from the 2015 storm, he said, and now he was “back to square one”. “Last time it was pure neglect by the Environment Agency because the bridge was blocked with trees,” he said. “This time it’s just vast water flow coming down too fast.” Many local people questioned why it had taken so long to improve the town’s flood defences after the devastation caused by Storm Eva. A report by North Yorkshire county council last June revealed that the works, led by the Environment Agency, had been delayed until 2024 due to “inaccuracies” with the hydrological model behind the plans. The Environment Agency has been contacted for comment. Richard Sweeting, a Conservative district councillor for Tadcaster, said he was “devastated and heartbroken” that the town had been hit again. “The government need to look closely at getting some kind of flood prevention in our town,” he said. “They need to get their act together and put Tadcaster as a priority.” Zoe Devine, 48, co-owner of the flooded Devine Meats, said millions of pounds had been allocated to flood defences but the process of beginning the work appeared to have been delayed by the Covid pandemic. “You know that the people you are going to get angry at are the very people who will be out helping you, so getting angry is no good,” said Devine. “We’ve been here and done this before.” Malkinson, meanwhile, was preparing to spend days trapped in his home. The retired agricultural engineer had tried twice to sell the house after Storm Eva wrecked their ground floor, but it was “basically impossible” owing to the flood risk. When the flood sirens sounded on Sunday, they had nowhere to go so stayed put and prayed for the rain to stop. No one from the various authorities had checked up on them by Monday afternoon, he said: “It is disappointing, especially when they know that our houses are at risk. I’m sure they’ve got a lot on their plate but it irks sometimes.”",News/Environment,‘We’re devastated’: Yorkshire town hit by floods for third time in decade,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/21/were-devastated-yorkshire-town-hit-by-floods-for-third-time-in-decade
2/22/2022,"Earlier today I set you the following puzzle about a game show, which has been used during Oxford university admissions interviews for joint philosophy courses. The puzzle has three versions and I will discuss the solutions to all of them below, as well as how they relate to basic issues in computer science. 1. The standard version  You are a contestant on a game show with a £1m prize. A second contestant is in another room. The game is cooperative, so either you both win, or you both lose. You have never met the other contestant before, but you can assume they are just as logical as you are. The game begins with round 1, then proceeds with rounds 2, 3, and so on, for as many rounds as need be. On each round, each contestant has two choices: EITHER To tell the host: “I end the game” and announce a colour (any colour, of the contestant’s choice.) OR To send a message (of any length) to the other contestant. If you both choose to send a message, the messages are sent simultaneously, crossing in transit. To win the game you must both end the game on the same round, announcing the same colours. If only one of you ends the game, or you both end it announcing different colours, you lose. Round 1 is about to begin. What do you do? Solution As I mentioned in the earlier post, a bad strategy is to end the game by announcing a colour on round 1, since it is very unlikely the other contestant will do the same with the same colour. Instead, you and the other contestant should message each other to plan when to end the game, and with which colour. Here’s a sensible-sounding candidate for your first message: “let’s declare red in round 3, please confirm in round 2”. The game is cooperative, so the other contestant will follow your lead if they think it is in both of your best interests. Indeed, this strategy would work if only you sent a message in round 1, and only they responded (to confirm the plan) in round 2. You would win in round 3. However, this strategy does not work for this puzzle because your messages are sent simultaneously. Since the other contestant is as logical as you, maybe they are thinking of sending a similar message. In fact, they may send exactly the same message, in which case, you will both announce red on round 3 and win. Hurrah! But then again, they may make the proposal with a different colour. For example, let’s say you send “let’s declare red in round 3, please confirm in round 2”, as suggested above, and you receive the message: “let’s declare blue in round 3, please confirm in round 2”? Where does that leave you both? Do you stick with red or do you defer to the other contestant and announce blue? They will be struggling with the same dilemma. Indeed, you may come to the realisation that whatever message you send the other contestant, they may simultaneously send you exactly the same message but concerning a different colour. To solve the problem you need to find a way to break the symmetry. The quick answer is to flip a coin. A very good idea is to introduce an element of randomisation. For example, let’s say your first message is “I suggest we both announce red next round. I will do so if you also suggest this.” And let’s say that you receive the message “I suggest we both announce blue next round. I will do so if you also suggest this.” A sensible course of action would be to flip a coin each round, and send the “red” message on heads and the “blue” message on tails. If the other contestant does the same, then in a few rounds you will send each other the same message, and win on the following round. There are other ways to introduce randomness depending on what message you send (or receive). For example, you could flip a coin to send a message about who will lead the process. Heads, you send: “let’s say red next round, if your message indicates you will follow my suggestion.” Tails, you send: “I am going to follow your plan of action if you send one this round.” Within a few rounds you will have established a leader. Provided you send (and receive) a workable plan, any deadlock between you can be broken by introducing randomness. Flip a coin to determine whether to be insistent on your plan, or amenable to theirs, and eventually an agreement will be reached. In computer science, a similar problem comes up in an issue called contention resolution. For example, just say you connect identical computers together on a network. If the computers are identical, they will all want to talk to each other at the same time. But if they do talk at the same time they will garble each other. In order to break the symmetry, the computers do the equivalent of flipping an internal coin, so that an order of priority emerges. 2. The collision variation: The contestants have three choices each round. Either they can end the game and announce a colour, or they can send a message, as in the standard version, or they can do nothing. If both players send a message, the messages collide and are not delivered. In this case, an error message is generated. What do you do? Again, randomness comes to the rescue. Flip a coin to decide whether to send a message or stay silent. On heads, send the message “Announce red on next round, if this message gets through.” On tails, do nothing, and plan to follow whatever is suggested on the message that might be received. It is very likely that in a few rounds a message gets through one way or the other, with a quick win straight afterward. 3. The pigeon variation: Only one contestant sends a message per round. You start in round 1, the other contestant sends in round 2, and you continue alternating between you. Although this time, you are a long distance from each other and the messages are sent via carrier pigeon, which means you can never be sure that the messages arrive. What do you do? The pigeon variation is a version of the two-generals problem, a well-known problem in computer science about communication between two parties where a failure in communication is possible. Since no messages you send may reach the other contestant (and vice versa), you cannot guarantee winning the prize. However, you can attain a very high degree of confidence with the following plan. On round 1 you send the message, “We shall say red on round 1000, please confirm.” On each subsequent round, you send this message again, together with a complete record of all prior messages sent/received. The other contestant, if receiving the message on round 1 should simply follow along and send confirmations. If they don’t receive anything, they should reply with “sorry, no message received; please resend.” Most importantly, they should not start a competing plan, which would only reintroduce the priority issue of the main puzzle. Eventually, messages are likely to get through and the two players will be on track to win with high probability. Today’s puzzles were written by Joel David Hamkins, who used them on admissions candidates when he was Professor of Logic and the Sir Peter Strawson Fellow in Philosophy at University College, Oxford. “In the admissions interviews, which were generally less than 25 minutes, we were happy if a candidate got to the realisation of the symmetry issue in the main puzzle, before going on to the alternating version [in which one message is sent per round], which most students got quickly, and then the collision version, where the randomness idea seemed to arise more naturally. The best candidates were then able to realize how to apply the randomness idea to the main version. With the pigeon version of the puzzle, successful candidates realized the need to achieve confirmation and confirmation of confirmation, and a few put this together to mount the impossibility argument for the case of certainty, and most realized how to increase the likelihood of success by picking a distant round and repeating messages.” Hamkins is currently the O’Hara Professor of Philosophy and Mathematics at the University of Notre Dame.

2/22/2022,"The bombshell revelations of the Suisse secrets, reported by the Guardian and a number of international outlets, are a continuation of the path-breaking work of the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers. In one sense, it’s the same old story over and over again. Every time journalists lift the financial sector’s curtain of secrecy, a web of corruption and nefarious activities is revealed, disproportionately from shady customers and families of dictators, with a smattering of seemingly respectable politicians in democracies caught in the net. But this time, there’s something different. This time it’s not a small, obscure offshore island or a struggling developing country trying to figure out an alternative business model to drugs. It’s a major bank in the middle of Europe, in one of the most prosperous countries in the world; a country where the “rule of law” is supposed to reign supreme. Even more disappointing, given that the country and bank involved have made promises of transparency and doing better. And that’s the point: without more transparency, there can’t be accountability.  In fact, Switzerland’s position increasingly appears two-faced, with a legal framework that penalises those who attempt to pierce its secrecy. Countries around the world have passed whistleblower laws, recognising how hard it is to uncover untoward behaviour. Frances Haugen’s exposure of Facebook’s misdeeds probably wouldn’t have been possible without the US’s strong whistleblower laws. But Switzerland, one of the oldest democracies in the world, seems to have doubled down on its commitment to secrecy, regardless of the incentives it provides for bad behaviour, by threatening journalists and others who try to access data showing what is going on in the dark shadows of its financial system. What is the Suisse secrets leak? Suisse secrets is a global journalistic investigation into a leak of data from the Swiss bank Credit Suisse. It comprises more than 18,000 bank accounts that were leaked to Süddeutsche Zeitung by a whistleblower who said Swiss banking secrecy laws were ""immoral"". The data, which is only a partial capture of the bank’s 1.5 million private banking clients, is linked to more than 30,000 Credit Suisse clients. The leak includes personal, shared and corporate bank accounts – holding, on average, 7.5m Swiss francs (CHF). Almost 200 accounts in the data are worth more than 100m CHF, and more than a dozen are valued in the billions. While some accounts in the data were open as far back as the 1940s, more than two-thirds were opened since 2000. Many of those were still open well into the last decade, and a portion remain open today. The Guardian was among more than 48 media partners around the world including journalists at Le Monde, NDR, the Miami Herald and the New York Times. They spent months using the data to investigate the bank, in a project coordinated by Süddeutsche Zeitung and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). They unearthed evidence Credit Suisse accounts had been used by clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes, suggesting widespread failures of due diligence by the bank. It is not illegal to have a Swiss account and the leak also contained data of legitimate clients who had done nothing wrong. In its response, Credit Suisse said it ""strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices"". Regrettably, but not surprisingly, no Swiss outlet was able to join the global journalism collaboration due to the danger of severe legal consequences under the country’s banking secrecy laws. But journalists in other countries should be given kudos too, for risking the possibility of Swiss authorities’ prosecution. Surely, Switzerland must know the chilling effect of its legislation: perhaps its very intent was to preserve its business models as long as possible, of taking a little slice of the ill-gotten gains of others, in return for providing a safe and secret place to hoard and store the geld. The Suisse secrets have two particularly alarming aspects. The international journalistic collaboration only saw a small portion of the bank’s client data, but if in this tiny portion are already so many problematic customers, including dictators and their families, suspected war criminals, intelligence officials and chiefs, a human trafficker, sanctioned businessmen and human rights abusers – a true rogues’ gallery – what would we see if the window into the bank were larger? Second, it appears the countries that suffer the most from the bank’s assistance to bad actors are developing countries and emerging markets. The revelation confirms what experts have warned of for a long time: Switzerland agreed to an automatic information exchange mostly with other advanced countries, but not with poor countries, and especially those that might be the home to these illicit activities. As a result, kleptocracy and corruption can still flourish. It’s good to see that journalists believe in their duty to report, and that they fight for “the right to know” of the citizens of countries such as Switzerland, who can’t control what their politicians hide. Politicians in advanced countries are fond of making speeches condemning corruption elsewhere. But it is countries like Switzerland that are the key enablers: that provide the haven, ensuring the long-term returns. We should be clear: Switzerland is not alone. It rightly complains that closing the door there will simply shift the activities to real estate and finance in Miami, London or other money-laundering centres. Still, there is something morally repugnant about those in the US, UK or Switzerland living off spoils stolen from those so much poorer. And those countries like Switzerland that have designed a legal code that makes this system flourish should be especially embarrassed. How many stories, how many revelations, how many exposés, will it take for Switzerland, the US, UK and other countries to change their laws on secrecy in banking and real estate, and all the other activities that facilitate money laundering and promote crime and corruption? While this treasure trove showed Switzerland benefiting from a flow of money from poor countries, the system itself is corrupting: the rot of tainted money spoils all that it comes in touch with. Hopefully, the Suisse secrets, this enormous achievement of honest and honourable journalism, will put to shame those who have resisted creating a more transparent financial and economic system.

2/22/2022,"Boris Johnson has announced the end of all domestic Covid restrictions in England in a process starting later this week. Here is what is happening and when.  Subject to parliamentary approval of Johnson’s plan, the legal requirement to self-isolate will end on Thursday, with people instead advised to stay at home if they have Covid, or believe they do. The current need for non-vaccinated adults to self-isolate if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive will also finish. There will also be an end to contact tracing. These are also reverting to pre-Covid provisions. The £500 payment for some people on lower incomes will end on Thursday. From 24 March, statutory sick pay and employment support allowance will only start being paid after four and seven days of absence, rather than immediately, as has happened during the Covid pandemic. Free testing for the public will end in England from 1 April, with most people having to pay for lateral flow and PCR tests. There will be some exceptions, with free symptomatic tests remaining for NHS patients and in care homes, and some asymptomatic testing for both. However, NHS and care staff will no longer have routine access to asymptomatic testing. Among the public, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) will set out who will still be eligible for free tests, but it is expected to be limited to people aged 80 and above or those with compromised immune systems only. There will also be tests kept for the Panoramic study, which is assessing the efficacy of antiviral drugs, and for the Vivaldi scheme, examining Covid in care homes, and Siren, which looks at the NHS. The end of free tests is, essentially, to save money. The Department of Health and Social Care will now have to meet any costs of testing from its existing budget, after a long and bruising debate with the Treasury. The cost of tests will depend on private suppliers, but officials suggest it will be “in the low single pounds” for each lateral flow. Currently, people can get a box of seven for free each day via the post, or up to two boxes at a pharmacy. Is it possible. Officials have stressed that Covid is not yet endemic, and that it is possible new variants could emerge and be both more transmissible and severe than Omicron. There are three main areas. The first is the surveillance system, which monitors infection levels and new variants, with the ongoing ONS study, which tests a representative sample of people, being maintained at what is called a “sufficiently granular” level. Secondly, the UKHSA will keep stockpiles of lateral flow tests and maintain capacity to process PCR tests, to increase tests if needed. The third is the focus on the most vulnerable people for tests. No. This plan is for England only. Health is a devolved matter and it is up to the other UK nations to decide. The Scottish and Welsh governments have already warned against the end of free testing. For now, just a statutory instrument – a type of legislation that does not need an immediate vote. MPs would then have to approve it within 28 days.",News/World news,All you need to know about the end of Covid rules in England,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-end-of-covid-rules-in-england
2/22/2022,"Jamal Edwards, who has died suddenly aged 31, was a music entrepreneur whose online video platform SBTV has more than 1 million subscribers and collaborates with some of the world’s biggest musical names. From a small acorn, filming his friends at school in west London on a cheap mobile phone, Edwards created a very large tree, helping to launch the careers of British musical figures such as the singer-songwriters Jessie J, Emeli Sandé and Ed Sheeran, and later working with established international names that have included Drake, Nicki Minaj and Wiz Khalifa.  As Edwards’ personal fortune grew, he expanded into other entrepreneurial ventures, often with a focus on improving the lives of disadvantaged young people. Born in Luton, Bedfordshire, he was brought up in Acton, west London, by his mother, Brenda (nee Artman), an accounts manager and part-time singer, and a supportive stepfather, Patrick Edwards, a mortgage broker, who provided him with cameras and equipment in the early days of his experimentation. At Acton high school Edwards was by his own admission “a bit of a class clown”, rebelling against his strict Christian upbringing and subject to a short attention span that needed constant stimulation. The first film he made was of foxes on his local council estate, after which he began to turn his hand to recording classmates rapping, first on his mobile and then on a camera he had been given for Christmas. A fledgling singer himself, he used the initials of his rapping name, SmokeyBarz, for SBTV, a website he set up at the age of 16 in 2006 to upload his film clips and bring them to a wider audience. On his parents’ advice, Edwards quickly switched the focus away from rap to the jagged sounds of grime, which had broken out all around him in its London birthplace and which he saw as “like the punk movement, in terms of lyrics and rebellious attitude”. Shortly after its launch, SBTV became the first new media business to be featured on YouTube – then only a year old. As Edwards noted later in his career, “it was a local boy, global voice thing: when you put your stuff on the internet it goes out to a global audience straight away”. Within a short time SBTV was attracting a large number of subscribers and he was able to begin to make money out of his hobby. Having left school with a handful of GCSEs, Edwards spent three years studying for a BTec national diploma in media moving image at West London College, while also experimenting on music studio equipment at local youth centres. He later worked as a retail assistant in a Top Man clothes store to support himself until the cash from SBTV began to roll in. As SBTV gradually moved beyond grime to take in other musical genres, the scope of Edwards’s influence expanded. At the age of 20 he was featured as an example of the power of the internet in a huge advertising campaign to promote the web browser Google Chrome, which became one of the year’s most viewed items on YouTube. From then onwards his star rose rapidly, and by his early 20s, after SBTV had received significant financial backing from a private equity firm, Edwards had become one of the youngest successful entrepreneurs in the UK, a sought-after music mogul who was stopped on the streets by admirers. In his teens he had tasted fame vicariously through his mother, who, after appearing on X Factor, had picked up further television work and singing roles in a number of West End musicals. Now, however, he was in the spotlight. “I was always Brenda from The X Factor’s son, and then it switched to her being the mum of Jamal from SBTV.” While he was soon able to come to terms with the initial strains of fame at such a young age, Edwards’s youthfulness also created some difficulties in his business life. “Everyone I employed was older than me, which was very daunting,” he said. “Sometimes I was swayed by their opinions just because I’ve been brought up to respect my elders. I had to overcome that.” Appointed MBE in 2014, the year he became an ambassador for the Prince’s Trust, he branched out from SBTV into other projects. He designed and launched a headwear collection with his previous employer Top Man – informed by his hoard of hundreds of baseball caps – and was involved with a number of other fashion ventures, among them Primark. In 2017 he made a documentary with the Guardian about male suicide, in which he spoke to childhood friends who had suffered with mental health problems. Two years later he helped to refurbish and reopen four youth centres in Acton with money that he had raised from Google and the Wellcome Trust, later expanding the initiative into other parts of the UK.

2/22/2022,"Welcome to a delicious and sustainable way of eating that’s good for you, your gut microbes and the planet. If you’re looking for an easy, science-backed way to increase your energy, boost your mood, regulate your digestion, find your happy weight and slash your risk of chronic disease, you’re in the right place. As a dietitian and research scientist, I’m here to explain why simply shifting your diet to include more plants could be the best thing you ever do for your health and happiness. And it’s an approach based on facts, not fads. My new book ‘Eat More, Live Well’ shows you how versatile plant-based eating actually is. Forget cutting out or cutting down, I’m going to show you how – and why – increasing the number and range of plant foods you eat taps into the very latest scientific discoveries about how your body works best. That’s right, eating more can improve your health, and my recipes and menu plans will show you just how easy and delicious it really is.  Whether it’s something you’ve been thinking about for a while or a concept you’ve only just started hearing about, research suggests that more and more of us are interested in exploring plant-based eating. This might mean simply eating more veg meals each week; cutting down on meat, fish and other animal-derived products with meat-free Mondays; being a ‘flexitarian’; or excluding some or all animal products completely, as in vegetarianism or veganism. But we all know that we need to eat more veg, and there’s lots of information already out here, so what’s different about this book? Well, first of all, the science. I’m not promoting a fully vegan diet, because research doesn’t necessarily support that from a health perspective (more on that in the book). I’m not even suggesting you should go vegetarian, although this book is still for you if you’re vegetarian or vegan. What the evidence suggests is that we could all benefit from eating more plants, but that doesn’t necessarily have to mean only plants. So, rather than being about what not to eat, this book is all about the many varied and astounding benefits, flavour included, of basing your diet around plants. Because once they’re the star attraction, trust me, you’ll experience a health transformation. My first book, Eat Yourself Healthy, was designed to help people identify and tackle their digestive issues and achieve great gut health. Since it was published, I’ve received thousands of messages from people whose health is flourishing after following the programme it sets out. I know there are lots of you out there who are on board with the idea that gut health underpins overall health. Many people also got in touch to ask for a followup that looked more closely at exactly which foods our gut loves and why. So, this book zooms out and speaks to anyone and everyone who simply wants to eat in a way that’s more aligned with what our bodies (and gut microbes) need. And what they definitely need more of is plants. My approach to nutrition is categorically not about dieting. Neither is it a trendy fad that cuts out food groups or nutrients. Instead, it’s your introduction to, and inspiration for, a life-changing way of eating that brings profound, science-backed health benefits in both the short and the long term. Sure, one of those may be to do with weight management, but the benefits linked to nourishing our gut microbes go much further than that – from mood, to skin, to hormones and immunity; they are powerful little things. There is no calorie counting here, no weighing and measuring (of yourself or the foods). In fact, there’s none of the cutting out you may see with other eating plans. I see this approach as enriching, not restricting; inclusive, not exclusive. More plants, more variety, more fibre, more flavour. I call it the Diversity Diet. We know that, generally speaking, the greater the diversity of the trillions of gut bacteria that live in our digestive track (known as our gut microbiome, or GM), the better our overall health and resistance to infection. I always come back to that sports team analogy – you need a breadth of skills to be at the top of your game. And with so many different types of microbe out there (scientists estimate there are tens of thousands of strains of unique bacteria that can dwell in the gut), it’s no surprise that we each have a distinct combination within us. Our GM is unique to us, like our fingerprints. Identical twins may share the same human genes, environment and lifestyle, but their GM will always be different. So long as it’s well supported (that’s where Eat More, Live Well comes in), our inner universe is a hive of activity, working super-hard at tasks like: Munching up fibre and phytochemicals from the plants we eat. Making vitamins (K and the different Bs), amino acids, hormones and chemical messengers. Training our immune system. Activating and deactivating medicines and toxins (this explains why, at least in part, people can respond in different ways to the same medications). Making chemicals that strengthen the gut barrier, helping to balance blood sugars, lower blood fats and regulate appetite. Communicating with our brain, skin, liver, thyroid, heart and just about every organ in the human body. Protecting us against a proliferation of harmful microbes. Assisting gut movement and function. In other words, a thriving GM can optimize digestion, immunity, metabolism, hormones, brain function and gene expression (turning our genes ‘on and off’, affecting what scientists previously thought was our ‘destiny’). I don’t know about you, but with them having this responsibility, I think we owe it to these microbes to give them as much support as we can. Whether you think of your GM as your inner universe, Tamagotchi, pet, friend or simply untapped potential, the next time you sit down to a meal, it’s worth acknowledging you’re never just eating for one. The empowering news is that so much of our GM’s health and happiness is in our control. There are many ways we can look after our GM, in terms of what we eat and how we treat it (with things like sleep, stress and even exercise). In fact, our diet and lifestyle choices actually have a much bigger effect on how healthy our GM is than our genetics do. And so far, research indicates that people who consume high-fibre diets made up of a wide range of whole plant-based foods from the ‘Super Six’ (wholegrain, vegetables, fruit, legumes, nuts, seeds and herbs and spices) typically have the greatest GM diversity and stability. This was the main driving force behind me writing Eat More, Live Well – to spread this landmark discovery beyond the research bubble and help as many people as possible to embrace the far-reaching benefits of the Diversity Diet.

2/22/2022,"The chair of UK Sport, Katherine Grainger, has said future funding for winter sports will be based on grassroots participation as well as medals, after Great Britain departed the Beijing Winter Olympics with just two medals. Grainger pointed to the need to “make our sports as wide and diverse as possible” and to reach a wider cross-section of the public. “It comes down to the fact that this public money – the public should have a benefit from it,” Grainger said. “A huge amount of that has been in the past two decades built around the focus on success, meaning the medals, and that is what gives us that status globally.”  Both Team GB medals were secured in the final days of the event after gold- and silver-medal performances by the curling teams led by Eve Muirhead and Bruce Mouat. Other winter sports face questions about Team GB’s failure to match its target of three to seven medals. Great Britain won a joint-record five medals in both 2014 and 2018. “Curling lifted the team, no doubt, but a lot of people – athletes first and foremost – would have been disappointed with the performances out there and we need to find out the reasons why that happened,” Grainger said. This will be a moment for reflection as the various sports begin to review recent events and look to find solutions in order to improve in the years leading up to Milan-Cortina in 2026. “We will make our big investment decisions around the summer this year, and the main thing is for all the sports individually to go into a huge review process of not just the Games itself but also the last four years to see what worked, what didn’t work, and what can be improved,” she said. Despite frustration over some results, Grainger argues that the overall impact of the sports should also be considered: “You might be saying, ‘That’s a disappointing Games.’ But actually the influence it can have and the reach it can have really matters. And that is why we will keep funding the winter sports and really backing them.”",Sport/Sport,"Winter Olympics funding will not just be guided by medals, says UK sport chair",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/21/winter-olympic-funding-will-not-just-be-guided-by-medals-says-uk-sport-chair

2/22/2022,"It is, by any measure, an extraordinary intervention in Australia’s rapidly evolving electricity market. A consortium worth hundreds of billions of dollars on Saturday lodged a formal offer to buy AGL Energy – the country’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter – for just short of 5% above the closing share price on Friday.  The headline name behind the bid is Mike Cannon-Brookes, the 42-year-old co-founder of software company Atlassian, green solutions investor, climate action advocate and one of Australia’s richest people. But in reality, Cannon-Brookes’ company Grok Ventures is the smaller player in the consortium, which is led by Brookfield, a Canadian investment giant with $688bn worth of assets under management last year. Including AGL’s debt, the bid was just short of A$8bn. According to the main players, a significant part of the motivation is to close and replace the company’s coal-fired power plants and prevent a controversial demerger that would hive off those coal plants from AGL into a new entity called Accel Energy. The consortium says it has up to $20bn to spend on building and contracting at least 8 gigawatts of renewable energy and energy storage to replace about 7GW of existing power plants. AGL’s Bayswater and Loy Yang A coal plants, currently scheduled to shut by 2033 and 2045, would be gone by 2030. The company would reach net zero emissions by 2035 and suddenly be playing its part in limiting global heating to 1.5C, in line with scientific advice. The proposal is much bigger than just the coal power plants. It would involve Brookfield and Grok Ventures acquiring all of AGL’s generation assets and its retail business. Cannon-Brookes stresses it isn’t a philanthropic investment. He says he is confident backing renewable energy over ailing old coal power plants can keep electricity prices down, create more than 10,000 jobs and wipe out about 40m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year – more than 8% of Australia’s annual emissions footprint – while turning a profit. Analysts and some within AGL see access to the company’s 4.5 million customers across the country as a key motivation for any would-be suitor. For Brookfield’s part, it is a shareholder in fossil fuel assets, but it is noteworthy that the bid includes the name of Mark Carney, the company’s head of transition investing since 2020. He made his name as first the governor of the Bank of Canada, then the Bank of England, and then the United Nations special envoy for climate action and finance in the lead-up to last year’s Cop26 summit in Glasgow. A Brookfield renewable energy arm has about US$65bn assets under management. The bid is timed with at least one eye on the upcoming demerger, which AGL declared on Monday was on track to happen by 30 June. The consortium says the split risked leading to the separated entities trading at a lower share price, reducing value for shareholders. There was a swift rejection after the board met on Sunday afternoon. It claimed the offer “materially undervalues the company”, as it offered only a 4.7% premium on Friday’s share price. The consortium rejected this rebuttal just as quickly. It says the offer represented about a 20% premium on the company’s three-month volume-weighted average share price of $6.28 and pointed to its expectation the value would fall after the split. Cannon-Brookes told Guardian Australia on Monday the consortium would continue to engage with AGL and he would focus on “trying to explain to shareholders why we believe this is the best option”. Within AGL, there was some excitement at the prospect that a billionaire entrepreneur with Cannon-Brookes’ success at creating a software firm was making a play for the company. It had lost up to 80% of its share value over the five years prior to the takeover offer although its stock had started to bounce back in the past 12 months. AGL shares gained more than 10% during Monday’s trade. According to the experts, yes, though it would be challenging. Cannon-Brookes was quick to point to a draft blueprint for the future grid published by the Australian Energy Market Operator in December, known as the integrated system plan. That document suggested under a step-change scenario – now considered the most probable path – coal would exit the system at roughly three times the pace then proposed and there could be a nine-fold increase in large-scale renewable energy such as wind and solar farms. It is not a report the Morrison government tends to emphasise. No one disputes that the rise of renewable energy is making coal plants unviable as the around-the-clock generators they were meant to be. They can’t compete with an influx of cheap solar energy in the middle of the day and were mostly not built to ramp down and then back up when needed. Department officials project renewable energy will increase from about 30% now to 69% by 2030. Labor says under its policies it would reach 82%. It is not only AGL that is under pressure. In the most recent announcement, Origin Energy gave notice that the country’s biggest coal-fired power plant, Eraring, could shut seven years earlier than scheduled – in 2025 rather than 2032. Plenty, including whether the consortium would be open to paying more and the timing and specifics of the investment plan. The bid would have to be cleared by the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Buying AGL would involve taking on 3.2 million gas customers. Cannon-Brookes indicated the consortium would want to move them to renewable electricity, a significant undertaking in its own right. Cannon-Brookes acknowledges it is “on a global scale a massive decarbonisation effort” but says the plan makes sense. The consortium’s offer letter says it conducted detailed market modelling with consultants Marsden Jacob Associates and was confident its plan was achievable. “The economics stacks up, the science stacks up, what we require is just the gumption to go for it and actually make it happen, and that’s what we’re trying to do,” Cannon-Brookes says.",News/Business,Why is a tech billionaire trying to buy Australia’s dirtiest energy company AGL?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/why-is-a-tech-billionaire-trying-to-buy-australias-dirtiest-energy-company-agl
2/22/2022,"The New South Wales transport minister, David Elliott, started Monday on a rhetorical cliff and kept walking. On Sydney radio station 2GB, Elliott described industrial action taken by the state’s rail workers as “terrorist-like activity”, then accused the Rail, Tram and Bus Union of acting like “cowards”, spreading “bullshit” and “hijacking the city”.  At a hastily arranged media conference a few hours later, he effectively accused union members of seeking to change the government. The industrial action taken by the rail union was designed to “bully the electorate” into voting for Labor, as well as “disrupt the recovery from Covid”, he said. Elliott was not alone. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, weighed in, also on 2GB, to condemn the “strike”, while the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, described the action as a “coordinated attack by the Labor party and the union movement”. Labor and the union movement, Perrottet said, were “in bed with each other to cause mass destruction in our city and our states”. The union flatly rejected the government’s description of their industrial action as a “strike”, calling it a “low level” measure that wouldn’t have affected services. As the day went on it became clear the government had taken the extraordinary step of closing down the transport network because it had “misinterpreted” an agreement it struck with the union during negotiations over the weekend. Workers had turned up for their shifts on Monday to find they had been locked out by the transport department. “The NSW government is spitting the dummy and trying to make a point,” the RTBU secretary, Alex Claassens, said. While the government accused the union of taking politically motivated industrial action, Elliott’s interventions on Monday were revealing in terms of his own focus. Neither his 2GB interview or the snap press conference – which some media were not alerted to – were held with transport officials who could have explained, for example, what contingency measures had been implemented to assist commuters during the shutdown of the network. Nor was the government able to explain – beyond citing the safety concerns of those same absent transport officials – why the network needed to be abruptly shut down when the union had publicised its intention to take limited industrial action as early as Wednesday last week. Indeed Perrottet was asked on Monday on whether the shutdown was a copy of Qantas’ decision in 2011 to ground its fleet amid an industrial dispute, a step which prompted the Fair Work Commission to terminate the workers’ action because of the risk to the economy. He denied that was the case. By Monday evening, the government had backed away, with limited services to run on Tuesday and the Coalition agreeing to “continue to negotiate with the unions and work through their list of claims”. Elliott’s handling of the matter was being questioned by senior ministers and the union had committed to continue its planned industrial action after crowing the transport minister had “backed down”. “To deliberately shut down the rail network on such a big day for many people, seemingly so they can run a fear campaign about unions, is quite extraordinary,” Claassens said. But despite the messy handling of the dispute, the government’s decision to lash out at the union on Monday is revealing. It is certainly true that with a federal election looming and the next NSW election only 12 months away, the union movement is flexing its muscle. Indeed, Unions NSW boss Mark Morey was on the front page of the Daily Telegraph on Monday declaring 2022 would be the year of the strike if the government refused to scrap its 2.5% wages cap. It was less than a week ago that the state’s nurses were holding their first state-wide strike in almost a decade outside the state’s parliament, and teachers and bus drivers have also flagged their intention to conduct further industrial action. The NSW Public Services Association secretary, Stewart Little, said his union – which represents prison workers, some education staff and a variety of other public sector workers – would also consider taking protected action if the state government moved to repeal Covid-era workers’ compensation laws. Little also said removing the 2.5% wages cap – which has been in place since the NSW Liberal government came into power in 2011 – had taken on a new urgency for unions amid increasing job pressures during the pandemic, as well as inflation and increased cost of living pressures. “I think it’s inevitable that you’ll see more industrial action and strike action,” Little said on Monday. “The pressures on working people are increasing and the unions can’t sit by while our members are seeing their conditions deteriorate.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It’s in that context that Elliott, Perrottet and the prime minister’s comments must be viewed. The NSW government believes that a year out from a state election it is being targeted by a concerted union campaign. But it also sees an opportunity. By painting Monday’s action as an “unAustralian” act of “industrial bastardry”, as Elliott did, the government is seeking to paint the union movement – and with it Labor – as out of touch with the concerns of everyday people. “This is reminding me of the way they behaved in the 1970s, and I don’t think they’ve read the room,” Elliott said on 2GB. It’s a tactic that has worked before. After all, the majority of Australians are no longer members of a trade union, and many see industrial action as a disruptive annoyance, and conservative governments often feel on safe ground fighting a trade union movement they claim is unrepresentative of average people. The question is whether, after two years of a pandemic in which frontline workers such as nurses, teachers and, indeed, transport workers, have kept the country going, it is the government that has “read the room” by picking this fight.",News/Australia news,More strikes ‘inevitable’ in NSW as government ramps up anti-union rhetoric,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/22/more-strikes-inevitable-in-nsw-as-government-ramps-up-anti-union-rhetoric
2/22/2022,"A majority of voters see China and the bilateral relationship as a complex issue to be managed rather than a threat to be confronted, and more voters trust Labor than the Coalition to manage that complexity, the latest Guardian Essential poll suggests. After a bare-knuckle political week where the prime minister, Scott Morrison, branded Labor’s deputy leader a “Manchurian candidate” and declared the ALP unequal to the task of managing the regional threat environment, the latest poll of 1,089 respondents suggests Australians hold a nuanced view of the Australia-China relationship.  While last week’s partisan confrontation played out in stark binary terms, the new poll shows 61% of respondents characterise the bilateral relationship with Beijing as complex, and only 26% see it as a threat to be confronted. The proportion of respondents seeing the China relationship as a threat is now only two percentage points higher than it was when voters were asked this same question in September 2021. Last year, 66% of respondents characterised the relationship as a complex dynamic to be managed. Morrison last week repeatedly accused Labor of being “weak” on security threats and declared that only the Coalition would not “appease” Beijing. But the data shows the opposition currently maintains a nine-point lead over the Coalition when people are asked which party they trust to manage the Australia-China relationship. Just over a quarter of respondents (28%) say they trust the Coalition to build the relationship in Australia’s best interests, while 37% say they trust Labor to, and 34% of respondents are unsure. Morrison sought the partisan confrontation with Labor on national security and China after suffering a significant parliamentary defeat the week before, when moderate Liberals effectively torpedoed the prime minister’s signature religious discrimination legislation. The politicisation was blatant enough to prompt a rare public rebuke from the head of Asio, Mike Burgess. Burgess warned twice last week the pre-election weaponisation of serious issues made it harder for Asio to do its job. Former Asio chief Dennis Richardson went further. He argued in a series of interviews last week that the Morrison government was serving China’s interests, not Australia’s, by politicising national security ahead of the election, and “seeking to create the perception of a difference [between the major parties] when none in practice exists”. National security is generally considered fertile political territory for the Coalition. But metrics charting primary voting intention and approvals suggest Morrison and the Coalition went backwards during the past parliamentary fortnight – although the movements are within the poll’s margin of error, which is plus or minus three points. Voting intention figures calculated by Guardian Essential now express the head-to-head metric of the major party contest as two-party preferred “plus” rather than the standard two-party preferred measure. This change in methodology, adopted after the 2019 election, highlights the proportion of undecided voters in any survey, providing accuracy on the limits of any prediction. Labor is on 49% (up two points) and the Coalition on 45% (down one point), with 6% of respondents undecided in the latest two-party preferred “plus” measure. Labor’s primary vote is 38%, up from 35% a fortnight ago, and the Coalition is on 35%, down from 37%, with the number of undecided voters going from 8% to 6%. Labor’s primary vote in the current survey is the highest it has been since January 2020, when Morrison’s standing took a hammering during the catastrophic bushfires of that summer. Morrison’s net approval has also moved from zero to negative in the latest data, with 44% (down two points) of respondents saying they approve of the prime minister’s performance and 49% (up three points) saying they disapprove. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Anthony Albanese’s net approval has bumped up from zero to positive, with 42% (up three points) of respondents saying they approve of the Labor leader and 39% (steady) saying they disapprove. Albanese also closed the gap slightly with Morrison on the poll’s “better prime minister measure”. Morrison still leads his Labor counterpart 40% to 35%, with 25% undecided. A fortnight ago Morrison led Albanese 42% to 34% with 25% undecided. A number of questions put to voters about the attributes of the two major party leaders suggest Morrison has lost standing with voters since the middle of last year. But despite his current difficulties, Morrison continues to rate ahead of the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, and the defence minister, Peter Dutton, as the preferred Liberal party leader (30% say Morrison, 13% say Frydenberg and 9% say Dutton, while 16% respond “other” and 32% are unsure).",News/Australia news,"More voters trust Labor than Coalition to manage Australia-China relationship, poll suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/22/more-voters-trust-labor-than-coalition-to-manage-australia-china-relationship-poll-suggests
2/22/2022,"The prime minister, Scott Morrison, will announce $804m for strategic and scientific programs in Antarctica over the next decade as the government flags its intention to increase Australia’s role in the increasingly contested region. Announcing the funding pledge in the key Tasmanian seat of Lyons on Tuesday, Morrison will talk up the commitment as a “clear international signal of Australia’s world-leading Antarctic leadership”.  The package – about half of which is committed over the next five years – will include $136m for charting activities, mobile stations and traverse capability, and $109m for a new drone fleet, autonomous vehicles and medium lift helicopters. This will allow the government to map “inaccessible and fragile areas of east Antarctic”, and set up a new “Antarctic eye” program that will monitor parts of the continent with integrated sensors and cameras that provide real-time information. The helicopters, which have a range of 550km, will allow researchers to travel to parts of the continent that have not previously been accessible using the government research vessel RSV Nuyina as a launchpad. “The money we are investing in drone fleets, helicopters and other vehicles will enable us to explore areas of east Antarctica’s inland that no country has ever been able to reach before,” Morrison said ahead of Tuesday’s announcement. “My government will continue to back our world-class scientists and expeditioners with the necessary funding and resources, because their research on the frozen continent and in the Southern Ocean is critically important to Australia’s future.” A range of other projects under the package will focus on new scientific endeavours, including $7.4m for research focused on Antarctic ice sheet science to build global understanding of climate change impacts. The government said this will improve Australia’s ability “to support Pacific partners to monitor information about climate and oceans, including sea level rise”. Last year, ice scientists warned that parts of the massive Thwaites glacier in west Antarctica – about 100 times the size of the United Kingdom – could fracture and collapse within five years, accelerating the rate of sea level rises. The package will also include $4.7m for RSV Nuyina to conduct extended science voyages, while $17.4m will be committed for marine science in the Southern Ocean and a new state-of-the-art krill aquarium in Hobart. Another $14.3m will be committed for environmental management, including a “Cleaner Antarctica Strategy” to remove legacy waste. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, said that in the face of increasing pressures in the region, there was “strategic importance” in Australia’s pursuit of scientific leadership. “We need to ensure that the Antarctic remains a place of science and conservation, one that is free from conflict and which is protected from exploitation,” Ley said. From 2026-27, the government will allocate an extra $92.2m a year for further support of Antarctic activities, which is also included in the $804m figure. The announcement comes amid a debate about how Australia should be protecting its interests in the Antarctic territories, where China has become increasingly assertive, particularly over fishery access. The issue came to a head after Ley scrapped plans to build a 2.7km concrete runway on Antarctica, prompting China hawks within the Coalition to blast the decision as “retrograde”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A Lowy Institute paper published last year said that China “wants to benefit economically, and potentially militarily, from Antarctica”, and was pushing the terms of the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), primarily over fisheries access, and was active on the ice. It said that prior to 2016, China’s Antarctic stations and science “seemed designed to position it for a territorial claim in the AAT if the Antarctic Treaty were overturned at some point in the future”. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Marise Payne, said the investment was a clear marker of Australia’s “enduring commitment to the Antarctic Treaty system” and Australia’s leadership within it. The funding package allocates $3.4m to enhance Australia’s international engagement “to support the rules and norms of the Antarctic Treaty system and promote Australia’s leadership in Antarctic affairs.” Morrison said the investment in Antarctica would directly support jobs in Australia, and particularly in Tasmania, “with Australian businesses, contractors, medical suppliers and providers reaping the benefits of local procurement.” The prime minister has begun the week campaigning in the Tasmanian marginal seats of Bass and Lyons, which are crucial to the Coalition’s chances of remaining in government. On Monday, he visited a winery with the member for the seat of Bass, Bridget Archer, who has clashed with Morrison over his failure to deliver on an election commitment for an integrity commission and the government’s proposed religious discrimination laws. Archer crossed the floor on both issues. Morrison said that Archer was a “fiery” member of his team, but said the Liberal party “don’t throw someone out” if they have disagreements. “It’s called Liberal for a reason. The Labor party throw people out when they speak up on important issues to them,” Morrison said. “Bridget, I know, is passionate. Bridget has come with life experience to our team that I greatly value and I greatly respect. You know, we love Bridge. We really do.

2/22/2022,"When I told a friend I was writing about the most environmentally friendly way to care for polyester, he joked: “Put it in the bin.” Since polyester is a plastic that won’t biodegrade in landfill, he’s definitely wrong. But his joke reflects a growing concern that polyester clothing is an environmental hazard. To start with, virgin polyester is derived from fossil fuels, and as the technology stands, recycled polyester is more accurately downcycled plastic. The process takes bottles out of a closed loop system and degrades them so they can’t be recycled again.  These environmental challenges are compounded during use. Polyester is a smelly, sweaty, stain-prone material that sheds plastic microfibres when it is washed and worn. But, because it’s cheap, it’s in more than half our clothes. Since it’s very likely we all have something made from polyester in our wardrobes, here is some expert advice on how to minimise its impact. Microfibres are tiny particles that break off our clothes when we wash and wear them. Velina Karadzhova, the head of First Sentier MUFG Sustainable Investment Institute, says they’ve “been found in air, rivers, oceans, soils, tap water and human food such as fish and vegetables”. To make matters worse, since synthetic materials don’t break down in natural environments, microfibre pollution is accumulating. Paul Servin, the applications development director at Xerox Technology Group, says “around one third of all primary microplastic pollution comes from washing our clothes in the washing machine”. Rebecca Van Amber, a textile scientist from RMIT university, says you can significantly reduce microfibre shedding by making simple changes to your laundry. She suggests using a liquid detergent and lower water temperature, switching to a front-loader washing machine and, instead of tumble drying your clothes, hanging them out to dry. According to Servin, washing garments in a full load of laundry can reduce shedding by up to five times. He also recommends washing garments less often and says: “Try and consider if the garments need washing or if they can be cleaned in other ways.” Servin says having your washing machine fitted with a microfibre filter is the most effective way to prevent microfibres from wash cycles entering the environment. The latest filter developed by Xeros, called the XFiltra, can capture more than 90% of microfibre pollution. In recognition of the scope of the problem, governments are moving to make microfibre filters a requirement on washing machines. In Australia, the National Plastics Plan aims for “an industry-led phase-in of microfibre filters on new residential and commercial washing machines by 1 July 2030”. There is similar legislation being drafted in the UK and France. Another way to prevent microfibre pollution is by using a Guppyfriend bag. Place your polyester or synthetic garments inside it during washing. Studies show the bags reduce the amount of shedding and catch microfibres that do break off. But, Servin says, be mindful of how you dispose of microfibres caught inside the bag. “The temptation would be to rinse it out under a tap, which would defeat the object.” Experts say the safest thing is to put them in the bin. Another thing to keep in mind is that different fabrics shed microfibres at different rates. Karadzhova says polyester sheds about three times more than nylon, while fabrics from mixed materials also appear to shed less than fabrics made from 100% polyester. Textile weave should be factored in too, Van Amber says, to avoid “fabrics which are fluffy and pill” because this is visible evidence of microfibre shedding. A good example is fleece fabrics that have a brushed surface and raised fibres. She says these fabrics are “much more likely to shed fibres than yoga pants” because smooth stretchy materials are made of longer fibres that have less threads protruding and so are less susceptible to shedding. Since polyester is plastic, it has a complicated relationship with sweat and oil. Which is to say, it holds on to both and won’t let them go. That’s why polyester starts to smell and why stains on polyester can be impossible to wash out. “Any stain should be treated as quickly as possible” because if it has time to dry and set, it will be much more difficult to remove, Van Amber says. “Gently blot an oil stain with soap or detergent and water immediately.” Sweat stains should also be moved on quickly to prevent odour from setting in. Van Amber says polyester fabrics with a looser weave or knit structure should be more resistant to odours. This is because “the gaps and spaces between the fibres and yarns facilitates air flow through the fabric.” On the other hand, fabrics with a very tight weave should be more resistant to staining because “any liquid spilled on it will land as a drop” and the tightness of the structure should delay the drop being absorbed. Finally, be aware of polyester or synthetics claiming to have antimicrobial and anti-odour capabilities. Studies show that while they can control bacteria, they do not control smell.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Move quickly and make small changes: how to reduce the impact of your polyester clothes,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/22/move-quickly-and-make-small-changes-how-to-reduce-the-impact-of-your-polyester-clothes
2/22/2022,"Australian basketballer Josh Giddey has won many plaudits of late. During the recent NBA All-Star weekend, LeBron James became the latest to heap praise on the 19-year-old Oklahoma City Thunder rookie. “He has a great pace about the game, great vision,” said the basketball legend. “He’s playing beautiful basketball.” Giddey has won rookie of the month in the Western Conference for three consecutive months, and made history as the youngest-ever NBA player to record a triple-double. Most recently, just last week, the Victorian became the first NBA rookie to register three straight triple-doubles since basketball Hall-of-Famer Oscar Robertson 60 years ago.  But a true measure of Giddey’s character can be found not in this rush of recent success, but from a time of disappointment. Mid-last year, the teenager was part of the training squad for the national team when Giddey was told he would not be part of Australia’s 12-man side at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. It would have been a crushing blow, missing out on the opportunity to play in the green and gold on the grandest stage, just edged out by fellow youngster Josh Green. Ultimately, the non-selection cost Giddey a bronze medal – the Boomers’ historic first-ever international triumph. Yet he took it in his stride. “I could have sat around and sooked about it for a while,” Giddey admitted last year. “[But] I used it as motivation. I didn’t hold grudges and say, ‘they should have put me in the team’ or ‘this was wrong’. I just accepted the decision, moved forward.” Despite being cut from the Tokyo team, Giddey remained with the Boomers at a camp in Las Vegas – starring in an exhibition match against Nigeria. Rather than smart from non-selection, he put his head down and got to work. Giddey’s attitude towards disappointment suggests a bright future ahead. Being an elite basketballer comes with more than its fair share of ups and downs; players who can dust themselves off after a fall are the ones who thrive. In basketball, you quite literally miss every shot you don’t take. “Going forward,” he said of the Boomers snub, “it’s probably going to be for the better as it motivates me and makes me hungrier to make the next team.” Born in Melbourne, Giddey has basketball in his blood. His parents, Kim and Warrick Giddey, were both professional basketballers with the Melbourne Tigers. Kim was known for her scoring, Warrick for his tight defence. Giddey junior combines both attributes; he is now a 6ft 9in guard with superb on-court intelligence (even if his father jokes, of the complementary parental traits, that his son “excels in neither of those two areas.”) Midway through high school, Giddey joined the NBA Global Academy – co-located with the Basketball Australia Centre of Excellence, within the Australian Institute of Sport, in Canberra (where, coincidentally, he was coached by Marty Clarke, a former teammate of his father). The AIS basketball program is internationally renowned: almost every male and female Australian basketball star in the past four decades has come through the system. It was at the AIS where Giddey blossomed, adding four inches of height to press his claim for an NBA draft spot. With his wingspan, gangly build and smart passing game, the teenager quickly emerged as a future star. Yet rather than follow the well-trodden path to an American college team, Giddey opted to remain at home for an extra season – joining National Basketball League outfit the Adelaide 36ers, where he won rookie of the year. It was an astute decision, becoming the first home-grown talent to participate in the league’s Next Stars program, which has attracted a number of international prospects to Australia in recent years. Even still, Giddey was tipped to go mid-first round in the NBA draft; most observers predicted the Australian would be picked at 10 or lower. Instead, in a minor-shock, Oklahoma took Giddey with their No 6 pick, putting him in an elite category of Australians to have been drafted in the top 10, alongside former No 1 picks Andrew Bogut and Ben Simmons, and Dante Exum, who went at five. But the selection came as no surprise to Giddey, who had his heart set on the Thunder (he told a team reporter: “Ever since the pre-draft process started, Oklahoma is where I wanted to be. I said to my agent, ‘you’ve got to do everything you can to talk to these guys and get them to draft me’.”) The draft pick proved shrewd business for OKC. While the team languish in 14th in the Western Conference, Giddey has made a strong bid for rookie of the year. He is averaging 12.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 6.4 assists a game. At the All Star weekend, James singled out the Thunder’s general manager for praise. “The MVP over there is Sam Presti,” he said. “I mean, Josh Giddey is great. But Sam Presti, I don’t understand this guy’s eye for talent. He drafted [Kevin Durant], Russ [Westbrook], Jeff Green, Serge Ibaka, Reggie Jackson, Josh Giddey and the list goes on and on and on.” If Giddey is to follow in the footsteps of the likes of Durant and Westbrook, he has a long road ahead. Many rookies shine bright before fading into obscurity. But the 19-year-old from Melbourne has the physical attributes, basketball intelligence and mental fortitude to star at the highest level. Come the Paris Olympics in two years’ time, there is little chance Giddey will miss out again. Australian basketball has a new star.",Sport/Sport,"Disappointment, not success, the true measure of Josh Giddey’s character | Kieran Pender",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/22/disappointment-not-success-the-true-measure-of-josh-giddeys-character
2/22/2022,"By far our most memorable and worst gig was the first one, on 23 October 1982. Billy Walsh, who was then in an early version of the Cosmic Psychos called Spring Plains, had run up all these parking fines. So my friend organised a gig to make the money back. Bass player Phil Nelson and I were just learning how to play, but he said “Let’s get a band together, we’ll get more people there.” So that was why the band started – to play Bill Walsh’s parking fines. It was supposed to be a one-off show.  At the time, Hunters & Collectors were the coolest band in town, and I wanted a piss-take of their name – something AND something else – so my friend Tess, now my wife, goes, “How about the Painters and Dockers?” as a joke. And I said, “That’s it!” At the time, there was a royal commission into the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, because some members had literally been knocking each other off. Our singer Paulie Stewart ended up in the band at the last minute. He met Phil at the Prahran market and told him he could play trumpet. Basically, anyone we knew who said they could play anything was in. We didn’t have a drummer, so Bill played for Painters and Dockers and Spring Plains that night. He was so fucked that in one of the songs he just stopped playing – his arms were so tired he couldn’t keep up. We played the gig at a pub called the Rising Sun in Port Melbourne. What we didn’t know was that this was where members of the actual Painters and Dockers Union used to drink. I remember my eldest brother saying to me, “You’ve got to change your name. These guys don’t fuck around, they’ll kill you!” But while we were playing, one of them walked in (the crowd parted like the Red Sea) and gave us all a beer, so then I thought, OK, we’re not gonna die. Unfortunately, a man who lived nearby got the shits with the noise so came in with a machete and started chopping up the mixing desk because he wanted us to stop playing. Six divvy vans turned up, cut the whole street off, and the whole pub evacuated in two minutes. We were running down the street with our amplifiers trying to get out of there. It was insane. The next morning my mate went to the pub so we could get paid. It was probably about five or six hundred bucks – enough to pay Billy’s fines – but the owner at the time said, “Oh, there’s been a bit of damage, let’s just call it even.” Check out Painters and Dockers’ Facebook page for upcoming gigs around Australia",Arts/Music,Painters and Dockers on their worst gig: a man stormed in with a machete,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/22/painters-and-dockers-on-their-worst-gig-a-man-stormed-in-with-a-machete
2/22/2022,"In 2019, Samuel Bailey’s play Shook marked him out as a distinctive new talent, writing about masculinity, class and friendship. But when he first began life as a playwright, his dramas were, he says, “rip-offs” of works he admired. “The first few plays I wrote were a Sam Shepard western, a Nick Payne Constellations play, and an Annie Baker. I was thinking: ‘Oh, this is what a play is!’” Having grown up on a housing estate in Worcester, Bailey felt reluctant to bring that world on to the stage. “It took me quite a long time to feel like I could write about where I came from and that people would be interested in it, partly because it wasn’t necessarily what I was seeing on stage.”  That changed 10 years ago when he met Jesse Jones, who is now directing Bailey’s new play, Sorry, You’re Not a Winner, produced by Paines Plough. Jones read one of his early plays and said Bailey was mimicking other writers. “He asked me ‘What do you want to write about?’ I told him a bit about my background, and he said ‘Why are you not writing about this?’ It took him telling me that the thing that I was ashamed of was actually what was interesting … and it took a while for me to come round [to the idea that] here was something I could tell authentically.” Shook featured three fathers attending a parenting class at a young offender institution. An insightful study of the way men speak to each other and the intimacies they form, it had bags of humour and tenderness. Shook won him the Papatango new writing prize and had a sold-out run at Southwark Playhouse in London, with a West End transfer set for the spring of 2020 (the pandemic stymied that plan). “Shook was personal in the sense that it was about people I grew up with, cared about, and listening to their stories.” His new play, a coming-of-age drama about friendship, leaving home and entering a middle-class milieu, is closer to Bailey’s own lived experience. “I had been wrestling with it for most of my 20s – feeling this conflict between having left home, and not feeling quite comfortable in this place that I exist now – a more middle-class space at university and then a middle-class space in theatre. I felt like I should be really happy because this is what I want to do but something was making me feel on edge at times.” His girlfriend suggested he make sense of this internal conflict by turning it into a play. It begins the night before Liam departs for Oxford University, leaving his best friend Fletch behind. Bailey went to Cardiff University to study philosophy and politics. “It’s not about me but the emotional journey is one that I’ve been on in the sense of coming to terms with where I’m from, where I exist and operate now, and how you marry those two. When you come from a place that is one thing, and are now in a place that is culturally different, how do you align those things in your head?” Bailey was born in Lewisham, south-east London. His parents split up when he was three and his mother raised him alone in Worcester, first working in a pub and then in the charity sector, while his father and stepmother ran a film company in Bristol. Most of his childhood was spent on the estate but he saw glimpses of another world on his trips to Bristol, and observing their work gave him a head start, he feels. He wasn’t sure if he would ever finish Sorry, You’re Not a Winner, after writing the opening scene, or that he wanted to continue working as a playwright at all. “I resisted going along this path until my mid 20s because I’d seen how difficult it was to make creative work.” He had not only seen his parents “struggling massively” to make ends meet but also strained to make enough money himself. Winning the Papatango prize changed that, and now, at the age of 32, he is juggling several commissions, including a film about a lower-league football team with The Full Monty director, Peter Cattaneo, and a TV series about a woman who infiltrates white nationalist terrorist cells based on Julia Ebner’s book Going Dark. With all the shifts in his life, is he still connected to his early life in Worcester? Very much so, he says. His mother still lives there and his childhood friends are important to him. “I’m godfather to two of their children. I was best man at one of their weddings … I’ve always valued those relationships very highly in terms of what they mean to me. But in terms of the way they live their lives and the way I live my life – they’ve got kids, they’ve been settled down for a long time, the structure of their lives is very different to mine.” What is essential for Bailey, in writing about the people with whom he grew up, is to represent them with integrity. “My first responsibility is to make sure this is a play they can come and see and enjoy. I never want to write a play about people back home and think that if they came to see it, they’d feel excluded. So I need to make sure the form and humour relates to who I’m writing about. Otherwise, you get into a position where it’s like, I’ve moved away from home and I’m going to take their stories and put them on stage for primarily middle-class audiences.” Sorry, You’re Not a Winner is at Theatre Royal Plymouth, 24 February to 12 March; Bristol Old Vic, 29 March to 2 April; and Northern Stage, Newcastle, 5 to 9 April.",Arts/Stage,Samuel Bailey: ‘I never want to write a play that excludes people back home’,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/21/samuel-bailey-i-never-want-to-write-a-play-that-excludes-people-back-home
2/22/2022,"Sweat pours down Josh Taylor’s face as the rope whirrs above his head and his feet blur beneath him. The best boxer in Britain, and one of the leading pound-for-pound fighters in the world, skips faster and faster in a stark and anonymous building in Harlow, Essex. We’re in the gym where Taylor has spent so much of the past two months preparing to defend his undisputed world light‑welterweight titles against Jack Catterall in Glasgow on Saturday. In his last bout, nine months ago, Taylor became the first British fighter, and the fifth man in boxing’s four-belt history, to win the WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO titles in his division. He defeated the previously unbeaten José Ramírez in a thrilling battle, twice knocking down the tough American on his way to a unanimous victory on points in Las Vegas.  Yet today, after a gruelling sparring session, Taylor howls in frustration when his feet get caught up in the rope and his frenetic skipping routine misses his target. He soon grins again as he resumes skipping and counting – only for the same thing to happen a minute later. This time there is also a mock wail of anguish because the rope hits his thigh with a real sting. Taylor rubs his leg while cursing cheerfully. The 31-year-old Scot has a perfect 18-0 record, and some compelling fights ahead of him if he beats Catterall, but he has grown used to not receiving the praise his boxing skills deserve. When we leave the gym a few hours later there are no surprised looks of recognition, or requests for selfies, from people walking past. No one even glances for long at Taylor who doesn’t seem bothered as he offers me a lift to the station. There is no need but it works as a reminder that Taylor still leads a relatively ordinary life despite his achievements. At least people who follow boxing closely are aware of Taylor’s spiteful talent in the ring and genuine relish for challenging contests. His status continues to grow in this small corner away from mainstream sport. “I think so,” he says. “It’s starting but, yeah, sometimes it’s a little frustrating. If I’d been someone else on a different platform, or from somewhere else, I’d have been all over the place.” Taylor shrugs when I ask why he has not been given the attention his exploits warrant. “I really don’t know. But I’m not in it for that anyway. I’m not a show pony. The achievement’s there and you can’t take away from what I’ve done. I don’t live for the adulation and the pats on the back. I’m doing it because I want to be the best in the sport.” Despite his landmark victory in 2021 he was ignored in the BBC’s annual sports review of the year. “I couldn’t give a monkey’s,” he says calmly. “But I thought I’d put out the point [on Twitter] that, in terms of sporting achievements and British boxing history, no one got anywhere near to what I achieved last year. To not even be mentioned or acknowledged was a bit funny and disrespectful. But I really couldn’t give a shit.” Josh Taylor reacts after not being nominated for the 2021 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award… pic.twitter.com/mj0UKU5KFv Taylor is ready for far harder tests and he suggests it would be better to risk defeat rather than avoid facing some of the greatest contemporary fighters in a weight category above him. The welterweight division is the best and most competitive and Terence Crawford and Errol Spence are probably in the top three pound‑for‑pound fighters in the world behind Canelo Álvarez. Crawford and Spence are yet to face each other and they are being chased by prodigious young American boxers such as Jaron “Boots” Ennis and Vergil Ortiz Jr. He needs to successfully defend his titles against Catterall but Taylor wants to move up and meet Crawford in an immensely dangerous fight. “If I can go my whole career without losing it would be absolutely fantastic but I don’t think it’s the be-all and end‑all,” he says. “I don’t think a loss defines any fighter. Look at the UFC where guys have had 20 fights and five or six losses. But they know that all the top guys can beat each other. That’s what boxing needs, even more so now after the Floyd Mayweather era where it became all about your unbeaten record. “A lot of fighters are trying to protect their records and it ruins the sport in terms of big fights not happening – or if they do happen it’s like Manny Pacquiao‑Mayweather, which was six years too late.” Crawford is his prime target but before we turn to the brooding and brilliant American I ask Taylor about Catterall, his mandatory challenger. The 28-year-old from Chorley had stepped aside 12 months ago so Taylor could face Ramírez in his unification battle. “We got that deal done after I gave my word that I would fight Jack next. I could have easily went for another fighter or moved up to welterweight. But I like to keep my word.” Catterall also has a pristine record, 26-0, but he has not faced the same calibre of opposition as the champion. I tell Taylor I recently heard Carl Frampton, his friend and former world featherweight champion, say that he only ever stayed behind to watch two fighters spar in the gym. Taylor was the first and Frampton spoke of how, after 10 pro fights, the Scot produced a masterclass in America when he sparred against a former world champion in Shawn Porter. “I remember getting quite nervous before that sparring session because it was Shawn Porter and I was just coming through. But I impressed everyone, including Porter. I knew how good I was at that point and that I was going to be a world champion. I knew I was world-class but I needed those sessions to really prove it to myself. I shocked Porter the first time because he wasn’t expecting much. But the next time he was really trying and I did really well.” Can Taylor guess the other fighter that Frampton loved to watch spar? “I’m not sure,” he says before, looking at me closely, he asks: “Jack Catterall? Yeah.” Is he surprised? “No. Carl told me that he’s quite talented, quite skilled. I see bits of Catterall’s skill set in his fights but he needs to do something very different against me.” When they have gone face to face has Taylor felt Catterall’s conviction that he can cause a shock and win in Glasgow? “I think so. If I was in his position, I know I would believe I could win. But I definitely picked up a bit of nervousness from him – the way he was acting and his body language. “I’ve not got any harsh feelings towards him yet because he comes across as a good, nice, respectful lad. But he’s standing in the way of my dreams and ambitions. The crowd is going to be well up for it and that gives me the butterflies and the buzz, the adrenaline rush that keeps you on your toes. I found it a lot harder the last couple of years boxing behind closed doors or in front of a very limited crowd.” His fight against Ramírez was affected by Covid restrictions but Taylor did not allow the muted Vegas atmosphere to affect him. All week he was a spiky and boisterous presence. “That was just my competitive nature coming out. There was no real animosity because you’re going in for a fight and the other guy’s trying to hurt you. It is violent but we’re going in there to do a job and we’re throwing punches with intent. You don’t want to cause any permanent damage but your mindset is to win the fight by hurting your opponent. It’s a vicious mindset. “I was in control most of the fight apart from in the third round when I switched off a little, made a mistake, and he had some success. But there were things we had been working on and I knocked him down in the sixth. I did the same in the next round with the uppercut. It was a real sweet one and he hit the canvas. He got up but I was in even more control. I thought I lost three rounds maximum. The judges’ scorecards were much closer and I thought they were really biased. But I never really needed to get into top gear.” The left uppercut that changed the course of the bout in the seventh round was a perfect punch and the memory makes Taylor smile. “It was a really good shot and even more satisfying because it was one we had worked on. We had watched Ramírez and we knew that the uppercut was going to work. He walked into them.” This @JoshTaylorBoxer uppercut in Round 7 was felt in the whole venue ... 🤯#RamirezTaylor | LIVE NOW on ESPN pic.twitter.com/wJVRzML7eF Ramírez is an excellent fighter but Crawford operates in a different dimension. Taylor knows his current obscurity in mainstream sporting terms would finally be overcome if he moved up a division and defeated Crawford. That ambition is his best way of gaining belated and sustained recognition for his boxing prowess. “If it goes the right way against Catterall I’ve achieved all I can at 140 pounds. “I always believe in improving and setting new goals so I’ve set my sights on becoming a two‑weight unified world champion. It’s definitely an achievable goal and this way it keeps my desire and fire burning to go down as an all-time great in British and world boxing.” Asked who he thinks would win a fight between the world’s two best welterweights, he says: “Spence is very good as well but Crawford’s on fire. I think he wins that one as he’s the best pound-for-pound fighter.” Even more than Canelo? “I think so. Crawford was the undisputed champion at 140, and he’s now unified champion at welterweight in a hot division. But if a fight with me happens I believe I’m 100% capable of winning. That’s the fight that would give me the fear factor and push me to new heights. Otherwise, if you don’t have that kind of challenge, you go stale.” Crawford and Taylor met in Las Vegas in November. “He was very respectful,” Taylor says. “We were both training at the Top Rank gym in the week of his fight [when Crawford stopped Porter] and I bumped into him and his team. He was cutting weight so you don’t want to get in his face. There was a little bit of sizing each other up but it was all respectful. He’s a really good guy and speaking to him I thought he’s a cool cat.” The sweat has dried on Taylor’s face. His problems with the skipping rope have long been forgotten and his anonymity in deepest Essex clearly does not irk him. His defining time, he believes, is coming. “Crawford is more than a cool dude,” he says. “He’s also a great fighter.” There is a fleeting pause and then, with a smile which is steely rather than relaxed, Taylor adds: “And so am I …”",Sport/Sport,Josh Taylor: ‘Terence Crawford is the fight that would give me the fear factor’ | Donald McRae,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/21/josh-taylor-terence-crawford-is-the-fight-that-would-give-me-the-fear-factor
