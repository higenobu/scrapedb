2/9/2022,"Jennifer Crumbley was having an affair while her son battled loneliness and often snuck off with her lover during breaks from work, a witness testified Tuesday during the preliminary exam for Jennifer and James Crumbley in 52/3 District Court in Rochester Hills. . Amanda Holland, who worked in the same real estate office as Jennifer Crumbley, said Jennifer Crumbley confided in her that she and her husband had marital issues and were contemplating a separation. She testified that both spouses had been seeing other people, and that Jennifer Crumbley told her that she saw another ""person"" during work hours in a parking lot across from the office. The Crumbleys, though, got back together. Holland said that around their anniversary, the couple took a casino trip and after returning home, decided to work things out. Holland is a witness for the prosecution in the Oxford High School shooting case. Her testimony bolsters the prosecution's allegations that Jennifer and James Crumbley ignored a troubled son who was spiraling out of control, and instead focused on their own selfish needs, including having extramarital affairs and taking care of their horses. Her testimony was part of a daylong preliminary exam during which a judge will decide whether there's enough evidence to order Jennifer and James Crumbley to stand trial. They are facing involuntary manslaughter charges for allegedly buying their son the gun that police say was used in the Nov. 30 shooting that killed four students and injured six other students and a teacher. Prosecutors also have alleged that the Crumbleys ignored many red flags that their son was depressed and needed help. Holland testified about some of those alleged red flags at the couple's preliminary exam, telling the court that Jennifer Crumbley had previously expressed concerns that her son would be lonely after his only friend moved away. She also testified that Jennifer Crumbley headed to a horse barn almost every day after work to check on her horses. Holland recalled her encounter with Jennifer Crumbley on the morning before the shooting, when school officials called the parents to the school about a troubling drawing their son had made. Ethan Crumbley had drawn a photo of a gun on a math homework sheet, along with the words: ""The thoughts won't stop. help me."" His parents refused to take him home, prosecutors have said, and the boy was allowed to return to class. When Jennifer Crumbley returned to work, Holland said she showed her the drawing of the gun. ""She said that she felt like a failure as a parent,"" Holland said. ""I told her I thought it was scary that he would draw that. She agreed."" On cross-examination, Holland noted that Jennifer Crumbley's comments about feeling like a failure ""seemed a little sarcastic."" Holland, who often overheard Jennifer Crumbley's phone conversations at work, testified that she never heard Jennifer Crumbley talk about taking her son to a doctor or a therapist. But she did hear her talk about her horses a lot. More: The Crumbleys are back in court — this time facing witnesses to the Oxford school shooting More: Witness: Jennifer Crumbley 'felt like a failure' as a mom to school shooting suspect On cross-examination from defense attorney Shannon Smith, Holland conceded that she and Jennifer Crumbley were not friends and talked mostly about little things. ""Jen didn't sit down with you and give you a play by play about their marriage, correct?"" Smith asked. ""Correct,"" Holland answered, but added, ""she went into detail about certain issues."" For example, Holland said, Jennifer Crumbley told her she was seeing someone else, and that she saw him during work hours. On cross-examination, Smith noted that Holland's knowledge of Ethan Crumbley was ""very limited,"" and that she was unaware of many things involving the school shooting. ""Were you aware that school officials told Jennifer that (Ethan) is not a threat to anyone?"" Smith asked, drawing a loud objection from the prosecution, which maintains the school never said that. Smith got the witness to acknowledge that much of her opinion is based on hindsight. For example, Holland testified that if Ethan Crumbley were her child, she would have brought him home from school after being found with that gun drawing. Smith noted that Holland, though, didn't call police herself and say, ""The parents didn’t do anything about this drawing."" ""This is hindsight,"" Smith told the witness. ""You know more now. ... You had no idea that a school shooting was going to take place after seeing that drawing on the math paper."" ""No I did not,"" Holland answered. That's precisely the argument that the defense has been making about the Crumbleys — that they had no way of knowing that their son was going to shoot up his school that day. Ethan Crumbley is facing terrorism and first-degree murder charges. His lawyers have said they are planning an insanity defense.

2/9/2022,"In March 2021, Vail Resorts gave the snow-sports world a shock: prices for its multi-resort season pass, called the Epic Pass, would be slashed by 20 percent, from $979 to $783. Its Epic Local Pass, which grants access to fewer resorts, would also see a price cut, from $729 to $583. ""We are excited to make it easier for everyone to move into a pass,"" Vail's then CEO Rob Katz said in a press release, ""and we remain fully committed to ensuring continuous improvements in the guest experience."" Thanks to the price cut, and to an impressive portfolio of 40 resorts worldwide, Vail sold 2.1 million pre-purchased tickets and season passes for 2021-22, a 76 percent jump over 2019-20 figures. As a result, earnings jumped 30 percent from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021. ""Vail Resorts took really aggressive pricing action this year on the Epic Pass, and that was undoubtedly going to trigger high sales,"" said Tom Foley, a ski-industry analyst and director of business intelligence at the travel research company Inntopia. ""I think it might have exceeded their expectations."" A Breckenridge, Colorado-based ski instructor who asked not to be named had a less generous assessment. Vail hasn't had the staff to support the huge crowds they brought in, he said. ""They left local resorts ill-equipped to deal with that burden."" Eleven months after announcing its record sales, Vail is mired in a seemingly endless barrage of complaints, social media vitriol, and negative news stories. Customers across its vast empire are lodging daily complaints about congestion, long chairlift lines, and reduced operations. Skiers at Washington's Stevens Pass have launched a petition to ask for a refund. Local newspapers have lambasted Vail for its drop in customer service. And across the internet, photos and humorous memes of Vail's huge crowds have generated tens of thousands of likes and comments. Vail has insisted that its deficiencies this season are a reflection of broader trends in the U.S. workforce, such as the housing crisis sweeping ski towns and the loss of labor due to the pandemic. And to be fair, 60 percent of the ski areas in the U.S. were unable to fill all open positions in the 2020-21 season, according to the National Ski Areas Association. But interviews with over a dozen current and former Vail employees suggest the economy and the ongoing pandemic aren't solely to blame. Vail's record sale of ski passes has played a part, they said. The company's dysfunctional internal policies, as well as its low wages, have also harmed its operating efficiency. According to these employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation, the company can be just as frustrating on the inside as it is in the lift lines. Eleven months after announcing its record sales, Vail is mired in a seemingly endless barrage of complaints, social media vitriol, and negative news stories. One of the criticisms sources repeated was Vail's ignoring feedback from its boots-on-the-ground employees, who have had a front-row seat for the problems on the slopes. ""It worries me that Vail isn't listening to their local people,"" said a snowboard instructor at Boston Mills, a 79-acre mountain in northeast Ohio that was acquired by Vail in 2019 as part of its much ballyhooed $264 million takeover of rival Peak Resorts and its 17 mountains. In the case of Boston Mills, locals were irritated when Vail shortened the ski day (the resort used to stay open until 11 P.M. but now closes at 5 P.M. on weekends) and expanded the terrain park, which took up space typically reserved for beginner runs, crowding the available easy terrain. That congestion is especially irksome, noted one Boston Mills instructor, on a small mountain that features low vertical: ""You're talking about a place that has 300 vertical feet. People don't drive two hours to ski all day here."" (Vail's vice president of communications Sara Olson says local staff at each resort make decisions about daily operations.) There's frustration among Boston Mills staff--and locals, for that matter--with Vail's inability to hire an adequate number of lift operators. The instructor blamed this on the position's low pay: the job was advertised as paying $11.25 an hour, and even after Vail announced in January an end-of-season bonus of $2 an hour, Boston Mills' wages are still far below, say, local amusement park Cedar Point's offering of $20 an hour for seasonal workers. (Cedar Point has apparently had no trouble finding workers.) The complaints extend far beyond Boston Mills. Employees and ex-employees at Vail properties, including Park City Mountain in Utah, Mount Snow in Vermont, Stevens Pass in Washington State, and Colorado's Beaver Creek and Breckenridge, all voiced frustrations with Vail's inability to hire seasonal workers. ""You could be a part-time retail associate and make a dollar more an hour than their starting wage for lift mechanics,"" said a Park City Mountain employee who works in on-mountain operations. ""They've given no incentive to stay at the company."" ""We have a lot of well-trained, qualified instructors who are making less than burger flippers at fast-food joints,"" added a ski instructor at Breckenridge. (In an emailed statement to Outside, Olson said that Vail ""made a significant investment"" in wages and highlighted ""the $2/hour bonus added to our employees' compensation for the rest of the season."") For a company that boasts annual revenues just shy of $2 billion and controls a lion's share of national skier visits (and, as a publicly traded company, has a fiduciary duty to shareholders), these may seem like small-scale problems. And Vail recently announced major improvements to many of its resorts, including a $320 million plan to build 21 new chairlifts across 14 resorts next season. But employees say that Vail's wages are well below livable, especially in mountain towns experiencing soaring real estate prices and ever more second homes and vacation rentals. In addition to wages, employees were concerned by what they see as a one-size-fits-all approach to resort management as well as by Vail's ongoing efforts to ""centralize corporate functions"" through its headquarters in Broomfield, Colorado, as the company wrote in a 2019 statement. This process has included laying off members of resort marketing, finance, and human-resource teams over the last several years. But employees say that such centralization has created confusion and left mountains lacking key institutional knowledge. One former Peak Resorts employee who worked in the marketing department said that soon after Vail's acquisition, resort general managers felt they had less say over day-to-day operations--""what to groom, where to make snow, when to make snow."" Instead, regional directors and corporate employees in Broomfield took over decision-making. ""A lot of those regional directors and people in Broomfield weren't really familiar with the intricacies of operating a ski resort in the Midwest or the East Coast, which need snowmaking early and often to maintain a proper snow surface,"" the employee said. ""They were used to snowmaking conditions like you find in Colorado, where you just make snow up until the Christmas holiday and then you stop because it's supplemented by natural snow."" As a result, the employee said, Vail's new acquisitions have seen a slower opening schedule. Vail spokespeople say that an unusually balmy winter led to delays in opening trails to the public this year. ""Regarding delayed openings of our resorts--that was the result of weather,"" said Olson, Vail's VP of communications. ""At some resorts, like Park City Mountain, we had temperatures in the fifties and sixties which is not conducive to even snowmaking. At others, like our Tahoe Resorts, the warm early season was followed by massive amounts of snow that took days to dig out from to ensure the terrain was safe to ski and ride on."" Vail's CEO, Kirsten Lynch, who was appointed to the role in November, added: ""The early months of this ski and ride season were challenging for a variety of reasons, and I am proud of the tremendous work of all our teams who reacted quickly to execute improvements across our resorts. We now have nearly 100 percent of our terrain open at our ten largest resorts, with great progress at our regional and local resorts as well. Our goal is always to provide our guests an amazing experience and I am confident we have a great season ahead of us."" Critics, however, point out that warm weather didn't stop many of its rival resorts. ""When the independent resorts have 50 percent of their terrain open, the Vail resorts have 20 percent of their terrain open,"" said the former Peak employee. ""They're all in the same climate.""  In Ohio, for example, Boston Mills didn't open for the season until January 7, while Snow Trails in Mansfield (about an hour's drive away) was open before Christmas. And though Stevens Pass opened on December 15, by mid-January about 60 percent of the terrain was still inaccessible--an unusually high percentage compared to other Washington resorts, which had most of their serviceable terrain open by then.  Employees also expressed dismay over the removal of on-site human-resources departments in favor of an outsourced web-based system--another casualty of Vail's centralized approach--as a major pain point. Workers say it has caused a number of headaches. In one case, a ski instructor in Colorado offered to lend money to direct reports who were unable to reach anyone on the corporate team when their paychecks weren't processed on time. Vail says the new system makes HR support available daily. However, some employees expressed challenges getting in contact with HR, citing slow response times. ""The dismissal of [individual] HR departments made it clear that they don't care about employees,"" added the Park City employee, explaining that the outsourced system is far less expedient. ""HR now takes two to four days to reply."" (Olson, Vail's communications VP, said: ""We centralized our HR function to ensure consistency, scalability and best-in-class support across all of our resorts--which has been invaluable as we navigate this pandemic."") Employees suggested these internal problems, when matched with the low wages, make Vail less able to hire and retain new workers. ""The past ten or 15 years there's been a gradual acceleration of devaluing employees,"" said a Beaver Creek ski instructor. ""Vail has these core values: serve others, do right, be inclusive, drive value, do good, be safe, and have fun. Most of their core values they are not living up to."" Conversations with customers from multiple Vail-owned resorts show an exasperated clientele who have had to wait in lift lines for upwards of 30 minutes and face delayed terrain openings. ""This year has been horrible,"" said Jon Sleep, a skier at Stevens Pass, where closed terrain--despite snowy conditions--has prompted mass complaints from customers. ""Other resorts in my area are operating like normal."" (Vail has said that lift lines at its resorts were under a ten-minute wait time 90 percent of the time during the holiday.) Boston Mills skier Heather Johnston Welliver said the long wait times are especially vexing, since that resort is so small. ""I have kids and I want them to grow up skiing, just like I did,"" she said. ""They don't love getting on all their gear and going to wait in lines that are 20 minutes long to go down the hill for 30 seconds."" Vail's attempts to solve its lingering lift-line problem--launching a daily forecast of wait times in its app and implementing ""phone free zones"" in lift lines to make sure people aren't distracted and further exacerbating the problem--have proven largely unsuccessful, employees say. There is at least one source of hope: growing calls for accountability from mountain-town and ski-area locals. Ski-patrol unions in Breckenridge, Park City, and Stevens Pass reached contract agreements with Vail in the last few months. Other movements have been more grassroots, relying on social media and public comment to share grievances and demand action. In early January, Stevens Pass local Jeremy Hunter Rubingh drafted a petition on Change.org that claims Vail not only failed customers but might also be in violation of the Washington Consumer Protection Act because it ""deceived a substantial portion of the public"" by selling passes while always ""[intending] to keep 60 percent of the terrain and the majority of lifts closed for the season."" To date, the petition has racked up nearly 44,000 signatures, prompted other mountain communities to create petitions of their own, and caught the attention of the state's attorney general after the office received over 80 complaints about the ski area. ""This was about being pro-worker and about being pro-skier, pro-snowboarder,"" Rubingh told me. ""This is about getting some positive changes, getting terrain opened, getting people paid. I think that's why it resonated. It wasn't just like, 'We're pissed, we hate Vail.' It was like, 'No, this is what it should be. Let's do something.'"" At least with Stevens Pass, Vail has acknowledged its mistakes. In early January the resort replaced its general manager; two weeks later, it offered next season's pass at the discounted price of $385 and finally opened up much of its closed terrain. (Olson, Vail's VP of communications, added that it has made improvements in both staffing and terrain in the last few weeks, with 85 percent of the mountain now open.) Rubingh has mixed feelings about Vail's attempts at extending an olive branch. ""It's these specific business practices that have left Vail Resorts behind compared to other resorts,"" he said. ""Everyone has been hit by the pandemic. But why is it that it was so exacerbated with Vail Resorts' properties?"" Not all of the grassroots campaigns have been so diplomatic. In March 2021, after Vail announced the price slash on its Epic Passes, Alex Kaufman, a Colorado-based skier who spent two decades working at resorts across the U.S., had a feeling that conditions were about to deteriorate. For $12, Kaufman bought the domain name epicliftlines.com; he then created a corresponding Instagram account. Kaufman's premonition was, of course, all too accurate, and soon people--39,000 of them and counting--began flocking to his fledgling Instagram to air their grievances. ""This thing kind of blew up by basically just holding up a mirror to what was going on,"" said Kaufman. Kaufman pointed to a recent Wall Street Journal story about Vail's troubles as evidence that this social media uproar might be inspiring real-world change. (And indeed Wall Street has taken notice: Vail's stock has dropped 26.86 percent over the last three months, from $372.51 on November 5 to $272.44 on January 28.) ""In the article, I saw the word pivot come out of the CEO's mouth,"" Kaufman said, referencing a seemingly trivial line in the Journal's reporting, where Kirsten Lynch said Vail would be ""willing to hear and change and pivot."" ""That's been the most important thing,"" Kaufman said. ""Now, every analyst on every call is going to be asking her about how the pivot is going.""",Business/Outside,"Vail Resorts Sold a Record Number of Passes.

2/9/2022,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A large bull moose spent more than an hour stomping on the sled dog team of a rookie Iditarod musher in the wilds of Alaska last week — and the attack didn't end even after Bridgett Watkins emptied her gun into the animal. She said on Facebook Friday that the moose, after seriously injuring four of her dogs, wouldn't leave and that the ordeal stopped only after she called friends for help and one showed up with a larger caliber gun and killed the moose. “This has been the most horrific past 24 hours of my life,” she posted after the Thursday moose attack on the Salcha River trail system near Fairbanks. Watkins wrote that the attack, first reported by the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, happened while she was on a 52-mile (83.7-kilometer) training run for the nearly 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. It starts March 5 in Anchorage. ""As he charged me I emptied my gun into him and he never stopped,” she wrote on Facebook. “I ran for my life and prayed I was fast enough to not be killed in that moment. He trampled the team and then turned for us.” Watkins, who didn’t immediately respond to messages Tuesday to The Associated Press, said she and a friend who was trailing her on a snowmobile took refuge next to the snowmobile. The moose stopped its charge toward them about 2 feet (0.6 meters) from the snowmobile and she managed to cut free six dogs that were tied to the machine. But the moose went back to her sled and began stomping the dogs that were still tethered to it — standing over the dogs and trampling them repeatedly for over an hour. “I have never felt so helpless in my life,” Watkins wrote. “He would not leave us alone and he even stood over top of the team refusing to retreat.” She called friends and the moose was shot and killed after one arrived with a rifle. Alaska State Troopers had been preparing a helicopter to respond but stopped doing so after they were told the moose was dead, agency spokesperson Tim DeSpain said in an email. Her four injured dogs were taken to a veterinarian in the nearby community of North Pole and are recovering, Watkins posted. Watkins, a native of Arkansas who moved to Alaska when she was 5, is no stranger to mushing or its dangers. Her father and step-mother are well-known mushers Allen Moore and Aliy Zirkle. In the 2016 Iditarod, Zirkle and four-time winner Jeff King were attacked by a man on a snowmobile near the community of Nulato. One dog on King’s team was killed and two others were injured. Another famous tale of a musher’s run-in with an angry moose happened in the 1985 Iditarod — when the late Susan Butcher came across one while she was leading the race. She used her ax and a parka to fight off the moose, but it killed two of her dogs and injured 13 others. Another musher came along and killed the moose. She had to withdraw from the race, but later won four Iditarod races. Butcher died in 2006 from leukemia at age 51. Watkins posted that she managed to start training with her dogs again on Monday and had advice after her moose encounter: “Carry a bigger gun.” Meat from the moose that attacked her dogs was donated to charity.",U.S./Associated Press,"Moose attacks Iditarod rookie's sled team, injures 4 dogs",https://news.yahoo.com/moose-attacks-iditarod-rookies-sled-211549158.html
2/9/2022,"President Biden on Tuesday acknowledged Tesla as the country's ""largest electric vehicle manufacturer."" For months, Biden has faced calls to include Tesla in the national EV conversation. CEO Elon Musk has been critical of the president for boosting Ford and GM while leaving out Tesla. President Joe Biden on Tuesday called Tesla the country's ""largest electric vehicle manufacturer"" after facing repeated calls to acknowledge the company as a leader in the automotive and clean energy industries. During a speech focused on boosting domestic electric vehicle manufacturing, Biden spoke of Tesla's influence in the industry — a departure from his usual praise for legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors. The president mentioned that over $200 billion in manufacturing investments have been greenlit by companies since last year — while also announcing that the Australian company Tritium would construct a new plant in Tennessee and produce up to 30,000 electric vehicle chargers annually. ""Since 2021, companies have announced investments totaling more than $200 billion in domestic manufacturing here in America,"" he said. ""From iconic companies like GM and Ford, building out new electric vehicle production [facilities], to Tesla, our nation's largest electric vehicle manufacturer, to innovative, younger companies like Rivian, building electric trucks, or ProTerra, building electric buses."" —Cheddar News 🧀 (@cheddar) February 8, 2022 In late January, a Change.org petition was launched to prod Biden to say ""Tesla"" and include the company in his push for electric vehicle manufacturing throughout the country. The petition has since received nearly 59,000 signatures. For months, Tesla CEO Elon Musk criticized Biden for not including the company in the larger national conversation about electric vehicles. After Biden tweeted last month that ""companies like GM and Ford are building more electric vehicles here at home than ever before"" while appearing with General Motors CEO Mary Barra, Musk responded to his company's absence from the discussion. ""Starts with a T, Ends with an A, ESL in the middle,"" he wrote. Musk has been critical of Biden in the past, calling for lawmakers to tank the Build Back Better Act — the seemingly doomed Democratic-led social-spending framework — while also stating that the president was ""controlled by unions."" The chief executive's opinion of Biden has deteriorated markedly since last year. At the start of Biden's presidency in January 2021, Musk told Fortune that he was amped up about the new administration's push to tackle climate change. ""I'm super fired up that the new administration is focused on climate,"" he said at the time.

2/9/2022,"If you get knocked down with COVID any time soon, you'll almost certainly be dealing with the Omicron variant. This version of the virus is estimated to account for more than 99 percent of new infections in the U.S., edging out the formerly dominant Delta variant almost completely, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Omicron has a number of mutations that make it different from past iterations of COVID, including how fast it spreads and the severity of the infection it produces. But these mutations also appear to be shifting the type of symptoms people infected with the coronavirus should expect. Now, doctors say Omicron is producing pain in two places that weren't commonly reported with past variants. Read on to find out what new sign of COVID you should be looking out for. RELATED: I'm Boosted and Got Omicron—This Was My Worst Symptom by Far. When doctors in South Africa and other countries first started reporting on the differing symptoms of patients who had come down with a new variant called Omicron, muscle ache or pain—also referred to as myalgia—was a common complaint. Now Gavi, a global vaccine alliance organization, says myalgia is one of the top signs of this variant people should be watching out for. ""People will tell us they went to bed last night [and say that] they felt warm and cold during the night, [and wake up with] body aches and pain, chest pain, or backache and fatigue—that's Omicron,"" Angelique Coetzee, a South African doctor and chair of the South African Medical Association (SAMA), explained to MSNBC. While a coronavirus infection has potential to cause hurt anywhere in your body, there are two particular spots that could be indicative of Omicron. According to the U.K. Zoe COVID Study App, many people who complain about muscle aches with a COVID case feel that pain in the legs and shoulders. The U.K. National Health Service (NHS) says that pain in these two body parts can manifest in a variety of ways when the underlying cause is the coronavirus. ""Some people have widespread aching that can come and go for a time as you recover. Some people also have odd or altered feelings such as numbness or pins and needles and weakness in the legs,"" the agency states. In terms of your shoulders, the NHS says that problems can include a ""combination of pain, stiffness, numbness,"" or even weakness. RELATED: For more up-to-date information, sign up for our daily newsletter. Myalgia is common in many viral infections and COVID is no exception, Harish Chafle, a senior consultant for Pulmonology and Critical Care at Global Hospital in Parel, Mumbai, told Livemint. But the medical expert said that it's clear that body pain is occurring more often with the Omicron variant, which could be a result of a number of different factors. ""It is a possibility that due to inflammatory mediators this variant is causing more myalgia than any other variant post-recovery,"" Chafle said. ""Another reason for this can be the fact that this variant is affecting the musculoskeletal system more than any other variant before."" Coetzee also told MSNBC that she believes body pain is more apparent with Omicron because it is more likely to attack the musculoskeletal system first, impacting muscles, bones, joints, and ligaments with aches and pains. There's no doubt that pain in the legs and shoulders—amid other potential places—is popping up more often with Omicron compared to prior variants of the virus. But body pain is still not considered one of the top five signs of infection from this variant. According to the Zoe COVID Study App, the most common symptoms of the Omicron variant are runny nose, headache, fatigue, sneezing, and sore throat. There are also not really any signs of former telltale COVID symptoms like shortness of breath or loss of taste and smell. ""A lot of the Omicron symptoms, the majority of them are looking like the common cold or some other viral illness, without any of the classic symptoms,"" Tim Spector, founder of the Zoe COVID Study App, said in a statement.
