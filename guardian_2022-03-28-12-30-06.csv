3/28/2022,"Will Smith has won the Oscar for best actor at the 94th Academy Awards, currently under way at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles. Smith won the prize for his role as Richard Williams, father of tennis champions Venus and Serena Williams, in King Richard, a biopic that outlined Williams’ role in the sisters’ stellar success. The film was directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green and stars Smith in the title role, alongside Aunjanue Ellis as his wife Brandy, Saniyya Sidney and Demi Singleton as Venus and Serena, and Jon Bernthal as tennis coach Rick Macci. Venus and Serena Williams acted as executive producers on the project. Smith had already been responsible for the evening’s major drama after he appeared to hit presenter Chris Rock after he made a joke about Smith’s wife, Jada-Pinkett-Smith. “Take my wife’s name out of your fucking mouth,” he yelled at Rock, twice. In the advert breaks, Smith could be seen wiping tears from his eyes and being comforted by others in the room. Taking to the stage, Smith addressed the controversy with reference to the character he played in King Richard. “Oh man,” he said. “Richard Williams was a fierce defender of his family. In this time in my life, in this moment, I am overwhelmed by what God is calling on me to do and be in this world. “Making this film I got to protect Aunjanue Ellis, who is one of the strongest, most delicate people I’ve ever met. I got to protect Saniyya Sidney and Demi Singleton, the two actresses who played Venus and Serena. “I’m being called on in my life to love people and to protect people and to be a river to my people. And I know we do what we do you and gotta be able to take abuse and have people talk crazy about you. In this business, people abuse you and you gotta smile and pretend like that’s ok. “I wanna be a vessel for love, I wanna say thank you to Venus and Serena and the entire Williams family for entrusting me with your story. I wanna be an ambassador for that kind of love and care and concern. “I wanna apologise to the Academy and to all my fellow nominees. This is beautiful moment and I’m crying for winning an award. It’s not about winning an award for me it’s about being able to shine a light on all of the people, the entire cast and crew.” Continuing to wipe away tears, Smith said: “Art imitates life! I looked like the crazy father, just like they said. But love will make you do crazy things.” Smith finished by thanking his mother, who he said couldn’t attend as she was busy with her knitting cirlce. “Thank you for this moment,” he concluded. “I hope the Academy invites me back.” Smith has already won numerous awards for his role in the film, including best actor at the Bafta and Critics Choice awards, and best actor (drama) at the Golden Globes. At the Oscars, Smith has been successful at the third attempt, having been nominated twice before for best actor: for Ali in 2002 and The Pursuit of Happyness in 2007.",Arts/Film,Will Smith wins best actor Oscar for King Richard,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/will-smith-wins-best-actor-oscar-for-king-richard
3/28/2022,"Jane Campion has won the Oscar for best director at the 94th Academy Awards, currently under way at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles. Campion becomes the third woman to win the award, after Chloé Zhao in 2021 and Kathryn Bigelow in 2010. Campion won the award for the western The Power of the Dog, which stars Benedict Cumberbatch, Jesse Plemons, Kodi Smit-McPhee and Kirsten Dunst; it is adapted from the 1967 novel by Thomas Savage about two brothers whose relationship deteriorates when one of them gets married. Taking to the stage amid a standing ovation, Campion paid tribute to her fellow nominees, her cast and crew and the “whole awesome team” at Netflix. She also thanked her daughter and partner, and the author Thomas Savage, who wrote the 1967 novel on which her film is based. “He wrote about cruelty,” said Campion, “wanting the opposite – kindness.” Campion has already won a string of prizes for the film, including best director at the Baftas, Golden Globes and Directors Guild of America awards, and the Silver Lion prize for best director at the Venice film festival. This is her second Oscar win, having taken the best original screenplay award in 1994 for The Piano; she was nominated for best director for the same film but lost to Steven Spielberg for Schindler’s List. Spielberg’s nomination this year made him the first director nominated over six decades.",Arts/Film,Jane Campion wins best director Oscar for The Power of the Dog,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/jane-campion-wins-best-director-oscar-for-the-power-of-the-dog
3/28/2022,"Will Smith appeared to slap presenter Chris Rock for joking about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, at the Oscars. During the third hour of the telecast, Rock took the stage to present the award for best documentary, and cracked a joke about Pinkett-Smith as being in GI Jane 2 – seemingly a reference to her shaved head. (Pinkett-Smith has been open in the past about suffering from alopecia, a condition that causes hair loss.) Smith then said “Keep my wife’s name out of your fucking mouth” twice as the telecast glitched for American viewers. Smith then rushed the stage, where he struck Rock, footage of which was captured on uncensored international telecasts. It’s unclear if the move was a bit or a genuine surprise. “Wow, Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me,” Rock said. VIA JAPANESE TELEVISION: The uncensored exchange between Will Smith and Chris Rock pic.twitter.com/j0Z184ZyXa This is not the first time Rock has brought up Pinkett-Smith at the Oscars. In 2016, the last time Rock hosted the ceremony, he said: “Jada Pinkett Smith boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihanna’s panties – I wasn’t invited!” Adding fuel to the fire, Scott Feinberg, a Hollywood Reporter critic in attendance at the ceremony, tweeted that “during the commercial break, Will Smith is pulled aside and comforted by Denzel Washington and Tyler Perry, who motion for him to brush it off. Will appears to wipe tears from his eyes as he sits back down with Jada, with Denzel comforting Jada and Will’s rep by his side.” The moment became immediate fodder for memes as a confused virtual audience tried to parse what, exactly, went down. “i know what needs to be taken to the red table …” tweeted writer Hunter Harris, referring to Pinkett-Smith’s Facebook Live talk show. “Suddenly Chris rock shows up in the in memoriam,” tweeted writer Broti Gupta. Some pointed to the shocked reaction of Lupita Nyong’o, seated behind the Smiths. LUPITA IN THE BEHIND WILL SMITH IS KILLING ME #AcademyAwards pic.twitter.com/BtITt6SC4R Congratulations to ""via Japanese television"" and ""via Australian television"" for jointly winning this year's Best Picture Oscar Later in the evening, Smith won best actor for his role as Richard Williams, father to Venus and Serena, in King Richard. The 53-year-old actor praised the real inspiration for his character as “a fierce defender of his family” to whoops from the audience. “I’m being called on in my life to love people and to protect people and to be a river to my people,” he said. “I know to do what we do you’ve got to be able to take abuse, and have people talk crazy about you and have people disrespecting you and you’ve got to smile and pretend it’s OK,” he added, seeming to confirm that the incident with Rock was not scripted but derived from genuine hurt. Smith said just before his win, Denzel Washington told him: “At your highest moment, be careful, that’s when the devil comes for you.” “I want to be a vessel for love,” Smith said through tears. “I want to be an ambassador of that kind of love and care and concern. I want to apologise to the Academy and all my fellow nominees. “I look like the crazy father just like they said about Richard Williams, but love will make you do crazy things,” he continued. He concluded his speech with thanks and hopes that the Academy “will invite me back”.",Arts/Film,Will Smith appears to hit Chris Rock over joke at Oscars,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/27/will-smith-punch-chris-rock-wife-joke-gi-jane-video-oscars
