2/6/2022,"A former Navy captain pleaded guilty to accepting nearly $68,000 in bribes from a foreign contractor. Donald Hornbeck accepted dinners, parties, and sex workers from businessman Leonard Glenn Francis. The ""Fat Leonard"" bribery scandal has led to the indictment of dozens of military officials. A former Navy captain pleaded guilty to bribery on Wednesday for accepting nearly $68,000 in luxury hotel rooms, dinners, alcohol-fueled parties, and sex workers from a Singapore-based defense contractor. In his plea agreement, Donald Hornbeck, 61, admitted to accepting the gifts from Malaysian businessman Leonard Glenn Francis, nicknamed ""Fat Leonard."" In exchange, Hornbeck shared confidential information with Francis and helped steer Seventh Fleet business to ports servicesd by Francis' ship husbanding company that serviced US Navy ships in the Asia Pacific region. Authorities say that Francis overbilled the Navy over the years by over $35 million. According to the Department of Justice, Francis picked up the bill for Hornbeck and others in Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Japan, and Bangkok, Thailand, treating them to luxury hotels and lavish dinners of Wagyu beef lobster and caviar in top restaurants. In May 2008, in Manilla, the Philippines, he paid for a ""multi-day party"" that included sex workers. Earlier that month, Francis hosted dinner at Mezza9 in Singapore, after which, Francis arranged for several sex workers to entertain Hornbeck and others, said the DOJ. The following day, Hornbeck emailed Francis to say thank you for a fantastic dinner. ""Also really enjoyed my new Mongolian Friend,"" a reference to a sex worker, to which Francis noted: ""Hot Mongolian [B]arbeque Ribs!"" ""While scores of Navy officials were partying with Leonard Francis, a massive breach of national security was in full swing,"" US Attorney Randy Grossman said in a statement. ""Today, another participant has admitted that he lost his way, allowing greed to replace honor and duty as the driving force in his life."" Hornbeck's guilty plea is the latest in a sprawling Navy bribery and corruption scandal, which has led to the indictment of 34 military officials, of which 29 have pleaded guilty. Leonard Glenn Francis, the Malaysian businessman at the heart of the scandal, pleaded guilty in 2015 to $500,000 in bribes but has yet to be sentenced. Hornbeck faces up to 15 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 at his sentencing on September 8. He was one of nine members of the US Navy's Seventh Fleet indicted by a federal grand jury in March 2017 for conspiring with Francis and receiving bribes, and the fourth to plead guilty. Leonard Glenn Francis is reportedly set to appear as a star witness for the prosecution in the criminal trial of six naval officers due to begin in February 2022. He has also previously claimed that he secretly videotaped Navy officers with sex workers he recruited.

2/6/2022,"Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) on Friday urged former Vice President Mike Pence to wake up, step up and tell the full truth about Donald Trump, the former president’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election result and his involvement in the deadly U.S. Capitol riot. Pence is already a pariah in the GOP for refusing to choose Trump over democracy and has nothing to lose, Raskin argued on MSNBC’s “All In With Chris Hayes.” Pence drew criticism from MAGA Republicans this week after he said Trump was “wrong” to claim Pence could have single-handedly overturned President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Pence’s “very legalistic” commentary on Trump and Jan. 6 could be an effort to curry favor with the former president’s base, said Raskin. “But they hate Pence more than they hate me,” the Democratic congressman cracked. “They were calling him a traitor on that day. They were chanting, ‘Hang Mike Pence!’” he said, giving Pence a reality check. “Pence should wake up and understand that our whole constitutional democracy is under attack now, and Donald Trump is indeed the threat. Does he think that was sort of a one-day lapse in the otherwise good behavior of Donald Trump?” Watch the interview here: This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated. GOP Sen.

2/6/2022,"(Reuters) - Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said on Saturday it was fraud for GoFundMe to ""commandeer"" $9 million in donations sent to support protesting truckdrivers in Canada and that he will investigate what he called ""deceptive practices"" by the website. GoFundMe took down the so-called Freedom Convoy's page on Friday, saying it violated its terms of service. It said donors had two weeks to request a refund, then remaining funds would be disbursed to ""credible and established charities."" DeSantis, a Republican, said on Twitter it was fraud for GoFundMe to give the money ""to causes of their own choosing,"" and he would work with Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody to investigate. ""(T)hese donors should be given a refund."" GoFundMe did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on DeSantis' tweet. In a Twitter post, the company said on Saturday that ""due to donor feedback"" it was simplifying the process and will be refunding all donations to the Freedom Convoy 2022 fundraiser. ""This refund will happen automatically — you do not need to submit a request. Donors can expect to see refunds within 7-10 business days,"" GoFundMe said in a tweet. The convoy began as a movement against a vaccine requirement for cross-border truckers, but has turned into a rallying point against public health measures. Protesters have shut down downtown Ottawa for eight days, with some participants waving Confederate or Nazi flags and some saying they wanted to dissolve Canada's government. Cities including the financial hub Toronto braced for disruptions on Saturday as protests spread from Ottawa, raising fears of clashes with counter protesters.

2/6/2022,"Doski Azad, a 23-year-old trans woman, was found dead on Monday in Iraqi Kurdistan, police said. Her estranged brother was the only suspect in the alleged honor killing, police said. Family members had previously threatened to kill Azad for being trans, a close friend told Insider. Doski Azad didn't turn up to a scheduled meeting, which was out of character, one of her friends told Insider. The 23-year-old transgender woman, a makeup artist in Iraq's Kurdistan Region, was usually very reliable, she said. The friend knew something was up, but she couldn't have anticipated the shocking call she received two days later. ""I found out Doski was brutally murdered,"" she said. Azad's body was found on Monday afternoon in a village on the outskirts of Duhok. She had been shot in the head and chest, a day or two before the corpse was discovered, Dohuk police said. An image reviewed by Insider showed that Azad's hands had been tied together, and her body had been left in a shallow ditch. Police became aware of the body's whereabouts after a tipoff from a relative, the Kurdish media outlet Rudaw reported. The same relative told police that it was a sibling who had killed her, the report said. Her estranged brother Chakdar, who spent the past eight years living in western Europe, is the only suspect in the murder, police said on Kurdish television. People familiar with the matter told Insider that he traveled to the Kurdistan Region in Iraq with the sole intent of murdering his sister. The murder is being described as an ""honor killing,"" and discrimination was ""undoubtedly"" at the root of it, the US Consulate General in Erbil said on Thursday. —U.S. Consulate General Erbil (@USConGenErbil) February 3, 2022 Azad had a difficult relationship with her family after she came out as trans years ago, a close friend who wished to remain anonymous told Insider. Being a traditional family in a religiously conservative area meant that many relatives chose not to accept her, the friend said. She added, ""Some of her family threatened to kill her a few times."" Fearful for her safety, Azad left her family home five years ago and moved into an apartment by herself in Dohuk city center. There, she worked as a makeup artist at a local salon, had many friends, and wanted to live an ordinary life, her friend said. ""She was a peaceful and popular person who never wanted to see anyone sad,"" she added. But years after moving out, Azad continued to receive sporadic bursts of transphobic abuse from her brother and a cousin. IraQueer, an Iraqi LGBTQ advocacy group, said Azad notified the organization several times that she was being harassed by her relatives. Azad's friend said that while she was aware of the abuse, Azad's murder still came as a shock to her and those who knew Azad. ""When I found out, I laughed a lot and thought it was a lie,"" the friend said. ""I tried to call Doski, but she did not answer. Then I tried to tell my friends, and I collapsed and broke down."" Azad's ""honor killing"" was motivated by transphobia, which is prevalent in Iraq, an activist with IraQueer told Insider. ""Her brother came and he killed her because she broke the rules of patriarchy,"" said the activist, who asked to remain anonymous. ""In the Iraqi concepts of community and manhood, you cannot give up on your masculinity to become a woman because that is seen as degrading."" Honor killings are a practice in which people, seemingly seeking to protect the dignity of their families, murder their family members, primarily women or girls. But members of LGBTQ communities are also targeted, particularly in homophobic societies. Insider reported on the honor killing of Alireza Fazeli Monfared, a young gay man in Iran, who was murdered last year. Pishkoo Zandi, a human-rights activist, told Insider that these sorts of murders usually go unreported in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region because queer people are treated as invisible. ""The governmental system is homophobic, and the media is homophobic, too,"" Zandi said. ""They don't want to say anything about us."" Kurdish media reported that a transgender person was killed by family members in July. But Zandi said police didn't carry out an investigation or arrest anyone. Insider understands that police are investigating the murder of Azad, and officers believe her brother has fled to Belgium, Germany, or Turkey. Two people familiar with the situation told Insider that Kurdish police were cooperating with Interpol, the international organization that facilitates worldwide police cooperation, to locate and arrest him. Duhok police did not respond to Insider's request to confirm this. Interpol said it was unable to comment on specific cases except in special circumstances and with the approval of the country concerned. But while the search for Azad's brother is underway, her friends are struggling to come to terms with how such a terrible thing could have happened to such a good person. ""Doski would never hurt anybody,"" her close friend said. ""Not even her family."" Read the original article on Insider",World/INSIDER,"Doski Azad wanted to live life as a trans woman in Iraq.

2/6/2022,"Pamela Moses became permanently ineligible to vote after pleading guilty in 2015 to two felonies Memphis activist Pamela Moses has been sentenced to six years and one day in prison for illegally registering to vote in 2019. Moses, 44, was convicted in November 2021 for the crime of registering to vote with a felony conviction on her record, Newsweek reports. She became permanently ineligible to vote in Tennessee after pleading guilty in 2015 to two felonies as well as three misdemeanors and was placed on probation for seven years. At the time, she was reportedly charged with tampering with evidence and forgery, perjury, stalking, theft under $500, and escape. Moses, who founded Black Lives Matter Memphis, has maintained that she believed her voting rights had been restored in 2019. The sentencing judge accused her of deceiving officials. “I did not falsify anything. All I did was try to get my rights to vote back the way the people at the election commission told me and the way the clerk did,” she said during her sentencing hearing on Jan. 26, WREG-TV Memphis reported. “You tricked the probation department into giving you documents saying you were off probation,” said Judge Mark Ward. “After you were convicted of a felony in 2015, you voted six times as a convicted felon.” Moses explained in an interview with The Guardian last year that her saga began after her 2015 guilty plea, and she wasn’t informed that she had become ineligible to vote. “They never mentioned anything about voting. They never mentioned anything about not voting, being able to vote…none of that,” she told the U.K. news outlet. Per The Guardian report, the court failed to notify election officials to remove Moses from the voter rolls. Moses would find this out in 2018 when she attempted to run as a candidate for mayor of Memphis but was informed by election officials that she couldn’t appear on the ballot due to her criminal record. That’s when Moses consulted a judge, who informed her that she was still on probation. Moses decided that the judge miscalculated her sentence, and she seemingly convinced her probation officer as much, because the individual incorrectly signed official documents stating Moses’ probation had ended, according to the report Election officials received an email a day later from the corrections department informing them of the probation officer’s error and that Moses was still ineligible to vote due to her active felony sentence. She never actually voted, but simply registered — something she thought she could do. “I was convicted of altering a document that I didn’t even sign,” she told reporters. Moses was charged for falsely asserting that her probation had expired when she filed a certificate of restoration and application for voter registration with the Shelby County Election Commission, Fox News reports. “Pamela Moses, a Black woman, has been sentenced to six years in prison because of a voting error. Meanwhile, white individuals who are known to have committed blatant voter fraud have only received probation,” the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund said in a statement on Twitter.
