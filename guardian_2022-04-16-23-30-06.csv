4/16/2022,"After the disruption of the pandemic, Helen Fields knew this Easter holiday would be a crucial time for her sons to revise for their GCSE and A-level exams. Instead, 16-year-old Solomon caught Covid and has been too unwell to concentrate, and 18-year-old Gabriel is suffering “serious anxiety”, having never sat high-stakes exams. Summer term starts this week for many, but the Association of School and College Leaders union (ASCL) told the Observer that the first public exams for three years, which start on 16 May, will “certainly not be a return to business as usual”. The union says soaring infection rates played havoc with exam preparation last term, and their members can’t see why the government won’t bring back free Covid tests for these pupils, to avoid the virus spreading in exam halls. Fields, a crime novelist who lives in Chichester, says: “These kids have all been through two years of emotional battering. The pandemic has hit them in a thousand small ways, and now we just expect them to walk into an exam room as though nothing has happened.” Measures to help GCSE and A-level students this year include releasing information on which topics will be covered, and timetabling exams in the same subject at least 10 days apart. A spokesperson for the Department for Education said the measures would support “safe and fair delivery of exams and recognise the disruption students have faced”. Fields says they don’t go far enough: “The stress the exams are putting on them is unjustifiable. They are bringing the grades nearer to normal but the pupils have been just as badly affected as those whose exams were cancelled.” Geoff Barton, general secretary of the ASCL, said it was “regrettable” that the government hadn’t done more to minimise the disruption caused by soaring infection rates this term, “rather than giving the impression the pandemic is over, which is clearly not the case”. A DfE blog last week said any pupil with a high temperature on the day of an exam should stay at home, in line with UK Health Security Agency guidance. But the ASCL is urging the government to bring back free Covid testing for exam candidates, to provide some certainty for pupils and invigilators. Barton said: “We simply can’t understand why the government does not take this simple step, particularly given that it has been so insistent about the importance of students sitting public exams.” Many invigilators are refusing to go into exam halls where there is no Covid testing or mitigations. A survey by the National Association of Examinations Officers found that nine out of 10 members are worried there won’t be enough experienced people to oversee exams this summer. The lead invigilator at a large secondary school, who asked not to be named, said she had withdrawn her services for this year because she did not feel safe. “How can they protect invigilators, who are predominately older and more vulnerable, with no mitigations?” she said. “If there is a problem or a student needs something, you have to help without disturbing anyone else, and you can’t do that at two metres.” She thinks students will feel obliged to sit exams, even if they are ill. “We see it every year. I’ve had someone come in with stomach pains and leave in an ambulance with a burst appendix. So there will be some who come in suspecting they have Covid.” Ed Muir, an English teacher in the north of England, said: “There are pupils still missing lessons but now we have no idea who has Covid. It is the silent disease in our midst.” Muir points out that stress will make pupils more vulnerable to Covid, and wants a return of free testing. “Teachers and parents want to know exactly what is expected. If your child feels ill the day before an exam, do you send them in?”    ",News/World news,"Bring back free Covid tests for exam candidates, UK schools urge",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/16/bring-back-free-covid-tests-for-exam-candidates-uk-schools-urge
4/16/2022,"Monika Devi is thrilled to be driving her autorickshaw. The 35-year-old has two reasons to be particularly proud as she winds her way through New Delhi’s insanely congested streets. She is one of the first women to be driving one of the three-wheeled taxis that swarm the roads of the Indian capital. And she is driving one of Delhi’s first e-rickshaws – part of the city’s drive to tackle its notoriously filthy air. “This city is unsafe for women, and until now they had no choice but to travel in an autorickshaw driven by a man, which can be scary at night,” she said. “Plus, I hate the pollution and feel happy that I’m doing my bit by driving an electric rickshaw which isn’t spewing out toxic fumes.” While some Indian cities such as Pune and Mumbai have female autorickshaw drivers (though only a handful), for some reason public transport in New Delhi remains an exclusively male affair. Indian women fly planes, sit in boardrooms and send rockets into space, but do not drive rickshaws or buses in Delhi. Sunita Choudhary became the city’s first woman autorickshaw driver 18 years ago, but since then no one else has taken up the challenge. This sort of low-level job appeals only to women from lower-income families, yet the conservative culture of this social stratum firmly resists the idea of women being out on the streets and interacting with men. “My father drives an autorickshaw, but he initially opposed me,” Devi said. “He thought male passengers would flirt with me or harass me. I had to fight him on this. I am not scared at all of being on the roads. If women are scared, how will we make progress?” Her e-rickshaw was subsidised by the Delhi state government, which has launched a fleet of 3,500 e-rickshaws – painted a sickly lilac rather than the standard yellow and green – and earmarked 500 for women. The din of honking and the Darwinian rules that determine who has right of way on Indian roads (it’s the bigger vehicle, so buses and trucks are king) make driving stressful. The e-rickshaw itself is a flimsy contraption on three wheels with no safety belts or protection and exposed to the fumes of other vehicles. Dolly Maurya, 26, another driver, is in Saket near the Select City Walk shopping mall, drenched in sweat in the 42-degree April heat. For a woman, as the hours go by, finding a public toilet is not easy. “It’s easy for male drivers, they just stop and pee on the roadside, but for me it’s always a choice between drinking water because I’m thirsty or not drinking it to avoid going to the loo,” said Maurya. And then there are boorish male rickshaw drivers who give them grief. While standing at a traffic light, two male drivers spot Maurya and jeer. “Look at that, now they’re taking our jobs too when they barely know their left from their right,” they laughed. The heckling is countered by the warm appreciation of women passengers. “They take my number so that they can call me if they are going out during the evening,” Maurya said. “Mind you, I’m not sure what my father and brothers will say about my being out after 8pm.” Her biggest anxiety is the battery running out a long way from a charging point. Delhi’s transport minister, Kailash Gahlot, is planning for drivers never to be further than 3km from a charging point, but that will take some time. Until it happens, most women e-rickshaw drivers will avoid long journey that could leave them stranded on a lonely road. The Delhi government is promoting e-rickshaws as part of its “paradigm shift” from fossil fuel- to electricity-based vehicles to try to reduce the air pollution. The city’s first electric bus began carrying passengers in January and there’s a pledge to add hundreds more soon. But for Jyoti Pande Lavakare, founder of non-profit Care for Air, the 3,500 e-rickshaws are a grain of sand in the desert compared to the 90,000 traditional autorickshaws with their polluting two-stroke engines. “We need to phase out all old polluting vehicles urgently. Starting with e-rickshaws is good, but it needs to be much more ambitious so that e-rickshaws are powered by renewable energy, not by electricity from polluting coal-fired power plants,” said Lavakare. Almost 40 women are also being trained to drive new automatic buses, both to give them jobs and for the comfort of female passengers who are still haunted by the 2012 gang rape and death of a young woman during a bus journey in the capital. For Devi, one thing stands out about her new job. “It’s the heady feeling of independence,” she said. “It’s important for a woman not to have to depend on her father or husband for money, and for me it’s the first time it has happened.”",News/World news,Women with electric rickshaws combat Delhi’s toxic air – and its sexism,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/16/women-with-electric-rickshaws-combat-delhi-toxic-air-and-its-sexism
4/16/2022,"The anti-corruption campaigner Bill Browder is calling on the US to issue visa bans against British lawyers who he has accused of “enabling” Russian oligarchs. The US-born financier, an outspoken and longtime critic of Russian president Vladimir Putin, has said that installing such a ban would strike at the heart of what he described as a persistent problem of oligarchs using the UK legal system against journalists and whistleblowers, tying them up in expensive lawsuits. Browder suggested sanctions could ultimately be targeted at any legal and financial experts who it could be shown have helped oligarchs hide their assets, but said his initial proposed blacklist was focused on British lawyers involved in libel cases. Browder described “this whole class of British lawyers” instructed by Russians and those with links to Russia to bring “lawsuits against journalists, dissidents and whistleblowers, myself included, and they make money”. “There’s this industry,” Browder said. “It will be pretty hard to legislate away the idea that a plaintiff can hire a lawyer to sue for libel, because how do you define what’s good and what’s bad? But if you identify a lawyer whohas been doing this on a regular basis – going after people – the United States does not have to give them a visa to come to this country.” The activist has proven to have influence on Capitol Hill. In a recent statement, US senator Ben Cardin called Browder a “hero” to “many” in the Senate, for his work in passage of the Magnitsky Act, an Obama-era bipartisan bill named after Browder’s former tax lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, who died in police custody in Russia in 2009. The act was designed to allow the US to punish officials linked to Magnitsky’s death, but also authorises the US to sanction human rights offenders and ban them from entering the country. Browder said he was seeking the support of senators and members of Congress to write a letter to the US Department of State with a list of names of specific lawyers, whose visas he felt ought to be taken away. He did not name the lawyers who might appear on the list. Browder also argued that targeting oligarch-enablers such as lawyers and accountants would be an effective way of finding their money, at least half of which he said ultimately finds its way to Putin’s coffers, as part of the Kremlin’s pact with the oligarchs. “There’s going to be a whole lot of smart law enforcement work looking at sanctions evasion now. These people have been running circles around us in the past,” Browder said. “They have set up the most robust asset protection mechanisms with trustees, holding companies, nominees and proxies offshore.” Finding the oligarchs’ money, he said, would be an “almost impossible task”. He said he would like to add an amendment to current sanctions law to hold lawyers, accountants, bankers and other financial advisers liable – including possible prison time – if they are found to have created structures to evade sanctions. “Very quickly the whole system would become very transparent,” he said. Browder’s remarks follow his recent testimony before the Helsinki Commission, an independent body that consists of nine members of the US House, nine senators, and one member of the US state, defence and commerce departments. The commission is meant to help formulate policy in connection to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and the hearing was focused on western “enablers” of Putin’s regime. Among Browder’s recommendations in his testimony was for the US to create a list of law firms, PR firms and investigative firms involved in “enabling dictatorships and oligarchs to persecute journalists” and prohibiting the US government from doing business with those firms; canceling the visas of “foreign enablers”, enforcing rules in which lawyers and public relations firms are meant to disclose their work for foreign governments; and creating new laws to protect journalists from so-called SLAPP suits that are meant to intimidate the press.",News/US news,Calls for US to issue visa bans for UK lawyers enabling Russian oligarchs,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/16/calls-for-us-to-issue-visa-bans-for-uk-lawyers-enabling-russian-oligarchs
4/16/2022,"Ipick up the phone to an old friend who, until a few weeks ago, had a working life a bit like mine; one might grandly call it a portfolio career, but in truth it’s a matter of turning your hand to all sorts of things to make a buck. In his case, a Starbuck; he’s a coffee devotee and, as we chatted, a sad story came to light, which saw him being relieved of his takeaway latte by an officious concierge as he arrived at a swanky office building for a meeting. Honestly, he said, I could have cried, to which you might retort, well, go ahead and cry me a river. Except that the latte was a little manifestation of creature comfort and normality, a treat to power him through a whistlestop trip to London, where he normally lives, but from which he has been largely absent recently. Nowadays, you can most often find him in Jaroslaw in Poland, where he has gone to volunteer for a newly founded charity called Poland Welcomes, its mission to provide shelter and amenities to Ukrainian women and children who have been forced to leave their homes. At the last count, they had 500 guests across a series of hastily adapted sites; they’re trying to scale up to 2,000. For a while, he seemed to be head of laundry – as he points out, you need a lot of washers and dryers when people arrive with only the clothes on their back – and now he’s added banging on the doors of organisations for funds. Every time he calls, I am newly in awe. He is my ordinary pal, who does ordinary things (plus ice-skating, which is not ordinary but at which he is irritatingly good). I never know quite what to ask him beyond how it’s going and what I can send. So I ask about the coffee. He sends a picture of a collapsible, portable filter that accompanies him everywhere but adds rather dolefully that he can’t fit a frother in his luggage. I send him a pic of my new blanket in a clumsy attempt at solidarity. It is all beautiful blue-and-yellow stripes and comes from a woollen mill here in Kilkenny. This latest production is the result of a collaboration with a young artist called Ellie Dunne, with all proceeds going to the Irish Red Cross. When I dropped into the mill to pick it up, they told me it had been all hands on deck to get the blankets woven in double-quick time, but that they didn’t hesitate for a second. It’s a little detail I might have added to the “time capsule” part of the Irish national census, which we’ve all just completed. Distribution and collection of the forms is done by hand and we had a jolly chat with the woman who came to get ours, ranging from ethnomusicology to the wisdom of Desiderata. It was sunny, and we were on the doorstep, looking at the cows. Eventually, my husband remarked that at this rate, and in an area so sparsely populated, she’d only manage to get about three forms safely gathered in during the course of a day, so off she went. In other local news, the Lord Bagenal Inn in the small town of Leighlinbridge is where my mother-in-law might go for a posh lunch with chums. Last week, though, she might also have seen Noble Yeats, the Grand National winner who’d done Sam Waley-Cohen so proud on his final ride before retiring; the horse had been brought home to do a lap of honour. Had I been there, I’d have given him only the finest carrots: piqued by his literary name and his provenance, I backed him at 66-1, the first and almost undoubtedly the last time I’ve ever been right at Aintree.

4/16/2022,"Paul Verhoeven is one of world cinema’s great provocateurs (the creator of Basic Instinct, Starship Troopers and Elle) and yet the most shocking thing about Benedetta – his tale of lesbian nuns in 17th-century Tuscany – is how tame and even tasteful it turns out to be. True, the plot (freely lifted from Judith C Brown’s 1986 book Immodest Acts) hinges on the appearance of a dildo whittled from a statue of the Virgin Mary – an incident which no doubt led to the film being picketed at the New York film festival and outright banned in Singapore. For all that, Verhoeven’s handling is more silly than savage, more playful than profane, which ensures that the picture’s cloistered heat never comes to the boil. Virginie Efira plays the novice nun who sparks mass hysteria; Charlotte Rampling the sour Mother Superior who insists that God’s greatest miracles rarely happen in bed. Both appear to be enjoying themselves, rattling merrily through all the stage-managed mischief, the flamboyant high jinks, the showboating satire.

4/16/2022,"Born in Michigan in 1962, director Paul Feig is known for films such as Bridesmaids, Ghostbusters, A Simple Favour, Spy and Last Christmas. On the small screen, he created the comedy series Freaks and Geeks and directed episodes of shows including The Office, Mad Men and Arrested Development; his most recent show is Welcome to Flatch, a US adaption of the BBC series This Country. He is also an actor and starred in the sitcom Sabrina the Teenage Witch. Feig has recently launched his own gin brand, Artingstall’s Brilliant London Dry Gin, in his quest to create the perfect martini. He lives in Chelsea with his wife. Tick, Tick... Boom! (Dir Lin-Manuel Miranda, 2021) Last year was an interesting one for movies, but this was the one that really got me. It’s based on Jonathan Larson, who wrote Rent – he was a struggling songwriter who wanted to write musical theatre so he put together this stage show based on his struggles. Andrew Garfield turned in a great performance. There’s a whole sequence about people who have Sunday brunch in New York that I thought was one of the most cleverly shot things I’ve ever seen. I was really affected by the film – it was emotional but very uplifting. Get Up, Stand Up! The Bob Marley Musical This is so much fun. Obviously I’m a big fan of Bob Marley – most people are. But you hear his music so much on the radio that you forget the live power it has. It makes you want to move: every time I’ve seen it, people are up in the audience, dancing and going crazy. It tells his life story, going from song to song, with these great performances. There’s a scene where the woman who plays Rita Marley sings No Woman, No Cry to him almost angrily. It’s really powerful for a woman to sing that song – it brings the house down. Claridge’s, London W1 My mum’s side of the family was British, so I love traditional stuff: Anderson & Sheppard suits, Savile Row. Claridge’s is a happy place for me, because it represents everything I like about London glamour. It’s so well run, and their attention to service is great. I go there to have breakfast, and we have Christmas dinner there when we’re in town. I walk down that curving staircase that goes into the lobby, wearing my finest, and feel like “Hey, I belong here”. For an anglophile who grew up in Detroit, Michigan, it’s a fairytale dream come true. Disaster Girls I love this podcast by two hilarious young women, Jordan Crucchiola and Amanda Smith. Every episode is about a disaster movie – some are terrible, some are actually good – and they go really deep into it and have an interesting perspective on everything.They don’t go in cynically, they really do love disaster movies: anything from Sharknado to a giant Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson movie to Roland Emmerich. They have so much fun doing it and it really makes me laugh. It’s a delightful way to spend a walk. Dukes London, SW1 Dukes bar is my favourite – I’ve been going there for 25 years. Alessandro Palazzi, the bartender there who’s the king of the martini, started around then too, so I’ve befriended him. I’m a cocktail enthusiast, let’s say. When I was a kid I didn’t want to be a kid, I just wanted to be grown up, and the martini always represented that to me. I love the pageantry of it: Alessandro will roll up a cart, frozen glass, frozen bottle, and make it right in front of you with a lemon peel from the Amalfi coast. It’s just this beautiful, classy place – it’s my Valhalla. Gogglebox This is my favourite show anywhere. I love Gogglebox – it’s got me through so many times. When I first heard about it I thought it sounded like the worst idea for a TV show ever. And literally within five minutes I thought, this is comfort food for me. Everybody on it is so incredibly funny, and it just cheers me up. As an American it gives me the chance to catch up on current British TV – it’s a great highlight reel for the week. Giles and Mary just destroy me. Under the Harrow by Flynn Berry I really like thrillers – Patricia Highsmith is one of my favourite authors. This is a book that came out a few years ago, which is a very affecting story of this woman whose sister is murdered and she’s trying to figure out who did it. It hits a lot of topics about violence against women and sexism and how the legal system is stacked against victims of domestic crime and sexual assault.

4/16/2022,"Baked by Easter sun and perhaps overburdened by expectation, Tottenham failed to put the hammer down on Arsenal. Instead, this stadium boiled in frustration and anxiety. For the second time in a week Brighton damaged a north London’s club’s top-four challenge, with Leandro Trossard’s late goal, stolen after Cristian Romero’s slip in his own box, repeating what happened to Arsenal at the Emirates. Tottenham were aiming to win a fifth consecutive league match for the first time since December 2018, but if they are to end a two-season absence from the Champions League they must play with far greater intensity. Robert Sánchez in the Brighton goal barely had a save to make, his work usually done by a well-organised defence throwing in heroic blocks. Arsenal’s visit to Tottenham on 12 May now looms large, though Brentford, Leicester and Liverpool have to be negotiated first. Brighton’s victory against Arsenal had ended a winless run that included a 2-0 home defeat to Spurs. Graham Potter, who was linked with the post vacated by Nuno Espírito Santo in early November before Antonio Conte’s appointment, has suffered through his team’s inability to score but always pointed to the quality of their play throughout that barren run. Those two goals at Arsenal represented two-thirds of Brighton’s output in their last eight Premier League matches and a less goal-shy team would surely have sealed all three points earlier than Trossard’s winner. Alexis Mac Allister, in perpetual, snarling motion, buzzed around with intent, while Yves Bissouma patrolled expertly ahead of a four-man defence. Brighton pressed hard, closing space before the ball could reach Harry Kane in his trademark deep-lying positions. The visitors’ early dominance had Conte barking from the edge of this technical area. He stayed there throughout, though the Italian, like his team, seemed less amped than normal. The loss of Matt Doherty for the rest of the season had brought Sergio Reguilón into the left wing-back position ahead of Ryan Sessegnon. Without the Irishman, a team that had scored 14 goals in four previous matches stalled, though Brighton deserve credit for cutting off the supply lines. It took until the 15th minute for Kane to have the ball in the Brighton box, and it proved a rarity. Enock Mwepu’s early fizzer looked goalbound before it brushed off Ben Davies and behind, and then Joël Veltman had a shot blocked. Dejan Kulusevski, who had otherwise been struggling to get into the game, was booked for flinging an elbow at Marc Cucurella in frustration. It was as prominent as the Swede got before being withdrawn in favour of Lucas Moura. As Brighton piled up the first-half pressure, Rodrigo Bentancur cleared away a Veltman flick after a Pascal Gross corner, and was also booked for taking down Bissouma in midfield. Spurs’ frustrations were shared by the home fans beginning to sniff an archetypal slip-up. There were howls of expectation when the ball briefly looked to have fallen to Kane, only for Cucurella to whip it away followed by groans when the striker broke into a limp. Kane swiftly recovered his step if not his influence, and Spurs went into the half-time break with a wobble very much in the offing. Much of their energy had gone into getting Mwepu a second yellow, first for colliding with Ben Davies and then a tackle on Pierre-Emile Højbjerg. Both would have been soft decisions, especially considering Kulusevski’s earlier escape, but Potter took the hint and removed the Zambian at half-time in favour of Danny Welbeck. As Brighton continued to press in the second half, Spurs’ frustrations continued. Son, previously a passenger, had a shot blocked by Veltman, and then another by Trossard. Just before the hour, Brighton’s problems in scoring goals were illustrated by a hopeless shank wide by Welbeck, which was greeted with jeers from home supporters looking for comfort amid their own team’s failings. Right after that, Moisés Caicedo’s poor first touch bailed out an Emerson Royal error as Brighton continued to threaten, with Mac Allister also firing over. With Harry Winks introduced into midfield, Spurs stepped it up in the last 15 minutes. Højbjerg’s run to the byline and cutback went unrewarded as Reguilón slid past the ball. But Brighton compiled more chances, Welbeck heading one of them over before Romero slipped over as he tackled the substitute Adam Lallana, presenting Trossard with the chance to score the winner his team – and Tottenham – deserved.",Sport/Football,Brighton’s Leandro Trossard strikes late to dent Tottenham’s top-four hopes,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/16/tottenham-brighton-premier-league-match-report
4/16/2022,"This sun-kissed thriller of a game had just about everything, from breathtaking skill to extraordinary late drama. From Quins’ perspective, though, it will be forever remembered as the one that got away as they fell one agonising point short over two legs against the French Top-14 leaders. Inspired by the double act of Marcus Smith and Alex Dombrandt Quins had looked set to clinch a famous Easter resurrection when Louis Lynagh’s 75th-minute try put them within a successful conversion of the quarter-finals. Alas for Smith, otherwise outstanding all day, the ball slid just the wrong side of the left-hand post and their 13-point victory on the day ultimately counted for little. Not even the most passionate Quins fan, though, could complain about the quality of the entertainment. It was frantic, fast-paced and furious but, ultimately, Quins could not quite complete another of their remarkable trademark comebacks. Montpellier’s reward is a last eight all-French duel with either La Rochelle or Bordeaux. Nor could anyone use the weather as any sort of excuse. Not only was it a cracking day to watch rugby but the clear blue skies and fast ground suited Quins’ attacking intentions perfectly. If you are trying to overcome a 14-point first-half deficit it helps be looking to do so in conditions made for rapid points scoring. Rapid was certainly the word for Quins’ opening score which materialised after a mere 33 seconds. It all felt rather too easy as Dombrandt sliced through a slightly flat-footed defensive line to put Huw Jones over but no one could accuse Montpellier of doziness after 11 minutes when their promising young fly-half Louis Forsans cleverly put his centre Yvan Reilhac over. It set the tone for a breathless first half with Dombrandt twisting over to score and restore the hosts’ advantage only for a Forsans penalty to peg back the lead again. The moment of the game then arrived after 29 minutes when Care acrobatically kept the ball from crossing the touchline in his own 22 and found Smith 10 metres out from his own line. Last week Smith had a forgettable game in France but a little dummy, an irresistible surge of pace and a deceptive hitch kick took him gloriously past the Montpellier cover on a thrilling counter raid. He found a surging Cadan Murley in support and the winger fed the lurking Joe Marchant for a diagonal length-of-the-field try to rank with anything Quins have scored all season. If the home supporters through it was the cue for the visitors to unravel, however, they were mistaken. The assured Forsans put in a well judged low cross kick and full-back Juilien Tisseron brilliantly scooped it up to score. It required a well-executed blindside scrum move three minutes before half-time to put Louis Lynagh over in the right corner and re-establish Quins’ 11-point lead on the day. Montpellier, though, still led by three points on aggregate and the arrival of the experienced Geoffrey Doumayrou, with Handré Pollard switching from centre to 10, was a reminder that nothing was going to be handed to Quins on a silver platter. A 54th-minute penalty for Pollard extended his side’s overall advantage to six and Zach Mercer’s appearance off the bench also gave the crowd momentary pause for thought. After eight increasingly contentious penalties conceded close to their own line, however, the 67th-minute sin-binning of the Montpellier replacement hooker Jeremie Maurouard offered Quins the chance to make the decisive thrust. Smith, dancing artfully around the outside of Bastien Chalureau, appeared to have delivered a classic coup de grace only for the ‘try’ to be ruled out for crossing and maintain the see-sawing drama right until the end.",Sport/Sport,Agony for Harlequins as Smith misses costly late kick against Montpellier,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/16/harlequins-montpellier-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report
4/16/2022,"Manchester City tactically flexed their muscles against West Ham in the first of the FA Cup semi-finals, comfortable 4-1 winners on a cloudless afternoon in east London. Gareth Taylor’s side are now on the path to securing their second piece of silverware this season after their Continental Cup triumph against Chelsea in March, who they may face again should the Blues emerge victorious in the second semi-final against Arsenal on Sunday. West Ham took a leaf from the book of the reigning champions, starting the game with an aggressive high press; clearly, they had taken some learnings from the 2-0 defeat suffered at the hands of City in the WSL a fortnight ago. The 3-5-2 formation set up by Olli Harder looked to put those insights into practice, stifling and snuffing out the City attack, while testing a defence that featured two recent returnees from injury: Alanna Kennedy and Alex Greenwood. For the most part, it worked. Both players were made to feel uncomfortable, Kennedy who appeared in a facemask having broken her nose in a friendly encounter against New Zealand on Tuesday, by Katerina Svitkova, and Greenwood by Lisa Evans. The latter had been nursing a bad knee, and it showed when she gave away possession and almost allowed Dagny Brynjarsdóttir to open the scoring in the 12th minute.Still, City did not panic, and instead waited for West Ham’s collective press to stutter. That’s exactly what happened in the 22nd minute via an almighty strike at goal from Keira Walsh that rattled the underside of the crossbar. Before Mackenzie Arnold could figure out where the ball was, Ellen White had acted first to snap up another poacher’s finish. City were now smelling blood, bypassing the press with ease and forcing them into playing panicked passes - one of which led to the second goal of the game. This time, it was captain Jill Flaherty who found Chloe Kelly with a peach of a ball across the box and the attacker did not fail to convert. Fortunately, there would be some reprieve for the hosts on the verge of half-time, and they snatched back a goal through Evans in the 42nd minute. Proof that though this City team were littered with star names, these were names that had been playing international football this past week, some for 90 minutes and longer. Taylor seemed to have that in mind on the other side of half-time when he brought on Hayley Raso for Kelly, livening up the attack in the hopes that West Ham’s continued attempts to adopt and maintain a high press would tire again, and with that would come more goals, again. The promise was fulfilled in the 66th minute via Lauren Hemp, who scored her 50th club goal, and City’s third of the game. Stealing possession from Lucy Parker, the City winger weaved her way into the West Ham box and then fired a low shot past Arnold into the bottom right-hand corner. The West Ham keeper had faced three shots at her goal in the game and had picked the ball out of her net each time. The introduction of Georgia Stanway, who had scored six times and assisted twice in eight appearances against the hosts, must not have been a welcoming sight. Khadija ‘Bunny’ Shaw joined Stanway on the pitch, while West Ham looked to bolster their defence by bringing on Emma Snerle. It mattered very little, as Taylor brought about more changes and his side responded by pushing the opposition defence further and further into their own defensive third until Hemp was able to find a gap and score the fourth goal of the game. At the final whistle, though West Ham approached the game with the appropriate zim and verve, they were out-thought and unable to keep up with White and Kelly as they led their team to a 17th win in 19 games across all competitions.The focus now turns on Arsenal and Chelsea to see who City will be playing in this season’s FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium in May.",Sport/Football,Lauren Hemp double sinks West Ham to book Wembley date for Manchester City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/16/west-ham-manchester-city-womens-fa-cup-semi-final-match-report
4/16/2022,"It is a weapon whose effectiveness was overtaken centuries ago by the gun and rifle. Yet the bow and arrow may deserve a prize place in the history of our species, say scientists. They believe archery could have been critical to Homo sapiens’ conquest of the planet, helping modern humans emerge from their African homeland tens of thousands of years ago. Early archers would have been able to kill their prey at a considerable distance while at the same time giving their diets a protein boost without endangering themselves, say researchers. It has also become clear that bow-and-arrow technology is ancient, with some of the oldest arrowheads traced to caves in South Africa and dated to around 64,000 years ago. Outside Africa, the earliest evidence of archery was some 48,000-year-old arrowheads found in a Sri Lankan cave two years ago. However, that date is now expected to be pushed back to around 54,000 years, after scientists – led by Ludovic Slimak of the University of Toulouse – revealed they had uncovered evidence that modern humans colonised the Grotte Mandrin cave in the Rhône Valley. Finds included a tooth of a modern human child and a set of tiny pointed stone tools that look very like arrowheads. Slimak said his team still had to confirm that these tools were arrowheads but stressed that the technology would have given modern humans a key advantage over Neanderthals who then occupied Europe. “An animal 100 metres away will think you are too distant to be dangerous and won’t move away,” Slimak told the Observer. “With a bow and arrow, you could pick it off easily. Equally importantly, you’ll be too far away for it to attack you if it is wounded and gets angry. So you can hunt safely and provide more protein for your group.” Professor Chris Stringer, of the Natural History Museum, London, added that it was now clear that the bow and arrow was a technology that was invented at different times in different parts of the world, underlining its importance to our species’ spread. “The crucial thing about making a bow is that you really need to know your materials. You have to pick a species of tree that has the right flexibility because the inside of a bow has to withstand considerable compression while the outside has to withstand stretching. You also need expert technicians to make the string, the arrowheads and the arrow shaft. The whole technology requires considerable expertise.” Slimak added that the tools uncovered at Grotte Mandrin were highly standardised. “The Neanderthals could make magnificent stone tools, but each was a one-off,” he added. “By contrast, those made by modern humans were very light, compact and uniform in size. This was an industry.” The Grotte Mandrin settlement puts the date of modern humans’ first appearance in western Europe about 12,000 years earlier than previous estimates. Despite their technical abilities, these settlers did not survive, however. After a period of perhaps 40 years, signs of the presence of modern humans on the Rhône disappear. Having spent all their lives in the region, this generation vanishes from the archaeological record. Then, around 2,000 years later, the site was reoccupied – by Neanderthals. So what happened to that early group of modern human colonisers? Slimak believes there were up to 100 men, women and children in the Grotte Mandrin settlement, descendants of modern humans who had travelled from the Levant along the Mediterranean coast. “There might not have been enough of them to maintain their biological strength, and they could not exchange genes with the locals, the Neanderthals. This is possibly because they did not have good enough relations with them or because the fertility between them was poor.” This point was backed by Stringer. “If you’ve got a small group of men, women and children, it’s likely you have only got a very small number of specialists – for instance, those skilled in making each element of the bows and arrows they were using, individuals who would know which trees to pick for making a bow and others who would know how to produce string and arrows. In that case, you’re going to be vulnerable if you lose one or two of them to hunting accidents or disease. If they haven’t passed on their expertise to others in the group, you’ll end up lacking critically important knowledge.” Stringer added it was also possible that climate change might have had an impact on the Grotte Mandrin group. “There are only a few species of trees whose wood is flexible and strong enough to make bows. So if there was a change in climate, those trees might have become rarer or even died out completely, and the group may have found it could not replace their bows and arrows. Their reliance on them would have left them exposed and fragile.” The Grotte Mandrin outpost appears to be one of several ultimately unsuccessful attempts by modern humans to settle in Europe before eventually taking over the continent. Sites in Romania and the Czech Republic have also been found to contain remains of our species from 40,000 to 50,000 years ago. However, bone analyses have produced genetic profiles that have no match among modern Europeans. As Stringer puts it: “These are some of our species’ lost lineages.”",News/Science,How archery was vital to the survival of early humans,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/16/how-archery-was-vital-to-the-survival-of-early-humans
