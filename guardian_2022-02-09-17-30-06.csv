2/9/2022,"China and South Korea have become embroiled in a cultural appropriation row after a woman appeared at the opening ceremony of the Beijing winter Olympics wearing traditional Korean dress. The Chinese embassy in Seoul defended the decision to include a participant wearing hanbok, describing her as a representative of the country’s dozens of ethnic groups.  Her appearance sparked anger among many South Koreans, who denounced it as another attempt by China to claim parts of Korean culture – including its national dish, kimchi – as its own. The embassy described the woman as a member of the joseonjok – an ethnic minority with roots in Korea – who took part in the Games’ opening ceremony among more than 50 other representatives of ethnic groups in China. “It is their desire and right for representatives of each ethnic group in China to attend an international sports competition and the major national event of the Beijing Winter Olympics, wearing their traditional costumes,” an embassy spokesperson said in a statement, according to the Yonhap news agency. The spokesperson said China “respected” Korean historical and cultural traditions, and called on South Koreans to “respect the emotions” of China’s ethnic minorities. China is home to about 2 million ethnic Koreans, half of whom live on the Chinese side of the North Korean border. They are a recognised minority group whose language and culture are granted official protection. The embassy’s explanation is unlikely to quell anger in South Korea, where politicians said that the incident could fuel anti-Chinese sentiment. Lee Jae-myung, who is running in March’s presidential election for the ruling Democratic party, wrote on Facebook: “Do not covet (our) culture. Oppose cultural appropriation.” Lee So-young, a Democratic party MP, said: “This is not the first time China has introduced Korean culture as if it were its own. If the anti-China sentiment of the Korean people becomes stronger by leaving this issue as is, it will be a big obstacle when conducting diplomacy with China in the future.” Relations between the two countries soured in 2017 after South Korea approved the deployment of a US missile defence system to deter threats from North Korea. China, however, said the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (Thaad) deployment would upset the regional security balance as it could be used to penetrate its own territory. China banned groups traveling to South Korea – a popular destination for Chinese tourists – and shuttered dozens of stores operated by the South Korean supermarket chain Lotte Mart over supposed fire safety violations. Lotte Mart exited the Chinese market the following year. Christopher Del Corso, the chargé d’affaires ad interim at the US embassy in Seoul, appeared to side with his host country in the hanbok row. “What comes to mind when you think of Korea? Kimchi, K-pop, K-dramas … and of course Hanbok,” he tweeted on Tuesday, accompanied by the hashtag #OriginalHanbokFromKorea and a photograph of himself wearing the garment. In 2020, the countries’ netizens clashed over the provenance of kimchi, a dish regarded as an essential part of the Korean diet. The exchanges came after a Chinese pickled vegetable dish called pao cai received certification from the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO). That status, the Chinese state-run Global Times newspaper reported, was an “international standard for the kimchi industry led by China”. The Beijing Games have so far been a frustrating experience for South Koreans, who reacted with fury after two of their short track speed skaters, Hwang Dae-heon and Lee June-seo, were disqualified during their semi-finals in the men’s 1,000m on Monday for rule violations. Their disqualifications meant two Chinese athletes progressed to the final, with the host country winning gold and silver. Park Joo-min, a ruling party MP, said the Olympic organisers should be “ashamed of themselves” for turning the Games into a “local Chinese event”, while his colleague Kim Yong-min said the “biased rulings damaged the spirit of the Olympics as well as our athletes”, according to the Korea Times. The Korean Sport and Olympic Committee said it would file an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport “to formalise the injustice of this decision”. “We plan to do our best to prevent injustice from happening to our athletes in the international ice skating and sporting communities,” it said in a statement.",News/World news,Hanbok at Beijing Winter Olympics opening sparks South Korean anger,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/hanbok-beijing-winter-olympics-opening-sparks-south-korea-chinan-anger
2/9/2022,"A billionaire donor to the Conservative party has suggested that Boris Johnson should resign, saying that the prime minister was “past the point of no return”. John Armitage, co-founder of the hedge fund firm Egerton Capital, who has given £3.1m to the Conservatives, including more than £500,000 since Boris Johnson entered No 10, told the BBC he thought leaders should leave if they lose their moral authority.  He added: “I find the lack of honour inherent in modern politics incredibly distressing.” Armitage said he had told the Conservatives he would not be giving the party any more financial support as things stood. The financier has also given much smaller amounts of money to Labour, made individual donations to the former Labour MP Frank Field, and contributed to the remain campaign in 2016. A Conservative spokesperson told the BBC the government remained “fully focused on delivering for the British people”. Armitage’s intervention comes after a torrid period for Johnson with an investigation by the senior civil servant, Sue Gray, into parties held at Downing Street and Whitehall during Covid lockdowns finding “serious failures of leadership”. A police investigation is looking at the most serious allegations within the “partygate” scandal and in the meantime Johnson has endured a series of resignations from senior officials, some of which he has sought to replace. Armitage told the BBC global challenges to the west required ‘‘very serious, engaged politicians with a sense of purpose”. “Politicians should go into politics to do good for their country,” he added. “That is the overwhelming reason to be in politics. I don’t think it’s about your own personal sense of getting to the top of a snakes-and-ladders game.” Asked by the BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, if Johnson was “past the point of no return”, he replied: “Well, personally yes.” On Wednesday, the health minister, Ed Argar, indicated Johnson would not apologise to Starmer for his remarks about Jimmy Savile, despite the Labour leader being harassed by a mob of conspiracy theorists near parliament on Monday, some of whom yelled “paedophile protector” at him. Asked if the Johnson would say sorry for the jibe, Argar told Sky News: “The prime minister … has been very clear – he’s clarified what he was talking about. “I know colleagues of mine have been on (and) had this conversation with you in recent days. He’s clarified that he was talking about Sir Keir in the context of his leadership role at the CPS. Just as, quite rightly, Sir Keir holds him to account for his leadership role over the government. “That doesn’t mean personal responsibility for individual decisions, but that’s the context, and the prime minister has clarified that. And I’ll be honest with you, I suspect that’s what you will hear from the prime minister later.” ",News/Politics,Billionaire Tory donor calls for Boris Johnson to resign,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/09/billionaire-tory-donor-john-armitage-calls-for-boris-johnson-to-resign
2/9/2022,"“What is the latest that two goals have been scored in a game for a team to come from behind to win?” Andrew Brinkhurst tweeted after Tottenham turned a 95th-minute 2-1 deficit around at Leicester. “Apart from a game with a huge amount of injury time, there can’t be many later?” “I have a great example from 2002,” writes Alan Gibbs. “At that time I was studying in Nottingham, and so rarely got to see my team, Bristol City, but in November they played at Mansfield, a short trip up the A60. It was 1-1 at half time and then Christian Roberts put City ahead 2-1 before the game lurched in Mansfield’s favour. They soon equalised and then, following the award of a penalty, there was a multi-player fracas which resulted in the sending off of a Mansfield defender. The penalty was saved, but the rebound scored, and they scored again soon after.  “It remained 4-2 until the 87th minute, by which time a good number of City fans had already left – but then we got a penalty. Brian Tinnion scored it, but the score remained 4-3 until the 95th minute, when Leroy Lita flicked in to make it 4-4. We were still celebrating when, now in the 96th minute, Roberts smashed in the winner from just outside the penalty box. I told myself after the match that I’d probably never see a more exciting game, and I haven’t in the nearly 20 years since.” Mansfield 4 Bristol city 5, 2002 the great comeback.#BristolCity #mansfieldtown #twitter92 pic.twitter.com/QMCOhcsDZ0 🎙️ Something to hopefully bring a smile to your day⚽️ Mansfield 4-5 Bristol City, November 2002 - as broadcast on @bbcrb @alidurdenBBC @Scotty_Murray @timshires @BristolCity pic.twitter.com/GMIgj1anPE Also of note is the dramatic contest between Pohang Steelers and Gangwon FC in Korea’s K-League back in 2019. Pohang were 4-0 up after 70 minutes and still 4-2 up going into the 92nd, at which point Gangwon made it 4-3. The equaliser came in the 94th with the winner in the 96th. The latest comeback we can find, however, doesn’t pass the final clarifier of the question and remains somewhat shrouded in mystery. Here’s Sebastian Hughes, writing to the Knowledge in 2011 … “I was unpacking some deliveries at our shop which arrived in an old copy of the Sun sport pages from about 2010,” begins Warwick Bassett. “In the results, there was a team by the name of ‘The South Coast Team’. Does anyone have any idea who they are or were?” It transpires the mystery team was none other than Southampton. Aaron Grierson takes up the tale. “In 2010, Southampton, then in League One, barred all photographers from newspapers and news agencies from their home games. They instead licensed exclusive rights to a photographer, who would give syndication rights to the Digital South agency. This led to fears that Digital South would avoid taking or publishing images that were negative for Southampton – for instance, a Saints player getting sent off. “The Sun began referring to the club only as ‘The South Coast Team’ (or ‘Opposition’) in response to the move. The Bournemouth Echo used photos from the 80s to supplement their match reports. Others used cartoons to represent the action, while the Swindon Advertiser used Subbuteo reconstructions. By September 2010 Southampton mostly reneged on their ban and allowed a few more photographers inside, although oddly they still seemed to have a vendetta against the Daily Echo, who were still barred from games as late as November.” Thanks also to Steve Williams for providing more info on the Sun’s stance, and a report from, er, the Guardian. “When Morocco played against Comoros, it occurred to me that this might be the highest ever number of Os in a first-class fixture (six, three each),” suggests Daniel Marcus. “Can anyone come up with more?” Let’s begin with another example from the Africa Cup of Nations, courtesy of Richard Booth. “Afcon also supplies an answer: in 2017, the Democratic Republic of Congo beat Morocco 1-0 (a total of seven Os between them).” Rob Hamilton offers up a six-O fixture from League One – Fleetwood Town v Northampton Town in League One last January. “Appropriately enough, it finished 0-0.” Philip Platts can go one better with a historical name. “Bournemouth and Boscombe Athletic played Brighton and Hove Albion and Northampton Town in the 1923-24 Third Division South.” That’s seven Os in both fixtures, but here comes Rob again … “Wootton Bassett Town renamed themselves Royal Wootton Bassett Town in July 2015, to give them five Os in their name. In the level-nine Hellenic Premier Division they played Wokingham & Emmbrook for an eight-O match. They had another in the FA Vase in 2020-21, against Stonehouse Town in the second qualifying round.” But wait, Philip Platts isn’t finished. “Collingwood Warriors played one season in Australia’s top tier, the now-defunct NSL, in 1996-97 – where they played Wollongong Warriors.” So that’s a top-flight eight-O fixture to go with one in the English ninth tier. Woo hoo! “What is the coldest recorded temperature that a football match has been played in?” wondered Stephen Robbins in 2010. We couldn’t find a definitive answer for this one but earlier that month Rosenborg – who play in Trondheim, Norway – hosted Bayer Leverkusen in a Europa League tie. The temperature had plunged below -14C by the time the match had kicked off. We’ll forgive players for wearing mittens on string for that one. Meanwhile former Morton striker Marko Rajamaki criticised the SFA for the rash of postponements during a cold snap in Scotland and said: “There’s a league club, RoPs, in Lapland, where it gets down to -30C. But they have access to a full-sized indoor training pitch so they can still work.” Finally, Football’s Strangest Matches by Andrew Ward provided this chilly anecdote: In December 1891 Blackburn travelled to Burnley to take on the Clarets in freezing temperatures and heavy snow. They might have wished they hadn’t bothered – Rovers were 3-0 down inside 25 minutes. Half-time couldn’t come quickly enough, but after the break the visiting team failed to appear on the field. Blackburn eventually re-emerged, a few fisticuffs followed and soon after all the Blackburn players bar goalkeeper Herby Arthur left the field. Burnley attacked, were, unsurprisingly caught offside and after a lengthy spell of time wasting by Arthur, referee JC Clegg abandoned the game. Rovers late apologised, saying their players had been numb with cold and couldn’t continue. 2022 update! A new contender for the title of “football’s coldest match” came this month when the US welcomed Honduras to Minnesota and -16C temperatures. “It was freezing,” said Christian Pulisic afterwards, not unreasonably. “The other day, the Wordle answer was MOUNT, which got me thinking – is Mason Mount the only footballer (present or former) whose first and second name are recognised five-letter words in the dictionary and therefore legitimate potential answers in Wordle?” asks Joe Hutton.

2/9/2022,"A police officer who was threatened with an axe by Kumanjayi Walker told the Warlpiri man’s family that if he did the same thing to another officer “he might get shot”, a court has heard. The court has also heard that three days later, Walker used a pair of surgical scissors to stab constable Zachary Rolfe, who shot him dead.  Rolfe is on trial in the Northern Territory supreme court for the alleged murder of Walker. He has pleaded not guilty to that charge and two alternate charges, and is arguing his actions were reasonable and justifiable in the context of the danger faced by him and a colleague. On Wednesday, the court heard from two police officers who had attempted to arrest Walker at the remote community of Yuendumu on 6 November 2019, several days before Walker’s death during the attempted arrest involving Rolfe. Walker, 19, was wanted by police for removing an electronic monitoring device and escaping a residential alcohol treatment facility the previous month. Senior constable first class Christopher Hand gave evidence that he and his colleague, Senior Constable Lanyon Smith, had not expected Walker to be armed when they attended a property known as House 577. Walker’s partner Rickisha Robertson lived at the house with her family and Walker often stayed there, Hand said. After the officers found Walker in a bedroom and told him he would be arrested, he charged at them with a small axe or tomahawk, before dropping it on the front porch and fleeing, the court heard. Hand agreed that after chasing Walker through a section of scrubland known as the men’s area, where Warlpiri men performed ceremonies, he returned to the house and spoke to Lottie Robertson, Rickisha’s grandmother. He agreed with defence counsel David Edwardson QC that in a conversation with Robertson about what Walker had just done he told her: “next time he does that, he might get shot”. But Hand told the court that immediately after that he said “in Alice Springs. Like, community policeman are different to town policeman”, which was meant as a reference to how police in remote Indigenous communities operated. “It’s a different way of policing on Indigenous communities,” Hand said on Wednesday. “We always like to be as non-violent as we can with arrests, because we have to live in those areas, in those communities, and we’re trying to build partnerships. “Obviously if force needs to be used, we use it.” Hand agreed with a suggestion by Edwardson that he considered the arrest to be relatively stock standard. He told the court he knew Walker had a criminal history, but did not consider him to be dangerous, and did not check Walker’s file on the NT police case management system, nor formulate an arrest plan. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Hand, who has been a police officer for more than 25 years and worked extensively in remote communities, said neither he or Smith shouted any verbal commands to Walker. He said that training also included the phrase “edged weapon equals gun”, but there were a range of other factors that had to be considered before an officer drew their weapon, such as whether they were prepared to fire it, and the distance from the offender. Hand agreed with a question put by Edwardson that he froze during the incident, that he was not proud of freezing, and that his first thought was, “shit, I’ve got to get out of here”. Smith, the other officer present during the incident said in his evidence on Wednesday that he had worked for two years before the incident in Yuendumu, and believed he had a good working relationship with most of the 600-800 people who lived there. He did not consider drawing his weapon during the incident because of a combination of factors, including that he and Walker knew each other and he had dealt with him before, and the presence of other people in the house. But he agreed with Edwardson that immediately after the incident, when he and Hand were walking back towards the house after abandoning the chase for Walker, he told his partner he was stuck in the corner during the attack and “I just begged for mercy basically”. Despite this, he said he never thought he would be harmed, partly because in his experience it was common for Warlpiri men to use a show of force as a demonstration to their families that they would protect them. “Everything was processing extremely fast in a short period. I had adrenaline going through me, but I didn’t feel that he was going to hurt me. “It was more of an intimidation to get out of the room … Kumanjayi, being a Warlpiri man, it was more of a show to his partner, who was in the room, and his family. But he just wanted to get away.” Prosecutors told the court in opening submissions that Rofle became aware of the axe incident on 7 November 2019, and was logged on the NT police case management system as having accessed footage of it at least 15 times before his deployment to Yuendumu on 9 November 2019. About 7.20pm that day, Rolfe shot Walker three times after attempting to arrest him at Walker’s grandmother’s house in Yuendumu, the court has heard. Walker had been asked to put his hands behind his back by Rolfe. But instead Walker pulled a pair of medical scissors from his pocket and brought them down in a stabbing motion into Rolfe’s left shoulder. Rolfe’s colleague, Constable Adam Eberl, struggled with Walker, who was shot soon after by Rolfe, the court heard. The first shot is not subject to any charges. Prosecutor Philip Strickland SC told the Northern Territory supreme court on Tuesday that as Eberl and Walker struggled on a mattress on the floor, Eberl gained control of Walker. Strickland said Erbel was on top of Walker, whose right arm, which had been holding the scissors, was pinned under him. Edwardson said the defence disputes Erbel had control of Walker at the time. Rolfe walked across the room, placed his left hand on Eberl’s back, and pressed his right hand, holding his Glock semi-automatic handgun, against the left side of Walker’s body, Strickland said. Rolfe then pulled the trigger twice in quick succession, in what Strickland said on Monday was known as a “double-tap” designed to ensure maximum damage. It is the second and third shots that are subject to the murder charge. Edwardson said Rolfe would defend his actions as being reasonable and justifiable in the context of the danger faced by him and Erbel. Edwardson said Rolfe was acting in self-defence, and to defend the life of Erbel, when he fired the second and third shots, and his training emphasised that “edged weapon equals gun”.

2/9/2022,"SpaceX will lose up to 40 of the 49 Starlink satellites it launched last week as the result of a geomagnetic storm, the company has announced. Elon Musk’s firm launched the satellites into low-Earth orbit on 3 February from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, but 80% of them are now expected to burn up instead of reaching their intended orbit.  “Unfortunately, the satellites deployed on Thursday were significantly impacted by a geomagnetic storm on Friday,” SpaceX said in a statement. “These storms cause the atmosphere to warm and atmospheric density at our low deployment altitudes to increase.” The speed and severity of the storm resulted in an “atmospheric drag” that was up to 50% higher than during previous launches, it said. Geomagnetic storms are the result of interactions between solar wind – a stream of charged particles from the sun – and Earth’s magnetic field. Though the satellites were commanded to “take cover from the storm” by flying “edge-on (like a sheet of paper)”, they failed to carry out the manoeuvres required to reach their required orbit. “Up to 40 of the satellites will re-enter or already have re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere,” the firm said. “The deorbiting satellites pose zero collision risk with other satellites.” The Starlink satellites are designed to disintegrate upon re-entering Earth’s atmosphere, the company said, “meaning no orbital debris is created and no satellite parts hit the ground”. SpaceX has already launched 2,000 Starlink satellites and has permission from US authorities to send up 12,000 in total. The network has drawn growing concern from astronomers, who fear a “megaconstellation” of tens of thousands of satellites could blight the night sky and also hamper scientists’ ability to study the distant universe. Josef Aschbacher, head of the European Space Agency, said in December Musk was “making the rules” in space, and called for coordinated action from the European Union to ensure that SpaceX’s satellite internet constellation did not prevent other countries from launching their own satellites. In the same month, China accused the US of ignoring international treaty obligations after two “close encounters” in which the Chinese space station was forced to manoeuvre to avoid collisions with Starlink satellites.",News/Science,SpaceX to lose up to 40 Starlink satellites after geomagnetic storm,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/09/spacex-to-lose-up-to-40-starlink-satellites-after-geomagnetic-storm
