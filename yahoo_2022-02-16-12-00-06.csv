It wasn't easy seeing Las Vegas and really the entire state of Nevada shut down, but the giants of the field who dominate the iconic Las Vegas Strip had the resources to weather months of closures, over a year of pandemic-related rules, and convention cancellations, as well as a large percentage of Americans being reluctant to travel.

2/16/2022,"MULTAN, Pakistan (AP) — A Pakistani man sentenced to life in prison in 2019 for strangling his sister, a model on social media, was acquitted of murder Monday after his parents pardoned him under Islamic law, an attorney for the man's family said. Waseem Azeem was arrested in 2016 after he confessed to killing Qandeel Baloch, 26, for posting what he called “shameful” pictures on Facebook. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison but his parents had sought his release, said Sardar Mahboob, a lawyer who represents Azeem and his family. Islamic law in Pakistan allows a murder victim’s family to pardon a convicted killer. Baloch’s murder at the time drew nationwide condemnation, but critics suspected Azeem could walk out of prison after his conviction if his parents forgave him. Mahboob said Azeem could be freed as early as this week after the completion of paperwork. The siblings' mother, Anwar Bibi, welcomed the court order. “I am happy over the acquittal of my son, but we are still sad for our daughter's loss,"" she said. She told reporters that her slain daughter cannot come back “but I am thankful to the court, which ordered the release of my son at our request."" Baloch was found strangled in her home near the city of Multan in Punjab province. She was killed after she posted racy pictures on Facebook of herself with a Muslim cleric, Mufti Abdul Qawi, who was later arrested for his alleged involvement in the murder. The cleric was later freed as police said they could not establish a link to the murder. Nearly 1,000 Pakistani women are murdered by close relatives each year in so-called “honor killings” for violating conservative norms on love and marriage. Such killings are considered murder. But Islamic law in Pakistan allows a murder victim’s family to pardon the killer, which often allows those convicted of honor killings to escape punishment.",World/Associated Press,Pakistani court acquits model's killer on parents' pardon,https://news.yahoo.com/pakistani-court-acquits-models-killer-142913689.html
2/16/2022,"Fox News’ Jeanine Pirro apparently needs a refresher on who was running the country in 2020. During a segment on Tuesday on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s decision to invoke emergency powers to quell anti-vaccine mandate protests in Ottawa, Pirro griped that Trudeau “is now going to listen to” U.S. President Joe Biden. “Biden now has the final word on what you should do if someone is protesting peacefully. Biden, the same guy who in the summer of 2020 decided he would allow people to burn down streets and businesses and create all kinds of problems,” she said. Biden was a private citizen in 2020. Donald Trump was president when the police killings of George Floyd and other Black men and women spurred nationwide protests against racial injustice that summer. Despite Pirro’s claim they created “all kinds of problems,” the protests against police violence and racism were overwhelmingly peaceful, according to Harvard research, though rioting and fires broke out in some cities after clashes between police and demonstrators. Who wants to tell her?

During that conversation, Biden “expressed his concern that U.S. companies and workers are experiencing serious effects, including slowdowns in production, shortened work hours, and plant closures,” according to a White House statement. Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act this week, giving his government broad powers to restore order, including by freezing bank accounts of those aiding the protesters. The self-styled “Freedom Convoy” groups first blocked roads in late January to protest vaccine mandates for truckers, but the demonstrations have since grown to oppose other health restrictions intended to limit the spread of COVID-19.
