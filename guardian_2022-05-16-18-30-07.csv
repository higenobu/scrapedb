5/16/2022,"It’s rush hour and I’m gripped by a searing hot pain in my pelvis as I take my seat on the bus. It’s the kind of pain that takes my breath away, that leaves me pale and shaky. This is not the first time this has happened to me, so I know how to keep my expression neutral, but if any fellow commuter was being observant they may notice a bead of sweat running down my temple, or that my breathing is coming out in shaky staccato exhales. I had overslept that morning and my fatal error had been running to catch the bus. The 30-second sprint was enough to trigger my pain for two weeks. Unless you’ve experienced chronic pain, it’s difficult to grasp just how it casts a shadow across everyday life. I’ve struggled with pelvic pain since my teens, and to some extent have learned to live alongside it. The cause was found, in my mid-20s, to be endometriosis, and the path to wellness has been a faltering, gruelling one. For some chronic pain conditions, including endometriosis, there is no magic cure. In my case, an extensive surgery in 2020 greatly improved my quality of life. But “chronic” means it will probably always be with me, to a greater or lesser degree, which is hard to accept as a patient. Everything we learn about medicine from childhood is that pain or injury is acute and temporary. Something hurts and then it heals, and taking painkillers is part of that process. But now, a new study has found using drugs such as ibuprofen and steroids to relieve short-term health problems could increase the chances of developing chronic pain in the long term. This new research joins a growing body of evidence that painkillers could be doing more harm than good. Recent years have seen an increasingly urgent effort among the medical community to manage pain in a different way, by prescribing less and relying on more holistic measures such as physiotherapy and mindfulness. In 2020, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) suggested that patients with chronic primary pain – where the cause for the underlying pain is unclear – should be offered “supervised group exercise programmes, some types of psychological therapy, or acupuncture”. That’s how I found myself in 2018 attending an NHS pain management course. Every Monday for seven weeks, I went back to school alongside 10 other women in a bid to reframe our thinking about our conditions. We were a motley crew from all over the country: a 25-year-old nurse, a retired teacher, a fortysomething mother of two, all of us suffering from chronic pelvic pain in different but equally appalling ways. The common thread between us was that we had exhausted all other options and most of us felt our doctors didn’t really know what else to do with us. We sat on hard plastic chairs in a bare clinic room illuminated with strip lighting, while healthcare professionals ran different sessions. A psychologist asked us how we feel in our bodies when we are in pain: do we feel anxiety in our stomach or in our chest? A physiotherapist got us to play with hula hoops and rackets and balls to show us that exercise can be fun! And we’re more capable than we think! Even if that meant taking a slow and steady approach to activity. An anaesthetist explained that chronic pain isn’t necessarily indicative of injury or illness but rather indicates nerves “misfiring”, even if it feels very real indeed. Our medication was also reviewed and fine tuned. And while there was no pressure to stop taking pain medication, emphasis was placed on broadening the scope of our coping strategies. Our progress was measured in questionnaires and an awkward test in which a physio counted how many times we could stand up and sit down on a chair in one minute. The course was well meaning and, in many ways, radical. It offered the kind of joined-up care that so many suffering from chronic conditions are desperate for, and it was the first time anyone had considered how my pain was affecting my mental health, which it was, greatly. I don’t know how my peers have fared since, but even with the best of intentions, after it ended I struggled to keep up with the relentless positivity towards my condition without the regular check-ins from a team of cheerleading experts. At first, I felt as if I’d made an uneasy truce with my pain. It hadn’t gone away, but we’d reached a common understanding. But as time passed I settled back into old thinking habits and, if anything, I felt where previously there was a fight in me to improve my pain by seeking answers, there was now a new apathy towards my prognosis. It would be foolish to underestimate the herculean effort it takes on the part of the patient to see their pain in a new light. For me, success hinges on regular community support, something that seems idealistic when the NHS backlog in secondary care in England could take years to clear. It also naively ignores the socioeconomic circumstances that impact a patient’s ability to engage with the treatment. Attending this course would have been impossible for me if I didn’t have an understanding employer who let me take sick leave on full pay, or if I had caring responsibilities at home. Just under 28 million adults suffer with chronic pain in the UK, and the economic impact of pain is greater than almost all other health conditions, due to its far-reaching consequences. Behind these figures are hard lives and wasted potential. If the NHS is serious about tackling a growing dependence on opiates, then we must first address the dearth of funding that goes into pain research. Studies about painkillers such as this latest one provoke a collective sigh from chronic-pain patients. It’s important we evaluate the effect of current pain-management options, especially when they carry their own risks. However, as our population ages the need to know what does work becomes vital, made all the more complex by the fact that what works for one patient may not be effective for others. Pain is as complex as the people whose lives it affects; our responses will have to be multifaceted too if they’re to meet the challenge.

5/16/2022,"Paul Kagame, the president of Rwanda, has suggested the UK extradite suspects wanted in the east African country for alleged roles in the 1994 genocide, after a controversial deal with the Home Office to process asylum seekers there. Speaking less than two weeks after the deal was announced, Kagame told an audience of diplomats in Kigali that included the British high commissioner, he hoped “that when the UK is sending us these migrants, they should send us some people they have accommodated for over 15 years who committed crimes [in Rwanda]”. “We sent case files [to the UK] and … investigated. These are clear case files. Instead of being accommodated there in that beautiful place of [the] UK, they should be in jail, either in the UK or here,” Kagame said. The presence in the UK of five men alleged to have played an active and important role in the killing of more than 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and some moderate Hutus over three months in Rwanda in 1994 has been an irritant in relations with Kigali for many years. British judges have blocked extradition on the grounds the suspects would not receive a fair trial in Rwanda. Officials in Kigali have called for a trial in the UK instead. All five, aged between 61 and 69, came to the UK in the immediate aftermath of the genocide where they applied for asylum. They deny the allegations against them. The comments will raise concerns that the British government has made undisclosed promises to Kagame, or will now find it difficult to refuse requests from Kigali on sensitive issues. Under the new deal, Rwanda will be paid an initial £120m to receive refugees who arrive illegally in the UK. The full details of the agreement have not been made publicly available. Weeks before the deal was announced, the government confirmed the appointment of Rwanda’s new ambassador to the UK, after a delay of eight months. Johnston Busingye, Rwanda’s long-serving justice minister, was named as the new envoy amid international scrutiny over the alleged “rendition” and trial of Paul Rusesabagina, the hotelier credited with saving many lives during the genocide – portrayed in the film Hotel Rwanda. On 29 April, Busingye was received by the Queen at Buckingham Palace in a virtual audience. The Home Office did not respond to requests for comment. In his speech Kagame denied the deal with the UK meant Rwanda was “buying and selling people”. “No, we don’t do that kind of thing. We can’t do that because of our core values …“When the UK approached us and because of a problem they have … we are happy to deal with that problem,” Kagame told the diplomats. “There is nothing bad about this … There is nothing we cannot be transparent about.” Kagame’s reference to the five alleged genocide suspects may be embarrassing for the UK government and fuel criticism of the asylum deal. In 2019, ministers told parliament the government was “not shielding any war criminals” and had spent £3m “trying to get the right outcome” on an investigation launched after the court rulings on extradition and requests from the Rwandan government. Last year, MPs formed an all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on War Crimes to “look into matters relating to the presence of alleged Rwandan war criminals in the UK and the prosecution of those who participated in the Rwandan genocide”. In April last year, Busingye, as minister of justice, pledged that “Rwanda does not seek revenge” and that though extradition was denied, Rwanda had agreed to a trial by the UK courts. “We are still watching and waiting, waiting for the one signal that will show the genocide victims, in their lifetime, that finally there is commitment to bring these fugitives to justice,” he said. Rusesabagina was tricked into returning to Rwanda in August 2020, in what amounted to an enforced disappearance, a serious violation of international law, the New York-based Human Rights Watch said at the time. He was later convicted of involvement in a rebel group blamed for deadly attacks in Rwanda. A 25-year jail sentence was upheld by Rwanda’s court of appeal, a ruling his family says is in effect a death sentence for the ailing 67-year-old. In his speech to the diplomats, Kagame criticised those whose understanding of Rwanda’s history was based on “a movie”, a reference to Hotel Rwanda. “He’s a hero, people say … But what about the families of the victims, people who were lost [at] the hands of this person and the group he led?” the president said. Kagame became head of state in 2000 after he and his rebel forces halted the genocide in 1994 after 100 days of killing resulted in about 800,000 deaths. ​He brought stability, security and economic growth to a shattered country but has also been accused of running a repressive, authoritarian state.",News/World news,Rwanda president suggests UK extradite genocide suspects after asylum deal,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/rwanda-president-suggests-uk-extradite-genocide-suspect-asylum-deal-paul-kagame
5/16/2022,"Slow Waker I look at the nephew,eighteen, across the breakfast.He had to be called and called.He smiles, but withoutconviction. He will nothave tea, oh OK,if it’s no trouble,he will have tea. His adult face is brand-new.Once the newnessclears up and it has gotan expression or twobesides bewildermenthe could be a handsomedevil. He could bea carpenter, a poet, it’sall possible…impossible. The futureis not a word in his mouth. That, for him, is the trouble:he lay in bed caught deepin the mire betweensleep and awake, neitheralert nor resting,between the flow of night,ceaselessly braiding itself,and the gravelly beachthat our soles have thickened on.Nobody has ever told himhe is good-looking,just that his feet smell. He paces through alien Londonall day. Everythingis important and unimportant.He feeds only by osmosis.He stares at the glintand blunt thrust of traffic. Hewants to withdraw. He wants to withdraw intoa small space, likethe cupboard under the stairswhere the vacuum cleaner is kept,so he can wait, and doze,and get in nobody’s way. Thom Gunn, born in Gravesend, Kent, in 1929, published his impressive first collection, Fighting Terms, in 1954, and moved to San Francisco in the same year. Co-opted by UK critics to the Movement – a poetic school known for formal rigour, plain-speaking and general down-to-earthiness – Gunn is perhaps the Movement poet least defined or confined by its principles. His subsequent collections reflect American poetic influences and a more direct identification with gay culture. While never abandoning the use of formal techniques, he was able to bring that discipline into his freer structures, as this week’s poem demonstrates. First published in The Passages of Joy in 1982 and included in Collected Poems, 1993, Slow Waker combines formal precision with a certain easy and discursive style. As a character sketch of a young man, it presents a cool objectivity towards his subject from the outset. The boy is “the nephew”, as breakfast is “the breakfast”. The indeterminacy of his condition is established: he seems both asleep and awake at the table, and confusedly changes his mind about the offered cup of tea. As the narrative progresses, it becomes an inquiry into adolescence – adolescence as an experimental life-stage with its own psychology and biology. Emotion is kept at bay: the “newness” of the boy’s face is a condition that will one day “clear up” – the verb suggesting a case of acne. Among possible looks, “he could be a handsome / devil”, but the tone of the compliment more than hints that we shouldn’t count on it. The objectivity is a beautiful kind of tact. The narrator seems to be giving his subject space to be both everything and nothing. He resists the adult habit of sentimentalising youth as an icon of promise. Antitheses continue. The suggested adult roles of carpenter and poet (perhaps not entirely antithetical professions, admittedly) are both “possible” and “impossible”. When the third stanza returns to the backstory of the first, the young man in bed is “caught deep / in the mire between / sleep and awake, neither / alert nor resting”. How much fresher it is to pair noun and adjective, “sleep and awake”, instead of the drearily correct “sleep and waking”. The contrast between the states is laid bare by this simplest of innovations. Long-term familiarity between the nephew and the speaker is implied by the memory of the beach that “our soles have thickened on” and topped up by the gentle joke about the boy’s feet that ends the verse. The nephew has been a visitor before, and perhaps in a different setting. Was the beach in California? Is the nephew American? Those questions may be relevant to the next stage of the narrative, which finds him in London, dazzled, over-absorbent, as a jetlagged tourist might be. “Everything / is important and unimportant”. It’s the way a city feels to a newcomer, as perhaps the dazzle of possible selves feels to an adolescent. Now the speaker’s affection, though undeclared, is increasingly clear from the intensity with which he imagines the overwhelmed consciousness, and the desire for withdrawal. The young man who “feeds only by osmosis” is a kind of chrysalis; he needs a dim, secluded place in which to develop. The cupboard under the stairs is a womb-like privacy, the opposite of the glinting, thrusting city, and perhaps also preferable to the enforced sociability of the visit to an uncle. What seems a touchingly modest desire, to “wait, and doze, / and get in nobody’s way” recognises an organism’s need for time and stillness. The seeming depersonalisation of the teenage nephew in this poem seems one more instance of the depth and humanity of the poet’s understanding.",Arts/Books,Poem of the week: Slow Waker by Thom Gunn,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/16/poem-of-the-week-slow-waker-by-thom-gunn
5/16/2022,"The massacre by a white supremacist gunman of Black shoppers at a Buffalo grocery store has drawn renewed scrutiny of Republican figures in the US who have embraced the racist “great replacement theory” he is alleged to have used as justification for the murders. Born from far-right nationalism, the extremist ideology expounding the view that immigration will ultimately destroy white values and western civilization has found favor not only with media figures, such as conservative Fox News host Tucker Carlson, but a host of elected politicians and others seeking office. Those who have convinced themselves Democrats are operating an open-door immigration policy to “replace” Republican voters with people of color and keep themselves in power permanently include congresswoman Elise Stefanik, chair of her party’s House conference, and JD Vance, the Donald Trump-approved Republican nominee to represent Ohio in the US Senate. After the Buffalo shooting, the pair are among those receiving blowback for encompassing the conspiracy theory that the killer referred to repeatedly in an online manifesto authorities believe he posted to justify the attack. Citing “despicable” Facebook advertisements promoting great replacement theory Stefanik utilized in 2021, in which she said “radical Democrats are planning their most aggressive move yet: a permanent election insurrection,” the Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger blasted his House colleague. “Did you know: @EliseStefanik pushes white replacement theory? The #3 in the house GOP @Liz_Cheney got removed for demanding truth. @GOPLeader should be asked about this,” he said in a tweet, referring to Wyoming Republican Cheney’s ousting by House minority leader Kevin McCarthy over her place on the 6 January panel. Kinzinger, of Illinois, is the only other Republican on the House committee looking into Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn his election defeat to Joe Biden. He also attacked Stefanik this week for a tweet in which she accused Democrats of being “pedo grifters” – meaning pedophiles – for providing baby formula for immigrant babies at the southern border during a national shortage. Meanwhile Vance, who credits the former president’s endorsement for helping him to victory in last week’s Ohio primary, is another vocal exponent of the discredited theory. “You’re talking about a shift in the democratic makeup of this country that would mean we never win, meaning Republicans would never win a national election in this country ever again,” he claimed at a campaign event in Portsmouth last month. Josh Mandel, who was defeated by Vance, went even further in an interview on Breitbart in October. “This is about changing the face of America, figuratively and literally. They are trying to change our culture, change our demographics and change our electorate. This is all about power,” he said, without acknowledging that only US citizens can vote, and the path to citizenship can take legal immigrants many years. In a study of the history of great replacement theory in Republican circles, Vice notes that it “isn’t new to American politicians”. In 2017, the Iowa congressman Steve King, a fierce Trump loyalist, said in a tweet: “We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies”. Arguably the biggest rightwing apologist for great replacement theory, however, is Carlson, the Fox News host. On his show last year, he stated: “Demographic change is the key to the Democratic Party’s political ambitions. In order to win and maintain power, Democrats plan to change the population of the country.” His “nefarious” stance, the Washington Post columnist Greg Sargent wrote: “exposes the ideological underbelly of the broader right-wing populist nationalist movement that he and his defenders champion.” Buffalo was not the first time a mass shooter with white supremacist motivations had cited great replacement theory. It also featured in the manifesto of a gunman who slaughtered 51 Muslims at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March 2019. After the Christchurch murders, the UK-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a counter-extremist organization, issued a report that found the once-obscure ideology was promoted so effectively by the far right that it became ingrained in political discourse, and that social media references doubled in four years to more than 1.5m Twitter mentions alone. “It’s shocking to see the extent to which extreme-right concepts such as the great replacement theory and calls for ‘remigration’ have entered mainstream political discourse and are now referenced by politicians who head states and sit in parliaments,” Julia Ebner, the report’s co-author, said at the time. The effect of the backlash against US politicians promoting the theory following the Buffalo attack remains to be seen. The pugilistic Stefanik, for example, was not backing down on Sunday, making no mention of the massacre in her home state as she retweeted criticism of Democrats over the baby formula shortage. Her only social media comment to date, a single tweet on Saturday, failed to acknowledge the race of most of the victims, or the circumstances or motivation for the shooting.",News/US news,Scrutiny of Republicans who embrace ‘great replacement theory’ after Buffalo massacre,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/16/buffalo-massacre-great-replacement-theory-republicans
5/16/2022,"Ayoung woman sits on the stairs, hair scraped back, lower lip trembling. She starts to talk about being slapped in the face, and something about the words is instantly familiar. They’re taken from the actor Amber Heard’s gruelling court testimony earlier this month, describing the abuse she claims to have suffered at the hands of her ex-husband, the film star Johnny Depp. Only now these words are being mockingly rehashed – and not just by this one account, belonging to a Canadian beauty business owner using the handle @sansanjovs, but across the social media platform TikTok. Exaggerated re-enactments of iconic movie scenes are popular on the site, and the same trick has been used to skewer statements from politicians. But there’s something more disturbing about seeing it applied to a court case involving allegations of domestic violence. Depp is suing his ex-wife in the US for defamation over a newspaper essay she wrote in 2018. Although the Washington Post article named no names, Depp argues it clearly implicated him and that his ex-wife was “not a victim of domestic abuse, she is a perpetrator”; she is countersuing for alleged smears against her. Wall-to-wall coverage of this case, televised in the US and live-streamed worldwide on YouTube, will have reawakened painful memories for many survivors. Yet for some on social media, the sight of Heard breaking down on the witness stand as she accused her ex-husband of sexually assaulting her with a bottle (claims he denies) seems to be just another form of entertainment, a juicy box set or episode of Love Island to be chewed over with friends. Posts debunking supposed inconsistencies in Heard’s evidence have gone viral, alongside footage of a Starbucks in California that reportedly put out two tip jars – one labelled with Heard’s name, the other Depp’s – so customers could “vote” for their favourite, as if on a reality TV show. While Depp’s jar appears stuffed with dollar bills, Heard’s looks forlornly empty. As the psychologist Dr Jessica Taylor, of the anti-victim-blaming group Victim Focus, tweeted last week: “The fact that a man going into court to face his ex-wife giving extremely graphic testimony of sexual assault and abuse is met with gifts, fans, banners, women crying and men high-fiving him is pretty jaw-dropping no matter your views on this case.” Perhaps it’s the sight of two Hollywood actors facing off on screen that has encouraged this sense of almost theatrical unreality, with Depp’s team dismissing Heard’s testimony as “the performance of her life”. But few of those sharing the Twitter hashtags #Justiceforjohnny or #amberheardisaliar seem bothered that two years ago Depp lost a libel case over an article in the Sun claiming he was a “wife-beater”, with a British judge ruling the story to be “substantially true”. Teenagers getting their news from TikTok memes or out-of-context clips on Instagram, meanwhile, may have no idea of the longer legal history. And while this excruciatingly public trial is in some ways uniquely American – British courtrooms aren’t televised, sexual assault victims here have a right to anonymity, and witnesses in domestic abuse cases can testify from behind screens – British domestic violence campaigners now fear the public mockery of Heard risks deterring victims here from coming forward, for fear of being belittled and disbelieved. “A woman recounting [what she claims is] her experience of domestic violence in itself is traumatic for many survivors. But that evidence being not just denied, but ridiculed, is deeply harmful and humiliating,” says Ruth Davison, chief executive of the domestic violence charity Refuge. “This is a real trial. The humorousness [around] what’s actually deeply offensive worries me.” Whatever the ultimate verdict in this case, the public response to it sheds a disturbing light on how misogyny persists even in a supposedly “woke” generation. For many working in the field, that response illustrates some wearily familiar tropes: that if it was really so bad she should have left sooner (on average it takes seven attempts before a woman leaves an abusive partner, according to Refuge); that she’s a “crazy ex”, seeking attention or a hefty divorce settlement; that he is so likable he couldn’t possibly have done it. Yet it’s far from unusual, Davison says, for perpetrators to seem “nice”. “These are all characteristics of abusers – that they can lovebomb you, that they’re incredibly charming.” And, while well-loved celebrities may seem more likely to enjoy the benefit of the doubt, she points out that in real life victims themselves can initially find it hard to acknowledge that the man they love is abusive, telling themselves his behaviour was simply out of character. Perhaps the most pervasive trope, however, is that there is such a thing as a “model” victim against whom others can – and should – be judged. Heard has been criticised for crying too much, or not crying enough; one popular online theory is that her occasional glances in Depp’s direction and his reluctance to make eye contact show he’s more frightened of her than the other way round. London’s victims commissioner, Claire Waxman, is a regular observer of family courts. She frequently meets abuse survivors and has been the victim of stalking in the past. There is, she says firmly, no such thing as a typical way to behave on the witness stand. “Some victims are completely devoid of any emotion, and that doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. They are disconnected – it’s quite a normal response to trauma. Whereas others can’t even put a sentence together because they’re crying so much, and that’s normal, too.” But when Waxman tweeted that she had found aspects of the public response to the case “nothing short of shocking”, she was bombarded with comments accusing her of being “trash”, or “schizophrenic like her”. (A psychologist hired by Depp’s team gave evidence that she had diagnosed Heard as suffering from a borderline personality disorder and so-called histrionic personality disorder, only for the psychologist hired by Heard’s team to testify that she had diagnosed instead post-traumatic stress disorder triggered by abuse). The suggestion that survivors are mentally unstable is also familiar, says Waxman, with even problems triggered by the abuse itself sometimes twisted and weaponised against women in court. “It’s quite common for women who allege abuse in the family courts to be told they’ve got personality disorders, they’re mentally unwell, they’re unbalanced. It’s misunderstanding the impact of abuse, the response to it and the trauma that they may have.” The minimising and mockery of Heard’s allegations online are already, Waxman thinks, making women hesitate over reporting similar stories. “It feels like we’re undoing years of work. I’ve been contacted by victims who are deeply distressed by the coverage, and professionals supporting victims who are really questioning ‘Am I worthy of being believed? Would I want to disclose and get that response that [we’re] seeing?’” “I’ve had pushback from some people saying: ‘Well, if she made a false allegation then we have to call it out’,” says Waxman, “but it’s fuelling the misconception that false allegations of abuse and sexual abuse are rife. They’re not.” Home Office research suggests only around 3% to 6% of rape allegations are false, she says; in such cases the truth should be established by police and courts in possession of all the evidence, not amateur trial by social media. While Waxman praises the government’s recent “Enough” campaign, encouraging Britons to challenge coercive and abusive behaviour where they see it in public, she worries about teenagers’ broader attitudes being shaped by the virulent attacks on Heard by Depp supporters. Men’s rights activists have also been vocal in support of the Pirates of the Caribbean star, and see this case as opening wider conversations about divorce or illuminating the plight of battered men. (The 2018 ONS Crime Survey for England and Wales found 4.3% of men experienced domestic abuse in the previous year, compared with 7.5% of women, although men were less likely to report it to police; according to the separate Scottish Crime and Justice Survey, most perpetrators of domestic violence against men were female.) More startling, however, is that many of the Heard-baiters on social media or fans mobbing Depp outside court are young women closer to Heard’s age of 36. To Davison, that’s not so surprising. “We live in a misogynistic world, and therefore what we accept is normal, what we think is normal, is misogynistic, whether we’re male or female.” Arguably, the pro-Depp hashtag #abusehasnogender, shared online by both men and women, may also have particular resonance for younger people used to rejecting crude gender stereotypes. Certainly one thing that makes this case particularly incendiary is that Heard herself was arrested in 2009 on suspicion of assaulting her then girlfriend, Tasya van Ree. All charges were dropped and van Ree has subsequently insisted Heard was “wrongfully” accused, by police who “misinterpreted and over-sensationalised the incident”. But a recording played in court of Heard apparently admitting to hitting Depp has also prompted widespread debates about whether so-called mutual abuse – where both partners are violent towards each other – genuinely exists, or whether it’s an accusation largely levelled by perpetrators to muddy the waters. Without passing judgment on what may or may not have happened in this particular marriage, Davison says domestic abuse classically involves an imbalance of power, allowing one partner to control the other. “We don’t subscribe as Refuge to the idea that a relationship is abusive – that starts to muddle things. A perpetrator can be abusive, and it is always a perpetrator’s choice to abuse. I think once you start to call a relationship abusive or toxic, it starts to apportion blame to the victim.” She adds: “What’s also commonly known in domestic abuse is the concept of DARVO – the perpetrator Denying, then Attacking, then Reversing the Victim-Offender role.” The key lesson Davison draws from the furore surrounding the trial, however, is social media’s growing role in amplifying abuse and manipulation. It’s rare now for reports of domestic violence not to include attempts to threaten, humiliate or pursue victims online, says Davison, and persuading tech platforms to take down more subtle forms of harassment isn’t always easy. Posting a picture of a woman standing outside her own house, for example, might seem harmless – but not if the message is that an abuser knows where she now lives. Davison recalls the story of a woman who went on one date with a man she met via a dating app, in a public place well away from home. “She didn’t want to see them again. But they managed to identify where she lived by cyberstalking effectively, [using] information that was in the public domain, and started posting photos on social media of her front door. You can’t say how terrifying that must be, and yet that is an everyday experience that we’re finding.” Refuge now has a specialist tech team that can help survivors get abusive material taken down, working closely with the major platforms. But Davison is hoping an online safety bill being taken through parliament by the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, which seeks to regulate behaviour deemed “legal but harmful”, could strengthen such protection. And in the meantime, what would she like abused women following the case to know? “If you’re feeling distressed by this, if it’s making you realise your own situation is abusive, if you’re feeling retraumatised – Refuge does believe you. We are here for you.” It may be some time, sadly, before the rest of society can say the same. In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Women’s Aid.

Raging at her own loss, the black-clothed woman snuffs out the lives of children – seemingly needing no more motivation than that someone close to them has been unlucky enough to see her. Beneath the surface is a real primal fury, and Hill skilfully dresses up her narrative with the familiar trappings of an Edwardian ghost story. There are plenty of cosy fires as well as the requisite chills and sea mists. Sam Jordison In Richard Strauss’s brutal single-act opera, Elektra, the titular lead is furiously obsessed with avenging the death of her father, Agamemnon, and seeks to kill his murderers: Klytaemnestra (Elektra’s mother), and her lover Aegisth. She hopes her siblings might feel equally bloodthirsty, yet she can’t be sure about her brother Orest (who lives far away), and struggles to persuade her sister, whose outlook is more tolerant. Orest, feared dead, later arrives and slays both killers, but, after a fit of berserk dancing, Elektra drops dead, robbed of the personal retribution she sought so fanatically.

5/16/2022,"It isn’t every day the Chinese community – or Asians for that matter – see their stories writ large in Hollywood. You have The Joy Luck Club in 1993 and, more than 20 years later, Crazy Rich Asians, Shang-Chi, Turning Red, The Farewell and Minari. All great films. More recently, Everything Everywhere All at Once – by the Daniels duo, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert – was released in the US to critical acclaim, but the strength herein lies not in the blockbuster treatment Asian stories have recently benefitted from but in what it says about the Chinese immigrant experience and philosophies from far afield. Beyond the kaleidoscope of multiverse madness, this film distils east Asian philosophies like no other before it. While it may seem that the great stories of Asian immigrant families build on the cornerstone of intergenerational trauma, its heart of Buddhist and Daoist thought is what makes Everything Everywhere truly great. The bagel and the googly eye are two major symbols of this film. Not only is it a surprisingly apt and humorous take on yin and yang, but in the same stroke it explores concepts central to Buddhist philosophy. To boil down more than 2,000 years of Buddhist discourse – it is thought that all things exist only through our perception of said things. Therefore, they are without inherent meaning. They’re empty. This is expressed in the film’s multiverses. When its characters gain the power to manifest all the potentialities of their lives, they quickly realise that when every phenomenon and concept you can think of are smooshed together, it all becomes a smorgasbord of meaningless nothingness – on top of a bagel. It loses inherent value. This is where the bagel’s antithesis – the googly eye – comes in. It says that in the universe of meaningless emptiness there is value, joy and love where we choose to create it. Through the googly-eyed lens, we gain the power to control our infinite emptiness. Waymond (Ke Huy Quan), the dorky husband of Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh), reminds her through simple kindness that there is value where you want to create it and meaning where you choose to see it. In Buddhist thought, it’s our compassion that grounds us – makes us human – and emptiness isn’t the mark of nihilism and despair but an opportunity to leave behind the bad and cherish the good. At least, in very simple terms that is what Buddhism aims for. Unfortunately, these points are often missed by a western audience and even the near wall to wall positive coverage of this film barely touches on its philosophical significance. In a roundabout way, it’s wholly emblematic of Hollywood’s dismissiveness of Asian achievements and stories. One of the film’s stars, James Hong, who plays a grandfather referred to only as Gong Gong, is a veteran of Hollywood, with more than 650 acting credits under his belt. But he only received his Hollywood Walk of Fame star this year after a GoFundMe campaign launched by fellow Asian-American actor Daniel Dae Kim. Actually, you might recognise another one of the film’s stars, Ke Huy Quan, if he were 30 years younger. In the 1980s, Quan was best known for being Indiana Jones’s sidekick Short Round and then went on to play Data in The Goonies. The former child actor told People that he was “waiting for the phone to ring” but it never did. With few roles for Asian actors at the time, he decided to step away from acting. It was only after watching Crazy Rich Asians that he realised he wanted to get back in the game. The overt examples of Asians getting short shrift in the media aren’t hard to find, whether it be Marlon Brando or Mickey Rooney in yellow-face or Kunal Nayyar being the butt of many ethnic jokes in The Big Bang Theory. But it’s the more subtle examples that shortchange Asian excellence when it’s at its highest. The Farewell and Minari are victims of these, having been designated foreign-language films despite being produced and cast mostly in America. And going back to the black-and-white era, many a role was denied Anna May Wong due to the racial laws of the time. Beyond being entertainment, or even allowing us an insight into the psyches of millions of people across the globe, Asian immigrant stories are valuable if you engage with them. As Asian hate crime rises in the United States and tensions flare between China and Australia, understanding the Asian psyche has never been more important. And with all things fraught with uncertainty in this world, it helps to broaden our philosophical appetite if we appreciate the people and things around us in a different light.",Arts/Film,The west misses the point of Everything Everywhere All at Once – it gets the Asian psyche,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/16/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-asian-hollywood-film
5/16/2022,"Great Britain’s energy regulator has confirmed it is planning to update the energy price cap four times a year from October to allow it and consumers to adjust more quickly to volatile markets. Ofgem on Monday published a consultation on proposals to introduce new reviews of the price cap in January and July, adding to existing changes in April and October. The proposals came after a period of turmoil on global energy markets pushed up gas prices in the UK and across the world – becoming a driving force in global inflationary pressure. The price increases were prompted by the snap-back in global energy demand after coronavirus lockdowns followed by the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, Europe’s biggest gas supplier. In response in April average Great British prices rose by a record 54% to £1,971. A further increase is expected to as much as £2,600 for the winter. The scale of the price rise – and the collapse since September 2021 of 29 British energy suppliers who failed to hedge appropriately – has prompted scrutiny of Ofgem’s role, and the ways that it could help consumers further. Jonathan Brearley, the Ofgem chief executive, said: “Today’s proposed change would mean the price cap is more reflective of current market prices and any price falls would be delivered more quickly to consumers. “It would also help energy suppliers better predict how much energy they need to purchase for their customers, reducing the risk of further supplier failures, which ultimately pushes up costs for consumers. “The last year has shown that we need to make changes to the price cap so that suppliers are better able to manage risks in these unprecedented market conditions.” The proposals announced on Monday also included tweaks to the methodology of working out the price cap that the regulator hopes will result in energy suppliers being able to recover costs during unusual market conditions. Ofgem argued that without these changes fewer energy suppliers would remain in the market, meaning it would be “unlikely that there will be the investment needed for the net zero transition”.",News/Business,Energy price cap to be updated four times a year under Ofgem plan,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/16/energy-price-cap-ofgem-price-falls
5/16/2022,"A former president of the Pacific nation of Kiribati has blasted the influence of the fossil fuel lobby in Australia and the “politicisation” of climate policy, issuing a plea for leaders to adopt a “more moral” stance to cut emissions. In a forthright speech five days before the Australian election, Anote Tong called for a proper understanding of what the climate crisis means to countries like Kiribati, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands, saying “our survival is on the line”. Tong, who was the president of Kiribati from 2003 to 2016, called on Australia to curb coal exports. “It doesn’t stand to reason that if a country cuts back its emissions but continues to export emissions that it’s doing its part,” he told a Smart Energy Council event on Monday. “I know that it is an open secret that the fossil fuel industry is very much involved in the lobbying process, but it’s always been my hope that our first loyalty as leaders would be to the people, rather than the very few who might benefit from the fossil fuel industry.” The Morrison government is seeking re-election on Saturday with a commitment to net zero emissions by 2050, but the issue has caused internal divisions within the Coalition, and it insists the Tony Abbott-era pledge to cut emissions by 26% to 28% by 2030 is “fixed”. Labor is pledging to increase that medium-term target to 43% and take the Pacific’s concerns about climate seriously. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has said the election is a chance to “end the climate wars” because major business, farming and union groups have lined up to support the party’s climate policy. But both major parties have stopped short of promising to curb coal exports, relying on global standards which say emissions are counted in the country where the fossil fuels are burned. Tong did not weigh into the election contest, but issued a broader call for stronger action. He said it was “very welcome” that Australia had embarked on an active program to increase the use of renewable energy, but “there is always this thread of its participation in the export of coal”. In a virtual appearance at an emergency Pacific climate security summit in Canberra, he called for “a genuine and sincere commitment to cutting back” emissions. “I’d like to hope that not only Australia, but the global community can come to terms with what’s happening, and be more moral, be more responsible to what is happening rather than pushing it aside,” Tong said. “One of my biggest disappointments has been the politicisation of climate change whenever there is a different government, different administration coming in, in Australia, in New Zealand, its policies on climate change.” Tong said global heating was “the major challenge facing the Pacific Island countries, especially the low lying atoll countries” which were “on the very frontline of the climate change challenge”. But he said the effects were not confined to Pacific island countries, noting Australia’s Black Summer bushfires in 2019-20 and the flooding disasters this year. “I think what’s so unfortunate is the inability of our leaders to be able to connect what the science says with what is happening on the ground,” Tong said. He said last month’s statement by the Pacific Elders Voice group – including Tong – in the wake of the security deal between China and Solomon Islands “must not be construed as supporting that agreement”. The statement said growing military tension in the Pacific region “created by both China and the United States and its allies, including Australia, does little to address the real threat to the region caused by climate change”. Tong said on Monday: “Our intention was simply to reaffirm that, for the Pacific island countries, the greatest security challenge is not the superpower rivalry but the climate change challenge.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor’s spokesperson for international development and the Pacific, Pat Conroy, said Australia needed to be a “true partner” to countries in the region. He emphasised Labor’s election pledge to seek to host a UN conference of the parties (Cop) in partnership with Pacific countries. “We know this may lead to some uncomfortable conversations in Australia and may lead to some tough debates within the policymaking circles,” Conroy said at the same event. “But it’s very important because I think the symbolism of it is incredibly powerful. The Pacific islands community is probably the region of the world most exposed to climate change – climate change that they have not contributed to.” Climate policy has not figured prominently in the major parties’ election campaign statements, although the foreign minister, Marise Payne, defended the government’s record at a foreign policy debate on Friday. Payne told the National Press Club debate that Australia was “dealing in outcomes, not ambitions” and the government’s net zero by 2050 commitment “was overwhelmingly welcomed by our partners in the [Pacific] region”. “I am not suggesting that they don’t seek more … but our support is practical and it is helpful,” Payne said. The shadow foreign minister, Penny Wong, said Labor’s pledge for a 43% cut on 2005 levels by 2030 was “a responsible, but ambitious target” and she accepted the need to respect the views and experiences of Pacific island countries.",News/Australia news,Former Kiribati president slams Australia’s ‘politicisation’ of climate action and power of fossil fuel lobby,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/former-kiribati-president-slams-australias-politicisation-of-climate-action-and-power-of-fossil-fuel-lobby
