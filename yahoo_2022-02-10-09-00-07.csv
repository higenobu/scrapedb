2/10/2022,"Sen. Ted Cruz pushed back on Republicans who call January 6 an ""insurrection."" ""It is a mistake for Republicans to repeat the political propaganda,"" he told CNN's Ted Barrett. Cruz previously called the Capitol riot a ""terrorist attack"" but has since rejected that language. Sen. Ted Cruz on Wednesday criticized his Republican colleagues who have called the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot an ""insurrection,"" a day after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell described the attack as a ""violent insurrection."" ""I think it is a mistake for Republicans to repeat the political propaganda of Democrats and the corporate media,"" the Texas Republican told CNN's Ted Barrett. The senator also pushed back on the phrase ""armed insurrection"" being used by Republican leadership to describe the attack, CBS News' Scott MacFarlane said. In the aftermath of the Capitol riot, Cruz condemned the violence as a ""terrorist attack"" and repeatedly used that language to describe the day's events. But last month, when Cruz again called the Capitol riot a ""terrorist attack,"" he walked back that language after widespread backlash from conservative figures, including the Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Cruz appeared on Carlson's nightly show to apologize for his characterization of the events, saying: ""I agree it was a mistake to use the word yesterday because the Democrats and the corporate media have so politicized it."" The Texas senator is part of a growing chorus of Republicans who have sought to minimize the riot or shift attention away from it. More recently, the Republican National Committee voted to censure GOP Reps. Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney, two members of the House select committee investigating the riot. The censure resolution described the committee as a ""Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse."" The move triggered outcry from Democrats and some Republican lawmakers who rejected the RNC's description of January 6 and the censure vote. ""We were all here. We saw what happened. It was a violent insurrection for the purpose of trying to prevent the peaceful transfer of power after a legitimately certified election from one administration to the next,"" McConnell told reporters on Tuesday. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine also criticized the RNC's decision, telling reporters on Monday: ""Every moment that is spent relitigating a lost election or defending those who have been convicted of criminal behavior moves us farther away from the goal of victory this fall."" More than 760 people have been charged in connection with the Capitol riot, when crowds of Trump supporters violently stormed the building, which resulted in hundreds of injuries and several deaths.

2/10/2022,"Dave Chappelle threatened to pull his various business ventures from his hometown of Yellow Springs, Ohio, if the village council went ahead with a plan to build — wait for it — more affordable housing in the area. As the Dayton Daily News reports, Yellow Springs had been working with Oberer Homes on a new development project that was set to include a mix of single-family homes, duplexes, and townhouses; Oberer was also set to donate an additional 1.75 acres to the town where more affordable housing could be built in the future. But thanks to opposition from Chappelle — who threatened to pull his business ventures from Yellow Springs if the plan moved forward — and other members of the Yellow Springs community, the council rejected the proposal Monday night, Feb 7, and instead went with the original plan: 143 single-family homes with a starting price of about $300,000.

At the council meeting Monday, Chappelle bandied about the heft “$65 million a year company” as he threatened to axe his own business ventures. “I cannot believe you would make me audition for you,” Chappelle said. “You look like clowns. I am not bluffing, I will take it all off the table.” Chappelle, as the Yellow Springs News previously pointed out, lives near the proposed development site. He and others who have opposed the plan have raised concerns over increased traffic, a lack of sidewalks, and the general setup of the development. At a council meeting last December, Chappelle stated he was “adamantly opposed” to the project, and added, “I’ve invested millions of dollars in town. If you push this thing through, what I’m investing in is no longer applicable. I would say that Oberer can buy all of this property from me if they want to be your benefactor because I will no longer want to.” A representative for Chappelle did not immediately return Rolling Stone’s request for comment.

2/10/2022,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) attempted a souped-up attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Tuesday, but it created a reaction she did not see coming. It happened while the controversial congresswoman was being interviewed by OAN host Dan Ball on his Rumble podcast about recent claims made by Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas) that the Capitol Police secretly took photos of documents in his office. She attempted to compare the police’s investigation to the work done by the Gestapo, Adolf Hitler’s secret police, during World War II. However, she may have failed to move hearts and minds, mistakenly referring to the Capitol Police as “Nancy Pelosi’s gazpacho police.” Perhaps the congresswoman was confused, since “Gestapo” and “gazpacho” both have the letters “G,” “A,” “P” and “O” in them. The photo split below may help clear up any confusion. On the left is a photo of Hitler (far right) surrounded by Nazi officials, including Heinrich Himmler (second from left, seated), the head of the Gestapo. On the right is a bowl of a chilled tomato-based soup: gazpacho. Still, Greene’s error did provide the ingredients for some very saucy tweets. Someone went out on a limb and predicted the possible response to Greene’s statement. i live next door to a bunch of late night tv writers and i think i just heard them all collectively orgasm https://t.co/UCfswc2Gnj — Brennan Murphy (@brenonade) February 9, 2022 This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.
