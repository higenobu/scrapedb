2/15/2022,"US sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson has questioned why Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva has been allowed to compete at the Olympics while she was banned for a similar offence. On Monday, the court of arbitration for sport (Cas) ruled 15-year-old Valieva could continue to compete at the Winter Olympics in Beijing despite registering a positive doping test in December. Richardson missed last summer’s Olympics after testing positive for cannabis. Few people regard the drug as performance-enhancing and Richardson said she had smoked to relieve the pain she felt over the recent death of her mother.  Can we get a solid answer on the difference of her situation and mines? My mother died and I can’t run and was also favored to place top 3. The only difference I see is I’m a black young lady. https://t.co/JtUfmp3F8L “Can we get a solid answer on the difference of her situation and mines?” Richardson tweeted on Monday. “My mother died and I can’t run and was also favored to place top 3. The only difference I see is I’m a black young lady.” Richardson’s ban was for 30 days, which meant she missed the Olympic 100m in Tokyo, where she was expected to contend for a medal. Richardson was not the only athlete to greet Cas’s decision with dismay. “How is anyone going to take the women’s event seriously now?” said figure skater Meagan Duhamel, who won team gold for Canada in 2018. “We were just told illegal drugs and abuse are OK. If that is what this sport is about now, I want nothing to do with it. February 14 2022. The day the Olympic spirit died.” In its ruling, Cas said banning Valieva “would cause her irreparable harm”. Last Monday, she produced a brilliant performance to lead the Russian Olympic Committee to team gold in the figure skating. A day later, however, the World Anti-Doping Agency-approved Stockholm laboratory reported that a urine sample taken from Valieva in December contained the banned angina drug trimetazidine. Cas’s ruling was solely on whether the teenager can compete again in Beijing and she could still be banned from competition over the failed test in the coming weeks. She may also be stripped of any medals she wins at these Games.",Sport/Sport,‘The difference is I’m black’: Richardson sees double-standard over Valieva reprieve,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/14/the-difference-is-im-black-richardson-sees-double-standard-over-valieva-reprieve
2/15/2022,"American fans of campy pop music, outrageous outfits and petty geopolitics were able to rejoice on Monday, with the news that the US will soon launch its own Eurovision-style music competition. The extravaganza, prosaically titled American Song Contest, will see musicians from all 50 states, five US territories and Washington DC compete against each other, in a format borrowed from its long-running European cousin.  Beyond the musical offerings, the show presents the mouth-watering prospect of seeing how politically and culturally opposed states rate the musical output of their rivals, a key component of the Eurovision Song Contest’s enduring popularity. Texas and New York represent an early example of how traditionally conservative and liberal Americans could voice their mutual dislike of one another, in a scenario familiar to anyone who has seen countries such as Russia shun western European songs – however pleasant their melodies – over the years. It also represents a chance for states to show their admiration for one another. In Europe the Scandinavian countries tend to award each other high points, while other, more complicated, allegiances exist within countries of the former Soviet Union. In times of geopolitical strife, countries perceived as bad actors have struggled, including the UK following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In the US the anti-mask and vaccine-skeptic crusade led by Ron DeSantis, Florida’s self-advancing governor, could turn people against singers from the Sunshine state. The Eurovision Song Contest has gained millions of fans over the decades, some of whom engage with the contest ironically, since it first launched in 1956. The contest consists of two lesser-watched semi-finals before an all-night final, but the American version, hosted by Snoop Dogg and Kelly Clarkson, will stretch over eight weeks after it begins in March. In the European competition a country’s votes are decided partly by a jury of music industry heads and partly a public vote. NBC, the network which will host American Song Contest, is yet to reveal its exact format. Eurovision has sometimes served as a place for progressive statements. In 1998 Dana International, a transgender singer from Israel, won the contest, and in 2019 two gay men were featured on the broadcast’s kiss cam, delighting supporters of LGBTQ equality. But the contest has also served as an expression of displeasure. In 2016 Ukraine won with a song about Joseph Stalin’s deportation of Crimean Tartars. Russia, which had invaded and annexed Crimea, in Ukraine, two years earlier, was furious. Away from politics, American Song Contest could see a clash of musical styles. The country music popular in parts of the south, defined by its songs about beer and pickup trucks and sometimes traditional roles for women, might be pleasing to Tennessean ears, but it is a genre that fares less well further north. Recent polls, elections and political fights have highlighted the state of America’s yawning societal divides, raising the potential that warring factions could detract from the actual singing and dancing on screen. But the show’s creators insist that music could help America heal in troubled times. “When America is more factionalised than ever and we are dealing with so many issues that divide us, the one [thing] that truly unites us is our culture,” Ben Silverman, the show’s executive producer told the NME. He added, perhaps optimistically: “[American Song Contest] can unite it by celebrating its diversity, its distinctions and in pulling everyone around its love of music and its love of song.”",Arts/Music,Pop and geopolitics: American Song Contest aims to tap Eurovision formula,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/14/american-song-contest-eurovision-pop-politics
2/15/2022,"The Crown Prosecution Service has launched a high court challenge to the decision by a judge last year to let the Euston Tunnellers walk free after their trial. The highly unusual move, which seeks a judicial review of the acquittal of the six HS2 protesters who spent a month in tunnel in front of Euston train station, has led to claims by environmental activists that the CPS is interfering with the right to protest non-violently about the climate emergency.  Charges of aggravated trespass were dismissed last October by district judge Susan Williams. Now the CPS has started judicial review proceedings against the acquittal. The case was heard at Highbury Corner magistrates in north London. A spokesperson for HS2 Rebellion expressed alarm at the CPS’s decision. They said: “In the wake of the government’s policing bill, the decision to review the Euston tunnel case is another ominous attack on our right to protest. This protest was peaceful and proportionate and raised awareness of the unjustifiable cost of HS2 to the environment and to taxpayers.” At the time of theacquittal last year an HS2 spokesperson said they were “bitterly disappointed” with the outcome of the case. The protesters dug a 100ft tunnel network secretly over a period of months and stored up enough food and water supplies to last throughout the subterranean protest. During the tunnel occupation they spent much of their time digging and shoring up the structure they had created. Williams dismissed the charges against the protesters on the basis that HS2 was not carrying out any construction work on the site at the time the charges were levelled against the six. Instead, their aim was to clear the site of protesters and then begin the construction work. She said in court: “There is no evidence of any constructor or construction taking place on the land at that time.” The subterranean environmental protest is thought to be one of the longest in UK protest history. The court heard that the disruption to HS2’s work at the Euston site cost about £3.5m. There were nine activists involved in the tunnel protest, ranging in age from 16 to 48. Two aged under-18 were not charged and a third activist was unwell and unable to attend this week’s court hearing. The environmental activists staged their protest because they believe that the HS2 project is causing environmental damage, including to 108 ancient woodlands. HS2 disputes this and says that according to its assessments, 43 of the country’s 52,000 ancient woodlands will be affected by HS2’s route between London and Crewe, with 80% of the total area of these remaining untouched, meaning just 0.005% of ancient woodland will be lost, a fraction of losses from comparable road projects. While the protesters celebrated “a victory for the right to protest” following last October’s court case they are now facing a new threat from the decision by the Crown Prosecution Service to get their acquittal judicially reviewed. Simon Natas of ITN Solicitors who acted for the Euston tunnel protesters at their trial, said: “My clients were engaged in peaceful, environmental protest. Our view is that they were acquitted entirely properly and that the reasoning of the district judge in the case was unimpeachable. We are surprised that the CPS is challenging that decision and I fully expect that their application will be contested.” A CPS spokesperson said: “We have applied for permission to seek a judicial review into the decision to dismiss charges against six HS2 protesters in October. Our written application will be considered by a judge. If it is granted a full hearing will take place before the high court.” “A wise CPS would be slow to use public funds to judicially review inconvenient court decisions, not least when the policing of protest has become so politicised and judicial review put beyond the reach of ordinary citizens,” said Labour peer Shami Chakrabarti, previously director of Liberty. “Court decisions, like protests, can be annoying to those in authority, but the ‘one law for them’ approach is exploding public trust in criminal justice. Prosecutors are supposed to be servants of the public and our courts. Maybe they should prioritise bringing sex offenders to justice and winning back the confidence of women and girls?”",News/UK news,CPS challenges HS2 Euston tunnellers trespass acquittal,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/14/cps-challenges-hs2-euston-tunnellers-trespass-acquittal
2/15/2022,"Florence residents are being asked to pay the utility bills of elderly people living alone and struggling to make ends meet as the city’s leaders seek to shield the most vulnerable from soaring energy costs. The “adopt a bill” initiative begins in the next few days and comes as the social implications of the more than 50% hike in gas and electricity bills in Italy this winter start to manifest.  “The social impact is very strong as we’re facing huge increases in bills,” Dario Nardella, the mayor of Florence, told the Guardian. “We’ve received many calls and letters from people who are in great difficulty.” About 27.6% of Florence’s population is over the age of 65, a number that has increased in recent years, with between 30,000 and 33,000 of pensioners living alone. “And many are living below the poverty line, trying to survive off €9,000 (£7,500) a year,” added Nardella. “We have a list of all the people who are enrolled with the social services, and we can’t succeed in helping them all, as much as we will try to, as the council has also been hit by the high energy costs.” Sara Funaro, Florence’s welfare councillor, said the council has 4,000 to 6,000 older people on its social services records, although she estimates the number of those in economic strife could now be higher. “People who might have usually been able to manage, or who had some support, maybe from family, can’t do it any more,” she said. “From their pension they have to pay for rent, food and now these very high bills. We need to give them some serenity.” The donations will be collected online by the Montedomini Foundation, which for decades has assisted elderly people in Florence, and citizens can give as much as they can afford. Since news of the initiative was published by La Repubblica on Sunday, Montedomini has received dozens of messages from individuals and companies wanting to donate. “It’s very impressive,” said Nardella. “The Florentines, when it comes to solidarity, are very responsive.” Florence was among the major Italian cities which last week switched off the lights at famous monuments in a symbolic protest against high electricity costs, which are leaving many of them struggling to pay the bills for town halls and public buildings. ANCI, the association of Italian municipalities, estimates that bills will increase by at least €550m for local councils, out of a total annual electricity expenditure of €1.6bn-€1.8bn. Nardella said that Florence has set aside €7.5m from its 2022 budget for the additional energy costs. The Italian government has endeavoured to ease the burden of gas and electricity bills on families and businesses by so far enacting €5.5bn worth of support measures. The prime minister, Mario Draghi, said last week that the government was preparing a further “far-reaching intervention”.",News/World news,Florence residents being asked to pay utility bills of struggling pensioners,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/florence-residents-being-asked-to-pay-utility-bills-of-struggling-pensioners
2/15/2022,"When the hot young comics from Saturday Night Live spilled over into cinema in the late 1970s, they needed film-makers who could marshal their unruly talents. That task fell to John Landis, Harold Ramis and especially to Ivan Reitman, who has died aged 75. Having produced the off-Broadway National Lampoon show, featuring some of the future SNL stars (John Belushi, Bill Murray, Gilda Radner), Reitman was well placed to launch them on the big screen. He developed and produced Landis’s raucous hit National Lampoon’s Animal House (1978), in which Belushi played the wildest member of a 1960s college fraternity. He also directed Ghostbusters (1984), which combined the tomfoolery of old Abbott and Costello movies with the sort of hip, scornful attitude personified by Murray.  Reitman had previously directed the actor in Meatballs (1979), set at a teenagers’ summer camp, and the army comedy Stripes (1981), in which the bumbling US military end up invading Czechoslovakia (the director’s birthplace). High-brow these films were not – one scene in Stripes took place at a topless mud-wrestling contest – but they captured a new generation of comic talents whose carefree irreverence was distinct from the countercultural provocation of Lenny Bruce or the jangling intensity of Richard Pryor. Nowhere was this more evident than in Meatballs, where Murray, as one of the camp’s counsellors, leads his young wards, who are facing a sporting defeat, in chanting, “It just doesn’t matter!” The genius of Ghostbusters lay in combining this comedy movement with cutting-edge special effects and family-friendly entertainment. Ramis and Dan Aykroyd began writing the film in 1981 as a vehicle for Belushi. When he died of a drug overdose the following year, Ramis and Aykroyd took the script to Reitman, who pointed out the budgetary obstacles in their universe-hopping, time-travelling adventure, and encouraged them to relocate it to present-day New York instead. Murray filled Belushi’s role as the most sardonic of a quartet of parapsychologists turned ghost hunters, and the film earned almost $300m worldwide, spawning an animated television series as well as a sequel and several spin-off movies. Reitman directed Ghostbusters II (1989) and produced the others, including the recent Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021), which was directed by his son, Jason. He was born in Komárno, in what is now Slovakia: his father, Ladislav, owned a vinegar factory and had been part of the Czechoslovak resistance during the second world war; his mother, Klara, had survived Auschwitz. To escape the postwar communist regime, they fled to Vienna in the hold of a barge when Ivan was four, eventually reaching relatives in Toronto. Ladislav started his own dry-cleaning business in the city. Ivan was educated at McMaster University, in Hamilton, Ontario, where he made his first short films and met many of the future stars of Canadian comedy, including Rick Moranis, who later starred in Ghostbusters. He directed the comedy Foxy Lady (1971) and the horror spoof Cannibal Girls (1973). He also co-founded the Toronto Film Co-op with the director David Cronenberg, and was among the producers of Cronenberg’s early horror films, Shivers (1975) and Rabid (1977). His first encounter with Murray during the National Lampoon stage rehearsals in 1975 was an awkward one, as he told the Guardian last year: “I made the mistake of thinking I could be creatively helpful and had the temerity to say: ‘Hey, why don’t you …’ And Bill immediately came over and put his arm around me, took me over to where the coats were hanging, grabbed my scarf, wrapped it dangerously tightly around my neck and said: ‘Hey man, thank you for dropping in.’ He ushered me out of the room without any force, but he had force within him.” Reitman learned how to harness and shape improvisatory performances on film. “There’s a moment when the actors can say anything they want,” he said in 1993, “and then, part of the fun for me as a director is to take that raw work and just structure it and rework it and make it conform to the character work and to the plot, which is evolving as well. It’s a way of being a co-writer of a movie as it’s being shot. But it doesn’t allow for the same kind of focused direction and polished style that leads to much recognition for the creator of the film.” The suspicion that he had not been given his proper due was one with which he wrestled throughout his life. “With comedy, people tend to think that you just get some funny guys in a room, turn the camera on and ‘Boom!’ whereas I like to think I had something to do with it,” he said in 2001. “It’s more than just organisation, you know. It’s a perspective and a tone that I applied judiciously.” Later movies, such as the humdrum caper Legal Eagles (1986), starring Robert Redford, rarely met the same standards of quality control. One exception was the witty and likable Dave (1993), with Kevin Kline as both the US president and the everyman lookalike who replaces him in the White House when he falls ill. Sigourney Weaver (who had starred in the first two Ghostbusters films), Frank Langella and Ben Kingsley rounded out Reitman’s most illustrious cast. The director could also be credited, or perhaps blamed, with helping to reinvent the action hero Arnold Schwarzenegger as a comedy star. (The actor had approached him and said: “You’re that Ghostbusters guy. I could be a Ghostbuster.”) Their first two collaborations – Twins (1988), in which Schwarzenegger and the physically dissimilar Danny DeVito played long-lost siblings, and Kindergarten Cop (1990) – were popular. Junior (1994), in which Schwarzenegger fell pregnant, was not. “Young men were pissed off that I had taken this macho icon and turned him on his head,” the director said. “I had crossed the line.” Fathers’ Day (1997), with Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, and the science-fiction comedy Evolution (2001) also failed to recapture his earlier magic. His last directing credit was on Draft Day (2014), a sports drama starring Kevin Costner. He is survived by his wife, the actor and director Geneviève Robert, and by their children, Jason, Catherine and Caroline.

2/15/2022,"With its beer garden overlooking the ruins of the Roman city of Verulamium, the historic Ye Olde Fighting Cocks pub in St Albans has been pushed to the brink by Covid. Two years of on-off lockdown closures, as well as the wider challenges brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, have taken its toll on the pub which once held a Guinness World Record for the oldest pub in England.  It was announced earlier this month that the pub, which has foundations dating back to the year 793 and hosted Oliver Cromwell for dinner in the 1600s, had served its last pint. But now its landlord, Christo Tofalli, believes the Ye Olde Fighting Cocks could be given a reprieve, urging regulars and its global fanbase to “watch this space”. “It’s a very fluid situation at the moment, there have been lots of phone calls over the past few weeks with people interested in buying the pub,” he told the Guardian. “The pub was a good business before Covid and we are really working hard to find a prospective buyer. We want to get it done as quickly as possible.” Tofalli bought the pub 10 years ago, when it had been sitting derelict for nine months. He said he had been touched by the messages he had received since it was announced the pub was facing closure due to the Covid pandemic. He said: “When I bought it 10 years years ago, it had been derelict for nine months, so to go from that to being one of the best pubs in the country, if not the world, has been an amazing achievement. “We know how special this place is. We connect with our customers and it’s not just the locals, it’s people from all around the world who have been in touch with me. “The messages start expressing great sorrow about the prospect of closure but it’s not long before people start reminiscing and talking about their memories of the place.” He said Ye Olde Fighting Cocks has been operating, in some shape or form, for over 1,200 years, and he has been told “the past 10 have been the best it has ever seen”. On the pub’s future, he added: “Watch this space. We want to put this to bed in the best possible way and hopefully there will be some news very soon.” The pub’s Facebook page was inundated with support from well-wishers when it was confirmed the company, called Ye Olde Fighting Cocks (YOFC) Ltd, had gone into administration. It is being marketed by the auctioneers JPS Chartered Surveyors, with the deadline for expressions of interest set for Monday. A description reads: “A unique opportunity has arisen to purchase the business and assets of Ye Olde Fighting Cocks, a true piece of English history. “Reputedly England’s oldest pub, established in the 8th Century and moved to its current site, a Grade II listed building overlooking the picturesque River Ver, in the 1500s.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Another pint?

2/15/2022,"One of the RAF’s most senior commanders has been suspended from duty after allegations that he exposed himself to neighbours. Air Marshal Andrew Turner is reported to have apologised to neighbours after they said they saw him nude in a paddock at his home in Oxfordshire.  An RAF spokesperson said: “We are aware of a matter involving a RAF officer, which has been subject to a police investigation. The officer has been suspended from duty without prejudice.” Simon Herbert, who lives near Turner, is reported to have said he was concerned for his neighbour’s wellbeing after seeing him outside his house. He contacted Thames Valley police, who started an investigation. The Daily Mail reported that Herbert’s partner and teenage daughter had been left “really upset” after the alleged incident. A detective sergeant is reported to have told Herbert in correspondence: “Mr Turner has accepted the community resolution and the conditions we discussed. Therefore, please expect a written letter of apology to be forthcoming.” However, the family are said to be dissatisfied with the letter, signed with a monogram rather than the air marshal’s name, which they regard as failing to admit the seriousness of his alleged behaviour. A police spokesperson said they were unable to confirm any details. A solicitor for Turner told the Daily Mail the claims were inaccurate and “vexatious”. He said the case had not been prosecuted despite the claims being “the subject of a lengthy police investigation and review by CPS”. Herbert is reported to have said in a witness statement that he was working on a fence when his partner phoned and told him to look into their neighbour’s paddock. He alleged: “I was about 30 metres from Andrew at this point and only had him in my view for a second or so, long enough to realise it was Andrew and he was naked.” He said he was left “wondering if there were any children in the area who may come across Andrew naked”. Herbert added: “Andrew was still in the same corner of his paddock and as I approached I could see his face as he turned towards me and had a look of shock or surprise. I could see that Andrew was fully naked, not even wearing shoes.” The air marshal, whose title is deputy commander capability, has responsibility for key areas of RAF strategy covering human resources, equipment, digital, training and infrastructure. He has served as a helicopter pilot on operational tours in Northern Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Bosnia and Afghanistan, and commanded the special forces aviation wing. He received an OBE in 2003 and a CBE in 2010. Other roles have included head of RAF public relations in the Ministry of Defence and assistant chief of the defence staff (operations).

2/15/2022,"People with children and renters are more likely to have seen their spending on utility bills increase while working from home during the coronavirus pandemic, official figures suggest. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that almost half of people who worked from home had spent less than they would have normally, with reduced costs for travel and food offset by an increase in spending on gas, electricity and internet access.  However, it said the change in spending patterns was more pronounced for some people in the survey of more than 3,000 adults in Great Britain undertaken by government statisticians last month. As many as 92% of people working from home who live in rented accommodation reported increased spending on utilities, compared with 86% for home workers who were paying a mortgage and 77% for those who owned their homes outright. It also found people working from home with children were more likely to report increased spending on food, utilities and internet access compared with home workers without children. Concerns are mounting over rising energy prices amid Britain’s cost of living crisis, with households expected to see a 54% increase in average gas and electricity bills from April. The government has announced plans to cushion the blow from rising prices, though charities have warned that millions of families will still be pushed into fuel poverty. The ONS said overall rates of home working rose during December and January as more people stayed indoors due to the Omicron variant. However, rates remained significantly lower than earlier in the pandemic. From 29% in September – the lowest since the pandemic began – the proportion of working adults who said they had worked from home at least once in the previous seven days rose to 36% in January. Home working rates peaked at 49% in early June 2020. Despite higher utility costs, almost half (46%) of people said they had spent less money as a result of working from home in January – a proportion similar to the ONS survey in November (49%). Half said they had spent less on fuel and parking for commuting, while 40% said they had spent less on public transport. The ONS said the percentage of people working from home correlated with the stringency of Covid-19 restrictions and consumer spending, suggesting a link between working from home and reduced spending in shops, pubs and restaurants. Sarah Coles, a senior personal finance analyst at the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said people working from home “could be in for a nasty shock” when they go back to the office because of rising petrol and diesel prices and living costs. “There are always some exceptions to the rule, but on average working from home is cheaper,” she said.",News/Business,Home workers in Britain see savings hit by higher utility bills – ONS survey,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/14/home-worker-britain-see-saving-hit-higher-energy-internet-access-bills-ons-survey
2/15/2022,"Governments can’t help themselves when it comes to feeding the media chooks around budget time. With a federal election looming, expect a smörgåsbord. Over the weekend, the Murdoch tabloids delivered front-page froth with news the Morrison government was giving “serious consideration” to halving the beer excise, potentially saving 30-50 cents. Literally, hold my beer.  On Monday, a kind of reverse sweetener appeared in the Nine papers, with “increasing concerns within the government” about the potential end of an offset worth as much as $1,080 a year for taxpayers lest its extension stoke inflation. The latter, about the low and middle income tax offset – dubbed “lamington” for its acronym, LMITO – deserves a closer look. Apart from being a New Zealand dessert purloined by Australians, the lamington, in a fiscal sense, is a temporary tax cut for those earning less than $126,000 a year. Those eligible receive it when they file taxes. As the Grattan Institute noted a year ago, the lamington was meant to be temporary and replaced this year by the so-called stage 2 tax cuts. Richard Denniss, the chief economist at the Australia Institute, says the offset costs the budget about $7bn a year. That sounds like a lot, but it goes to many workers. It compares with the $16bn a year that will mostly go to high-income earners in permanent legislated stage 3 tax cuts from 2024, rising to $30bn by 2030. A hint at why the lamington will almost certainly be extended for another year is that it was doubled in the 2019-20 budget from $530 to $1,080. That was the “back in black” budget wheeled out by a desperate Morrison government declaring it had a secured a surplus just prior to winning re-election in May 2019. “We are baking into our system lower taxes,” the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, told ABC RN Breakfast on Monday, adding piously he was “not going to preempt” what his budget would include or exclude next month. Denniss is highly sceptical Frydenberg has any intention to dump the offset, noting how grim post-budget headlines would look if they took money from the many while locking in largesse for the wealthy starting at $9,000 a year in stage 3 tax cuts. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “How do you get big positive news out of this pre-election budget for leaving things the same?” he says. “Presumably you tell everyone they’re about to lose it – and then go and rescue it.” “The idea that Scott Morrison is going to choose fiscal conservatism over a populist cash splash when they’re this far behind in the polls seems quite unlikely.” A purported reason for not renewing the lamington is that the inflationary hawks at the Reserve Bank are circling. Having that (up to) $1,080 offset for another year would only stoke more spending when consumer prices are starting to heat up, adding to the risk official interest rates will soon rise. Yes, the low and middle earners are more likely to spend that money, but a lot of it would probably go on mortgage repayments rather than goods and services. And if the government was really worried about extra spending, why not avoid dipping into that $16bn honeypot of yet-to-be-announced pre-election splurges? In any case, the RBA governor, Philip Lowe, insists at every turn he’s in no hurry to lift interest rates. Last week, he said he was prepared to watch inflation for “a couple” of quarterly consumer price index “prints”, which takes you out to August at least before the rates button gets pushed. Another serving of lamingtons, in other words, won’t make a difference. Frydenberg, though, wasn’t only talking lamingtons today. He also wanted to highlight analysis “based on unpublished Australian Tax Office data” (reprinted in the Nine papers and repeated on Radio National) that show 5.2m women have enjoyed average tax cuts of $3,130 since the 2018-19 budget. Indeed women under 24 are paying 20% less tax, he says. Cassandra Goldie, the chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Service, said the three-stage tax cuts had been regressive and “claims that young people and women – who mostly have lower incomes – are the main beneficiaries don’t withstand scrutiny”. “The stage 3 tax cuts, which give an extra $180 a week to those with the highest incomes, are especially damaging and inequitable,” Goldie said. These cost $16bn a year, with two-thirds going to men, as they make up that share of the 10-15% of income earners above $120,000 a year. “People on low and modest incomes (and most women) would be better off with an improved income support safety net, lower childcare costs and overdue investment in other essential services,” she said. Labor’s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, took up the theme of the lamington being on the hitlist. “[W]orking families – millions of them – face a tax hike on the first of July, a few weeks after the next election,” he said, adding that “if Australians want cost-of-living relief, they need Labor’s plans for childcare, and cheaper and cleaner energy, and our plans to get wages growing again.” Adam Bandt, the Greens leader, said a permanent wage rise would be better than a temporary tax cut. “While the Greens haven’t stood in the way of support for low-income earners, people would be better off if we lifted wages, taxed the billionaires, made dental part of Medicare and abolished ‘voluntary’ school fees instead,” he said.",News/Australia news,A pre-election splurge: what lamingtons have to do with tax cuts,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/15/a-pre-election-splurge-what-lamingtons-have-to-do-with-tax-cuts

While some must be satisfied with a middle-of-the-table finish and a tribute on grand final day, the most difficult retirements are those that are not on the athlete’s own terms. It isn’t uncommon to see players with a few professional caps succumb to an injury or fail to have their contract renewed, but it is most jarring when it happens to a player who has reached the highest levels of their sport. It doesn’t fit the narrative, it’s not a neat ending to a career that we can tie a bow on and reminisce about at pubs and barbecues for years to come.  Caitlin Bassett’s retirement from netball last week is a prime example of an ending to a career that doesn’t quite sit comfortably. After making her international debut at 20, Bassett cemented her placed in Diamonds’ folklore at 23 when she came off the bench in the 2011 Netball World Cup final and sunk the winning goal. From there she went on to win a Commonwealth Games gold in 2014, another World Cup medal in 2015 and silver medals at both events in 2018 and 2019 respectively, this time as the team’s captain. With 102 caps for the national team, she is not a player who many would have expected to finish her career by fading gently into obscurity. Bassett’s decline began in 2020 when she was forced to the bench for much of the Super Netball season, resulting in an early release from her contract with the Giants and a move over the ditch to New Zealand’s ANZ Premiership for the 2021 season. While she was hoping for a Super Netball return in 2022, she was not offered a contract with any of the eight teams and ongoing knee issues put an end to her plan to take up a training partner position and try to work her way back to the top, instead announcing her retirement from the sport. While sometimes seen as a polarising figure off the court, Bassett’s on-court achievements are indisputable and it is difficult to marry up the highs of her career with its less than glorious conclusion. It raises important issues around athlete transition – particularly for female athletes in the professional era. In years gone by, women worked full-time jobs around their sporting careers and retirement from sport simply meant they finally had a chance to get a full night’s sleep on a regular basis and an ability to use their annual leave for leisure. For professional male athletes – particularly those with as many accolades as Bassett – retirement is often bolstered by a large investment portfolio, a fully paid off property and a plethora of connections in the business and media world to forge a new career. While women’s sport has come a long way in recent years, a situation like Bassett’s highlights the large gap that must still be bridged before gender equality is achieved. In an era that requires female athletes to train as much as their male counterparts and demands standards of athleticism to warrant prime time television slots, how are these women being equipped for life after sport? While female athletes – Bassett included – usually have a degree under their belt by the time they retire from sport, it is difficult to enter the workforce in your mid-30s with a resume filled only with sporting achievements. Bassett is currently pet sitting to pay her rent, a situation that male athletes such as Michael Hooper and Pat Cummins are never likely to find themselves in. Earning a living as an athlete is a privilege afforded to few and one that isn’t taken for granted by the current generation of women who know that it was barely a distant dream for their predecessors. But it is a job that demands more than most – from the physical toll it takes to the obligatory early retirement, the sacrifices sometimes outweigh the benefits. Living out a childhood dream is all well and good, but when children act out their fantasies of slotting last second goals to win World Cups in backyards all over the world, they don’t involve limping into retirement with a body broken from years of training and a desperate search for an entry level office job. When an athlete as decorated as Caitlin Bassett speaks out and illustrates the difficulty of this transition, it provides the opportunity to make amends. To fix the system so that the next generation of women face a gentler incline as they traverse the difficult path to life after sport.",Sport/Sport,Catilin Bassett’s less than glorious ending raises questions over athlete transition | Megan Maurice,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/15/catilin-bassetts-less-than-glorious-ending-raises-questions-over-athlete-transition
2/15/2022,"Economists love people getting busy – and not just at work. Population growth is one of the three keystones of economic growth. According to some, demography is (economic) destiny. Women are doing more than their fair share of nurturing a growing a population. In 2020-21 women accounted for nearly 90% of primary parental leave. Yet 91% of organisations do not discriminate between men and women taking parental leave.  Source You’d think the economy would give them recognition for this service. Alas, that’s not the case. Motherhood means, for most, a hit to pay and progression. Australian women with one child earn 5% less than those with no child. If you have two or more children, the wage penalty rises to 9%. In the US and UK the numbers vary but the story is the same. This persists in retirement. At last count, the median Australian 65- to 74-year-old-woman had a superannuation balance of $200,000 – 20% less than men of the same age. The gap is likely to be larger for mothers, who have the double whammy of no superannuation contributions while on maternity leave and smaller contributions (blame that wage penalty) on their return. The injury isn’t just financial. About 15% of mothers report experiencing discrimination in relation to performance assessments and career advancement while on or requesting parental leave. On the flipside, men seem to get moderate pay bumps along with fist bumps when they become parents. Estimates range between no impact on their pay and a 2% increase. So, let’s get this straight. Women are 2.5 times more likely to take parental leave than men. Yet there’s a wage premium for being a dad and a wage penalty for being a mum. It doesn’t seem to stack up. Why aren’t new dads more likely to take time off? Some of the reasons are pragmatic. Breastfeeding is difficult (though not impossible) for men. Mums need time to recover from childbirth. It follows that women need to take leave after giving birth. If there’s a choice between maternity and paternity leave for a newborn, maternity leave is prioritised. Others reasons are societal. Mothers are often expected to take time off. Whether a woman is taking too much leave or not enough seems to be a popular water cooler conversation. Fathers – not so much. Patriarchal views still argue that men should be breadwinners, not caregivers. The same views argue that men who spend time with their families are less committed to their work. What really gets me, though, are the financial reasons. Birth mothers of newborn children in Australia are entitled by law to up to 18 weeks of paid leave. Birth fathers? Just two weeks of paid leave. Here we have a law which explicitly discriminates against men on the basis of biological sex. In doing so, the law entrenches old social gender roles and expectations. It also has negative impacts across the board. Paternity leave brings a range of benefits – and not just to dads. Kids report feeling closer to fathers who took paternity leave – even years later. Where couples are married, dad taking paternity leave means a lower probability of divorce. There’s a more equal sharing of household tasks, even years after paternity leave has ended. Yes, providing paid paternity leave would involve some cost to taxpayers. But it would also provide an economic boost. It could be the thing which encourages our next baby boom – and our ticket out of a recession. Normally, an increased fertility rate is economic short-term pain (lower participation rates) for long-term gain (bigger population). Equal paid parental leave could provide the latter while mitigating the former. Perhaps counterintuitively, having paid paternity leave could actually increase the number of hours couples are willing to work while they have young children. Paid paternity leave encourages mothers to go back to work earlier. What’s more, couples who share household tasks more evenly are willing to spend more time on paid work. It also incentivises people to become parents. At a time when population growth seems as elusive as economic growth, this is a pretty good deal. Globally, each woman is having fewer children than ever in recorded history. By 2100, the global population will have plateaued, or even begun to decline. Good for the environment, but not great for economic growth (if GDP was all we cared about). I’m far from the first person to advocate for this. The Workplace Gender Equality Agency has long argued for universal, gender-neutral paid parental leave. More than half of Australia’s largest employers already offer gender-neutral paid parental leave on top of government entitlements. Other countries provide equal paid parental leave for fathers. It’s good for women and men both. With the economic sweetener thrown in, it seems like a no-brainer.

2/15/2022,"New Zealand and Australia have announced they will relax the border rules for vaccinated travellers from later this month to the relief of many who have been separated from family and friends for years. Vaccinated citizens and visa holders travelling to New Zealand from Australia will be able to fly there from 27 February and do 10 days of home quarantine, and those who are in other parts of the world can return on 13 March (and then do 10 days of home quarantine). Meanwhile, Australia will open to all fully vaccinated visa holders, including tourists, on 21 February, with no quarantine required.  Four people who have been affected by the countries’ strict border restrictions discuss how it will feel to be reunited with partners, family and friends. The opening of Australia’s borders means that Samantha Law, a 30-year-old Australian national living in Kyrgyzstan, will be able to see her family and friends for the first time in two-and-a-half years. “It’s been pretty difficult. I haven’t lived in Australia for a few years now, but you always know that whenever you need to go back, you can,” she says. “I have an elderly grandmother who’s getting frailer and keeps telling me that she’s definitely going to die before she gets to see me again, which is not very nice to hear.” Law, who works in global health international development and has lived in Kyrgyzstan for two years, says she’ll be “trying not to think too much” about all that she’s missed when she returns to New South Wales in March. “It’s going to be a tearful few weeks in March. A number of really good friends have gotten married … [and] also had children. One friend has even had two children,” she says, adding that her younger brother is also now in a “very serious” relationship with a woman she hasn’t met. After seeing her family, the first thing Law plans to do when she’s back in Australia is swim in the ocean. “Kyrgyzstan is the country furthest from the ocean of any country in the world, and … I grew up on the coast of NSW. So once I see my brother and my parents, then it’ll be a swim in the ocean for sure.” Francesca Scott, a 30-year-old NHS healthcare assistant in North Tyneside, met her fiancee online at the beginning of the pandemic. As the world locked down in 2020, Scott and New Zealand national Tony Smith, a 37-year-old logistic manager working in Auckland, began video calling every day but weren’t able to meet until months later. Smith went over to England in December 2020 and stayed until March 2021, during which time the couple got engaged. “It was just after he left that I found out I was pregnant,” the 30-year-old says. “It was obviously very difficult because we’d spent all that time in each other’s pockets and then he was gone. At that point we weren’t sure when he was going to be able to come back because the borders are still closed and obviously it costs a lot of money.” The easing of New Zealand’s border rules means Smith’s family will finally be able to meet their daughter-in-law and grandchildren – Scott gave birth to twins last November. Smith has applied for a UK visa and the couple plan to get married in May. “It’s [been] a real test of a relationship, but I feel like we’re almost there. It’s not for the faint-hearted. It’ll be really special the day that he lands back in England and we can be together again.” “I didn’t know at the time that I would be unable to return for more than a year,” says Australian author Alicia Wanstall-Burke, who lives in north-west England and is travelling back to Queensland, Australia in March for a month. Thirty-five-year-old Wanstall-Burke arrived in the UK in January 2021 when she came over to marry her fiance, now husband, Graham. She was hoping to return to see her nine-year-old son during his school holidays in September, and again this January, but due to Covid restrictions she was unable to meet the conditions to travel and couldn’t afford to quarantine. “It’s breaking my heart not seeing him,” she says. “We would normally say how many days it would be till we next see each other but we couldn’t do that because he’d get sad when I wouldn’t come home.” She decided to book her flights before Queensland officially announced the changes. She says it was a “huge risk but it’s such a relief”. “The trauma and anxiety of the pandemic still lingers though,” she adds. “I watch the news waiting for the border to slam shut, or for some sort of insurmountable restrictions to be put in place, reducing flights or complicating pre-travel preparations. I’m over planning everything and I’ve got my rapid antigen test already packed.” Jon Albrecht in Cornwall hasn’t seen his parents, brother and sister in Nelson, New Zealand since February 2019. “The feeling of being cut off from family is hard to describe,” says the 47-year-old. Albrecht, who works as a rigger, first came to the UK from New Zealand in 1979 as a child with his family. Since then most of them have moved back to New Zealand. “It’s been exhausting,” he says. “I’m really conscious that I’m not the only one in this situation but I think for many people, the whole pandemic has been very difficult.” He hopes to return to New Zealand at some point this year but doesn’t know yet when. “It means I can visit my brother and my elderly parents who are no longer in the best of health. And I want to embrace my sister who I miss greatly. “It’s hard to put it into words but it feels like the end of something. I guess it just feels like going home.”",News/Australia news,‘It’s going to be a tearful few weeks’: Australians and New Zealanders count down to border reunions,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/15/its-going-to-be-a-tearful-few-weeks-australians-and-new-zealanders-count-down-to-border-reunions
2/15/2022,"Despite growing up under the tyranny of “no hat, no play”, it wasn’t until my late 20s that I started wearing a hat every time I was in the sun (motivated mostly by the threat of accelerated ageing). To make it fun, I started collecting hats from iconic Australian destinations (Bondi Icebergs, Cottesloe beach, Noosa Heads etc). These hats may be the only thing in my wardrobe that are treated appallingly. They are stained by chlorine, sunscreen and salt. They get left at the bottom of beach bags and backpacks, squished between water bottles, books and towels.  Hats should be treated with more care than this, not least because we wear them when braving the elements. But more care does not necessarily mean frequent care, says Hamish McLeod, the store and sales manager for Strand Hatters in Sydney. For fabric and felt hats, a dry clean or hand wash once every six months or so should be enough, unless there are visible dirt, sweat or makeup stains inside it. For those, McLeod says to “use a wet cloth and gently dab the affected areas. But do not wipe”. From there, care instructions vary depending on the kind of hat. From fedoras to ascot caps, McLeod says that “wool is a tough one as it quite easily collects different fibres such as hair and dust”. He recommends purchasing a hat brush and brushing your hat after each use, to “take away any dust or any sort of marks that may discolour your hat”. Alternatively, errant fibres can be removed with double-sided sticky tape or a lint roller. If your hat is out of shape, he suggests steaming it with the boiling water from an iron or a kettle to loosen the fibres and remove wrinkles and creases. Straw is a particularly delicate fibre, so hats made from it need to be handled with extra care. McLeod says one of the worst things you can do to shaped straw hats, such as a Panama or fedora, is taking them off by grabbing them at the front of the crown. The pressure this places on the pointy ends of the crown can cause the straw to break. Instead, you should always take your hat on and off by the brim. Straw also dries out when it is worn in the sun. McLeod suggests using steam to restore a straw hat’s moisture and prevent future breakages. Most caps and bucket hats are made of cotton, but pay attention to the care instructions on your particular hat, as things like embroidery can impact how they should be washed. McLeod suggests hand-washing caps and bucket hats using a bucket of warm water and a small amount of washing powder. “After using your hands to remove any stains or marks, allow it to soak for 10 to 15 minutes before hanging it up to dry.” If the visor of your cap is out of shape, use steam to soften it before bending it back into shape. They may sound old-fashioned, but hat boxes do serve a purpose. They stop your hat collecting dust when you’re not wearing it; alternatively, keeping hats under a plastic cover will do the same job. Wide-brimmed hats should be stored upside-down or on a hat stand to avoid ruining their shape.Outside the home, travelling with hats can be a bit awkward. If you are travelling on an aeroplane, McLeod recommends placing the hat in the bottom of your luggage and building around it. “Fill the inside of the hat with smaller items and stabilise the outside [crown and brim] of the hat with larger items to ensure it cannot be damaged throughout transit.” If you are travelling by train or car, he suggests purchasing a Klipsta hat clip. He says this “accessory allows you to attach your hat to the side or back of your bag or even to the back of your car seat without the hat being affected by its surroundings”. We may be more likely to reach for a straw hat when the sun is out, but McLeod says they don’t always provide the best protection. Since they are made by weaving long strands of straw, “there is always a chance of having small gaps between each weave, ultimately allowing UV rays to hit your skin”. Alternatively, wool hats have UPF50+, but wool can be too hot to wear in the sun for long periods. If you decide to take a wool hat to the beach, McLeod says you’ll need to be careful of salt marks, as they can react with the dyes and cause discolouration. “If you do get your wool or fur felt hat wet, we advise that you use a cloth or towel with some clean water on it and give it a wipe down to remove any salt crystals.” On the other hand, as long as they are properly cared for afterwards, wool hats can handle the rain really well. “When you take it off, make sure you allow it to dry without damaging the shape,” McLeod says.” He suggests the best way to do this is by placing the hat upside-down on its crown.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Tips of the hat: how to keep your headgear in great shape,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/feb/14/tips-of-the-hat-how-to-keep-your-headgear-in-great-shape
2/15/2022,"A social media platform for sex workers with close to half a million users globally has shut down over legal concerns regarding online safety laws and the Australian government’s social media defamation legislation. Switter, which runs on Twitter-replica Mastodon, was set up by an Australian collective of sex workers and technologists, Assembly Four, in 2018 in response to the anti-sex trafficking legislation known as Sesta/Fosta in the United States leading to a number of sites like Backpage shutting down, or platforms banning sex work content.  Switter works as a safe space by, and for, sex workers, with little concern that their content or accounts will be censored. On the site, sex workers can find each other, share safety information, find clients and find out legal information or service availability. “There is no fear that we’re going to need to censor ourselves,” Brisbane-based sex worker Sienna Charles told Guardian Australia. “There is no fear that we’re going to be outed.” However, the managers of the site announced on Monday night that they had decided to shut down immediately, telling its more than 420,000 users the raft of “online safety” and defamation laws in the US, UK and Australia made it difficult to keep the platform running. “The recent anti-sex work and anti-LGBTQIA+ legislative changes not only in Australia, but in the UK, US and other jurisdictions have made it impossible for us to appropriately and ethically maintain compliance over 420,690+ users,” the letter states. The UK is working on bringing in an online safety bill this year similar to that passed in Australia last year. One of the concerns that has led to Switter shutting down is that the Online Safety Act regulates adult content online based on definitions of acceptable content which pre-date the internet. Fetish content, for example, must be removed if a complaint is received. Lobby group Digi had raised questions about this before the legislation passed to no avail. Assembly Four said it showed how difficult it was for smaller social media platforms to navigate the new laws. “If big tech with millions of dollars in funding and access to the best talent are confused by these regulations, how did we or any small business stand a chance?” “Due to the constant sexualisation and fetishisation of the LGBTQIA+ existence, the tools that are purported to protect children and young people online are causing more harm through the normalisation of surveillance and censorship.” Another concern leading to the shut down is the prospect of the government’s so-called social media anti-trolling legislation. The legislation, which will make platforms liable for defamation if they do not help to unmask an account making defamatory comments, would place a platform like Switter in the position of potentially having sex workers or their clients’ anonymity removed in a time when they can still face discrimination from banks, housing and other institutions for the work. “If this law passes … then it means that they could be compelled to give up their users’ information and that’s not something [Switter is] prepared to do, or take liability, which is also not something they’re prepared to do, because that’s very expensive,” Charles said. As the Victorian parliament voted last week to decriminalise sex work, online sex workers were finding that laws ostensibly about improving safety online were making it less safe for them to work and communicate, said Jules Kim, the CEO of Scarlet Alliance. “We’re celebrating decriminalisation in Victoria, and on the other hand we’re seeing our presence in the digital spaces shrinking,” she said. “I think that that is a real, major threat to sex workers and our ability to operate and operate independently.” Charles said there were other private forums and groups that sex workers could turn to, but it wasn’t the same level of openness and communication as Switter had, and there was the constant concern that at any point they could be banned from a platform like Twitter or Reddit without notice. “What ends up happening as a result of things like this is that we have to hop platforms a lot and build up our following again,” she said. “And if you’re even a little bit too spicy online, on Twitter, I’ve had my account deleted before, and to build on 22,000-odd [followers] – and now I’m back at 6,000 – I’m really sad about it. “It impacts your income, having to do that kind of thing again and again and again. And removing Switter just means that now we don’t have a safe place.”",News/Australia news,‘Now we don’t have a safe place’: sex workers’ social media site Switter shuts down amid legal fears ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/15/now-we-dont-have-a-safe-place-sex-workers-social-media-site-switter-shuts-down-amid-legal-fears
2/15/2022,"The immigration minister, Alex Hawke, has been urged to heed Australia’s “moral obligation” to Afghan nationals fleeing the Taliban by ensuring resettlement places are on top of the existing humanitarian intake. A delegation of faith groups, veterans’ advocates and members of the Afghan diaspora met with Hawke in Canberra on Monday to implore him to ramp up assistance after 20 years of Australian military involvement in Afghanistan.  It is understood Hawke did not rule out the option of offering additional places for Afghan nationals. In addition to the request to increase the overall humanitarian intake, the group also argued it was “cruel” for the government to leave Afghan nationals in limbo on temporary protection visas because they had previously arrived in Australia by boat. Hawke announced last month the government would provide “at least 15,000 places for Afghan nationals, through our humanitarian and family visa program over four years”. That “multi-year” figure included 10,000 places for Afghan nationals within Australia’s existing humanitarian program and at least 5,000 visas within the family stream. But the Rev Tim Costello, one of nine members in Monday’s delegation and the executive director of Micah Australia, said the announcement was “mean and tricky” because it did not result in any additional places. Costello said that could be fixed if the government followed the example set by the Abbott government in 2015 when its offer to take 12,000 refugees from the conflict in Syria and Iraq was in addition to the pre-existing humanitarian intake. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The substance of the complaint is that failing to increase the overall global intake means Afghan nationals may, in effect, take the places of individuals from other countries who are also in need of protection. Australia has set an overall limit of 13,750 humanitarian visas for the current financial year. “We can actually open up our hearts and do what Tony Abbott did when he took 12,000 additional Syrians and Iraqis,” Costello said on Monday. “We know that government backbenchers, even some government cabinet ministers, really believe there should be additional places, that this matter isn’t over, and it can be fixed. It should be fixed.” Mariam Veiszadeh, a spokesperson for the Afghanistan-Australian Advocacy Network, said Afghanistan was in “a state of anarchy” and urged Hawke to act. “With the stroke of a pen, it’s that simple – he’s able to save people’s lives,” she said. Veiszadeh said she was hearing from her extended family and other contacts in Afghanistan that the situation “really varies”, but some people with young children were avoiding leaving their homes “out of fear that they could be abducted”. “The way that it’s been put to me is life is not worth living when you don’t know what tomorrow holds, you don’t know what the future of your children holds,” she said. “I get inundated with messages from different people across Afghanistan, who are facing dire situations, and it absolutely breaks my heart.” Afghanistan was a human tragedy, Veiszadeh said, citing Unicef’s estimate that about 1 million children under five were likely to die before the end of 2022. “We have a moral obligation,” Veiszadeh said. “I’ve gotten to the point where I can’t answer phone calls any more when I know they’re coming from Afghanistan, because frankly, I find it really triggering and I don’t know what to say to people.” Veiszadeh said “any bit of hope that we give [people who call seeking help], any glimmer of hope” meant “they’re willing to risk their lives of themselves and their children” to flee the country. As of last month, the Department of Home Affairs had received more than 32,500 applications for the humanitarian program from Afghan nationals on behalf of more than 145,000 individuals. Glen Kolomeitz, a director at GAP Veteran & Legal Services, said he regularly received calls from Australian veterans of the Afghanistan war asking why Australia was not doing more to help the Afghan people. “I’ve had veterans say to me, we’ve got a spare room, we’ve got a holiday house, we’ve got a caravan – send me some Afghan families and they can live with us,” he said. Kolomeitz said the issue was having an effect on the mental health of veterans, who believed it was “painfully obvious that promises weren’t kept”. “We were there for 20 years in that country, 20 years, we cut and run essentially, we left with the rest of the coalition forces, we’ve left that country in a state which we’re seeing now, in a crisis state,” he said. “We owe moral obligation, not just to Afghans who worked for Australian agencies, but to the Afghan people more broadly.” The Australian Christian Lobby’s Wendy Francis said the delegation was also pressing for Afghan nationals who have been in limbo on temporary protection visas for years to be given a pathway to permanent residency. “We’ve got people who are on temporary protection visas, who cannot go back to Afghanistan, we know that,” she said. “It’s cruel actually to keep them still on temporary protection visas as well.” Comment has been sought from Hawke. The delegation also met with Labor shadow minister Andrew Giles, Coalition backbenchers Damian Drum and Russell Broadbent, and independent Rebekha Sharkie.",News/World news,‘Stroke of a pen’: Coalition urged to accept Afghan refugees in addition to existing intake,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/stroke-of-a-pen-coalition-urged-to-accept-afghan-refugees-in-addition-to-existing-intake
