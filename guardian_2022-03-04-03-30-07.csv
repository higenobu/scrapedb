3/4/2022,"Roger Graef, the documentary maker, theatre director and writer who has died aged 85 of cancer, played a major part in holding the criminal justice system to account and was instrumental in changing the ways that victims of rape and domestic violence were treated by the police. He also had a distinguished record in showing the inner workings of organisations ranging from the US Senate and the European Union to the British Communist party and British Steel, and of highlighting injustices, whether in the treatment of children in care or the destruction of our towns and cities. His “fly-on-the-wall” style and his open and genial manner helped him win the trust of the subjects of his many films for the BBC, Granada Television, Channel 4 and ITV in a career spanning more than six decades. His interest in crime and justice led to more than 30 related programmes, including the influential In Search of Law and Order, an investigation into the treatment of young offenders in both the US and UK. His remarkable body of work led to him being the first documentary maker to be awarded a Bafta fellowship for lifetime achievement. Born in New York, the son of Gretchen (nee Waterman) and Irving Graef, a doctor, Roger was educated at Horace Mann, a private school in the Bronx, and the progressive Putney school in Vermont, before taking a BA in English at Harvard. It was there that his career as a director was launched, albeit in the theatre. Many years later, on the eve of the award of his Bafta fellowship he told the Guardian that it was there that his passion for social justice was ignited when he saw how audiences reacted to really challenging material. “All I ever wanted to do all the way through was to make a difference,” he would say. After graduating, he directed more than 20 plays in theatres on the US east coast and embarked on his television career after CBS had spotted his talent and commissioned him to direct The Seven Who Were Hanged, based on the novel by Leonid Andreyev. An anglophile who had visited Britain in order to watch Shakespeare at Stratford-upon-Avon, he was prompted to move there permanently in the early 1960s after seeing a performance of Beyond the Fringe in London on his second night. In 1962 he directed Tennessee Williams’s Period of Adjustment at the Royal Court and in the West End, but his theatre work soon took second place to his documentary career; he became a British citizen in 1995 and was appointed OBE in 2006. His early TV work in Britain dealt with a variety of topics. The award-winning One of Them Is Brett (1965) was about thalidomide children and demonstrated that, despite their physical disabilities, they were as bright as anyone. In the Name of Allah, about a Muslim community filmed in Fez in Morocco in 1970, was an early indication of his wide scope of interests. His curiosity about institutions led to his explorations of governmental bodies; Inside the Brussels HQ (1975) notably featured Stanley Johnson, then working for the European Commission. It was his 1982 series, Police, in which he was given access to the Thames Valley force by its chief constable, Peter Imbert, that would perhaps have the greatest lasting effect. In one programme, male detectives were shown interviewing a distressed rape victim in a dismissive manner. “Stop mucking us all about,” she is told by one disgruntled officer. Twelve million people saw the programme: the outrage it provoked led to Margaret Thatcher saying in parliament that “it was not the way to behave”. Graef said later: “We showed [the film] to the police but they regarded themselves as being nice to her.” He had already been amazed on a visit to Hendon police training college to hear new recruits being told that 60% of women reporting rape were making it up. Forty years later, that segment from the film still has great resonance. Closing Ranks, his 1988 fiction film about how the police handle accusations of violence, addressed issues that also remain just as relevant today. While he will be best remembered for his work on criminal justice, his range was wide. His documentary production company, Films of Record, which he set up in 1979, was responsible for Julien Temple’s highly regarded Requiem for Detroit? (2010). His 2011 BBC Panorama special, The Truth About Adoption, has been credited with the speeding up of adoption processes. Who Cares? (ITV, 2012) exposed the neglect of older people in institutions. Another Panorama special, Kids in Care (2010), and his programmes on Great Ormond Street hospital in London (2010-15) also won plaudits. Murder Blues (2005), which charted the activities of the Met police’s Operation Trident on the issue of black crime, saw him at work on more familiar territory. He also tackled crime and the law in print, most notably through the books Talking Blues: Police in Their Own Words (1989), Living Dangerously: Young Offenders in Their Own Words (1992) and Why Restorative Justice? (2000). He wrote regularly in the media on the issues. In a prescient article for the Guardian in 2018 he noted: “Until, and unless, resources are found to restore community policing, to provide legal aid for those caught up in the justice system, and for prison officers to do more than lock people up for most of every day, the criminal justice system is at risk of creating more damage than it prevents.” He was generous with his knowledge and experience and willing to participate rather than just criticise from outside. This led to his membership of the independent advisory group on race for the Met police and his involvement in leading roles for such diverse organisations as the Institute of Contemporary Arts, Prisoners Abroad and the board of London Transport, for which in 1981 he co-designed the London bus map. He was a founding board member of Channel 4, a visiting professor of media at Oxford University and chair for more than 20 years of the theatre group Complicité, whose co-founder Annabel Arden said of him: “He was as maverick as we were, he was our rock”. His energies also extended to the environment, and he worked with Simon Jenkins on a programme that showed that Grade II listed buildings were being destroyed daily in what was meant to be Save Britain’s Heritage Year. “He was utterly bound up in his work and committed to the social purpose of the documentary,” said Jenkins. With Mike Dibb he made Is This the Way to Save a City? (1974) about plans to redevelop Cardiff. Dibb described him as “like a lawyer - so brilliant at summarising arguments”. Last year he was the first person to attend the exhibition at the Riverside Studios of the paintings of the American prisoner Donny Johnson, the subject of Dibb’s film Painted With My Hair. He had a lighthearted side and loved music and tennis, and supported Arsenal. Working with John Cleese, he directed three of the films of the Amnesty International benefits, including The Secret Policeman’s Ball (1979). This would happily reunite him with some of the stars of Beyond the Fringe. With Richard Curtis he co-produced the first Comic Relief (1985) and with James Rogan he made Monty Python: The Meaning of Live (2014). To the very end he was engaged in social justice, tweeting in late February “What a tragic ambition” in response to justice secretary Dominic Raab’s announcement of the creation of 4,000 new prison places in England and Wales and the news that the prison population would soon reach a record high of more than 100,000. He was also still busily engaged on projects right up to a few days before his death. With Rob Beckley, assistant commissioner at the Met police, he was working - “still bubbling with energy,” as Beckley put it - on a three-part radio series on the role of police in society, and with Netflix he had in mind a programme about Portugal’s decriminalisation of drugs. In 1971 he married Karen Bergemann, and they had a son, Max, and a daughter, Chloe. They divorced in 1983, and three years later he married Susan Richards, the author, Russian expert and co-founder of openDemocracy. She, his children and his brother, John, survive him.

3/4/2022,"A drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis could help to save the lives of patients with severe Covid, researchers have found, adding its benefits are seen even when it is used on top of other medications. Experts involved in the Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial say baricitinib, an anti-inflammatory drug taken as a tablet, can reduce the risk of death from severe Covid by about a fifth. However they add that when the impact of other medications used alongside the drug are also taken into account, the risk of death could be lowered by well over 50% – although the figure will vary from patient to patient. “What we have now is, a suite of drugs which tackle the immune system at different levels, and slightly different ways, which depending on the patient and their circumstances, and their other illnesses and so on, can be used either alone, or in combination, and further reduce the risk of death,” said Prof Sir Martin Landray, joint chief investigator of the trial at the University of Oxford, adding the drugs themselves do not appear to pose undue risks. Writing in a preprint that has yet to be peer-reviewed the team report how they looked at outcomes for 4,008 patients hospitalised with Covid between February and December 2021 who were given usual care – which included interventions such as oxygen, the steroid dexamethasone, the arthritis drug tocilizumab which has to be given intravenously, and the anti-viral drug remdesivir. These outcomes were compared with those for 4,148 patients who were given baricitinib for up to ten days in addition to usual care. The results reveal that while 546 patients given usual care died within 28 days of being admitted to hospital, the figure was 13% lower for those also given baricitinib, at 513 deaths. “This result was consistent across the very wide range of people we studied, younger people and older people, men and women,” said Landray. Landray also noted that those given bariacitinib were also more likely to be successfully discharged alive within the first 28 days, although the size of the effect was small, and less likely to require mechanical ventilation. The team add that when the new results were combined with data from other trials, all of which were smaller than the Recovery trial, they found baricitinib reduced the risk of death in patients hospitalised for Covid by around a fifth. The researchers say that neither the vaccination status of patients, nor the time at which patients took part in the trial – which may encompass different Covid variants – appeared to affect the results. While concerns have previously been raised from studies of long term users of baricitinib that the drug might increase the rate of infections or blood clots, the researchers say no signs of such side effects were found when it was used over a short period to help tackle severe Covid. Landray said a 10-day course of baricitinib would cost around £250, making the drug more expensive than dexamethasone, which costs about £5 for a course of treatment, but cheaper than tocilizumab which costs about £800-1,000, although he noted it is likely the prices paid by the NHS would be lower. While tocilizumab acts to block a protein that can cause an overreaction of the immune system, baricitinib blocks the transmission of signals from this and similar proteins. Prof Sir Peter Horby, also joint chief investigator of the RECOVERY trial added the results are also important given concerns that some Covid variants are resistant to certain antivirals. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, welcomed the latest results for baricitinib: “This is promising news from the government-funded RECOVERY trial and shows, once again, how the UK is leading the world in identifying life-saving treatments for NHS patients,” he said. “A big thank you to all of the researchers, doctors and volunteers involved in this work. Our medical and scientific experts will now consider the results before any decisions are made on next steps.”",News/World news,Arthritis drug could help save Covid patients – study,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/arthritis-drug-could-help-save-covid-patients-study
3/4/2022,"From a first fortune made from manufacturing plastic bags, which were in short supply in the Soviet Union, Alisher Usmanov’s business dealings saw him rise to become one of the 100 richest people in the world, buying multimillion pound mansions and stakes in English premier league football clubs along the way. Now the Uzbek-born billionaire risks losing some of the trappings of his extreme wealth after he was placed on the EU sanctions list, which named him as “one of Vladmir Putin’s favourite oligarchs”. The 68-year-old metals magnate was ranked 99 on Forbes magazine’s 2021 billionaires list with an estimated fortune of $14.1bn (£11bn). He is now facing asset freezes on anything he owns in Europe. Usmanov’s $600m superyacht Dilbar, which is named after his mother and thought to be the largest in the world by gross tonnage, was reported on Wednesday night as having been seized by German authorities from a Hamburg shipyard, according to Forbes magazine, citing three sources. Officials in the port city later denied the vessel had been confiscated. However, a spokesperson for Hamburg’s economic authority said there were no plans to return the boat to its owner. “No yacht is going to leave the port that is not allowed to do so,” they added. The EU has published an eye-catching list of reasons for blacklisting Usmanov. It claims he paid millions to an influential Putin adviser, “fronted for President Putin and solved his business problems”, and offered the use of his personal residences to one of the president’s most senior political allies. In a country where key business positions depend on the will of Putin, Usmanov is “entrusted with servicing financial flows”, the EU alleges. The EU also said Usmanov’s interests in media and internet companies had actively supported the Russian government’s attempts to destabilise Ukraine, including the curtailing of editorial independence after he took control of the Russian business newspaper Kommersant. Usmanov hit back, accusing the EU of “false and defamatory allegations” that were damaging his “honour, dignity and business reputation”. In the UK, Usmanov has not been facing sanctions and retains full control of his lavish property portfolio and other assets. But he has lost some of his influence in the world of sport. Everton football club moved on Wednesday to suspend all sponsorship deals with his USM Holdings company. These include a £12m-a-year sponsorship of the training ground, under a five-year arrangement that began in 2017. Usmanov does not have biological children, but his football interests became a family affair when his nephew Sarvar Ismailov briefly sat on Everton’s board and was the sporting and commercial director of its women’s team. Ismailov stepped down for personal reasons in November 2021, shortly before he appeared in court charged with grievous bodily harm. He was accused of assaulting a model as part of the same incident. The case was later dismissed owing to a “lack of evidence”. Sport has played a prominent role in Usmanov’s life. He was once a fencer, and met his future wife, Irina Viner, at a gym in Tashkent before she went on to become Russia’s top rhythmic gymnastics coach. Earlier in the week, the oligarch stepped down as president of the International Fencing Federation, a position he had held since 2008, saying he would suspend his duties “until justice is restored”. He added that he would use “all legal means” to protect his “honour and reputation”. Fencing was perhaps a fitting hobby for a businessman born in Soviet Uzbekistan who came to prominence and wealth through the cut-throat metals and mining industry. His colourful life even saw him spend six years in jail during the late Soviet era, after a conviction he claimed was politically motivated, and which was later overturned. In the years after the break-up of the Soviet Union, Usmanov was a director of several companies and financial firms. By the late 1990s, he was the general director of the state-owned energy company Gazprom’s investment arm, which he managed for more than a decade. Usmanov’s largest holding remains in the steel and mining company Metalloinvest, which he founded, and where he remains the main beneficiary, with a 49% stake owned through USM. His vast personal wealth has seen him buy the Grade-II listed Beechwood in north London for £48m in 2008 through Hanley Ltd, a company based in the Isle of Man. He has also been reported to own Sutton Place, a 72-room Tudor mansion near Guildford in Surrey, built in the 1520s by a courtier of Henry VIII and once owned by the US oil baron John Paul Getty. Usmanov’s spokesperson has disputed the information about his property ownership, but did not say whether he was still the beneficial owner of one or both of the properties.",News/Business,Alisher Usmanov: ex-fencer who ‘solves Putin’s business problems’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/03/alisher-usmanov-ex-fencer-who-solves-putin-business-problems-sanction-eu-oligarch
3/4/2022,"Clyde’s women’s team have dramatically quit the club after the men’s side re-signed David Goodwillie, as the backlash against the striker – found by a civil court in 2017 to have raped a woman – showed no sign of abating. North Lanarkshire Council – which owns the club’s stadium – threatened to end Clyde’s lease early if they allow Goodwillie into Broadwood and will not renew the lease when it expires next year, stating it had “a responsibility to the wider community to act, and to send a clear signal that abuse must not be tolerated”. The Scottish League One side Clyde confirmed the loan signing of Goodwillie from Raith Rovers until the end of the season on Monday. The announcement at the end of January that the Kirkcaldy club were signing the 32-year-old from Clyde prompted anger and disgust from supporters and a string of resignations of senior Raith officials. Val McDermid, the best-selling crime author and a devoted Raith fan, immediately withdrew her shirt sponsorship, denouncing the signing as “disgusting and despicable”. Now the entire playing squad of Clyde’s women’s team and the general manager David McGoldrick have followed the lead of Raith Rovers’ women’s team, who cut ties with the men’s club and renamed themselves McDermid Ladies after the novelist stepped in to pay for new strips, without the club crest. In a statement, the women’s team said: “As a group of female footballers all we wish to do is play the sport that we love but due to the current circumstances we are unable to do this.” Welcoming their announcement, McDermid told the Guardian: “I’m glad to see Clyde Ladies taking a principled stand and I wish them great good luck. The world has moved on over the last five years, and it’s clear that there is much less acceptance of violence against women and girls. They’ll find support in all sorts of quarters, and their decision will make it easier for others to follow suit”. North Lanarkshire Council confirmed it had written to the club on Thursday, in a strongly worded statement in which it “utterly condemns all and any violence towards, or abuse of, women”. “The council believes in rehabilitation, and has services which provide this. However, Mr Goodwillie has not expressed any contrition in relation to the rape which the court found he had committed in the civil action against him. In re-signing Mr Goodwillie, Clyde FC has not acknowledged that background or community concerns, instead choosing to focus on enabling Mr Goodwillie to play football”. It went on to note “some people have questioned why the council is only taking action now given that Mr Goodwillie has played for Clyde for a number of years” but clarified that the stadium had only recently reverted to direct council control. Goodwillie and his former Dundee United teammate David Robertson were sued for damages for rape by Denise Clair, who waived her right to anonymity, in a landmark case in 2017. The pair had not been prosecuted, but the civil court ruled they had raped Clair after meeting her on a night out in West Lothian in 2011. She was awarded £100,000 in damages. They denied the allegation and appealed against the judgment, but lost. Goodwillie was fined £250 for punching a man in a Stirling nightclub in 2008, and four years later pleaded guilty to assaulting a man in Glasgow city centre. Responding to the re-signing by Clyde, Rape Crisis Scotland said: “Footballers are role models; it is not OK to have someone in this position who has been found by a senior judge to be a rapist. This is a shameful decision that sends yet another clear message of disregard to survivors of rape and sexual violence.”",Sport/Football,Clyde women’s team quit club over signing of David Goodwillie,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/03/clyde-womens-team-quit-club-over-signing-of-david-goodwillie
3/4/2022,"A JetBlue pilot was removed from the cockpit of a flight and taken into custody in the US after having a blood-alcohol level more than four times the federal limit for pilots. The pilot, a 52-year-old man from Orlando, Florida, was first removed from the cockpit after a Transportation Security Administration agent told authorities Clifton looked “impaired” while passing through security, reported the Buffalo News. The pilot had told authorities that he had seven to eight drinks before he got on the plane that was departing from Buffalo Niagara international airport to Fort Lauderdale, said a Niagara Frontier TSA spokeswoman, Helen Tederous. After he was removed, police performed a breathalyzer test and found that his blood-alcohol level was 0.17%. The Federal Aviation Administration prohibits pilots from drinking within eight hours of a flight or flying with a blood-alcohol level more than 0.04. The pilot told police he needed to get his gun from the cockpit while being detained, according to reports. Pilots can carry firearms on planes if certified, but it was not immediately clear if he had the appropriate permits. He was initially taken into police custody, and was later released to JetBlue security. The pilot, who has since been removed from his duties by JetBlue, may face federal charges, said Tederous. In a statement, JetBlue officials said they were aware of the incident and cooperating with law enforcement. JetBlue also said they were conducting an internal investigation. “We adhere to all [Department of Transportation] rules and requirements concerning alcohol at all times and have a very strict zero-tolerance internal alcohol policy,” read the statement.",News/US news,Drunk pilot removed from cockpit of JetBlue flight to Florida,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/03/jetblue-pilot-drunk-flight-alcohol-florida
3/4/2022,"The owner of a children’s home in Bolton shut down for “serious and widespread failures” spent thousands intended for educating marginalised children on drinking, foreign trips and his pub business, the Guardian can reveal. Between 2015 and 2021, £1.5m was paid by two local authorities to a “community interest company” (CIC) run by Robert McGuinness, the main director of the children’s home. The CIC was set up to provide vocational training to children from years 9 to 11 (ages 14-16) excluded from mainstream schools. Profits from the CIC should, by law, have benefited the community. Instead, McGuinness, a Lamborghini-driving plasterer turned pub landlord, loaned his bar business £100,000 from the CIC. He also spent thousands from the CIC bank account on his own social life, as well as on foreign trips to Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Thailand, the Guardian has learned. The bar has since gone bankrupt and the liquidator says “there is currently no prospect” of the £100,000 loan being repaid. The case highlights why children’s social care experts believe there needs to be a “seismic change” to the entire system. Bank statements seen by the Guardian show that some nights McGuinness spent hundreds of pounds from the CIC’s account in bars and restaurants. More than £2,000 went on Airbnb stays in a single year and almost £5,000 was spent on pub furniture. A total of £182.78 was spent in a branch of Spar in Praia da Luz, Portugal, and just shy of £280 was spent across 2019 in an artisan bakery in Manchester. Achieve Care Homes Limited was set up in 2020 by McGuinness, 34, and his parents, Alison and Francis. In January, Ofsted inspectors suspended the licence of the children’s home run by the firm after finding that a boy had not bathed, changed his clothes or been provided with a home-cooked meal for four months. It was not the first time Ofsted had expressed serious concerns about a McGuinness-run establishment. In September 2020 he tried to open an independent school in Bolton called Stanley House, charging annual fees of between £22,000 and £40,000 for children expelled from mainstream education. It never opened, after inspectors found numerous problems including an electricity substation easily accessible to children and the lack of a playground. They also raised concerns that “leaders have not put systems in place to account for the income and expenditure for each pupil who will be funded by a local authority”. Yet McGuinness’s children’s home business was granted permission on Tuesday to turn eight flats in Bolton into apartments for care leavers aged 16 to 18. It was classed by the council planning committee as a “permitted development”, and did not need separate approval. This is despite the local authority’s head of children’s services having concerns about the company. Until the Guardian confronted him this week, McGuinness was a director of 11 firms, many using the “Achieve” brand. On Tuesday he resigned from Achieve Training Centre CIC, which still operates two “training centres” in Bury and Bolton in Greater Manchester for children excluded from mainstream education. One is at Stanley House, the site of McGuinness’s aborted school. The Guardian has seen evidence that the CIC’s bank account was regularly used to pay staff and contractors working on the renovation and running of the Printer’s Apprentice, a bar-restaurant in York city centre. It opened in February 2020, a month before the first lockdown, and went into liquidation in December 2020 owing £411,698. McGuinness used the CIC debit card to buy groceries, book hotels, eat out and withdraw cash while on journeys to Portugal, Belgium and Spain, and Krabi in Thailand. In 2019 the CIC bank account was used to spend more than £4,600 in pubs and restaurants and £2,264 on Airbnbs. Payments from the CIC account included £680 for a pub employee who successfully took McGuinness to an employment tribunal for £7,341 in unpaid wages in 2020, almost £5,000 for bar furniture, and £5,680 to LWC, a trade alcohol supplier. A legal adviser who helped with the employment tribunal received £5,000 from the CIC account. In addition, payments totalling £9,632 went from the CIC to “DMD pay”, which stood for Drink Me Dry pay. Drink Me Dry Limited was set up by McGuinness and his father in January 2018 to run the pub. Bolton and Bury councils were the CIC’s biggest clients until very recently. Between 2015 and 2021, Bury council, along with local schools and education providers, spent £904,537 sending young people from the local pupil referral unit (PRU) to Achieve Bury, which is situated on an industrial estate just outside the town centre. As a result of the Guardian’s investigation, a Bury council spokesperson said the local authority would not be placing any further children with Achieve. The PRU was “reviewing the current placements with the provider”, they added. Bolton council said it spent £654,340 sending 32 children to Achieve Bury from July 2017 to November 2019. Bolton’s director of children’s services, Bernie Brown, said she stopped using Achieve when it became apparent children were “not getting the formal education that had been commissioned, sitting down doing some maths and English and functional skills work”. Instead, the children were taken on “tours” of local employers, which did not help them reintegrate into a school setting, she said. “There’s got to be a seismic change and a seismic shift in the way that we approach this,” she added. One witness said the work experience involved labouring on building sites, including at the house in Bolton that McGuinness was in the process of turning into a small children’s home. Asked to explain all of these payments from the CIC account, a solicitor for the CIC insisted they were legitimate, saying: “Robert McGuinness and other members of staff have, on occasion, ‘salary-sacrificed’, such that our client directly incurred private costs of theirs, which costs were then deducted from their remuneration.” A report from the liquidator in February revealed that Drink Me Dry owed the CIC £100,000. It also owes £125,000 to McGuinness and £52,468 to AMG Properties Limited, which is run by his parents. The CIC lawyer said the CIC’s £100,000 loan came from “profits from its business”, despite the CIC annual accounts showing less than £8,000 profit in 2019 and less than £3,000 the year before, when Drink Me Dry was first established. It was “a normal commercial loan that is being repaid according to its terms”, the lawyer said. Yet the liquidator’s report says “there is currently no prospect of dividend to the unsecured creditors”, including the CIC. The CIC lawyer said the regulator investigated and considered the circumstances of the loan in 2021 and took no further action. Councils do not license or regulate children’s homes and do not have regulatory power to shut down providers. Neither of the Achieve Training Centres has ever been registered by Ofsted, which inspects individual buildings – children’s homes, schools etc – but not the operators. This means that companies can have numerous poor inspections and continue to operate and open new ventures. A representative for Achieve Care Homes Ltd and Robert, Alison and Francis McGuinness did not respond to a request for comment, but said: “We don’t know anything about this – you should ask Achieve CIC.”",News/UK news,Revealed: money for educating excluded children funded Bolton bar owner’s social life,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/03/excluded-children-funds-bolton-bar-owners-social-life
3/4/2022,"The human cost of the conflict in Ukraine continued to mount on Thursday, as devastating images emerged of a father grieving for his teenage son, while families paid tribute to a Ukrainian-American who they said dedicated his life to helping children. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) also confirmed the death of a member of its special Ukraine monitoring mission, who was killed while trying to get food for her family. Images by an Associated Press photographer of a father weeping over the body of his dead son came out of the city of Mariupol on Thursday, as the city came under unrelenting Russian bombardment. The man, named only as Serhii, was photographed holding the head of his son Iliya, in a maternity ward converted into a hospital in the Black Sea city. The OSCE said Maryna Fenina was killed on Tuesday during the shelling of Kharkiv and had died “while getting supplies for her family in a city that has become a war zone”. Dozens of families paid tribute to Serge Zevlever, a Ukrainian-American adoption facilitator who helped hundreds of children with special needs find adoptive parents in the US and other countries. An American dual citizen, Zevlever could have left Ukraine but chose to stay, and was shot and killed in Kyiv, two days after Russia launched an attack on his birth country, said friends. Jessica Aubert, 36, the CEO of the non-profit Yaqar Project based in Cleveland Tennessee, told the Guardian that she became aware of Zevlever’s death on 27 February. Through his agency Hand of Help in Adoption, which helps special needs children from Ukraine find adoptive families, Zevlever had helped hundreds of children, she said. Aubert, who adopted her son from Odessa in Ukraine in 2017 with Zevlever’s help, said he wanted “every child to feel a sense of belonging”. “He looks intimidating at first, but he’s just this incredible counsellor. Within five minutes, we could see that his whole heart and passion was in ensuring no child felt forgotten,” she said. Zevlever guided her and her husband through the adoption process, from meeting them the day that they arrived in Ukraine until the end of the process, she said.“He would always reiterate to us that ‘all that matters is that children find families’ […] His life’s work was being a force of good.” New Yorker Nathan Wolfe, who adopted two boys from Ukraine through Hand of Help in Adoption said: “Serge spent his life working to unite orphans with families. Two of our boys are alive and thriving today because of the work he did.” Nancy Cunningham Thornell co-founded Hand of Help in Adoption with Zevlever in 2014 after meeting him in 2010 when he and his wife helped her facilitate her own adoption in Kiev.“He was always working, 24/7,” she said. “I’d always tell families Serge is like a big teddy bear, he sounds like he is always yelling but he’s a big softie. His heart was always in it for these kids and that’s what I loved about working with him.” She added that the news of his death had been met with an outpouring of grief and love. “I have no idea what we are going to do now. Serge was a one-of-a-kind person who knew everything and would fight for these kids. It’s going to be really hard to fill his shoes because he was just amazing.”",News/World news,Father mourns son as civilian victims of Ukraine crisis continue to mount,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/father-mourns-son-as-civilian-victims-of-ukraine-crisis-continue-to-mount

Pretending to lever maintenance for children from absent fathers to give to mothers, it fails again and again. There is a deep political, cultural and legal bias that lets fathers get away with it. It’s the same women-are-to-blame instinct that tilts the benefit system against single mothers. Half of single parents and their children are consigned to life below the poverty line, a penury that 60% of them would escape if fathers paid the maintenance due. Figures from single parents’ charity Gingerbread show that 90% of single parents are women. From the National Audit Office today comes yet another report on the CMS’s abysmal performance. The audit office gets more complaints on this “than any other single issue”. Hardly surprising, when only a third of mothers receive full maintenance and just 56% have any maintenance arrangements in place at all. Vast arrears from absent parents grow. The audit office notes, with some dryness, that the Department for Work and Pensions “has reduced the legacy of debt relating to old Child Support Agency arrangements by £2.6bn”. Good news? Hardly. It was done “largely by writing it off”, and “unless it writes off more debt” arrears are now “forecast to reach £1bn by 2031”. Departments don’t usually predict future failure with such sanguinity. Large numbers of fathers have always sat on their hands. Through lack of will or instinctive empathy, the state fails to pursue them, though if they refused to pay tax, fixed-penalty notices or court fines, the police or bailiffs would surely come to the door. Debts to their children evade that strong arm of the law: call it unconscious bias if you like. Whatever you call it, we know that men command the culture that permits this behaviour. There is a continuum on which one finds financial control and coercion and then violence and even murder. A report out today from the End Violence Against Women coalition shows more women were killed by men last year, with 141 known cases. Strong male emotions about money – who has it, who controls it and who spends it – spill over from bad marriages into a weapon in bad divorces, with results of varying ferocity. Aggressive demonstrations by Fathers4Justice targeting the private homes of female politicians highlight the visceral outrage some men feel about being obliged to pay. The last time I wrote about this, someone posted my private address as that of the CMS, and occasionally I still get letters meant for the service, which I pass on. Luckily, I’ve had no visitors. But it should also be said that many fathers also have good reason to object to their treatment by the CMS, enduring the same incompetence and maladministration that drives mothers to despair. The NAO says many mothers, tired by incompetence and attrition, give up and walk away in frustration with no maintenance arrangement. To sign up for the collect and pay system, where the CMS promises to collect the money itself and pass it on, mothers have to pay fees amounting to 4% of any maintenance they get, and fathers pay 20% – money that could go to their children. But, despite this incentivised “reform”, the proportion of single mothers with no maintenance arrangement has risen from a quarter in 2011 to 44% now. The CMS has strong powers to deduct earnings at source from parents’ pay packets. It can confiscate driving licences and passports – but so what? Last year it removed just three passports and one driving licence. Some fathers are adept at reducing their apparent income, and their liability, by becoming “self-employed”. Look at this unlikely figure: 46% of paying parents using the CMS declare their earnings below the £12,570 tax threshold. Do so many really earn so little? The DWP tells the NAO that it has not estimated how many parents “misstate their income or circumstances”. Compare that with the DWP’s draconian pursuit of anyone slightly misstating their income for benefits. There, we see prosecutions at the drop of a hat and money clawed back, even it’s the DWP at fault. Gingerbread is inundated with CMS complaints from mothers such Mia (not her real name), whom I interviewed this week. She has three children under five, and when her partner left she tried to get the CMS to collect maintenance. That took 10 months, and then he only paid for three months. At one point the CMS sent the money to the wrong mother and then refused to pay it back, offering instead just £50 compensation. Her former partner knows all the tricks: he has changed his name, has several bank accounts and is now more than £7,000 in arrears. He declares just £12,000 in earnings, even though Mia knows he has a managerial job. “He’s a master manipulator,” she says. As for the CMS, she says it is part of the problem. She calls, hangs on for an hour and a half, starts to explain her case all over again, and very often the line goes dead. “It has me sobbing in sheer frustration. I just need someone to help,” she said. Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, notes acerbically: “Government has succeeded in its goal of reducing both its involvement in child maintenance and the cost to the taxpayer”, but that means “many separated parents are still left without maintenance payments.” The CMS costs the taxpayer 40% less than it did in 2011. Here’s how it did that: it made mothers needing help give up. Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,Fathers are condemning their children to poverty.
