3/29/2022,"The government could be forced to reveal private advice over the appointment of Evgeny Lebedev to the House of Lords, amid evidence the security services had concerns about the peerage. Labour will force a binding vote on releasing information about Boris Johnson’s involvement in the decision to award the peerage to the Evening Standard owner. Angela Rayner, the party’s deputy leader, will demand the information concerning the appointment from the Cabinet Office. The Guardian revealed in October 2020 that Johnson met Lebedev in March, shortly before the House of Lords appointments commission, which scrutinises all nominations, wrote to the prime minister. It is understood to have expressed concerns about Lebedev’s proposed peerage and asked Downing Street to reconsider. Peers were said to have had confidential briefing from the UK security services, which suggested the appointment was a potential security risk because of Lebedev’s father, Alexander Lebedev, a former KGB agent who worked undercover at the Soviet embassy in London. Downing Street is then alleged to have sought further assurances from the security agencies. They provided extra context, which was enough to lead to a different outcome, and peers signed off the appointment. Johnson has denied that he intervened to secure a peerage and Lebedev said in the aftermath of further reporting by the Sunday Times that he was not an “agent of Russia”. Johnson’s former chief adviser Dominic Cummings said he was in the room when Cabinet Office officials told Johnson that the intelligence services and other parts of the deep state had “serious reservations about the PM’s plan”. He said the prime minister stopped talking to him about the issue and “got a stooge to creep into the Cabinet Office labyrinth and cut a deal”. Rayner will use the humble address approach used by Labour during the Brexit years to force the release of key documents. She will ask Steve Barclay, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, to submit to parliament all the information about the appointment process. The government has previously told MPs to abstain on non-binding Labour motions – but the humble address technique has been legally binding in the past and may lead to the Tories whipping MPs to vote down the disclosure. “This is an important matter of national security,” Rayner said. “The prime minister has allowed his friendship with the son and business partner of an ex-KGB agent to blind his primary duty to the British public – to keep them safe. The prime minister has once again put personal interest before the public’s, and this time he’s risked national security. “The British public have a right to know if and how an individual of apparent concern to our intelligence services was granted a seat in the heart of our parliament by Boris Johnson, against security advice.” The motion will say there are “concerns raised about the appropriateness of, and process for, appointing Lord Lebedev as a member of the House of Lords and the role of the prime minister in that process”. It will request “any document held by the Cabinet Office or the prime minister’s office containing or relating to advice from, or provided to, the House of Lords Appointments Commission concerning the appointment of [Lebedev]”, including minutes, submissions and electronic communications, which could be texts or WhatsApp messages. The motion says redactions are permissible on grounds of national security.",News/Media,Evgeny Lebedev peerage: Labour seeks to force ministers to publish advice,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/28/evgeny-lebedev-peerage-labour-seeks-to-force-ministers-to-publish-advice
3/29/2022,"There is nothing obscure about the threat posed by Ivory Coast but their visit to Wembley still feels curiously like a break from routine. England have not faced an opponent from outside Europe since November 2018, when the USA were seen off in a friendly; this will be the first and last chance to give preparations for Qatar 2022 a cross-continental flavour. In the seven months leading up to the last World Cup England were able to face Brazil and then, once the draw was known, schedule friendlies in early June against Nigeria and Costa Rica. The theory is traditionally that it pays to test oneself against opposition who are proximate, geographically at least, to forthcoming group stage foes but that is far more difficult now. After Tuesday night, England will play Germany, Hungary and Italy twice each in the Nations League before travelling to Qatar, but will have no time for further experiments; those fixtures might be at least semi-competitive but none of them are likely to bear surprises. Then again, would any encounter do that? Gareth Southgate was asked whether it really matters that England will not be able to take on more unusual assignments between now and November, and whether the idea of distinct regional styles is outmoded given the level of cross-pollination and scrutiny throughout all corners of the sport. “I think a lot of European football is homogenised but I don’t think world football is yet,” he said. “There are tactical criteria that transfer across but there are definite attributes, traits and styles that do have cultural differences: South American football with the way it’s played, African football.” By that logic England may wish to avoid Saudi Arabia, Iran and Ecuador in November. Southgate believes the Covid-19 pandemic reduced his chances to experiment but also noted that globetrotting has not been on the agenda for most of their likely rivals. The key will lie in finding ways to mitigate any element of surprise. “In an ideal world we’d have exposed our players to more of that [variety],” he said. “We’ve always wanted to do it, at junior level as well. But we’ve missed that opportunity. When I talk to coaches from South America they’re regretting not having that opportunity as well. It’s been a factor in the last couple of years, with the difficulties we have all faced. It’s not what we would like but we’re in no worse a position than anyone else. It will be the teams that adapt best that succeed.” At the Africa Cup of Nations, Ivory Coast were sometimes attacking to the point of being gung-ho but were undone when they failed to break Egypt down, being picked off on penalties in the round of 16 and exiting at a stage that did not befit their threat. As it happens, spot-kicks are an issue to which Southgate can devote time more fruitfully than devising England’s schedule and, since they met up last week, improving their conversion rate has been a significant focus. Harry Kane’s winner against Switzerland came via a penalty, but the Euro 2020 final showed the pitfalls of having inexperienced takers to hand. Southgate said this month’s camp has seen increased concentration on “where we can improve to be world champions” and identified penalties as a factor. “In terms of regular penalty takers for their club, we really only have Harry Kane and James Ward-Prowse,” he said. “[Marcus] Rashford would have been the second-highest in number, but Bruno Fernandes is [Manchester United’s] normal penalty taker. “When we played Italy, their top five had taken more than 40 penalties in competitive matches. Kane is at that level and Marcus is next at 20. So we will have to view that differently than just accept ‘they’re going to get practice at their clubs and they will be able to come in.’ That is the challenge we have set with some individual work. We think it is the right thing to do.” He would go no further regarding the specifics of any penalty homework, suggesting many in-house matters are “intellectual property” and “there was too much that didn’t come from football departments that came out about things that happened in Russia”. The slightest change of plan, even the rejigging of a penalty order, can be costly he said. “There are some specifics of working, and the edge you’re looking to gain as a team, and we’d be foolish to give that to opponents or externally.” Given Kane may not start against Ivory Coast, the identity of any penalty taker against the Elephants may be instructive. So would the overall performance against Patrice Beaumelle’s side, who were only downed in added time by France on Friday after taking the lead through Nicolas Pépé. Mercurial at club level, Pépé tends to come alive for his country: factors like that are among the many that make international football less predictable than a glance down a squad list might seem. England are taking steps to reduce any reliance on chance. The match on Tuesday may come to look particularly useful once the draw has been made but, after that, much more may hinge on the work that takes place behind closed doors.",Sport/Football,Southgate regrets ‘missed opportunity’ before England host Ivory Coast,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/28/southgate-regrets-missed-opportunity-before-england-host-ivory-coast
3/29/2022,"The Scotland captain, Andy Robertson, has urged Fifa and Uefa to consider the wellbeing of players when deciding how many internationals can take place in June. A provisional plan exists for Scotland to play their delayed World Cup play-off semi-final against Ukraine in early June. That would be followed by a final against Wales just days later. With Scotland due to play four Nations League matches in the same month, there exists a potential scenario where they face half a dozen games during what traditionally would be time off. Robertson said: “From a football point of view, I don’t think it’s fair to ask players to play six games in June when our summer break is already being cut short because of the World Cup during the season. A lot has been said about player welfare over the last couple of years and I hope that’s at the front of it. “All the players are going to have to go through it and to ask players to have only two weeks off in a whole year is unacceptable. “I hope that the decision about the games in the summer is taken wisely. Whenever Ukraine can play the game then we have to play it, whether that’s September or October or whenever it has to be. It has to be on their terms and other games can make way for the most important ones.” Robertson, like everyone involved in the Scotland setup, stresses football is secondary to events in Ukraine. Yet, in a professional sense, the Liverpool full-back harbours clear concerns about the June workload. “It’s a lot after an intense season for everyone,” he said. “The games have to be played and four has to be the maximum. We are already going to the 14th, that’s not the start of June that’s well into June. “All the boys are back at the latest by the start of July. The Scottish [based] boys are back well before that, the Championship boys are back well before then. You are asking boys to have eight or nine days’ holiday, which I don’t think is fair. That’s why I hope it doesn’t go further than the 14th and that football and player welfare is at the forefront of the decision to be made around June.” Robertson will return from an enforced coronavirus absence to play in the friendly against Austria on Tuesday evening.",Sport/Football,Andy Robertson voices concerns over Scotland’s hectic summer schedule,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/28/andy-robertson-voices-concerns-over-scotlands-hectic-summer-schedule
3/29/2022,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s recent tour was in “sharp opposition to the needs and aspirations of the Caribbean people”, a human rights alliance from the region has said. The British monarchy’s historic role in the slave trade continues to damage the Caribbean’s society and economy, Jamaica’s Advocates Network said in an open letter published jointly with representatives from Belize and the Bahamas. Repeating the call for reparations to be paid by the UK government, the alliance said: “We stand united in rejecting this so-called charm offensive tour of the Caribbean undertaken by William and Catherine, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, which is in sharp opposition to the needs and aspirations of indigenous peoples and people of African descent in the Caribbean. “We stand united in condemning Britain’s savagery in enslaving our ancestors, the coarse indecency of colonial exploitation, the brutality of its enforcers and the enduring legacies of impoverishment and colonial-era ideologies that have damaged and continue to damage our people, our society and our economy.” It was a trip intended to repair relations between the monarchy and the Caribbean people, but Prince William and his wife faced fierce protests in Belize over a land dispute involving a charity of which the Duke is a patron. The opposition came as the Jamaican prime minister said his country would be “moving on” to become a republic, while a government committee in the Bahamas called on the royals to issue “a full and formal apology for their crimes against humanity”. William issued a statement after the trip – understood to have not been discussed with the Queen and Prince Charles first – in which he said the visit “had brought into even sharper focus questions about the past and the future”. But Cristina Coc, leader of the Maya community in southern Belize, criticised the duke and duchess for not going beyond saying sorry. “Before they ask us to heal, they must right the wrongs they have caused indigenous people and people of African heritage,” she said. “The powers and systems that continue to foster imperialism must acknowledge the harm done, not merely by an apology but by a true recognition of our inalienable human rights, land rights and true reparative justice. “We will not continue to remain silent in the face of continued threats to our identity, dignity and agency while privileged royals travel around in desperation to maintain the legacy of colonies.” Niambi Hall-Campbell, of the University of the Bahamas, lambasted the cost to taxpayers in the country to fund the royal tour. She said: “Why are we being made to pay again? Why are we footing the bills for the benefit of a regime whose rise to greatness was fuelled by the enslavement, colonisation and degradation of the people of this land, when we should be the ones receiving payments? “Several hundred thousand dollars in public resources and manpower were dedicated to accommodating the royal visit at a time when thousands of Bahamians are struggling to make ends meet amid high inflation.” The duke is understood to have also raised questions about whether it would be appropriate for him to be head of the Commonwealth, since the role is not hereditary. In 2018, Commonwealth leaders formally announced that Charles would become the next head after the Queen. Meanwhile, Sir Hilary Beckles, vice-chancellor of the University of the West Indies and chair of the Caricom Reparation Committee, said it was an “embarrassment” that the Queen continues as head of state to a number of Caribbean countries. He said: “It is now today, at this time to us, an embarrassment, that we should have a head of state who does not live among us, who does not understand the lives and the pain and suffering of the people who are her subjects, who cannot perform any role or functions among the people over who she presides and has to hire someone to do her work … because either she is too busy or unwilling, unable, cannot perform her duty as head of state and delegates that duty to someone else. “These are part of the embarrassments of colonialism that we can no longer take.”",News/UK news,"Royal tour ‘in sharp opposition’ to needs of Caribbean people, says human rights group",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/28/royal-tour-in-sharp-opposition-to-needs-of-caribbean-people-says-human-rights-group
3/29/2022,"In any documentary involving the British police there is always a moment where the disjunction between the form and content of what they are saying is so enormous it feels like you are suffering from a momentary dissociative episode. This reaches a possible apogee in Panorama’s Beyond Reasonable Doubt: Britain’s Rape Crisis (BBC One). Detective Brett Turner of the Derbyshire police force is interviewing a suspect who is denying all charges. “I know it’s hard to say: ‘Yeah, all right, I raped my two daughters’, it’s not nice to admit,” he says mildly. “But have a think about what you’re doing to your kids.” He encourages the father to “do the decent thing”. The father of Alex and Chyann – who allege that he abused them from such a young age and so often that they had no idea such misery was not a normal way of life – declines. The police start putting together the case against him. The young women – barely out of their teens – become part of a system in which the odds of finding justice are woefully, almost hopelessly, small. In essence, Panorama’s investigation is into the fact that rape has effectively been decriminalised, as Dame Vera Baird, the victims’ commissioner for England and Wales, put it in 2020, so small are the chances of a perpetrator being caught and punished. Beyond Reasonable Doubt opens with the recent finding that just 1% of reported rapes lead to a conviction, the lowest rate ever recorded, and at a time when such reports are increasing. Panorama does not mention a statistic that is surely almost as vital in understanding the scale of the problem, which is: it is estimated that only one in six rapes is reported at all. That puts the actual conviction rate at under a fifth of 1%. In addition to following Alex and Chyann’s case – which gets more appalling as it unfolds – the team traces three other reports, each emblematic of a different aspect of the current crisis. Fiona’s demonstrates the difficulty of proving intimate partner rape (most attackers are known to those they attack). Sam’s shows the obstacles presented by drunkenness, identifying an unseen assailant and gathering evidence from a public outdoor site. Adam’s is a case of historic sexual abuse by an uncle, so detectives have to go through 40 years of medical and other records, and track down people who might give corroborating evidence.. As ever with Panorama, it is a sober, industrious look at a complicated problem. But while it cannot be accused of sensationalism and probably does better than any other documentary strand would in balancing facts, figures and analysis against the emotionally compelling individual stories, you are left feeling that there is room for more. At times it’s as if news reports – eg, Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) changes five years ago that correspond to lower prosecution rates – are being illustrated, instead of research distilled and presented accessibly to as wide an audience as you might hope an hour-long programme could reach. A little more focus on what could be done to change things – given the increasing unwillingness of victims to report rape when they know a successful outcome is unlikely – would also be valuable. But the programme does the important work of highlighting the fact that the system is stuck in a destructive cycle, with the CPS second-guessing (potential) juries and declining cases they don’t think will result in a conviction; the police then second-guess the CPS and don’t forward cases they don’t think the CPS will think … And victims make a similar calculation in turn. All of this – plus many other contributory factors, like the years it can take to get a “strong” case to court after the pandemic’s effects on an already underfunded, tottering system, putting individuals’ recovery processes largely on hold – means that there are increasing thousands of people, overwhelmingly women, suffering at the hands of (even more overwhelmingly) men. The innocent are ballasted by grief, navigating the world with shattered souls. The guilty go free as birds.",Arts/Television & radio,Beyond Reasonable Doubt: Britain’s Rape Crisis review – a harrowing look at a broken system,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/28/beyond-reasonable-doubt-britains-crisis-review-a-harrowing-look-at-a-broken-system
3/29/2022,"Evacuation orders are in place for several northern NSW towns amid warnings of life-threatening flash floods, just four weeks after record floods forced thousands of people from their homes in the region. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe weather warning for heavy rainfall and damaging winds for a large region of eastern NSW, from near Port Macquarie north to the Queensland border. A region of Queensland is also covered by an alert after heavy rain dumped about 300mm over parts of the Gold Coast in less than a day. @NSWSES Evacuations begin in NSW Northern Rivers (again), with 236mm of rain at Coolangatta (Qld) since 0900 yesterday, Ballina 144mm, and rising. And a severe weather warning, with 6-hours totals of 300mm possible: https://t.co/E0A4G0fr0O @bom_au pic.twitter.com/zXhcYvxhVS “A low pressure system will drift southwards across northeastern NSW today, causing heavy rainfall in the region, and with locally intense falls within embedded thunderstorms,” the bureau warning said.“Heavy rainfall which may lead to flash flooding is forecast over the Northern Rivers District tonight, extending into the Mid North Coast and Northern Tablelands Districts from Tuesday morning,” it said. “Locally intense rainfall leading to dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding is possible with thunderstorms with six-hourly rainfall totals in excess of 200mm, possibly reaching up to 300mm,” it said. The NSW State Emergency Service issued evacuation orders for parts of Lismore on Monday night, while those living in low-lying parts of Billinudgel from 5am local time, on Tuesday. Residents of low lying parts of Mullumbimby and CBD were ordered to leave by 7am, with Tumbulgum later added to the evacuation list. We have issued ❗️EVACUATION WARNINGS❗️ for low lying parts of North Lismore and parts of South Lismore, to stay up to date with our current warnings visit👉https://t.co/t578A4vhe8 The SES has set up evacuation centres in about half a dozen centres, from Lismore to Kingscliff, Murwillumbah and Mullumbimby. For Lismore, the Wilsons River is again forecast to reach major flood levels, the bureau said. The river, which reached record levels of about 14.4 metres four weeks ago, may exceed the major flood level of 9.7m by 2pm Tuesday. It may exceed the 10.6m level of the town’s levee by the afternoon, with further rises possible. Tuesday is the main day for rain in NSW for this low, but showers linger for days (but in much smaller amounts) along the coast. @BOM_au pic.twitter.com/677TckdQ7R Elly Bird, a councillor in Lismore, told ABC’s RN Breakfast program, that the town had spent days clearing houses and city centre of flood-damaged debris, “questioning what’s next and is this going to happen to us again”. “Here we are 28 days later [our community] is just exhausted, worried and incredibly distressed about having to do this again so soon,” Bird said. Not many people had managed to move back to their “empty shells of houses” but some had, she said. The town is not expecting the river to reach the levels of the historic floods of earlier this month, Bird said, adding the emergency services including the Australian Defence Force personnel were in the area to help with preparations. Other rivers that could have major flooding include the Tweed, Bellinger and Orara rivers, the bureau said. In the Sydney region, Richmond collected more than 80mm of rain overnight, and there is a warning for minor to moderate flooding for the Hawkesbury-Nepean River that flows past the town. Observatory Hill, near Sydney’s CBD, had collected about 56mm in the 22 hours to 7am. The city could collect another 30mm-45mm on Tuesday, the bureau said.
