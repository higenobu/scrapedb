2/9/2022,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson late last year quietly shut down the only plant making usable batches of its COVID-19 vaccine, the New York Times reported, citing people familiar with the decision. The halt is temporary, with the Leiden plant expected to start making the vaccine again after a few months, the NYT report said. J&J currently has millions of doses of its COVID-19 vaccine in inventory and it continues to provide all its fill-and-finish sites, including Aspen, with drug substance required to produce its shot, the company said in an email. ""We continue to fulfill our contractual obligations in relation to the COVAX Facility and the African Union,"" J&J said. The facility, in the Dutch city of Leiden, has instead been making an experimental but potentially more profitable vaccine to protect against an unrelated virus, according to the report. The drugmaker last month forecast as much as $3.5 billion in sales of its COVID-19 vaccine in 2022, a 46% jump, having fared poorly compared to rivals. The company reported sales of $2.39 billion for the COVID shot in 2021, missing its own target of $2.5 billion, in a year marked by manufacturing stumbles, safety concerns and uneven demand for a vaccine once touted as a promising tool for inoculating populations in hard-to-reach areas. With the Leiden plant temporarily unavailable, it could reduce the supply of the J&J vaccine by a few hundred million doses, the NYT report said, citing one of the people familiar with the decision. Other facilities have been hired to manufacture the vaccine but they are either not up and running yet or have not received regulatory approval to make the shot, the report added.

2/9/2022,"A Sunday bike ride ended in tragedy in West Palm Beach on Sunday afternoon. According to a news release from the West Palm Beach Police Department, part of Royal Park Bridge downtown was shut down for about six hours after a bicyclist fell to her death. The unidentified woman was reportedly walking her bike across the movable span around 1 p.m. Police say she was only about 10 feet away from the end of the bridge when the drawbridge went up and she plunged through the gap. “The woman tried to hang on,” West Palm Beach police spokesman Mike Jachles told local station WPTV-Channel 5. Jachles said that a bystander on the other side of the barrier arms tried to grab her, but she tumbled to the concrete, about five to six stories below. An investigation has been launched to find out why the drawbridge was raised with a person on it as there are safety protocols to prevent against such an accident. The “ bridge tender has certain safety protocols to follow, specific safety protocols,” Jachles added. “That includes lowering of the gates for the vehicles, lowering of the gates for the pedestrians, and making several visual confirmations that there is nobody at either of the spans or past those gates.” Though the bridge is maintained by the state, the tenders are staffed privately. The tender was said to be “distraught” over the incident.",U.S./Miami Herald,"‘She tried to hang on.’ Bicyclist falls to her death from South Florida bridge, cops say",https://news.yahoo.com/she-tried-hold-bicyclist-falls-194903196.html
