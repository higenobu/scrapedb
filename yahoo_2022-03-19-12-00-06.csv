3/19/2022,"Here we go again with another incredibly racist school incident. A white high school student has been charged with a hate crime after someone caught a video of him whipping a Black student with his belt, reported The Associated Press. The student was also reported to have thrown cotton balls at him. Per video footage, the incident happened in the school cafeteria at Vandebilt Catholic High School in Houma March 9. The 15-year-old white freshman walked up behind the Black student and proceeded to throw cotton balls at him and whipped him with his belt. The Black student stood up and pushed him away.

Toasted: Jerk Chicken Empanadas and Mango Chili Sauce The teen was arrested Tuesday on hate crime and battery charges. From AP News: “I’m very pleased that the school took a front stand on this,” Terrebonne Parish Sheriff Tim Soignet said in a news release. “When we received the complaint, we immediately put our detectives on it. They worked through the weekend so we could get to this point,” Soignet said. “My officers did a good job handling it and working with the school to get this case to where it is now.” Vandebilt Catholic President Jeremy Gueldner said the school does not tolerate bullying or racism. These “actions by a few are not consistent with the values and mission of our school,” the archdiocese statement said. Well it’s a given that tolerating racism isn’t written in the fine print of a school’s mission. However, this is the third incident, nationally, in the past two weeks where a student has experienced a racially motivated attack. Terrebone Parish NAACP President Jerome Boykin acknowledged how quickly the school and sheriff responded and said he hopes the teen can “learn from his mistake,” per AP News. The family of the victim also responded in a statement. “We will continue to pray for our school community as a whole, that we not only get through this together but that we each learn a valuable lesson from what has taken place,” they said, per AP News.",U.S./The Root,Louisiana Student Charged with Hate Crime for Whipping Black Classmate,https://news.yahoo.com/louisiana-student-charged-hate-crime-162058932.html

3/19/2022,"It’s a startling message at first glance. But the note at the counter at Arthur Bryant’s Barbecue is unambiguous: “order anything besides brisket or burnt ends,” it reads in part. Those two cuts account for more than two-thirds of sales at the barbecue institution on Kansas City’s East Side. But increasing beef prices have the restaurant urging customers to try another protein like pork, chicken or turkey. Owner Jerry Rauschelbach says he hates the prices he’s forced to charge customers. What four months ago was a $10.95 brisket sandwich is now $17.95. (Keep in mind the whopping portions at Bryant’s: each sandwich is loaded with three-quarters of a pound of meat.) “I’m embarrassed by our brisket pricing,” he said. “But everybody’s doing it. It’s either that or you close your doors.” The cost of nearly all goods and services has been on the rise in recent months as the nation experiences the highest rate of inflation in 40 years. Rauschelbach says he’s seen the price of most supplies rise by at least 25%. But nothing has stung as badly as the skyrocketing prices of beef, which is generally a higher-priced protein. Longer gestation periods for cattle mean farmers can raise other meats like pork or poultry much quicker. Rising prices are so bad that Rauschelbach thinks consumers need to lay off the beef for a while to ease demand — a tall order this time of year when warmer temperatures will see many people firing up their grills and smokers at home. “We need to send the message that we’re not going to eat brisket, we’re not going to eat beef products,” he said. “And if you don’t eat beef products, prices will plummet immediately. It’s simply a supply and demand issue. “If everybody went to a barbecue place and ordered pork for a week, beef prices would come down real damn quick.” Like many other industries, restaurants have faced turbulent supply chains since the onset of the pandemic. Now, packing houses and other suppliers are facing significant labor shortages while product demand stays strong. The good news is that brisket prices seem to be easing. Ever so slowly. “Hopefully, we’ve seen the height and it’s starting to back off,” said Ryan Barrows, vice president of operations at Joe’s KC. “We’re easing off the recent highs. But we’re not playing the same game, yet alone in the same ballpark, as before the pandemic.” Joe’s has faced skyrocketing prices for many items, but soybean oil and beef have topped the charts. “There’s not one product that comes through our door that hasn’t risen in price in the last year and half,” Barrows said. Meat prices plummeted in the earliest months of the pandemic as restaurants closed their doors and cities implemented stay-at-home orders. But they began spiking in the summer of 2020. That saw wholesale brisket prices top $7 a pound, a staggering amount given how much volume a barbecue restaurant loses from meat shrinkage and trimming. Wholesalers are now selling brisket for $3.60 to $4 a pound locally. That’s still high, considering local restaurants saw brisket price of $2.45 per pound two years ago. “It’s been astronomically high for the last few months and it’s started to come off in the last couple weeks,” said Steve Ingala, director of operations at Mies Family Foods, which supplies meat and other products to local grocery stores and restaurants. While consumers can be price sensitive with many items, in Kansas City they don’t necessarily shy away from the meat when prices soar. “Surprisingly, demand stays fairly strong when that price goes up,” Ingala said. “It’s all driven by demand. People are hungry and as long as they’re buying it at the consumer level, it continues.” And now traditionally lower-priced meats are accelerating in price. Ingala said the per-pound price of fresh chicken breast is now only 30 or 40 cents below the per-pound price of whole briskets. “In a normal market, chicken would be a fraction of brisket,” he said. Already reaching record prices, the costs of eggs and chicken are expected to further spike now that several states have experienced outbreaks of avian flu at chicken farms. But none of this turbulence is new to those with experience in food businesses. “Even when things are normal, these proteins tend to fluctuate back and forth,” Ingala said. “When a couple are really high, one is usually more affordable. They kind of move around like that.”",Business/Kansas City Star,Famed Kansas City barbecue joint tells customers: Don’t buy the brisket or burnt ends,https://news.yahoo.com/famed-kansas-city-barbecue-joint-100000495.html
3/19/2022,"U.S. Army veteran Matthew Parker couldn’t stand seeing the images of Ukrainians fleeing homes that were being destroyed by Russian forces. But it was the plea from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for the formation of an “international legion” that gave Parker the final push to enter the fray. “It’s not easy on any human being to watch suffering. It’s really not easy for a soldier who’s been in combat to see it. Because we’ve seen it up close. You know it’s avoidable. The Russians are violating the law of war by doing what they’re doing,” Parker told Yahoo News. He cited the Russian invasion’s increasing brutality toward Ukraine’s civilian population, of which 3 million have already fled the war and countless others huddled in shelters amid artillery and missile barrages. “Every hospital that’s bombed, every baby that’s killed, every pregnant woman that’s killed, every orphan — that’s all our problem,” Parker said. Parker joined the U.S. Army in 1990, fighting in both Bosnia and Iraq, and retired at the end of 2011. He returned home to South Carolina and has dedicated his time to his security training business. Parker, who has four children, said he never envisioned returning to combat. But he said he views fighting for Ukraine as a continuation of his service — this time for democracy. “Every single one of us, when we joined, raised our right hand and said we would support and defend the Constitution of the United States. We accepted a role above us,” he said. “To me this is a continuation of what we signed on for, to support and defend. But in this case, it may not be the Constitution of the United States. This is more serving mankind, serving people. What [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is doing is wrong,” he said. As Parker prepares to leave for Ukraine on Thursday, he said his personal mission is to find the family of a Ukrainian soldier he knew who served alongside U.S. forces in Iraq. “I love that kid. I really do. He’s like one of my own kids. I wouldn’t tell him that,” he said. “I’m gonna go find them. I will find his mother, I’ll find his sister and daughter. If they’re still somewhere near Odesa, I will go find them. And if I can get them to safety, I will. If they’re safe, you know, I still want to check in on them and see how they’re doing,” he said.",World/Yahoo News,U.S. veteran volunteers to fight in Ukraine: 'A continuation of what we signed on for',https://news.yahoo.com/us-veteran-volunteers-to-fight-in-ukraine-a-continuation-of-what-we-signed-on-for-170111066.html
3/19/2022,"Before the bodies of his pregnant wife and two daughters were found in an oil field in 2018, Chris Watts denied any wrongdoing in a chilling text to his mistress, Nichol Kessinger. In a newly surfaced police video filmed during the investigation, Nichol detailed her affair with Chris and told officers that she questioned him about his family's disappearance when it made headlines. Per People, who verified the authenticity of the three-hour video, Nichol shared with authorities that she and Chris exchanged texts after Shanann Watts and her daughters, 4-year-old Bella and 3-year-old Celeste, went missing. ""I kept asking him, 'What did you do, Chris? What did you do?'"" she reportedly said in the video. ""I asked, 'Where's your family?'"" Explaining that she was ""stressed out"" at the time, Nichol recalled, ""So I texted Chris one last time, and I told him, 'If you did anything bad, you're going to ruin your life and you're going to ruin my life. I promise you that.' And he responded, 'I didn't hurt my family, Nicky.'"" Craziest True Crime TV Moments According to Nichol, that was ""the last text"" she received from Chris. She told investigators in the police video, ""I never said another word to him after that."" Susan Medina, a spokesperson for the Colorado Bureau of Investigations, confirmed the audio of the police interview was previously released. Shanann, who was 15-weeks pregnant, and her daughters were first reported missing from their Colorado home on Aug. 13, 2018. While Chris initially pleaded for their safe return on local news, he later confessed to killing them and hiding their bodies at his then-work site. He pleaded guilty to all three murders on Nov. 6, 2018, and was sentenced to five life terms in prison without the possibility of parole. In the police video, Nichol said that Chris told her he had separated from his wife and was planning on divorcing her. Still, Nichol told officers that Chris was ""never hostile"" when they would talk about his family. ""There were several discussions that we had about his current relationship and where it had gone,"" she said, according to People. ""It was never anything aggressive. It was still very kind.

3/19/2022,"By James Pearson LONDON (Reuters) - Britain and the United States have warned organisations of the risks associated with using satellite communications following a cyberattack on satellite internet modems as Russia invaded Ukraine. Western intelligence agencies have been investigating the attack which disrupted broadband satellite internet access provided by U.S. telecommunications firm Viasat, Reuters reported last week. ""It's certainly something we're investigating quite actively - more than quite actually,"" a British official told reporters on Friday. ""We've been talking extensively to UK organisations to give them a sense of how we can advise them on that point."" The unidentified hackers disabled tens of thousands of modems that communicate with Viasat Inc's KA-SAT satellite, which supplies internet to some customers in Europe, including in Ukraine. Late on Thursday, the U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a joint statement which warned of the ""possible threats to U.S. and international satellite communication (SATCOM) networks"" in the wake of the attack. SATCOM network providers and customers should increase their security and report any malicious activity given the ""current geopolitical situation"", the statement said. French government cybersecurity organisation ANSSI and Ukrainian intelligence are assessing whether the remote sabotage was the work of Russian-state backed hackers preparing the battlefield by attempting to sever communications, Reuters reported. Russian troops have taken heavy losses while blasting residential areas in Ukraine to rubble, sending more than 3 million refugees fleeing. Moscow denies it is targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special operation"" to disarm its neighbour. The digital blitz on the satellite service began on Feb. 24 between 5 a.m. and 9 a.m., the day Russian forces launched their invasion. ""Were it to be ultimately attributed to Russia, it would very much fit within what we expect them to do, which is use their cyber capabilities to support, ultimately, their military campaign,"" the British official said.

3/19/2022,"The House of Representatives passed a bill to halt normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus. Eight House Republicans voted against the bill on Thursday. Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz, Lauren Boebert, and Thomas Massie were among them. The House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday to suspend normal trade relations with both Russia and Belarus amid the war in Ukraine. The Suspending Normal Trade Relations With Russia and Belarus Act, which passed by a 424-8 margin, allows President Joe Biden to increase tariffs on products coming from the two countries and requires the US trade representative to seek suspension of Russia's participation in the World Trade Organization. The legislation must now pass the Senate and be signed by Biden to be enacted into law. This move came one day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's address to Congress, and a week after the House also voted to enact tougher sanctions on Russia and ban the importation of oil from the country. Seventeen members of Congress, overwhelmingly Republicans, voted against that measure. Belarus, though not the primary aggressor in the conflict, is a close ally of Moscow and has allowed its territory to be used by Russian troops for staging invasions. While Congress has been relatively unified in calling for Russia to be punished and for the US to support Ukraine, some on the right flank of the party have adopted a different tactic. Rep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina faced criticism from members of the GOP after he called Zelenskyy a thug at an event with constituents. Here are the eight Republicans who voted against the bill on Thursday: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona Rep. Dan Bishop of North Carolina Rep. Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin Rep. Chip Roy of Texas Most are on the right flank of the Republican Party and among the most loyal supporters of former President Donald Trump. Greene, for her part, bemoaned in a Thursday floor speech, ""All we're hearing on the news is Ukraine."" She added, ""Washington seems to care more about sending our sons and daughters to a potential war"" than more pressing domestic issues. Biden has repeatedly pledged not to send Americans troops to Ukraine. —Acyn (@Acyn) March 17, 2022 Massie told Insider in an email that ""this bill allows Biden and future Presidents to sanction virtually anyone they choose anywhere on the globe without Congressional approval,"" which he later tweeted about as well. —Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) March 17, 2022 Boebert told Insider in an email that Congress ""keeps focusing on distractions abroad and not our own challenges brought on by Joe Biden at home."" She said she believed the bill had ""bad language"" that could empower Biden to sanction people who ""simply hold traditional views of life and family and restrict access to abortion."" Roy told Insider via email that he would have supported the bill if targeting Russia and Belarus were the sole focus, but he took issue with the legislation because it would ""permanently empower the President with the unilateral authority to issue sanctions against anyone who he deems responsible for an undefined 'serious human rights abuse.'"" Biggs released a video statement echoing the concerns of the other Republicans, saying the bill would give Biden too much power and allow him to ""define what a human-rights abuse is."" —Rep Andy Biggs (@RepAndyBiggsAZ) March 17, 2022 Gaetz tweeted his support for Biggs' position, writing that he ""voted with Biggs for these reasons and others!""

3/19/2022,"Weam Brieche often posts videos about eating raw meat as part of his fitness routine. One video went viral, where he appears to eat raw brain and eggs for a ""high protein"" breakfast. Experts say eating raw meat can increase risk of disease, so it is safer to have cooked protein. A fitness influencer called Weam Brieche filmed himself appearing to eat raw beef brain and eggs in a viral TikTok posted on March 14 that has been viewed over 10 million times. In the video, Brieche said he was going to show his viewers ""how to eat a high protein breakfast if you don't have time to cook,"" before taking a bite out of what he said was a ""raw beef brain,"" and washing it down with a glass of ""six raw eggs."" He directed viewers to a discount code on his Instagram page, saying they could use it buy some brain for themselves from a free-range meat shop based in New York. Commenters under the video were shocked by the way Brieche appeared to enjoy the unconventional meal. One comment with 10,000 likes said the raw eggs weren't ""a big deal"" but Brieche was ""foul for eating a brain like it's banana bread."" Insider previously reported that eating eggs raw instead of cooking them increases the risk of salmonella and is also less nutritious, as the process of cooking an egg makes the proteins in it easier to absorb. Some commenters also expressed concern about the safety of the raw meat, with one writing ""enjoy the prions."" Prion disease can be caused by eating contaminated raw meat and lead to memory impairment, personality changes, and difficulties with movement. Influencers and celebrities have previously drawn attention for diets consisting of raw animal organs, often expressing a belief that by not cooking the meat, the body absorbs more of its natural nutrients. However, experts say that people should avoid eating raw meat because it increases the risk of contracting foodborne diseases. Bonnie Taub-Dix, a registered dietitian, previously told Insider, ""When you eat raw meat you run the risk of developing food poisoning,"" adding that some raw meat may also contain parasites like roundworms or tapeworms. Common pathogens in raw meat and organs include E. coli, salmonella, Campylobacter, and listeria, Taub-Dix said. According to medical news website Healthline, animal brain is a rich source of omega-3 and fatty acids, which can improve cardiovascular health. However, the outlet recommends avoiding beef brain as it could lead to increased risk of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), also known as ""mad cow disease."" According to John Hopkins Medicine, a human who eats the contaminated brain can develop dementia, muscle stiffness, and speaking difficulties. The FDA states that brain meat from high-risk cattle is prohibited from entering the US food supply to reduce the risk of BSE, which affects 300 Americans per year. In the description of his YouTube channel, Brieche wrote that he is not a doctor and said ""none of my videos should be taken as medical advice,"" adding, ""raw meat consumption could be dangerous if not well sourced."" Brieche has 100,000 followers on TikTok, where he updates viewers on his fitness journey, often eating meals that contain raw meat. He also has a YouTube channel with 1,000 subscribers, where he said he relies on ""animal fat for energy"" during workouts. On TikTok, Brieche continues to post videos where he eats unconventional food, such as one TikTok with 20,000 views where he bit into a chunk of meat he described as ""raw testicles,"" before unwrapping a stick of butter and eating it. In a video with 800,000 views, he also showed viewers his freezer, which appeared to be filled with bags of raw meat, including ""steaks,"" ""bone marrow,"" and ""liver,"" he said.

3/19/2022,"LONDON — Anyone looking for signs that embattled and isolated Russia might soften its position would not have found much hope in the increasingly belligerent words of President Vladimir Putin. With his invasion of Ukraine floundering and his economy teetering, Putin doubled down Wednesday, turning his baleful glare on Russians who are against the invasion or who sympathize with the West. ""The Russian people will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors and will simply spit them out like an insect in their mouth onto the pavement,"" he said, shoulders hunched and staring down the barrel of the camera. It was the latest speech to surprise and alarm many who study Putin. He has adopted what they say is an emotional, ranting tone since Russia invaded Ukraine three weeks ago, a departure from the calculating persona of a former KGB officer. ""He's clearly angry, emotional and feels the need to speak in this very aggressive tone,"" said John Lough, an associate fellow at London’s Chatham House think tank. Lough said the speech was clearly aimed at Russia's elites, some of whom he believes are privately dismayed about the failure of the war and the economic backlash it has inflicted at home. According to Lough, Putin was saying to the elites: ""Don't think about having second thoughts. We're all in this together, and if I go down, you go down."" Putin touched on now-common themes, comparing the West to Nazi Germany and alleging, against all evidence, that Ukraine has been committing genocide against ethnic Russians. But he adopted even more hard-line rhetoric when he turned his attention to Russians themselves, whom he has subjected to a sweeping crackdown on anti-war dissent in recent weeks. Almost 15,000 protesters have been arrested in Russia since the war began, according to OVD-Info, a human rights group based in Moscow that tracks police detentions. Unknown thousands more have fled the country, driven away by a deepening state repression of protest, independent journalism and social media, as well as a plummeting economy hit by international sanctions and mass boycotts. The Kremlin said Thursday that it was those people who were showing themselves to be “traitors.” “They vanish from our lives,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to Reuters. ""Some people are leaving their posts. Some are leaving their active work life. Some leave the country and move to other countries. That is how this cleansing happens. “In such difficult times,"" he added, ""many people show their true colors."" Putin’s tone contrasted with those of the Russian and the Ukrainian negotiating teams, which signaled tentative progress in peace talks. Some experts saw his speech as a chilling sign. “Putin in an Orwellian way has divided the citizens of Russia into clean and unclean,” Andrei Kolesnikov, a Moscow-based political analyst, said on Twitter. Constanze Stelzenmüller, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, compared Putin’s speech to Adolf Hitler’s fictional tirade from the bunker in the 2004 film “Downfall,” whose subtitles have generated countless memes. “Strrronngg ‘Der Untergang’ vibes here,” she tweeted, using the film’s German title. Putin reserved special ire for Russian oligarchs, many of whom are Kremlin-linked billionaires who made their fortunes in the carve-up of the former Soviet Union and now spend much of it on yachts and other luxuries in the West. Some of them have recently broken cover and distanced themselves from Putin's war. Without naming anyone specifically, Putin referred to ""national traitors"" who ""have villas in Miami or the French Riviera, who cannot make do without foie gras, oysters or gender freedom, as they call it"" — referring to his apparent disdain for liberal values. He criticized their ""servile mentality"" of being too Western ""in their minds, and not here with our people and with Russia."" Putin also called for “a natural and necessary self-detoxification of society,” which would “strengthen our country, our solidarity and cohesion.” Much of the rest of Putin’s speech detailed the drastic economic countermeasures his government is introducing to combat sanctions and boycotts by Western governments and companies. “Indeed, it is difficult for us at the moment,” he acknowledged. Lough, who was the first NATO official posted to Moscow in the 1990s, said his contacts there are privately conveying “surprise, shock and disbelief that Russia"" is engaged in the war. There is now an “acceptance that this is going to usher in a period of extreme isolation of Russia, as well as impoverishment and a return, frankly, to many of the features of the Soviet Union,” he said.",World/NBC News,'He's clearly angry': People who study Putin are alarmed by his latest speech,https://news.yahoo.com/hes-clearly-angry-people-study-170044459.html
