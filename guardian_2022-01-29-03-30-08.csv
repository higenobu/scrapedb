1/29/2022,"“Dad came to Derby in 60s from India. Going to games probably made him feel less alien as all supported the same cause. We as a family done the same since ’92. City and club part of identity.” So reads one of hundreds of tweets on an emotional thread devoted to Derby County football club, which risks expulsion from the English game if financial guarantees are not forthcoming by the end of February. A proud city is holding its breath and hoping for the best. But it should never have come to this. Primary responsibility for Derby’s predicament must lie with its former owner, the local businessman Mel Morris. Betting this famous club’s future on its ability to regain a place among the Premier League’s wealthy elite, Mr Morris was found to have flouted the financial fair play rules of the English Football League (EFL), thus driving the club into unsustainable debt. When promotion didn’t happen, the game was up. Mr Morris took the club into administration and the EFL imposed a 21-point deduction for financial breaches. Unless a new owner materialises to assuage creditors – and damages claims from two rival clubs are dealt with – Derby risk imminent liquidation and the league will lose a founder member.  Three potential buyers are circling. This week the EFL extended a deadline for a solution to be found by one month. But this sad episode has again underlined the need for football clubs to be protected from the egos, ambitions and dubious schemes of owners. An independent regulator – as envisaged by the recent fan-led Crouch review of football governance – would act as a bulwark against malpractice and a crucial ally for fans concerned that their clubs have fallen into the wrong hands. Derby’s near-death experience also lays bare the knock-on consequences of allowing too much power and wealth to be hoarded in football’s top tier. Owners such as Mr Morris win backing for the risks they take because they seem to offer a route to the promised land. The Crouch review noted disapprovingly the “huge disparities between the finances of the Premier League and the rest of the football pyramid”. The game needs to return to the more egalitarian ethos that prevailed before the Premier League breakaway in 1992, when revenue was more evenly distributed. The riches amassed at the very top are disproportionate and have generated a self-perpetuating elite, gradually stripping the game of romance and its capacity to surprise. Football is not just another industry. Discussing the situation at Derby, the footballer-turned-pundit Gary Neville suggested that clubs should be treated like “Grade I-listed buildings” rather than ordinary businesses. As communal institutions that instil a sense of belonging and foster civic pride, the way they are governed matters. At this weekend’s home game against Birmingham City, Derby’s Pride Park stadium (currently owned by Mr Morris) will be packed in a show of support. The rest of the football world is united in hoping they get out of the woods, but lessons must be learned from this hair-raising rollercoaster ride. The government appears favourably disposed to the recommendations of the Crouch review. It must now act on them.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on football governance: there must be no more Derbys | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/28/the-guardian-view-on-football-governance-there-must-be-no-more-derbys
1/29/2022,"The Met Office has said there could be power cuts and travel chaos as Storm Malik brushes past the UK over the weekend. Gusts are predicted to reach 80mph in coastal areas as the storm, named by Denmark, hits parts of Scotland and northern England.  Yellow weather warnings are in place between 4am on Saturday and 12pm on Monday, and alerts issued for possible injuries and danger to life caused by flying debris. The Met Office’s chief meteorologist, Paul Gunderson, said: “The impacts of Storm Malik are going to be the greatest in Denmark on Sunday, but the track of the storm in the preceding hours means that the UK will be dealt a glancing blow as Malik moves eastwards on Saturday. “For those in the north of the UK there will be high winds and rain on Saturday, with showers possibly turning wintry on the high ground of the north. “The highest winds are expected in exposed coastal areas in the north and east of Scotland, but it will be a windy day for most.” Malik is expected to bring winds of 60mph more widely as it tracks eastward towards Denmark. Blustery winds and light rain are forecast for the south. The BBC weather presenter Tomasz Schafernaker said eastern Scotland, including Edinburgh, Perth and Aberdeen, was expected to be worst affected. “By Saturday evening things will be dying down but there’s another storm hot on its heels on Sunday with a very similar level of intensity,” he said.",News/UK news,Storm Malik: Met Office says power cuts and travel chaos possible,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/28/storm-malik-met-office-says-power-cuts-and-travel-chaos-possible
1/29/2022,"My friend Lorry Leader, who has died from lung cancer aged 67, was an administrator at the Guardian for nearly 20 years. She was a much-loved colleague and sympathetic ally to countless reporters and editors. She was born Sarah Loretta Leader in St Pancras, north London, to Samuel Leader, a teacher, who had arrived in the UK in 1913 from Poland, and his wife, Bertha (nee Schwarz), who came to Britain from Vienna after the Anschluss in 1938.  Lorry, as she was known, grew up in Stamford Hill, Hackney, and went to school at JFS, a Jewish mixed comprehensive. After finishing her A-levels in 1972, she became a Braille corrector in the book production department of the National Library for the Blind. Four years later she became an adventure playworker in Notting Hill and then Peckham before in 1979 enrolling as a student nurse at University College Hospital. After a year, she changed to the humanities and went on to achieve a first in English literature from Middlesex Polytechnic (now Middlesex University). In 1984 Lorry became assistant to the director/editor at the Writers and Scholars Educational Trust and Index on Censorship, campaigning organisations for freedom of expression, where she stayed for 10 years. In this role she patiently mentored volunteers who compiled the important “Index Index” section of Index on Censorship – a country-by-country factual listing of abuses of freedom of expression that was put together each issue. Her colleague Philip Spender remembers her as “laughing, intelligent, efficient, and thorough – a stout defender of her opinions – she knew why she held them and was happy to argue her case lightly but firmly.” In 1993 she met Giorgio Giandomenici, who would become her partner for the next 28 years. They married in 2011. Their shared love of travelling took them to Paris, to his native Venice and beyond. She particularly loved the forest of columns in the mosque in Cordoba, the synagogue of El Tránsito in Toledo and the Blue mosque in Istanbul. Lorry joined the Guardian newsdesk as an administrator in 1996 and, as the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, said: “Lorry supported countless news editors, was a confidant and friend to reporters and specialists. Lorry’s unflappable and generous nature were essential to the newsroom through many testing times.” Lorry was a staunch, but critical, Labour supporter. She also loved the theatre, books, art and music. After leaving the Guardian in 2016, she took a variety of online courses, including one about Shakespeare, a passion of hers – she knew most of Macbeth and Hamlet by heart. She also had an old piano tuned and had started to revive her playing skills. A few days before her death she sang a word-perfect rendition of Tonight from West Side Story. Lorry was devoted to her many friends: kind, thoughtful, funny and passionate about helping others. She is survived by her husband and a nephew.",News/Media,Lorry Leader obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/28/lorry-leader-obituary
1/29/2022,"The parents of an eight-week-old baby girl who died with more than 60 broken bones in her body have been jailed after being found guilty by a jury of causing or allowing her to suffer serious physical harm. During their police interviews, Naomi Johnson, 24, and Benjamin O’Shea, 26, claimed paramedics caused the injuries suffered by their daughter Amina-Faye Johnson, who had 41 fractures to her ribs and 24 fractures to her limbs when she died in April 2019.  O’Shea, a former army reservist of Southwark, south-east London, was jailed for eight and a half years, while Johnson, of Battersea, southwest London, was jailed for seven years. Judge Nigel Peters QC, sentencing at Inner London crown court, said that “sadly” this is “yet another harrowing case of parents abusing or being cruel to their child”. He added: “There is no doubt that this is a case of the highest seriousness in terms of cruelty to children in terms of the injuries.” The couple had called 999 after their daughter stopped breathing. Paramedics arrived within minutes but she died at the scene. The court heard that the Metropolitan police said there were no visible signs of injuries and Amina-Faye was initially thought to have suffered a sudden unexplained death, but X-rays later identified her broken bones. Radiologists said the fractures were highly indicative she had suffered physical abuse, although no exact cause of death was established. The couple suggested their daughter’s death could have been the result of inoculations she had received when they took her to the GP the day before her death, and that the rib fractures were caused by paramedics performing CPR. Amina-Faye suffered “deliberate, vicious injuries”, with the worst to her right thigh bone which could “only have been caused by a brutal attack”, the court was told. It was “remarkable” there were no signs externally of her fractures, the judge said. Both parents shared equal blame as it was “inconceivable” they would not have noticed her suffering. A medical expert concluded the baby’s limb bone fractures had been caused over at least seven occasions, while her rib fractures had been sustained in at least two incidents. The relationship between Johnson and O’Shea, who met when she was 15 and he was 18 or 19, and who have now split up, was described by the judge as “fractious” and “tempestuous”. It was clear in court that there was still a “temper between the two of them”, the judge said. He said O’Shea spun a web of lies about his background, work and career to suggest he was suffering after serving in Afghanistan, though it “was all completely untrue”. Detectives found a call Johnson had made to NHS 111 on 1 April 2019 reporting that Amina-Faye had been coughing blood. When the doctor phoned back and spoke to O’Shea advising him to take her to hospital, she was not taken. The two were also each given two months, to be served consecutively, after being found guilty of cruelty to a person under-16 in relation to a separate child. Amina-Faye’s case was described as “truly heartbreaking” by D I Melanie Pressley, who led the investigation. She said: “In eight weeks of life, Amina suffered an unimaginable number of injuries. The trauma she endured in her short life is impossible to comprehend. Her injuries are a catalogue of the most despicable abuse.”",News/UK news,Amina-Faye Johnson: parents of baby who died with 60 broken bones jailed,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/28/amina-faye-johnson-parents-of-baby-who-died-with-60-broken-bones-jailed
1/29/2022,"Covid-free for almost two years, some Pacific island nations are suddenly struggling with an explosion in cases as the virus, thought in most cases to be the more transmissible variant Omicron, breaches the defences they had so successfully put up since the beginning of the pandemic. Kiribati, Samoa, Palau and Solomon Islands have all experienced outbreaks within the last three weeks. The countries have approached the arrival of the virus with different strategies, some imposing lockdowns while others rely on their high levels of vaccination for protection.  Given their remoteness and the fragility of health systems there are nevertheless concerns about how they will cope, with many locals fearful. Covid arrived in Kiribati two weeks ago, when two-thirds of the 54 passengers on a plane from Fiji, the first international flight to arrive in ten months, were diagnosed with the virus on arrival. Since then the situation has spiralled. The island nation now has a total of 201 cases as of Friday, and the virus has spread from the capital, Tarawa, to Butaritari, an outer island located 186km to the north. The government has imposed a full lockdown, extended on Thursday for another week, with people only allowed to leave their homes for essential services. The Butaritari cases arrived on a ship from Tarawa, but were not tested until they had already spent several days in the community. South Tarawa businessman Kitina Etau, who comes from Butaritari, is worried about his 70-year-old father who remains on the island. “I was taken by surprise that passengers were allowed to travel on the ship despite the lockdown measures enforced on Saturday,” Etau said. With limited communication on the island, Etau is yet to hear from his father and is worried that though the infected passengers are now in quarantine he may have been in contact with them as his father had been expecting cargo on the ship. As cases escalate, people fear the virus has spread across the islands faster than testing can keep up. Dr. Tabutoa Eria, a doctor who works both on the frontlines and for the government, wrote on Facebook that medical teams would no longer be dispatched to conduct community testing, appearing to suggest that critical resources were running low. “We are reserving our testing kits and other resources for patients who have underlying conditions because they will be hit hardest from the virus,” said Eria. The first case of community transmission in Palau was reported on 10 January – by Thursday, just over two weeks later, the Ministry of Health had reported almost 800 cases in the country of just 18,000. Despite the exponential increase and a plea from traditional chiefs last week, the government has ruled out a lockdown or a closure of the border, putting its faith in the country’s high vaccination rate of 96% of the eligible population (those aged five and over) and evidence that Omicron is less likely to lead to hospitalisation. Instead it has closed schools and encouraged mask-wearing and social-distancing. One woman, a mother of four, said that it felt like the government was doing less just as cases were starting to increase.“Since the inevitable arrival of Covid to our tiny island nation, I feel we are left to fend for ourselves with little to no help from the government,” she said. It is not clear how the virus entered the community. In a press release on 5 January, the Ministry of Health said only that three positive cases had been identified on 31 December and has not responded to requests for more information citing privacy reasons. Senator Stevenson Kuartei, who is also a doctor, said the Covid surge was putting additional stress on Palau’s already “thin” health sector, especially as doctors and nurses were “removed” from duty due to Covid.The Ministry of Health ministry is also running out of isolation spaces. Health minister Gaafar Uherbelau said he expected a steep increase in cases in the coming weeks, “given how highly transmissible the Omicron variant is, which is what we suspect is in Palau now.” “We are currently monitoring cases and should there be a surge with those needing to be admitted that would overwhelm the hospital capacity, then we’ll look to implement more community mitigation strategies,” he added. The first case of community transmission in Solomon Islands was reported on 19 January; 12 hours later the country had recorded more than 100 cases and within two days 50 nurses at the National Referral hospital, the country’s largest, had tested positive. “We now need to work together to ensure we get this under control,” prime minister Mannaseh Sogavare said in a nationwide address. The country is enduring its first lockdown, and reported its first two Covid deaths earlier this week as cases rocketed to almost 700. But with only 59 beds in the national isolation centre in Honiara and the outbreak at its underfunded main hospital, there are fears about the health system’s ability to cope. Its vaccination rate is also low – in a population of about 700,000, just 264,085 vaccine doses had been administered as of 13 January. “Our people are not ready to handle such a outbreak,” said taxi driver Walter Kito, who added that his business had also suffered and he had no money to support his family. “I appeal to those who have not vaccinated to please do so now.” In a country that lost more than 20% of its population in the 1918 influenza pandemic and more recently lost 83 babies and children in a measles epidemic three years ago, the arrival of Covid-19 has caused panic. The numbers have grown steadily since 10 passengers tested positive after arriving in Samoa on a flight from Australia on 19 January. Another 12 passengers and five nurses who cared for them have since tested positive, bringing the total number of cases to 27 as of Thursday. A lack of clear communication from the government on the cases sowed confusion that was compounded when it did not declare a level 3 alert, which is supposed to be triggered by 10 cases or more. However, once cases reached 15 on Saturday, the prime minister, Fiame Naomi Mata’afa, declared a 48-hour lockdown which has since been extended. The lockdown includes complete border closures as well as the shutting down of inter-island travel, and internal transportation. In an unprecedented move, Samoa also mandated quarantine for 250 frontline workers who had dealt with the infected passengers and are now camped out in the national hospital at Motootua for 21 days. “This decision is made for the country and their respective family’s interest,” said Leausa Take Naseri, the director general of health. He also called on quarantine hotel management and staff to self-isolate at their place of employment. “We must contain any transmission of the virus inside quarantine for the country’s sake.”",News/World news,"Fear and dread: Covid-free for two years, Pacific islands experience explosion in case numbers",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/29/fear-and-dread-covid-free-for-two-years-pacific-islands-experience-explosion-in-case-numbers
1/29/2022,"It would be hard to imagine a more dramatic way to illustrate the need for investment in US infrastructure that Joe Biden was set to talk about in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Friday. Hours before his visit and just four miles from where the president was scheduled to speak, one of Pittsburgh’s major car bridges collapsed.  At about 7am, the 477ft-long bridge on Forbes Avenue caved in, leaving a mass of concrete rubble and twisted metal as a visual metaphor for America’s crumbling infrastructure. At least 10 people were injured, three of whom were taken to hospital, and a bus and several cars left stranded in the wreckage. Rescue crews had to rappel 150ft down the hillside in order to reach injured people, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “If this would have occurred an hour later, this is a road that gets probably about 15,000 cars on it a day, and if it was rush hour, we would be looking at a couple hundred cars down in that valley,” said Corey O’Connor, a Pittsburgh city council member. “We got very, very lucky today, and hopefully those individuals at the hospital recover quickly and they’re home safe in the next couple days.” “The president is grateful to the first responders who rushed to assist the drivers who were on the bridge at the time,” the White House said in a statement. Mike Doyle, the Democratic Congress member for the Pittsburgh area, said the bridge collapse was a “tragic example of why the infrastructure bill Congress just enacted is needed. We should be constantly investing more in our infrastructure so our bridges and other public works don’t reach this point of disrepair.” The timing of the disaster was uncanny. Biden was visiting Pittsburgh to promote his $1.2tn infrastructure package which he signed into law in November after it passed through Congress with exceptionally rare bipartisan support. The bill is designed to inject vastly needed resources into the repair of the country’s key infrastructure including roads, railways, drinking water and bridges. Under the scheme, Pennsylvania is earmarked for $1.63bn of federal funds specifically for bridge improvements. The Forbes Avenue bridge itself told a story. The structure was built in 1972, putting its age – 52 – years above the national average of 44 years for US bridges. A recent report from city inspectors found that both its deck and superstructure underneath the road were in poor condition. That story is one that is repeated across the country. Years of inadequate public investment have allowed critical constructions and networks to age and deteriorate. Six people were killed in a catastrophic bridge collapse in Miami, Florida, in 2018. Last year the American Society of Civil Engineers surveyed the landscape of US infrastructure and gave it a C-minus. The report noted that of the country’s 617,000 bridges, 42% were at least 50 years old and more than 46,000, or 7.5%, structurally deficient and in a poor state. By the society’s reckoning, the US needs not only an emergency injection of funds to rehabilitate its bridges, but a regular increase of investment from the current $14bn to $23bn annually. Again, Pennsylvania tells the tale. The state is fourth in the national league table for the proportion of its structurally deficient bridges. It has 15% of its bridges in poor condition, after Rhode Island (22%), Iowa (19%) and South Dakota (17%). Pittsburgh politicians made the connection between the Forbes Avenue bridge collapse and Biden’s visit. The city’s mayor, Ed Gainey, said they were fortunate to have had no deaths and added: “We know we have bridges we need to take care of.” With Biden visiting on the same day as the disaster “to talk about this infrastructure bill and why this funding is so important, today is significant”, Gainey said. The infrastructure bill was one of the rare instances in recent times, and during Biden’s presidency, when a modicum of accord has been reached between the two main parties. The package passed the House of Representatives in November by 228 to 206 votes, with 13 Republicans backing it. Soon after the Senate gave its blessing with 69 votes to 30, clearing the 60-vote filibuster that has so often strangled Biden’s initiatives.",News/US news,Pittsburgh bridge collapses hours before Biden’s infrastructure speech in city,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/28/pittsburgh-bridge-collapse-biden-infrastructure-speech
1/29/2022,"Martin Kettle explores the history of the ban on discussions about the royal family in parliament and advances reasons why this is no longer legitimate in the modern relationship between the monarch and parliament (Why is parliament still banning itself from talking about the monarchy?, 25 January). He does not refer, however, to the most important reason why this ban should be removed. It is that, in constitutional law, the legislative process culminates in the royal assent given to a parliamentary bill that transforms it into an act of parliament. Over the past year the Guardian has revealed a hidden stage in the legislative process whereby some bills, prior to their submission to parliament, are sent to the monarch for their “consent”.  It would seem clear that the ban should be lifted so that MPs be allowed to debate the reasons why it is deemed necessary for a bill to be sent for the monarch’s consent in the first place.Gerald CrawleySt Briavels, Gloucestershire  Britain really is Ruritania. As Martin Kettle explains, our “constitutional monarchy” is quite bizarre. Our state institutions are warped by our absurd and antiquated unwritten constitution. Our prime ministers wield electoral dictatorship powers, never mind how small their majority in parliament. Part of this is because of the “royal prerogative”. Our House of Lords is an offence to all who believe in democracy. All of us are “subjects” of the monarch rather than equal citizens. We are a neo-feudal society, burdened by a caste-like class system which maintains and reproduces a social hierarchy with the monarch at the top.Philip WoodKidlington, Oxfordshire  Martin Kettle writes that “no minister answers to parliament for the royal family”. This is not quite correct. It is the duty of Stephen Barclay, as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and a member of the cabinet, to be “responsible to the sovereign for the administration of the duchy”. What is the duchy? According to its website, it is a private estate owned by the Queen comprising commercial, agricultural and residential properties and a portfolio of financial investments. What’s more, the chancellor of the duchy answers parliamentary questions “on matters relating to his duchy responsibilities”. Kettle is, however, spot-on when he states that “we are adults, entitled to discuss the constitutional monarchy under which we live”. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, should take note.Paul TattamChinley, Derbyshire  Thankfully, the Speaker only has jurisdiction over the Commons, and not over the many parliaments of cafes, pubs, clubs, Twitter and Facebook, where discussion of the UK constitution can be robust and unhindered by Erskine May.Robin Le MareAllithwaite, Cumbria  Martin Kettle is right, that while Britain remains a constitutional monarchy, it is absurd that the crown can’t be discussed in parliament. No doubt that means 30 January, the day in 1649 when Westminster saw the world’s first parliamentary democracy instituted, will pass without note in the Commons. Another bit of history Boris Johnson probably prefers not to remember.Keith FlettTottenham, London  If I understand constitutional monarchy correctly, the UK parliament has had the ultimate authority to determine the monarch since it turfed James II out. Thus there should be no doubt that parliament has the right to question the monarchy insofar as it affects the governance of the state or the credibility of the constitutional monarchy system. Here in Canada, our parliament does not have the authority to determine the monarch.

1/29/2022,"The “Sam Vimes ‘Boots’ theory of socioeconomic unfairness” (Cost-of-living crisis: Jack Monroe hails ONS update of inflation calculations, 26 January) was not invented by Terry Pratchett. Paul Jennings expressed exactly the same idea in his Observer column Oddly Enough in 1954: “You find, for instance, that you have got to have a new pair of shoes, so you rush into a shop and buy some; some cheap ones, and they are worn out in three months. But if you were on one of the inner platforms [Jennings’ term for the rich] you would go calmly into a rather splendid shop and buy the sort of shoes that are bought by men on leave in London from Africa, or down from their Scottish moorland estates.  “Twenty years later these men are still wearing the same shoes, they photograph them with mud on, they write letters which may be inspected at the head office of the shoe firm. But the point is that after these twenty years, inner circle men have spent far less on shoes than outside men.” I don’t know whether Terry Pratchett was aware of this article when he wrote Men at Arms, but the similarity is striking.Peter JohnstoneSt John’s College, Cambridge  Larry Elliott reports that the Office for National Statistics plans to give a much wider range of information with the official price index, so that others can examine how prices for the poor go up faster than they do for the better off. At one time, the separate pensioner price index made this absolutely clear. Perhaps that’s why George Osborne abolished it in 2014. Here at Canterbury and District food bank, we checked the rate of increase in the cost of the standard food parcel we supply. It rose by 6.5% in 2020, and over 7% in 2021, while the official consumer price index rose just 1.2% and 5.4%. This is an emergency. We need the £20 uplift in universal credit restored and a serious food plan for the UK.Peter Taylor-GoobyProfessor of social policy, University of Kent  It’s good news that the Office of National Statistics has listened to Jack Monroe, and is looking to publish revised inflation estimates that reflect the real impact on the poorest UK citizens. Perhaps we can go further, and use the same kind of approach to assess the government’s plans for “levelling up”.

Is it just because I’m white?, 26 January), in which he recounts an incident of racism, ends with “I wish I’d had a quiet word.” He’s right. Although there are, depressingly, thousands of accounts of racist remarks and actions towards non-white people, the truth is that racism is a white problem. In any place where white people gather with people of colour not present, be they places of work, sport, or social, there is often one person who will make a misplaced remark that crosses the line from banter to inferred insult. When that happens their companions usually smirk, make no comment, or turn away. This gives the miscreant the tacit impression that their words are acceptable, and they repeat the behaviour. As Adrian says, something should be said. Nothing heavy, just “That’s out of order, mate” or “It’s not on”. Most racists will not show themselves for what they are in front of non-white people, but they seem to have no problem in doing so in front of their own race. And it’s there that they must be stopped.Malcolm McKayLondon   Thanks to Adrian Chiles for writing about his experience in a Smethwick car park, where he had a pleasant exchange with a woman of south Asian heritage followed by a white man referring to “that lot” with some disparaging remarks.

1/29/2022,"In her review of the TV programme Jay Blades: Learning to Read at 51, Lucy Mangan notes that there are 8 million adults in the UK who struggle with reading. Also, as about 25% of state school pupils do not meet the expected reading standards by the age of 11, it seems that things aren’t going to improve any day soon. In 1999, Sir Claus Moser was commissioned by the government to produce a report on adult literacy and numeracy (known as the Moser report). In this he concluded that 23% of adults in this country had low literacy skills and recommended a national strategy to improve the situation.  However, despite successive governments having spent billions of pounds on a variety of programmes to rectify this, in almost 25 years there has been little or no improvement. If we really do wish to “level up”, surely this is the one area where resources should be directed. One thing the investment in these various literacy projects has thrown up over the years is a huge amount of practical evidence, which can point the way to how future programmes could be successful. With 22% of the population living in poverty, it is surely the time to recognise the old adage and not just “give a man a fish” but to teach him to fish so that he may feed himself and his family for life. Improving adult literacy (and numeracy) is the starting point.Sue HunterBrockenhurst, Hampshire  Like Lucy Mangan, I was moved by Jay Blades’ account of his struggle to read. I too weep at the numbers who fail, but I would take issue with the educational psychologist who stops short of explaining this failure by simply quoting the correlation between poverty/free school meals and illiteracy. It is not poverty or lack of parental support that causes a child in school to fail to read. In my experience as a special educational needs teacher, it was those factors which prevented many children from breaking through the far more damaging pressure of being forced to learn to read and write too young. No other language culture in Europe expects children to code and decode written language before they are six or seven years old. Our children have their confidence destroyed by being required at the age of four or five to read and write a language they have barely mastered speaking; that and the doctrinaire and narrow teaching method of synthetic phonics.Jenny HartlandYork  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

1/29/2022,"The trial of six men accused of stealing 18th-century jewels from a German museum has begun in Dresden amid tight security and questions over whether the treasures will ever be recovered. The defendants, who are brothers and cousins aged between 23 and 28, appeared in court in handcuffs and holding large folders in front of their faces. They had slung jackets over their heads to avoid being photographed.  Proceedings are being held in Dresden’s district court, where the men appeared behind tall safety glass. In accordance with German judicial practice, they have been referred to only by the initial of their family name, R. Media reports, however, have identified them as part of a Berlin clan consisting of 10 families and more than1,000 membersthat has been held responsible for other high-level heists in recent years. The men are accused of aggravated gang theft and serious arson, according to Dresden’s public prosecutor’s office. The robbery took place in November 2019 when masked men broke into the city’s Grünes Gewölbe, or Green Vault, and stole 21 items of jewellery containing more than 4,300 diamonds and valued at just under €114m (£95m). In what appears to have been a carefully choreographed heist, the planning for which began in the previous summer, the robbers first set light to a circuit-breaker panel, plunging the street lighting around the palace housing the museum into darkness. In the early hours of the morning of 25 November, several people then entered the elaborate marble and mirror-clad room housing the jewels and smashed a glass cabinet with an axe 56 times in less than 30 seconds before leaning over the splinters to seize the items with fishing twine. The items included an epaulette, a rapier, two shoe buckles, a hat pin, brooches, a gem from the Polish Order of the White Eagle, a large diamond rose and several skirt buttons. The robbers used fire extinguisher foam to cover their tracks and made off quickly in their Audi getaway car. It is thought the entire robbery took about 10 minutes. The Audi was set on fire in an underground car park before the men drove in a Mercedes disguised as a taxi back to Berlin. Two of the suspects on trial have already been sentenced to four and a half years in prison for their involvement in stealing the Big Maple Leaf, a 100kg gold coin worth €3.7m from Berlin’s Bode Museum in 2017. The accused were seized after a year-long investigation by 40 officers, which included a series of raids involving hundreds more police who arrested three of the men in November 2020 and the other three in the following months. The stolen items were acquired in the 18th century by Augustus the Strong, the elector of Saxony and later king of Poland, who had a fierce rivalry with France’s King Louis XIV which extended to their collections of precious jewels. The jewels survived Allied bombing raids during the second world war but were subsequently removed by Red Army soldiers and seized as war booty. They were returned to Dresden in 1958. Authorities initially offered reward of €500,000 to anyone who would lead police to the jewellery’s whereabouts. That has since been raised to €1.5m after a private initiative to collect donations. The defendants have so far refused to answer questions. The head of the Dresden art collections, Marion Ackermann, has said she reviewed security measures at her museums after the coin robbery at the Bode, where serious security breaches including a faulty alarm system and a broken window were discovered to have facilitated the theft. The Dresden robbers, however, still managed to prepare for their heist unnoticed a week beforehand by using a hydraulic bolt cutter to slice a hole in a window grate that they then glued together again to disguise the break. On the night of the crime, a scanner that creates invisible barriers that trigger an alarm was switched off , though how this occurred is unclear. The robbers’ presence in the building was only noticed when they appeared on security cameras, but it was considered too dangerous to apprehend them and they had escaped before police arrived. Among the questions it is hoped the trial will answer is whether the robbers had help from insiders at the museum. Evidence suggests they were aware of parts of the museum that security cameras were unable to detect. Ackermann said before the trial that she lived in hope that the items had not been broken up for the sale of the individual diamonds and was optimistic that publicity surrounding the trial would raise awareness of them among people in the trade who might be invited to buy them. The Green Vault’s director, Marius Winzeler, told German media: “We will not rest until we have the jewels back.” The trial, involving 14 defence lawyers from across Germany, three prosecutors and representatives of the juvenile court because of the age of two of the defendants, twin brothers, at the time of the crime, is expected to continue at least until the end of October. Prosecutors are separately continuing to investigate 40 further people in relation to the heist, including four men who are suspected of entering the museum disguised as tourists to gather strategic information about its security, layout and personnel movements.",News/World news,Trial opens of six men accused of daring £95m Dresden jewellery heist,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/trial-opens-of-six-men-accused-of-daring-95m-dresden-jewellery-heist
1/29/2022,"My friend Jan Dungey, who has died aged 68, was a founder of Cunning Stunts, an all-female theatre company that performed at festivals, village halls and clubs around the UK – as well as in women’s prisons and psychiatric units – between 1977 and 1982. Jan was also a performer with the company as it created a spontaneous form of theatre that was socially aware and non-elitist, highlighting “the absurdity of male behaviour” and flouting the prevailing glamorous image of women as entertainers.  A force to be reckoned with and standing at 6ft 2in, she was a memorable presence wherever she went, a beautiful and fearless woman who carried a bright flame of inspiration that was fanned by her determination, intelligence and infectious humour. Jan had a powerful singing voice, and also performed blues and country songs at some of the countercultural Albion Fairs that took place around East Anglia in the early 1980s. After the demise of Cunning Stunts she decamped to Bungay in Suffolk, which became home for the rest of her life. There she conceived and set up the Company of Imagination (1986-91), a multidisciplinary group that created site-specific outdoor promenade performances, known as “animated trails”, in rural and urban settings. Many of the company’s projects were created with schoolchildren, enabling them to explore, understand and respond to their local environment. Jan was instrumental in making sure that most of the projects were funded by an unusual mix of environmental, built-heritage and arts bodies. She was born in Maidstone in Kent, to Grace (nee Murdoch), a secretary, and her husband, James Dungey, an architect and surveyor. After attending Maidstone girls’ grammar school, she took a degree in English literature at Bristol University from 1971 to 1974 and then did performance studies for a year at Bretton Hall College of Education in West Yorkshire. When the Company of Imagination folded in the early 90s, Jan had stints as a council arts officer in Maidstone and then Great Yarmouth in Norfolk. Local authorities were not her natural home, and although she managed to be of great help to the creative sectors in both towns, including through setting up SeaChange Arts (now Out There Arts), an independent arts development charity in Great Yarmouth, she frequently ran up against the system that employed her. In 2000 she returned to freelance and self-directed projects. Despite having been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the late 90s she continued to initiate many creative projects, and in 2010 was a co-founder of Waveney & Blyth Arts on the Norfolk-Suffolk border. After 20 years of the creeping paralysis of MS, Jan was undone by Covid-19. She is survived by her long-term partner, Steve Cooke, whom she met when he was an electrician helping to set up the Albion Fairs.",Arts/Art and design,Jan Dungey obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/28/jan-dungey-obituary
1/29/2022,"The comedian Joe Lycett, who apparently caused chaos and “mass panic” in government when he tweeted a fake version of Sue Gray’s “partygate” report, has said his social media stunt was motivated by anger after the death of a close friend during the first lockdown. Lycett tweeted a parody Gray report with a fake Cabinet Office letterhead, titled: “A summary of my main findings”, captioning his tweet: “BREAKING: Leaked Sue Gray report reveals shocking abuse of rules. Hard to see how the PM can cling on after this.”  BREAKING: Leaked Sue Gray report reveals shocking abuse of the rules. Hard to see how the PM can cling on after this. pic.twitter.com/l0IQMcio0t He later shared a message that he said came “from someone who works for a cabinet minister. Source verified.” The message, purportedly from someone who works in parliament, read: “Your tweet this morning was read as an actual serious leak from Sue Gray’s report. U had MP staff literally running around panicking from what it said. Panic dialling MPs like we need to discuss this right now.” Among the “findings” on his faked document, Lycett stated that at one party a “senior minister” insisted all cabinet ministers get on to a table and perform Pure & Simple by Hear’Say, that one of Johnson’s staff was referred to as “Twateral Flow”, and that a video of Johnson’s wife, Carrie, confirmed her attendance and she was overheard saying “it could be as few as four and as many as 60 kids”. Games were played called “Slow Dance” and “Pass the Arsehole”, the fake findings said. He finished the fake report with: “Please forward any queries to my email ItsAllSueGravyBaby@aol.com.” Explaining his motivation, Lycett tweeted on Friday: “I wrote some jokes on Twitter, some dumb people (some in our government) found them plausible rather than funny and now I’m in most of the newspapers. “I write comedy sometimes as a way of using anger”. He said he was “angry right now probably for the same reason many other people are angry”. He explained that his best friend died from cancer in 2020 but he was unable to be there for him “because I was following the rules”. “So I suppose like thousands of others with their own stories, I’m angry about that.”",News/Politics,Joe Lycett says Sue Gray report stunt motivated by anger over friend’s death,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/28/joe-lycett-sue-gray-report-stunt-motivated-anger-friends-death
1/29/2022,"Scotland Yard’s statement that it has asked for “minimal references” to certain events covered in Sue Gray’s report provoked confusion and anger. The effect of Friday’s intervention was to diminish the chances of Gray’s report being published in full any time soon. It also heightened speculation about what the force is actually investigating.  Scotland Yard said it did not want Gray’s report to “prejudice” its own inquiries – which had only begun when the civil servant shared her findings with the Met last weekend. So, has Gray been snookered by talking to the police? Experts say this isn’t the case. The Met’s request is just that – it has no legal force. “They have no legal power to cause a redaction or the report being published in some shorter version,” said Nazir Afzal, former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England. With respect to the prejudice the Met are trying to avoid, some lawyers suggested it may refer to the risk of unfairly influencing any court case. However, contempt of court only applies when proceedings are “active”, usually when someone has been arrested. “I am sure that there would have been an announcement if someone had been summonsed or charged, and so I think that can be discounted,” said Kate Bex QC, a criminal barrister at Red Lion chambers. “There is an active police investigation, but that is different to proceedings being ongoing.” Also, none of the crimes committed by individuals under the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations, which covers social gatherings during lockdowns, can be tried by jury. At the lowest level are fixed penalty notices, which are issued by police, with the only alternative being a magistrates court hearing or a case dealt with under the single justice procedure, where rulings are made by a single magistrate sitting with a legal adviser. Given this, some raised the prospect that the Met’s statement indicated it was investigating offences that could be tried before a jury. The Green party peer, Jenny Jones, has called on the police to investigate misconduct in public office – where a public officer wilfully neglects his or her duty and which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment – in respect to the alleged breaches. Similarly, there have been suggestions that officers could be investigating perverting the court of justice, which also carries a maximum sentence of life, over possible attempts to cover up wrongdoing. This was fuelled by a report in the Independent that No 10 advised staff to “clean up” their phones amid allegations about lockdown parties. But the Met seemed to scotch this idea on Friday when it clarified it was looking only at possible breaches of Covid rules – equivalent to a parking fine. Andrew Keogh, a barrister who runs the CrimeLine website, said the police were likely to be attempting to protect their hand when carrying out their own interviews. “If there’s any level of detail in the report about the alleged events, naming people and accounts of what went on and who might have initiated this, that and the other, then it seems to me from a policing points of view you wouldn’t want that in the public domain. “You want to put things to people so they’re sort of blinded by it, so: ‘Were you in the basement of number 10 on this date?’, they say no, and then you say: ‘Well, we’ve just spoken to John Doe and John Doe says: “You were dancing on the photocopier etc.’ “This is quite powerful, playing off lots of people against each other and holding the cards to your chest as to whatever evidence you do have and, as importantly, what evidence you don’t have.” Afzal agreed that a fear of “contaminating evidence” might be behind the Met’s move but said it was misguided given that witnesses would already have had plenty of time to confer, as well as the wider public interest in the case. “This is not a subject that has been in the shadows,” he said. “People have been talking about this for weeks and months. I have little doubt that witnesses have discussed this, so the idea that something will be said in this report that might contaminate the case, I think, is an exaggerated risk. Anyway, they’ve got to balance that with public confidence and the court of public opinion. “They want this report in full because they’ve been promised it in full. As recently as three days ago the Met said they had no objections to it being published in full and so it makes no sense. All it is doing is feeding a perception that there is some kind of collusion going on between government and policing.”",News/Politics,Met’s request for Sue Gray report redactions only muddies the picture,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/28/mets-request-for-sue-gray-report-redactions-only-muddies-the-picture
1/29/2022,"An intensive care doctor who challenged the health secretary, Sajid Javid, over compulsory Covid vaccines for NHS staff has launched a legal bid against the government to end the policy. Dr Steve James, who is unvaccinated and works as an anaesthetist at King’s College hospital, is seeking a judicial review with seven other medical professionals. It would look at the lawfulness of the decision to require health professionals to be jabbed.  The government directive requires all NHS staff in England who have direct contact with patients to get two Covid-19 vaccinations by 1 April or risk losing their jobs. However, critics have argued that imposing a deadline could lead to staff shortages. James and other NHS staff, represented by the legal firm Jackson Osborne, have submitted a document to the high court calling for a review. The document argues the decision to impose the mandate “is itself unlawful, irrational, and disproportionate”. James became known to the public after he confronted Javid as the minister visited King’s College hospital in south London. In an encounter captured by Sky News, Javid had asked doctors and nurses what they thought about government plans to require vaccination for all NHS staff. After a brief silence, the consultant anaesthetist, who has been working throughout the pandemic, said: “I’m not happy about that.” James told Javid: “I’ve had Covid at some point, I’ve got antibodies, and I’ve been working on Covid ITUs since the beginning; I have not had a vaccination, I do not want to have a vaccination. The vaccine is reducing transmission only for about eight weeks with Delta. With Omicron it’s probably less. And for that I would be dismissed if I don’t have a vaccine? The science isn’t strong enough.” “That’s your view,” Javid replied. Turning to a group of nurses, he asked: “And your views?” However, they did not respond. Turning back to James, Javid continued: “I respect that but there are also many different views.” Javid added: “I understand that but obviously we have to weigh all that up for both health and social care, and there will always be a debate about it.” James replied: “Maybe there is an opportunity to reconsider with Omicron and the changing picture, or at least the nuance that will allow doctors who have had antibody exposure, who’ve got antibodies, who haven’t had the vaccination, to not have it, because the protection I’ve got is probably equivalent to someone who is vaccinated.”",News/Society,Group of NHS medics launch legal bid against compulsory Covid jabs,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/28/group-of-nhs-medics-launch-legal-bid-against-compulsory-covid-jabs-england
1/29/2022,"Faced with the fight of his political life, Boris Johnson now risks being held hostage by assertive Tory backbenchers making demands on a range of fronts including national insurance and vaccine mandates. Other policies are also now stuck in paralysis while the shadow of the Sue Gray report – and a Scotland Yard investigation – hangs over the government, with senior Tory backbencher Roger Gale describing Johnson as a “lame duck” prime minister on Friday. Here are the policies at the mercy of the political storm.  National insurance contributions (NICs) The Treasury became increasingly alarmed at signs Johnson may be preparing to scrap the national insurance rise in the face of pressure from rightwing Tories. The Guardian reported on Thursday Rishi Sunak had been privately stressing to MPs that the tax rise must go ahead as planned. On Friday No 10 insisted there was no policy change. Obesity strategy Faced with a potential rebellion, Johnson signalled this week that he was prepared to drop plans to tighten regulations on the promotion of unhealthy food and drinks. The plans were part of an anti-obesity strategy that the prime minister himself had promoted in 2020 to prevent supermarkets from displaying unhealthy food and drinks at checkouts or using them in buy one, get one free offers. Animal welfare There was no noise from the prime minister when the chief whip, Mark Spencer, suggested the animal sentience legislation should be watered down to avoid rows with his backbenches. Senior Tory sources have confirmed to the Guardian that a series of policies including a ban on trophy hunting imports, stricter sentences for puppy thieves and a ban on live exports of livestock have been put on pause after a campaign led by Spencer, a farmer. Cost of living crisis Johnson and Sunak had reportedly been due to meet this week to consider options including council tax rebates and a bonus universal credit payment. Measures to soften energy bill hikes are also caught in the logjam, amid a standoff with the Treasury on how to fund measures to ease the cost of living crisis. The clock is ticking, however, with the energy regulator Ofgem due to announce the latest increase to the price cap on 7 February, which, as it stands, will increase the average annual gas and electricity bill by about 50% to more than £2,000 when it kicks in from April. Vaccine mandates Johnson has come under sustained pressure from Tory backbenchers to do a U-turn on rules obliging NHS England staff to have a first jab by 3 February to allow time to be fully vaccinated by 1 April. The prime minister resisted concerted calls by Tory MPs in the House of Commons for the mandate to be dropped, but at one point told Mark Harper that the government would “reflect”. Levelling up The levelling up white paper was expected to be launched this week but has been pushed back due to the political turmoil. It is the latest delay for the flagship policy designed to spread prosperity outside London and the south-east, after the Omicron wave forced ministers to push back a planned publication before Christmas. It is widely expected to see the light of day next week, however, as Boris Johnson seeks to relaunch his government and repair his public image, while the Met continues its work. Education A logjam of bills and policies inherited by Nadhim Zahawi has not been improved by the torpor at Downing Street, as white papers and legislation form a tailback. A bill about freedom of speech in England’s universities ended its committee stages in September but there is no word when it will move on. A skills and post-16 education bill is also waiting for a date to continue. Other overdue policies include the long-awaited review of special education needs and disabilities, now being folded into a white paper on schools to be finished later this year. Gambling Proposals for a once-in-generation review of gambling laws were initially scheduled for the end of 2021 but were delayed until this year, as Johnson reshuffled his Cabinet. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, headed by Nadine Dorries, is now expected to publish a white paper in March. However, sources familiar with the review process say that even that date could now slip, given the chaos in Westminster.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson’s agenda gripped by paralysis as he fights to survive,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/28/boris-johnson-agenda-gripped-by-paralysis-as-he-fights-to-survive
1/29/2022,"The BBC is to use disinformation specialists to vet potential Question Time audience members after the programme called for unvaccinated members of the public to take part. Next week’s episode of the current affairs discussion show will feature unvaccinated individuals in the audience after an appeal from the presenter, Fiona Bruce, broadcast earlier this month.  Question Time’s decision to seek out vaccine refuseniks follows concern at the BBC that the show has failed to represent the views of the 10% of the adult British population who have not had a jab. But one of the main social media channels used to organise an attempt by anti-vaxx activists to storm the offices of Britain’s medical regulator has also been used to encourage people to apply to the BBC programme, according to now deleted messages. “Applied,” said one user on a popular anti-vaccine activist Telegram channel, who posted a reply they had received from the BBC confirming that their application to appear in the audience had been received. Others on the channel, used to organise anti-lockdown campaigns and oppose vaccines, said they would apply. Since Question Time returned with live audiences last year it has asked about people’s vaccination status when they apply online to go in the audience. This appears to have put off those who have declined to be injected from applying to go on the show – meaning there have rarely been any questions from people who are unvaccinated. “There are still substantial numbers of the British public who are not vaccinated, especially in particular areas and communities,” said a BBC spokesperson. “We think this is an interesting part of the debate which is worthy of discussion. Question Time always strives to discuss each side of every argument. This is about listening to, and understanding, our audience members. The BBC has always made the scientific consensus on vaccination very clear.” The issue facing the BBC is how to find “ordinary” unvaccinated members of the public, rather than obsessive anti-vaxx activists, and whether it is possible to distinguish between the two groups. The BBC also runs the risk of broadcasting dangerous medical disinformation to millions of viewers. In an attempt to weed out the more obsessive campaigners, the BBC has decided to employ its in-house disinformation specialists to help with vetting potential audience members, although it is unclear what criteria will be used. Next week’s episode is being filmed at a location in London, which has some of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, and medical experts will sit on the panel to answer questions about vaccine take-up. Rather than dedicate an entire programme to the topic of vaccination, as Question Time has done in the past on certain key topics, discussions of vaccines will be dealt with as part of a wider range of issues. Asked about the health concerns of inviting unvaccinated individuals into the audience at a time when there are still 100,000 new confirmed Covid cases every day, a BBC spokesperson said they would still have to show evidence of a recent negative test to gain access. The decision to seek out the unvaccinated comes amid ongoing debate about what BBC impartiality really means – and whether every viewpoint should be given a hearing on the public broadcaster. This month the BBC’s editorial standards chief, David Jordan, attempted to define which views should be given airtime on the BBC during a parliamentary hearing, saying he opposed “cancel culture” and remained “committed to ensuring that viewpoints are heard from all different sorts of perspectives”. Jordan said everyone should expect their views to be appropriately represented by the national broadcaster – even if they believed the Earth is flat. “It’s critical to the BBC that we represent all points of view and give them due weight. Flat-Earthers are not going to get as much space as people who believe the Earth is round, but very occasionally it might be appropriate to interview a flat-Earther. And if a lot of people believed in flat Earth we’d need to address it more.”",Arts/Television & radio,BBC to vet Question Time audience after call for unvaccinated to appear,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/28/bbc-to-vet-question-time-audience-after-call-for-unvaccinated-to-appear

They currently sit second in the Premiership, eight points behind leaders Leicester ahead of Sunday’s visit to Wasps, and could yet qualify for the knockout stage of the European Challenge Cup.  The 54-year-old also steered Saracens through their season in the Championship in 2020-21 following their relegation for breaching salary cap regulations. Under his stewardship the club clinched the European and domestic double in both 2015-16 and 2018-19. McCall is understood to have been at Saracens’ training ground this week but, for now, overall control of first-team affairs will pass to head coach Joe Shaw and assistants Dan Vickers, Kevin Sorrell, Ian Peel and Adam Powell. “People will always come first at our club and Mark will be given all of the support and time he needs,” read the Saracens’ statement. “Mark is obviously more than confident in the coaching team he has worked with for many years to temporarily take the reins.” McCall has repeatedly made clear that Saracens believe in collective leadership. “We were very determined when this began years ago that the club would never be reliant on one person,” he said last year. “It would be a very poor organisation, a very average organisation, which does that.” Saracens also have the benefit of being able to select Mako and Billy Vunipola this weekend alongside fellow England internationals Ben Earl, Alex Lozowski and Alex Goode.
