5/11/2022,"Law enforcement officers in Indiana warned each other about the gun Vicky White had in her hand as they discussed how to retrieve her from her flipped vehicle, according to footage of the incident released by the Evansville Police Department on Tuesday. In one video, officers on the scene crouch in the grassy ditch by the overturned Cadillac, minutes after a U.S. Marshal rammed it, ending both a short police chase and White’s 11-day stint on the run with a murder suspect. The 56-year-old assistant director of corrections shot herself “almost instantaneously” before deputies could reach her, Vanderburgh County Sheriff Dave Wedding said at a Tuesday press conference. Vicky is unresponsive but “still breathing” in the footage, according to one officer discussing how to get her out. A suggestion to pop the front windshield off is quickly disregarded. “Anybody got a Hooligan?” someone asks, referencing a Halligan bar, a tool with a pick-end used by officers to force entry. https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2497518180379075 Eventually, the officer is handed the tool. He lowers himself onto his stomach. “I’m gonna go for the gun,” he says, retrieving the gun from White. In the partially censored footage, he then pulls the guard out of the sunroof by her wrists, with other officers helping to drag her onto grass and gravel. First responders then close in to administer first aid. In another video released by Indiana authorities, escaped inmate Casey White, no relation to Vicky, is seen being taken into custody after the chase. Authorities said that Casey had wanted to end his time on the lam with a police shootout, but a U.S. Marshal ramming the couple’s car during the chase swiftly put an end to that plan. After he emerged from the Cadillac uninjured, more than half a dozen officers crowded the 6-foot-9-inch-tall man, handcuffing him on the ground. Casey is marched away as officers continue to swarm the flipped car and surrounding area. The pair originally vanished from their Lauderdale County, Alabama, jail on April 29. On Tuesday, Sheriff Wedding told reporters that the lovebirds had driven to a cheap Indiana motel and holed up, trying to figure out where to go next. Casey, 38, was extradited back to Lauderdale County on Monday. A day later, a judge set a June trial date for his original murder charge—the “brutal” 2015 stabbing of a 58-year-old woman. Vicky was transported to a hospital, where she was declared dead on Monday night, according to police. Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said Tuesday that $29,000 had been found in the Whites’ car, along with several wigs and a cache of weapons, including an AR-15 rifle and 9mm handguns. Casey had so far shown “no remorse” over his prison guard lover’s death, Singleton added. Read more at The Daily Beast.

5/11/2022,"Accusations by women — including a GOP state senator — who said Charles Herbster groped them shook up the Nebraska gubernatorial race. (Photo: Kenneth Ferriera/Lincoln Journal Star via AP) Charles Herbster, accused of sexually assaulting eight women, lost the Republican primary for Nebraska governor Tuesday to University of Nebraska Regent Jim Pillen. The race was largely a three-way contest between Herbster, a multimillionaire agribusiness executive; State Sen. Brett Lindstrom and Pillen. In 2021, Pillen introduced a resolution to bar the teaching of critical race theory from the university system. The Board of Regents, however, voted it down. Yet much of the attention on the race focused around Herbster ― both his association with Donald Trump and his controversies. Herbster is a longtime donor and ally of the former president, and he received a boost when the Trump endorsed him late last year. Trump went to the state to campaign for him as recently as May 1 and held a tele-rally less than a week before the election. Trump ― who himself faces accusations of rape, assault and harassment from even more women ― called Herbster a “fine man” and said “he is innocent of these despicable charges.” “I have to defend my friends, I have to defend people that are good,” he told the crowd. “These are malicious charges to derail him long enough that the election can go by before the proper defense can be put forward.” Trump’s endorsement of Herbster did not please many Republicans in the state. Last year, outgoing Gov. Pete Ricketts (R) asked the former president to remain neutral. Ricketts later endorsed Pillen, saying Herbster would be a “terrible governor.” Eight women accused Herbster of groping them, including a state senator in his own party. State Sen. Julie Slama told the Nebraska Examiner that in 2019, she was at a GOP fundraising dinner when she walked by Herbster. According to the Examiner, “he reached up her skirt, without her consent, and touched her inappropriately.” Another woman who attended the same dinner and has worked as a legislative aide in Nebraska, said Herbster also assaulted her at the same dinner. “For years I have struggled with an experience I had with Charles W. Herbster,” Elizabeth Todsen said. “At a political event in 2019, Herbster sexually groped me while greeting my table.” Herbster took a page out of Trump’s playbook, denying the allegations and attacking the women who made the accusations. He even sued Slama for defamation, calling her claims “part of a greater scheme calculated to try and defeat my candidacy.” But the accusations took their toll, and Herbster lost his momentum. All 13 women in the Nebraska state Senate ― which includes both Democrats and Republicans ― signed a letter saying that Herbster’s alleged behavior was “completely unacceptable” and that he was “unfit to serve.” Trump won Nebraska by 19 percentage points in the 2020 election, and there hasn’t been a Democratic governor there in decades. Pillen will face Democratic state Sen. Carol Blood in November.

5/11/2022,"A driver with Brink’s security used his company-issued clear lunch bag to steal more than $1 million from ATMs at Michigan banks and credit unions, officials said. The driver — who stopped showing up to work after he is believed to have stolen from 24 teller machines on six days — is now being charged in federal court. His last day of work was Dec. 28, the sixth day money was stolen from ATMs. Authorities say Reginald Carman, 23, stole $1,060,200 in cash from seven federally insured financial institutions while working as a driver who serviced their ATMs, according to a criminal complaint filed in court. While most of the money has been returned in its “original ‘bricked’ or ‘strapped’ condition,” authorities say $22,260 was still missing as of the March court filing. Carman’s defense attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment from McClatchy News on May 10. After Carman was caught, the man did admit to a Brink’s regional security manager that he had been stealing money, according to court records. “Carman advised that his father had recently passed away and his mind was not right when he was stealing the money,” authorities said. “(He) said he did not spend any of the money and did not think about spending the money.” Authorities note that some of the bricks of cash returned were “loose,” and four bricks are short a total of $3,720. This is included in the $22,260 still missing. Brink’s did not immediately respond to a request for comment from McClatchy News on May 10. On Jan. 6, a credit unit representative reported to the FBI that its ATMs have been short about $350,000 since the middle of December, records say. The representative said Brink’s notified the credit union of the discrepancy. The next day, a special agent says he spoke with a Brink’s regional security manager. The manager reported he was investigating the earlier incident and identified Carman as the driver who had serviced those machines. In Dec. 21 video footage, Carman was seen placing what appeared to be a “Brink’s clear bag full of currency into a Brink’s clear bag/lunch box,” according to court records. Those bags are issued to workers so lunch and personal belongings can be seen by surveillance. “Later in the day, shortly before arriving back at the Brink’s Lansing branch, (he) stopped the truck, looked out of the truck windows, grabbed the Brink’s clear bag/lunch box, and exited the truck with the Brink’s clear bag/lunch box, taking it to what appeared to be a dark-colored truck or sport utility vehicle,” officials said. Brink’s security noted the bag appeared “full and heavy,” as Carmen used both hands to pick it up, according to the complaint. But earlier footage shows the bag “appeared to be light and mostly empty at the start of Carman’s shift.” When Carman was asked to return the money, officials say he gave back about $650,000 — more than Brink’s estimated was missing. During the Jan. 6 meeting, Carman “said he could not justify his actions regarding the thefts and that he did not have a reason for stealing the money,” according to court records. He also admitted to using the clear bag to steal money, and he signed a statement saying he stole from the ATMs. As Brink’s continued to investigate, authorities identified Carman as a suspect in more thefts at more banks. “I don’t even know at this point,” Carman is recorded saying on Jan. 12 when asked which institutions he stole from. He also returned more money and “said he knew that his actions were wrong and that he did not know why he stole money or why he did not stop stealing money.” Carman met with the investigator on several occasions throughout the investigation, turning in more money as it continued, officials said. Authorities believe Carman is responsible for thefts that occurred from Nov. 15 to Dec. 28. Of the $1,060,200 that was stolen, Carman has returned $1,037,940. Carman was indicted on 12 counts of bank larceny in federal court on April 19. A jury trial has been scheduled for June 28. Duped ‘lottery winners’ swindled out of $460,000, feds say.

5/11/2022,"Prince Charles stepped in for ailing Queen Elizabeth II on Tuesday to open Britain’s Parliament, a deeply symbolic moment in British royal history that gave the clearest glimpse yet of the contours of the post-Elizabethan world. Her Majesty left her decision to Monday afternoon to finally pull the plug on her scheduled role of opening the new legislative session, inevitably sparking fresh concerns that she is considerably more unwell than the palace—which cited “episodic mobility problems”—is letting on. Queen Elizabeth Will Skip Her Own Garden Parties, Stoking Health Fears Notably, Prince Charles, who was decked out in his military uniform, sat on a throne to read the Queen’s Speech (which is actually written by the government but traditionally delivered by the monarch) although it had previously been rumored he would avail of more humble seating options. Her Majesty’s crown rested symbolically on a velvet cushion on a small table next to him. Prince William sat on Charles’ right, wearing a dark morning suit; Camilla, his wife, sat on Charles’ left. They both sat on relatively normal chairs. While the queen would traditionally refer to “my government,” Charles referred to “Her Majesty’s government” throughout the speech. The palace said William and Charles were jointly opening Parliament, in their roles as counselors of state, and that the queen was watching the ceremony on television at Windsor Castle. The decision of Elizabeth to pull out of the event at the last minute has served to deepen national anxiety about her health, which has become a source of much comment since the death of her husband, Prince Philip, last year. The official line is that the queen has “mobility problems”—the terminology was updated in a briefing Monday to become “episodic mobility problems”—but this explanation is increasingly thought to be a major understatement, especially in light of the legal mechanism that the queen used to step away from Tuesday’s commitment: the Regency Act. The only time Britain has had a formal regency is under George III, who was periodically declared insane. George IV, the heir, was made regent and took on all his father’s duties. It is not unprecedented for the monarch not to make the ceremony. The queen has actually missed the state opening of Parliament twice, while she was pregnant, in 1959 (with Anne) and 1963 (with Edward). Queen Victoria regularly skipped this particularly duty, sending the crown on a velvet cushion, just as the queen did today. But an important if slightly obscure point is that on those occasions the monarchs asked a senior parliamentary official to fill in for her, essentially, an ad hoc basis. The big difference concerning Monday’s move was that the queen a) put her heir, Charles, in her place rather than using a mere functionary for the task and b) according to royal historian Robert Hardman, author of the new biography Queen of Our Times, she did so by invoking the Regency Act of 1937 and, specifically, Section 6 (1) which states: “In the event of illness… the Sovereign may… delegate, for the period of that illness or absence… such of the royal functions as may be specified.” Hardman told The Daily Beast: “The last time that an heir to the throne opened Parliament, he was called the Prince Regent, so it is understandable that is how some people are seeing this. But the fact is that a regency is something that is done on behalf of the monarch, and in this case the monarch has laid down the rules and asked for it to be done, which is an important distinction.” Hardman added that the situation is “genuinely unprecedented” and that that “everyone is slightly scrabbling around trying to figure out what happens next.” He pointed out that the new arrangement is not open-ended, it only applies to today. Charles is not now authorized to open Parliament automatically every year—although in truth it’s hard to imagine the queen now ever reprising the role. Despite the constituional niceties, it is not entirely surprising that the invoking of the Regency Act on as important occasion as the opening of Parliament is being seen by many as the first step toward a regency, although this is something Buckingham Palace calmly but robustly denies, insisting the queen still remains very much in charge. In most senses, she is. There is little doubt that her word is the final one. But today’s appearance by the future King Charles III marks an important line in the sand, and a window into what the future of British pomp and circumstance looks like. Read more at The Daily Beast.

5/11/2022,"A mother was convicted by a Texas jury after allowing her 13-year-old daughter to be sexually abused by the girl’s 47-year-old “husband,” officials say. The mother said the “marriage” between her daughter and the man “was a normal part of her religious beliefs” and that she consented to it, the Fort Bend County District Attorney’s Office. But by Texas law, the girl was too young to be a part of a legal marriage. The false marriage between the child and man went on for nearly a year before authorities learned of it in 2017, after the child revealed information about it during a doctor’s appointment. The 13-year-old said during the 2017 appointment that she was “sexually active with her husband,” according to prosecutors. Her mother was present during the appointment. The 47-year-old man was not the only person to sexually abuse the young girl, prosecutors said during court proceedings. Fort Bend prosecutors said the girl’s mother had also sexually abused the girl years earlier “under the guise of a different religion.” On April 29, a jury convicted the mother of continuous sexual abuse of a young child, and she was sentenced to 30 years in prison. “I take solace in this jury’s verdict, because it says that there’s a consequence awaiting mothers who fail to protect as profoundly as (the defendant) did,” lead prosecutor Charann Thompson said. Caseworkers from Child Protective Services helped support the child during the investigation and trial, prosecutor Jessica Ramos said. The child has been adopted by a new mother. “I applaud this child for her strength and resilience as she continues to recover from the crimes committed against her,” Fort Bend County District Attorney Brian Middleton said. “I pray that she is successful in all of her future endeavors.” House fire that killed 10-year-old uncovers harrowing child abuse claims, GA cops say Woman accused of killing dad says he abused her, AZ cops say. ‘Here to take his life’",U.S./Fort Worth Star-Telegram,"Mom let 47-year-old ‘marry’ her 13-year-old, TX officials say.
