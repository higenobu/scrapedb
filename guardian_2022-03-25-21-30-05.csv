3/25/2022,"Last week the trademark Cheltenham roar could be heard a little more than a mile away. Michael Duff spent training sessions competing with the hum of helicopters parachuting the rich and famous into the Cotswolds but occasionally he asks his squad to tune into another frequency to ensure they stay grounded: the sound of children playing football at Swindon Village primary school next door. “We’ve done it a couple of times at the start of training,” Cheltenham’s manager says. “‘Lads, just listen. Just run around and listen.’ There is no thought of egos or anything like that – they haven’t got an ego because they’re six years old; they’re just running around enjoying themselves. ‘Enjoy yourself, what a great place to be.’” It is an approach inspired by watching Sean Dyche cut players down to size in pursuit of a strong culture at Burnley, where Duff spent 12 seasons as a player, making his Premier League debut at 31, and coached the under-18s and under-23s before returning to Cheltenham, for whom he signed as a trainee in 1997. Cheltenham’s strength stems from the unity fostered by Duff, who lifted the League Two title last season. On taking over he enlisted the help of former Royal Marines, who later put the squad through their paces in the Forest of Dean, leading two players to come to blows. A conversation with Burnley’s sports psychologist, Simon Clarkson, when they discussed John Naber’s approach to shaving four seconds off his 100m backstroke time to win gold at the 1976 Olympics, resonates to this day. “You have to keep chipping away,” he says. “But you can’t cut corners. You get your days off and your family time but when you’re in, you’re in. There’s no going through the motions.” Duff is an affable, engaging and self-deprecating character but the scale of his achievements should be taken seriously. Cheltenham head into Saturday’s trip to Sheffield Wednesday in the top half of League One and on course to eclipse their highest finish, 17th in this division in 2007. Duff believes the feat is unlikely to mean much to anyone beyond “a five-mile radius” but it ought to given only the bottom club, Crewe, are operating on a smaller budget in the division. “There is no point harping on about it: ‘Poor us, poor us,’” says Duff. “If we get beat, it’s not because we’ve got no money, it’s because we weren’t good enough.” They have beaten Ipswich, Charlton and, more recently, Sunderland, after losing the reverse fixture in September. Duff smiles at the image of Dylan Barkers, who joined from Alvechurch last summer, filming the stands on arrival at the Stadium of Light. “We got thumped 5-0 so it wasn’t an enjoyable game – and we did well to get away with a five-niller. But we’ve improved. The good thing is we know what we are. We are ‘little Cheltenham’, but we’re doing all right.” Duff is surely in manager-of-the-season territory. In his time the club have paid a fee for a single player: £5,000 for Alfie May, who has 22 goals this season and caught Pep Guardiola’s eye after opening the scoring against Manchester City in an absorbing FA Cup tie last year, after which Duff “went route one” and gave Guardiola a bottle of rioja before picking his brains. In August Cheltenham were powerless to prevent Wrexham signing their captain Ben Tozer for £200,000. They in effect cannot afford to sign League One players but have had joy borrowing Premier League youngsters, with Callum Wright excelling on loan from Leicester. Initially, the setup can be an eye-opener – Duff sometimes waters the training pitches with a hose pipe and players are made to wear shin pads. Then there are the uncompromising forfeits. “One of them is the glove slap,” says Duff. “They get the goalkeeper’s glove, soak it in water, and then twat them across the face – twice. We often laugh because we say: ‘Can you imagine Ronaldo doing this?’ They have to do roly-polys from 18-yard box to 18-yard box. It’s horrible. But they all do it. Everyone’s the same. Don’t decide: ‘Well, he’s more important than her so I’m going to say hello to him but I’m just going to blank the cleaner.’ It’s a load of nonsense. Just because you’re a footballer, it’s not acceptable to be a knobhead.” For Duff, trips to Hillsborough are poignant given he was three rows back in the main stand on the day of the disaster in 1989. Duff, then an 11-year-old in Nottingham Forest’s school of excellence, attended with his father, John, who spent 50 years in the military and was then based at RAF Leeming. “There was this lad, in my mind he was early 20s, crying his eyes out, tears streaming down his face, trying to rip off this advertising board to create a stretcher,” he recalls. “He went: ‘I’ve got five brothers in there and I can’t find fucking one of them.’ “They started taking what, looking back now, were clearly dead bodies on stretchers into the corner. The horses made a big ‘wall’ on the halfway line and then my dad scooted me off. We nearly got home by the time we got to a payphone. Everyone used to watch the semi-final of the FA Cup. My family was watching it, knowing we were there, but not where we were sat. Every phone box had 25 people outside it, trying to ring home and say: ‘I’m all right.’ I don’t particularly like going back there. It always stirs up strange emotions. It was a sad day.” On days off Duff often finds himself back at the training ground to watch his eldest son, Tommy, who plays for Cheltenham Under-14s. A tee time at his nearby golf course – Duff plays off three – is the only time the phone goes away but he acknowledges the goldfish-bowl feel of being immersed in the town has its pluses and minuses, taking up a story about an evening with his former Burnley teammates Joey Gudjonsson and Steve Jordan. “We had a game on the Saturday so I’d gone: ‘Lads, no one out tonight.’ We went into a piano bar and the girl who walked us in said: ‘I’ve just got to get some people off your table’ … two of my players,” Duff says, deadpan. “To say they looked like they had seen a ghost was an understatement.”",Sport/Football,Michael Duff single-minded as ‘Little Cheltenham’ take giant steps ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/25/michael-duff-single-minded-as-little-cheltenham-take-giant-steps
3/25/2022,"He has survived a record-breaking storm, endured icy mornings when he woke with frost coating his blankets and battled a bout of Covid during a heatwave. But after two years of sleeping under canvas Max Woosey – the boy in the tent – is on the verge of, if not giving up life under the stars, then at least embarking on a new chapter. “I’m still going to be in my tent a lot,” said Max, who has raised more than £700,000 for charity. “But now I’ve done two years, if there’s a big, dangerous storm coming I may come inside, or if we have a trip to London I may stay in a hotel. I’m not going to have to be outside every night any more.” It comes as some relief to his family. Max’s mother, Rachael Woosey, said: “That will make a huge difference – trying to go anywhere and do anything is complicated at the moment.” When the family visited London for an awards ceremony, they had to find a hotel prepared to let Max sleep on a balcony. “It will be really nice to be able to go away and not have to ask ‘How are we going to do this? Where is the tent going to go?’. It will be nice to have a bit of normal family life, and if Max chooses to sleep outside when we’re at home then that’s fine. “It feels like a bit of a transition. Our concern has been that he feels under pressure to do it, but he’s the only one that puts the pressure on. It will be nice that if he’s out there it’s because he wants to be, not because he feels he’s letting anyone down.” Max’s marathon camp began in early 2020 when his mum and dad, Mark Woosey, a Royal Marine, were helping to care for a neighbour, Rick Abbott, who had terminal cancer. The Woosey family saw first-hand how the support of North Devon hospice helped their friend remain in his own home. Just before he died, Abbott gave Max his tent and told him to have an adventure with it. When the first national lockdown was announced in March 2020 and it became clear the hospice would suffer a financial hit, Max decided to do a fundraising camp-out until lockdown was over. He thought it might last a few weeks and he might raise £100. It went on, and on. There have been ups and downs. The ups included camping trips to Downing Street and Twickenham stadium. He has got through about a dozen tents and found that, generally, hot sunshine did more damage than strong wind or rain. Lows included last month’s storms, including Eunice with its record-breaking winds. Max’s father joined him in the tent that night. “The storm didn’t bother me but my dad’s snoring did,” said the 12-year-old. Actually, an invite to a sleepover with friends at his new school – he has started secondary school since his adventure began – was trickier. “I was quite new to the school,” said Max. “I didn’t want to say no; I didn’t want to seem like the kid who didn’t do sleepovers. It was quite awkward.” A solution was reached. “One of them said ‘Why don’t we all sleep outside?’, so we did.” This weekend Max is taking part in a “big camp out”, having invited not only friends from north Devon but also people from around the world to sleep outside, or even make a den in their bedroom. Some may raise money, but it is also about having a communal experience. When Max wakes up on Tuesday, he will have reached the two-year mark. His mother said she was very proud. “If there’s been a problem he’s sorted himself out. He’s known he can come and wake us but he hasn’t. I think because of that he walks a bit taller. He’s solved problems and that is something he is always going to have with him.” Max said he had learned resilience. “There have been lots of nights of horrible weather – times when it’s raining or freezing – and you want to go inside but you think, ‘No, I’m out here raising money, it’s a good cause’. You’ve got to keep on fighting.”",News/UK news,Devon’s ‘boy in the tent’ heads indoors after two-year camp out,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/25/devon-boy-in-the-tent-max-woosey-heads-indoors-after-two-year-camp-out
3/25/2022,"Legal action is to be brought against all 27 EU countries over the setting of unsustainable fishing quotas for 2022, two years after a deadline to end overfishing. Under the EU’s common fisheries policy, over-exploitation of fish stocks was supposed to end in 2020 but more than 40% of all commercial stocks in EU waters were unsustainably fished last year according to official monitoring data. The green law group ClientEarth filed a request on Thursday asking the Council of the European Union to review the catch limits set by EU fisheries ministers for the north-east Atlantic in December 2021. If it is refused, the green watchdog has said it will file a case at the court of justice of the EU later this year. “We are taking legal action to stop EU ministers consistently allowing rampant overfishing,” said ClientEarth’s fisheries lawyer, Arthur Meeus. “These short-sighted policies are putting at risk the future of our fishing industry and the survival of coastal communities. “Poorly considered fisheries policy is also undermining the fragile balance of our ocean – one of the biggest carbon sinks of the planet – and its capacity to mitigate climate change. If ministers don’t follow the science and protect stocks, the price will be paid not only by fish and fishers but by all of us.” ClientEarth’s action is being filed under new access to justice rules granted last year and marks the first time that all 27 EU fisheries ministers have been legally challenged. Cod stocks are in a particularly precarious position. The North Sea has lost 80% of its cod populations since the 1970s, according to official data. Ewen Bell, the UK’s member of the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (Ices) advisory committee told the Guardian that the EU’s cod quota last year was set “just over seven percent higher than the scientific advice.” As a result, stocks are likely to fall below the “trigger point” at which stringent action should be taken to prevent depletion, he said. Cod populations in the North Sea, Irish Sea and particularly the Celtic Sea were all in a reduced state, Bell added. “In the Celtic Sea, under the current circumstances, the prognosis doesn’t look very good for that stock,” he said. The EU’s catch limits for 2022 ignored scientific advice that no cod at all should be fished from the Celtic Sea, the ocean west of Scotland and Kattegat, according to fisheries experts. “The objectives of the common fisheries policy are quite clear and they were not reached by 2020,” said another marine scientist, Lisa Borges, who has worked for the European Commission and contributed to Ices journals. “I think that many of the Tacs [total allowable catches] were set above scientific advice because of the short-term perspectives of ministers – as usual – in these negotiations,” she added. “They were under short-term pressures and there were short term costs for their industries.” European Commission and European Council officials have been approached for comment.",News/Environment,ClientEarth launches legal action against EU over unsustainable fishing quotas,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/25/clientearth-legal-action-eu-unsustainable-fishing-quotas
3/25/2022,"It’s that time of the year. Schools are winding up and hill stations are taking record bookings from people trying to beat the heat up and down the country. The king of fruit, mango, is about to make it to shelves across India, with the season just around the corner. But more than all these signs of summer, there is one unmistakable one: the start of the Indian Premier League. Since 2008, the IPL has gone from being a curiosity to a habit to Indians of different interests, different genders, different financial strata – you name it, the IPL has sucked in the population at large. In 2021, the IPL found itself in the middle of a serious controversy when the tournament was initially staged in India in the middle of the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. With hospital beds filling up, morgues operating to capacity and the medical fraternity stretched, the tournament played on for too long before public opinion turned, forcing the Board of Control for Cricket in India to suspend the tournament. It was moved to the United Arab Emirates and completed in a much tighter bio-bubble, but the damage to the administrators’ reputations was done. Despite this, the public did not change how it consumed the tournament. With large swathes of the country in different stages of lockdowns, the IPL provided respite for those who could afford it. The first 35 matches of the tournament attracted a combined viewership of 380 million, on television and via the internet. The 2022 edition is a critical one. The league needs to get its act right to ensure that any stain from the previous season is forgotten. What’s more, two new teams have been added to the mix, the Gujarat Titans and the Lucknow Super Giants. In the first season of the tournament, eight teams were sold for $723.5m, making the average cost of a team $90m. This year, the cost of two teams rose to $1.6bn. The addition of two teams also meant that a majority of the players went into a mega auction, allowing the newcomers a chance to build competitive squads after the existing teams retained a maximum of three players. As you would expect, each team had their own strategy coming into the auction. The Chennai Super Kings, who have won the IPL four times and been runners-up another five times, did all they could to buy back the core of their team and were largely successful. MS Dhoni does not play for India any longer, but he is still integral to the Chennai team, even though he stepped down from the captaincy on the eve of the tournament, handing over the reins to Ravindra Jadeja. A team that went in the opposite direction was Punjab Kings. Under the direction of Anil Kumble, they decided on a complete revamp retaining only Mayank Agarwal, who was named captain, and Arshdeep Singh. They added Shikhar Dhawan and Jonny Bairstow in the batting while breaking the bank for all-rounder Liam Livingstone. With Kagiso Rabada leading the bowling attack, Punjab has most bases covered and depth in their squad. Another team that will walk into the tournament feeling as if they achieved all they wanted at the auction is the Mumbai Indians. With more titles than any other team, Mumbai have a legacy to uphold, but it was clear that they were looking long-term in their selections. That they picked Jofra Archer, even though he will not be available, showedthey were licking their lips at the long-term prospect of Archer and Jasprit Bumrah operating in tandem. In Rohit Sharma, Mumbai have one of the most accomplished IPL leaders and batsmen and in Dewald Brevis, fast making a name for himself as Baby AB (de Villiers), they have a solid investment in the future. The Royal Challengers Bangalore also went for course correction – they have never won the IPL – in that an astute captain, Faf du Plessis, was added to a team that boasted Virat Kohli and Glenn Maxwell. This may well be the year the team goes from being glamorous big names who underperformed to coming together as a team. They have all the resources, it’s a matter of transforming that into success. This is the theme of the IPL at large this year. The BCCI has all its eggs in this basket and cannot countenance it failing, pandemic or not. Now all that’s left is for the gods to play ball.",Sport/Sport,Indian Premier League embarks on crucial season after Covid debacle | Anand Vasu,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/25/indian-premier-league-embarks-on-crucial-season-after-covid-debacle-cricket

3/25/2022,"Inspired by the case of the lighthouse keepers who vanished from their posts in the Outer Hebrides in 1900, Emma Stonex’s gripping and evocative novel is at once a locked-room mystery, a horror story and a complex psychological thriller. It opens on New Year’s Eve in 1972 as a relief crew prepares to deliver supplies by boat to The Maiden Rock, a Victorian lighthouse and “stoic bastion of seafarers’ safety” 15 nautical miles off the coast of Land’s End in Cornwall. But on arriving they find the doors are locked from the inside, the clocks have stopped at a quarter to nine and the logbook records a storm that seemingly never happened. Furthermore, the three keepers are nowhere to be found. Could they have been swept out to sea? Did they fake their own deaths? Or are more otherworldly forces at work? Fast-forward 20 years and an ambitious young writer hopes to solve the mystery of the keepers’ fate by conducting interviews with the women they left behind. The actors Indira Varma and Tom Burke each take on multiple characters in a narrative that moves back and forth across two decades. As the book plots the days leading up to the keepers’ disappearance, Burke deftly conjures the damp claustrophobia and profound isolation of life in a lighthouse at the mercy of the elements. Meanwhile Varma gives voice to the widows who appear no closer to understanding what happened to their partners, and who have each reacted to their loss in different ways.

3/25/2022,"While eating a bowl of fresh pumpkin cappellacci at Benoli in Norwich, I realised it had been about 10 years since I’d last travelled this way in search of food. That is shameful on my part, because good things are happening in this nook of East Anglia. The Assembly House, for example, one of the UK’s loveliest boutique hotels, offers a storming afternoon tea, the coffee shops around Elm Hill are fabulous, and restaurants such as Farmyard and Benedicts come highly recommended. In fact, overall, Norwich is a great place for structureless mooching, which is my favourite type of break. And then there is Benoli, a modern, three-floored Italian hidden up an alley in the city centre. I tried to look up which part of Italy Benoli was in, only to discover that it’s a combination of the names of brothers Ben and Oliver Boon, in the type of mash-up that has warmed my heart ever since my grandma’s neighbours Ron and Valerie went upmarket and named their terrace house Ronderval in the 1970s. Chef Oliver – a MasterChef: The Professionals finalist who has worked for Gordon Ramsay and was head chef at Roux at the Landau in London – recreates memories of childhood trips to Italy and Sicily, and my pumpkin pasta is the star of today’s show. It is all made by hand, rather than by machine, the pasta is soft, firm and lustrous, and the cappellacci come swimming in a rich sea of sage butter with salted ricotta. There’s no skimping on portion sizes – there can never be too much fresh, pumpkin-filled pasta, after all. Or, for that matter, too many top-quality, purple-hued winter tomatoes, cut once and drizzled in brilliant olive oil. It was a cold, foggy Wednesday night in Norwich, and dinner at Benoli was exactly what we needed. The humble-sounding “parmesan croquettes” from the snacks section of the menu turned out to be fearsome hay bales of mozzarella, potato and parmesan, deep-fried and smothered in another glut of parmesan. They looked more like furious Shredded Wheat preparing for battle than croquettes, and from the moment I set eyes on their cheesy weirdness, I knew that Benoli was no ordinary Italian restaurant. It is the safe option, for Italian restaurants outside the larger British cities, to serve a few pastas and pizzas, and tiramisu for pudding, but at Benoli there is a definite reach towards the strange and the difficult, with the likes of cod and ’nduja kiev with whipped baccalà or a spin on vitello tonnato made with veal belly, maitake mushrooms and flaky, fishy katsuobushi. The menu is hectic and helter-skelter, Japanese-influenced in places, and then – oops – we’re in eastern Europe, which is all fine by me because Boon can really cook. I’d certainly recommend the aubergine caponata, a pleasing chunk of eggplant in a light tempura batter sitting on a tomato sauce laced with furikake. I had fully intended to share this with my dining companion, but sometimes it really is the thought that counts. My friend Ainsley had the gorgonzola tortelli with cocoa, porcini and chestnut, a defiantly rich bowl of pleasure into which I poked my fork numerous times. To my credit, however, we did intentionally share a radicchio salad with a glossy, chive-emulsion dressing. If Benoli was closer to my house, I would eat here a lot. It doesn’t stand on ceremony; so little so, in fact, that you could probably turn up in your dressing gown and the delightful staff wouldn’t turn a hair, plus it’s dimly lit enough for you to get away with being secretly dressed for bed, anyway. The antipasti and pastas are great, but if you’re feeling fancy, they’ll also rustle up a halibut, chanterelles and pancetta fricassea. The pudding they made me, meanwhile, was so starkly weird that it could have come straight off the set of a MasterChef final, with a bed of softened, still-quite-tart rhubarb topped with a pale-pink, almond-butter gelato on some sort of white chocolate-based plinth scented heavily with hibiscus. Did I like this dessert? I am not sure. Did I finish this dessert? Yes, I did – I ate every mouthful, not least because I was trying to work out where the hibiscus was hidden. Was it used to steep the rhubarb? And if I don’t care for white chocolate particularly – as no grown adult really does after their Milky Bar years – why on earth was I licking the bowl? Few things give me greater pleasure than wandering out of a hotel on the hunt for dinner, expecting nothing and finding a local gem. Benoli isn’t perfect – some mouthfuls are just too much, some dishes are erratic, and if you come expecting a soothing plate of dough balls, you may be a bit disappointed – but the Boons are striving, experimenting and delivering some sort of greatness. And they’re doing it all quietly up a side street in Norwich. I won’t leave it another decade.  Benoli 5 Orford Street, Norwich, 01603 633056.

The 5p-a-litre reduction in fuel duty came into force at 6pm on Wednesday after the chancellor announced the measure in his spring statement amid the soaring cost of living. Petrol and diesel prices had hit highs of 167.3p and 179.72p a litre respectively, before Sunak’s announcement. The AA said that on Thursday the average price of petrol across the UK was 164.59p a litre, with diesel at 178.13p. “Although we have to accept that, for many forecourts, the duty cut comes through with the next delivery of fuel, the size of the fall is very disappointing,” said Luke Bosdet, the fuel price spokesman at the AA. “I expect the government will be watching very closely to see if pump prices reflect more of the fuel duty cut over the weekend.” However, Bosdet said drivers had noted that some Asda forecourts moved to drop prices even before the chancellor’s 6pm cut in fuel duty came into effect. The AA said that while the wholesale cost of diesel has been climbing, petrol has dropped “substantially” since hitting a peak at the end of the first week of March. “That should have brought a further 6p-a-litre cut in pump prices, effectively doubling the saving from the fuel duty cut,” he said. “For now, the message to drivers is clear, head to the cheaper forecourts, you can’t miss them.” While the chancellor’s spring statement offered some tax cuts, including a £3,000 increase in the threshold for national insurance contributions, it has received widespread criticism for failing to support poorer families and other vulnerable groups from soaring inflation. The New Economics Foundation said only 7% of the savings from cutting fuel duty would go to the poorest fifth of households, given that more than half do not have a car. By contrast, a third of the savings from the fuel duty cut will go to the richest fifth of households.",Lifestyle/Money,"Less than half of fuel duty cut passed on to UK drivers, says AA",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/25/less-than-half-of-fuel-duty-cut-passed-on-to-uk-drivers-says-aa
3/25/2022,"It must surely go down as one of the most dangerous rock tours in history. Svyatoslav Vakarchuk, 46, the lead singer of Okean Elzy and perhaps Ukraine’s biggest star, was supposed to be preparing to play the band’s latest album to packed venues across the world from April. Okean Elzy hold the Ukrainian record for attendance at a stadium concert, and such is Vakarchuk’s popularity at home that two in three Ukrainians wanted him to stand for president three years ago. However, a visit to a hospital in Zaporizhzhia, a city in south-eastern Ukraine, shortly after the Russian invasion has propelled Vakarchuk into a far less comfortable tour that has taken him to the frontline of the fighting, hospitals, railway station concourses filled with desperate refugees, underground platforms where civilians shelter from the bombs, and a host of recently shelled hotspots, all of it in total secrecy to avoid being targeted by Russian forces. “The first was the Zaporizhzhia three weeks ago,” said Vakarchuk, speaking during a brief stop in Lviv, a western Ukrainian city. “They wanted me to sing in front of the personnel and some, like, lightly wounded soldiers. Well, we went outside in the yard. And we were surrounded by, you know, a lot of military objects, I mean, defence things like masks, like camouflage. So it was very moving. So I sang a couple of songs. Just a cappella. Afterwards, I decided to continue it.” Since, he has sung in Odesa near the Duc de Richelieu monument commemorating the city’s founder, within firing distance of the Russian warships prowling the Black Sea, and to those sheltering in an underground station in Kharkiv, the eastern city where some of the worst shelling has been experienced. Vakarchuk, known as Slava, played on a piano outside Lviv’s central station, a 50-minute concert for the refugees, for police and for military units facing daily Russian attacks. He has turned up at universities and key workplaces to inspire them to continue through the hell. “It is just to make people feel that I am with them,” he said. “I haven’t counted I have probably sung in eight to 10 cities.” On his visit to Kharkiv, Vakarchuk said he felt echoes of the German blitz of London during the second world war as he played to those hiding away. “You can easily imagine this picture in the movies of you know, London 1941, when people were hiding in the subway during Nazi blitz and bombing,” he said. “The feeling is similar. “The nation understands that probably there is nobody else who is going to find this enemy. But even if you’re alone, you’re destined to do it and you don’t have any other choice because otherwise you’ll be ruined as a nation.” The performances, he said, were sometimes simply designed to inspire or console, while at other times it was a protest against what has engulfed the country. Vakarchuk, who keeps with him as a talisman a toy car left by his nine-month-old son, Ivan, when he was taken to safety three weeks ago, said he did worry about his safety during the tour. He said: “I am concerned. But let me tell you this. First of all, we have a small team and we do have some security there. And it’s not that I’m just alone there, no. Secondly, the point is that there is no safe place in Ukraine any more.” Vakarchuk has the rank of lieutenant in the army which allows him to travel the country. He has been invited to raise funds abroad but he said: “There is no law which allows us to leave the country for those men who can carry guns, and actually I don’t want to.” But would he shoot at a fellow soldier? “It is a very tricky question for somebody who has never done it. I don’t think there is an easy answer for that. But I’m sure that as thousands of others did, certainly I would do it as well.”",News/World news,The dangerous tour: Ukraine’s top rock star takes music to the bunkers,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/the-dangerous-tour-ukraines-top-rock-star-svyatoslav-vakarchuk-takes-music-to-the-bunkers
3/25/2022,"“You’ve got to be one of the best crowds I’ve been with,” ArrDee says, straight-faced, shirtless and dripping with sweat. He’s deadly serious, but it’s only the second night of the 19-year-old rapper’s first ever tour. ArrDee (real name Riley Davies) found rapid fame in 2021, stacking a series of UK Top 10 hits after scoring a verse on the remix to Tion Wayne and Russ Millions’ record-breaking drill hit Body. Now he’s part of a wave of rising Covid-era stars who have yet to test their skills in front of a live audience. The Brighton-born teenager starts out surprisingly stern, his brow furrowed as he barrels through Locker and its blunt bravado: “I’m a warrior, I feel like Rocky the moment he got up.” Snaking left and right, ArrDee works the front rows like a seasoned politician, shaking hands and posing for pictures. By the end of the tune he has relaxed, and breaks into a wide grin. “We gunna party or what?” he asks. On Wasted, a track with drill pioneer Digga D that samples the noughties bassline classic Heartbroken, ArrDee jumps into a new gear. Between bouncy bars about being “white-boy wasted” he demands a mosh pit from a crowd determined to oblige. Some teens do literal backflips, skidding on spilled drinks. Although the detailed storytelling of the track 6am In Brighton gets lost in the frenzy, it’s the softer cuts from his debut album Pier Pressure that confirm ArrDee’s star power. Come & Go, a track about transience and loneliness, has a brutal self-awareness that undercuts his reputation as a chatty party-starter. Sweet and sour ballad Early Hours paints the rapper as a vulnerable antihero, and he steps into the role with unflinching eye contact. His brashest hits are saved for last: Jiggy (Whiz), a loose, cold tune in which he drinks “straight from the bottle, cups are too spilly”, and Oliver Twist, ArrDee’s first solo hit that riffs on Dickens to spin a tale of ambition and greed. “I just wanted some mooooore” he yells, reaching up towards SWG3’s low ceiling. It’s only just begun, but this sold-out tour seems far too small.",Arts/Music,ArrDee review – hard-partying rapper proves he’s an artist of substance,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/25/arrdee-review-swg3-glasgow
3/25/2022,"Hello and welcome to another edition of the Guide. Gwilym is away, so this week and next I’ll be filling in with your dose of pop culture talking points, recommendations and reader picks. We begin with the news that Netflix’s hit series Selling Sunset returns for a fifth season later next month (22 April to be precise). Set in the backstabbing world of big-money real estate brokers in LA, the show has steadily become a word-of-mouth smash since it launched in 2019. Fans (myself included) rejoiced at the announcement, and the chance to finally see Jason and Chrishell’s romance (showmance?) unfold on screen. But in 2022, is reality TV less “guilty pleasure” and more “toxic trash fire”? Is it all too real? Reality TV has long run the gamut from quasi-documentaries to more structured (and scripted) series. The genre now takes in everything from Bake Off to Love Is Blind, every week bringing a new show claiming to offer a peek into someone’s dating life/workplace drama, or some kind of improbable competition (see: Netflix latest, Is It Cake?). Reality TV is everywhere, and everything – which is one of the reasons it’s increasingly in the line of fire. After all, the more ubiquitous something is, the more controversy you’re likely to find. In recent years, Love Island has become something of a bete noire for both viewers and regulators, tarnished by accusations of racism and the deaths of contestants, and former host Caroline Flack, by suicide. Earlier this month, Channel 4’s series Death on Daytime put the Jeremy Kyle Show under the microscope, using the death of a former participant to make wider points about the insalubrious culture behind the scenes of the talkshow (accusations refuted by ITV). Meanwhile, last year a study from Central Michigan University in the US found that watching reality shows that showed aggression and violence could lead to an increase in these behaviours among viewers (what is called “relational aggression”). Or not real enough? All this seems to stand in stark contrast with shows like Selling Sunset, which, though nominally about bitching and backbiting among the glamorous Oppenheim Group team, goes down as smoothly as a complimentary glass of champagne at a mega-mansion viewing. Selling Sunset got me – and many others besides – through lockdown after lockdown, in part because of how low-stakes its “high stakes” really were. For those who haven’t seen it yet, Selling Sunset is a sort-of-real-life rehash of every mean girl-themed American high school movie, mixed with a never-ending supply of house porn and presided over by identikit blond women (and a few identikit brunette women) who say “oh my god” in varying intonations, depending on the magnitude of the drama. A giant bell is rung every time the group makes a sale (poor neighbours). It is soapy, it is ridiculous and … come to think of it, maybe a little toxic. As the show’s de facto villain, Christine Quinn is presented as the root cause of much of the unrest – unrest that is, of course, integral to the format of the show, and thus to Netflix’s success. But there are plenty of other pot-stirrers in the picture, feeding information to one another in highly edited scenes that are the convention of post-2010s reality shows. Plus: they’re at work. This isn’t normal workplace behaviour we’re seeing, right?! The harsh reality Selling Sunset and its ilk – among them the many iterations of the Real Housewives franchise – probably do affect some viewers negatively. They are, largely, as shallow as a puddle, and full of bullying behaviour, which often seems more suited to a playground than an office. And yet they remain utterly compelling, facilitating the parasocial interaction that has become a convention of often lonely pandemic times. Reality TV is a deeply troubled medium, and one that is undergoing something of a reckoning (see the podcast Harsh Reality, about the misguided reality series There’s Something About Miriam, which antagonised its trans participant). However, it’s important to make a distinction between the reality shows that truly harm us and the ones that are merely uncanny versions of the mad world we already live in. In the age of TikTok and Insta ubiquity, we’re all reality stars to some degree. At least on Selling Sunset, unlike in real life, there’s someone standing just out of shot waiting to shout “cut” before the messiest drama begins. WATCH We might have bid farewell to the Duke – AKA Regé-Jean Page – but Bridgerton carries on unabated. Binge season two of Netflix’s Regency extravaganza now – or just wait for the inevitable memes.

3/25/2022,"Without seeming as if he’s trying too hard to be new or different, choreographer Kyle Abraham fills the stage with dance that feels effortlessly fresh. The American draws on movement from ballet, contemporary dance, hip-hop and everyday life to create work that connects with the world outside the theatre. In work for his own company, AIM, Abrahams has dwelt on subject matter from street violence to the American prison system. The Weathering, his first big piece for the Royal Ballet (he made a short, Optional Family, last year) is informed by the idea of losing the people we love, but it comes in the form of glowing remembrance, transported to youthful energy and hopeful connections, opening to Ryan Lott’s score sounding like twittering spring birds. There’s a looseness in the torsos that means when dancers move they seem like real people, even though the choreography also delights in ballet’s virtuosity: jumps full of crisscrossing beats, high-velocity turns. There is exuberant life and tender duets, especially one for Joseph Sissens and Calvin Richardson, which opens with them touching foreheads in arabesque. The stage is bathed in shades of rose gold, each lighting change (by Dan Scully) a small revelation. Only in a subtly moving final solo does the sense of loss arrive; glowing lamps descend from the ceiling, perhaps one light for every person missed. This triple bill showcases the chameleon-esque abilities of the modern ballet dancer. Crystal Pite’s Solo Echo was made for Nederlands Dans Theater, but the seven dancers here fully embody its exclamatory style and tensile urgency, especially Luca Acri in the central role, always an expressive and explosive mover. Compared with Abraham’s freshness, the crisp neoclassicism of Christopher Wheeldon’s DGV: Danse à Grande Vitesse looks very 2006 (when it was made): it’s all about the display of long-limbed extensions and finely engineered bodies. With Michael Nyman’s propulsive minimalism as backdrop, it’s easy to let it all wash over you, but a couple of dancers shake things up: Sissens tearing on to the stage with gusto, and William Bracewell turning his pas de deux into a game and teasing the superpoised Yasmine Naghdi to let her guard down.

3/25/2022,"It is one of the most famous scenes in British television history: Colin Firth’s Mr Darcy emerges dripping from a lake to bump into Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, a significant turning point in their relationship. From Saturday, fans will be able to get a closeup view of the white shirt that Firth wore for the moment in the 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. The shirt is the centrepiece of an exhibition opening at Jane Austen’s House in Chawton, Hampshire. Jane Austen Undressed focuses largely on the undergarments that Austen heroines would have worn under their Regency dresses, but one of the main draws is bound to be the Firth shirt. The curator Sophie Reynolds said she was sure Austen fans would be thrilled to see the shirt, which has spent most of the years since in the hands of a professional costume company. “I think people will be excited to see it in the flesh and hopefully no one will go up and hug it,” she said. “As a thirtysomething I am excited, I have to say. Most women of my generation seem to be Pride and Prejudice fans. The BBC version really has converted a whole generation, especially young women, to Jane Austen. “It was the way I came to know her – I was 11 when it came out. I hadn’t really heard of her but I watched it and it was a lightbulb moment. I’ve heard this story from so many of my friends – we were absolutely hooked.” Reynolds said the BBC show was a “comfort blanket” for many people. “I think it hasn’t aged in the way that most costume dramas have.” The shirt was “simple” but completely memorable, she said. The famous scene was fabricated by the show’s adaptor, Andrew Davies, and does not appear in the novel, which Reynolds accepted horrified some Austen purists. Firth has said the role was a mixed blessing. “Looking good and strutting around is very boring,” he said in 2020. But Reynolds argued that the scene worked well, communicating Darcy’s character development, a metaphorical shedding of his formal layers, his seriousness, his self-importance. Stripping Darcy down to his shirt was the 21st-century equivalent of removing his clothes down to his underwear, making it a revealing moment literally and figuratively. The exhibition features other famous underclothing such as a petticoat Ehle wore in the BBC show, and stays worn by Anya Taylor-Joy’s Emma Woodhouse in the 2020 film Emma.

There are no direct trains to London from Manchester and Merseyside that weekend because of engineering works and the mayors of Greater Manchester and Liverpool had joined fans in calling for the match to be moved.

3/25/2022,"By all accounts, the Faroe Islands are the perfect place to live. The air is clean, the population is sparse and – judging by the local newspaper, which currently has the reopening of a hotel as a top story – it is free of the relentless doom-mongering that batters the rest of us. I would be very happy living on the Faroe Islands. So would you. Unless, that is, you haven’t seen No Time to Die. Even though No Time to Die has been out for some time, and realistically everybody who wanted to watch it should have done, the film’s ending is still the subject of collectively agreed secrecy. If you haven’t seen the film, stop reading now. Not that it matters, because some Faroe Islanders have spoiled the ending in the most elaborate way possible: they have erected a gravestone where James Bond died. This is no halfhearted effort. The grave was cut from Faroese basalt by an acclaimed stonemason from the village of Skopun and designed to resemble the gravestones of 007’s parents. Engraved on the stone are the words read by M at the close of No Time to Die: “The proper function of a man is to live, not to exist.” You could argue that the Faroese have the right to situate James Bond’s grave there because, well, that’s where he died. The climactic scene of No Time to Die, in which Bond gets blown to smithereens by missiles was filmed in the tiny village of Trøllanes, population 26. True, the location was substantially altered in post-production, with all the charming homes and lighthouses scrubbed out in favour of a brutalist industrial poison farm, but it’s still where he died. Then again, you can’t help but feel that it undoes quite a lot of everyone’s hard work. For months, any and all discussions of No Time to Die have been accompanied by a panicky fear of spoiling the ending. We check and double check whether the person we are talking to has seen it. We shoot furtive glances to make sure we won’t be overheard by a passing stranger. We have all tacitly taken on the responsibility to keep schtum. Now there’s a tourist attraction dedicated giving it away. It is not impossible that a hiker, who has spent their entire holiday looking forward to watching No Time to Die on the plane home, will take a wrong turn near Trøllanes and trip over a spoiler that has literally been carved in stone. This didn’t happen to other films. There is no plaque in Philadelphia saying: “This is where the kid from The Sixth Sense first saw a dead person.” There isn’t a statue on a beach in New York stating that the Planet of the Apes was Earth all along. These things are kept secret for a reason. And is this the level of tourism that the Faroe Islands wants? The Guardian offices are near Kings Cross, where there is a small commemorative Harry Potter attraction. On our way to work, we have to zigzag past loads of adults in scarves taking selfies while they pretend to run through a wall. Now the Faroe Islands are inviting a similar type of tourist.

3/25/2022,"The Royal Court theatre in London is to present a day of solidarity with Ukraine that includes a reading on its main stage of Natal’ya Vorozhbit’s play Bad Roads, which explores the brutal effects of war on personal relationships. The reading, on 1 April, will be livestreamed on the Guardian website too and available to watch for a week. Upstairs at the theatre, as part of the In Solidarity day, there will also be readings of 10 short plays about the conflict by members of Ukraine’s Theater of Playwrights collective, which opened its Kyiv venue in December 2021 but soon had to temporarily close amid Russia’s invasion. Bad Roads was staged at the Royal Court in 2017 in a translation by Sasha Dugdale. Vorozhbit, an acclaimed Ukrainian playwright whose work has also been performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company, wove documentary stories of Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea and Donbas into its impressionistic scenes. Bad Roads explores daily life under siege, hostage-taking, journalism on the frontline, PTSD and sex at a time of war. Vorozhbit’s previous plays include a verbatim-style drama resulting from testimonies she took from protesters at the Ukrainian capital Kyiv’s Maidan square in 2013 and 2014. At a time of fake news, her commitment to oral history in drama has had a “vital importance in the information war” wrote Dugdale for the Guardian in 2017. “By stressing the sexual and the female in her study of war, Natal’ya haunts us all with the power of conflict to warp modern society,” added Dugdale. “War, as she explained [in rehearsals for Bad Roads in 2017], returns us to the most intense feelings of hate and love.” The Royal Court’s artistic director, Vicky Featherstone, who staged the original production, will direct the reading. The event marks the first major UK presentation of Ukrainian plays since Russia’s invasion began in February. Ticket buyers and those watching the free Bad Roads stream will also be invited to donate to Unicef UK’s fundraising appeal to protect children in Ukraine. Ticket revenue will contribute towards supporting the Ukrainian artists involved in the event. On the War, the readings in the theatre upstairs, are personal accounts of the war from 10 members of Kyiv’s Theater of Playwrights: Oles Barleeg, Natalia Blok, Andrii Bondarenko, Oleksii Dorychevskyi, Julia Gonchar, Anastasiia Kosodii, Lena Lagushonkova, Olha Matsyupa, Oksana Savchenko and Liudmyla Tymoshenko.
