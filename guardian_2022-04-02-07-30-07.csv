4/2/2022,"Ghislaine Maxwell’s bid for a new trial has been denied, the judge in her Manhattan federal court sex-trafficking case said on Friday. The daughter of the late British media baron Robert Maxwell repeatedly requested a new trial after a juror in the case failed to disclose childhood sexual abuse during jury selection. Juror No 50, Scotty David, was questioned in court on 8 March about his omission. He told the judge, Alison Nathan, he had been distracted when quickly completing a screening questionnaire. In her ruling on Friday, Nathan said she thought David’s explanation was truthful and he gave no indication of bias against Maxwell. “The court finds Juror 50 testified credibly at the hearing,” Nathan wrote in a 40-page decision. “There are many reasons for that finding. He appeared to testify frankly and honestly, even when the answers he gave were the cause of personal embarrassment and regret. His incentive at the hearing was to testify truthfully or face criminal perjury charges.” Nathan added: “His tone, demeanor and responsiveness gave no indication of false testimony. The court thus credits his testimony that he was distracted as he filled out the questionnaire and ‘skimmed way too fast’, leading him to misunderstand some of the questions. “The court further finds that Juror 50 was not biased and would not have been stricken for cause even if he had answered each question on the questionnaire accurately.” David told Nathan his failure to mention childhood sexual abuse was an “honest mistake” and he was deeply remorseful. He was given immunity to testify, having indicated he would invoke his fifth-amendment right against self-incrimination. Maxwell was found guilty on 29 December of sex-trafficking and related charges for bringing girls, some aged just 14, to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, for him to sexually abuse. Maxwell insists she is innocent. Epstein, a convicted sex offender whose high-profile associates once included Prince Andrew, was arrested in July 2019, on sex-trafficking charges. He killed himself in federal jail in New York. Following Maxwell’s trial, David gave interviews in which he discussed experiencing sexual abuse as a child. He claimed he had told the jury about this so they could understand things from a victim’s perspective. David’s comments prompted questions because would-be jurors were asked about any history of abuse during selection proceedings. The questionnaire asked, for example: “Have you or a friend ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse or sexual assault?” When David’s comments were revealed, prosecutors requested Nathan investigate. Maxwell’s lawyers made a similar request and then asked Nathan for a new trial. Prosecutors argued against a new trial, noting David’s adamance that he did not fail to reveal his abuse intentionally. “After the thoughtful and thorough hearing held by this court, it is crystal clear that the defendant received a fair trial,” prosecutors said in court papers. “Juror 50’s sworn testimony at the hearing made evident that he did not deliberately lie in completing the questionnaire, but that he instead made an honest mistake.” In her decision on Friday, Nathan also addressed the contention of Maxwell’s attorneys that they would have tried to keep David off the jury had they known his history. The judge said that was not pertinent to weighing Maxwell’s push for a new trial. “What is not at issue in resolving this motion is whether the defendant would have exercised a peremptory strike against this juror had he accurately disclosed his prior sexual abuse,” Nathan wrote. “Although the defendant argues in her pre-hearing briefing that she is also entitled to a new trial because Juror 50’s failure to disclose his history denied her the opportunity to exercise her peremptory challenges, that is not the law in federal court.”",News/US news,"Ghislaine Maxwell’s bid for new trial denied, judge rules",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/01/ghislaine-maxwell-retrial-bid-denied-judge
4/2/2022,"Ralf Rangnick has dismissed Louis van Gaal’s criticism that Manchester United are a “commercial club” by pointing out that despite holding this opinion the Dutchman signed a contract to be manager in 2014. Van Gaal’s comments came when discussing the candidacy of Erik ten Hag, the Ajax manager, who is on the shortlist to be United’s No 1 when Rangnick’s interim management ends in May. Van Gaal, who led United for two years, warned his compatriot to go to a “football club” rather than to Old Trafford. “Louis himself as an experienced coach signed a contract here some years ago and he could have known that in advance if he had that opinion,” Rangnick said. “Football worldwide is a commercialised business that’s for sure.” United’s spend under Van Gaal was more than £315m, part of a total £1.1bn outlay in the nine seasons since they were last champions. Rangnick stated that this was a benefit of commercial viability. “It’s always good if you have money available to sign players,” he said. Rangnick did partly agree with Gary Neville, the former United captain and now Sky Sports pundit, who accused Rangnick, United players, and members of the executive of being “tone deaf” after they posted on social media and travelled to different global locations after being knocked out of the Champions League by Atlético Madrid on 15 March. The defeat came four days before the Premier League matches and FA Cup quarter-finals that led into the international break, with United not involved in either. “The situation was a particular one: we had two and a half weeks until the next game after Atlético [Leicester City on Saturday at home] including an international break, which meant we only had six or seven players for training,” Rangnick said. “I don’t think it would have made sense [to train], although maybe for public perception it might have made sense to show we’re training every day with five or six on-field players.” He conceded it was a corollary of United having only Champions League qualification to compete for. “Hopefully we will [again] never be in a situation where we have no competitive game for two and a half weeks,” said Rangnick. Harry Maguire is preparing to play for United for the first time since his substitution against Atlético was cheered by a section of fans and he was booed by England supporters at Wembley. Rangnick says Maguire draws criticism on social media from United fans because he is compared with former players. “Maybe it’s still got to do with the high expectations around this club and how people tend to compare with former players and legends,” he said. Questioned about booing by England fans, and seemingly ignoring the incident against Atlético, he added: “I’m pretty sure it won’t happen in our stadium.” Rangnick dismissed Paul Pogba’s complaint that having to play recently in a wide berth instead of his usual midfield position is difficult, the Frenchman contrasting this with how he is fielded in his preferred role consistently for his country. “Since the game against West Ham [in January] we have lost three strikers: Anthony Martial, Mason Greenwood and [the injured] Edinson Cavani: so you have to play in a different role,” said Rangnick.",Sport/Football,Manchester United’s Rangnick hits back at Van Gaal’s ‘commercial club’ jibe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/01/manchester-uniteds-rangnick-hits-back-at-van-gaals-commercial-club-jibe
4/2/2022,"Frank Lampard says Dele Alli has a point to prove at Everton and insists the midfielder’s appetite for the game is not in question. The 25-year-old has not started for Lampard’s relegation-threatened team since his deadline-day move from Tottenham, making six appearances from the bench. Alli’s minimal impact, after the sharp decline in his Spurs career, prompted Stan Collymore to suggest the former England international should considering retiring if he has lost hunger. Lampard has taken issue with Collymore’s criticism but accepts Alli needs to prove his detractors wrong over the final two months of the season. The Everton manager said: “I saw those comments and it is important to broach them because I know Stan a little bit and he had difficulties which he has been open about in his career. I understand where he is coming from on his own front, but to speak about someone you do not know or put them in the same bracket was a bit much. “From my point of view I have the familiarity of working with Dele every day and I do not see a player who wants to retire at that age. That is a strong comment. What I do see – and people can put it that way – is he has a lot to prove. The basics are that when you have a lot to prove you have to get your head down, listen and prove people wrong on the pitch. That starts on the training pitch.” Lampard says Everton’s desperate need to pull clear of the relegation zone, combined with Alli’s lack of match sharpness when he arrived, has complicated the midfielder’s start. “People were talking about Dele as one of the top young players in the world, let’s be honest,” he said. “He has been eligible to play seven league games. I always believed it would take some time. We are in a situation now where every game we go into, my selection thought is this has to be the best team possible to win this game. Dele has to train and show he is in that thinking, and every time he comes on he has to show he is worthy of starting a game. “I am not saying he has not done that. Some players say they are better when they start. I said that as a player. The reality from my side of the fence is you work on the individual. I am seeing him work and when the time is right and I feel he is there and will help the team, he will do it. He is the same as every other player when it comes to that.” Lampard is considering including the 18-year-old Isaac Price in his squad for Sunday’s visit to West Ham.

4/2/2022,"Jürgen Klopp has described the Football Association’s decision to stage the FA Cup semi-finals when there are no direct trains to London from Liverpool or Manchester as “one of the most ridiculous stories I ever heard”. The Liverpool manager joined condemnation of the travel arrangements for his team’s semi-final against Manchester City at Wembley on 16 April, when engineering works planned since November 2019 will cause major disruption on the west-coast mainline. The FA will charter 200 free buses to take Liverpool and City fans to and from the game but the measure has not lessened Klopp’s incredulity. Supporter groups from Liverpool and City have been highly critical of the FA’s schedule and Klopp said: “It is one of the most ridiculous stories I ever heard. I heard that they knew about the works for 18 months and I’m not sure what the FA thought; that no club from the north-west could be part of the semi-finals? I really can’t believe that things like this can happen with all of the information you have out there. I heard now that the FA or whoever are putting some coaches on the road. What is it, usually four and a half hours to London? It will probably then be 12 with both sets of supporters coming from the same direction. It makes absolutely no sense.” Network Rail notified the FA of the engineering works 17 months ago and reminded the governing body of the disruption in September. The FA, which has avoided scheduling semi-finals over the Easter weekend for several years, says midweek matches in Uefa competitions and engineering works also planned for 9-10 and 23-24 April made the selected weekend the most suitable in a congested calendar. But Klopp said: “I’m not sure when they had to decide when the semi-finals would be but I think there is another weekend between the Champions League games [they could have chosen]. It would have been our City game [on 10 April]. That would have been funny, moving the City game for a City game, but at least on that weekend all fans could have gone to Wembley without making it more difficult for them. How I know our people, they will find a way, but I’m just not happy that somebody made it so complicated. It should be easier to see your football team in a semi-final than the ways they have chosen.” Trent Alexander-Arnold, meanwhile, resumed full training on Friday after a hamstring injury and could be included in Klopp’s squad for Saturday’s Premier League home game against Watford. The influential full-back was expected to be out until next weekend’s visit to the Etihad Stadium.",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp hits out at ‘ridiculous’ FA over semi-final arrangements,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/01/jurgen-klopp-hits-out-at-ridiculous-fa-over-semi-final-arrangements
4/2/2022,"Pep Guardiola believes Erik ten Hag could be the right manager to eventually succeed him at Manchester City but insists there are no guarantees the Dutchman would be a success in the Premier League if he joins Manchester United. The Ajax manager is on United’s shortlist to take over at Old Trafford next season and said on Friday when asked whether he could leave this summer: “You never know.” Guardiola worked with Ten Hag at Bayern Munich for two seasons when he was in charge of the German club’s second team and described him as “an incredible person”, adding that “his Ajax teams are a joy to watch”. But City’s manager, asked whether Ten Hag would be assured of translating his success in the Netherlands to English football, said: “If I was 100% I would call Manchester United and tell them: ‘Guys, you have to take him.’ But nobody knows. When I arrived here I didn’t know. He’s a good manager, there is no doubt. But there were good managers there in the past since Sir Alex [Ferguson] left. You cannot say that David Moyes is not a good manager or Louis van Gaal or José Mourinho. I think all the managers that have been at United have been excellent.” Guardiola is in his sixth year at City and has a deal until the end of next season. He has said he may decide in the summer whether to sign an extension but endorsed Ten Hag as a strong candidate to take over when he steps away. “Could Erik ten Hag be here at City? Definitely. I think he could be the one,” Guardiola said. “For the way he approaches the game.” He joked: “I will say to [director of football] Txiki [Begiristain] now.” Ten Hag said on Friday that he could not rule out leaving Amsterdam this summer. “My focus is currently only on Ajax,” he said. “But in football you never know.” Asked to confirm or deny speaking to United, Ten Hag said: “Everyone knows each other in the industry. There are always talks with representatives from other clubs – that’s normal.” Guardiola revealed that City would be without Rúben Dias for their Premier League game at home to Liverpool next Sunday as the defender continues to recover from a hamstring injury but John Stones is fit to face Burnley on Saturday after returning home early from England duty. “We will not risk him,” Guardiola said of Dias. “The most important thing is I will not ask a player to play when he is not ready.”",Sport/Football,Pep Guardiola says Erik ten Hag could succeed him at Manchester City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/01/pep-guardiola-says-erik-ten-hag-could-succeed-him-at-manchester-city
4/2/2022,"For Gareth Southgate, the moment of jeopardy at the World Cup draw came when Lothar Matthäus reached for the second ball from pot two. England were already installed in Group B and everybody knew that the former Germany captain could pull out his own nation to make things pretty spicy. Southgate had to feel scrambled. His mid-afternoon flight from Heathrow on Thursday had been delayed by eight hours, which meant he landed in Doha at 8.30am on Friday, “which was fine because my first meeting wasn’t until nine o’clock,” the England manager said with a smile. Now he could feel a note of real tension. And then it passed because Matthäus unfurled a slip bearing the name of the United States. Shortly afterwards, the 1990 World Cup winner put Germany in with Spain and, if the Germany manager, Hansi Flick, tried to look impassive from his seat at the Doha Exhibition and Convention Centre, it was certainly a bit of a battle. Danke, Lothar. Southgate was on the way to another favourable draw, the impression hardening when Iran were revealed as England’s third opponents. The fourth will be Wales, Scotland or Ukraine, depending on what happens in the final European playoff, which is slated for June, although everybody’s thoughts are primarily for an end to Russia’s senseless offensive on Ukraine. “That game is going to be highly emotional, whoever it is,” Southgate said. “We all know where our thoughts are with Ukraine and we have to see whether they are even able to play or not. And, of course, if it’s one of the British teams we’ve been through that in tournaments recently. They become unique games. Form is totally out of the window.” Spain and Germany are in with Japan. Argentina, Mexico and Poland will contest Group C. And there is danger in Group H, which features Brazil, Switzerland, Serbia and Cameroon. At the very least, Southgate knew that it could have been an awful lot worse, even if his team had driven a part of their luck by getting themselves into the top pot of seeds – a legacy of their runs to the semi-finals of the previous World Cup and the final of Euro 2020. For those tournaments, Southgate’s team had been given good group phase draws before the latter stages opened up for them. The third time is the charm. “It’s intriguing, isn’t it?” Southgate said. “Because we’ve never played Iran and then the States … I’ve met Gregg Berhalter [the USA manager] a lot recently so we’ve had some good chats and he’s got them vastly improved. This is one of those groups where you’re thinking that some of the ties are potentially trickier than just the rankings. That’s always a danger.” The England defender, Kyle Walker, was a little more forthright in his assessment. “You’ve got to be happy with the teams we’ve drawn,” Walker said, back in England. “Hopefully it’s not going to bring any surprises. I’m happy with the teams.” It was lost on nobody that the draw had taken place on April Fool’s Day, what with all of the issues surrounding Qatar’s hosting. And the ceremony certainly took a surreal turn early on when, under migraine-inducing ultra-violet lights, the official mascot was revealed – a small, floating, white-robbed ghost. La’eeb (an Arabic word meaning super-skilled player) inhabits a parallel, virtual world, where the previous tournament mascots also live. The big screens showed La’eeb travelling there with a virtual version of RedOne, the Fifa creative entertainment executive. There was polite applause at the end of the section. Southgate’s headache involves the tight turnaround between the pause to the Premier League season on 13 November and England’s opening tie against Iran, which will be on the opening day of the tournament – 21 November, although Walker again took a positive line. “Over the last two years, we’ve come to adapt to playing every three days,” Walker said. “Going to the World Cup a week after the last Premier League game works in our favour. We’ve still got the rhythm. We know each other very well so it should not be a problem.” Southgate said that Fifa rules dictated the teams had to be in Qatar five days before their first tie so it probably made sense to fly “reasonably early” because “we know that you can’t do a lot for the first couple of days” after the league finishes. “The players are still recovering,” he added. “So we could get all that out of the way … otherwise you’re losing two days of training, potentially, [at the other end]. We’ll be pretty much into checking up on the injuries and fitness – that will be key. Is it a problem? Well, it would have only been one or two days different if we were starting later. We’ve known that we have to be really well organised on that. It might mean you could have a few players ruled out of the first game for that reason.” Southgate confirmed that he would lobby the Premier League not to stage massive games on the weekend of 12-13 November. “We’ve been having those conversations quietly in the background,” he said. “I’m sure if they can help, they’ll try to help.” Berhalter, whose young and athletic US team are ranked 15th in the world, said he had contacted Southgate after he got the job as the manager in December 2018. It was a time when the nation was reeling after the failure to qualify for the Russia World Cup. Previously they had made seven straight appearances at the tournament. “I reached out to Gareth because of the similarities,” Berhalter said. “I was taking over a young team and I’d seen what he had done. There was always a bit of difficulty in playing for England and they were at a difficult point [when Southgate took over]. He changed the culture. England will be the favourites for most of the games but we understand that. My players are fearless. They do not look back.”",Sport/Football,England’s Gareth Southgate warns of dangers in ‘intriguing’ World Cup draw,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/01/englands-gareth-southgate-warns-of-dangers-in-intriguing-world-cup-draw
