2/1/2022,"Anthony Pratt’s Pratt Holdings was the biggest political donor in the last year, tipping $1.3m into Liberal party coffers ahead of the 2022 election. The Australian Electoral Commission released disclosures for the 2020-21 financial year on Tuesday, revealing significant donations to upstart political movements including $1m to conservative lobby group Advance Australia and $300,000 to Rodney Culleton’s Great Australia party.  In total, the Liberal party and its branches declared $74m in receipts, including $4.8m in donations, with the rest made up of “other receipts” such as fees for business forums, intra-party transfers and public funding. Labor declared $67m in total including $8.2m in donations. The Greens declared $16m and the Nationals $9m, with donations to both totalling about $655,000. Pratt Holdings gave $1,288,000 to the Liberal party’s various divisions, dwarfing its donation of just $10,000 to NSW Labor. Pratt, the billionaire box maker, hosted a rally fronted by Donald Trump at one of his US companies in Ohio, attended by Scott Morrison during his 2019 US visit. Meriton Property Services gave $285,000 to the Liberal party, with some $200,000 going to the NSW Liberal party. Donations tend to ramp up in the months before a federal election, meaning returns for 2020-21 were lower than the bumper year of 2018-19 which included Mineralogy’s $83m donation to the United Australia party. The AEC returns revealed Advance Australia received $650,000 from Silver River Investment Holdings and $350,000 from Cartwright Investment Corp, controlled by Simon and Elizabeth Fenwick. Simon Fenwick, a former fund manager, had previously announced his intention to give the group $1m due to his concerns “Australia’s freedom, prosperity and security is being undermined by left-wing agendas and that a strong counter-voice is needed”. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, he reportedly cited “dictatorial politicians like Victoria’s Daniel Andrews” as the impetus for the gift. William Nitschke gave $300,000 to the Great Australia party, former One Nation senator Culleton’s new political party which campaigns on an anti-vaccine mandate platform.

Many of the largest donors had an each ways bet, giving roughly equal donations to the major parties. The National Automotive Leasing and Salary Packaging Association gave Labor and Liberal $150,000 each; the Pharmacy Guild of Australia gave $295,000 roughly evenly split between Labor and Liberal branches, and the Australian Hotels Association of NSW gave $260,000 in total to the Liberals, Nationals and Labor.

Empire has been the main beneficiary of a federal program designed to incentivise fracking and gas exploration in the Beetaloo Basin, receiving $21m in three grants announced in July last year. The Greens senator Larissa Waters noted that Santos, another company seeking to frack the Beetaloo, had donated to both sides of politics. Santos, who also want public handouts to frack the Beetaloo, gave $22k to the Nats and $44k to Labor. (Coincidental reminder: Labor and Coalition both voted to keep pouring public money into fracking the Beetaloo, in a climate crisis, against First Nations’ wishes) #auspol Other ming and energy companies prominent in the list of donors included: Woodside Energy, which gave $232,000 to the Liberals, Nationals and Labor. Mineral Resources, which gave $222,400 to the Liberals, Nationals and Labor in Western Australia. The Trustee for St Baker Family Trust, which gave $165,000 to the two major parties, including the LNP in Queensland. Sally Zhou’s Aus Gold Mining Group, which gave the Liberals $77,777. Duncan Turpie, a professional gambler and maths genius, gave $110,000 to the Greens, including their Queensland and Tasmanian branches. Other big donations by individuals included: Scott Edwardes, a lawyer and WA Liberal candidate at the state election, who gave $224,000 to the party; and miner and tech investor Charles Bass, who gave $216,000 to the major parties in WA. According to the Centre for Public Integrity, donations from the 10 biggest donors made up about one-quarter ($4.2m) of the $17.9m received in 2020-21. The centre’s chair, Anthony Whealy, said: “The commonwealth has the weakest donation laws in the country. “Today we can see some of the donations that were made last financial year, but nothing under $14,500 and nothing from the last six months.” Whealy said the disclosure scheme is “mis-named – it is a non-disclosure scheme with more than a third of political funding shrouded in secrecy”. “With an election around the corner, the public deserves to know who is funding our political parties.” Guardian Australia analysis of AEC data shows at least $67.2m received by the major parties is so-called “dark money” – funds for which the source is not made public. Political parties are required to declare the total amount of money they receive in a financial year, and then must make more detailed declarations for donations and sums of money that fit certain criteria. Amounts received under the donation threshold of $14,300 in 2020-21 were not required to be listed by parties, though some do so voluntarily. This means the source of millions of dollars in funding is never declared.",News/Australia news,Anthony Pratt gave Liberals $1.3m while upstart political groups gain sizeable donations,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/01/anthony-pratt-gave-liberals-13m-while-upstart-political-groups-gain-sizeable-donations
2/1/2022,"The Liberals’ preferred candidate to contest the federal seat of Warringah, barrister Jane Buncle, has withdrawn her nomination, leaving a right-aligned candidate described by one senior Liberal as “Tony Abbott 2.0” to attempt to wrest back the Sydney seat from independent Zali Steggall. Buncle, widely believed to enjoy the majority support of local rank-and-file members as well as the moderate faction, wrote to the New South Wales Liberal director Chris Stone to withdraw on Monday after the division again failed to resolve its impasse on preselections.  A rising star of the NSW bar, Buncle is said to have expressed concerns that without time to campaign she faced an uphill battle to win the northern beaches seat, which Steggall holds with margin of 7.2% after defeating Abbott in 2019. Only one other nominated candidate remains. He is Lincoln Parker, a defence analyst, who is backed by the right faction. Parker, a member of the Manly branch, has appeared on Sky News and written for the rightwing Falun Gong-backed newspaper the Epoch Times. He is also chair of the Liberal party’s defence and national security policy branch. “He’s Tony Abbott 2.0. It’s completely the wrong look for the seat,” said one senior Liberal. The NSW Liberal party is facing an ongoing crisis with eight key seats without candidates, just three months out from the federal election in May. Despite nominations closing in May 2021, the NSW division has not held preselections or vetted candidates because of factional manoeuvring. Two other candidates are also reported to have withdrawn their candidacies in the NSW central coast seat of Dobell: Pentecostal preacher Jemima Gleeson – the prime minister Scott Morrison’s pick – and cricketer Nathan Bracken. Labor holds the seat by just 1.5%, making it one of the Liberals’ most prospective. Several other candidates had withdrawn from seeking preselection in Warringah in recent months as Morrison sought to entice a high-profile person, including former premiers Mike Baird and Gladys Berejiklian, to run. But none could be found and this left Buncle the obvious frontrunner with the numbers. But a failure to hold a plebiscite has left Buncle with only a limited time to campaign, and she is understood to have indicated that this made the task impossible. Although it may be possible to reopen preselections, the move would be difficult and would require a rock star candidate to be put forward to gain the 90% support on the deeply divided state executive. The move means Steggall now looks likely to hold the seat with the same or increased margin, local Liberals said. In Dobell, the remaining candidate is cardiologist Dr Michael Feneley, who has previously run as the Liberal candidate in Kingsford Smith. He is supported by the right and the moderates. Attempts to endorse two ministers, Sussan Ley and Alex Hawke, and one sitting member, Trent Zimmerman, without a competitive preselection failed on Monday. It was a direct rejection of attempts by the prime minister’s office to at least solve part of the problem. However, it would have weakened the right’s bargaining power and was rejected by both the moderates and the right. A complicated, more comprehensive deal on the remaining eight seats remains on the table. It could be put to a vote later this week, but requires 90% support by the 27-member executive. One insider said the chances of federal intervention were now 50/50. This would involve the branch effectively being dissolved and the federal office taking over the affairs of the NSW division. This would almost certainly prompt a legal challenge from some members who are angered about the delays and the plan to parachute candidates into some branches and ignore the party’s new rules which give all branch members the right to participate in a plebiscite.",News/Australia news,"Leading Liberal candidate Jane Buncle quits Warringah race, leaving ‘Tony Abbott 2.0’ to contest seat",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/01/leading-liberal-candidate-jane-buncle-quits-warringah-race-leaving-tony-abbott-20-to-contest-seat
