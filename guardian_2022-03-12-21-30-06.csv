3/12/2022,"Aparanoid Russian ruler plunges into a disastrous war. Inept tactics lead to an appalling death toll. The confused ordinary people are kept in the dark. It’s all horribly familiar. English Touring Opera’s decision to take Rimsky-Korsakov’s sharply satirical The Golden Cockerel around the country this spring seems in equal measure to be both inspired and wincingly inappropriate. Witnessing the cartoonish deaths of young soldiers on stage feels uncomfortably crass when real guns are raging, yet when the deluded ruler declares “I’ll not listen to advice, not even to my own” it really hits home. Ridicule is the weapon despots fear most. For that reason alone this opera would not stand a chance of being staged in Moscow today. Rimsky never saw it performed. Revolution was in the air, fuelled by the cruel suppression of dissent after the 1905 uprising and Russia’s defeat in the tsar’s ill-judged war against the Japanese. A piece that made fun of an indolent ruler and his doltish family was always going to clash with the censors and it wasn’t staged until 1909, after Rimsky’s death. James Conway’s production – dedicated on first night to the people of Ukraine and brave protesters in Russia – takes a suitably pantomime approach, with comic-book characters decked out in Neil Irish’s primary-coloured costumes singing a rumpty-tumpty rhyming translation by Antal Doráti and James Gibson. King Dodon, who would rather sleep than rule, fears a neighbouring state will overwhelm his country. An astrologer offers him a golden cockerel who will warn if the enemy advances. Delighted, the king offers the astrologer any reward he cares to name. He choses an IOU, which he will later redeem with devastating consequences. The cockerel crows, war ensues and many die, including the king’s two sons, who kill each other in confusion. The first act takes a while to settle, with clumsy silliness getting in the way of the satire, not least from sons Prince Guidon and Prince Aphron (tenor Thomas Elwin and baritone Jerome Knox), though bass Grant Doyle, as the hopeless yet dangerous king, has huge fun with his knockabout role, lolling on his bed-like throne being spoon-fed by his adoring nanny Amelfa (mezzo Amy J Payne, in menacing form). Things pick up in the second half, when we discover that Dodon’s foes are led by the alluring Queen of Shemakha. Soprano Paula Sides looks magnificent in peacock headdress and emerald gown, as imperious as the Queen of the Night. And Rimsky gives her his most interesting music, sinuous eastern melodies curling and twisting in the manner of his most popular work, Scheherazade. There were a few intonation problems on first night, the delicacy of Iain Farrington’s admirable reduced score, conducted by Gerry Cornelius, perhaps too frail at times to support her, but her commanding presence and the warmth of her coloratura were never in doubt. There is also some extraordinary singing from tenor Robert Lewis, as the Astrologer, who tackles his uncomfortably high vocal line with ease. Bright soprano Alys Mererid Roberts, resplendent as the strutting Cockerel, has the final say, pecking the dreadful Russian ruler to death. Now there’s an idea. More birds – and animals – were conjured at the Barbican last week when the arts centre celebrated its 40th birthday with two performances of Haydn’s gloriously ebullient oratorio, The Creation. The London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, resident at the Barbican since its opening, should have been conducted by Simon Rattle, but a minor operation prevented him appearing. His place was taken by the coolly reliable Harry Christophers, though the choir – ranged behind him in the front rows of the stalls, turning to face the audience – was under the control of chorus master Simon Halsey. This startling reverse of personnel put the choir front and centre, visually and sonically. Rarely have 100 singers been under such intense scrutiny. Discipline was high, diction superb, few heads buried in copies. Their first pianissimo entry, sung from memory, sent shivers up the spine and their burst of dazzling colour on “and there was light” was truly exciting, but some problems lurk here. The tenors in particular lack a true top, too often resorting to falsetto, too often dulling the edge of Haydn’s exciting fugal writing. There was nothing dull about the soloists, though. Soprano Lucy Crowe, tenor Andrew Staples and baritone Roderick Williams – each great communicators – sang with joyful playfulness, Crowe particularly vivacious as Eve, representing all women with a mischievous eye-roll when pledging “obedience” to Adam. Yeah, sure. Newly minted teenage musicians at the Bobby Moore Academy, east London, have the luck to be coached by the young players of the rejuvenated Bath Festival Orchestra. Now, for the first time – cue loud hurrahs – the school has its own 24-piece orchestra. Its members will soon be performing alongside their teachers at a series of London lunchtime concerts. In the meantime, the BFO, under conductor Peter Manning, made a truly impressive appearance at Kings Place, accompanying the brilliantly emphatic young Dutch cellist Ella van Poucke in Schumann’s Cello Concerto in A minor, dazzling us with the hot Mediterranean sunshine of Mendelssohn’s Italian Symphony, and giving the UK premiere of Alba Rosa Viëtor’s Five Symphonic Sketches from 1962. This was a revelation, the pleasing dissonances and scrunchy clashes very much of their time, and no less welcome for that – rather like the best mid-20th-century sculpture, abstract yet warmly humane.

3/12/2022,"It is two years since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Covid-19 a global pandemic. Society has reopened, life has resumed. Attention has turned, understandably, to the harrowing crisis in Ukraine. No one would blame you for hoping you’d heard the last of Covid. Yet on Thursday, the director general of the WHO tweeted that the pandemic is “far from over”. Given the removal of mitigations by the Westminster government you would be forgiven for thinking differently. Speaking to friends and relatives, they seem surprised that Covid cases and hospitalisations are rising again, and have been for the past two weeks. In south-west England, hospital admissions are already higher than at the peak of the Omicron wave. The south-east will soon follow. In order to understand the implications of these recent upticks for the future of the pandemic, we need to put our finger on what caused them. Is this just a bump in the road towards high-level endemicity, or do these figures herald the start of yet another NHS-threatening wave? There are a number of competing hypotheses that might explain why we are seeing rises. It could be waning immunity, changes in testing, the relaxation of mitigations, behavioural change, a new variant or any combination of these. Looking more closely at the data, we can start to eliminate some possibilities. These rises are probably not the result of waning immunity from boosters. The booster rollout was staggered by age, so if immunity was waning, we’d expect to see cases and hospitalisations increase in the older age groups, who are now further from their booster. We aren’t, though. Cases in different age groups all started to increase at roughly the same time. On top of this, the latest edition of the Office for National Statistics’ antibody survey shows high percentages of adults (95% or above) in the UK continue to have Covid antibodies. So if not waning immunity, could it be the BA2 subvariant of Omicron, which has recently become dominant across the UK? It’s possible that the rise of this more transmissible strain could be contributing to the increases in cases and hospital admissions that we’re seeing. There’s also Deltacron, the nickname for a variant first detected in France in January, with similar-looking variants found in the Netherlands and Denmark. It won’t yet be contributing significantly to the numbers in the UK, but may play a role in coming months: its presence in multiple locations suggests it’s not a flash in the pan. But the most obvious explanation for the rise in rates is the impact of Downing Street’s removal of all remaining Covid mitigations, including self-isolation. This will undoubtedly have led to more infections and hospitalisations, and may well have been enough to reverse the trend of falling cases we had been enjoying for almost two months previously. Hospitalisations and cases began to increase around the same time in all regions and in all age groups, supporting the idea that this national-level edict, and the behavioural change it has engendered, are the root cause of the recent losses of the precious ground we gained in the battle against Covid. What is perhaps harder to explain is why hospitalisations started rising at the same time, or even slightly before, cases did. There is usually a lag of seven to 10 days between people testing positive and hospitalisation, if required. Usually we’d expect to see cases rise ahead of hospital admissions. We know there have been recent alterations to testing requirements and test accessibility, so perhaps we are seeing the impact of those changes in the data. Hospital settings, in which testing availability and behaviour shouldn’t significantly affect numbers, might have picked up the increases earlier, while drops in community testing gave the artificial appearance that cases were falling. The latest data from NHS England suggests that most Covid patients in hospital do not have Covid as their primary diagnosis, which might indicate some degree of in-hospital infection. That said, even when Covid is not the primary diagnosis, it may still be the trigger for the underlying cause of hospitalisation and so may also need to be treated. Whatever the cause of the recent increases, even if cases plateaued around current levels, this would still constitute bad news. Endemicity has been one of the most misappropriated and misunderstood concepts during the pandemic. It means roughly constant levels of infection, but says nothing about how high those levels are and how severe their impact: the common cold is endemic, but so too is malaria. Smallpox was endemic, until eradicated. Endemic does not mean benign. While we fail to take measures to mitigate the pandemic, we will continue to suffer a high disease burden. Despite what politicians say, the pandemic is not over. And while Covid may have been forgotten by some, it is far from gone.

3/12/2022,"If anything about the UK’s response to Covid-19 was world-beating, it was our surveillance system. From the World Health Organization to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), public health teams around the world have praised the UK’s infection-tracking capability, and used our data to plan their own pandemic measures. Despite this health ministers have cancelled future funding for the React-1 study and other research projects. The decision has been met with dismay among leading scientists and researchers worldwide, who have questioned the UK’s ability to respond to future Covid threats. Last week, researchers from Imperial College London revealed the latest turn in the pandemic with the finding that infections had begun to rise in people aged 55 and over. Imperial’s scientists work with Ipsos Mori to analyse PCR test results from more than 100,000 people a month . The results from React-1, alongside the weekly Covid infection survey from the Office for National Statistics’ (ONS) have given precise snapshots of how many people are infected and which areas are worst affected. The surveys are much more reliable than self-selecting community testing data, which misses many asymptomatic cases. Yet Professor Paul Elliott, director of the React (Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission) study at Imperial, said last week its future depended on funding from the Department of Health and Social Care – and that funding would cease this month. “We have one more round,” he said, at the announcement of the 18th set of findings last week. “So we’re going to be in the field from now till the end of March, but we’re not funded beyond that.” Other research, including the Zoe Covid app, which tracks people’s symptoms and has cost £5m over the past two years, is also being defunded. Professor Tim Spector, who leads the research, said they had received “only a few weeks’ notice” of the “disappointing news”, after being assured by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) that it was almost certain that funding would continue. “We strongly believe that decision is a really bad mistake,” he said, adding that it cost only 1% of the funding needed for the ONS study. The UKHSA’s own Siren study, which tracks infections in health workers and found that vaccine protection begins after two weeks, is ending recruitment on 31 March, although the body’s chief medical adviser, Susan Hopkins, said in a blogpost it would “continue to answer the most important questions about Covid-19 infection, reinfection and antibodies”. University College London’s £4m Vivaldi study, tracking infections in care homes since May 2020, runs only until April 2022, according to UCL’s website. And the CoMix social contacts survey, run by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which asks people how many direct contacts they have had with other people, stopped collecting data on 2 March and has published its final routine report. The ONS weekly survey is to continue, after Sajid Javid, the health secretary, reportedly lobbied to keep it, in the face of Treasury cuts. Professor Marc Lipsitch, director of science for the CDC’s Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, visited the UK last month to speak to researchers at the ONS and Imperial with a view to setting up a similar system in the US. “I think the UK can be justifiably proud of the system that it had, and it would be wise to try to build on that for future preparedness,” he said. “From a scientific perspective, React, together with the ONS Covid infection survey, provided the UK with a level of awareness of the pandemic that was really exceptionally good.“A proper random sample of the population is a very much superior way to understand the number of people who have the virus and the number of people who have had the virus, which are the two most critical things in understanding the progress. “[It] is a gold standard for how to understand the pandemic. And certainly one way to be prepared for future waves or other viruses is to keep some capacity going.” The UKHSA itself praised the work of the React-1 team in a blogpost in December, describing its work as “crucial in helping the government’s response to the pandemic”. It highlighted as one of React’s “key achievements” the discovery that a third of cases are asymptomatic. Professor Sylvia Richardson, president of the Royal Statistical Society, said: “These two studies, the ONS survey and React, are unique in the world in my opinion. We should be proud of them. React picked up very early, in December 2020, that infections in the London area were not decreasing as expected. Now they’re picking up that cases are rising in the older population. They are picking up trends and we can trust those trends because of the robust way the study is done. “The government says we have to learn to live with Covid, but to learn to do that we need data which is agile enough and trustworthy enough. The ONS survey and React have been very good examples of agile and trustworthy programmes. “We know immunity is going to wane and health authorities have to decide how to deal with that, with recommendations for boosters, for example. So they need reliable information about what is going on to target their strategy. “React has given very good information about the effectiveness of vaccines and can monitor the waning of immunity. The pandemic is not yet in a stable equilibrium. Many factors are still changing and we need to keep monitoring basic epidemiological quantities such as prevalence in a reliable way. “I would like to see a strategic plan for preparedness in terms of what type of studies and resources they are going to keep. So far, myself and other experts at the Royal Statistical Society haven’t been consulted, and there seems to be a lack of strategy – we don’t know how they are going to monitor new variants, for example.”",News/World news,Dismay as funding for UK’s ‘world-beating’ Covid trackers is axed,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/dismay-as-funding-for-uks-world-beating-covid-trackers-is-axed
3/12/2022,"One of the most instantly recognisable voices of the 90s, singer Heather Small was born in west London in 1965. A chance meeting with Hacienda DJ Mike Pickering led to the formation of M People, who went on to sell more than 10m records of uplifting dance pop. After the birth of her son, James, with rugby player and coach Shaun Edwards, she released a solo album, Proud. James is now the Labour party candidate for Bayswater ward in Westminster, and is on Labour’s Future Candidates Programme. Heather’s solo tour begins on 17 March. My precious boy James was two when this picture was taken. We were visiting Harrison’s cave in Barbados, where my family are from. I wanted to show him: these are your people, son, and you are utterly loved. With James being of dual heritage, it was important he knew his Bajan side as well as having pride in his dad’s white, working-class, northern upbringing. Taking him to Barbados, I could show him a world where women that looked like his mum, gran and aunt were doing everything from being a judge in court to sweeping the roads. Racism is alive and kicking, but when I was a child in the 70s, it was so unfettered. People were in my face with it. As a mother, it is my duty to give James the tools to deal with adversity. If anyone tells my son to “go home”, I want him to reply: “Yeah, I’m going to Maida Vale right now.” As a little girl, I’d have questioned: should I really be here? Racism is a distraction – I spent too much time deliberating my place. When James was at preschool, he was one of two black boys. One day, a teacher called my son the other boy’s name. I thought: there’s only two of them, they don’t look alike, and you think they’re interchangeable? He didn’t stay there long. He will not be put into a second-class category by anyone. I apply that mindset to women and girls, too. When you refuse to give people your power, you are seen as being obstructive or not nice. I say: forget nice and stuff being pretty. Sharpen your elbows. Stand your ground. While I wasn’t affiliated with ladette culture in the 90s, I’d see women mimicking what was then seen as masculine behaviour. I thought: if that’s you, then good. But I didn’t think everyone doing it was being authentic. That’s not a judgment. But true power is understanding who you are and living by your rules. Being pregnant was the one time I felt special and beautiful. But not everyone was happy. After James was born, I felt I had to carry on as if I wasn’t a mother, and there were commitments with M People I needed to fulfil. So I did. James was born in March 1998, and by November he was with me on tour. It was the most difficult thing I’ve done as a working mother, but the pain of doing it without him would have been worse. I went on to release my solo album, Proud, two years later. Friends and people in the industry breathed a sigh of relief when they saw I wasn’t going to give up singing, but things had changed. I was passionate about my career, but my son was number one. I’m not going to apologise for that. I’m never Heather Small the singer when I’m at home. When James got older, he found out I’d won a Mercury prize and Brit awards, and asked where I was keeping them. I said: “They’re in a cupboard.” There are no discs on the wall. I don’t need a shrine to myself. James is serious, but balanced. Every day he teaches me something. I can be highly strung – I’m an artist. It’s all great, or it’s all terrible! James will say: “It’s good you are passionate, but if you get too heated that might negate your argument.” And he’s right. He’ll do well in politics. People used to ask, what do you want James to be when he grows up? I’d say: “A renaissance man.” When he was three, I asked him the same question and assumed he’d say something like, “A fireman.” Instead, he replied: “King of the world, Mum!” I thought: yeah, there he is, that’s the son I nurtured. This photo is definitely indicative of our relationship – we have always been close friends. As well as visiting Barbados, I’d go away with Mum for her work. Being on tour was great fun – travelling broadens your mind. Plus I was allowed to order room service. I’ve never been that conscious of my mum being famous. Nobody cared at school, but she’d get attention when we’d be out together. In 2005, Mum was a cultural ambassador for London’s bid to stage the Olympics and someone barracked us in the street, saying: “What are you doing? It’s a waste of money.” I think she told them to get lost. My mum is formidable, but she’s also gregarious and good fun. Growing up, it was us and my grandma in a house in west London. My parents’ split didn’t impact me negatively, and Dad would come over every night. It wasn’t a busy, bustling house; Mum is quite low-key. Definitely not the sort of person who’s friends with lots of celebrities. Mum grew up black and female, and had to confront everything that comes with that. She had a hugely successful career, in spite of ups and downs. She was signed at 22, thought she was going to make it, then was dropped. A lot of people would find that hard to come back from. But she joined M People and her career went from there. That resilience has been instilled in me. She has also inspired my career in politics. Mum spent her childhood in Dixon House, the council block next to Grenfell. Her parents were part of the Windrush generation. A commitment to social justice was present in our house. I was a key worker in a food bank during the first wave of the pandemic. We made sure people who wouldn’t have food did. I found it frustrating because we were a short-term fix. I realised I should devote myself to politics and make a change. I have no ambition to be prime minister – even if that vacancy could open up soon! When I was eight, I watched Mum perform at the Manchester Arena. I was struck by an overwhelming sense of pride. I never feel nervous when I see her on stage. She always smashes it.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Heather Small looks back: ‘James was born in March – by November he was with me on tour’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/12/heather-small-looks-back-son-politics-pop-parenthood
