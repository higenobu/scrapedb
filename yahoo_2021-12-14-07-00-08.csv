12/14/2021,"Delta Air Lines is exiting three markets to small cities in Wyoming, Colorado, and Nebraska, citing low demand. The airline is also slashing service to four other airports, though will still fly to them from alternate hubs. The move comes as airlines continue to cut unsustainable and unprofitable regional routes. Delta Air Lines is making changes to its domestic network and three small cities in the US are losing service from the carrier indefinitely, with seven routes overall getting cut. Atlanta-based Delta is dropping service to cities in several states across the US, including Wyoming, Wisconsin, Montana, Nebraska, Michigan, Colorado, and Indiana, the airline later confirmed to Insider and The Points Guy first reported. Three cities will lose their service entirely, including Lincoln, Nebraska, and Grand Junction, Colorado, both of which will end January 10, and Cody, Wyoming, where seasonal service was suspended in October 2021 and will not return. ""Due to ongoing travel demand impact from the pandemic, we have made the difficult decision to suspend Delta Connection service to these markets,"" a Delta spokesperson told Insider in an email statement. ""We are working to re-accommodate customers with alternate plans or offer refunds as quickly as possible. We are grateful to all who supported this service throughout the years."" Most of the markets are small towns, which are becoming a common casualty of network adjustments due to low demand and high costs. According to Delta, the four cities that are seeing reduced service will still be served via other Delta hubs beginning January 10. Take a look at the routes and cities that Delta will cut indefinitely: Between Detroit, Michigan, and La Crosse, Wisconsin: Delta is dropping its service from Detroit to La Crosse, though it will still serve the airport from Minneapolis, and American offers flights from Chicago. Between Minneapolis, Minneapolis, and Great Falls, Montana: Delta is cutting its service from Minneapolis to Great Falls, though it will still serve the airport from Salt Lake City. Meanwhile, Alaska offers flights from Seattle, United operates from Denver, and Allegiant flies from Las Vegas and Phoenix-Mesa. Between Minneapolis, Minneapolis, and Lincoln, Nebraska: Delta is ending its service from Minneapolis to Lincoln indefinitely, cutting the only route Delta operated to the city. However, United still offers flights from Denver and Chicago. Between Minneapolis, Minneapolis, and Marquette County, Michigan: Delta is dropping its service from Minneapolis to Marquette County, though it will still offer flights from Detroit, and American flies from Chicago. Between Salt Lake City, Utah, and Cody, Wyoming: Delta is cutting its service from Salt Lake City to Cody indefinitely, ending flights to one of the gateways to Yellowstone National Park. However, United still offers flights from Denver. Between Salt Lake City, Utah, and Grand Junction, Colorado: Delta is dropping its service from Salt Lake City to Cody, exiting the market entirely. However, the airport still had a number of route options, including United and Frontier from Denver, Allegiant from Phoenix-Mesa, Las Vegas, and Santa Ana, California, and American from Dallas/Fort Worth, Phoenix Sky Harbor, and Los Angeles. Between Salt Lake City, Utah, and Indianapolis, Indiana: Delta is dropping its service from Salt Lake City to Indianapolis, though it will still offer flights to the Indiana city from Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, New York-JFK, New York-La Guardia, and Minneapolis. The airport is also served by nine other US carriers, like Southwest, Spirit, and Frontier. Delta is not the only carrier exiting small markets. In early November, United Airlines pulled out of 11 cities indefinitely, leaving some markets with just one commercial operator. The airline cited unsustainability for the long term as a reason for its exit. According to Henry Harteveldt, president and travel industry analyst of Atmosphere Research Group, these small cities are expensive to operate to and low demand has made it difficult to be profitable. However, he emphasized that the pandemic has impacted airlines' decisions and companies do not have a moral obligation to serve small markets. ""In the wake of the most financially brutal 18 months that the global airline industry has experienced due to the COVID pandemic, airlines are going to seek out markets that they believe will give them an advantage, but if a city isn't profitable, they will cut it,"" Harteveldt told Insider in November. Meanwhile, American has also cut service to small cities, like New Haven, Connecticut, in September, according to the Hartford Courant. Avelo Airlines is the only commercial operator out of the city, having launched operations in November.

12/14/2021,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Winter arrived early in Northern California with wind, rain and snow that was expected to intensify Monday as forecasters warned that mountain passes will probably be closed to traffic and areas burned by wildfires could face rockslides and mudslides following an especially warm and dry fall across the U.S. West. The multiday storm, a powerful “atmospheric river” weather system that is sucking up moisture from the Pacific Ocean, raised the threat of flooding and was expected to dump more than 8 feet (2.4 meters) of snow on the highest peaks in California and Nevada and drench other parts of the two states before it moves on midweek, forecasters said. “This is a pretty widespread event,” said National Weather Service meteorologist Anna Wanless in Sacramento. “Most of California, if not all, will see some sort of rain and snow.” The storm will bring much needed moisture to the broader region that’s been gripped by drought that scientists have said is caused by climate change. The latest U.S. drought monitor shows parts of Montana, Oregon, California, Nevada and Utah are classified as being in exceptional drought, which is the worst category. Most western U.S. reservoirs that deliver water to states, cities, tribes, farmers and utilities rely on melted snow in the springtime. This week's storm is typical for this time of the year but notable because it’s the first big snow that is expected to significantly affect travel with ice and snow on the roads, strong winds and limited visibility, Wanless said. Drivers on some mountain passes on Sunday had to put chains on their tires and were warned of possible road closures in coming days. “Travel will be hazardous and is highly discouraged,” the weather service office in Sacramento said on Twitter. Heavy rain could cause minor flooding and rockslides, especially in areas that scarred by wildfires, forecasters said. Gusts were so strong in and around San Francisco that state transportation officials issued a wind advisory for the Bay Bridge that connects the city with Oakland and warned drivers of campers and trailers to avoid the 4.5-mile (7.2-kilometer) span late Sunday. South of the San Francisco Bay Area, a 40-mile (64-kilometer) stretch of the iconic Highway 1 in California's Big Sur area was closed as a precaution until Tuesday. The scenic coastal route frequently experiences damage during wet weather. Nearby Monterey County residents who live close to burn scars from last year's Dolan Fire were warned to be prepared to evacuate if rains loosen hillsides and cause debris flows. In Southern California, the San Bernardino County sheriff's department issued evacuation warnings  for several areas, citing the potential for flooding, and Los Angeles County fire officials urged residents to be aware of the potential for mud flows. Forecasters said strong winds accompanying the storm could lead to power outages. Karly Hernandez, a spokesperson for Pacific Gas & Electric, said crews and equipment are staged across the state to respond quickly if the power goes out. The second storm predicted to hit California midweek shortly after the current storm moves on could deliver almost continuous snow in mountainous areas, said Edan Weishahn of the weather service in Reno, which monitors an area straddling the Nevada state line. Donner Summit, one of the highest points on Interstate 80 and a major commerce commuter route, could face major travel disruptions or road closures, Weishahn said. The weather follows a November that was unseasonably warm for California. Vail Resorts’ three Tahoe-area ski resorts opened with limited offerings over the weekend after crews produced artificial snow. Spokeswoman Sara Roston said the resorts are looking forward to more of the real thing. The Sierra Avalanche Center warned heavy snow and strong winds on top of a weak snowpack could cause large and destructive avalanches. One man died Saturday in a backcountry area of the Crystal Mountain ski resort in Washington state when he was caught in an avalanche that temporarily buried five others. ___ Weber reported from Los Angeles.",U.S./Associated Press,"Big California storm dumps snow, drenches parched regions",https://news.yahoo.com/rain-snow-fall-california-braces-055850306.html
