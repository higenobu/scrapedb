2/27/2022,"Iam really just so lucky to have my job. Back in 2017, I was given the privilege of visiting horticulturists all over Japan, from top Chelsea designers to Zen Buddhist monks, for a BBC filming project. These were people I would never otherwise have had the chance to meet, let alone learn from, and goodness me I had so many questions. However, to my great surprise, my most important lesson wasn’t on the subjects I set out wanting to learn more about, but on one of the random recurring themes that kept coming up unprompted in our conversations: their all-consuming love of flower arranging. In particular, I learned how learning to play with different colour, texture and form combinations was thought to be crucial to helping these experts hone their skills. I say “to my surprise”, not because I was unaware of the centuries of tradition in Japan of floral art, but because it was seen not as a mere decorative hobby– which is how it is often dismissed in the West – but as an essential professional teaching tool with surprisingly broad applications. I suppose, when it comes down to it, whether you are a gardener, painter, fashion designer or architect, we are all working with arranging natural elements to somehow satisfy instinctive visual preferences that have arisen from millions of years of co-evolution with the natural world. You know how some combinations just look “wrong”, and yet are suddenly calming, striking or pleasing with the tiniest tweaks, even if we can’t articulate exactly why? So it makes sense that experimenting with cut plants would be a perfect way to connect with these instinctive design laws, even if you are applying it to what – at least to Western eyes – are totally different projects. As with so many uniquely Japanese concepts, it can seem quirky until you realise it’s we who are the weird ones for not having appreciated the simplicity and practicality all along. However, what surprised me even more was the fact that these experts told me not only how to be a better designer, but why. To them, the purpose of creating these pleasing arrangements was not the end result, as we tend to think in the West, but the process itself. When you create these works from pieces of flowers, stems and leaves, forming some kind of mental order from chaos, you are really cultivating your own thoughts. It helps you explore ideas you might otherwise find hard to achieve cognitive clarity on – and you get to convey these to others. It was such a revelation to me. Ever since then, I keep fancy Japanese secateurs with me to practise what these masters taught me, whether it’s to pause on a local woodland walk to set out some leaves on a fallen log, or to take cuttings from my balcony to create an arrangement to brighten up a mate’s day. I can’t believe I had to travel to the other side of the world to properly appreciate something I had on my doorstep. So if you do one thing this weekend to not only make you a better gardener, but to help calm your mind, wander outdoors with secateurs and gather material to make a masterpiece.

2/27/2022,"When I talked to the journalist Rana Ayyub in her Mumbai home last Wednesday she was calmer than she was when I had spoken to her three days earlier. But that is not saying much. Last Sunday her words were jumbled, her voice on edge. She said she had not slept. That she could not eat or keep food down. That she had had thoughts of self-harm. “I was on a plane yesterday and I said to my brother, ‘Can you feel me sitting next to me?’ And he said, ‘Have you completely lost it?’ And I said, ‘No, I’m just not sure I’m sitting next to you. I feel like I’m in a dream.’ And afterwards, I spoke to my psychiatrist and she said, ‘You’re dissociating. You’ve had a traumatic experience –that’s your brain shutting down.’” In fact, this is a highly rational response to what Ayyub is going through. In a crowded field, she may well be the most hated journalist on Earth. As an investigative journalist, she had been a thorn in the side of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and his allies for more than a decade. And as a commentator with a column in the Washington Post, she had repeatedly embarrassed him and his government on the international stage. But the attacks and abuse she has suffered for years reached a crisis last week. A crisis that mirrors what is happening in India itself. As a journalist, Ayyub has been repeatedly warning that the Modi government’s hostility to Muslims will tip into violence. And as a Muslim journalist, she knows it already has. She is not just reporting on India’s dangerous slide into authoritarianism and violent extremism, she is living it. In the past few weeks she has had police charges filed against her in multiple states and been subjected to a vicious propaganda campaign accompanied by horrific online abuse. She was calmer when I spoke to her last Wednesday, partly because the United Nations had issued a statement in support of her, citing her “judicial harassment” and “misogynistic and sectarian” targeting. “The worse thing is the lack of journalistic solidarity,” she had told me last Sunday, though international organisations such as Reporters Without Borders and Index on Censorship had stepped up for her. But it is happening in the context of crucial elections in five states and hate speech, with Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) using inflammatory rhetoric against Muslims in official communications. Last month the director of the campaign group Genocide Watch, Gregory Stanton, said that he believed “a genocide could very well happen in India”. His voice joined others such as that of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and drew an explicit link to the experience of living in Rwanda, which had led him to found his organisation. In 1989 he had told Rwanda’s then president that “if you don’t do something to prevent genocide in your country, there is going to be a genocide within five years.” Five years later there was a genocide in Rwanda. The same conditions, he said, are in place in India today and that genocide is not an “event” but a “process” – a process that includes extreme polarisation and a government that is daily inciting violence against a minority. It is Ayyub’s continuing daily stress of reporting on this over years – beginning with an undercover investigation in Modi’s home state of Gujarat in 2011 that implicated him and his allies in the massacre of more than 1,000 Muslims in 2002 – that is the background to her latest crisis. It is a crisis that has seen the Indian authorities open a corruption investigation into her that has included freezing her bank accounts and led last week to two UN special rapporteurs making a statement in her defence. “The lack of condemnation and proper investigation by the government, coupled with the legal harassment it has itself inflicted on Ms Ayyub has only served to falsely legitimise the attacks and attackers and further endangered her safety,” it said. And that is not even the worst of Ayyub’s troubles. “I was in Delhi to meet my lawyers to discuss the case and I went on the BBC to discuss the hijab ban in India and Muslim women not being allowed in educational institutions to study. That’s a new thing that’s never happened before.” A video of a young Muslim girl wearing a hijab being hounded by a mob of men had gone viral and on the BBC Ayyub “called them rightwing terrorists. Because these are people who are terrorising a woman”. The interview led to new charges against her in five states. She has been accused of “sedition” and “defaming the Hindu community”. And last Sunday, as her grandmother lay dying, she was unable to travel to her home state of Uttar Pradesh to be with her because she feared arrest. What is happening to Ayyub is so extreme, and so complex in the way her harassment by the Indian authorities is intimately entwined with her harassment on social media. Hindu activists used Twitter and Facebook to appeal for more people to come forward and file cases against her. “And the day that started, ‘Arrest Rana Ayyub’ trended for 48 hours,” she said. The International Center for Journalists (ICFJ) and Sheffield University computer scientists are monitoring and analysing the threats against Ayyub in real time and they see a shocking story of online violence in the data. On the same day I contacted Ayyub to check that she was OK, Julie Posetti, the global director of research at the ICFJ, messaged me to say that its monitoring had shown that “the threats against her are escalating badly. I’m really worried she’s going to be killed by an IRL [in real life] virtual lynch mob.” This is far from a frivolous fear. In 2017, Ayyub’s good friend, fellow Muslim journalist Gauri Lankesh, was gunned down by Hindu extremists. “I had put out a Facebook post about how I was disillusioned with what was happening and the way people were treating me on Twitter and she wrote on my Facebook saying, ‘Babe, they are paper tigers. Don’t get intimidated.’ The next day, she was shot dead outside her house.” What is striking about Ayyub is the way she is able to articulate all this. Even in the midst of her torment, she is able to express her horror and relate it to the wider issue of what is happening in India. She, too, fears that she is witnessing the early stages of a genocide. “The day before yesterday, the BJP’s Twitter handle, its Instagram handle, put a caricature of Muslim men hanging from a noose,” she said. The world is not paying attention to what is happening in India. Ayyub is scathing about social media companies’ failure to take action, especially Facebook, a primary mode of communication across a country of 1.4 billion people. An explosive article in the Wall Street Journal had revealed that one of the company’s most senior executives in the country had herself posted anti-Muslim hate material. Genocide Watch’s Stanton makes the connection between Myanmar and the Rohingya and the Indian government’s treatment of the Kashmiris, who have been subjected to extreme measures and denial of their basic rights in the almost entirely Muslim state. In Myanmar, the UN said Facebook was a crucial tool that the government used to incite violence – exactly what is also happening in India right now. “They took down the BJP’s post. But they should have removed the account,” said Ayyub. The worst thing, perhaps, is that Ayyub believes she is fortunate compared with other journalists in India, a country that has slipped to 142 out of 180 for press freedom, according to Reporters Without Borders’ World Press Freedom Index. Her column in the Washington Post has afforded her an international audience, and last Sunday the newspaper put out a full-page advert in support of her, saying the free press in India is under attack. Other journalists are in jail or hiding. But it is still too much for her. That was what was abundantly clear in my two calls last week. “I feel like a child again,” said Ayyub. Her mother had travelled to be with her grandmother as she lay dying, but before she had gone, said Ayyub, “I actually became a child. I asked her to sleep next to me.”",News/World news,"Reviled, harassed, abused: Narenda Modi’s most trenchant critic speaks out",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/reviled-harassed-abused-narenda-modis-most-trenchant-critic-speaks-out
2/27/2022,"British science is facing the threat of a highly damaging brain drain that could see scores of top young researchers leaving the UK. In addition, the futures of several major British-led international projects are also now in jeopardy following a delay in funding by the European Union. Senior scientists say the UK’s scientific standing is at serious risk while others have warned that major programmes – including medical projects aimed at tackling global scourges such as malaria – face cancellation. “There is a real prospect that bright young scientists will decide it will be best for their careers if they leave the UK,” said Martin Smith, head of policy at the Wellcome Trust. “At the same time, if research partnerships involving the UK break down, Britain will no longer be seen as a reliable scientific partner. UK science will suffer.” British science is threatened because of the government’s ongoing rows with the EU. After Brexit, ministers had agreed a deal that would allow Britain to continue to play a major role in Europe’s vast research programme. But the subsequent failure of talks over Northern Ireland has led to a major delay with this arrangement. As a result, dozens of scientists given grants earlier this month as part of this year’s round of EU funding awards had these offers revoked only a few days later. “We got a letter congratulating us because it had been decided to give our malaria project an €8m [£6.7m] grant from the EU’s Horizon programme,” said Professor Chris Drakeley at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). His team had put together a research programme aimed at identifying people infected with the malaria parasite, Plasmodium vivax, which can lie dormant in a patient’s liver for years before triggering illness. “We were delighted,” said Drakeley. “ It had been very hard work putting together the project and setting up partnerships in Africa. Then, a couple of days later, we got a new letter saying the UK was now ineligible to take part.” Drakeley is now trying to find new partnership deals within the EU to ensure the project can proceed. “We are ploughing on in the hope it’s going to go ahead, but it’s all very uncertain,” he told the Observer. The EU has two main approaches to research funding, which it implements through its Horizon funding scheme. One is to give out highly prestigious European Research Council (ERC) grants to individual researchers. The other is to provide awards to groups of institutions who wish to combine forces for research, such as the malaria project. After Brexit, the UK agreed to pay £15bn over seven years to remain in these schemes. The deal, agreed a year ago, was greeted with relief by UK scientists, who have a strong record in attracting EU funding. This would allow them to continue with projects in a host of different fields, from medicine to physics. But now that the agreement has been suspended, there is a growing fear that the impact on British science could be highly damaging. “British scientists are now in the position where they are getting no research funding from the EU and no funding from the UK government to fill that gap,” said Liam Smeeth, director of LSHTM. “Things are going to fall apart and really harm UK science around the world. We are a global superpower when it comes to research and now we are throwing it away. It will also lead to a loss of trust and potential partners in future collaborations.” Nor is the danger confined to hard science. The British Academy has pointed out that about a third of all UK archaeology research is funded from Europe while classics, law and philosophy also get substantial support this way. “If that source disappears, then we would face a real risk of triggering a brain drain,” said Hetan Shah, chief executive of the British Academy. The government has said it is trying to find ways to make up any funds that are lost to researchers in the UK. However, the uncertainty is causing damage, say senior scientists. They also point out that ERC grants are so prestigious, receiving one represents a boost to a young researcher’s career. A cash substitute is very unlikely to be attractive enough to keep many of their recipients in the UK. This point was also stressed by John Dainton, founder of the Cockcroft Institute, a centre for particle accelerator research in Cheshire. It has attracted dozens of top young researchers from across the world over the years. “Now that is all under threat,” Dainton told the Observer. “Young researchers won’t see any reason to stay and work in a country that has hung itself off the edge of Europe and is drifting into the Atlantic without direction. It is extremely worrying.” A government spokesperson said: “The UK stands ready to formalise our association to EU programmes at the earliest opportunity but, disappointingly, there have been persistent delays from the EU. To reassure researchers and innovators, the UK government has guaranteed funding for the first wave of eligible, successful applicants to Horizon Europe, who have been unable to sign grant agreements with the EU.”",News/Science,UK scientists fear brain drain as Brexit rows put research at risk,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/27/uk-scientists-fear-brain-drain-as-brexit-rows-put-research-at-risk
2/27/2022,"Ryan Wright stood around a campfire in Lupton, Arizona, a town on the Navajo reservation where members of an American trucker convoy protest were resting for the night. As the fire flickered he discussed a conspiracy myth about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, he proffered, was a distraction. “I’m not the only one that feels this way,” Wright said. “But I feel like it’s a big fat smokescreen to keep everyone distracted on what is really going on in the world.” Certainly the break out of a new land war in Europe had dealt Wright and his fellow trucker protestors a serious blow. Their attempt to replicate the Canadian trucker protests – which had closed borders and brought chaos to Canada’s capital city – had won wide support from Republican politicians, Fox News and rightwing social media. Surely, the same could happen in the US, whose political divides are so much starker than Canada’s. But Putin’s invasion had wiped the convoy’s progress off the media map. Having left Barstow in California amid honking horns and cheering supporters, the line of truckers was crossing the entire breadth of the US in a convoy and headed to Washington DC to protest Covid-19 vaccine mandates and a roster of other mostly conservative causes. But now – with Ukraine dominating airwaves across the globe – no one was paying much attention to the American truckers. Especially, perhaps, as the convoy was promoting “freedom” against restrictions in the US that have largely been lifted already as the pandemic has ebbed recently and weary politicians have focused on the economy. Another trucker, wearing an American and Canadian flag as a cape, nodded in agreement with Wright that it was all a plot. Others around the campfire too agree with the conspiracy myth that the outbreak of war in Europe is an attempt to divert attention away from this trucker convoy, which is currently about a couple hundred people parked in the desert of the American southwest. Around a hundred cars and several dozen semi-trucks that made up “the people’s convoy” had left California midweek with the aim of arriving in Washington just after Joe Biden’s delivery of the annual State of the Union speech on Tuesday night. Mindful of the possibility of a repeat of the chaos in Canada, the Pentagon had approved the deployment of 700 National Guard and 50 tactical vehicles to bolster Capitol police ahead of their expected arrival. But in the long distances the convoy has so far driven across the vast expanses of the American West, the convoy has had too few vehicles to make an impact on traffic or “clog up cities”, as right-wing Senator Rand Paul had declared he hoped they would. In the western United States, where most people drive cars rather than use public transportation, far larger queues of vehicles have been seen at the opening of an In-N-Out burger, for example. Most US states have also already rescinded many pandemic restrictions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced last week they would lift their recommendation for many Americans when it came to wearing masks. Now most Americans live in places where healthy people, including school kids, can go mask-free. Meanwhile, despite the truckers’ ire, America’s vaccine mandates, like the one Biden proposed, were never implemented after being struck down by the US courts. In the end, vaccine mandates were only put in place for certain healthcare workers participating in federal programs.But around the blazing campfire in Lupton the nation-wide easing of restrictions had not deterred the demonstrators. Some kept their distorted views of mandates that did not exist or simply did not believe Covid-19 was killing as many people as reported. “I haven’t got my shot and I don’t want to, there’s nothing wrong with me,” said Harrison Yazzie a member of the Diné Nation, the traditional name for the Navajo, and a local resident that came to greet the convoy. “But every day they say ‘Oh this many people got Covid, that many got Covid.’ But where I live, among the native people I don’t see no sirens, you know, running back and forth picking up people dying of Covid.” The facts say otherwise. Reporting by Native American news website IndianZ found that “in mid-2020, the Navajo Nation had the highest per-capita infection rate of Covid-19 in the US” Though those rates have dropped as tribal leaders have promoted vaccines and encouraged masks. But not everyone was despondent or seeing conspiracy. Some saw the chance for comradeship and a road trip.After the 300 mile journey from the previous stop in Kingman, Arizona, some locals who came to greet the convoy prepared a dinner of shredded elk barbecue and fry bread. Melissa Applin said she had never been to anything like this before, “It’s beautiful, it’s freedom I love it. I’ve made new friends.” Applin drove two and a half hours from her home to meet the convoy, “I’ve been helping cooking and smoking meats,” she said. Others were less bothered by the pandemic and more bothered by other American politics. For some, this convoy was just the latest in a series of demonstrations springing from their support for Donald Trump. Eric, who declined to provide a last name, said he attended multiple rallies for Trump and “Stop the Steal” rallies in the aftermath of the 2020 election. He is convinced – wrongly – that the election was stolen and the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol was “staged”. But despite some of the far-right and conspiratorial views of convoy participants, the demonstration has been peaceful with no indication it will escalate toward violence. Organizers have made an effort to exclude the violent elements like the Proud Boys and the Oathkeepers militia which have been promoting the convoy on some far-right tech platforms.The harsh, sometimes hateful attitudes found in these online groups, were often softened around the campfire in the cold Arizona desert. In many ways the convoy seemed to mostly reflect a real thirst for community, as people with like-minded politics found themselves connecting on other things – like camping beneath the stars.Eric brought his 14-year-old son Wyatt, who also declined to provide a last name, on the road for the convoy. The father and son duo have attended Trump rallies together and said they enjoy spending time together this way. Asked what it was like attending political protests with his dad, Wyatt responded: “Its fucking awesome.” But there is no getting away from the fact that the journey of the truckers – far from being a threat to anyone – is more of a Don Quixote-like quest tilting at rightwing windmills in their own minds. After all, in the 550 miles they’ve traveled so far, none of the gas stations, restaurants or hotels along the route have asked for their vaccine status or required masks indoors.",News/US news,‘Don Quixote-like quest’: Ukraine attack and easing Covid mandates leave US trucker protest on the fringe,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/27/america-peoples-convoy-trucker-protest
2/27/2022,"It is one of the most famous treasure wrecks ever discovered, a steamer named the “ship of gold” after it sank in 1857 off the coast of South Carolina with one of the largest cargoes of gold ever lost at sea. Miners who had struck it rich in the California gold rush were among those bringing home to New York their hard-earned wealth, only to lose their lives when the SS Central America was struck by a hurricane, sinking nearly a mile and a half beneath the waves. When nuggets, ingots and coins were recovered from the seabed in various expeditions between 1988 and 2014, the world was dazzled. But, with reported values of tens of millions of pounds, it sparked a complex legal case that landed its original treasure-hunter in jail. Now Dr Sean Kingsley, a British maritime archaeologist, is focusing attention on another facet of the recovered artefacts: an astonishing collection of 19th-century portraits that somehow survived at the bottom of the Atlantic. He told the Observer: “Glass plate photos had preserved the faces of miners, merchants and their families, staring up at the living from the seabed.” The portraits are eerie, but beautiful. These were the loved ones of those who had been on a ship that sank 150 miles from the Carolina coast with the loss of 425 lives. A judge and a comedian were among the passengers. Kingsley said: “There are two ships with iconic names. Titanic is known as the ‘ship of dreams’. This is known as the ‘ship of gold’. For me, the gold is a distraction. The glass plates are the true star treasures from this wreck. There’s dozens more down there that I hope one day will be saved too.” When the hurricane hit, those on board dumped their bags, unable to save their prized possessions as well as their lives. As the steamer sank, the bags floated down. The leather and canvas decomposed, while gold coins and clusters of daguerreotypes and ambrotypes with dozens of individual photographs were scattered across the seabed. Bob Evans has been researching the SS Central America since 1983 and he was the chief scientist and historian in the original field operation. He spoke of the excitement of recovering the photographs: “It’s over the top. They really bring forth the humanity of the event. We don’t know who these people in the photographs are. These were the last things these men had with them on the deck before the ship sank – and what a moment. These were the things that were most important to them, their money and these images. They represented friends or relatives or maybe even themselves.” He added: “When you look at the actual faces of people, it takes you right there. You are looking at folks who lived it – and they’re just like us, although the clothing and fashions have changed.” He pointed to a photograph of a young woman whose beauty captivated the men who recovered it: “She’s the Mona Lisa of the depths. This beautiful 18-year-old person, or however old she is, with her shoulders bare with jewellery and lace. It brings it across in a way that a coin does not. Coins have messages as well. But they’re harder to interpret, more intellectual and perhaps less visceral.” The photographs appear in the latest issue of Wreckwatch, the magazine that Kingsley edits. He said: “This is the largest cache of early photographs found at sea – and unpublished until now. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience to actually see faces from the deep.” Part of the delay in being able to publish the material has been due to the legal complexities surrounding the vessel. In 1988, in an expedition orchestrated by research scientist Tommy Thompson, the wreck was discovered by the Columbus-America Discovery Group, which conducted a scientific study of the marine life there, as well as recovering gold. Thompson has spent six years in prison, claiming not to know the whereabouts of part of that haul, to the fury of his former investors who helped raise millions for the expedition. They never saw any proceeds and finally sued. As the Guardian reported in 2020, he refused to cooperate with the authorities trying to find the treasure, and the judge found him in contempt, while he claims to have a rare syndrome affecting short-term memory. In 2014, Odyssey Marine Exploration was contracted by the original investors to return to the ship, recovering the photographs, jewellery and more gold. In their Wreckwatch study, Kingsley and Evans write that the miners had risked everything to head to California’s gold fields in search of a better life and that the voyage home to New York “should have been their crowning glory”. It is thought that 153 people survived the tragedy. Women and children were evacuated on the lifeboats and some of the men were rescued by other vessels. One survivor later recalled: “A great many of the passengers were miners, having considerable sums of gold about them, the product of years of toil. But the love of gold was forgotten in the anxiety and terror of the moment and many a man unbuckled his gold-stuffed belt and flung his hard-earned treasure upon the deck, some hoping to lighten their weight, and thus more easily keep themselves afloat, while others threw it away in despair, thinking there was no use for it in the watery grave they were going to.”",Arts/Art and design,Doomed ship of gold’s ghostly picture gallery is plucked from the seabed,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/27/doomed-ship-of-golds-ghostly-picture-gallery-is-plucked-from-the-seabed
2/27/2022,"In an era of rapid technological change, 50 years amounts to an aeon. To travel back to 5 March 1972 is to visit a disappeared world, a time of the Soviet Union and the cold war, of Ted Heath and Harold Wilson, when computers were the size of buses and programmed by men in lab coats, and spam wasn’t junk mail but a popular pork dish served from a can. There are very few surviving continuities, but notable exceptions are the Queen’s reign and the Observer Azed crossword. On that day 50 years ago, Jonathan Crowther, then a 29-year-old working for the Oxford University Press, set his first crossword for this newspaper. He was following in footsteps that had left a big impression. In 1926, Edward Powys Mathers effectively gave birth to the cryptic crossword with the one he set under the pseudonym of “Torquemada”. When he died, he was followed in 1939 by Derrick Macnutt, better known as Ximenes, a schoolmaster who laid down strict rules on what constituted a cryptic crossword clue. Macnutt’s own death – only mortality appears to stop crossword compilers – created another vacancy. “When Ximenes died,” recalls Crowther, “I sent in an ‘in memoriam’ puzzle in the shape of a large ‘X’. The crossword editor said, ‘We’d like to print your puzzle and, by the way, would you like to take on the job?” I was absolutely astonished and so flattered that I said ‘yes’ straight away without thinking about it.” According to John Finnemore, the comedian and crossword compiler (he sets the Times Listener crossword under the pseudonym “Emu”), Crowther has been the crowning glory of a 96-year triumvirate of Observer crossword setters. “The Observer’s three compilers form a sort of Socrates-Plato-Aristotle of cryptic crosswords,” he says. “Torquemada essentially invents the form, Ximenes codifies it and Azed perfects it.” On no less than 2,594 occasions over the past five decades, Crowther has set the cryptic crossword that, among aficionados of the form, is recognised as the finest in the field. In 1991, he was voted “best British crossword setter” in a Sunday Times poll and the same year earned the title of “the crossword compilers’ crossword compiler” in the Observer Magazine’s Experts’ Expert feature. He would also no doubt win the title as the most dependable, not just in terms of the standards he maintains, but also when it comes to attendance. Across the entire five decades of his stint, regardless of holidays, illness, the birth of his two sons or the kinds of crises that affect every family, he has not missed a single week in which the newspaper has been published. Crowther himself is characteristically modest about the achievement, but it’s hard to make a comparison for that kind of consistency, because so few exist. After all, Melvyn Bragg gets a two-month summer break on In Our Time, while Polly Toynbee is from time to time “away”. It might be thought that crossword compiling is an obscure line of work. But the extraordinary recent success of Wordle shows that there is a widespread appetite for word puzzles. If that online test is at the easy end of the spectrum, at the other end is the mysterious and rather daunting world of cryptic crosswords. Even the names of the setters are intimidating. Torquemada and Ximenes were interrogators, and therefore torturers, during the Spanish Inquisition. Azed sounds more benign but, typically, the name is both a play on the alphabet and a reversal of another Spanish inquisitor, Diego de Deza. You could almost imagine, with those kinds of pseudonyms, that the intention is to inflict mental pain. “Pleasurable pain, I hope,” Crowther says with a chuckle. Theirs may be an acquired taste, but cryptic crossword-solvers make up in loyalty and determination what they lack in numbers. Like his predecessors, Crowther has a dedicated group of followers, among whom there have been some notable names. The playwright and novelist Michael Frayn once described himself as “addicted” to Azed. Crowther met him at the Oxford literary festival some years ago, where Frayn was giving a talk. When Crowther introduced himself as Frayn was signing books, the author jumped to his feet, beaming with a big smile, and declared that Crowther was not at all how he had imagined him. Then turning to his wife and fellow author Claire Tomalin, he said: “Darling, this is the chap who you say ruins your Sundays.” The late Colin Dexter, author of the Morse books, was another keen, and rather successful, crossword-solver, winning a number of competitions. He also became a good friend of Crowther’s. The journalist and writer Francis Wheen is yet another devotee. He says he came relatively late to the party, towards the end of the last century. Up until that point, he’d done the normal cryptic crosswords, but had thought of Azed as looking “a bit weird for the likes of me”. Unlike most cryptic crosswords, the Azed grid has no black squares. Instead, every square is filled in to leave a dizzying collection of letters, making it look like something that had been produced at Bletchley Park. As Frayn says, “One of the astonishing things about Azed is that he uses a skeleton of lines instead of blocking, which makes composing the puzzle much harder for him, because he has to find many more common letters between across and down answers. By the same token it makes life easier for us solvers. Or should. But in fact it continues to be the hardest crossword I know. Mercifully.” Having overcome his reservations, Wheen wished he’d started earlier. For many years before the advent of phone apps, he found himself lugging around a hefty Chambers dictionary, deemed essential for crosswords. “I used to play cricket for the village team,” he recalls. “And when my side was batting I would sit outside the pavilion with a copy of the Observer and my Chambers dictionary. People would often come by and say, ‘That’s cheating. Any old fool could do it with a dictionary.’ I’d say, ‘All right, you do it then!’” Wheen has been a guest speaker at one of the celebratory lunches that are held, usually at an Oxford college, every 250 puzzles, and which draw about 150 people. To prepare, he met up with a hardcore group of Azed-solvers, called the Groundlings, who meet regularly to discuss the crossword. These are the kinds of people who not only complete the formidable puzzles, but also enter Crowther’s clue-writing competitions. Some of them are themselves setters of other newspaper’s crosswords. “On my right was a high court judge,” Wheen remembers, “and on my left an unreconstructed hippy.” Despite such lifestyle diversity, the large majority of serious crossword competitors are male and most are never going to see 50 again. Wheen described a character named Richard Heald, who has won the annual clue-writing competition eight times, as “the voice of youth”. “I’m 51,” admits Heald, “though I’m probably one of the youngest solvers.” There is an anxious and ongoing debate in crossword circles about how to attract women and younger people, although it does not as yet appear to have resulted in any great uptake from those constituencies. Crowther acknowledges the problem. “The younger generation are less attracted to crosswords than they used to be,” he says. “It’s sad, but I don’t think the crossword is in terminal decline. It will certainly see me out anyway.” Perhaps one aspect of the cryptic crossword that we may come to appreciate as we move deeper into the digital age is that it is, as Crowther puts it, “more or less computer-proof”. Whereas computers can beat any human being at chess, no computer can set or solve a decent cryptic crossword. Crowther says that people send him their research on trying to program computers to write cryptic clues. “Without exception, they are pretty useless. There’s no real-world knowledge there. No humour and I think you have to have a sense of humour, otherwise it would be dreary.” That’s not a word that anyone would use to describe Crowther’s work. Wheen speaks of “the consistent high standards of wit and elegance running through the entire oeuvre”, of a voice so distinctive that he feels he’s come to know the man through his clue-writing. Crowther himself demurs when I ask him what his own favourite is from the many thousands of clues he’s compiled down the years, preferring instead to praise the “staggering brilliance” of some of his readers in the competitions he runs. Heald testifies to Crowther’s masterly use of the “&lit” form of the clue, which combines definition and wordplay in a seamless whole. One example he gives is “My letters could make lad sad”. The answer is “Lass”, which is both definitional – a lass’s letters could make a lad sad – and wordplay, “L as s” means that lad becomes sad. The thought of Azed’s curious grid-full of cryptic letters coming to an end would make a lot of lads – and a few lasses – very sad indeed. Thankfully, Crowther, who turns 80 later this year, has no plans to quit just yet. He will continue his weekly routine of drawing out the blank pattern, then filling it in with words and, finally, the most demanding part of the job, coming up with the clues. “You don’t want to be satisfied with a second-rate clue,” says Crowther. “If it doesn’t please me, I’ll scrap it.” Therein lies the secret of all the delight and agony, the head-scratching, the pencil-chewing, the room-pacing frustration and air-punching elation that Crowther has provided for his grateful followers, going all the way back to when the UK agreed to join the European Economic Community, yet another endeavour that his crosswords have safely outlasted. Rest assured, there are plenty more “&lits” and anagrams to come from this extraordinary Aristotle of the puzzle page.",Lifestyle/Crosswords,"50 down: celebrating half a century of Azed, king of crosswords",https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2022/feb/27/50-down-celebrating-half-a-century-of-azed-king-of-crosswords
2/27/2022,"Ihave a nice list,” declares Nicola Coughlan. She pauses, perhaps to catch her breath at the end of another mile-a-minute answer, or perhaps for dramatic effect. “Of celebrities!” The disclosure comes somewhat out of nowhere, 40 minutes into our Friday-afternoon interview on Zoom. I’d asked the star of Derry Girls and Bridgerton about her public love-in with Kim Kardashian – not the tabs she’s been keeping, privately, on her new famous friends. In fact, Coughlan explains, “ideally” her nice list is of names she hasn’t met herself. “People are always going to be nice to you, aren’t they? This has to be evidence from several sources that they’re nice.” Margot Robbie is on it: “I’ve heard wonderful things about her.” So’s Kardashian – “my bestie Kim”, Coughlan jokes, who in fact sent her the shearling hoodie she’s wearing now. “And there was someone else…” Coughlan can’t remember. But, she tells me, she’s adding to it all the time. What about a naughty list, I ask. “Oh, yeah, that’s incredibly long,” she says immediately. “But everyone wants to know who’s awful. Don’t you want to know who’s nice?” Coughlan welcomes me into her London flat as if I’m an old friend, apologising for “being the world’s messiest bastard”, her robot vacuum cleaner fighting a losing battle against the chaos not quite concealed behind her. She turns her camera to show me three half-unpacked suitcases: “Like, what university fresher lives in this?” (She’s 35, but easily could pass for early 20s.) Coughlan has just returned home after a month-long “mega-hol”, split between work and play in New York, Austin and Hawaii. Next week she’ll be going back to New York, with the third and final season of Derry Girls due later this year, and Bridgerton returning to Netflix in March. Shonda Rhimes’s spin on the Regency England marriage market was, until recently, Netflix’s biggest-ever original, watched by 82m households in early 2021. (It’s since been overtaken by Squid Game.) At the time, Coughlan points out, spirits needed lifting with candy-coloured costumes and uncomplicated plots. “It was such an escape, and unapologetically joyful – there’s no cynicism to it. I love a dark, moody drama as much as the next person, but there was a real gap for something like Bridgerton.” That said, she adds: “We certainly didn’t think it was going to be the No 1 show on Netflix… How do you process that? You don’t, I think, is the answer.” Skip the next few paragraphs to avoid spoilers for the season one finale – although such is the industrial internet Bridgerton complex that you’ll have been hard-pressed to avoid them already. The show concluded on a cliffhanger, with the Gossip Girl-esque society columnist Lady Whistledown (narrated by Julie Andrews) revealed as Coughlan’s character, the bookish Penelope Featherington. Coughlan knew from the start, but had to be careful not to give the game away with her performance. “It had to be very subtle,” she says. “Selfishly, as an actor, I got to have so much fun – there was so much more given to me this time that I could play with.” Indeed, it’s a win for wallflowers everywhere: the bookish, always-the-bridesmaid type is shown to be the linchpin of the plot, with hidden riches and all of polite society in her thrall. Who cares if she gets the guy? There are parallels between Coughlan and her character, I suggest: an outsider on the A-list, a self-styled infiltrator of the elite, reporting back on the powerful and privileged to an eager public. Coughlan often shares her own star-struck encounters with her 1.3m Instagram followers (and a further 300,000 on Twitter). But pride comes before a fall for Penelope, Coughlan hints: “She’s sort of letting herself run away with it.” Part of what makes Coughlan so engaging on social media is that she’s excited by other people’s celebrity and unfazed by her own. She and Queer Eye’s Jonathan Van Ness became friends after she made a hoodie with his face on it. She and Kim Kardashian struck up a correspondence late last year after Coughlan revealed on Twitter that the Kardashians were the basis for the Featherington clan in Bridgerton. (“WHAT?!?! I am freaking out!!!!!!” responded Kim.) Coughlan has not only met her heroes, but won their acclaim: “RuPaul told me I was funny, so I can die happy now.” Saturday Night Live’s Kate McKinnon said she was her favourite Derry Girl, “and I’m sorry to the others, but I’m not going to not tell people that”. Many might have lost themselves in an ascent as rapid as her. But Coughlan says it’s the opposite – she has not been part of this world long enough to take it for granted. “Literally, I was working part-time in an optician’s five years ago. So for me, if anyone is tuning in, if anyone makes a connection to me – that’s amazing…All my life, I feel like I’m a competition winner. Like – how did I end up here?” Coughlan’s childhood in Galway was nothing like Derry Girls. She also had little in common with Clare, the anxious “wee lesbian” she plays. “I had these grand notions that I wanted to go off and be an actor… I was always roping my friends into making my own movies and plays.” She scored her first job at age nine, as “Little Girl Feeding Swans” in an action thriller named My Brother’s War. She would have abandoned school right then, had her parents entertained the notion; as it was, Coughlan went on to do a foundation course at Oxford School of Drama before finally starting at Birmingham School of Acting. In acting, she found an effortless, obvious outlet for her lifelong exuberance and sensitivity. “It fed my soul. It just felt so right… Like when people meet their soulmate: you just know.” But she was not prepared for the reality of being an actor. Just before graduating in 2011, students were made to come up with a “business plan” for acting success. It was a sobering moment for Coughlan, then 24. “I remember looking at it like: ‘This is bollocks, this makes no sense.’ I don’t come from money; I have to work a full-time job; how do I go to an audition with a full-time job? All of it hit me.” The years after drama school were “horrific”, Coughlan says, a test of not just her love for acting, but her livelihood. For nearly a year, she did not audition at all. “I was desperately trying to be proactive, but it’s just oversubscribed.” With the odds against her, she fell into depression. “It was horrendous. I was in a really bad place. There’s a lot put on people to make it overnight, and Derry Girls, in a sense, was an overnight success – but I’d got my first job at nine years old,” she says. “It was really a long time for me.” In four years, Coughlan moved to London three times, then back in with her parents in Galway. “I just felt like the worst failure in the world, like I’d wasted time. I was pitying myself: ‘Why did you think you could do this?’” She had no savings, and often no money. “That’s not an exaggeration: my bank account was dry.” She was also in debt, having taken out a loan to pay for drama school. “I say all the time: ‘Yes, money doesn’t make you happy’ – but unless you’ve been really broke, you don’t know the stress, how it takes up all of your time, and sucks the joy,” says Coughlan. “I still get scared to check my bank account, I still have that fear in me. It’s not that long ago that I couldn’t afford a cup of coffee.” She found a job working two days a week at an optician’s and remained there for 18 months, practising her autograph on appointment letters. Her break, when it came, could not have been more serendipitous: she responded to an open casting call posted on Twitter, then landed the part of Jess in Jess and Joe Forever at the Old Vic. Coughlan’s colleagues at the opticians farewelled her with macarons, prosecco and a card reading “Goodbye and Good Luck”. “I remember saying to myself: I’m never going to have a normal job again,” says Coughlan. She still refers to a photo from her last day at the opticians as a reminder of how far she’s come. As sliding-door moments go, she knows that she just slipped through. “It’s so rare that someone actually gets to do this as a job… Everything I’m ever doing, I think: ‘Imagine if that hadn’t happened.’” Five years later, Coughlan has two hit shows and transatlantic name recognition. Derry Girls was a surprise hit for Netflix in the US, with no marketing and hyper-local humour – proof, to Coughlan, of a universal truth: “that teenage girls can be fucking hilarious”. Now, Coughlan’s celebrity sheen – one of Vogue’s best-dressed women of 2021, with an access most-areas pass in Hollywood – is tempered by her novelty as a “small Irish acting person”, to quote her Twitter bio. She’s easy to root for as the gal from Galway, infiltrating the A-list. She tells me about crashing Elton John’s Oscars party in February 2020, hosted by Van Ness. “We took our own pictures on the red carpet because no one was gonna take pictures of us… We were pissing ourselves laughing, like this is the funniest thing. I compare it to being like that really old aunt at a wedding, who’s very happy to get an invite.” But as excitable as Coughlan is about others’ celebrity, she is more ambivalent about her own. She recently likened the experience of being famous to being a dog on the Tube. She has “an important addendum” when I bring it up now: “Some people hate dogs.” The sheer size of her following has forced her to revisit her relationship with social media. Last month, Coughlan posted a mirror selfie to Instagram and Twitter, above a heartfelt request: “If you have an opinion about my body please, please don’t share it with me… It’s really hard to take the weight of thousands of opinions on how you look being sent directly to you every day.” Coughlan had considered the post for a while, she says, motivated not so much by criticism of her appearance, but by the scrutiny. “I’m not naive enough to think I can change trolls; it was more people just offering comments that they felt were fine. But, actually, that’s worse to me.” She’s reluctant to share specifics, if only so as not to extend the hurt. “It’s just the language that’s used around women’s bodies – words have meaning. If you’re saying specific things about how someone looks, you can say, ‘This is just a word’ – sure, but it’s not to me.” Her post was friendly and firm, with comments turned off so as to make clear she was not inviting a dialogue – and Coughlan says she has noticed the difference in discussion since. But it is telling that her polite request for respect was written up as a celebrity clapback, and her boundaries ignored to make a broader point about body positivity. Coughlan’s mum saw the headlines and called her, concerned her daughter was under siege. “Like, ‘She slams critics! She drops the mic! Thank you for speaking out!’ – but no,” says Coughlan, “that was literally, selfishly about me as a human… It was misconstrued by a lot of people as me ‘taking down the haters’. Nope: this is me trying to tell you directly how I feel. I don’t mean it in a mean way; I’m just saying I would prefer this way going forward.” It is not the first time in Coughlan’s relatively short career that she has had to counter scrutiny of her body: in 2018, she sought (and received) an apology from the British Theatre Guide over its male critic’s attention to her weight. But, though she is an active feminist, she is wary of being painted as a trailblazer of body positivity. Her wish, Coughlan says, is for attention to be focused on her acting. “I don’t want people to think that they own that part of me,” she says. “If I want to turn around and become a hench-ass bodybuilder, if I want to shave my head or cover myself in tattoos, I’m going to do that… If I had a role to play, like, an Olympic gymnast, I will alter my body for that part, if that’s the part I want to play.” She’s likewise stepped back from Twitter, finding herself “bored by the lack of nuance” and “sanctimonious responses to jokes.” She likens social media to a classroom of kids, joking around, jostling for popularity. “When you become a known person, you’re like the weird teacher saying, ‘I’m still in on the joke!’ And they go: ‘You’re not any more. Actually, all this stuff is wrong with you.’ Most people are not trying to be cruel, and I would hate to completely shut down that dialogue. But your mental health has to come first.” It reflects Coughlan’s reckoning with her new status as an insider, not an everywoman – of coming to terms with her cachet and considering how to spend it. She takes none of it for granted, though Bridgerton has been confirmed for at least two further series. “I’ve heard young actors talk about buying sports cars and I just think, ‘Oh Jesus Christ please don’t.’ You just think: nothing is guaranteed.” She models herself after Judi Dench, who’s said she’s just glad to still be working. Coughlan is even grateful, now, for her slow start. “I’ve seen it go the other way, where people get amazing opportunities really young and they are full, wide awake nightmares” – which returns us to her naughty list. “There’s lots of terrible people, of course,” she says, cheerily. Name me one, I say. Coughlan pauses, and for a moment – convinced that she’s a competition winner and I’m her best friend – I think she will. Then she affects a lofty voice and regal bearing, befitting of Lady Whistledown. “They will out themselves in time,” she declares, nose comically upturned. “I hope. I hope and pray.” Then she dissolves into giggles.

2/27/2022,"There is no official smoking area at Twickenham. The organisers are very clear on this point. Smoking and vaping is strictly prohibited in all areas of the ground, enforced by hundreds of stern-looking signs with a handy reminder on the back of your ticket. Unofficially, of course, everyone knows that the smokers congregate near Gates D and F by the green perimeter fence, and no lackey in an orange bib is going to offer a word of demurral. And so it is that at half-time in this taut, gripping game the corners of the ground are thick with the fug of cigarettes, as hundreds of fans merrily puff themselves a little closer to death. But then, Twickenham is that sort of place: a world governed by tacit conventions and innumerable contradictions. A place built by old money and yet in thrall to the new. A place that likes to think of itself as the home of rugby but which in reality represents a single narrow sliver of it. A place where sport is the draw but socialising is the real heart of its appeal. An 82,000-capacity arena with the feel of a little English village. That duality was evident a few minutes before kick-off, when – in common with many sporting venues around the country this weekend – a message flashed up on the big screen announcing that both teams “strongly condemned” the war in Ukraine. The players linked arms and there was warm applause around the ground: a sober atmosphere for sobering times, and an entirely understandable gesture by the Rugby Football Union in the current climate. Of course, there was a good deal less fanfare for another event held at Twickenham just a few weeks ago, when the stadium hosted the International Armoured Vehicles Conference, one of the leading global arms fairs. Military personnel from all over the world descended on the home of English rugby to hear talks and browse hardware from a plethora of international defence companies, many of whom had signed lucrative contracts to carry out work for Russia in the past. Now Twickenham solemnly rose to condemn war, a reminder that as ever in the shapeshifting corridors of the British establishment, two things can always be true at once. Perhaps the gravity of events in Ukraine, the vague dissonance between this harmless sporting sublimation of war and the real thing taking place on the other edge of the continent, dampened the mood a little early on. But there were other factors at work here too. As England grizzled and grappled their way to an unsatisfying 12-0 half-time lead, the first post-pandemic Six Nations game at Twickenham with a full crowd felt a little damp, a little edgy, a little unconsummated. This is still, for all the returning green shoots of life, a country bearing the scars of a national trauma, in a sense relearning how to be among others after two years that have essentially been defined by mutual suspicion, mediated through the thickness of a screen. The rawness of live sport, particularly an intimate contact sport like rugby, can still feel a little shocking up close. But as a tepid first half gave way to a stirring second, as Twickenham finally found its voice, it also felt like a healing of sorts. This has always been one of the question marks over Eddie Jones’s England, who for all their fitful progress over the last six years have occasionally struggled to forge a connection with its paying audience. Tickets for this game started at £67 and went all the way up to £172: steep, if largely in line with the going market rate. But this is a sporting choice as well as a financial one: in common with many big event crowds these days, rising ticket prices have created an increasingly transactional relationship between teams and their consumers, on in which the players are broadly in the service of the audience, rather than the other way round. At Twickenham, this is most evident in the slightly conditional investment of the crowd in a game’s early stages. The noise does not hit you like a steam train from the first minute like it does at Cardiff or Dublin. Instead, the crowd withholds the full force of its fervour until it sees something it deems worthy of it. It demands to be moved. Come on. Give us something. In the meantime, we’re going to sip on our pints and see how things go. But as England fought off a daring Wales fightback in the second half, Twickenham finally got what it came for. The first half had been bitty and scrappy, lots of dead air and roads to nowhere. Then Josh Adams and Nick Tompkins and then Kieran Hardy in the dying minutes cut England’s lead to a smidgin, and England’s pack rose to their task. The dynamic Marcus Smith, a delightful street magician of a player, continued to create, to make gaps and find them. And so, amid a ferocious climactic din, England prevailed. It may have been an imperfect victory, the most insignificant of triumphs in a game taking place in the foothills of a grim foreign war. But to watch the sun setting behind the West Stand on a glorious evening, with Smith leading England to victory and the smokers nipping off for their full-time fags, was to partake in the communion of life’s smaller pleasures.",Sport/Sport,England finally answer call to arms against Wales on difficult day | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/27/england-finally-answer-call-to-arms-against-wales-on-difficult-day
2/27/2022,"As with so many of cinema’s most successful practitioners, the South Africa-born British film-maker Roger Michell, who died last September aged 65, was not an “auteur” with a singular distinctive style. On the contrary, he was a versatile craftsman who could turn his hand to a range of genres with ease. From the classic Richard Curtis romcom Notting Hill to the American thriller Changing Lanes and the deliciously twisty Daphne du Maurier dark romance My Cousin Rachel, Michell instinctively understood the differing demands of each story he was telling. He adapted Hanif Kureishi’s The Buddha of Suburbia for TV with great success, gave Anne Reid her finest role in the taboo-breaking, Kureishi-scripted drama The Mother, and directed a sorely underrated screen adaptation of Ian McEwan’s Enduring Love, the bravura opening movement of which has haunted me for years. Michell’s documentary about the Queen, Elizabeth: A Portrait in Parts, comes to cinemas and streaming in June. Meanwhile, his last dramatic feature film, The Duke, is finally getting a belated cinema release following Covid-related delays. It’s an extremely likable crime-caper comedy that owes a tonal debt to such Charles Crichton classics as Hue and Cry and The Lavender Hill Mob – good-natured British romps that helped to turn Ealing Studios into one of the nation’s most revered institutions. The fact that The Duke is based on a true story just accentuates its sense of homegrown eccentricity. Jim Broadbent, who cut an impressively tragicomic figure in Michell’s bittersweet old-age/New Wave charmer Le Week-end (2013), plays Kempton Bunton, a real-life figure who achieved notoriety in the mid-60s after the theft of Goya’s portrait of the Duke of Wellington from the National Gallery. We meet Bunton in the dock in London, pleading not guilty to pilfering said painting, of which he was never a fan (“It’s not very good, is it?”). From here we spiral back to Newcastle in the spring of 1961, where the retired bus driver and self-proclaimed Robin Hood figure has felt the long arm of the law for refusing to pay his TV licence fee. Outraged that public money is being spent to keep a “half-baked portrait by some Spanish drunk” in the UK, habitual soap-boxer Bunton declares that the money would be better spent on “war widows and pensioners… for the greater good of mankind”. When the Goya goes awol, the authorities suspect highly organised international criminals, probably including “a trained commando” (the 1962 Bond film Dr No fancifully placed the painting in its villain’s lair). But when Kempton’s long-suffering wife, Dorothy (Helen Mirren), finds “a stolen masterpiece in me wardrobe!”, it appears that her husband has outdone himself in his quest to battle social injustice at large while driving his nearest and dearest to distraction at home. Bunton’s stranger-than-fiction story has been dramatised before, most notably in David Spicer’s 2015 BBC radio play Kempton and the Duke. The well-crafted script for Michell’s film is co-written by Richard Bean and Clive Coleman, the latter of whom served as legal correspondent for the BBC. All of which makes it doubly ironic that a central theme of The Duke is Bunton’s staunch BBC refusenik status and his campaign against the licence fee for pensioners, something that has become all the more timely since the film premiered at Venice in September 2020. In last week’s Observer, Broadbent noted that “now Kempton would be defending the BBC to the hilt against these wicked people trying to dismantle it by foul means. He’d have switched sides.” As for The Duke, it’s jovially neutral fare, preferring to frame its story as an unashamedly old-fashioned underdog tale – an absurdist struggle of the little man against monolithic bureaucracy. Broadbent is terrific in the lead, investing his bumbling antihero with a winning blend of fearlessness and foolishness even as the film tips from social satire into theatrical silliness. Plaudits to Mirren, too, for turning exasperation into an art form, ensuring that while The Duke is never quite as surprising as the case that inspired it, it nonetheless retains a much-needed astringent streak.",Arts/Film,The Duke review – Jim Broadbent excels in true tale of ​art-stealing pensioner,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/27/the-duke-review-roger-michell-jim-broadbent-helen-mirren-kempton-bunton-theft
2/27/2022,"Momtaza Mehri is a poet and essayist and was Young People’s Poet Laureate for London in 2018. Her work has appeared in Vogue, Granta, Poetry International, and elsewhere A white lotus bears too much meaning. In Buddhist tradition, lotuses represent spiritual purification and supreme enlightenment. Nirvana is especially elusive in The White Lotus, HBO’s latest stinging satire set in the tropical confines of a Hawaiian resort. The show is populated by a bevy of affluent holidaymakers whose worst impulses are activated by too much sun, sand and suspicion. At first, we are thrown into the aftermath of a whodunnit and its attendant cargo labelled “Human Remains”. Tragedy unfurls in reverse as bouncy newlyweds Shane (Jake Lacy) and Rachel (Alexandra Daddario) arrive at the White Lotus resort with a soon-to-be-dampened enthusiasm. Alongside them, we meet the Mossbachers, a family unit headed by high-powered search engine CFO Nicole (Connie Britton), her hypochondriac husband, Mark (Steve Zahn), her artfully unimpressed daughter, Olivia, and withdrawn son, Quinn. Olivia’s college friend Paula – another source of bored vocal fry and quips – joins them. Jennifer Coolidge is distinctively raspy as Tanya, a dazed, alcoholic grappling with her mother’s recent death. Murray Bartlett oversees all as the deliciously erratic Aussie hotel manager, Armond, attending to the countless whims of guests even as he teeters on the edge of a breakdown. Creator Mike White narrows the sphere of action. Barbs are thrown and anxieties soon flare. Nicole tries to snatch some family time amid Zoom meetings with Chinese backers while her husband faces a cancer scare. His health woes reveal a family history that unsettles his perceptions of masculinity and fatherhood. Like sunscreen slapped on skin, secrets lubricate the atmosphere. Meanwhile, Shane is provoked by the first, and most irksome, snag troubling the picturesque honeymoon booked by his mother. Instead of the Pineapple Suite with its famed plunge pool, the loved-up couple are forced to make do with the Palm Suite instead. Armond won’t admit to a double-booking slip, triggering a cat-and-mouse obsession between him and an increasingly wrathful Shane. The Pineapple Suite becomes a totemic object, revealing the couple’s serious incompatibilities and mismatched priorities. Rachel sees a side of her husband she may have been able to previously, or conveniently, ignore. Her marriage ensures she won’t have to work a day in her life if she so pleases, a suggestion Shane encourages. After all, his own mother is one such lady of leisure. Even in comfort, claustrophobia threatens this leafy idyll. Tanya’s quest for a grief-relieving massage lands her in the hands of Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), the resort’s capable spa manager. Belinda is exceedingly patient, which quickly makes her captive to Tanya’s self-pity. With unwitting cruelty, Tanya dangles a life-changing offer - she will fund Belinda’s dream wellness centre just because. At the first distraction, Tanya shoots down the sense of hope she inspired. There lies the rub - the resort’s poolside proletariat must also cater to the psychodramas and fantasies of their rich guests. Tight grins stretch the faces of workers who hide pregnancies on the job while micromanaging the wealthy’s needs. “You have to treat these people like sensitive children,” pill-popping Armond reminds his staff. Anyone who has ever toiled in hospitality will probably wince throughout The White Lotus. Relations are equally murky between the guests. Generational conflicts are staged over exotic fruit platters as Olivia and Paula tag-team the middle aged into ideological submission, while the younger Quinn wastes away in incel-adjacent detachment. The show’s writers use Olivia and Paula as mouthpieces for a jaded contrarianism, skewering the zeitgeist’s speech patterns. They make sure Nicole hears them calling Hillary Clinton a neoliberal warhawk. Conviction is besides the point when you just want to piss off your old-hat liberal parents. Though such psychological warfare is fun to watch, it clumsily lifts too much from social media’s hinterlands of mutating terminologies and context-specific discourses. As the young would say, it tries too hard. Elsewhere, Rachel struggles to make the leap from the listicle ghetto to serious reportage. Her dreams curdle, especially after a brutal encounter with Nicole, who is her self-actualised feminist role model. In his Letters from Hawaii, Mark Twain described Maui as a place devoid of “trouble or sorrow or weariness”. The White Lotus portrays the same island as a heat sink of high-end ennui and class rage. Six episodes are enough to make you feel like you have overstayed your welcome. It’s a breezy romp that points to the future of pandemic television’s fishbowl urgency. A concept delivered during lockdown, it makes use of evocative location and compact plotting as an incubator for peril, inequality and racial stratification. By the end of the trip, only Quinn is renewed. He comes out of his shell, leaving behind his soggy mattress to hit the waves with his new local friends. Someone’s hell is someone else’s paradise. Amid the inane chatter, perhaps that’s the only dharmic wisdom to be gleaned.",Arts/Culture,Observer/Anthony Burgess prize for arts journalism 2022: Momtaza Mehri on The White Lotus,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/27/observeranthony-burgess-prize-for-arts-journalism-2022-momtaza-mehri-on-the-white-lotus
2/27/2022,"With its torrents of blood, animal howling, vagina hilarity and creepy relish in terms such as “cord prolapse”, “ovarian torsion”, “placental abruption”, the television adaptation of Adam Kay’s This Is Going to Hurt has not pleased everyone. Yet if some of us were unlikely to enjoy pleasantries such as Kay’s “same shit, different vagina”, with others finding its scenes of chaotic maternity staff and mashed innards actively disturbing, you could also see this ugliness as a potentially helpful corrective to enduring, often officially encouraged myths about the desirability of all-natural deliveries. This tendency probably contributed to tragedies like those at first hushed up at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust. Only the intervention of bereaved mothers, as the BBC’s Panorama has reported, brought the hospital’s avoidable fatalities to light. The senior midwife, Donna Ockenden, who will soon publish her final report on the scandal, has previously told Panorama about the maternity unit’s pride in its low-intervention births. “Low caesarean section rates were a prize.” Added to this, and to the many personal accounts that followed the NHS’s recent recognition – after it coerced countless women into compliance with its caesarian-avoidance targets – that “normal” childbirth can be deeply unsafe, unpredictable and terrifying, Kay’s misogynistic capers may even be well timed to educate another body of influential officials. The Law Commission would still prefer, judging by its proposals for facilitating surrogacy in the UK, to see childbirth as a routine if occasionally risky procedure after which, to the convenience of all involved, compliant female participants can be expected to emerge intact. You could easily take these lawyers for loyal students of the late childbirth guru, Sheila Kitzinger, with her mantra that pregnancy is not an illness, were it not that her related precepts on euphoric delivery might conflict with their own project for more numerous and efficient baby handovers. To this end, the Law Commission has proposed, in defiance of a UN rapporteur’s 2018 warnings about baby-trafficking, that surrogacy clients should become the baby’s official parents prior to birth. Two weeks, they estimate, would be enough, afterwards, to allow the birth mother to change her mind. Such mind-changing in surrogacy is far from rare, to go by figures reported by Ukraine’s Ministry of Justice, but, as with so much about surrogacy, there is no reliable data. The Law Commission’s confidence in British arrangements appears largely based on one small study of local altruistic surrogacy likely to be unrepresentative of any new, paying version. Later this year, the commission will publish recommendations informed by wider consultation, though affirmation might be a better word, given this body’s apparent fondness for contributions from parties with a known emotional or professional investment in the industry. In contrast, the lawyers awarded eight pages out of more than 450 to ethical objections to, for instance, the instrumentalising of female bodies and the coercion of poor women. An almost Europe-wide ban on the practice was likewise disregarded. Instead, entitling their consultation paper Building Families Through Surrogacy, the lawyers begin: “As society changes, surrogacy is becoming more common.” So, you might argue, is online fraud. Even given the tendentious claim that “surrogacy is an accepted form of building a family”, the commission had to acknowledge that it has been imperfectly applied to the point that exploitation of women in Thailand, Nepal and India led to its prohibition. And although they wrote before Covid and, now, the Russian war on Ukraine exposed more extreme risks of cross-border surrogacy, the commissioners, visiting Ukraine, were witness to dehumanising practices the industry doesn’t bother to conceal. Prospective parents will receive, for instance, this account of Ukraine’s breeding attractions from a thriving outfit called Growing Families: “Surrogate mothers tend to come from lower social classes, yet live in clean and modern homes and be [sic] employed.” As Russia invades, there are estimated to be hundreds of Ukrainian surrogate mothers carrying foreigners’ babies. In one of many news reports dwelling on the feelings of intending parents, the director of Growing Families has shared his concern for clients “desperate to get their embryos out of Ukraine”. But what might appear compelling reasons to reconsider surrogacy will only strike its advocates – or UK law commissioners – as another reason to enhance the domestic offer. In the UK, it is argued, the business of female incubation can be better regulated. Age-wise, for instance, the commissioners suggest that 18 is quite old enough for a woman to market her womb to more affluent consumers – or to have this done for her by a better-paid professional. There is no proposed need for an existing child, no maximum number of pregnancies. “We are concerned,” they explain, “not to discourage people.” What if a surrogate (the commissioners dislike adding the word mother) is left not just permanently changed, but physically or mentally impaired by childbirth? Infertile? Dead? In a section on compensation whose very blandness is more offensive than any contribution from Adam Kay, the commissioners accept that the sort of hazards depicted in This Is Going to Hurt could damage, even kill, its UK surrogacy recruits. Like surrogacy’s paying clients, they clearly considered that women’s injuries and the occasional hysterectomy or death could be a price worth paying for this inessential service. As the UN’s rapporteur said, warning about the sale of babies, “there is no right to have a child under international law”. It’s a few months until the law commissioners are due to publish recommendations. Even if they remain determined to trivialise ethical concerns reflected in the almost Europe-wide prohibition of surrogacy, to disregard heartbreaking case histories and classify other “feminist” objections as therefore marginal, they still have time to watch Ben Whishaw shout, over another malfunctioning female body: “I can’t do this, this woman’s going to die and it’s all my fault.” It could, so to speak, be them.

2/27/2022,"Eight months before she took her own life, Abigail Patterson, 29, was brutally assaulted by her partner, Robert Holiday. She had suffered five years of violence and on this occasion, received a fractured cheekbone, bruising and a head wound. Holiday – who was already subject to a suspended sentence for assaulting her – also damaged furniture in her house and cut up her clothes. In March last year, Judge Mark Bury told Holiday, before sentencing him for assault causing actual bodily harm and damage to property: “She [Patterson] was left in a lot of pain. She couldn’t eat properly and needed help with washing and dressing. She was worn down by you.” Judge Bury continued: “It is clear the family blame you for her death and her mental health had deteriorated since the last assault and they may well be right, but you have not been charged in a way that allows you to be blamed for her death.” Holiday was sentenced to two and a half years. He will be out in half that time. The causes of suicide are complex. Nevertheless, in France, since 2020, if domestic abuse is a prominent factor, the perpetrator can expect a sentence of up to 10 years and a fine of €150,000. No such law exists in the UK. In 2013, Karen Blatchford, unaided, began counting women who had taken their own lives after experiencing male violence, some abused by more than one partner, recording each woman on Twitter @we_are_nina (not invisible not alone). Now she is calling for these deaths to be officially counted. The extent of domestic abuse (DA) related suicide, and hidden homicides that include, for instance, “accidents” and femicides that pass as suicides, is only now beginning to emerge because of the work of campaigners such as the charity Advocacy After Fatal Domestic Abuse (AAFDA). Clarrie O’Callaghan and Karen Ingala Smith, co-founders of the annual Femicide Census, with whom the Observer has been working on its End Femicide series, advocate that better data is vital. Now a new campaign called #notjustanother (…mother, sister, daughter, friend…) has been launched, founded by criminologist Professor Jane Monckton-Smith. In the run-up to the anniversary of Sarah Everard’s killing on 3 March, MPs will receive a letter signed by more than 330 organisations, charities, individuals and bereaved families. Among its demands is a call for police to treat all sudden, unexpected deaths of those known to be victims of domestic abuse as potential femicide from the outset, securing the scene. A Home Office report, published in 2015 looked at 32 unexpected deaths that the police had decided were not suspicious and were subsequently re-examined by forensic pathologists. Ten transpired to be killings and a further five were suspicious and required further investigation – almost 50%. The #notjustanother campaign is also asking that, in addition to a national count of women killed by men in domestic femicides, published annually (as Karen Ingala Smith has done informally on her website Counting Dead Women), the numbers of women who have died in unexplained circumstances and domestic abuse related suicides are also collated. “We are always being asked for the evidence base for demanding change,” Monckton-Smith says. “This campaign is about providing the data that we need.” The full extent of domestic abuse related suicide is unknown but the little that has been established is chilling. “We know enough to know that we should be seriously concerned,” says one researcher. In 2004, data from Prof Sylvia Walby estimated that one in eight of all female suicides and suicide attempts in the UK are due to domestic violence and abuse. This equates to 200 women taking their own lives a year; nearly 30 women attempting DA related suicide every day. More recently, a Home Office and police study of the first year of the pandemic, April 2020-March 2021, detailed 38 domestic abuse related suicides, a likely underestimate as only those with a reported history of abuse to police were included. The majority were aged under 45 and 90% were female. In a recently published paper, co-written by Monckton-Smith, Susan Haile, Hannana Siddiqui and Dr Alexandra Sandham, an eight-stage homicide timeline is described based on 400 cases: it tracks a new way of assessing risk in a coercive and controlling relationship. The paper also includes a timeline for domestic abuse and “honour” killing-related suicides, especially high in the south Asian community. In all deaths, except arranged marriages, the relationship escalates into “love” rapidly and by stage three has moved to coercive and controlling behaviour that builds an invisible prison around the isolated woman, stripping her of liberty, choice and the person she was. Abigail Patterson blamed herself for Holiday’s behaviour. The suicide timeline differs from that of homicide at stage four. A woman discloses her abuse usually to family or a friend. Stage five, she seeks help and fails to find it – not least because support services are vastly overstretched and underfunded. Drug and alcohol use may become a way of coping with her situation and is diagnosed by agencies, disregarding the abuse at the core. A sense of entrapment is followed by suicide ideation sometimes encouraged by the abuser. The paper quotes one case, “There were 10,000 messages from him in one month. He would say things like: ‘Go suicide yourself, you c***.’” “To a woman in those circumstances, the only escape appears to be to end her own life,” Monckton-Smith says. “She has been failed by the system. Opportunities for intervention, risk assessment and prevention have been fatally missed.” The homicide timelines have been described in Monckton-Smith’s book, In Control: Dangerous Relationships and How They End in Murder, 1,000 copies of which have been donated by the publisher, Bloomsbury, and will be sent to every MP as part of the campaign. “We rightly risk assess perpetrators,” says Sarah Dangar, a domestic abuse consultant. “But for some women suffering horrendous abuse we should also be considering the risk they might pose to themselves. That’s a responsibility not just of the police, but for GPs and drug, alcohol and mental health services too. That rarely happens.” Dangar is working alongside AAFDA and Prof Vanessa Munro on a project for the Home Office, examining the domestic homicide reviews (DHRs) of 30 domestic abuse related suicides. DHRs examine what lessons need to be learned to prevent future deaths. Only since 2016 has it been an obligation to conduct a DHR where “a victim took their own life and the circumstances give rise to concern”. “In many cases, women do everything they can to manage their own and their children’s risk but the mother rather than the perpetrator is seen as failing by agencies and the children are removed,” Dangar says. “A good domestic homicide review can tell the children, when they are at an age to read it, that they weren’t abandoned. Their mother fought hard for them and she did not get the help she needed. “Coroners now record if a person is a veteran when there is a suicide so we can start counting,” Dangar adds. “Why don’t they dig deeper and record if domestic abuse is present in a woman’s suicide? Once we have the evidence base of the extent of the problem – and the indications are that it is significant – we can push harder for a criminal justice, public health and suicide prevention response. This is preventable.” Hannana Siddiqui of Southall Black Sisters would also like a duty placed on coroners to automatically record gender and ethnicity as well as domestic abuse. “We need a better understanding of the extra barriers and motivations for racially minoritised women. Even when a woman takes her own life for the honour of the family if abuse is involved that is itself a form of cultural coercive control. Without the data, we don’t have that extra dimension.” Frank Mullane, the founder of AAFDA, points out that coroners can now conclude unlawful killing and suicide on “the balance of probabilities” (formerly, the test was “beyond reasonable doubt”). “If a coroner decides that a death was both a suicide and an unlawful killing that may lead to families pursuing prosecutions and civil claims.” Eleanor Stobart is a highly regarded chair of domestic homicide reviews who has steered more than 25 over the past nine years. “If a person kills themselves in the presence of another that ought to be a red flag. A lot of DHRs fail to record the racism and misogyny. In one case, a woman was constantly stalked and told by professionals to take a different route to nursery every day. The perpetrator breached a restraining order three times and received a suspended sentence each time. She was too frightened to leave her house. Her child was taken away. The entire narrative became about her alleged agoraphobia and personality disorder, not his abuse.” In another case, described by a fellow DHR chair, paramedics found a woman alive, took her to hospital and instructed neighbours to clear up before the children came home. The woman subsequently died and all evidence was lost. In another, a woman had documented her abuse in a diary and laptop given to her by her sister. After her suicide, the perpetrator removed both. Perpetrators of abuse may go on to harass and threaten surviving members of the family; the fear continues. In 2006, the first attempt to convict a perpetrator of contributing to his wife’s suicide failed. Harcharran Dhaliwal was accused of the manslaughter of his wife, Gurjit, 45, and inflicting grievous bodily harm on her. She had documented numerous incidents of physical and psychological abuse. “How can there be so much evidence and yet no punishment for taking my sister’s life?” asked Nav Jagpal, Gurjit’s brother. Justene Reece, 46, was subjected to harassment and abuse by Nicholas Allen, 47, from September 2016 to February 2017. Allen made 3,500 attempts to contact Reece via calls, texts and social media messages. He had convictions for violently abusing women going back to 1998. After Reece took her own life, Allen was jailed for 10 years, and a further five years on licence. He was initially charged with coercive behaviour and stalking. Later, the Crown Prosecution Service brought a charge of unlawful killing – believed to be a legal first. In the five years since Reece’s conviction, a charge of unlawful killing in a domestic abuse related suicide has proved rare to nonexistent. Why? Police have proposed that coercive control legislation could be used more frequently to hold perpetrators to account for domestic abuse related suicides. However, the maximum penalty for a coercive control offence is only five years. In August 2018, mother of three Kellie Sutton, 30, attempted to take her own life and died three days later. Her partner, Steven Gane, 31, was subsequently convicted of controlling and coercive behaviour, actual bodily harm and assault. Judge Philip Grey said: “Your behaviour drove Kellie Sutton to hang herself … you beat her and ground her down and broke her spirits.” Gane was jailed for a mere four years and three months. Two years ago, AAFDA was supporting 18 families who believed a relative had taken their lives as a result of domestic related abuse or femicide that had been disguised as suicide: now it is 100. AAFDA is now working with the National Police Chiefs’ Council to improve the police response to DA related suicide. What else needs to be done? Over the past two years, Kent and Medway Suicide Prevention Network has undertaken research indicating that, in its area, an alarming 20% to 25% of deaths by suicide have been affected by domestic abuse. Local police now dig deeper if there has been a sudden unexpected death, for instance, asking friends and family about domestic abuse while training has been improved for agencies that may come in contact with a vulnerable woman. What’s striking is that this is far from common practice. After a highly critical report on the responses of police forces to violence against women and girls, revealing that three out of four DA offences are dropped, deputy chief constable Maggie Blyth has been appointed the first national police coordinator for violence against women and girls. She has promised to rebuild trust and oversee “a fundamental shift in priority for violence against women and girls”, including “a consistently high standard of service” for victims. Each police force will deliver a local action plan on 31 March. In addition, there are calls for a national working group made up of all agencies to accelerate action. Dr Gemma Graham was six years old when her mother took her own life after experiencing domestic abuse. Graham is one of the #notjustanother organising team. “My mum never got the recognition or support she deserved,” she says. “No one should live in fear for their own lives or their children’s. We are asking for an official annual count because more must be done – these women matter.” Advocacy After Fatal Domestic Abuse: help@aafda.org.uk, phone 07768 386922 Samaritans: Jo@samaritans.org.uk, phone 116123 Refuge: nationaldahelpline.org.uk (live chat) phone 0808 2000247",News/Society,Suicide by domestic violence: call to count the hidden toll of women’s lives,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/27/suicide-by-domestic-violence-call-to-count-the-hidden-toll-of-womens-lives
2/27/2022,"The Femicide Census usually reports on women killed by men annually, but we had incomplete data from 2019, which continued into 2020 and beyond, largely due to the pandemic’s impact on the court system. We’re finally publishing the findings for each of those years this weekend. It may seem surprising that during a time when men’s violence against women led mainstream news for a while, we recorded two consecutive years of falls in the numbers of women killed by men. In fact, 2020 finds the lowest numbers of women killed by men since our records began in 2009. This is largely driven by a reduction in the number of women recorded as killed by current or former partners. For the 10 years ending in 2018 on average, 89 women (62% of all women killed by men) were killed by current or former partners every year. In 2019 this was 65 women (51% of all women killed by men) and in 2020, the number was 57 women (51% of all women killed by men). We know, thanks to Karen Ingala Smith’s project Counting Dead Women, that the number of women killed by a male suspect increases again in 2021 to 141, higher than the number of women killed in 2019 and 2020. We must therefore ask what happened in 2021 that could have a discernible impact and how should that inform policy-makers, particularly around support for women in relationships with violent men. At the end of March 2020, the country went into lockdown in response to Covid. During the first week , 10 women were killed by men in the UK. Between April and June 2020, there was a 65% increase in calls to the National Domestic Abuse Helpline, when compared with the first three months of the year. So, we saw increased reporting of domestic abuse but by the end of the year, a fall in the number of women killed by partners or ex-partners compared with what we usually see. The Femicide Census has consistently shown that separation is a risk factor for intimate-partner femicides, or more accurately, a trigger for violent, abusive and/or controlling men. Between 2018 and 2019, on average 43% of all women killed by current or former partners had left or were in the process of leaving. We believe the real figures may be higher because women don’t always tell anyone that they’re planning to leave and it doesn’t always get reported in court. In fact, what is reported in court is often led by the accused killer’s defence narrative and he may give a very different picture about what was going on in the relationship, compared with his victim were she able to tell her side of the story. In 2020, evidence of separation was found in far fewer cases, reported in 37% of intimate-partner femicides. Looking at the numbers alone, this falls from an average of 38 a year to 21. Lockdown and the restrictions to movement made it more difficult for women to leave abusive men, instead they were often stuck with him. It is possible that this reduced the numbers of women killed by the men they were trying to leave. We believe our data shows that providing real and tangible pathways to safety for women leaving violent men is critical if the government is serious about protecting women from the most extreme outcomes of men’s violence. All too often the law seriously and fatally fails women who need to leave. Injunctions need robust enforcement for breach including the use of tags to monitor men so that women can stay in their homes; violence and abuse needs to result in appropriate sanctions so that men’s violence and attempts to coercively control never go unpunished; refuges need increased and sustainable funding so there is always space to go if women and their families have to leave; and the family court system needs to address men’s use and abuse of the system by enabling control through child contact and finances. Women should never feel that it is safer to stay with an abusive man than to leave him. If the government is serious about tackling violent men then the full force of measures already available, yet woefully funded and resourced, need to finally achieve the result they were designed for. They can work in many circumstances, but not all. When they fail, it is too often fatal.

2/27/2022,"Unless a miracle occurs, we are witnessing the destruction of Ukraine as a free and democratic state of 44 million citizens at the hands of a dictator. Vladimir Putin refers to Ukraine as “a dagger pointed at the heart of Russia” not because of any military threat it has ever posed to his country, but because of the values its form of governance represents. For the west, this is the biggest failure of statecraft and deterrence since 1939. No one in the UK government should be surprised at what has happened. I remember sitting round the table of the National Security Council in 2014 after Putin’s violent annexation of the Crimea, where we concluded that, in the light of this gross violation of international law, he would repeat such an action if given a chance. Yet in the eight years that have followed, we have failed entirely to craft an adequate response to Putin. Neither the recent British programme to train and engage with the Ukrainian military, nor the empty last-minute ministerial rhetoric challenging the Russian leader’s threats, can conceal the truth: that we have allowed Putin to conclude that the destruction of Ukraine comes at an affordable price. This failure is starkly illustrated by our attitude to Russian influence and corruption in the UK. The intelligence and security committee inquiry on Russia, whose open report the prime minister suppressed for nine months on an entirely bogus pretext, was presented with the clearest evidence that Russia saw no distinction between economic and state interests, and that it used elements of its diaspora in the UK to further its interests. Meanwhile, we tolerated their financial corruption, and encouraged the use of London as a centre to launder the proceeds. This in turn renders the ethical standards of our own society and politics liable to being undermined by the attractions of Russian money, and creates dependencies which cloud judgments. And we witnessed campaigns of disinformation, cybercrime and the targeting and assassination of opponents, as well as numerous criminal acts against other European partners. Yet our efforts to root out the corruption and sanction those with links to Putin have been woefully inadequate. In the light of what is now unfolding in Ukraine, they remain so, despite the recent announcements. To this we have to add the consequences of Brexit. The key actors in the response to this European crisis are our former EU partners every bit as much as the US. Yet our behaviour over Brexit damaged our standing, and fomented doubts that we will observe our binding engagements with them. We are no longer alongside them at the table, and have lost a leadership role in our near abroad. We were spectators to the Minsk process of engagement with Russia, led by France and Germany. We have made it harder for ourselves to persuade the EU states to exclude Russia from the Swift payment system. We have chosen to send warships and aircraft on a token visit to the Indo-Pacific when we scarcely have a credible deterrent in our own waters and airspace. It may now be too late to save Ukraine. But these events should be a wake-up call for us. Russia has to be treated as the enemy state it is. We may have decided that we cannot resist its current aggression by force, but we must – as a start – remove its influence domestically as we rebuild our damaged relations with the neighbours who share our values. That means freezing Russian assets in the UK and requiring any Russian citizen whose presence is not conducive to our public interest to leave. It means isolating ourselves so far as possible from commercial contact or dependency on Russians, accepting the economic downside this will inevitably entail, and setting an example to others to do likewise. This means working intensively with our allies before Putin’s next act of aggression follows our failure to check him today.

2/27/2022,"Peter Dutton has been criticised for setting up a GoFundMe page for a flood-affected Queensland community with one Labor MP suggesting it proved the Coalition was incompetent and couldn’t deliver commonwealth support. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said on Sunday evening he did “not understand” the backlash to the fundraiser set up by the defence minister for the Pine Rivers community in his electorate. “That sounds to me like someone doing their job,” Morrison said in Brisbane on Sunday evening when announcing commonwealth-state disaster payments for flood-affected communities. “As a local member of parliament, you always look to try and harness community support for responding to major disasters, that’s what our job is – to work with our communities when they’re in times of stress and times of need.” Labor frontbencher Josh Wilson suggested it reflected the government’s incompetence. “Tell me you have no idea what a competent government does without telling me you have no idea what a competent government does,” Wilson said on Twitter referencing the fundraiser. Tell me you have no idea what a competent government does without telling me you have no idea what a competent does. https://t.co/AHRSgmBRgQ Morrison commended Dutton “for what he’s doing” and insisted “I don’t understand the criticism”. “He is working with his community to add to the significant contributions that have been made by the commonwealth and the state and the local governments. He’s looking after his community. That’s what a good member for Dickson does.” But Tim wrote on Twitter: “Isn’t this the role of government? Y’know, the one you’re a part of.” Isn’t this the role of government? Y’know, the one you’re a part of In the fundraiser set up by Dutton, which had raised about $2,000 of its $25,000 goal on Sunday evening, the minister calls for support to provide “immediate financial assistance” to people in need. “The water hasn’t gone down yet, and we haven’t seen the full extent of the damage to our community due to catastrophic flooding,” Dutton said. “We have started a fundraiser to help local residents and businesses who have been affected. Every dollar donated will go directly to helping them.” Dutton said any amount donated to the cause would go towards residents and business owners in Pine Rivers whose lives and livelihoods were affected by the February 2022 floods. “Your donation will provide immediate assistance in the aftermath of the flood to those most in need,” the page states, including food and essential supply packages for families who need it, essential clean up supplies to assist community volunteers, equipment to help businesses get back up and running and “any other assistance we can provide the community”. But on Dutton’s own Facebook page people questioned why the federal government was not providing the direct financial assistance itself. The criticism comes amid an ongoing row between Labor and the government about the government’s disaster readiness – and particularly the $4.7bn emergency response fund. The fund was set up by the Coaltion in 2019 with the money to be spent on recovery and mitigation – but none of the fund has been allocated with the government referring to it as a fund of last resort. Labor has pledged to revamp the fund to direct $200m a year to disaster prevention and resilience, such as flood levees, sea walls, cyclone shelters, evacuation centres, fire breaks and telecommunications improvements. In the 2021 budget, the government announced a similar fund called the Prepare Australia fund, which committed $600m over six years for disaster resilience measures. Labor accused the government of continuing to sit on the emergency respone fund which had “done nothing to help” prepare the country for natural disasters. Morrison on Sunday said personal hardship assistance was being made available to flood-affected and evacuated communities in the Gympie and North Burnett areas. The assistance – of $180 for individuals and $900 for families – is provided through the joint commonwealth-state disaster recovery funding arrangements.",News/Australia news,‘Isn’t this the role of government?’: Peter Dutton panned for setting up fundraiser for flood victims ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/27/isnt-this-the-role-of-government-peter-dutton-panned-for-setting-up-fundraiser-for-flood-victims
