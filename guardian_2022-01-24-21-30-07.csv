1/24/2022,"The decision of the referee, Abigail Byrne, to allow play to continue after she diverted what the Arsenal manager, Jonas Eidevall, described as “one of the best passes of the game” out of the path of the intercepting run of Jordan Nobbs and into the feet of Manchester City forward Lauren Hemp was strange. Hemp went on a marauding run and delivered a cross for Khadija “Bunny” Shaw to tap in to give City the lead after 65 minutes. City had dominated but Arsenal were right to feel hard done by. True, the team in possession of the ball did not change by the official’s touch but the rules seem pretty clear: if the ball touches a match official, remains on the field of play and a team start a promising attack, then play must be restarted with a dropped ball. “The referees should be professional,” said Eidevall, “and should be given all the resources that they need to prepare and practice and work on fitness and that’s where we need to focus. Let’s raise the standard around refereeing and give them the help they need.” In the end Arsenal snatched an important point in the title race through Tobin Heath’s injury-time strike.

The game this weekend had a familiar feel to the one last season. Chelsea should have scored through Erin Cuthbert early in the game, but her shot pinged off the crossbar. Chances for Fran Kirby and Bethany England were deflected by the Brighton goalkeeper, Megan Walsh, who was playing with echoes of Tiane Endler. The Seagulls defensive efforts meant that despite Chelsea’s 26 shots at goal - with five on target - they left Broadfield Stadium with the game ending in a goalless draw. Brighton had lost their previous six games and the coach, Hope Powell, said: “What better way to end a bad run than against the reigning champions.” MN 🙌 @Megs1994 appreciation post 🙌How impressed were you with the Brighton keeper against @ChelseaFCW? 🧤 #BarclaysFAWSL @BHAFCWomen pic.twitter.com/TCnoKowBTz When all the chips fall your way it can be easy to settle. Manchester United’s 3-0 win against Tottenham on Sunday moved them into second place in the WSL and they stayed there as Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea all dropped points. The United manager, Marc Skinner, has worked wonders with the group of players at his disposal but now is the time for the board to back him and give him the resources during the the last few days of this transfer window to keep up the challenge for a place in next season’s Champions League and, whisper it, to vie for the league title. United coped without centre-back Millie Turner against Spurs but her potential long-term absence leaves the squad light and further injuries could derail the charge. “We’re working on [adding players],” said Skinner. “Our fans want it, we want it, but it’s got to be the right circumstances and the right people and, if not, then we work towards our team being the best version of themselves and they’re doing that.” SW It felt like the moment Birmingham could get the win needed to move off the bottom of the table. They went 2-0 up against Reading and Jade Pennock was terrorising the home side down the right. And then it all went wrong. Justine Vanhaevermaet pulled a goal back for Reading just before half-time and in the second half a clumsy foul led to the equaliser before Emma Harries won it for Kelly Chambers’ side. Birmingham lost their grip on the game after starting well and the manager, Darren Carter, knows that the defeat was of their own making. “I’m very frustrated, I can’t lie,” he said. “I thought we were excellent, up until the goal we conceded. Either side of half-time, we’ve shot ourselves in the foot, conceding before and conceding after.” RO A 𝒷 𝑒 𝒶 𝓊 𝓉 𝒾 𝒻 𝓊 𝓁 volley from @EHarries9 💫#BarclaysFAWSL @ReadingFCWomen pic.twitter.com/iL78QcALZ9 Everton will rue not taking their chances against West Ham with two efforts hitting the woodwork in the 3-0 defeat. Hanna Bennison aimed a wonderful right-footed strike towards goal but it was palmed onto the crossbar by Anna Leat in West Ham’s goal. The second attempt at 0-0 was even more frustrating as a header from Valerie Gauvin came off the underside of the bar. West Ham have not trailed for a single minute at home this season and with Everton failing to capitalise on a strong first half you can understand why they have scored only seven goals under Jean-Luc Vasseur, who succeeded Willie Kirk at the end of October.

Introducing Sunday afternoon’s relegation contenders Leicester and Aston Villa. The first came as early as the fourth minute from Leicester’s Jemma Purfield via a corner-kick scramble; no surprise given her team is one of the league’s worst away-goal conceders, with 36 conceded over the past two years. The Villa keeper Hannah Hampton then made Purfield feel better in the 76th minute with the second own goal of the game. It took a 94th-minute winner from the standout performer Alisha Lehmann to settle the game for Villa, very much in theme of their recent results.

1/24/2022,"The Liverpool bomber had an asylum claim rejected on multiple grounds six years before he attempted to detonate a homemade explosive outside a hospital, court documents show. Emad al-Swealmeen, 32, was killed when the bomb he was carrying exploded inside a taxi outside Liverpool women’s hospital on Remembrance Sunday last year.  The Home Office twice rejected Swealmeen’s claims for asylum – once in 2014 and again in 2020 – but new details raise questions about why he was not pursued for deportation as long ago as 2015. Court documents obtained by BBC News show that he claimed to be of Syrian heritage and in fear for his life – but was unable to give basic details about where his family lived or why they were in danger. Language analysis conducted by the Home Office concluded that there was a high likelihood that he was Iraqi and was “very unlikely” to be Syrian. Swealmeen travelled to the UK in 2014 on a genuine Jordanian passport, which gave his birthplace as Iraq and his date of birth as 11 October 1989. An immigration judge dismissed his asylum appeal in April 2015, writing in a ruling quoted by BBC News: “His account of his time in Syria gives the impression of someone quoting information that is in the public domain rather than having first-hand experience. “The appellant did not identify himself with any particular faction or indicate that he would be at risk other than in a general sense.” That ruling meant the Home Office had the green light to send Swealmeen back to Iraq or Jordan, as it had previously told him it would do. Instead, however, Swealmeen remained in the UK and is thought to have been moved to the Fazakerley area of Liverpool in late 2016. In 2017, he mounted a new asylum claim using a different name but that was rejected at the end of 2020, prompting another appeal in January 2021. Police believe that Swealmeen was plotting a terror attack by at least April 2021, when he rented a property and started buying parts needed for a bomb. Detectives believe it is most likely that he acted alone although counter-terrorism experts have said it is incredibly rare for someone to plan an atrocity for seven months without telling anyone. The case raises questions about why Swealmeen was not deported in 2015 when his first asylum appeal was rejected on several grounds, and he could have been spotted earlier as a danger to himself and others. The Home Office declined to comment on Swealmeen’s case but said: “We are fixing the broken asylum system. The ‘new plan for immigration’ will require people to raise all protection-related issues upfront to tackle the practice of making multiple and sequential claims and enable the removal of those with no right to be in our country more quickly.”",News/UK news,Liverpool bomber had asylum claim rejected six years before attack,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/24/liverpool-bomber-emad-al-swealmeen-asylum-claim-rejected-before-attack
1/24/2022,"The murders of four young gay men in 2014 and 2015 by the serial killer Stephen Port were nothing new. Nor, sadly, was the catalogue of police failings that followed. The murder of “queers” has been going on for decades, with investigations repeatedly marred by toxic incompetence, negligence, indifference and homophobia. The mishandling of the Dennis Nilsen investigation is revealed in a damning three-part BBC documentary, which begins on Monday on BBC Two. It tells the grisly tale of mass murder and dismemberment from the point of view of the lives of the victims, and explores what their deaths tell us about society at the time. The missed opportunities to nail Nilsen are meticulously examined, including how police paid scant attention to parents concerned about their missing sons.  Nilsen is believed to have murdered up to 16 vulnerable young men, many of whom were gay, in north London between 1978 and 1983. He also attempted to kill several others. Most were homeless or runaways; some sex workers. Others were gay or straight youths, lured to Nilsen’s house with the promise of a meal, a drink or sex. It’s possible that most of the victims died needlessly, because – in a worrying foreshadowing of criticism of the police handling of the Stephen Port investigation – the police failed to conduct a robust investigation after the alert was raised regarding two attempted killings by Nilsen. Directed by the gay filmmaker Michael Ogden, The Nilsen Files is an attempt to understand how as many as 16 young men could disappear from the nation’s capital without anyone seemingly noticing. From the outset, prejudice clouded police investigations and media reporting. The victims were often depicted in a lurid, unflattering light: as male prostitutes and drifters of no fixed abode, who inhabited an underworld on the margins of society. As one interviewee put it: “We were trash … the lowest of the low.” Some press coverage at the time insinuated that the victims were partly to blame for their own deaths. We’ll never know how many of Nilsen’s victims were sex workers, or gay – but, once described as such by Nilsen, police, media and public sympathy diminished. They were neither respectable nor seemed to matter. Nilsen’s killings might be exceptional because of their number and what he did to the bodies. But they fit a pattern. Gay men were regularly murdered during this period, and their killers were rarely exhaustively pursued by police. During this era, the Met seemed more interested in prosecuting gay men than in protecting them. After the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality in 1967, police harassment increased and gay arrests rocketed to more than 1,000 a year during the 1970s and 1980s. From 1986 to 1991, I identified in my own research, working as a human rights campaigner, 50 murders where evidence pointed to a homophobic motive. There was little media coverage or public outcry around these murders at the time they were committed. The police investigations that followed them were, in most cases, wholly inadequate: involving little liaison with the LGBTQ+ community and often only seemingly perfunctory appeals for witnesses. The LGBTQ+ community was subsequently promised new procedures were to be put in place, and that past mistakes would not be repeated. But the Stephen Port inquest verdict revealed this was not the case: failings continued, at least, at the Met. A year after his first murder in 1978, Nilsen tried to kill Andrew Ho. Ho escaped and reported the attack to police. Ho was nervous and decided to not press charges. He was an immigrant and, at 19, under the then lawful gay age of consent of 21, and could have faced two years in jail. Nilsen was questioned but officers took no action. Had they done a proper investigation and caught Nilsen, 15 victims might still be alive. Another survivor was Douglas Stewart, who fought off a strangulation attempt by Nilsen in November 1980. But police dismissed the incident as an alcohol-fuelled lovers’ quarrel. Stewart later said “as soon as the word ‘homosexual’ was mentioned, the police lost all interest”. Had police done a thorough search of Nilsen’s flat in response to Ho’s and Stewart’s reports against him, , they might have discovered bodies hidden under the floorboards, as well as traces of dissected corpses in his garden shed and on land at the rear where he burned body parts. Instead, Nilsen was left to kill many more times. In May 1982, Carl Stottor was attacked by Nilsen and also lived to tell the tale. Again, the police did nothing. At Nilsen’s trial, 19-year-old Paul Nobbs testified that, despite escaping a murder attempt, he never went to the police. Prevailing homophobia helped silence him. He was under 21 and not out as gay to his family. Although Nilsen’s crimes were first uncovered nearly 40 years ago, several of his possible victims remain unidentified. It’s time to reopen the police investigation, and allow the use of the latest DNA and forensic technology, to ensure the families of any unidentified young men killed by Nilsen can finally be given conclusive answers to the question of what happened to their loved ones. These failings by the police can, sadly, be added to those revealed at the inquest into the failings over the Stephen Port investigation. From these findings, the Met must now work to establish, in consultation with the LGBTQ+ community, new binding protocols for how homophobic murders are investigated. Because, as we have seen – time and again – LGBTQ+ people are too often let down by the police. Over to you, Cressida Dick. Peter Tatchell is a human rights campaigner.

1/24/2022,"Here’s a striking and mysterious debut from the Dominican Republic, where film-maker Nino Martínez Sosa recounts a fascinating true-life story of occupation and resistance from the turn of the last century. Olivorio Mateo was a peasant and faith healer who became known to his disciples as Papa Liborio; he built a self-sufficient community in the mountains. But when US forces occupied in the 1910s, Liborio was branded a bandit, and killed. Not that you’d know any of the historical facts from watching this, which is set squarely in the arthouse endurance-test genre: there is little to no scene-setting or explainers, with the kind of pacing often euphemistically described by critics as “deliberate”. It begins after Liborio vanishes from his village during a hurricane, presumed dead. When he is found alive, he claims to have returned from God with healing powers and takes a band of followers up into the mountains.  Is he a charlatan? Madman? Or simply an inspirational community leader? Director Sosa’s answer seems to be that the truth is unknowable. So he tells the story through the eyes of six believers, beginning with Liborio’s son. But the most moving is from the perspective of a woman who begs Liborio to bring back her infant child from the dead. A powerfully charismatic leading performance by Vicente Santos is the force of gravity here. He plays Liborio as an ambiguous character: sometimes he seems high on a messiah complex; at others his spirituality feels genuine. In the end he becomes a tragic hero. Santos’s performance is a reminder that awards season only dishes out gongs to a small corner of the film-making world. Liborio is shot very simply, using handheld cinematography that gives it a modern feel, and the soundtrack is alive with the sounds of nature. There’s an especially good moment when an American commander is trying to sleep. This is a man who calls Liborio a “witch doctor” and rides into the community vowing to instil law and order (a quick glance around would tell him this is a model community). A mosquito buzzes around his bed, an intruder and unwanted, much like himself.  ​Liborio is available on 26 January on Mubi.",Arts/Film,Liborio review – brooding portrait of a beguilingly charismatic folk hero,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/24/liborio-review-brooding-portrait-of-a-beguilingly-charismatic-folk-hero
1/24/2022,"A nationwide day of action against HS2 – involving banner drops, solidarity protests and a Twitter storm – is planned for Monday as the bill to expand the line beyond Crewe is presented to parliament. Environmental activists say the bill will “sanction immense and irreversible destruction to the environment” and want to raise awareness of HS2’s “continuing ecocide, corruption and financial mis-management”.  In contrast, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has called the bill, which extends HS2 from Crewe to Manchester, “a landmark moment” in improving the country’s rail connections. The Department for Transport said the line would cut travel times from Manchester to London by about 55 minutes and 45 minutes between Manchester and Birmingham. Labour politicians have described the proposals as the wrong plan for the north and a missed opportunity. The day of action is expected to include events along the line with a particular focus on Manchester, in Piccadilly Gardens, and Birmingham, at the Thinktank Science Museum. Campaigners are also using social media and want to create a “Twitter storm” using the hashtags #HS2CostingTheEarth, #StopHS2 and #HS2Rebellion. Alan, a spokesperson for Stop HS2 North, said activists began the day with banner drops. “Now we will take part in protests and solidarity events all along the proposed route, so we can demonstrate to the government how unpopular and unnecessary this project is,” he said. “People are being faced with a choice between being able to heat or eat. Meanwhile, HS2 has a blank cheque to commit terrible and irreversible ecocide. This money ought to be used to properly fund our NHS, improve local transport links, help ordinary people with the rising cost of living, and to resolve our energy crisis.” Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said he remained committed to bringing HS2 to the region. But he said it was the “wrong plan. He added: “Building HS2 on the surface at Manchester Piccadilly means the new station will be at full capacity from day one. It means the new train services from Liverpool and Leeds having to reverse out. And it also means forever losing prime development land and the economic opportunity that goes with it. “We also again have to ask again: why is Greater Manchester the only part of the country being asked to make a substantial financial contribution to the cost of HS2? We believe there is a better plan which would do much more to level up the north of England with the south.” He called for a new underground station in Manchester to help deliver a new line between Manchester and Leeds, “which is what we were promised”. The government published its £96bn integrated rail plan for the north in November, which abandoned an eastern leg of HS2 and downgraded plans for a new line across the Pennines. Louise Haigh, the shadow transport secretary, said Monday’s HS2 bill represented “a monumental missed opportunity to drive growth and investment right across the north and the Midlands. “The rail betrayal will hit millions of people and leave swathes of the north and the Midlands in the slow lane for decades.”",News/UK news,HS2 protesters plan ‘nationwide day of action’ over rail expansion,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/24/hs2-protesters-plan-nationwide-day-action-rail-expansion
1/24/2022,"In 1986, Toni was working as a clinical laboratory director in St Louis, Missouri. “I was single at the time and keen to meet someone,” she says. One Friday night, she and a friend were listening to the area’s flagship radio station KMOX, which hosted a show called Dateline. “The idea was that single people called in, shared a bit about themselves, and listeners could contact the radio station for their details afterwards,” says Toni. She made a bet with her friend that she would call one of the men from the show. “At the time, it wasn’t the thing to do,” she laughs. “Internet dating didn’t exist back then and a lot of strange people would call into that show. But we thought it would be a funny story to tell if I gave it a go.” She had vetoed lots of callers before Ron came on the show at the end of the night. He had recently moved from North Carolina to a nearby town to work for a medical technology company, and was keen to meet new people. “My sister suggested I try going on the radio to find a date,” he says. “Now I’m used to public speaking, but at the time I was very scared. [The station] gave you guidelines on how to introduce yourself and I was on air for about a minute.”  Toni says he was the only person who sparked her interest. “He said he wanted someone family-oriented, sporty and fun-loving, which described me,” she says. “Before he came on, I thought: ‘Whoever this is, I guess I need to call them, because I’d said I would.’ Luckily he sounded nice.” Although she wasn’t expecting it to go anywhere, the pair immediately hit it off when she called. “I had about five calls after the show but Toni stood out,” says Ron. “We agreed to meet at a restaurant in St Louis.” Over the phone, he described himself as “average-looking”, so Toni was surprised to discover he was “very handsome”. During their dinner date, they found out they had lots in common. “We are both from large, Catholic families, worked in similar fields and shared a lot of the same values,” says Ron. For their next date, Toni travelled to his town, just outside St Louis. “There were no cellphones, so I looked at the back of the phonebook for a map of the city area. I couldn’t find his town at first and it took me ages to figure it out.” She eventually made it and they went on a bike ride together. “I fell off and cracked my fingers,” she says. “Then Ron took me to his place and cooked dinner.” From then on, they became a couple. “At first, I was worried it wouldn’t work because he was a few years younger than me,” says Toni. “I told a girl at work about him and she said I could introduce him to her instead if I wanted. That was when I knew I wanted to keep him for myself.” Both passionate about the outdoors, they spent their dates walking, talking and playing tennis. Ron proposed to Toni at a Billy Joel concert in 1987, and they married and moved in together the following year in St Louis. Having a family was equally important to both of them, and their children joined the family in 1991 and 1994. “We still have lots of shared interests and love going to national parks together,” says Toni. “He’s slow to anger and pretty calm, which was really important to me, as it means we never get into big fights. He’s also a very hard worker, which our family really appreciates.” Ron loves his wife’s commitment to their family. “We’ve both been dedicated to raising our children,” he says. “Toni is a great mother, and we’re constantly supporting each other in everything we do. I really value the simple things that some people forget over time, like her honesty and loyalty.” Want to share your story?
