1/16/2022,"The Chinese capital, Beijing, has reported its first locally transmitted case of Omicron coronavirus variant, state media reported on Saturday, less than three weeks before the Beijing Olympic Winter Games. An official at the city’s disease control authority said at a press conference that laboratory testing found “mutations specific to the Omicron variant” in the person. The authorities have since published detailed account of the patient’s activity that dates back to 31 December.  Haidian district officials in Beijing said they had sealed up the infected person’s residential compound and workplace. They have also collected 2,430 samples for testing from people linked to the two locations. The detection of the highly infectious Omicron variant comes less than three weeks before the opening ceremony of the Winter Games on 4 February, and the lunar new year celebrations that begin on 1 February. Public health experts say the new variant poses the biggest threat to the country’s zero-Covid strategy. The first Omicron case in China was detected in the northern city of Tianjin on 9 December from an overseas returnee, who showed no symptoms on arrival. In the past month, at least 14 provincial-level places in China – including Shanghai – have reported Omicron cases, both imported and locally transmitted, according to state media. “Now Beijing’s epidemic prevention and control work faces the double risk of overseas and domestic cases,” Pang Xinghuo, the deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, said at the press conference. In the past few weeks, dozens of domestic and international flights have been suspended to control the spread of the disease. The authorities have also urged citizens not to leave town unnecessarily during the lunar new year holiday period. The Chinese capital has been on high alert since the first reported Omicron case in neighbouring Tianjin last month. On Saturday, Xu Hejian, the Chinese capital’s spokesperson, urged the municipal government departments to “ensure the safety of the capital, the Winter Olympics, and its residents”. Last week, Beijing’s traffic management authority asked people to stay away from the special vehicles used to ferry athletes to and from the Winter Olympics venues in the event of a car incident. The Winter Games, which begin on 4 February will be kept in a “closed loop”. This means that only a limited number of spectators may be allowed in venues. Overseas spectators will not be allowed to enter the country, and personnel involved in the Games will have to avoid contact with people outside the loop. On Saturday, China’s National Health Commission reported 165 new confirmed coronavirus cases for 14 January, down from 201 a day earlier. Of the new infections, 104 were locally transmitted, according to a statement by the National Health Commission, compared with 143 a day earlier.

1/16/2022,"August 2018 and England are playing India in the third Test at Trent Bridge. They are losing, 32 for two in the fourth innings and 489 runs behind. Joe Root is in, batting with the team’s latest call-up, Ollie Pope. Pope had made his debut at Lord’s the week before, when he became their youngest middle-order batsman since Denis Compton, 70 years earlier. Here, he hits his first ball through cover for one four and his third through gully for another. Handsome shots, but they betray a vulnerability, too. India’s bowlers hold that line outside off and, soon enough, he edges a catch to third slip for 16.  England dropped Pope for the next match. It was a tactical decision, they wanted to play Moeen Ali as a second spinner, but it suggested they did not think Pope was quite ready yet. He picked up on the hint and he did the right thing. Soon after, he suffered a dislocated shoulder and during his time off he got together with his batting coach at Surrey, Vikram Solanki, to talk about what he needed to do to succeed in Test cricket. “We decided the way I was getting out most was pushing at those fifth-stump balls that I should probably be leaving,” Pope said later. They decided he needed to make two changes. One was technical – Pope moved across to an off-stump guard – and the other was temperamental: he resolved to tighten up and stop playing so many loose shots. He said the injury had given him “a real hunger” to play Test cricket. Four years on and England are playing Australia in the fifth Test at Hobart. They are losing, again, 81 for four in the first innings and 222 runs behind. Pope is in. He is playing because Jonny Bairstow’s injury means he has been given an unexpected recall after being dropped. Given his poor form and the series score, the match might just be the last chance he gets in Test cricket for a while. He has started well. There is another of those gorgeous cover drives for four and a couple of boundaries through midwicket too. He has made it to 16 and now Scott Boland is bowling. There was nothing cunning about Boland’s plan. He gave Pope a ball outside off, Pope played and missed. He gave him two more in the same place and Pope left them both. The fourth ball came in at him and Pope blocked it. The fifth ball was back out wide again and Pope could not help himself, he stretched across and prodded his bat at it. The edge flew through to the keeper and he was out for 14. Pope’s was not the only poor dismissal, there were others just as bad. Rory Burns was run out by an inch because of a moment’s hesitation, when a dive for the line might have saved him. But it is worth picking out, because it says so much about the confused state of English cricket. Pope is, most people agree, just about the best young English batsman in county cricket. He is 24, has made more than 4,000 first-class runs at an average of 51. Although it is beginning to feel like a long time ago, he has had some success in Test matches. He won a man-of-the-match award in South Africa a couple of years ago, when he made 135 at Port Elizabeth. And here he is, struggling along, in and out of the team, making the same mistakes. Everyone has their own theories why. Three old batters, Nick Compton, Rikki Clarke and Owais Shah, got into a back-and-forth about it on Twitter. Compton felt it was temperamental, a lack of discipline and patience, and said that players had forgotten how to bat for long stretches of time. Shah felt it was technical, that taking guard on off stump was a mistake and that it was time to move on to another young batsman because Pope had already been given enough rope. Clarke argued otherwise, he felt it was down to the team environment and the unsteadying effect of the way players had been rotated in and out of the team in the past 12 months. It was an interesting disagreement. It spoke to how losing the Ashes has cracked open English cricket and exposed the multitude of problems in it. It is going to take some smart thinking from the management to figure out which one needs fixing first and how to do it. The team’s managing director, Ashley Giles, says we need systemic change. He might be right. Myself, I would ask why the man everyone reckons is the best young batsman on the circuit is still making the same mistakes he did when he was a rookie. Pope is not the only good young player who seems to have gone backwards since he came into this England set-up. Zak Crawley, who made 267 against Pakistan, is another, Haseeb Hameed, who made 82 against India on his debut, is another, Dom Sibley, who has scored centuries against South Africa and the West Indies, is a third. Root is just about the only player in the squad who has played anything like his best while Chris Silverwood has been in charge. Giles and Silverwood might ask why the English cricket is not providing their team with better players, but equally, English cricket might ask why Giles and Silverwood are not getting more out of the best they have been provided with.",Sport/Sport,Ollie Pope’s repeated mistakes shows England cricket’s state of confusion,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/15/ollie-popes-repeated-mistakes-shows-england-crickets-state-of-confusion
1/16/2022,"It is 12 days (as of Sunday) since Novak Djokovic announced he would be flying to Australia, having been granted a medical exemption against the vaccine mandate required for all players who want to play the Australian Open. In that time, public opinion in Australia has veered between outrage that he should be given an exemption at all to dismay and embarrassment at the way their government has handled the entire thing, throwing Djokovic into a detention hotel and rescinding his visa for a second time.  Djokovic’s behaviour in the days after his positive Covid-19 test – especially the following day, when he fulfilled a magazine interview commitment without telling anyone there that he was positive – was widely criticised and drew an apology from the world No 1. Many feel he should not be there, but at the same time don’t like what’s happened to him What of Djokovic’s fellow players? For a man who, in 2020, co-founded a new players’ union (the Professional Tennis Players’ Association), designed to serve the interests of all players, it will not be lost on Djokovic that support for him among his peers has been relatively unenthusiastic. Though some have sympathised with his plight, many believe he should have done what they did, get vaccinated, the only certain way to ensure entry to the country. Part of that might be down to the complicated nature of what has happened to Djokovic since he arrived in Melbourne late on 5 January, believing he had a valid medical exemption, which was issued by the state of Victoria and approved by Tennis Australia, due to him testing positive for Covid on 16 December. However, since a previous infection is not a valid reason for overseas travellers to enter Australia, Federal officials revoked his visa. The saga has dragged on to the point where Djokovic, having won an initial appeal, awaits a further appeal on Sunday to see if he can defend his title. Tournament victory, as unlikely as that looks right now, would give Djokovic a record 21st Grand Slam title. There is a lot on the line. The ATP revealed last week that 97 of the men’s top 100 have been vaccinated. Many, such as Stefanos Tsitsipas, were reluctant to get the jab at first, but did so because they knew that was what was required to continue playing on the Tour. Rafael Nadal said in November that not getting vaccinated is “a bit selfish”. Djokovic chose not to. Andy Murray, a strong vaccine advocate, said he would not “kick Novak when he’s down”, adding that the whole thing was “not a good situation for anyone”. But the Australian Alex de Minaur, the world No 42, agreed, hinted at the resentment many people feel in Melbourne, which endured the longest lockdown of any city in the world. “Australians have gone through a lot,” he said. “There’s no secret about that. They’ve had it very tough. They’ve done a lot of work to protect themselves and their borders. When you’re coming in, as well as every other tennis player, if you wanted to come into the country, you had to be double vaccinated. It was up to him, his choices, his judgment.” Support has come from the most unlikely of sources, in the form of Australian Nick Kyrgios, hardly his biggest fan. Kyrgios, who said he was vaccinated “for others and my mother’s health”, is highly critical of how Australia has treated Djokovic. “It’s just a shit-show,” he told the No Boundaries Podcast. “It’s not even about the vaccination anymore. I feel so sorry for him. “How we’re dealing with stuff is just so embarrassing. I just think if Australia had dealt with Covid better, I don’t think this would be such a big issue. It’s insane now.” Kyrgios said Djokovic had contacted him to thank him for his support. “Imagine how he’s feeling,” the Australian said. “He probably wants a little bit of support from other players. He’s getting it from me. I’m not the one he expected to go out in the media and have his back. “He’s feeling alienated and as a human that is a dangerous place to be. On a human level, he needs some support from other players.” Many remain annoyed, though. “I respect that he fights for what he believes and I can be empathetic with what he is going through in Australia, but it’s a bit selfish from him to arrive here as the only player unvaccinated,” said the Portuguese player Joao Sousa. “It’s tough for us players to accept that.” The Australian Sam Stosur, a former US Open champion who will be playing her final singles match at the Australian Open, said no one has come out of this situation looking good. “It’s all been a little bit messy, that’s probably an understatement,” she said. “It’s a really unfortunate situation that it’s come to at this point in time. “Hopefully over the weekend a decision can be made finally, whether you agree or don’t agree, he stays, he goes. Whatever the case, it’s just got to be decided and hopefully it’s not going to tarnish the rest of the Australian Open. “It’s a huge story around the world. We want the Aussie Open to be for good things, not unfortunately what the Novak situation has become.”",Sport/Sport,Djokovic’s vaccine stance leaves him short of support from fellow players | Simon Cambers,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/15/djokovics-vaccine-stance-leaves-him-short-of-support-from-fellow-players
1/16/2022,"Born in Surrey in 1987, actor Tom Felton rose to fame playing Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter films. His other film roles include Anna and the King, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and Amma Asante’s Belle and A United Kingdom. He is also a musician, and is one of the founders of Six String Productions, a recording company devoted to signing young musical artists. He stars opposite Samantha Morton in Sky original Save the Cinema, about a Welsh community’s battle to save their local theatre from demolition.  Dear Evan Hansen I found this really poignant and important. Teen suicide is not a subject people might jump into, but I don’t know any contemporary musical that has opened up more of a conversation on this – and it need to be discussed a lot more. Now, me and my 15-year-old niece can talk about that sort of thing without it being an absolutely terrifying subject. The music’s fantastic, the performances are wonderfully done. And it’s really contemporary: you see texts flying up and down the wall, and visual representations of how things go viral. George Harrison: All Things Must Pass I got very excited about the 50-year anniversary box set of this album – it’s a big, geeky fan box full of vinyl, pictures, letters, pieces of writing. I haven’t actually opened it yet – it sits pride of place in my office – but I look forward to sharing it one night with a few other Beatles nut-heads like myself. I like going back to George, especially when I feel like I’ve listened to too much contemporary music – which I love, but his music brings me back to myself. Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton: A Biography by Edward Rice I’m reading this at the moment. It’s a Bible-thick book about this guy who was essentially a spy – he was the original James Bond. Except he spoke, like, 17 languages and was one of the first white westerners to infiltrate different religious groups abroad, in places like Asia. I love the old Phileas Fogg idea of going away for 80 days and coming back with all these different spices and whatever else you’ve picked up. And this chap did it on a Herculean scale. I’m getting a real kick out of that right now. Vivo (Kirk DeMicco, 2021) I’m completely obsessed with this animated film on Netflix. I’m a massive fan of Lin-Manuel Miranda, who plays the title character and wrote the songs. It’s set in Cuba, and Vivo is a beautifully cute little kinkajou, a small monkey, and he does this amazing musical routine for the tourists with his owner, a very old man who’s been making music his whole life. And they go on quite the adventure. I watched it with my niece, then watched it again a couple of days later by myself. Much like Hamilton, every time you watch it there’s another layer you didn’t see before. Westminster Abbey I was very lucky to be asked by the Duchess [of Cambridge] – when I say asked, it wasn’t like Kate gave me a call and was like, “Hey, Tom, what you doing Friday?” – but they asked me to read out one of the poems for the Christmas carol service last month. My mum’s a big fan of hers. We’d never been to Westminster Abbey before, and we got there a couple of hours early to do a run-through. We both love history, so we could have walked around there for days looking at all the different people who had achieved certain things. It was much grander than I expected, and much warmer – sometimes those creepy old cathedral places feel a bit crypt-y. Formula One I was absolutely gripped this year. Hamilton has been dominating the sport for however many seasons it is in a row now, which made it less exciting, because you’re watching the winner win every time. But this year Max Verstappen, this plucky Dutch kid, has been on his tail the entire time, nipping at his heels. It came down to the most nail-biting finish, the sort of thing you’d write in a film, where in the last lap of the last race Max just edged in front. It does wonders for the sport – makes it a lot more interesting to watch.

1/16/2022,"The first documentary from Andrea Arnold deals, like several of her fiction films, with fractured mother-daughter bonds. But the mother in this case is Luma, a Holstein Friesian cow; the daughters – and we meet two of them, born during the course of Arnold’s four-year-production period – are calves who are wrenched from their mother’s side with a haste that, like much in the life of a dairy cow, seems unduly callous. This is certainly not the first film to make the point that industrial farming and animal welfare are uneasy bedfellows. Everything from Nikolaus Geyrhalter’s austere, widescreen tableaux of industrial food production in Our Daily Bread (2005) to Robert Kenner’s Oscar-nominated Food, Inc (2008), which lifts the lid on America’s corporate food production, argues that the costs of intensive farming are high and are borne largely by the livestock. But Arnold’s film encourages an intimacy and emotional connection with its bovine subject that is rarely achieved elsewhere. The closest comparison would be Viktor Kosakovskiy’s Gunda (2020), which traced the daily life of a pig through artfully framed black and white photography.  Arnold, however, has no desire to prettify her subject matter. The film is shot with handheld urgency, the lens positioned at udder and eye level. She forces us to confront the grinding cycle of life for a dairy cow, the dull buzz of strip lights and the murky gloom in the milking sheds. Perhaps most heartbreaking is the moment of skittish joy when the cows are released into pastures in spring – tellingly, it’s a good 45 minutes into the film before we even glimpse a blade of grass. It’s not an easy watch, certainly – I cried more or less solidly through the last 30 minutes – but it’s an important one.",Arts/Film,Cow review – Andrea Arnold’s deeply moving chronicle of the life of a dairy cow,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/15/cow-review-andrea-arnold-deeply-moving-chronicle-of-the-life-of-a-dairy-cow
1/16/2022,"The first mass use of the word “snub” in any given year ushers in award season for me. This year, Kristen Stewart has been snubbed, apparently, after the Screen Actors Guild failed to nominate her for a best actress award for her role as Princess Diana in Pablo Larraín’s Spencer. She had been widely tipped to pick up an Oscar nomination, perhaps for the brazen bizarreness of the casting, which actually sort of worked. If she has been snubbed here, commentators are asking, will she be shut out of the Oscars? As controversies go, it is a tame one, which speaks volumes about the unsettled state that award ceremonies seem to have found themselves in. I say this as someone with a disproportionate love of these ridiculous events, but even I am finding it difficult to care. Usually, I love the clothes and the speeches and being put out when something I adored is passed over in favour of something objectively worse, and feeling thrilled when Olivia Colman inevitably wins everything, and I love looking out for that precise moment when an actor adjusts their face from “absolutely fuming” to “gracious in defeat”.  But television audiences are declining rapidly, year on year, and award show chatter has become more of a quiet background murmur. Omicron has forced the indefinite postponement of the Grammys. The Golden Globes took place last weekend, untelevised and with no celebrity involvement, after a series of scandals meant any statues it gave out would probably end up in the weird cupboard at the back of the kitchen rather than on the mantelpiece. (I felt for the winners who made history in a year when it was harder to celebrate that, such as Pose’s MJ Rodriguez, who became the first trans woman to win a Golden Globe, for best actress in a TV drama.) The Oscars will have a host after three years without one, though whether that will be Tom Holland or Pete Davidson is the internet’s guess. Anyone to try to stem the tide of fleeing viewers. It is unsurprising that seeing famous people messing around in ballgowns and designer suits and jewellery that requires its own bodyguards has lost some appeal during two years of a pandemic, but whether world events simply hastened a decline that was already in progress is unclear. It could be that these ceremonies go the way of the Golden Globes – if a gong is handed out in an empty forest, does anyone hear the tearful acceptance speeches? – and pare back to basics, or this could be a chance to try an over-the-top, full showbiz spectacle once again. I’d prefer the latter. I’d better follow them all closely, just to see. Elvis Costello has been discussing the lyrical content of his 1979 hit Oliver’s Army for years, and now, he says, he won’t be playing it live any more. It famously uses a derogatory phrase for Irish Catholics, which contains a racial slur. “That’s what my grandfather was called in the British army – it’s historically a fact – but people hear that word go off like a bell and accuse me of something that I didn’t intend,” he told the Telegraph. This is not the first time the song’s lyrics have led to a discussion about its meaning and intent. In 2013, BBC’s 6 Music radio station censored it, explaining that a number of factors had been taken into consideration, including the time of day and the context of the programme on which it was broadcast. Costello argued that the BBC was making it worse by drawing attention to the lyrics. “Just don’t play the record,” he said. The song is anti-colonialism and anti-war, so context matters. But Costello has explained it, again and again, and now he has made the decision to retire it. Not to delete it from record collections, just not to sing it live after 43 years. Some may take that in bad faith and see it as another sign of cancel culture marching on unchecked, but it seems to me like a decision taken in good faith, in consideration of attitudes that have shifted and developed over time. Although often it feels like the opposite, I do think we have become better, collectively, at discussing complex ideas. Applying that to a lyrical choice made so many years ago seems perfectly reasonable. Finally, after 18 months or so of almost buying tickets and then deciding it probably wasn’t worth it, I went back to the cinema. Even though my only local option is the fancy chain with sofas for seats, which brings food to you at any time – eating burgers while midway through watching a film is an affront to cinemagoing and that is a hill I will die on – I was childishly delighted to be back. Everything about it, from the ads to the trailers to sitting still for more than two hours without any desire to look at my phone, made me determined to go again regularly. It was Licorice Pizza that lured me in. As a fan of both Paul Thomas Anderson and sunshine, I thought it would be perfect to head out into the chill of a winter’s evening and then sit in a dark room soaking up the Californian heat. There were plenty of things to take away from the film, but one that seemed particularly lovely was the fact that its leads, Cooper Hoffman and Alana Haim, had beautifully normal teeth. Is this the beginning of the end for those hyper-real, super-straight white veneers?

1/16/2022,"It is fair to say that Kevin De Bruyne has history with Chelsea. And not only because of his frustrating spell at the club earlier in his career. The Manchester City midfielder was wounded on every level by them in last season’s Champions League final – roughed up by Antonio Rüdiger, his game ended early with a fractured eye socket; condemned, as well, to a runners-up medal.  This was a measure of revenge. It had been a meandering meeting of first versus second in the Premier League, marked mainly by what did not happen. Romelu Lukaku did not execute a straightforward pass which could have set up Hakim Ziyech and the Chelsea striker did not beat Ederson when though on goal. For City, Jack Grealish did not finish when one-on-one with Kepa Arrizabalaga. But City were the better team, Chelsea simply not showing enough ambition, and De Bruyne made the difference with a goal that showcased so many of his best qualities. There was the intelligence to sniff out space in between the lines, getting goalside of N’Golo Kanté and then the strength to ride the Chelsea midfielder’s attempted slide tackle. Finally, when neither Thiago Silva or Mateo Kovacic could get close to him, there was a glorious right-footed curler that was too good for Arrizabalaga, who appeared to show him too much of the far corner. Chelsea had needed to win to keep their faint hopes of a title challenge alive but City, who kicked off 10 points clear of them, will not be caught by them now. Can Liverpool stop them? It feels unlikely after this, a 12th league win on the spin. Pep Guardiola is primed for an incredible fourth title in five years. This is what a dynasty looked like. For Chelsea, it is now two wins in eight in the competition. They have let their standards slip. City are a ridiculously imposing prospect at the Etihad, so smooth, so unflappable. The battle lines were drawn early on as Raheem Sterling showed he had the beating of Marcos Alonso up the right flank. City were on the front foot, dominating the ball, probing for the killer pass, and Chelsea had to put everything into their defensive structure. Thomas Tuchel had described City as the benchmark, although he knew how to beat them. Three times in three attempts he had done so in the closing weeks of last season – most famously in the Champions League final. The tone felt different here, and not only because of City’s convincing victory at Stamford Bridge in September. Unflappable is not the adjective to describe Tuchel during a match and his brand of professional dramatics were on show as Chelsea missed a series of final balls which they simply had to make in the opening quarter. Ziyech had Tuchel hopping up and down when he missed two of them, one after Lukaku had rushed up the inside right channel. But it was the centre-forward who erred most grievously in the 10th minute. Lukaku had benefited when John Stones missed a tackle, allowing him to surge forward, and he had options left and right. He chose the latter, trying to usher in Ziyech, only to overhit the pass dreadfully. It felt like a moment that Chelsea could live to regret. Tuchel had reverted to his back three system after the midweek Carabao Cup win at Tottenham but it was more like a five for long spells. With the inside forwards also deep, Chelsea were happy to cede the initiative to City, asking whether they could break them down. “Boring, boring Chelsea,” grumbled the home crowd. Chelsea defended well in front of their penalty area before the interval but they could not get out, they struggled to gain any sort of foothold higher up the pitch. Stones had headed straight at Arrizabalaga from a corner in the 14th minute and a snapshot of the first period from a City point of view came shortly after the half hour. Phil Foden sliced up the inside left, exploding past a clutch of dark blue shirts to cross but there was nobody attacking the six-yard box. The big moment of the first half came on 39 minutes. Alonso played Kovacic into trouble and, with De Bruyne all over him, the Chelsea midfielder tried to move it square. De Bruyne made the tackle and the ball spun kindly for Grealish who, rather abruptly, had only Arrizabalaga to beat. Chelsea were exposed but Grealish could not finish, Arrizabalaga out quickly and able to turn his shot past the post. Chelsea had not mustered a shot on goal before the interval but they sprang forward to do so straight after the restart when Kovacic released Lukaku. He knew what he wanted to do, open up his body and bend a left-footed shot past Ederson, who was high off his line. The trouble was that everybody in the stadium also knew the plan, including Ederson, who dived right to save. It was a long way from being Lukaku’s day. Tuchel apart, there was a strange lack of energy about such a big game for long spells, including from the stands. The Chelsea support waved inflatables of the Champions League trophy; their City counterparts searched for something to get behind. De Bruyne provided it. He had worked Arrizabalaga with a free-kick and Sterling had dragged a shot wide of the far post from a Foden pass when De Bruyne bent the game to the force of his will. The Chelsea substitute Timo Werner would see a shot blocked while Foden fired high late on. City had done enough.",Sport/Football,Kevin De Bruyne fires Manchester City 13 points clear of toothless Chelsea,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/15/manchester-city-chelsea-premier-league-match-report
1/16/2022,"Sunday’s north London derby has been postponed after the Premier League agreed to a request from Arsenal, whose squad has been severely hit by injuries and a range of other problems, that the match be called off. Arsenal would have been without more than 14 first-team players for their visit to Spurs and requested the postponement because they felt they would be unable to meet the league’s criteria for fulfilling a fixture. Clubs can make an application if they do not have 13 outfielders and a goalkeeper available and, after Arsenal announced their intention on Friday night, the decision to postpone was confirmed on Saturday afternoon.  It is the 20th in a rash of top-flight postponements in recent weeks that have been spurred by the Coronavirus outbreak. Arsenal’s only known current Covid-19 case is Martin Ødegaard but the league’s rules allow other factors to come into play. When Leicester’s match at Everton, scheduled for 11 January, was called off the Premier League cited “Covid-19 cases, injuries and players on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations” as the contributing factors. Arsenal are thought to be missing at least eight players with injury and have four more representing their countries in Cameroon. Granit Xhaka would also have been absent through suspension, but that is understood not to have been relevant to this case. In a statement, the Premier League said: “Following a request from Arsenal FC, the Premier League Board met today and regrettably agreed to postpone the club’s away fixture against Tottenham Hotspur, due to be played at 4.30pm on Sunday 16 January. Arsenal's fixture against Reading in the Women's Super League on Sunday has been postponed due to Covid-19 cases and injuries in the visiting side's squad, both clubs said on Saturday. ""In light of the increased rate of transmissions from the Omicron variant of Covid-19, the FA will review the circumstances surrounding the postponement and continue work with affected clubs,"" Reading said in a statement. This is the second WSL game to be called off this week after Chelsea had their third game in a row cancelled on Friday when their match with Everton was postponed for the similar reasons. Leaders Arsenal have 25 points from 10 games, nine points ahead of sixth-placed Reading. PA Media “With Arsenal having fewer than the required number of players available for the match (13 outfield players and one goalkeeper), the Board accepted the club’s application. The decision is a result of a combination of Covid-19, existing and recent injuries and players on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations. All clubs are able to apply for a postponement if Covid-19 infections are a factor in their request. “The League apologises for the inconvenience and disruption caused to supporters who would have attended or watched the game – we are fully aware that postponements disappoint clubs and fans. The League aims to provide as much clarity as possible, but unfortunately postponements sometimes have to be made at short notice, as safety is our priority. Where possible, the League will endeavour to keep supporters updated if games become at risk.”",Sport/Football,Tottenham v Arsenal postponed as north London derby joins fixture pile-up,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/15/tottenham-v-arsenal-postponed-north-london-derby-joins-fixture-pile-up
