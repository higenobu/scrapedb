5/9/2022,"Normally, it’s not good news when the face of the NBA doesn’t even make the playoffs. When LeBron James’s Los Angeles Lakers failed to advance to the postseason, many thought the product would suffer. Instead, these playoffs have been full of drama and raised the question of whether one of the players starring in this postseason will one day assume James’s mantle. James, after all, is 37 and far closer to the end of his career than the beginning (even if he has a Tom Brady-esque ability to keep Father Time at bay). The second round of the playoffs contains a long list of young players with huge amounts of talent: the Philadelphia 76ers’ Joel Embiid (age 28), the Milwaukee Bucks’ Giannis Antetokounmpo (27), the Phoenix Suns’ Devin Booker (25), the Boston Celtics’ Jayson Tatum (24), the Dallas Mavericks’ Luka Dončić (23) and the Memphis Grizzlies’ Ja Morant (22) (and that’s without mentioning stars such as Nikola Jokic, whose teams are no longer in the postseason). Of those players, the most likely candidate to threaten LeBron’s crown is Giannis, who has already achieved First Name Only status. Right now, the Bucks – playing without noted Celtics-killer Khris Middleton – have a 2-1 series lead over Boston, and much of that has to do with Antetokounmpo playing like the defending finals MVP he is. The Greek Freak already has a championship ring and two league MVPs under his belt, putting him well ahead of the pack as far as career accomplishments. He hasn’t been a slouch this postseason either, with a 50% field goal percentage while averaging 27.9 points, 12.7 rebounds and 7.1 assists. Just last month, Antetokounmpo was named to the NBA’s All-Time European Team alongside another current player in Dončić, who has five fewer seasons under his belt. No one would put the Slovenian wing in Antetokounmpo’s league yet, but Giannis is far closer to a finished product than Dončić, whose ceiling remains tantalizingly high. While Embiid is the oldest player among the group, there’s still a case that he’s such a unique player that he still has only recently found his groove. The 7ft center from Cameroon led the league in scoring during the regular season and his importance to the Sixers has been obvious. In the first round, Embiid hit the game-winning shot against the Toronto Raptors in overtime in Game 3 which changed the course of the entire series. In the second round, Embiid’s double-double in his unexpected return from concussion protocols in Game 3 against the Miami Heat helped save Philadelphia from going down 0-3 in their semifinals series. Injuries, of course, are always a story in the NBA and the Grizzlies may have just suffered the biggest of them all. Until Saturday night, Ja Morant, 2021-22’s Most Improved Player, was in the middle of one of the biggest coming-out parties in recent NBA memory. The second pick in the 2019 draft, Morant – who plays the game in a highly entertaining, madcap style that’s as effective as it is fun to watch – had a 47-point performance in Memphis’s victory in Game 2 against the Warriors, outplaying Steph Curry. He was putting together a similar stat sheet in Game 3, scoring 34 points in 36 minutes, before suffering a knee injury after being grabbed by Golden State’s Jordan Poole in a controversial play. The Grizzlies lost 142-112, but the potential absence of the most exciting player in this postseason may be a bigger blow than the L. If Booker and Tatum haven’t received quite the same amount of attention as the other players on this list during these playoffs, it’s partly because they have been sharing the spotlight. The big story on this Suns team hasn’t been Booker but 37-year-old Chris Paul, who was denied his first ring in last year’s NBA finals and seems even more determined to win one this year. It’s not all about the youngsters this postseason, after all. Meanwhile, Tatum – who is coming off a dreadful performance in the Celtics’ Game 3 loss to the Bucks – is usually mentioned as part of a tandem with older teammate Jaylen Brown, whom he’s played alongside his entire career. That’s not to say that Tatum hasn’t had his moments to shine over the last month: his game-winning buzzer-beater against Kyrie Irving and the Brooklyn Nets, way back in Boston’s first playoff game, will forever be part of his highlight reel. So, which one of these players is most likely to be The Next LeBron? The real answer is none of them, but that’s not a criticism. The truth is that there’s not going to be another LeBron James because once you reach that level of superstardom, you fully emerge from the shadows cast by your predecessors. When James came to the NBA straight out of high school, he came pre-anointed as “King James,” the player who would save basketball. He was going to be, they said, the next Michael Jordan. As good as he was, he never was the Next MJ. That wasn’t because he wasn’t a worthy heir to MJ’s throne – in fact, he’s already established himself as one of the few NBA players that could challenge Jordan’s title as the GOAT – but because he established himself as the First LeBron. Jordan was unique because of his ruthless commitment to winning, the way he transformed the NBA into a league with global popularity and how he forever changed the way athletes market themselves. James, meanwhile, attained national fame while he was still at high school and revived memories of Muhammad Ali and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar by marrying his superb athletic skills with activism. If Antetokounmpo, for instance, lives up to the hype that surrounded him when he entered the league (and he has and then some up to this point) the versatile big man is such a singular player that he wouldn’t become the Next LeBron. He would become the First Giannis. The same would apply to any of the other players mentioned here. The truly great ones don’t follow established paths, they blaze entirely new ones.",Sport/Sport,We won’t find the Next LeBron James in these playoffs (and that’s OK),https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/09/nba-playoffs-lebron-james-giannis-antetokounmpo-basketball
5/9/2022,"It has already been a very wet autumn in eastern Australia. Now further heavy rain will bring the potential for flooding in the north-east of the country over the next few days. La Niña has been the main driver behind the wet weather across Australia during what is autumn in the southern hemisphere. During a La Niña event, the sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific are colder than normal, meaning that the usual easterly winds across the equator are strengthened. The result of this is that more moisture is fed into north-eastern parts of Australia in particular, with an increase in associated heavy rainfall events. This is what has been seen for much of the last couple of months in Australia, after Brisbane on the east coast broke its three-day and seven-day rainfall records back in the last week of February. Low pressure has and will continue to affect northern parts of Australia, with east or north-easterly winds feeding in from the Pacific, helping to seed heavy rain. Some parts of central Queensland recorded 100-150mm of rainfall on Monday. And the north-eastcoast between Townsville and Yeppoon could get 150-200mm quite widely in the 24 hours to 6am on Wednesday, with the potential locally for 200-300mm as the low pressure system moves eastwards out into the Pacific. This level of rainfall is likely to lead to widespread flooding in this area. This area of low pressure is expected to sink southwards down the east coast over the next few days and although the intensity of rain will ease, the system will bring some strong winds down the east coast with the potential for gusts to exceed 50mph. Meanwhile, the intense heatwave across India is expected to continue through the rest of this week with temperatures perhaps exceeding 50C in some northern areas. In stark contrast, farther east across China temperatures will remain well below average over the next few days. A persistent north-easterly wind will keep daytime maximum temperatures in the teens rather than the mid to high 20s celsius expected at this time of year.",News/Environment,Flooding fears as La Niña brings heavy rain to north-east Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/09/flooding-fears-la-nina-heavy-rain-north-east-australia
5/9/2022,"The French Canadian Claude Vivier died in Paris in 1983, at the age of just 34. For a number of years afterwards the gruesome circumstances of his death – stabbed by a 19-year-old man he had invited to spend the night with him – and the fact that Vivier seemed to have anticipated it, seemed to be more widely known than any of his music. But his reputation has steadily grown, and though British performances of his works remain relatively rare, he is often claimed as one of the most significant composers of the second half of the 20th century. The Southbank Centre’s series devoted to Vivier’s music provided an opportunity to assess those claims. Shared between the combined forces of the London Sinfonietta and the Royal Academy of Music’s Manson Ensemble, and Soundstreams, the Toronto-based company dedicated to promoting and performing contemporary Canadian music, the programmes took in a variety of Vivier’s works, alongside new pieces by Canadian composers, though the impression left as a whole remained unconvincing. The first of the Soundstreams programmes focused on Vivier pieces from the late 1970s, when he was still assimilating the different influences in his music – a Roman Catholic upbringing in Montreal, two years studying with Stockhausen in Cologne, travels through Asia, especially to Japan and Bali, and a first encounter in Paris with the early spectralist techniques of such composers as Tristan Murail and Gérard Grisey. So Stockhausen’s Stimmung is the clear starting point for Love Songs for seven singers, though Vivier’s ragbag of vocal techniques and a multilingual patchwork of texts is far more amorphous and unruly than that masterpiece. And the ninth of Stockhausen’s piano pieces is behind at least the opening passages of the solo-piano Shiraz, with its swirling torrents of chords, which were brilliantly projected here by Serouj Kradjian, while in Cinq Chansons for percussion (played by Ryan Scott and, like the piano piece, accompanied by a dance film by Michael Greyeyes) the sound world too obviously comes from Balinese gamelan. If those pieces never really transcend their models, then around 1980 all those elements in Vivier’s music fused into an utterly distinctive style. The two pieces that Ilan Volkov conducted in the Sinfonietta’s programme, Zipangu, for 14 strings, and Lonely Child for soprano and orchestra, explore a world of complex harmonies and glowing instrumental colours that clothe the rhythmic unisons of the string piece and support the vocal lines of Lonely Child in a way that is both ritualistic and consoling. Claire Booth was the wonderfully warm soloist in Lonely Child; it’s quite unlike anything else, and Vivier’s best known work for good reason.",Arts/Music,Claude Vivier weekend review – unruly and utterly distinctive,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/09/claude-vivier-weekend-review-southbank-utterly-distinctive
5/9/2022,"If there was ever an Armenian new wave or maybe an Armenian absurdist wave, then this sprightly and bittersweet 1969 movie – now revived by the Klassiki streaming service as part of a season of Armenian cinema – would be at the vanguard. It was adapted by the Armenian writer Hrant Matevosyan from his own novel and directed by Henrik Malyan. It’s an elegant, elusive parable of a movie about power and the state. The deadpan coup de cinéma that opens the film is rather brilliant: a frenzied montage of all the exciting things that are happening in the 1960s – pop music, dancing, sports. But all of it is suddenly snuffed out with a hard cut to the silent rural world of the Armenian highlands where four shepherds are living the same tough, unsexy existence as their forefathers: droll, dyspeptic Ishkhan (Frunzik Mkrtchyan), truculent Pavle (Khoren Abrahamyan), melancholy widower Avag (Azat Sherents) and university graduate Zaven (Armen Ayvazyan), whose habit it is to slaughter sheep while invoking the words of Shakespeare’s Othello: “… in Aleppo once, / Where a malignant and a turban’d Turk / Beat a Venetian and traduced the state, / I took by th’throat the circumcised dog / And smote him, thus … ” These are lines that resonate among Armenians who presumed to traduce the Soviet state. Bitterly cold and hungry one night, Ishkhan finds some stray and apparently ownerless sheep and slaughters them to provide a welcome barbecue for him and all his fellow shepherds shivering on the hillside. But then another shepherd, Revaz (Artavazd Peleshian), comes along, asking if anyone has seen his stray sheep. With a mixture of mockery, defiance and embarrassment, Ishkhan and the others tell the furious Revaz they have eaten his sheep and give him an inadequate amount in payment and Revaz furiously storms off. The next day, an officious police inspector (Sos Sargsyan) is round at Ravez’s house and is bemused and infuriated at Ravez’s refusal to press charges. This policeman makes it his business to solve the crime and bring the wrongdoers to book: he will not tolerate this primitive world of chaotic hearsay among shepherds and will impose the rational technocratic might of the Soviet state – often grumpily breaking out in Russian as he does so. But he needs clear statements from all four, clear descriptions of the crime, clear confessions or clear witness statements.However, it is quite impossible. The shepherds are evasive, garrulous and sarcastic and the inspector, like a colonial governor gradually going native, is less and less inclined to press the point. Finally, at a mock trial involving the five men up on the mountains they air their grievances at a Soviet state that takes their labour and their produce – in this case, sheep – and which regards any deviance as a kind of ideological theft. There is a sly wit and philosophical humour in this film, a kind of Zen satire at the expense of the forces of law and order. The officer is also obsessed with a case in which a man who was accused of stealing his wife’s wedding ring to pay for his boozing was sent to a labour camp: there is no such thing as private marital business where the Soviet state is concerned, and even to insist on such a thing is a serious offence. And finally, those sheep themselves are an ambiguous symbol: do they stand for the conformism that the authorities require? Or are they wild, untameable and unmanageable? This is a shrewd political pastoral.

5/9/2022,"For a driver of a broken-down car waiting next to a main road with children, the sight of a recovery vehicle is an enormous relief, and a sign that the journey home can begin. But that journey may not be straightforward. For many families, the trip may involve clambering in and out of the cabs of several flatbed trucks. There may also be difficulties caused by the time of day, where you are in the country when you break down, where you live, and even how long the driver who picks you up has been on the road. If a vehicle can’t be repaired, then drivers may be offered a lift home – but not necessarily on one truck. Families have found themselves being moved from one vehicle to another as their journey is broken into stages. There are a number of reasons for this. One is that UK law limits the amount of time that truck drivers can spend on a public road to 10 hours a day and stipulates that a 30-minute break has to be taken after five and a half hours. If a driver is near the end of a shift or is due a break, this will limit the distance that he or she can travel. Steve Jones of Comparison Creator, which provides details of breakdown cover to comparison sites such as Comparethemarket and Moneysupermarket, says many of the companies use networks of recovery vehicles which operate within geographical regions – such as the north-east or Wales – and only within those boundaries. “If you move from one network to another, more often than not it will be passed over to the next network,” he says. Which means you and your car being switched to another breakdown vehicle. The biggest players, the RAC and AA, operate their own network of breakdown vehicles, but both say that longer recovery journeys may have to be conducted in stages to comply with the law. The AA says: “Some members’ journeys home may have to be broken up to comply with government drivers’-hours rules or to work with availability of recovery vehicles in the area.” For families hoping to get home, it’s not always clear beforehand that the journey may be a relay rather than a single drive: the small print in policies often promises to bring passengers home, but does not say how. Something that may be in the terms and conditions, however, is a limit on how many miles you can be taken without having to pay. When Stuart Anderson, who works in public relations, was 12 miles from home his car died, leaving him and his family at the side of the road. Because he had only basic breakdown cover, the recovery driver told him he could take him 10 miles free of charge, but after that he would have to pay a per-mile fee. “At the end, he dumped the car outside the house and got his card machine out,” says Anderson. His problem was that his policy was limited to what is called “local recovery”. If you’re travelling longer distances, buying national cover is the way to ensure you can get all the way home wherever you break down. If the car can’t be fixed at the roadside, these policies should at least cover all the passengers being taken home, but they will cost more than a basic policy. However, Jones points out that some providers will only take drivers to their home and not to the destination they were travelling to. “[If] I’m in Cardiff … and I break down in Bristol on the way to Edinburgh, and my vehicle can’t be repaired at the roadside, most decent policies would take me either back home or to Edinburgh,” he says. However, “there’s a lot of companies that don’t do that [Edinburgh] part of it: they restrict it.” In a race to offer the most competitive prices, providers have been bringing in excess charges on some of their products, similar to insurance policies. This means that while a policy may appear cheap, should you end up having to call a truck to recover your car, a fee – typically of about £40 – will have to be paid. If your vehicle breaks down at home or within a short distance of it – such as a quarter of a mile – your policy may not cover that either. “Home start” is an additional feature on some policies where a mechanic is sent to your house. Because of the new technology involved in electric vehicles, the amount of work which can be done on them at the roadside is limited, says Jones, and they often have to be taken to a garage. “There are a lot of issues with electrics at the moment, so it is about making sure that you have the right cover,” he says. “Most people think that a van can turn up and give you a full charge, [but] the battery packs that they use on the vans would take a half-hour or 40 minutes just to get you to the next electric charge station. You have to make sure that you know what is covered and what is not.” The average price of a breakdown cover package on the comparison sites is about £42, but the cheapest policies tend not to include features such as national cover, and may also include an excess fee. For a policy with national cover and no excess, the average price starts at about £50 a year, says Jones. The AA says its cover begins at £59 for new customers on a basic policy, which includes having their vehicle towed to a local garage. The price goes up for features such as national recovery, onward travel and additional drivers. There is no extra charge for electric vehicles. The RAC’s standard membership starts at £63.25 a year under a promotion that is currently running. The normal cost of this cover is £104.50. This includes cover for breakdowns at the home but does not include features such as onward travel or national recovery. Martin Lewis’s MoneySavingExpert site recommends AutoAid’s policy, which starts at £61.49 for a driver and their spouse in any vehicle they are driving. It offers recovery to any UK destination if the vehicle cannot be repaired by the end of a working day.",Lifestyle/Money,"Nervous breakdowns: if your car goes wrong, is your policy up to it?

5/9/2022,"Members on the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack on 6 January are moving closer to issuing subpoenas to Republican members of Congress to compel their cooperation in the inquiry – though it has started to dawn on them that they may be out of time. The panel is expected to make a final decision on the subpoena question over the next couple of weeks, according to sources directly familiar with internal deliberations, with House investigators needing to start wrapping up their work ahead of public hearings in June. While the members on the select committee remain undecided about whether to subpoena Republican members of Congress, their refusal to assist the investigation in any form has caused the sentiment to turn towards taking that near-unprecedented action, the sources said. The shifting view has come as a result of the dismay among the members in January, when House minority leader Kevin McCarthy and others turned down requests for voluntary cooperation, turning to anger after three more of Donald Trump’s allies last week refused to cooperate. What has changed in recent weeks in the select committee’s assessment is that they cannot ignore the deep involvement between some Republican members of Congress and the former president’s unlawful schemes to overturn the results of the 2020 election, the sources said. The recent letters to House Republicans Mo Brooks, Andy Biggs and Ronny Jackson – Trump’s former White House doctor – provided just a snapshot of the entanglement, the sources said, with the Trump White House, and potentially the militia groups that attacked the Capitol. House investigators are particularly interested in any potential connections between Republican members of Congress and the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys militia groups, the sources said, since those groups were actually involved in the riot element of January 6. The select committee wanted to interview Jackson, for instance, to establish how the Oath Keepers came to learn as they stormed the Capitol that he had “critical data to protect” and needed “protection”, according to text messages revealed in court filings. But the panel has been holding off compelling that information with subpoenas, anxious about the inevitable circus that would accompany such a move and, as the Guardian reported in January, embolden Republicans to subpoena Democrats if they take the House in 2022. The select committee told itself, the sources said, it might be able to avoid the issue altogether if it could get the information it needed from other places, like it did with Trump’s former chief of staff Mark Meadows when his aides provided testimony. But that has not happened, and especially not with respect to the issue of potential connections between Republican members of Congress and the militia groups, whose members are now largely unable to talk to the panel having been placed under criminal investigation by the DoJ. The trouble for the select committee is that it may have run out of time to go down the subpoena route. Even if the panel were now to issue a bevy of subpoenas to House Republicans, if their colleagues decide to ignore the subpoenas, the only real option it has to enforce the orders would be to pursue action through the slow-grinding cogs of the judicial system. That enforcement mechanism would likely take months, according to former prosecutors – an exercise potentially of little use to a panel that is seeking to start wrapping up depositions before public hearings in June and expects to publish a final report in September. But some members believe Republicans may just cooperate if they are subpoenaed, the sources said, since Republican subpoenas to Democrats in a future investigation would only have teeth if Republicans don’t defang the very congressional subpoenas first – by defying them.",News/US news,Capitol attack panel moves closer to issuing subpoenas to Republicans ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/09/capitol-attack-panel-subpoenas-republicans
5/9/2022,"Now then, on a scale of 0 to 10: do you seek out beauty in your everyday life? Do you know what CS Lewis meant when he described joy as a “sharp, wonderful stab of longing”? Do you react intensely to music or art or nature? Are you moved by old photographs? Do you experience happiness and sadness simultaneously? If your answer is emphatically yes to these and similar questions in Susan Cain’s Bittersweet Quiz (I came to a jarring halt at the one about being perceived as an “old soul”), then you will score highly and qualify as a “true connoisseur of the place where light and dark meet”. You are not sanguine (robust, forward-leaning, ambitious, combat-ready, tough), but bittersweet – and to be bittersweet means to be sensitive, creative and spiritual, with a “tendency to states of longing, poignancy and sorrow; an acute awareness of passing time; and a curiously piercing joy at the beauty of the world”. Bittersweet, writes Susan Cain with her startling sincerity, means the transformation of pain into “creativity, transcendence and love”. In Quiet, Cain argued that we undervalue inward-looking, reflective, dreamy introverts in favour of the loud extrovert, who is gregarious, confident, bold, thick-skinned and successful. Bittersweet – a kind, optimistic and unflaggingly earnest book, not a fleck of humour on the horizon – is really a variation on the same theme and uses the same doubtful binary model. While the sanguine are the cheerful toughies in charge of the world, bittersweet is a neglected but truly beautiful quality. It’s the compassion instinct, it’s sadness, it’s modesty, it’s hidden suffering and quietness and the plangent allure of the happy-sad, the oh-so-aching sense of time passing. It’s Leonard Cohen (Cain is ardent for Cohen, her troubadour of pessimism, which actually made me question my own love for him), Aristotle, sufism, Pippi Longstocking, Baudelaire, Nina Simone, the Qur’an and the Bible, Plato, Rumi, meditations, Maya Angelou… Like Quiet, Bittersweet is an easy-on-the-ego hybrid of genres. Cain turns to other people’s stories as well as her own (her best and plainest writing is reserved for her own losses). She plaits these narratives together with research, philosophy, psychology, art and religion. Her statements about literature often made me blink (how does she know that Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet out of longing?). Gobbets of wisdom are scooped out of their necessary context and deployed to teach a crucial lesson: attend to the bittersweet; feeling the longing inside you. Because really this is a motivational book, sometimes like an expanded Ted Talk, each chapter drawing to a climax of kindness and connectivity with others, and often like a how-to manual designed to help the reader come closer to their vulnerable core: ask yourself what you’re longing for, have a go at this online guided version of loving-kindness meditation and here are seven ways of coping with loss… There’s something for everyone in this pick’n’mix feel-sad, feel-good assemblage. Cain wants a kinder, deeper, more connected and creative world. She has obviously thrown herself heart and soul into writing a book that will draw us together. But Bittersweet – much of which I cannot disagree with – did not uplift me. It depressed me and also made me feel grumpy. Its unflagging earnestness and sweetness of spirit flattens the terrain; everything feels like topsoil and nothing can grow deep roots. With her belief in the fundamental bittersweetness of us all, Cain seeks to erase differences between political groups, rich and poor (I don’t understand why she turned to Princeton colleagues, industry leaders or the House of Beautiful Business for her examples or attended motivational workshops in Silicon Valley where privileged people could discover their secret wounds), between cultures and classes and religions. She also blithely fails to discriminate between the profound and the mawkish or charlatan: Romeo and Juliet sits cheek by jowl with The Bridges of Madison County, Freud with pop psychology. There are quotations from St Augustine or Charles Darwin and also platitudes such as “longing is the gateway to belonging” or “we are all reaching for the heavens”. I’m all for the bittersweet – I love rainy days and sad songs too and drone Leonard Cohen songs on my bike – but after reading this book my longing was for the earth: for the salt of irony, for specificity, anger, doubt and laughter.

5/9/2022,"Clive Palmer’s United Australia party will preference the Liberals and Nationals ahead of Labor in a swathe of key marginal seats, in a boost to Scott Morrison’s election prospects. Despite Palmer previously promising the party would preference all incumbents last as part of his concerted campaign against the two major parties, UAP has decided to direct preferences to at least three Liberal incumbent MPs in key marginal seats, including Gladys Liu in Chisholm, Fiona Martin in Reid, and Bridget Archer in Bass. It will also support Liberal incumbents Jason Falinski in Mackellar and Dave Sharma in Wentworth, who are under threat from so-called teal independents, with both candidates trading the second preference position with the UAP. Independent candidates Sophie Scamps in Mackellar and Allegra Spender in Wentworth have both slammed the moderate MPs for the move, and demanded to know details of the “dirty deal” struck between the two parties. In Reid, which Labor is confident of picking up from the Coalition, UAP will initially direct preferences to other minor parties and independent Natalie Baini, but has decided to preference incumbent Liberal MP Fiona Martin ahead of Labor’s Sally Sitou. It will also preference the Coalition in the seat of Hunter, where the Nationals are hoping to win the heartland Labor seat for the first time, and in Gilmore, where the Liberal party is hoping to unseat Labor’s Fiona Phillips. The Liberals’ Andrew Constance has been placed third on the Palmer ticket. In the Hunter, UAP will preference other minor parties including independent candidate Stuart Bonds and One Nation candidate Dale McNamara, before directing preferences to the Nationals’ James Thomson in fifth position. Labor’s Dan Repacholi has been listed eighth on the ticket, ahead of the Greens. The Liberals are also set to benefit from Palmer preferences in the seat of Parramatta where it is hoping to cause an upset with its candidate Maria Kovacic. The UAP candidate Julian Fayad has been campaigning strongly against Labor’s captain’s pick candidate Andrew Charlton, and has previously told the Guardian he intended to preference the Liberals. In Labor’s most marginal seat of Macquarie, held on a 0.2% margin, the Liberals have been placed fourth on the ticket, while Labor has been placed seventh. In Dobell, held by Labor on a 1.5% margin, the Liberal candidate Michael Feneley is ahead of Labor MP Emma McBride. Amid simmering concern about the impact of Palmer preferences on the fringes of Melbourne, UAP has also decided to preference the Liberals in the new seat of Hawke to the city’s west, placing the party in sixth position ahead of Labor’s Sam Rae in the ninth spot. In Western Australia, all incumbents are being preferenced last. In the Labor-held Queensland seat of Blair, Palmer is said to be running an open ticket, and in the Labor-held western Sydney marginal seat of Greenway, the UAP will preference the Labor frontbencher Michelle Rowland ahead of her Liberal challenger. UAP leader Craig Kelly told Guardian Australia that the party had ample volunteers available to hand out how to vote cards, and the party would not need to pay people to man polling booths as it had in previous elections. “These are only recommendations and we are hoping that the way our polling is going and tracking we will finish first or second,” Kelly said. At a press conference on Saturday, Clive Palmer said that the party was preferencing Liberal or “Liberal independents” in 60% of seats, and Labor candidates in 40% of seats. “We are really focusing on our other policy and where people stand on freedom in this country,” he said, pointing to his desire for an Australian bill of rights. “We are looking, when we are giving preferences, to how people stand on those issues and whether they have the courage to support us,” Palmer said.",News/Australia news,United Australia party directs preferences to Coalition in key marginal seats ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/09/united-australia-party-directs-preferences-to-coalition-in-key-marginal-seats
5/9/2022,"There is still no evidence Keir Starmer broke Covid rules with a beer and a takeaway meal during a campaign visit to Durham last year, a senior shadow minister has said, saying it was “ludicrous” to suggest the Labour leader was avoiding scrutiny over the issue. Starmer had been scheduled to attend an Institute for Government event on Monday but has pulled out. Wes Streeting, the shadow education secretary, said he did not know why the decision had been made. “No idea,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “And I didn’t ask before I came on because I just thought it was such a trivial issue. I do think the idea that Keir has been somehow ducking scrutiny on this is ludicrous, given he has been in front of the cameras repeatedly over the weekend.” Labour has not said why Starmer pulled out of the event. The event in April 2021, in which Starmer was filmed inside a Durham Labour constituency office holding a beer while people behind him carried plates of food, was examined by local police earlier this year, who said at the time no Covid rules were breached. But following what the force said was the receipt of “significant” new evidence, Durham police announced last week they were looking again at any potential offences. It remains unclear what this evidence might be, but over the weekend the Mail on Sunday published extracts from a Labour campaign memo from the period, which set out the timetable for Starmer’s visit, including a scheduled time for a meal. Asked if this undermined Labour’s argument that Starmer was working amid the meal, Streeting said the memo was a “standard visit plan” for such campaigns “I don’t think anything that I saw in the memo in the Mail contradicted anything that Keir Starmer has said,” Streeting said. “It was a perfectly reasonable thing to do. The only thing I can do is to applaud the Mail for their ingenuity in turning a totally uncontroversial memo into something they are dropping as some kind of great revelation. I just don’t think it is.” He continued: “I really don’t think that what we have seen, what we’re discussing, is in any way comparable with what we saw in No 10, which is why Boris Johnson was fined, and which is why the public were so angry about suitcases full of booze being wheeled in by officials. It’s just not the same thing. “I do think we have moral authority to criticise the government, because Boris Johnson has been fined and found guilty of wrongdoing, and Boris Johnson has been proven to have lied to the House of Commons. Keir Starmer has never denied he was in Durham, never denied he stopped for dinner. Boris Johnson denied that there were any parties in No 10.” Streeting said the fact the memo did not set out specific tasks to be done by Starmer after the takeaway did not mean the Labour leader had, by then, stopped work. “It’s no surprise to any of us who have worked on election campaigns that you might pause for food and you go back to work, you work late,” he said. Starmer was, Streeting added, “someone of integrity, decency and honesty”, and he was “not even entertaining the prospect” of a fine being levied. The universities minister, Michelle Donelan, told Sky News the fact Starmer was being investigated “smacks of sheer hypocrisy given the relentless focus he has placed on Partygate”. Asked if he should resign if fined, she said: “He’s going to have to search his soul after making this a top priority over the last few months at the expense of key issues like the rising cost of living.”",News/Politics,"No evidence Keir Starmer broke Covid rules, says shadow minister",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/09/keir-starmer-covid-rules-wes-streeting-labour
5/9/2022,"Is it a sitcom? A Narnian fantasy? A Tarantino-esque bloodbath? This new play by Mikey Burnett and Joe McCann has not made up its mind and, surprisingly, that’s not altogether a bad thing. The Bookies is an uneven show, but every time you think you have it sussed, it surprises you. The setting is an Edinburgh betting shop, a once independent business now part of a less welcoming chain. Branch manager Pat (Ewan Donald) thinks he is in line for a star-employee bonus, but his status-hungry boss Michelle (Irene Macdougall), has other ideas. While they talk at cross-purposes, the shop’s sole gambler, injured climber Harry (Antony Strachan valiantly standing in for an unwell Barrie Hunter) sinks his savings into a high-stakes machine. Beneath the breezy comedy lie three themes. The first is to do with the lust for easy money that makes the staff no different from the gamblers they serve. Second is some metaphysical idea about the desire to conquer impossible odds, be it mountains or betting terminals. And third is about race: black staff member John (Benjamin Osugo) puts up with his white colleagues’ tokenism only because he plans to escape to university. No shortage of potential there, but none of the themes is fully realised. The allure of money has more to do with plot twists than political commentary; Harry’s magical-realist fixation with Everest is intriguing but peculiar; and John’s complaints about racist microaggressions come too late to have much impact. All the same, on Kenny Miller’s realistic set, with its cheap-and-cheerful orange fittings, director Sally Reid pulls together a snappy production. In between the heist and the escapism, it remains an odd but enjoyable show.
