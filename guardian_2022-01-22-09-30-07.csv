1/22/2022,"The average age for joining the property ladder in Britain has risen to above 30 in every region of the country, as surging house prices mean first-time buyers must save for longer before they can afford their own home. Halifax, the UK’s biggest mortgage lender, said the national average for a first home purchase had risen to 32 in 2021 from 29 a decade earlier, and was above 30 for every region.  Despite a record year for growth in first-time buyers, with an increase of more than a third compared with 2020, it said rising average house prices meant waiting longer to become a homeowner than in previous generations. The average age remains highest in London, at 33, although it has only risen by a year in the past decade. Other regions have recorded a sharper increase, including a three-year jump in Wales to 31, and a rise of two years to 30 and 31 in the north-east and north-west of England. Esther Dijkstra, the mortgage director at Halifax, said the difficulty of raising a deposit, rising property prices and changing lifestyle factors were pushing back the date at which people bought their first home. “Over time more people have chosen to go on to higher education, go travelling, or move around for work, which are all factors in the increase in first-time buyer age,” she said. “However, undoubtedly, the biggest drivers are the cost of homes and the need to save a significant deposit to get on the housing ladder. In 2021, the increase in average house price to £264,140, combined with difficulties in raising a deposit, meant that the gap between purchase price and deposit widened in every region in the UK.” Halifax said the number of people buying their first home rose at a record rate in 2021, soaring by 35% to 409,370 – the biggest jump on records dating back to 2006 – despite surging property prices. Dijkstra said it was clear the government’s stamp duty holiday had increased the availability of first-rung homes as others moved up the property ladder. First-time buyers benefited from full relief when purchasing a home worth up to £300,000 and a reduced rate up to £500,000. The figures come as ministers push to support first-time buyers, including through the government’s help-to-buy scheme. The Bank of England is also considering watering down mortgage affordability rules in a development that could help more people on to the property ladder. Rates of homeownership among young adults have fallen dramatically in recent decades, plunging from a peak of 51% in 1989 to just 25% in 2016, according to the Resolution Foundation. Rates have risen slightly in recent years to 28% in 2019. Halifax said the price of an average first-time buyer home was less than four times the average income – considered the limit for affordability under rules set by UK financial regulators – in just 15 local authorities.",Lifestyle/Money,"Average UK first-time buyer is now older than 30, says Halifax",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/22/average-uk-first-time-buyer-is-now-older-than-30-says-halifax
1/22/2022,"Employees at Raven Software, a video game studio owned by Activision Blizzard, announced Friday they have formed a union – a milestone in a largely unorganized industry recently marred by labor complaints.  Several dozen employees of the Wisconsin studio, which is behind the massively popular Call of Duty series, voted in favor of the union. The news comes just days after Microsoft announced it would acquire Activision Blizzard for $70bn. Though the union represents a small portion of nearly 10,000 Activision Blizzard employees, the vote is significant in light of the Microsoft acquisition, said Robert Bies, a professor of management at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. “This is a big time event in an industry that does not have many unions,” he said. “This is the beginning of a trend where people want to be heard in the workplace.” Friday’s announcement comes after at least 60 employees at Raven staged a walkout in December 2021 to protest layoffs of contract workers they said were unfair. “We want to see changes that reflect the wants and needs of both the gaming community and the workers who create these incredible products,”Brent Reel, a quality assurance employee at Raven, said in a statement The union, called the Game Workers Alliance Union, would be the first at a publicly traded video game publisher and only the second video game union in the US. It will be part of the Communications Workers of America, the largest union in the media industry. The unionization effort comes on the heels of a tumultuous year for Activision Blizzard, during which it was sued by California’s department of fair employment and housing for discrimination and harassment claims. That suit alleged women across the company were paid less than men and “assigned to lower paid and lower opportunity levels”. It also alleged a “frat boy” workplace culture in which men got drunk at work and crawled into women’s cubicles to harass them. A spokesman from Activision Blizzard said the company is “carefully reviewing the request for voluntary recognition”. The union is giving the company until 25 January to respond. “While we believe that a direct relationship between the company and its team members delivers the strongest workforce opportunities, we deeply respect the rights of all employees under the law to make their own decisions about whether or not to join a union,” the Activision Blizzard spokesman said. The spokesman added that in the past two years, Activision Blizzard raised minimum compensation for Raven QA employees and extended other benefits. Experts say the issues cited in the suit against Activision Blizzard are exacerbated by the high turnover rate of the industry, which often relies on contract and temporary workers. Those same problems make organizing more difficult, said Amanda Cote, professor at University of Oregon and author of Gaming Sexism: Gender and Identity in the Era of Casual Video Games. “A small union is a step, but may not be enough to change overall industrial labor patterns,” she said, but added that this union marks “the first of its kind in the video game industry”.",News/Technology,Activision Blizzard employees form first of its kind Game Workers Alliance Union,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/21/activision-blizzard-employees-union
