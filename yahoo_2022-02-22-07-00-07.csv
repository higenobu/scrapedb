2/22/2022,"With consumer prices soaring by the most in four decades in January, food prices have borne the brunt of skyrocketing inflation — something Smashburger and other food chains have passed along to their customers. In a Yahoo Finance interview, Smashburger president Carl Bachmann cited inflation as ""a challenge"" for the fast-casual chain, but noted several strategies that have helped alleviate price pressures — and sticker shock for consumers. ""We've had to take some very small minor price increases, but we were very strategic about that. The key thing here is really focusing on your supply chain, and making sure that you're managing freight costs, and all of those little pieces of the puzzle behind the scenes to counteract the commodities as they continue to rise,"" he said. Costs for basic food items like chicken, ground beef, and cream cheese have seen significant upswings since the start of the pandemic, rising 3.4% on an annual basis in 2020, and 3.9% in 2021 — a significant gain compared to 2019's 1.9% rise, according to the Consumer Price Index. Bachmann explained that Smashburger has utilized redundant vendors and global partners to ease supply chain constraints which, in turn, has helped curb price strains. ""You've got to work harder at that in order to combat inflation, because there is a point where people won't pay. We want to make sure that we keep our guests happy,"" he continued. So far, Bachmann said he's seen ""slow"" improvements when it comes to the overall supply chain, but that staffing issues still persist — a common phenomenon that the restaurant space knows all too well. ""Once our supply chain has better staffing, they are paying less overtime, they're not struggling for deliveries and I think that's the key,"" the executive said. He added that strength in the supply chain is ""linear"" and its impact can be felt all the way through frontline operations. Since the latest decline in COVID-19 infections, Bachmann said Smashburger has seen a surge in foot traffic. He cited increased ""pent-up demand"" that only got better as Omicron infections waned, boosting in-dining experiences. Yet, consistent growth has remained in delivery, a trend that Bachmann predicts is ""here to stay,"" as well as drive-through expansion. Those trends have been accelerated by the pandemic, and most food chains are leaning into them. Value Perception vs. Price Point Despite a variety of challenges plaguing the industry, Bachmann stressed that the largest risk is neither labor, inflation nor the supply chain — but quality of taste. ""Fast casual operators don't realize how important food quality taste is — vibrant flavors, really making your product line exciting for the consumer,"" he told Yahoo Finance. ""I think people are more careful about where they buy, when they buy, and how they buy [but] if you're going to demand a certain price point, you really have to deliver on bold, vibrant flavors, and really be innovative,"" the executive explained. Smashburger has leaned on digital transformations and third-party delivery companies to add to the overall customer experience — in addition to new menu offerings, like all-day breakfast at select locations and the Scorchin’ Hot Crispy Chicken Sandwich, which sold out at multiple locations in just a few weeks ""During the pandemic, a lot of restaurants shrunk down their menus and and took that as as a direction to save costs. But we decided that was the time to really open up the doors and get exciting, vibrant, and bold flavors, and let people know that they're really getting value."" ""It becomes a value perception piece more than a price point piece,"" he continued. Alexandra is a Producer & Entertainment Correspondent at Yahoo Finance.

2/22/2022,"A plastic surgeon and a nurse anesthetist in Colorado are now facing criminal charges in connection to a disastrous breast augmentation surgery that led to a young woman’s death in October 2020.

Emmalyn Nguyen, 18, underwent the procedure at Dr. Geoffrey Kim’s Colorado Aesthetics and Plastic Surgery in Greenwood Village on Aug. 1, 2019. After receiving anesthesia, she reportedly experienced two cardiac arrests and ended up with brain damage.

Nguyen’s family’s lawyer, David Woodruff, alleged that nurse Rex Meeker had left the then-18-year-old unattended for 15 minutes after administering the anesthesia. Meeker was reportedly involved in a similar incident in 2007.

Kim, who reportedly revived Nguyen after her first cardiac arrest, allegedly misled her family into thinking that “everything is fine.”



“He said everything is fine, Emmalyn is fine, everything is good. She’s young, she’s healthy, she’ll be okay, it’s just taking her long to wake up,” Nguyen’s mother, Lynn Fam, told CBS Denver.

Nguyen remained in a vegetative state prior to her death in October 2020. She reportedly developed pneumonia in her nursing home and went into cardiac arrest multiple times over a 24-hour period.

Last Wednesday, the Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office announced that Kim had surrendered himself over to the police following an arrest warrant. He was charged with criminally negligent homicide and first-degree aggravated assault, both categorized as felonies.

Meeker, on the other hand, was solely charged with manslaughter. A warrant was issued for his arrest, and he remains out of custody at the time of this writing.



“We opened this criminal case in August 2019. The investigation has taken more than two years to complete and involved dozens of interviews and search warrants,” said Captain of Investigations Travis Stewart. “Our hope is that this will be the beginning of bringing justice and a sense of closure to Emmalyn’s family.”

In a statement, the family shared that they are hopeful about ""finally getting justice for Emmalyn.""

“Even though it will never bring our daughter back, at least this will help others from getting hurt and prevent ruining other families' lives,"" the family said, according to CBS News. “We still haven't been able to get closure from Emmalyn's death. Hopefully bringing criminal charges will bring out the truth about what happened and will bring justice for Emmalyn.”

Kim, who turned himself in with his attorney, was later released after posting a $5,000 bond. Last year, he and Meeker agreed to pay $1 million each to Nguyen’s family in a civil settlement, as per CBS Denver.

2/22/2022,"Donald Trump launched Truth Social on Monday, but the app and its rollout did not go without their quirks. Truth Social mimics Twitter’s layout, and is aimed at providing a platform for conservative voices who feel their freedom of speech is not upheld by Twitter, Facebook-now-Meta and other channels. The influx of signups for Truth Social has created a waiting list at least 150,000, CNN reported. Truth Social is available on the Apple App Store, but not for Androids or users outside of the country. The reaction to Trump’s newest venture was not muted on Twitter. “The irony – the ‘Truthers’ are all on Twitter looking for customer service,” one user tweeted. Several reports of bugs, hiccups in the sign up process and ultimately restricted boundaries for downloading the app brought many to scrutinize its development and overall operation. “Social media sadly thrives on conflict,” wrote Lt. Colonel Adam Kinzinger on Twitter. “#truthsocial (which is ironically named) will be boring and fail, because it will be all Trump-fed drones. BUT, please don’t come back to real social media if you left for Trump and Nunes great idea. You get your one shot.” Congressman Ted Lieu mused about the inner workings of the platform, Tweeting, “Many people say that if #TruthSocial can’t even handle opening new accounts, how will it keep your account from being hacked? Also, the problems won’t be fixed until late March. So is their staff like 2 people, the failed Devin Nunes and his cousin’s friend who is the coder?” Many people say that if #TruthSocial can’t even handle opening new accounts, how will it keep your account from being hacked?Also, the problems won’t be fixed until late March. So is their staff like 2 people, the failed Devin Nunes and his cousin’s friend who is the coder? https://t.co/9aZq5ywHna — Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) February 21, 2022 Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene joined Truth Social the day before its launch to the public. “As the only Member of Congress to have had my personal @Twitter account banned, I understand what millions of conservatives have gone through having their personal freedom of speech stolen from them by Big Tech for not parroting the approved messaging,” Greene tweeted. Richard Grennel retweeted one of his earlier Tweets, writing “It’s an overwhelming success. The demand is YUGE. Be patient.” Politician Jon Cooper commented on the slow launch of the app. “Don’t worry, Walter. I would NEVER leave Trump’s new TRUTH Social app a 1 star review. And I’d definitely NEVER write ‘bugs’ in the review,” Cooper tweeted. “Since I know that could cause Apple to remove it from the app store. That would be so wrong. ” Some are comparing the launch to Trump steaks, a project the former president took on back in 2016 that flopped. The operation doubled back on itself when put under investigation, as it looked like Trump was buying steaks and repackaging them as his own for higher prices.
