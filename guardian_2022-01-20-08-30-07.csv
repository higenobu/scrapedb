1/20/2022,"“It’s not really about feeling safe,” Katie explains as she installs the CCTV camera outside her house. Those days are, in essence, behind her. The comfort the cameras offer is that now “if anything happens, there’ll be evidence”. One-in-five women are the victims of stalking in their lifetime – and Katie is one of them. Stalking seems too weak a word to describe the experience that, in the new BBC documentary Stalkers, presented by Stacey Dooley, is quickly shown to amount to a kind of terrorism, even before you learn that it is also the experience of most of the women who are murdered every year in the UK.  Katie’s ordeal began when she ended a five-month relationship and her ex began bombarding her with threatening messages, turning up at her house, lying to the police about her harassing him and finding various other ways to intimidate her and her family. He was given a two-year sentence for stalking and perverting the course of justice and is due out any day, after serving less than a third of it. Statistics show that 50% of all convicted stalkers re-offend. “We have to prepare for the worst,” explains Mahbuba, from the charity Aurora New Dawn which works with the police to try to help women whose lives are being destroyed by psychological torture from embittered exes or fixated strangers. “We need to be realistic. He could be angry, vengeful. We don’t know who he’s spoken to in prison.” Hence the cameras. And the advice to clients to keep a go-bag packed with essentials in the car in case they need to make a quick getaway. Dooley, with her unforced charm and gentle spirit, is the perfect presenter for such an intimate and emotional subject. She is warm, she engages without ego, and she has that ineffable gift known as the common touch. Her compassion never descends into sentimentality, and it draws out the best in vulnerable people without leaving them overexposed. She gets accused of being a lightweight and a dilettante – apparently, it seems, because she has a cockney accent. People can be snobs and idiots – let the revolution begin. The several stories Dooley follows over months play out with grim similarity: 28-year-old Claire’s ex-boyfriend (just shy of 50% of stalkers are previous partners) began stalking her 18 months after they split up. Hers is one of the utterly terrified and terrifying 999 calls we hear, begging for help. A 25-year-old single mother Sabrina started receiving anonymous, frightening calls and messages, plus pictures taken outside her house. She was sent assurances that the caller knew where her daughter went to school, and lists of locations she had been to that day. Eventually she discovered they were coming from her ex, but unlike Claire’s and Katie’s, theirs had been a good relationship. “He was lovely,” says Sabrina. “We just didn’t work out.” As the special police unit in Cheshire (one of the tiny handful in the country that specialises in stalker cases), Aurora New Dawn and, of course, countless other charities, refuges and women know, hell hath no fury like a man, as he sees it, scorned. “A lot of them feel entitled to be in a relationship,” says Mahbuba, “and have that person next to them.” Gathering evidence and building cases against the perpetrators – which involves establishing a pattern of behaviour rather than just proving single incidents – is painstaking work for the police and another feat of endurance required from the victims. Any convictions tend to result in risibly short sentences and restraining orders that are usually broken swiftly and without consequence. A breakdown in technical equipment when Amanda went to court meant that the CCTV evidence she had against her stalker wasn’t played. He got community service and a restraining order. She now rarely leaves her house, so closely does her stalker monitor her movements from just beyond the boundary of his order. The programme fell short, as most of these programmes do, in placing the phenomenon in a wider context and asking broader questions about the society that breeds them. Such as: what makes men feel so entitled to women? If it were predominantly men who lived with this kind of terror – and, more insidiously, the fear of becoming its focus, which is woven like a malevolent thread through the tapestry of female experience as a whole – would we see such light sentencing, such dismissive attitudes, such a dearth of specialised responses, interventions, punishment? Would we expect them to learn to live, as 20% of women will, an indeterminate sentence in a prison without walls? I wonder. No, not really. I don’t wonder at all.",Arts/Television & radio,Stalkers review – Stacey Dooley is perfect in this utterly terrifying documentary,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/19/stalkers-review-stacey-dooley-is-perfect-in-this-utterly-terrifying-documentary
1/20/2022,"Joe Biden on Wednesday conceded that the unshakable threat of the Covid-19 pandemic had left many Americans demoralized, but insisted that his administration had “outperformed” expectations despite the myriad crises facing the nation during his first year in office. Speaking to reporters in the East Room of the White House for his first solo news conference in months, the US president said he was confident Democrats could pass “big chunks” of his sprawling domestic policy bill currently stalled in the Senate before the 2022 midterm elections.  But Biden spoke as Senate Democrats were pressing ahead with what appeared to be a hopeless attempt to enact voting rights protections over unified Republican opposition. “It’s been a year of challenges but it’s also been a year of enormous progress,” Biden said, outlining the administration’s early successes: passing coronavirus relief aid that slashed child poverty rates and a bipartisan infrastructure law that will shower funding for major public works projects on every state in the nation. Biden was also realistic about the difficult road ahead, as the extremely contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus overwhelms hospitals, inflation rises and his agenda languishes before a Congress controlled by Democrats. “After almost two years of physical, emotional and psychological impact of this pandemic, for many of us, it’s been too much to bear,” he said. “Some people may call what’s happening now ‘the new normal’. I call it a job not yet finished. It will get better.” Grading his efforts to combat the pandemic, Biden insisted the US was better positioned now than when he took office, while acknowledging mistakes, such as not ordering more tests earlier. He vowed the US would not go back to the earliest days of the pandemic when lockdowns and school closures were widespread. Wednesday’s press conference was his 10th since taking office, far fewer than his most recent predecessors. Only a limited number of journalists were credentialed for the press conference, and all were required to wear masks, a reminder of the virus’s continuing threat. In the coming weeks, Biden said he would travel to states and districts across the country to promote his agenda and sell his administration’s accomplishments, trying to correct what he described as a communication failure. He believed key pieces of his Build Back Better agenda could pass the Senate, including popular plans to combat climate change and create a universal pre-kindergarten program. Biden bristled at the notion that his agenda was progressive or radical in any way. “I’m not asking for castles in the sky,” Biden said. “I’m asking for practical things the American people have been asking for for a long time.” Biden assailed Republicans for obstructing his agenda, accusing the party of lacking a policy core. “What are Republicans for? What are they for? Name me one thing they’re for?” Biden asked. Biden was unequivocal when asked whether Vice-President Kamala Harris would again be his running mate in 2024. “Yes,” he replied. Asked how he could win back independent voters who supported him in 2020 but have become disillusioned with his leadership so far, Biden pushed back. “I don’t believe the polls.”",News/US news,Joe Biden says his administration has ‘outperformed’ in bruising first year,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/19/joe-biden-first-year-press-conference-coronavirus

Congratulations to all those who managed to get dressed today, and welcome to a gently fashion-themed edition of Five Great Reads, your weekday summer wrap of great writing and service journalism, styled by me, Alyx Gorman, Guardian Australia’s lifestyle editor, currently wearing a cape in honour of André Leon Talley.

And if you’d just like to eat some beans, Felicity Cloake has the perfect recipe for baking them Boston-style. Now, on to the reads. In order to fulfil a seemingly endless appetite for fish oil supplements, some in the fishing industry are looking further and further down the food chain, to zooplankton. Is that a problem? It could be. While advocates argue harvesting zooplankton doesn’t have an impact on the ecosystem; the industry’s growth potential has scientists (and other fishers) worried. Notable quote: “They have in mind getting the technology to the place where they can actually go out and really exploit it,” says Peter Wiebe, scientist emeritus at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. “And I think, without the kind of studies that are needed to understand the dynamics of the populations there, we do that foolhardily.” How long will it take me to read? About four minutes. As tens of thousands of Australians manage their Covid symptoms from home, demand for blood oxygen monitoring devises is spiking. Donna Lu explains what an oximeter does, and what to do if you can’t get one. Can I just use my phone or smart watch? No. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has warned that these “are not accurate and should not be used”. So what can I do? In the absence of an oximeter, Dr Suzi Nou, an anaesthetist in Melbourne who has been managing Covid patients in the community, suggests looking for other signs of low blood oxygen, such as trouble with breathing, blue-tinged lips or extremities, and difficulty completing sentences or getting up the stairs. “They would be very strong signs that there’s not enough oxygen in their body.” Yesterday, groundbreaking fashion journalist and creative director André Leon Talley died at the age of 73. Talley was champion of diversity and industry change on and off the runway, while weathering plenty of racism and size-ism himself. The interview: In 2020, Talley spoke with Hadley Freeman at length about his upbringing, ascent in the industry and tangled relationship with Anna Wintour. You can read that interview here.

There’s just one problem, Stuart Heritage writes: ““If Belfast was set in any recognisable universe, then one of Dornan’s neighbours would have said, ‘Have you ever thought about becoming a model?’” Can I have another example? “The reigning queen of this is probably Kate Winslet,” Heritage writes. She has “made something of a cottage industry of pretending that she isn’t as beautiful as she obviously is”. And another? “Casting Samantha Barks as ragged, impoverished Éponine in Les Misérables was just silly. Look at that bone structure. Get out there and do some catalogue work, Éponine!

1/20/2022,"Ahead of this week’s Quad Series in London, the onus on a new-look Diamonds team, who had played just a handful of Tests together, was to at least show some fight; something to fuel optimism for the future. With victory over hosts England in the final, they succeeded in that aim – and then some. A clearly reinvigorated side, led by a rampaging Gretel Bueta – who missed just eight goals all tournament and was named player of the match and series – played with a tangible sense of freedom, fluidity and fearlessness across four matches, and won the nation’s first piece of silverware since October 2019.  It is not a bad return for a team whose credentials were under the microscope after winning just one game in last March’s Constellation Cup series in New Zealand. In the final against the Roses – the team who beat them in the 2018 Commonwealth Games final and drew with them in the third game of the series just 24 hours earlier – Stacey Marinkovich’s side won in emphatic style 58-46. They outscored the Roses by 13 goals in the last quarter at the Copper Box Arena, after being down at each break. It was a borderline embarrassing result for a Roses outfit that went into the series as clear favourites, having beaten New Zealand and Jamaica in recent series. Jess Thirlby’s team also had strong wins against the Silver Ferns and the Proteas earlier in the tournament, as did the Diamonds, who have never dropped their world No 1 ranking. The Roses simply could not shut down Bueta or match the Diamonds’ fearlessness in defence as the game wore on and looked second-rate as the Australians pulled away in the final stanza. More than just demonstrating fight, Australia’s win showed the potential for a sparkling future. It vindicated Marinkovich’s recent insistence that a quality training environment could overcome the fact she has had just eight Tests to prepare for the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham later this year. A pinnacle event in the sport, the Games in July and August come after a full Super Netball season ends in mid-June, meaning the Diamonds will have limited time to prepare. Before the Quad Series, Marinkovich said the Diamonds knew what they had to do to get results, regardless of the dearth of Test minutes because they had been drilling it in training. “I have great confidence that the program, and the way the girls are going about their time together, is really focusing on the way which we want to play.” That self-assurance now appears well placed. After the final, Marinkovich’s focus was again on confidence, as she talked about pulling back the lead from the Roses, who had looked in control in patches. “They needed to feel that they had the trust of the players around them, that they could let the ball go and [that] they had the back-up. They had to be courageous,” Marinkovich said. For 28-year-old Bueta, who shot 41/42 at 98% accuracy in the final, it was a triumphant return to international netball after the birth of her son in January last year. The 192cm Gold Coast native played back at goal shooter throughout the series, a position she has rarely played at any level. Her athleticism, smarts, split and unflappability made her impossible to mark. Coming to the game relatively late after playing high-level basketball as a junior, Bueta has always been a polarising figure in the game because of her unorthodox approach, but the 2022 Quad Series will go down as the tournament she truly arrived. While Marinkovich tried several shooting combinations through the tournament, she stuck with Bueta and 30-year-old Steph Wood, who came into the final as Australia’s third-most accurate shooter, having missed just six shots for an accuracy of 90% across a total of seven quarters. Wood finished with 17/18, despite looking shaky at times. Holding son Bobby in a post-match interview, the significance of the win was not lost on Bueta. “It was a really vital series for us in gaining momentum and working out connections leading up to Comm Games,” she said. “We know every quarter against England is a must-win, [they are an] exceptional side. I’m not too sure how we did that but I’m just really proud of the girls.” Liz Watson, who missed the last Super Netball season after foot surgery and was the sole captain for the first official time, led-all comers, finishing with 37 feeds and 19 centre pass receives; the most of anyone on-court. She also took one intercept. Watson was ably assisted by a near-perfect Paige Hadley in centre and Ash Brazill in wing defence, who did not recapture the blinding form she showed earlier in the tournament. Sarah Klau was key in keeper, finishing with one intercept, three gains and six deflections. Courtney Bruce and Jo Weston, both heavily penalised and involved in some big clashes, ground away at goal defence.",Sport/Sport,New-look Diamonds show fight in Quad Series and potential for sparkling future | Erin Delahunty,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/20/new-look-diamonds-show-fight-in-quad-series-and-potential-for-sparkling-future
1/20/2022,"“We just ran out of steam” said England head coach, Jess Thirlby, as Australia beat the Roses 58-46 in the Quad Series final, throwing away their chance at a first title. “It’s OK if it hurts,” she added. It was a match of 60 minutes but all it took for the Diamonds to break English hearts was the last 15. The fighting spirit that had pushed the Roses to a draw not 24 hours ago was worryingly absent in the final quarter as Australia shifted into fifth gear leaving England stuttering in second.  The two sides picked up exactly where they left off and when the Diamonds looked set to take early ownership of the contest, England intervened. Bodies collided as the sparring sides went toe-to-toe, and blow-for-blow with cautions handed out liberally. Scrapping relentlessly for turnover it was the Roses that looked stronger; Eleanor Cardwell and Layla Guscoth winning their respective matchups to hand England the advantage. When Sarah Klau entered the fray for Australia in the second quarter England’s attack turned to treacle. Holding firm, however, the Roses negotiated the oncoming pressure, frustrating the visitors in their refusal to fold. The score at half time had England leading Australia 27-25. There was a renewed sense of purpose about the Diamonds, in the second half, who executed the kind of netball that has shaped their formidable reputation: hard, accurate and remorseless. After losing the lead quickly in the final quarter England’s belief mutated to panic. At eight minutes to go, and four goals down, Thirlby rolled the dice but her substitutions did little against the swelling Australian tide. Errant passes and wayward shots from the Roses were the joy of player of the match, and player of the series, Gretel Bueta who punished the Roses shooting at 98%. Australia beamed as they blew the quarter out 18-5 sealing England’s fate and their sixth Quad series crown. “In terms of being at the top table with the best teams in the world, you’ve got to be able to take it the wins and losses on the chin,” said Thirlby whose attentions now turn to this summer’s Commonwealth Games defence which will feature an avenging Australian side. Optimistic there was much to learn Thirlby said: “Whilst it hurts now it won’t be doing us any harm at all.”",Sport/Sport,Australia beat England to win Quad Series as Roses ‘ran out of steam’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/19/england-australia-quad-series-final-match-report
1/20/2022,"Peru has demanded compensation from the Spanish oil giant Repsol after freak waves from a volcanic eruption near Tonga caused an oil spill described as the worst ecological disaster to hit the South American country in recent history. Peru’s prime minister, Mirtha Vásquez, told journalists on Wednesday that the Pampilla refinery, run by Repsol, “apparently” did not have a contingency plan for an oil spill.  The country’s foreign ministry called on the company to “immediately compensate” for the damage caused by the spill on Saturday which had inflicted “serious harm to hundreds of fishermen’s families” and had “put in danger the flora and fauna” in two protected natural areas. Authorities cordoned off three beaches on Monday after 6,000 barrels of oil were spilled during the offloading of a tanker at La Pampilla refinery off the coast near Lima, just north of the capital Lima. Images on social media and TV showed blackened beaches and dozens of dead seabirds drenched in oil, among them the rare Humboldt penguin, in an area considered a marine biodiversity hotspot. Officials at the refinery, managed by Repsol, initially described the spill as “limited” and said it was working with authorities to clean up the beaches. However, there has been public indignation at what has been perceived as the company’s tardy response. Tine Van Den Wall Bake, a spokesperson for Repsol, denied it should accept responsibility for the incident. “We did not cause this ecological disaster and we cannot say who is responsible,” she told national radio on Wednesday. Environmental groups have criticized the company’s response, as well as that of the Peruvian authorities. The oil was spreading along Peru’s Pacific coast affecting seabirds, seagulls, terns, sea lions, otters and dolphins, Oceana Peru said in a tweet. “The environmental and social impacts of the Repsol oil spill in the short and long term are devastating, and the company’s response has been weak,” said Christel Scheske, conservation specialist from the Peruvian Society for Environmental Law. “The oil spill has affected a highly biodiverse part of the Peruvian coast, including two protected areas which are important not only for Peru’s astounding marine biodiversity, but also for over 1,000 artisanal fishers in the region that depend on them,” she said. “Heavy metals from the crude oil will remain in the ecosystem for many years, rendering fish, molluscs and other marine species dangerous for human consumption, and affecting the entire marine food web,” Scheske added. The refinery could face a fine of up to $34.5 million, Peru’s environment ministry said on Monday as prosecutors opened an investigation into the company for environmental contamination. In a tweet, the attorney general’s office said the spill “is the worst ecological disaster in Lima in recent times, and has caused serious damage to hundreds of fishing families. Repsol must immediately compensate for this damage.” The energy and mining regulation body Osinergmin has ordered the suspension of operations at the refinery pending an investigation into the causes of the spill.",News/World news,Peru demands compensation for disastrous oil spill caused by Tonga volcano,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/peru-spain-repsol-disastrous-oil-spill
