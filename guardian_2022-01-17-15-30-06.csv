1/17/2022,"Good Monday morning to you, Graham Russell here with the latest news to start the week.  The prime minister has dealt a serious blow to the BBC’s funding in what critics say is a diversionary tactic to escape accountability for the “Partygate” revelations. With reports that dozens of Tory backbenchers have written letters of no-confidence, Boris Johnson ally Nadine Dorries said the BBC’s licence fee would be abolished in 2027 and the broadcaster’s funding frozen for the next two years, potentially leading to thousands of redundancies. Other measures under what has been called Operation Red Meat are said to involve a renewed drive to stop people crossing the Channel in small boats, measures to tackle the NHS operations backlog, extra investment in skills and the lifting of Covid restrictions on 26 January. Lucy Powell, the shadow culture secretary, said: “The prime minister thinks those reporting on his rule-breaking should pay consequences, whilst he gets off free”, while Ian Murray, the shadow Scottish secretary, described the announcement as “a last-ditch attempt [by Johnson] to save his failing premiership”. The timing of the announcements is highly convenient, writes Heather Stewart, and gives Tory rightwingers something to cheer as Johnson’s future hangs in the balance. ‘An act of terror’ – Two teenagers have been arrested in Manchester by counter-terror police over the Texas synagogue standoff in which the attacker was named as a British national. The pair are being questioned after suspect Malik Faisal Akram, a 44-year-old who had been a resident of Blackburn in Lancashire, took four people hostage at a synagogue in a Dallas suburb on Saturday. He was pronounced dead after the FBI stormed the building. All four hostages were unharmed after what Joe Biden described as “an act of terror”. ‘It’s excruciating’ – A British woman is feared to have been swept to her death in the tsunami sparked by the eruption at the weekend of an underwater volcano in Tonga. Angela Glover, who runs an animal shelter there, has not been seen since being hit by the wave, which also caught up her husband and the couple’s dogs. “One of the dogs has been found, but Angela hasn’t been found,” said brother Nick Eleini. “It’s excruciating. I can’t even believe the words are coming out of my mouth, to be honest.” Australia and New Zealand have sent planes to assess the damage from the eruption that has blanked the area with ash, contaminating water supplies and cutting off communications. Pandemic pressures – Eight million people in England are drinking so much wine, beer or spirits that it is harmful to their health, government data shows, with a large increase in the number drinking at dangerous levels. Before the pandemic, the figure stood at about 5 million. The switch to drinking at home was partly to blame, said Prof Julia Sinclair from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, with drinking sessions sometimes lasting several hours longer than they would in a pub. “Just even nine months of drinking, as we saw in 2020, was enough to push a whole load of people over the edge.” ‘I thought that was my ambition over’ – Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Conservative leader, has said she considered not running for the leadership amid fears her mental health records would be exposed. Davidson, who was diagnosed with clinical depression while at university, said her fears were prompted by the press accessing the medical records of Gordon Brown’s son, which “felt like a really egregious breach”. Davidson said she hoped being able to open up about mental health issues on her own terms would help others realise it is not career-ending, as she had once feared. Burns after reading – Robert Burns, the revered Scottish bard behind Auld Lang Syne, was advised not to write in Scots because no one in London would understand it, new research has shown. Dr John Moore, a Scottish physician and travel author who was a regular correspondent with the poet, “cautioned Burns that he was limiting his audience” and told him to avoid political subjects too. When Burns sent Moore a long letter detailing his entire childhood, Moore wrote back urging him to divide his letters up next time because he was “obliged to pay six & eightpence for it”. The correspondence will be published as part of a new collected works by the Oxford University Press.

Jonathan Wilson writes that perhaps the strangest aspect of Rafa Benítez’s time at Everton is how well it began, with 14 points after seven league games. But the problem was that Benítez is Benítez and a significant part of that identity is bound up with Liverpool. Turning to cricket, England have for some time been collapse specialists but even by their standards the Ashes Test in Hobart was a spectacular explosion of fortune, says Tanya Aldred. Joe Root appears keen to lead England into a new era regardless. In netball, England kept alive their hopes of a first Quad Series title after overcoming an eight-goal deficit to defeat New Zealand 49-46 and book their spot in Wednesday’s final. Scotland’s largest auction of permits to construct offshore windfarms is expected to raise up to £860m today when the results are announced.

The Guardian leads with Boris Johnson’s reported Operation Red Meat, with the headline: “PM accused of attacking BBC to save his own skin”. The i sees it more as “Operation dead meat” after speaking to senior Tories, and the Mirror looks at “Johnson’s scapegoats” with a report that other heads will roll in order to keep his job safe and that the prime minister was at another party in 2020. The Telegraph says Johnson has already been questioned by inquiry head Sue Gray over the “Partygate” scandal. Elsewhere, the Times reports on the other prong of Johnson’s distraction strategy, with his call for the military to help stop Channel boat crossings “as part of an attempt to save his premiership”. The Express talks of Johnson’s plan to win back popular support with the headline “PM: fightback plan to level up Britain” but makes no mention of the attack on BBC funding. The Mail focuses on the republication of a photo of Keir Starmer having a beer with colleagues last year at a constituency office at a time when household mixing was allowed only when working.

1/17/2022,"China’s birthrate has fallen to its lowest level in six decades, barely outnumbering deaths in 2021 despite major government efforts to increase population growth and stave off a demographic crisis. Across China, 10.62 million babies were born in 2021, a rate of 7.52 per thousand people, the national bureau of statistics said on Monday. In the same period 10.14 million deaths were recorded, a mortality rate of 7.18 per thousand, producing a population growth rate of just 0.34 per thousand head of population.  The rate of growth is the lowest since 1960, and adds to the findings of last May’s once-a-decade census, which found an average annual rise of 0.53%, down from 0.57% reported from 2000 to 2010. China, like much of east Asia, is in the grip of a population crisis, with lowering birthrates, and predictions of imminent negative population growth and an ageing population. Monday’s figures showed the proportion of over-60s in China rose from 18.7% in 2020 to 18.9%. “The demographic challenge is well known but the speed of population ageing is clearly faster than expected,” said Zhiwei Zhang, the chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. “This suggests China’s total population may have reached its peak in 2021. It also indicates China’s potential growth is likely slowing faster than expected.” Beijing has announced major reforms to address the decline, including raising the retirement age. A three-child policy has replaced the two-child policy that was introduced in 2016 and had sparked a slight increase in births before falling again. The high cost of living, delayed marriages and lack of social mobility are frequently cited as contributing factors to young Chinese people’s reluctance to have children. In response, Beijing has banned expensive private tutoring, and pledged better access to childcare and maternity leave. Prof Wang Feng, from the University of California Irvine and who specialises in Asian demographics, said the results showed the root causes ran deeper than the policymakers realised. “The policies announced last year are mostly rhetoric, or at most like Band-Aids,” he told the Guardian. “Without addressing the deeply rooted causes discouraging young Chinese from getting married and having children, from gender inequality to high living cost, what we are seeing now is likely just the beginning of a further decline in birthrate and a prolonged process of population decline in China.” China also faces potential instability on the economic front, with GDP data published alongside the population findings revealing a dramatic slowdown in the final months of 2021. China, the world’s second-largest economy, reported a higher-than-expected GDP rise of 8.1% year-on-year, beyond the government’s predictions of 6%, but with the growth concentrated in the first half of the year. In the fourth quarter it rose by 4%, down from 4.9% in the third quarter. “The domestic economy is under the triple pressures of demand contraction, supply shock and weakening expectations,” said bureau spokesman Ning Jizhe. The last year has seen extraordinary levels of change in consumer habits and of government intervention in major Chinese industries. Retail sales growth dropped from 3.9% in November to 1.7% in December. “Economic growth is clearly under pressure, (and) recent Omicron outbreaks in China exacerbated the downside risk,” said Zhang. Construction has slumped and property sales were battered amid a crisis in development, most notably the ongoing financial difficulties of major firm Evergrande. Government intervention into the $1bn private tutoring industry and continued crackdowns on the tech sector have also seen waves of layoffs. An emissions-reduction push coupled with supply chain issues and bans on some imported coal have been blamed, alongside rising power prices for power cuts.",News/World news,China’s birthrate falls to 61-year low despite moves to stave off demographic crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/17/chinas-birthrate-falls-to-61-year-low-despite-moves-to-stave-off-demographic-crisis
1/17/2022,"More than 1 million women in the UK could be forced out of their jobs this year because their employers are failing to support them as they go through the menopause, researchers have said. A survey of 2,000 women aged 45 to 67 across the UK experiencing menopause symptoms found that this lack of support is having a direct impact on their decisions to leave the workplace. The women said it was the second most devastating impact on their career to date, only just behind having children.  It found that a quarter of the women surveyed (24%) are unhappy in their jobs because of a lack of support, with 63% noting that their place of work has not introduced any kind of policy to make things easier for women going through menopause. Terri Eva’s symptoms are so bad that she has been on sick leave from her job in a children’s centre for the last six months. “My symptoms mean that being at work, without any support, is like torture,” she said. “My joints are so painful that I can’t move without agony. My head is in such a muddle that I can’t keep two thoughts in it at the same time and the anxiety is so bad it wakes me up at night.” Eva will have to return to work shortly to avoid her pay being halved. “I’ve always loved my work but the thought of having to go back is terrifying,” she said. I also pay the mortgage on our home and can’t see how my family will survive if my salary is cut,” she said. “But I’m terrified of going back. My managers are sympathetic but don’t offer any real support.” Gillian Archibald has left three jobs over the last seven years as she struggled to find employers who can help her cope with her symptoms in the workplace. “I don’t think employers have any idea how debilitating and soul-destroying it is for women who have worked their entire lives and want to continue working to feel a shadow of their former selves, but to not receive any meaningful support to keep working,” she said. The House of Commons women and equalities committee will hear evidence on Wednesday afternoon on how the law protects women in the workplace who are experiencing menopause symptoms. The evidence session, which will be the third of the committee’s inquiry into menopause and the workplace, will explore the relevant and applicable law and question whether it is fit for purpose. MPs will also examine the case for reforming existing legislation or introducing new laws. In total, one in four of those questioned by Research Without Barriers said a lack of support from their workplaces had left them deeply unhappy in their jobs. “Women should never be pushed out of the workplace because of their biology. Menopause is a natural part of women’s life course, and shouldn’t mean the end of their career,” said Rachel Carrell, the founder of Koru Kids, which commissioned the research. “As a society, we need to support older women with flexible working and health support so they don’t fall out of the workplace needlessly.” Nearly three-quarters of women who took part in the research said their workplace did not have a forum or space where they could talk openly about the menopause with their colleagues or employers, exacerbating their feelings of isolation and distress. Diane Danzebrink, the founder of Menopause Support, said the research was “shocking but sadly not surprising”. “Women supported through menopause will remain in the workplace and achieve their full potential and employers will retain valuable members of their teams,” she said. “It’s a win-win situation for employers and employees, it’s as simple as that.”",News/Society,More than 1m UK women could quit their jobs through lack of menopause support,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/17/more-than-1m-uk-women-could-quit-their-jobs-through-lack-of-menopause-support
1/17/2022,"Scotland’s beloved son and national bard Robert Burns has done more than any other poet to export the 18th-century Scottish dialect around the world, through the new year classic Auld Lang Syne and his other famous works. His lyrics, such as “we twa hae run about the braes/and pou’d the gowans fine”, may be incomprehensible to many, but the fame and influence of a man annually celebrated on 25 January has endured over more than two centuries.  His line from To a Mouse, “the best laid schemes o’ Mice an’ Men/ Gang aft-agley”, is said to have inspired John Steinbeck’s 1937 classic novella Of Mice and Men. Yet Burns was advised not to write in Scots by one correspondent, who believed it would limit his audience, according to new research. Dr John Moore, a Scottish physician and travel author, who wrote regularly to Burns, warned him that London readers would not connect to his works. Burns, obviously, ignored the advice, and the rest is history. Academics at the University of Glasgow’s Centre for Robert Burns Studies looked at about 800 letters written by Burns and 300 to 400 letters from his friends and admirers “In the correspondence, we get closer to Burns the man than anywhere else: his letters reveal his triumphs, failures, anxieties, fears and joys,” said Dr Rhona Brown, a senior lecturer in Scottish literature at the centre “Two of Burns’s relationships stand out – with Dr John Moore and Mrs Frances Dunlop [a Scottish heiress and landowner] – as we have both sides of the correspondence. “What is fascinating, for example, is that early on Moore advised Burns not to write in Scots. He cautioned Burns that he was limiting his audience and felt that London readers wouldn’t understand or connect with the Scots language. Dunlop advised him to avoid political subjects. “But Burns is his own man and ignores the advice and carries on regardless. I think history has now shown that he was right.” People around the globe will celebrate Burns Night on 25 January to celebrate the anniversary of the poet’s birth on that date in 1759. The correspondence will be published as part of the new Collected Works of Robert Burns published by the Oxford University Press. Dr Craig Lamont, a research associate in Robert Burns Studies at the University of Glasgow, said: “Burns sends Dr John Moore a long, heartfelt letter giving a detailed account of his childhood and life up to 1787: this letter is now known as Burns’s autobiographical letter. “In response, Moore asks Burns to ‘divide your letters when they are so heavy’, because ‘I was obliged to pay six & eightpence for it.’” The team will premiere their video documentary on the Editing Robert Burns for the 21st Century: Correspondence project at 10am on 17 January. The centre will also host an online question and answer session on 20 January so that members of the public and Burns scholars can find out more about the project, with more information available via GlasgowBurns.",Arts/Books,Robert Burns letters reveal poet was advised not to write in Scots dialect,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/17/robert-burns-letters-reveal-poet-was-advised-not-to-write-in-scots-dialect
1/17/2022,"Tina Leverton was 62 when she bought her first pair of ballet shoes. She says slipping her feet into the soft leather was very emotional. “I felt utterly transported. I took a photo of them and sent it to my daughter. I said: ‘I’ve waited a long time for these.’” A few weeks earlier, Leverton had taken the first ballet class of her life, after an advert in a freesheet caught her eye. It showed older women at the barre. “It really evoked a strong memory from when I was a child. I thought: ‘Let’s go for it.’” The class was near Leverton’s home in Mumbles, on the Gower peninsula in south Wales. “As I came in the door, I twirled around,” she says. “Big smile on my face. From the minute I started, it was wonderful. It felt like coming home.”  Leverton had longed to dance as a child. From the age of four, she repeatedly drew pointe shoes, although she has no idea where she saw them or how she learned their “beautiful shape”. If an adult asked what she wanted to be, she always answered: “Ballet dancer.” When she was nine or so, she accompanied a friend to classes. The friend danced. Leverton watched, “all the time imagining I was dancing with her”. Leverton’s parents were first-generation immigrants, born in India before partition. Her father was a train driver on the underground in London; her mother held two cleaning jobs and worked in a cafe near the family home in the north of the city. “We were poorer than other people, but it never bothered me,” Leverton says – not even when her parents told her they couldn’t afford ballet. “They were so busy trying to survive.” Nonetheless, she harboured dreams of being a ballerina. “But they were just that: dreams.” Although her parents felt shame – at the shortage of money, at being immigrants – it didn’t pass on to her. “I guess I’ve just got a really lucky disposition. I’m generally quite contented. My mother used to say: ‘If anyone asks, tell them you’re Spanish or Portuguese.’ It’s only when I met my current husband, who’s a psychotherapist, that we explored that together. It was very emancipating to say to people: ‘Actually, I’m from Pakistani heritage.’” Leverton went to art school, then veered towards customer service. Eventually, she stopped drawing. Then, when her daughter was three, Leverton took her to ballet. “She loved it. And I loved it. I was living vicariously through her.” She sees now that her love of ballet “has been lying dormant. It’s come to the forefront at just the right age for me.” Had she known as a child that dancers with low arches and “poor turn-out from the hip” rarely excel, she “would have been crushed”. Instead, she has watched herself grow. At first, a grand plié – lowering to the floor with bent knees – was out of the question. “I’d bend down and couldn’t get up again,” Leverton says, laughing. It has taken three months to master the pirouette, while leaping and landing on one foot presented “a psychological barrier”. Being overweight, Leverton feared her ankles wouldn’t take it. “But they can,” she says. “I love the struggle, the challenge, learning something new. When I get it, I feel absolutely elated,” she says. “People in their 60s have a lot of self-limiting beliefs: ‘I can’t do it,’ ‘I’m not good enough.’ And maybe they’re not good enough. But it doesn’t matter,” she says. Ballet has been transformative. At a medical appointment a few months after Leverton’s first class, a nurse measured her at 163cm (5ft 4in) – half an inch taller than she had thought. She made the nurse double-check. She attributes the discrepancy to improved posture. Her muscle tone has improved, too, and her lower back pain has eased. Dancing has brought new friends, a “sisterhood of older, more independent women”, working towards a team award with the Royal Academy of Dance. And then, of course, there is “the feeling, the joyfulness. Ballet is all the therapy I’ll ever need.” Leverton now plans to buy some pointe shoes: “I will get some – and I’ll draw them.”  Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?",Lifestyle/Life and style,A new start after 60: ‘I took up ballet at 62 – and it felt like coming home’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/17/a-new-start-after-60-i-took-up-ballet-at-62-and-it-felt-like-coming-home
1/17/2022,"Where do you start with a story that involves counter-terrorism police doing background checks on a tiger, has its roots in the mental health problems of Nazi soldiers, and features an investigation into whether a beehive hairdo can be used as a weapon? What’s more, weaving in and out of all of this, there are two German magicians in mullets and shiny suits seemingly capable of floating around in the air, one of whom nearly dies on stage after a white tiger bites clean through his neck. This was the problem facing Emmy-winning film-maker Steven Leckart, who had long felt that the extraordinary story of Siegfried and Roy, whose performances with exotic animals electrified Las Vegas, deserved a proper telling. The result is Wild Things, an eight-part podcast detailing how Siegfried Fischbacher and Roy Horn rose to international stardom with a whole zoo’s worth of performing jungle cats, then had their live career effectively ended when a tiger called Montecore attacked Roy on stage, nearly killing him.  “As a child of the 80s,” says Leckart, speaking via Zoom from his Los Angeles home, “Siegfried and Roy have always loomed large for me. And no one has ever properly examined their story – or the attack – in depth.” To do so was a mighty undertaking: over the course of 50 years, Siegfried and Roy performed 30,000 shows to 50 million people, generating over $1bn in ticket sales. Their act fused gigantic, mind-boggling illusions with the most exotic animals on earth, sparking an explosion in families coming to Vegas shows, at a time when bills were dominated by topless showgirls. The duo suspended tigers above crowds on flaming disco balls and made elephants vanish into thin air. After their shows, they would hang out with their jungle cats in their suite at the Mirage hotel, before returning to their $10m Moroccan-style villa the Jungle Palace, or their 100-acre residence Little Bavaria, where German marching music played through concealed speakers. Their celebrity acquaintances included Michael Jackson (who wrote them a theme song), David Lee Roth (who gifted them goats) and Pope John Paul II (who gave them a fragment of Saint Francis of Assisi’s shinbone). In 1998, the then US President Bill Clinton joined them after a show, his secret service sharpshooters training their weapons on the tigers. A Saturday Night Live spoof had them introducing a special Night of a Thousand Tigers. “They were hyperbole manifested,” says Leckart. “Everything about them was bigger, was louder, was dialled up to 11, which is a deliberate Spinal Tap reference. But what kept them going for so many years was their incredible skill and the way they progressed their show.” Wild Things takes listeners through this journey, which has surprisingly sad origins in Germany. Both Siegfried and Roy’s fathers were violent, rage-filled alcoholics, scarred by years of fighting as Nazi soldiers. Roy’s lifelong love of animals started when he adopted a stray dog that protected him and his mother from his father’s fists. Siegfried sought refuge in magic, teaching himself tricks from books after watching an entertainer swallow razor blades in a town square. The budding illusionists met as teenagers on a German cruise ship, where Roy worked as a bellboy after fleeing his family and Siegfried was a steward with a magic show in the evening. Unimpressed by the spectacle of rabbits being disappeared from hats, Roy decided to scale things up and get him a cheetah instead, so smuggled one out of a zoo. It marked the start of their signature fusion of magic and jungle cats. Legend has it that a furious captain kicked them off the ship, but Leckart tells a different story: “I heard that the captain was really mad about it, but the crowd loved it so much that he let them carry on.” In 1966, the duo’s big break came when Grace Kelly (AKA Princess Grace of Monaco) invited them to perform at her annual Red Cross gala in Monte Carlo. Their cheetah, Chico, fled through a celebrity-packed crowd, straight past Kelly and into the kitchens. When Siegfried nonchalantly jumped off the stage, the crowd assumed it was all part of the act. A standing ovation and newspaper headlines followed. Within a few years, they were regular performers in Vegas, before bagging a headline slot with the city’s first full-length magic show. Eventually, a rival hotel would poach them in a flamboyant stunt in which they were helicoptered in to sign a $57m contract. Their new venue had 1,500 seats and it sold out, twice a night, for a decade. Listening to Wild Things – its first two episodes have just dropped – you do wonder: “Isn’t some of this cruel to animals?” We hear lively stories about the magicians removing baby tigers from their mother. A supposedly humorous anecdote involves a panther bursting a waterbed after it’s locked in a bedroom during a party, while a pacy anecdote about two tigers being stolen does rather skip over the fact that they had been left outside a deli locked in the back of a truck. This can’t all be OK, can it? “We do go – in depth – into the question of animal welfare and safety in a subsequent episode,” says Leckart. “What we uncover is not just shocking, but really disturbing.” Initially, though, Wild Things concerns itself with the 2003 tiger attack. By the time it happened, Siegfried and Roy had been performing alongside exotic animals for 44 years, repeating the same show every night for an entire decade. It was so routine that – as the cast left Roy on stage to deliver a spotlit monologue to seven-year-old white tiger Montecore – they knew every word and gesture that was coming. Or so they thought. Montecore bites Roy through the neck, slicing his vertebrae and severing an artery that cuts off the blood to the right side of his brain. He drags Roy about, coating the stage in so much blood that one onlooker says: “I’m thinking to myself, ‘He’s gone. He’s not going to make it, man.’ This was fucking hell on earth.” Another shocked voice says: “It took four men and a fire extinguisher to get the tiger off him.” In the ambulance, Roy manages to gasp: “Montecore is a great cat. Make sure no harm comes to Montecore.” Soon he is flatlining in hospital and the Mirage car park is filling up with praying, weeping fans. Police enter the hotel to find drinks abandoned on tables and a stage still slicked with blood. So intense is the media spotlight that the police decide to use officers normally assigned to counter-terrorist cases. The question is: was the tiger attack a crime? And this is where the podcast, which had been compelling enough, really shifts into another gear. It would be unfair to give away its many surprises but (spoiler alert) Leckart’s team discover that the investigation entered truly bizarre territory, including animal activists, homophobes in the crowd, ultrasonic devices and a woman near the stage with a large beehive hairdo. Montecore’s background is probed, too. “This is why we called the podcast Wild Things,” says Leckart. “We would just find new and wild bits of information at every turn. What’s even more bizarre is the separate investigation into animal cruelty by the USDA. The twists and turns of where that goes is bananas.” Roy was left partially paralysed on the left side of his body. He claimed that Montecore didn’t actually attack him, insisting that he had suffered a stroke and the tiger was trying to take him to safety. He continued to live with Montecore until the jungle cat’s death in 2014. To this day, there has been no widely accepted explanation of the incident, which led to the Mirage closing the show. Leckart, however, thinks he’s succeeded where the counter-terrorism detectives failed. “We absolutely solve the question of what happened with the attack,” he says. “We come to a very clear conclusion. My view on the cause changed throughout the making of the series. But you will not leave the podcast without forming an opinion on what happened.” Roy died of Covid in May 2020 at the age of 75. Siegfried succumbed to pancreatic cancer the following January. He was 81. Both had retired from showbusiness a decade earlier. Siegfried and Roy were the highest paid magicians Vegas had ever had and a statue to them now stands outside the Mirage. They pulled off extraordinary stunts night after night, but their greatest illusion was ultimately, and tragically, exposed: the idea that these beautiful, exotic creatures could be tamed. “A wild animal is always a wild animal,” we hear Roy say early on. “Don’t ever forget that.”",Arts/Television & radio,‘It took four men and a fire extinguisher to get the tiger off him’: the tragedy of Vegas magicians Siegfried and Roy,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/17/vegas-siegfried-roy-tiger-wild-things-mystery-exotic-animal-sin-city-counter-terrorism
1/17/2022,"This week, the full moon will cruise through three zodiacal constellations. First Gemini, the twins; then Cancer, the crab; and finally Leo, the lion.  The chart shows the view at 2100 GMT on 17 January, looking east-south-east from London. The moon will be full and sitting just below the two brightest stars of Gemini: Castor and Pollux. The brighter of the two, and the star nearest to the moon, is the yellow-tinged Pollux, while the one above is the whiter but dimmer Castor. A day later, the moon will be smack in the middle of Cancer. Although with 99% of the moon’s visible surface still illuminated, it could be difficult to see the faint stars of the constellation. But the moon does make a straight line with two other bright stars. These are Procyon in Canis Minor, the lesser dog, and Sirius in Canis Major, the great dog. By Wednesday, the moon will be in Leo, poised between the orange-tinged glow of Algieba, and the brighter white light of Regulus. The view can also be seen from the southern hemisphere. From Sydney in Australia, it is best seen later in the evening, around midnight.",News/Science,Starwatch: full moon to pass through three constellations,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/17/starwatch-full-moon-pass-through-three-constellations
1/17/2022,"Millions of Britons are causing themselves “silent harm” through hazardous drinking at home, experts have warned, as figures reveal levels of “higher risk” alcohol consumption have soared during the pandemic. While the new figures concern England only, the phenomenon has been seen in all parts of the UK.  Eight million people in England are drinking so much wine, beer or spirits that it is harmful to their health, according to data from the government’s Office for Health Improvement and Disparities, with a large increase in the numbers drinking at levels considered to be dangerous. Prof Julia Sinclair, the chair of the addictions faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the switch to drinking at home during the Covid pandemic was partly to blame for the rise, with drinking sessions sometimes lasting several hours longer than they would in a pub. Figures based on YouGov surveys show 18.1% of adults in England were drinking at “increasing or higher risk” in the three months to the end of October 2021, which equates to 8 million people. That is much higher than in February 2020, before the pandemic, when 12.4% or about 6 million people drank at these levels. In October 2019, 11.9%, or about 5 million people, were drinking at this level. The NHS recommends adults consume no more than 14 units of alcohol per week. Increasing or higher-risk drinking is defined by the alcohol use disorders identification test (audit) used by professionals, which asks questions about people’s drinking habits. It looks at how often people drink, how many units in one session, whether they ever feel guilty and whether they sometimes miss out on usual activities due to drinking. Sinclair said the latest data, which suggests more than twice as many men as women are drinking alcohol at hazardous levels, showed people were still dealing with uncertainty and anxiety caused by the pandemic while some had formed habits involving alcohol. Asked if current drinking levels could be considered the “new normal”, Sinclair told PA Media: “The best, most realistic, scenario is that the higher-risk drinkers go back over the next probably five years to normal risk drinking – back to where they were. But people won’t just suddenly flip back to where they were – none of us suddenly flips back. “What we’re going to see is that some people who were perhaps drinking at a higher risk but weren’t physically dependent will have pushed themselves into being physically dependent, and they’re not the group who can suddenly wind back from this. “What was really clear was that just even nine months of drinking, as we saw in 2020, was enough to push a whole load of people over the edge. We’ve yet to see the data from this year but my guess anecdotally would be that it is going to be substantial.” Sinclair said some people who never drank except when they went out or went to the pub were now drinking at home. “You then get some periodic times when you can also drink in the pub,” she said. “Do you suddenly change your behaviour to not drinking at home or does drinking in the pub now become the add-on?” At the moment, Sinclair said, the data suggests people were carrying on drinking what they began to drink at home and then drinking more on top of that. Many people have not yet reached the stage where they realise they have a problem and are causing themselves “silent harm”, she added. Drinking at home “can go on for hours” and people are not keeping track of their measures – “the drinks are not coming in units”, she said. Sinclair said patients were coming into hospitals in a “much more severe” state. “We’ve had more patients going into delirium tremens – the really kind of life-threatening part of alcohol withdrawal – who end up in intensive care,” she said. “I have seen more people in our hospital in that state [during the pandemic] than I’ve seen in the six years prior to that.”",News/Society,"Millions in UK drinking harmful levels of alcohol at home, experts warn",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/17/millions-in-uk-drinking-harmful-levels-of-alcohol-at-home-experts-warn
1/17/2022,"It is a terrible day to be walking on the fells of the Lake District, but here we are, staggering along the Cat Bells ridge under a violent, cacophonous wind. A little punchdrunk, we retire into the Newlands Valley, where we go in search of more sheltered rewards. After a bit of educated guessing, we find what we’re looking for in the side of the great prow of Scope End: a narrow, misleadingly inconspicuous nook in the hillside.  The Goldscope mine is the handiwork of German miners who were brought over to Cumbria in the 16th century at the behest of Elizabeth I, who needed extra copper to fund a looming war with Spain. Their efforts paid off; the vein at Scope End was so rich they renamed it “Gottsgabt” – or God’s Gift – which eventually became anglicised to Goldscope. We don headtorches and venture inside, stooping as we go. It is cramped, as you might expect from a tunnel system painstakingly chipped out from the hard Ordovician rock, 300 years before the invention of dynamite. In places I can feel a claustrophobic anxiety rising, but I manage to keep it down. If we had carried on, we would eventually have emerged back into daylight – remarkably, the two ends of this passageway, which were started on opposite sides of the mountain, meet almost perfectly in the middle. After 150 metres or so we reach a shaft, strung with timbers, which leads to other levels of the mine. I feel a hit of both claustrophobia and vertigo at the same time. I shiver at the thought of the peril, the pain, the darkness and exhaustion which working in this grim industrial hole must have involved, however skilled or well-paid the work might have been, and feel grateful for being born when I was. Not being speleological experts, we decide we’ve seen enough at this point, and return to the grey, gusty outside. But we have had a fascinating glimpse into the Lake District’s underworld, and a reminder of this Romantic landscape’s hard-bitten, unromantic past.
