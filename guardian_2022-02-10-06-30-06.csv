2/10/2022,"This isn’t what RuPaul had in mind at all. Before the drag race begins, two tractors, one containing a farmer called Bucky and his non-ironic mullet, the other helmed by the current Miss Northamptonshire, roar on the rustic grid. Now British agriculture is unsupported by EU subsidies, while fruit withers unpicked on the proverbial vine and dairy farming recovers from Veganuary, this show demonstrates how to repurpose a beleaguered sector. In truth, tractors do not go fast, as anyone knows who has spent half an hour behind one on a Devon lane with their bladder clamouring for attention. And yet this is the premise for The Fast and the Farmer-ish (BBC Three), a competitive tractor-racing show whose daft title suggests the unsought spiritual union of Vin Diesel and the Wurzels. Only Hugh Bonneville’s bonehead W1A lackeys would see fit to commission such obvious nonsense.  Welcome to the antidote to University Challenge. Watching it, I feel the same rustic stupefaction Jarvis Cocker described on the Pulp song Sorted for E’s & Wizz: “Mother … I seem to have left an important part of my brain in a field in Hampshire.” The Fast and the Farmer-ish is a post-industrial mash-up of It’s a Knockout and Total Wipeout. It is Robot Wars with barely more sentience or Top Gear with, at least in this episode, as much oestrogen as testosterone. It is lads against lasses, explains overexcited host Tom Pemberton, a farmer-turned-TV-presenter who is here given his first opportunity to shout commentary at farm vehicles on national television. The men’s team is called Check Shirt Choppers and, while I don’t want to labour the hairdo issue, two thirds of the team are made up of unacceptable mullet wearers. Two of the three rival Diva Drivers team are called Ellie. “We’re going to bring all of our feist,” explains one of the Ellies. That’s right. Feist is a word. Deal with it. Incredibly, the Mullets’ trash talk is worse: “She’s got a rubbish tractor and it’s pink,” says one. “No way I can be beaten.” What better way to finally decide whether men are better than women than a tractor race across a field divided by a bog, the tractors sprayed by water cannon, the country air filled with toxic diesel fumes and lame heteronormative bants? Literally anything. But let’s park the needle of our cynicism in the haystack of our scorn. The Fast and the Farmer-ish is what British sports fans need right now. Think of it this way: Britain’s Lewis Hamilton was bested by a flying Dutchman. British interest in the recent tennis ended before on-court barley water dispensers were filled. Anyone, even a team of limbless knights from Monty Python and the Holy Grail, could beat England at cricket. Now is the time for Britain to play to its strengths. We’ve never been any good at playing sports, but quite handy at inventing them. A TV tractor drag race is just the latest instance of native creative acumen, one that will, when franchised internationally, produce enough export earnings to plug Nadine Dorries’ anti-BBC cry hole. True, in the fullness of time, British tractor teams will be thrashed by teams from countries that don’t even have tractors right now. But today, happily, it is a domestic affair, Mullets against Divas for the right to stand in pomp atop the hay bale podium. In the second round, called The X Tractor, the teams drive up and down a large X shape cut into a field that is booby-trapped with tyres, toy pig mobiles and other obstacles, while, for bonus points, singing songs of their own choosing. Bucky, heroically, interprets Shania Twain. “I feel like a woman!” he sings as he reverses. The decisive final round is British farming’s belated homage to The Big Lebowski. Each contestant must drive their tractor at speed, brake sharply and release a rolling wheel of rubber towards sheds arranged like skittles in a bowling lane. The Fast and the Farmer-ish shows the British countryside is not the bucolic idyll evoked by Chris Packham and Michaela Strachan, but seethes with toxic fumes, sublimated rage, burning rubber, sexual tension and yokels in bad hair bawling supportively from the sidelines to their demented coevals.

2/10/2022,"Six Honduran environmentalists have been found guilty of crimes against a mining company, in a case widely condemned by legal and human rights experts. The activists, from the small community of Guapinol, have been held in pre-trial detention for two and a half years after opposing an iron oxide mine which has polluted rivers relied upon by thousands of people.  The massive open-pit mine, which is owned by one of the country’s most powerful couples, sits inside a protected national park in Tocoa, a municipality in the country’s northern Colón department. It was sanctioned without community consultation in a process mired by irregularities, according to international experts. On Wednesday, in a two-to-one divided decision, the court ruled that José Márquez, Kelvin Romero Martínez, José Abelino Cedillo, Porfirio Sorto Cedillo, Orbín Nahúm Hernández, and Ewer Alexander Cedillo Cruz were guilty of criminal damage and illegal detention of the company’s security chief. Two men, Arnold Alemán and Jeremias Martínez, were absolved of the same charges. Amnesty International, which considers the Guapinol environmentalists to be prisoners of conscience, described the verdict as “outrageous”. “The defenders are victims of arbitrary detention and unfounded criminal prosecution, stemming solely from their legitimate work defending the right to water and a healthy environment in Honduras,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. “It’s extremely serious that, despite the lack of diligence in the investigations by the public prosecutor’s office, six of the Guapinol prisoners of conscience are facing prison sentences.” Mary Lawlor, the UN special rapporteur on human rights defenders, said she was “appalled”, especially given Honduras last month took its seat the UN human rights council. “Honduras has yet again stained its record by not adhering to agreed international obligations. The conviction of the 6 Guapinol defenders should be quashed,” she said. The defence intends to seek an amnesty for the convicted men, through a controversial law just passed by the new president. Defence lawyer Edy Tabora said: “All eight men are innocent. The prosecutors failed to provide any evidence of a crime, never mind their participation in any activity that could be considered a crime. This is a political verdict that demonstrates the power of economic elites in this country.” Honduras became one of the most dangerous countries in the world to defend natural resources and land rights after the 2009 coup ushered in an autocratic pro-business government, which remained in power until last month. Since then, hundreds of defenders have been killed, harassed and jailed on trumped-up criminal charges. The highest-profile victim was the indigenous defender Berta Cáceres, who was assassinated in March 2016 after suffering years of threats and harassment linked to her opposition to an internationally funded dam. The Guapinol case dates back to 2011, when the Botaderos mountain was declared a national park by Congress, mandating protection of water sources which serve more than 42,000 people, including the Guapinol river. Yet the following year, Congress reduced the park’s no-development zone to accommodate the mine, owned by Lenir Pérez, a businessman previously accused of human rights violations, and Ana Facussé, daughter of the late palm oil magnate Miguel Facussé, a major political powerbroker who before his death in 2015 was accused of land grabs, violent repression and links with drug traffickers. Over the next few years, mining permits were issued and road construction began – even as communities filed legal complaints, held protests and pleaded with officials to protect the rivers. The tap water in Guapinol turned chocolate brown and thick with muddy sediment; children began suffering from diarrhoea, while some adults reported skin complaints. On 7 September 2018, one young protester was shot and seriously injured when scores of armed security guards working for the mine attempted to evict the protest camp. The incident was never investigated, but judicial authorities issued arrest warrants for some of the protesters. Wednesday’s ruling comes after a trial beset by delays and irregularities, in which international observers including the US National Lawyers Guild criticised the flimsy evidence presented by the prosecution, as well as judicial bias in favor of the mining company. The company Inversiones Los Pinares did not immediately respond for comment on the verdict. Gabriela Soto, whose father is among the six men convicted, said that the community would continue to defend the rivers. “We are going to continue stronger, and resist harder in this struggle.” The sentencing hearing is scheduled for 23 February. The men face prisoner terms of eight to 14 years.",News/World news,UN rapporteur ‘appalled’ by convictions for Hondurans who opposed open-pit mine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/honduras-environmentalists-guilty-crimes-mining-company

2/10/2022,"The number of people in England waiting for planned hospital care could hit 10.7 million by March 2024, leaked projections prepared for ministers and NHS bosses show. Even under the best-case scenario, the waiting list could reach 9.2 million, according to modelling about potential growth in the size of the NHS backlog seen by the Spectator magazine.  The figures emerged a day after the health secretary, Sajid Javid, told MPs that the backlog – already at a record 6 million – would keep on growing for another two years. His admission, while launching the “elective recovery plan” intended to tackle the backlog, has led to disquiet among Conservative MPs. They fear that the waiting list will keep growing in the run-up to the next general election in May 2024, threatening to damage the party’s efforts to rebrand itself as a strong supporter of the health service. There is also considerable unease in Tory ranks due to a suspicion that the rise in national insurance from 1 April, which several cabinet ministers believe is unwise given the cost of living crisis, will make little difference to that upward trend. The Spectator reported on Wednesday that, according to NHS England modelling, “the optimistic scenario shows that, [in] March 2024, the waiting list would stand at 9.2 million, falling to 8.5 million by March 2025. “The downside scenario shows the list peaking at 10.7 million and easing to just 10.3 million the following year.” Sources with knowledge of the figures said they were accurate. They emerged the day before NHS England publishes its latest monthly performance figures covering waits for operations, cancer treatment, A&E care and access to diagnostic tests such as scans and X-rays. However, while the Spectator said the projections had been drawn up by NHS England last week, NHS sources insisted that they had come from the Department of Health and Social Care. Javid himself has previously said that the waiting list could reach as many as 13 million if no remedial action was taken to ensure faster treatment. He told the Commons on Tuesday that about 10 million people did not seek NHS help during the pandemic, and that an unknown number of them, potentially as many as 80%, would probably do so over the next two years. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have called for the 1.25% rise in national insurance to be scrapped and for the £12bn a year the increase is expected to raise for the NHS and social care to be found elsewhere. The Daily Mail is running a vociferous campaign against what will be the biggest tax increase for many years. But Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, have insisted that it is going ahead. The ballooning of the waiting list – which stood at 4.4 million when the Covid pandemic struck in March 2020 – and the likelihood of its continued rapid growth is causing great concern in Downing Street. Under the elective recovery plan, NHS England has committed to ensuring that by this July no patient has to wait longer than two years for planned care, and that no one will have their care delayed by more than a year by March 2025. However, in a letter to local NHS leaders on Tuesday about the new plan, two senior health service figures, David Sloman and Sir James Mackey, said that those dates were merely “ambitions” rather than binding targets. NHS leaders and Javid agree that the uncertainty over how many people will seek care in the coming years makes it impossible to predict how big the headline waiting-list figure will become or by when. Under the NHS’s longstanding referral to treatment programme, 92% of patients who need an operation should be treated within 18 weeks. But that target – supposedly a right patients enjoy – has not been met since 2015, which staff groups blame on underfunding and staff shortages. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said: “Working families are being made to swallow another Tory tax rise. Yet it is clear from the government’s plan that patients will still be waiting longer for care.”",News/Society,"England’s hospital waiting lists may exceed 10 million by 2024, ministers told",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/09/englands-hospital-waiting-lists-may-exceed-10-million-by-2024-ministers-told
2/10/2022,"A rafter of rowdy turkeys have run afoul of researchers at Nasa’s Ames Center in Mountain View, California. Nearly two dozen birds have been creating chaos at the Bay Area space agency outpost, pecking at cars, blocking traffic, disrupting flights at the nearby Moffett federal airfield, and blanketing most everything with their droppings. They have become such a nuisance that officials from the US Department of Agriculture have been called in to trap and relocate them – before they begin nesting and hatch a new generation of pillaging poults.  The plan is to slowly lure the turkeys into a trap and drive them to the nearby San Antonio Valley ecological reserve. Wildlife officials will use corn or a similarly tempting turkey snack to coax the birds into one area. Once they begin to congregate in that area for a few days in a row, the officials will set up a walk-in corral trap, again tempting the birds with food. The corralled turkeys will have their blood drawn, get oral and cloacal swabs, get banded and then be placed in “turkey boxes”, said Tanya Espinosa, a spokesperson for the USDA. Cares will be taken to “reduce any stress” throughout the process, she said. “We hope to have most of them trapped within the next week or two,” added Espinosa. “Unfortunately, people continue to feed them which interferes with our trapping and relocation.” Feeding wild turkeys “makes them associate humans with food and often become more aggressive towards humans in their search for a meal,” she said. The federal space agency said the birds were being moved so they could “roam freely”. “This measure protects the safety and wellbeing of the turkeys, as well as the Ames community and workforce,” Nasa said in a statement. The Ames research center has long been home to a rafter of turkeys. One former employee described them to local news station KPIX as “very charming” and another said they were “friendly and nonchalant”. But the group’s ranks have grown larger, and their behavior more audacious in recent years, according to wildlife officials. #HappyThanksgiving These turkeys weren't on TV today, but they parade around @NASAAmes all the time.

Discover more things you probably didn't know about NASA in Silicon Valley: https://t.co/lzFPMZlStF pic.twitter.com/qS74eIsE4w “The turkeys are being relocated now, before they begin nesting to prevent the population from growing larger but still allow the turkeys to nest at the correct time,” Espinosa said. “This will help ensure that the young turkeys don’t learn from older turkeys in regards to damaging cars and landscaping.” Wild turkeys are common sightings in US cities, suburbs and parks. Their populations have resurged due to conservation efforts after decades of overhunting – especially in the years after Abraham Lincoln declared Thanksgiving an official holiday – diminished their numbers. “The turkeys came back, which was amazing from an ecological point of view,” Chris Bernier, a biologist for the Vermont fish and wildlife department, told the Guardian last year. “Unfortunately we live in their territories now.” The USDA and other wildlife agencies recommend that people who encounter aggressive turkeys near their homes defend themselves “with a broom, open umbrella, cane or spray them with a water hose”, but above all avoid interacting with or feeding the wild birds.",News/Environment,Rowdy rafter of turkeys wreak havoc at Nasa’s Silicon Valley campus,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/09/turkeys-nasa-ames-california-relocate
