1/9/2022,"Since its launch in 1994 with the enticing slogan “It could be you” and glitzy televised live draws, the national lottery has created 6,300 millionaires and given £43bn to good causes. But MPs and campaigners are calling for its operations to be overhauled after a slump in the proportion of its revenues going to those causes and growing concerns that its scratchcards and online games fuel problem gambling.  Instant games now offered by the lottery operator, such as Red Hot 7s and Mega Cash Showdown, offer prizes of up to £1m and can be played on smartphones, but pay out less to good causes because more cash is given in prizes to help drive sales. Sir Iain Duncan Smith, vice-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on gambling-related harm, said: “There should be a fixed percentage on the amount that goes to good causes. The operator is beginning to look like any other gambling company.” Calls for a review of the lottery and a national debate on its future come as rivals bid for a new licence to run it from 2024. A decision on the successful applicant is expected within the next two months. Lottery operator Camelot gave 28% of its revenues to good causes in the year to 31 March 2010, but its most recent accounts show the proportion given has fallen to less than 23%. The operator says it has still significantly increased the amount paid to good causes because of the rise in revenues over the same period, from £5.5bn a year to £8.4bn a year. The lottery was launched under prime minister Sir John Major in November 1994. One of his aims was to give more funding to Olympic sport, which, as the single gold medal won by GB’s athletes at the Atlanta Games in 1996 demonstrated, badly needed the money. The first scratchcards were launched in March 1995. Scratchcards sold in stores and instant online games now account for 44% of the lottery’s total revenues. About 31% of the income from draw-based games goes to good causes, compared with about 9% from scratchcards and 12% from instant-win games. There are concerns that scratchcards and online instant-win games are more likely to be associated with problem gambling than the traditional weekly draw. Heather Wardle, an expert on gambling research at Glasgow University, said there was a significant association between scratchcards and problem gambling. She said: “Engagement in traditional lotteries does decline over time and companies rely on products like scratchcards and they are more risky.” Charles Ritchie, who lost his son Jack to gambling-related suicide and is co-founder of the charity Gambling With Lives, said: “Online games are very different from the weekly lottery draw. These are instant-win games and can be played fast. Often they’re no different to online casino games and slots that are incredibly addictive and harmful to mental health.” The companies hoping to oust Camelot include the Czech lottery operator Sazka, which operates lotteries across Europe, through a special-purpose vehicle called Allwyn. It is headed in the UK by Sir Keith Mills, who helped win the 2012 Olympic bid for London. The other bidders are the Italian operator Sisal, which is being taken over by Flutter, the gambling giant that operates Paddy Power and Betfair, and media tycoon Richard Desmond, who owns the Health Lottery. The bid is being conducted in strict secrecy and bidders have been told publicity material must first be vetted by officials at the Gambling Commission, the betting regulator that is overseeing the process. Matt Zarb-Cousin, director of the campaign group Clean Up Gambling, said: “We should be having a national conversation about the future of the lottery, but instead the Gambling Commission is running the process for the licence as if it’s a military contract.” The government announced in December 2020 its decision to raise the age for playing the national lottery from 16 to 18, including scratchcards. The Gambling Commission says there are controls in lottery games to prevent excessive play and approved rules and procedures for each game. The Gambling Commission said this weekend the lower rate of return from instant games was because the higher prize payouts were “necessary to drive the optimal level of sales of these products”. The commission said the confidentiality arrangements around the bidding process protected the “integrity of the competition”. Camelot said: “Focusing solely on the amount generated for good causes in percentage terms paints a deliberately misleading and damaging picture of the health of the national lottery. By making the national lottery more attractive and generous to players, we’re delivering record sales, prize money and payments in lottery duty to the Treasury. Annual returns to good causes are now over £500m higher than they were at the start of this licence, even though the percentage rate of return is lower.” The lottery operator says its products are very different from those offered in the mainstream gambling sector and data showed the risk of problem play associated with lottery products was very low. It said: “We abide by rigorous controls, with numerous checks and balances in place to ensure that lottery games are safe and enjoyable for players.”",News/Politics,Calls to overhaul lottery after good causes get a smaller slice of pie ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/09/calls-to-overhaul-lottery-after-good-causes-get-a-smaller-slice-of-pie
1/9/2022,"Acouple of years ago, Alec Soth, the great road-tripping witness of American life, decided to retrace the path of the most famous funeral procession in his nation’s history: the train journey that carried assassinated President Lincoln’s 6ft 4in corpse from Washington DC to his home town of Springfield, Illinois. The steam-powered cortege was witnessed by millions of Americans, among them the poet Walt Whitman, who was moved to write his elegy, When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom’d. Soth set out on his journey with a line from Whitman’s poem in his head – “And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls, To adorn the burial house of him I love?” – and a notion “to mourn the divisiveness in [contemporary] America”. Soth made his name as a photographer with Sleeping By the Mississippi, his landmark 2002 journey along the human margins of the storied river. He quickly found the polemical impetus of his Lincoln project too confining. He continued his journey but adopted another more freewheeling line from Whitman instead: “From this hour I ordain myself loos’d of limits and imaginary lines, Going where I list…” He followed his eye, rather than his head.  The result is a book, A Pound of Pictures, which free-associates around some of the themes of that original project. Most of Soth’s images are taken of roadside oddities – a woman measuring “the girthiest sycamore in Michigan”, for example, or a wedding party stranded waiting for a bus. Connections and themes emerge. One is a sense of people searching among wasteland wildflowers for something unknown. You are reminded that Whitman was a great butterfly hunter – there is a famous photograph of the poet with a moth on his finger (it later turned out to be made of paper). Soth’s moth on an orange segment is real enough, another surprise interloper among his images, staring back at you with a predatory warning eye. A Pound of Pictures by Alec Soth is published by Mack. An accompanying exhibition runs at Sean Kelly Gallery, New York, from 14 January to 26 February",Arts/Art and design,The big picture: Alec Soth’s American road trip oddities,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/09/the-big-picture-alec-soths-american-road-trip-oddities
1/9/2022,"According to the writers of And Just Like That, HBO’s fascinatingly appalling Sex and the City reboot, it’s really perfectly easy to find contentment as a middle-aged single woman. In episode four, the recently widowed Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) returns to her old bachelor-girl flat, a place she kept on (because she is rich) untenanted after her marriage. There, having slept soundly for the first time in weeks, she pulls on a long tulle skirt that makes her look a bit like a fairy, and heads out to her local bodega to pick up a free coffee from its kindly owner. There is, we can’t help but notice, a spring in her step now, and thus the hapless viewer receives the message loud and clear. Happiness, it would seem, is only a simple matter of determination. Stride briskly on in your favourite outlandish clothes, a paper cup in your right hand and a mobile phone in your left, and daily rapture will be yours. In her new book, I Came All This Way to Meet You: Writing Myself Home, the American novelist Jami Attenberg has a lot to say about writing; ostensibly, her first work of nonfiction is determined to stare hardest at the creative life, and all that such an existence involves (in summary: a lot of hard work, a certain amount of luck, and very little cash). As the daughter of a travelling salesman, she’s interested, too, in a certain kind of transience. For many years, she found it hard to settle. Attenberg was 45 before she owned a bed; she once slept in 26 different places in seven months. In the end, however, she just can’t help herself. The truth must be told.  Ultimately, her memoir is about what it is like not to have, nor even much to want, all the things that are supposed to make a woman complete. If it is wonderful to be free – to be the kind of unicorn that judges yourself, not according to the putrid benchmarks of a sexist society, but by your own standards – this doesn’t mean that it isn’t also, sometimes, painful. For Attenberg, as for Carrie Bradshaw, happiness and being alone are not mutually exclusive. But as she also notes, expressing such a truth in public for the first time may still “feel like a specific kind of death”. Her memoir is, in other words, a powerful antidote to pernicious fantasies of the tulle-skirt-and-soya-latte kind. I don’t mean it as a criticism when I say that Attenberg’s book has an untidy, artless structure. Yes, its narrative, which moves repeatedly back and forth in time, is often in danger of seeming repetitive, and perhaps it comes with one too many Zoom meetings (it is something of a pandemic book, I think). But such restlessness reflects its subject matter: the sublets that come and go; the thousands of miles travelled in pursuit of minuscule sales at bookshop readings (it wasn’t until 2013, when her fourth novel, The Middlesteins, appeared on the New York Times bestseller list, that Attenberg had anything even approaching a literary hit). When success arrives at last, our one-time couch surfer finds that she cannot say no, and thanks to this she attends literary festivals all over the world, and teaches creative writing in Vilnius, Lithuania. Flying causes her intense anxiety, but still she does it, relying on Xanax “borrowed” from friends – she has so many! – to see her through. What she needs, she comes to realise, as the “vibrations” of her youth begin at last to subside, is a home. She doesn’t want carpets strewn with toys; marital cosiness (smugness?) isn’t for her. But there is a moment, staying with a friend in Evanston, Illinois, when she considers the contents of a family-size refrigerator – six packs of yoghurt, freshly squeezed juice, an entire drawer devoted to cheese – and experiences a pang of envy. Where is her place? For a long time, it will be a loft in (pre-gentrification) Williamsburg, Brooklyn, a ramshackle cavern, all thin walls and exposed pipes, described in a love letter that is one of the best pieces of writing in her book. Finally, though, this won’t do. It’s in New Orleans that she will buy a room of her own, one that comes with a view of hummingbirds and loquat trees. The resistance you detect in her as she writes of this beloved house – she always had a room of her own in her head, she insists – only makes this the sweeter as you read of it. Similarly, her cheeriness – her absolute disdain for self-pity – only serves to make the sad parts of her book seem the more plangent. Those who love Attenberg’s novels – for me, All Grown Up (2017) is one of the best, most spirited and most enjoyable books ever written about a mostly single woman – will recognise her tone here, even if parts of this work do border on self-obsession (not that I particularly blame her for being self-obsessed; this, too, is something society forces on women, for we can never live up to expectations, falling back always on self-recrimination, self-improvement and, worst of all, hour-by-hour analyses of our moods). Attenberg recounts it all – the bad men, and the bad friends, the sexual assaults and the restaurants that won’t provide a table for one – in a way that is at once a kind of reckoning, as dramatic as this sounds, and effortlessly casual. Haven’t these things happened to all women? If they’re grave, they are also quotidian. She’s very funny, and it’s this that makes her marvellous. When a man with whom she’s about to have sex for the first time – “we made our way towards nudity” – suddenly produces a brown paper bag in bed, all she can wonder is whether there’s a sandwich in it. In fact, it contains an unrequested sex toy. I laughed out loud at this. Here is the kind of determination I favour. Life is funny and grim (or, if you prefer, grimly funny). Forget this and, like the writers now desperately trying to make Sarah Jessica Parker relevant again, you’ve got what Attenberg would doubtless call Bad Art.

1/9/2022,"Welcome to the supermarkets of the future. They may look and feel like the supermarkets we are all used to – and stock the same bread, butter and bananas – but these shops are now fitted out with more than £1m of the latest technology that their bosses promise will put an end to our biggest frustration (queueing) and our most persistent crime (shoplifting). Jill French, a legal secretary in her 30s, wearing a sharp navy suit and matching beret, has just left a Tesco Express on London’s Holborn Viaduct empty-handed. It’s coming up to 6.30pm on a Thursday and, like dozens of others, French has popped in for a few essentials on her way home. “I just went in to grab pasta, milk and some broccoli,” she says. “But there was such a queue I got frustrated and walked out.”  An eight-minute walk away is another near-identical Tesco Express where there are no queues. This shop is the cleverest of all the 2,700 Tescos in the UK. There are no checkouts (self-scanning or traditional), no checkout assistants, and – in theory – no chance of shoplifting. This Tesco, called GetGo, is filled with thousands of cameras, weighted shelves and artificial-intelligence technology that watches your every move, figures out what you’ve bought and bills you directly as you walk out. It’s not just Tesco that is trialling these new “smart” supermarkets. Retailers across the UK, and the rest of the world, are racing to deploy rival technology. The model for all of them is similar. First, you must download an app, register a credit card and scan a QR code on your phone to enter through train station-style gates. Barriers prevent those without the app from entering the shop. Once inside, the technology follows you around the store recording every item you pick up (and put back). When you’re done you just walk out and after a few minutes your phone alerts you as to how much you’ve spent. The supermarkets say time-pressed, easily frustrated people are crying out for a better, hassle-free shopping experience, and if these trial stores are successful they will roll out the technology across the country. It’s almost 74 years since the first British supermarket opened in Manor Park, east London. At this branch of the London Cooperative Society, customers could walk round the store and take items off the shelves by themselves. It was revolutionary. In the years before, shoppers had to present the shopkeeper at a counter with a list of items that their assistants would fetch. Choosing your own tomatoes was banned, and touching the products could lead to prosecution. As with many innovations, the “self-service” supermarket concept was exported from the US, where retail pioneer Clarence Saunders opened Piggly Wiggly in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1916. If you’re wondering about the name, Saunders said it was named “so people will ask that very question”. Today all shops, big or small, follow a similar concept. But our retail needs are evolving. The days of “the big weekly shop” are over, with Britons going to a supermarket at least twice a week, according to YouGov, while a growing minority admit to popping in more than twice a day. The new generation of AI stores is meant to respond to these changes, but are there dangers in tinkering with one of the last remaining social levellers? Supermarkets are more than just places to buy food; they provide a space for a daily mixing of people of different classes and backgrounds in our increasingly siloed world. If AI takes over, will those without access to the latest smartphone be barred from the great supermarket melting pot? Will lonely older people lose their friendly chat with the cashier, which could be their only conversation of the day? Research backs up the retailers’ hunch about our frustrations with shopping. A recent survey by packaging company DS Smith found that more than a third of 2,000 people polled would walk out of the store rather than wait five minutes in a checkout queue, and 46% said they were so irritated by queuing that they would consider not coming back to the shop again. Laura Saunter, a senior retail analyst at the consumer trends analytic firm WGSN, says supermarkets have spent years trying to bust queues because they are the customers’ “number one pain point”. Many of us are now so impatient that waiting a few minutes for a checkout assistant to become free can feel like an unacceptable hassle in a world where technology dominates and instant gratification is expected. “These stores are positioned at millennial parents who are busy; they want to be in and out, they don’t want to waste their time,” Saunter says. And younger people, generation Z, just don’t want to interact with store staff.” Tesco has already tested the technology at its employee-only supermarket in Welwyn Garden City for more than a year. Amazon has 15 stores that use similar technology, including one almost directly across the street from the Tesco on Holborn. The supermarkets’ analytics teams seem to have a thing for the central London neighbourhood with Sainsbury’s also opening a trial smart supermarket on the same street in late November. The race is on. Aldi is preparing to open a similar smart store in Greenwich, south London. Morrisons is testing its own vision of the technology, codenamed Project Sarah, at its Bradford headquarters, and plans to quickly roll out dozens of small stores at busy locations. Another two of the Amazon stores opened in Chingford and East Sheen shortly before Christmas. A recent leak of internal documents reveals that these are just baby steps on to the UK high street for Amazon, which was founded by the world’s second-richest person, Jeff Bezos, in 1995 and is now the second-largest retailer on the planet, collecting sales of more than $1.2bn (£900m) every day. The internet giant is planning to open about 60 more UK stores next year, followed by 100 in 2023 and another 100 in 2024, according to a report by the blog Business Insider. Amazon has long been accused of attempting to kill off the high street by encouraging us all to buy almost everything online. But could its desire to now open bricks-and-mortar stores revitalise our urban centres? All of the supermarkets say the technology is designed to make shoppers’ lives easier, but experts say the real desire is to improve their bottom line as they can cut back on the wage bill and save some of the £5.5bn lost every year to shoplifting and employee theft. The most frequently stolen items from UK stores include spirits, sirloin steaks, razor blades, cosmetics, infant formula and batteries, according to the Centre for Retail Research (CRR). Cheese also makes the top 10, with posh bries and aged camembert often stolen to order by restaurants. Retailers in Scandinavia are ahead of the UK, opening shops without checkout assistants, security guards or any other members of staff present. Instead, customers use their phones to open the doors of shipping container-like stores, shop completely alone and walk out to the beep of the bill notification on their phone. In less than three years, Stockholm-based start-up Lifvs has opened 29 of the tiny stores in remote villages across Sweden, which in some instances had lost their last corner shops decades ago. Giulia Ray, a beekeeper in the village of Veckholm, 60 miles east of Stockholm, said the opening of the Lifvs “shopping box” added to rather than took away from community spirit. “You go inside and get something, and maybe someone else is here and you can have a chat,” she says as she picks up essentials and restocks the shelves with her own honey at the same time. While fitting out supermarkets with the new technology costs about £1m-per-store, the firms installing it claim it will pay for itself within 18 months because it will hopefully eliminate theft. “With this technology, you can’t really steal, we know who is in the store and we know where all the products are,” says Yair Holtzer, who helped develop the technology for Trigo, an Israeli firm that fitted out the Tesco store, and is working with other major retailers across the world. “With these systems it cuts out not just shoplifting but also mistakes, errors and employee fraud,” he says. “These are problems that all retailers have, and could be solved.” Supermarkets lose about 1.4% of their combined £200bn annual revenue to “shrinkage” – industry code for customer or employee theft and admin errors. Professor Joshua Bamfield, director of the CRR, says supermarkets thought they had found a solution to queue frustration and high wage bills with the introduction of self-scanning machines that were rolled out in the early 2000s and are now ubiquitous. “But it is very easy for customers to skip a few items through without scanning the barcode,” he says. “It’s quite easy to get away with things that you wouldn’t be able to at a staffed till.” Probe a little, and even the most upstanding friends and acquaintances have a shoplifting tale – from the south London primary school teacher who makes a point of stealing one item in every shop to the writer who was tapped on the shoulder by a security guard who’d seen her tap the screen for one banana when she bagged two. A study by the University of Leicester’s criminology department found that theft from stores with self-checkout machines was between 33 and 147% higher than those with only traditional checkouts. The researchers also found that the number of self-checkout machines available to use was correlated to the level of theft. In response, shops have cut down on the number of self-checkout machines available per staff member which, Bamfield says, explains why supermarkets often annoyingly place out-of-order stickers on working terminals. Supermarkets, including Tesco, have also begun installing screens on self-checkouts showing a livestream of customers scanning their items. “They’re reminding you that every action you take is being filmed,” says Bamfield. “It’s like the shop saying, ‘Are you sure you want to steal?’” It’s not just customers who steal. Bamfield’s research shows that about £1.4bn a year is lost to shoplifting, followed closely by £1.3bn in employee theft. The new technology is designed to tackle that, too. “It might not seem so obvious, but a big proportion of theft is due to staff on the take, and by removing staff from tills this technology will eliminate that loss,” he says. Bamfield believes the most common technique staff use to steal is referred to in the industry as “the switcheroo”. “An uncle will say to his cashier nephew, ‘I’m coming into the store tomorrow afternoon and I’d like a discount,’” he explains. “When the uncle comes to the checkout, the nephew will have a barcode sticker for a watermelon or orange or something on his palm and while pretending to scan the uncle’s bottles of scotch whisky the nephew will scan the watermelon sticker.” Bamfield, who has spent a career working with retailers, and has written a book on shoplifting (Waterstones describes his 2012 title Shopping and Crime as “an interdisciplinary study of retail crime as a cultural phenomenon”), isn’t sure the new checkout-free supermarkets will succeed in eliminating shoplifting altogether. “I was at a retail conference in Norwich, and one of the speakers flashed up a picture of one of these new stores and said, ‘Well, that is the end of shoplifting.’ But, we just don’t know yet how good this technology will be at reducing theft.” Shoplifting, which was first documented in the 16th century, began soaring in 2014 after the law was changed to define “low-value shoplifting” as a summary offence. This means that police forces can decide not to investigate thefts from shops of goods worth less than £200. Anyone caught stealing less than £200-worth of goods can still be arrested and face prosecution, but the 2014 antisocial behaviour, crime and policing act allows them to plead guilty by post. Police in England and Wales recorded 374,000 incidents of shoplifting in 2019 (the latest figures available), up from 317,000 in 2013, before the law changed. Retailers have responded with more technology. Sainsbury’s is experimenting with machine-learning “concealment detector” technology to monitor and record when shoppers place an item in their pocket and alert in-store security guards in real time. Sainsbury’s says its 30-store trial partnership with UK artificial intelligence startup ThirdEye has helped cut theft from its spirits aisles by 47%. Razwan Ghafoor, co-founder and chief executive of ThirdEye, says the technology helps make CCTV smarter. “You can have hundreds of cameras in a store, but which feed should you be watching?” Ghafoor says on the phone from Heathrow as he boards a plane to New York the day after selling ThirdEye to larger rival Standard AI for millions of pounds. “We’ve taught the system to learn when someone picks up an item and pockets it. The system will flag it and send a four-second clip to a human to investigate. It means the security team can watch a lot less footage and concentrate on the footage they need to watch.” No queues, less shoplifting, lower wage bills: the benefits of this new generation of hi-tech supermarkets are clear. But campaigners are concerned they represent another step in the UK’s march towards an “everyday surveillance society”. “Going to the supermarket is one of the most mundane, everyday things we do. The fact that surveillance and data gathering in such a space is being normalised is deeply troubling,” says Emmanuelle Andrews, policy and campaigns officer at human rights group Liberty. “Shopping should be one of the great levellers, where the businessman in the sharp suit is shoulder-to-shoulder with the pensioner on benefits. Everyone has to buy food, but with this technology only those with a smartphone and credit cards will be able to shop there.” In the near term, the biggest losers from this technological revolution are likely to be Britain’s army of 270,000 checkout workers, most of whom are women. The pandemic has already hit retail workers hard, with some 190,000 jobs lost since the start of the first lockdown in March 2020. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has identified supermarket cashier jobs as among the most at risk of being replaced by automation, with 65% of checkout-operator jobs said to be in peril. “The checkout-free technology is specifically designed to eliminate jobs, and save money,” says Dr Carl Benedikt Frey, an Oxford University economist and expert on automation whose research the ONS statistics are based on. Up to 47% of all jobs could be done by machines “over the next decade or two”, he believes. Frey predicts that checkout workers are likely to be among the first to lose their jobs to the robots, alongside bar staff, farm workers and sewing machinists. Supermarkets have offered stable employment to generations of Britons excluded from higher-skilled roles, providing modest but reliable incomes – and the prospect of advancement – in communities blighted by manufacturing decline. Frey fears that a national rollout of AI stores would send the checkout worker the same way as the elevator operator, which as of today is the only one of 270 job descriptions listed in the 1950 US census to be completely eliminated by automation. “We think this coming change is unprecedented, but actually what is happening mirrors what we saw in the Industrial Revolution and hollowing out of middle-income jobs,” he says. “The technology is very different, but the effects on the economy are quite similar.” Back in that Holborn Tesco, among the familiar daily groceries, a change is coming that could herald the biggest revolution in how we shop for groceries since the opening of the first supermarket on 12 January 1948. Like their predecessors, the smart supermarkets are said to be designed to make our lives easier. But is it time to allow the shop assistant to follow the elevator operator into obsolescence, or could we all learn to wait a little longer and enjoy a friendly chat at the checkout?",News/Business,Do smart supermarkets herald the end of shopping as we know it?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/09/do-smart-supermarkets-herald-the-end-of-shopping-as-we-know-it
1/9/2022,"Joe Biden had spent a year in the hope that America could go back to normal. But last Thursday, the first anniversary of the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol, the president finally recognised the full scale of the current threat to American democracy. “At this moment, we must decide,” Biden said in Statuary Hall, where rioters had swarmed a year earlier. “What kind of nation are we going to be? Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm?”  It is a question that many inside America and beyond are now asking. In a deeply divided society, where even a national tragedy such as 6 January only pushed people further apart, there is fear that that day was the just the beginning of a wave of unrest, conflict and domestic terrorism. A slew of recent opinion polls show a significant minority of Americans at ease with the idea of violence against the government. Even talk of a second American civil war has gone from fringe fantasy to media mainstream. “Is a Civil War ahead?” was the blunt headline of a New Yorker magazine article this week. “Are We Really Facing a Second Civil War?” posed the headline of a column in Friday’s New York Times. Three retired US generals wrote a recent Washington Post column warning that another coup attempt “could lead to civil war”. The mere fact that such notions are entering the public domain shows the once unthinkable has become thinkable, even though some would argue it remains firmly improbable. The anxiety is fed by rancour in Washington, where Biden’s desire for bipartisanship has crashed into radicalized Republican opposition. The president’s remarks on Thursday – “I will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy” – appeared to acknowledge that there can be no business as usual when one of America’s major parties has embraced authoritarianism. Illustrating the point, almost no Republicans attended the commemorations as the party seeks to rewrite history, recasting the mob who tried to overturn Trump’s election defeat as martyrs fighting for democracy. Tucker Carlson, the most watched host on the conservative Fox News network, refused to play any clips of Biden’s speech, arguing that 6 January 2021 “barely rates as a footnote” historically because “really not a lot happened that day”. With the cult of Trump more dominant in the Republican party than ever, and radical rightwing groups such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys on the march, some regard the threat to democracy as greater now than it was a year ago. Among those raising the alarm is Barbara Walter, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, and author of a new book, How Civil Wars Start: And How to Stop Them. Walter previously served on the political instability taskforce, an advisory panel to the CIA, which had a model to predict political violence in countries all over the world – except the US itself. Yet with the rise of Trump’s racist demagoguery, Walter, who has studied civil wars for 30 years, recognized telltale signs on her own doorstep. One was the emergence of a government that is neither fully democratic nor fully autocratic – an “anocracy”. The other is a landscape devolving into identity politics where parties no longer organise around ideology or specific policies but along racial, ethnic or religious lines. Walter told the Observer: “By the 2020 elections, 90% of the Republican party was now white. On the taskforce, if we were to see that in another multiethnic, multi-religious country which is based on a two-party system, this is what we would call a super faction, and a super faction is particularly dangerous.” Not even the gloomiest pessimist is predicting a rerun of the 1861-65 civil war with a blue army and red army fighting pitched battles. “It would look more like Northern Ireland and what Britain experienced, where it’s more of an insurgency,” Walter continued. “It would probably be more decentralized than Northern Ireland because we have such a large country and there are so many militias all around the country.” “They would turn to unconventional tactics, in particular terrorism, maybe even a little bit of guerrilla warfare, where they would target federal buildings, synagogues, places with large crowds. The strategy would be one of intimidation and to scare the American public into believing that the federal government isn’t capable of taking care of them.” A 2020 plot to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, could be a sign of things to come. Walter suggests that opposition figures, moderate Republicans and judges deemed unsympathetic might all become potential assassination targets. “I could also imagine situations where militias, in conjunction with law enforcement in those areas, carve out little white ethnostates in areas where that’s possible because of the way power is divided here in the United States. It would certainly not look anything like the civil war that happened in the 1860s.” Walter notes that most people tend to assume civil wars are started by the poor or oppressed. Not so. In America’s case, it is a backlash from a white majority destined to become a minority by around 2045, an eclipse symbolized by Barack Obama’s election in 2008. The academic explained: “The groups that tend to start civil wars are the groups that were once dominant politically but are in decline. They’ve either lost political power or they’re losing political power and they truly believe that the country is theirs by right and they are justified in using force to regain control because the system no longer works for them.” A year after the 6 January insurrection, the atmosphere on Capitol Hill remains toxic amid a breakdown of civility, trust and shared norms. Several Republican members of Congress received menacing messages, including a death threat, after voting for an otherwise bipartisan infrastructure bill that Trump opposed. The two Republicans on the House of Representatives select committee investigating the 6 January attack, Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, face calls to be banished from their party. Democrat Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a Somali-born Muslim, has suffered Islamophobic abuse. Yet Trump’s supporters argue that they are the ones fighting to save democracy. Last year Congressman Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina said: “If our election systems continue to be rigged and continue to be stolen, then it’s going to lead to one place and that’s bloodshed.” Last month Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has bemoaned the treatment of 6 January defendants jailed for their role in the attack, called for a “national divorce” between blue and red states. Democrat Ruben Gallego responded forcefully: “There is no ‘National Divorce’. Either you are for civil war or not. Just say it if you want a civil war and officially declare yourself a traitor.” There is also the prospect of Trump running for president again in 2024. Republican-led states are imposing voter restriction laws calculated to favour the party while Trump loyalists are seeking to take charge of running elections. A disputed White House race could make for an incendiary cocktail. James Hawdon, director of the Center for Peace Studies and Violence Prevention at Virginia Tech university, said: “I don’t like to be an alarmist, but the country has been moving more and more toward violence, not away from it. Another contested election may have grim consequences.” Although most Americans have grown up taking its stable democracy for granted, this is also a society where violence is the norm, not the exception, from the genocide of Native Americans to slavery, from the civil war to four presidential assassinations, from gun violence that takes 40,000 lives a year to a military-industrial complex that has killed millions overseas. Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: “America is not unaccustomed to violence. It is a very violent society and what we’re talking about is violence being given an explicit political agenda. That’s a kind of terrifying new direction in America.” While he does not currently foresee political violence becoming endemic, Jacobs agrees that any such unravelling would also be most likely to resemble Northern Ireland’s Troubles. “We would see these episodic, scattered terrorist attacks,” he added. “The Northern Ireland model is the one that frankly most fear because it doesn’t take a huge number of people to do this and right now there are highly motivated, well-armed groups. The question is, has the FBI infiltrated them sufficiently to be able to knock them out before they they’ve launch a campaign of terror?” “Of course, it doesn’t help in America that guns are prevalent. Anyone can get a gun and you have ready access to explosives. All of this is kindling for the precarious position we now find ourselves in.” Nothing, though, is inevitable. Biden also used his speech to praise the 2020 election as the greatest demonstration of democracy in US history with a record 150 million-plus people voting despite a pandemic. Trump’s bogus challenges to the result were thrown out by what remains a robust court system and scrutinised by what remains a vibrant civil society and media. In a reality check, Josh Kertzer, a political scientist at Harvard University, tweeted: “I know a lot of civil war scholars, and … very few of them think the United States is on the precipice of a civil war.” And yet the assumption that “it can’t happen here,” is as old as politics itself. Walter has interviewed many survivors about the lead-up to civil wars. “What everybody said, whether they were in Baghdad or Sarajevo or Kiev, was we didn’t see it coming,” she recalled. “In fact, we weren’t willing to accept that anything was wrong until we heard machine gun fire in the hillside. And by that time, it was too late.”",News/US news,Is the US really heading for a second civil war?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/09/is-the-us-really-heading-for-a-second-civil-war
1/9/2022,"Apart from his bad luck in being struck twice by the need to go into isolation from Covid, the leader of the opposition, Sir Keir Starmer has a huge, indeed historic, weight on his shoulders. To put it bluntly: this government is so appalling that if, as it hopes, it is re-elected either this year or next, many of us will be seriously tempted to emigrate. The sleaze that finally overturned one of the safest Tory seats in the land, namely North Shropshire, brought to mind a line in Imperium, a novel by my old friend Robert Harris: Cicero (for it is the fictional he) describes a dodgy politician as “giving corruption a bad name”.  The reaction to the Johnson government in the polls, and in voluminous acres of the hitherto supine Tory press, may be heartening to Starmer, but only up to a point. What we are witnessing – and, goodness, it has taken time – is the eternal wisdom of that great observation attributed to Abraham Lincoln: “You can fool all of the people some of the time and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.” It is reassuring to those of us who are unrepentant Remainers that the wider public appears to be waking up to the economically and socially damaging impact of Brexit. This development, along with the chaotic sleaze of Johnson’s government, is giving rise to open rebellion within the Tory ranks, and speculation about who will succeed him. The problem is that the candidates are all of the same mould: in horseracing terms, they are sired by Brexit, and their dam is Austerity. The point about Brexit, as emphasised in Lord Frost’s resignation letter from his post as chief negotiator, is that it was a neoliberal coup to make this country “a lightly regulated, low-tax, entrepreneurial economy, at the cutting edge of modern science and economic change”. No matter that Frost, before the referendum, was on record as acknowledging that we were better off within the EU; no matter that all that stuff about being at the “cutting edge” is so much cant; the main point is that in attempting, in Lord Lawson’s notorious words, “to finish the Thatcher revolution” with Brexit, the Brexiters were opposing the social-democratic, interventionist nature of the EU in favour of giving free rein to “market forces” and English nationalism. But they were abandoning a market that really mattered: the single market, an enlightened intergovernmental creation championed by Thatcher. What Starmer needs to do is stop trying to pacify “red wall” former Labour voters and get across to them that Brexit was essentially a war against them, and against the socially compassionate nature of the founding principles of the EU, principles that have been made a mockery of by the long squeeze on the NHS and social services generally. In his magnum opus The Betrayal of Liberal Economics, Prof Amos Witztum laments the way that, because “collectivism” or state provision is associated with the political tyranny of communist regimes, there has been, since the collapse of the USSR, “another form of unnoticed oppression: the tyranny of markets”. He suggests: “Instead of subjugating all public provision to the scrutiny of markets, we should subjugate markets to the scrutiny of socially constructed criteria.” Now, I have noticed that there have been many references recently to the debt we owe to Clement Attlee, Labour prime minister from 1945 to 51, by whose beneficent administration the NHS was founded. Starmer for one, has been singing his praises. Attlee, like Franklin Roosevelt before him in the US, sought the right balance between private and public provision. The ideological Brexiters do not. One of the reasons Frost adduces for his resignation is that Johnson is “going in the wrong direction” by planning to raise taxes and increase public provision, even though this is the forced consequence of the costs of dealing with Covid. Chancellor Sunak has made it plain he wants to cut taxes before the next election. Johnson is actually unpopular among many of his colleagues for being a “big spender”. The thrust of the policies of such potential successors to Johnson as Sunak, or the one and only Liz Truss, would be the Brexit doctrine of low taxes and concomitant austerity. What they do not appear to take into account is that by knocking 4% off GDP with Brexit (the OBR’s estimate), they have damaged prospective tax revenues so badly that their tax-cutting plans have horrifying implications for public services. Or perhaps that does not worry them. Attlee must be turning in his grave. I am sure Starmer and his advisers are aware of the implications of all this. They should be championing the EU, and not be embarrassed by their association with the Remain campaign. Let us hope they can bring home the electoral bacon. I really do not wish to have to emigrate.",News/Business,Neoliberal Brexiters are no friends of the ‘red wall’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/09/neoliberal-brexiters-are-no-friends-of-the-red-wall
1/9/2022,"The family of a man who died suddenly after being released from police custody are calling on the attorney general and home secretary to intervene and demand that the police watchdog release bodycam and CCTV footage showing the final hours of his life. Mohamud Mohammed Hassan, 24, died hours after he was released from Cardiff Bay police station a year ago. He was arrested at his Cardiff home on suspicion of breach of the peace, but released without charge.  His family said he had claimed he was assaulted in custody before his death. A postmortem later failed to establish a cause. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) served notices to five police officers and one custody detention officer, advising them their conduct is subject to investigation. In a statement released on the one-year anniversary of the death, the family said: “We have repeatedly requested that the IOPC provide the family and our legal team access to the video showing the final hours of Mohamud’s life. Despite our repeated requests for access to film recording of the last hours of Mohamud’s life, the family have been consistently denied access by the IOPC. “We believe that all families of those that die in suspicious circumstances in police custody should have an automatic right enshrined in law to get immediate access to police bodycam footage showing exactly what happened during their final moments on this earth.” The family called on the attorney general, Suella Braverman, and home secretary Priti Patel to intervene and instruct the IOPC release all police bodycam and CCTV footage. The police watchdog said its investigation into police contact prior to the death of Hassan was nearing completion and a “substantial investigation report” was being finalised. The IOPC said its thoughts remain with Hassan’s family and friends. A spokesperson said the IOPC had kept the family, coroner and South Wales police updated on the progress of the investigation. Hilary Brown, the family’s legal representative, said: “The length of time it has taken for the IOPC to conclude their investigation is totally unacceptable. The family made requests early in the investigation to disclose the police bodycam and CCTV of Mohamud Hassan that both the IOPC and South Wales police have access to – which has still not been disclosed to the family. This failure has significantly contributed to the ongoing trauma suffered by the family. “This denial constitutes a cruel and unusual punishment for a family seeking nothing more than the truth as to what happened to their beloved Mohamud.” Catrin Evans, IOPC director for Wales, said: “While we appreciate how very difficult this past year has been for Mr Hassan’s family and their understandable need to know the circumstances surrounding his death, it has been vital that we pursue every possible line of inquiry. “We continue to liaise with the coroner, and work towards sharing video footage and other evidential material with Mr Hassan’s family and legal representative as soon as we are able. We also need to take account of the need to safeguard the inquest into his death, which may be heard before a jury, and other potential future proceedings.”",News/UK news,Family of man who died after release from custody demand police CCTV,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/09/family-of-man-who-died-after-release-from-custody-demand-police-cctv
1/9/2022,"Unthinkable is the perfect title for this extraordinary book, because it describes a superhuman feat.  Jamie Raskin is a fine writer, a Democratic congressman, a constitutional scholar and a deeply loving father. When 2020 began, he had no inkling that just 12 months later his country and his family would face “two impossible traumas”. On 31 December, his beautiful, brilliant, charismatic 25-year-old son, Tommy, took his own life. Six days later, a vicious mob invaded Raskin’s workplace, the cradle of democracy, leaving several dead and injuring 140 police officers. Raskin suffered “a violent and comprehensive shock to the foundations”. Never had he felt “so equidistant … between the increasingly unrecognizable place called life and the suddenly intimate and expanding jurisdiction called death”. This is where the superhuman part came in. Instead of succumbing to unfathomable grief over the death of his son, Raskin seized a lifeline thrown by the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and agreed to lead the effort to impeach Donald Trump for inciting the riot which might have derailed the peaceful transition of power. He found “salvation and sustenance … a pathway back to the land of the living”. “I’m not going to lose my son at the end of 2020 and lose my country and my republic in 2021,” he told CNN, less than three weeks after Tommy’s death. Raskin’s astonishing story of tragedy and redemption, of “despair and survival”, depended entirely on all the “good and compassionate people” like Tommy, “the non-narcissists, the feisty, life-size human beings who hate bullying and fascism naturally – people just the right size for a democracy … where we are all created equal”. Tommy Raskin was the fourth generation in a great liberal family. His maternal great grandfather was the first Jew elected to the Minnesota legislature. His father, Marcus Raskin, was one of the earliest opponents of the Vietnam war when he worked in the Kennedy White House. In 1968, Marcus Raskin was indicted with William Sloane Coffin, Dr Benjamin Spock and others for conspiracy to aid resistance to the draft. When Raskin was the only one acquitted, he famously demanded a retrial. Jamie Raskin taught constitutional law then ran for the Maryland Senate, with Tommy, then 10, his first campaign aide. In the state legislature, Raskin helped outlaw the death penalty and legalize same-sex marriage. Tommy was a second-year student at Harvard Law School when Covid began. Like so many others with clinical depression, the catastrophe deepened his symptoms. His father described his illness as “a kind of relentless torture in the brain … Despite very fine doctors and a loving family … the pain became overwhelming and unyielding and unbearable at last.” This is also a political memoir, of the Capitol attack and the second impeachment. Driving to the Capitol, Raskin spotted MAGA supporters heckling a young Black driver and a car with a bumper sticker reading: “If Guns Are Outlawed, How Am I Going To Shoot Liberals?” He realizes these “fascist bread crumbs throughout the city” should have activated “some kind of cultural alarm”. More chillingly, he reports the decision of some Democrats to cross their chamber after Congress was invaded, “because they thought a mass shooter who entered would be less likely to aim at the Republican side of the House”. But Raskin was never afraid: “The very worst thing that could ever have happened to us has already happened … and Tommy is with me somehow every step of the way. He is occupying my heart … He is showing me the way to some kind of safety … My wound has now become my shield of defense and my path to escape, and all I can think of is my son propelling me forward to fight.” The most powerful part of Raskin’s book, the heart-shattering part, is his love letter to Tommy, a “dazzling, precious, brilliant … moral visionary, a slam poet, an intellectual giant slayer, the king of Boggle, a natural-born comedian, a friend to all human beings but tyrants and bullies, a freedom fighter, a political essayist, a playwright, a jazz pianist, and a handsome, radical visitor from a distant future where war, mass hunger and the eating of animals are considered barbaric intolerable and absurd”. Raskin realized that for the last week of his life, his son had made an effort to impersonate someone in perfect mental health, so no one would intervene. These were his parting words: “Please forgive me. My illness won today. Please look after each other, the animals and the global poor for me. All my love, Tommy.” Raskin takes some solace remembering the story of Abraham Lincoln’s son Willie, who died of typhoid fever at the age of 12 in 1862, plunging his parents into depression. It had been a point of pride that Raskin responded to every constituent, but a deluge of condolences made that impossible. There was also a call from Joe Biden, three days after Tommy died. The president-elect promised “the day would come when Tommy’s name would bring a smile to my lip before tears to my eyes”. Eventually Raskin was convinced to write one letter for everyone sending condolences, one for everyone who wrote about impeachment and a third for everyone who offered condolences and political solidarity. One actually wrote: “I was looking for a condolence card for the loss of your son which also said ‘and thanks for saving our country too’, but Hallmark apparently doesn’t make those.” Naturally, one of Raskin’s son’s heroes was Wittgenstein, who believed the truth of ethical propositions is determined by the courage with which you act to make them real. “On this standard,” Raskin writes, “there have never been truer ethical claims than the ones made by Tommy Raskin, because he was all courage and engagement with his moral convictions.” May this book and Tommy’s example inspire us all to rescue our gravely beleaguered democracy.

1/9/2022,"The ballerina’s tutu remains a traditional object of desire for many young girls: an enduring emblem of diaphanous femininity, as well as the twirling centrepiece of many a childhood music box. But is its longstanding link with the world of professional dance now out of date? Several leading performers and choreographers think so, and while the twinkly costume of The Nutcracker’s Sugar Plum Fairy may not quite have been consigned to the wardrobe archives, its days may be numbered.  Late last year, the Royal Ballet’s former principal ballerina, Australian-born Leanne Benjamin, spoke candidly in public about falling out of love with the tutu. She would be happy never to wear one again, she confided to an audience at the Australian embassy gathered to mark the British launch of her autobiography, Built for Ballet. Traditional ballerina outfits had always felt constrictive to her, Benjamin said. Speaking to the Observer this weekend, the 57-year-old dancer and teacher admitted that the conventional shape does still have many fans among fellow performers. “The evolution of the tutu was designed to show off the leg,” she said, “In my book I discuss that personally I didn’t like wearing a tutu, but most of my contemporaries love wearing them.” Benjamin, who was at Covent Garden with Darcey Bussell, is clear that her views may not hold sway. “I am not a director of a company, so I speak as an onlooker now,” she said. “And I am not sure if gender distinctions come into the discussion. But tutus are a style of costume and the conversations now taking place may well affect decisions about what occurs. I think we all expect and enjoy evolution and so will welcome what comes next.” Back in Benjamin’s native land the national ballet company has announced a new season of work that will steer away from pretty costumes and orthodox stagings. Artistic director David Hallberg, who has been leading the Australian Ballet since last year, has not programmed any of the classic “tutu ballets”, such as Swan Lake, Giselle or The Sleeping Beauty, and is keen to take a break from bouncing layers of tulle. “I believe ballet audiences in Australia are very open to the new,” he recently told the Guardian. “There is an openness.” Tutus are not banned for good, Hallberg says, but he recognises his dancers welcome something different. “They’re not bogged down in tradition or by the patina of companies like the Bolshoi or Royal Ballet. They can absorb varying styles more easily than a dancer trained in the French, Russian or English style.” And this revolution in the wardrobe department is not confined to those of Australian birth. Tamara Rojo, the acclaimed Spanish ballerina who is artistic director of the English National Ballet at the Coliseum in London, is also turning away from the standard tutu in her first work as both choreographer and director. Although Rojo has chosen to present an established work – Raymonda by Alexander Glazunov and Marius Petipa – her approach is revisionist, if not radical. Not only will the costume conventions of the piece be laid aside, but the emphasis of the narrative is being reworked to reflect modern concerns. The ballet’s third act, in which Hungarian influences are usually clear in a grand wedding scene staged in the court of King Andrew II of Hungary, who had led the 1217 Crusades, Rojo has done away with the shimmering tutus and ornate trappings. Instead she is to show a chorus of European immigrants helping to pick the harvests for Raymonda on her land. And Jo Meredith, creative director of the UK’s National Youth Ballet, has also chosen to abandon many of the traditional stage orthodoxies for her latest production of Kurt Weill’s The Seven Deadly Sins. “Young ballet dancers generally have a very clear agenda and are very “on it” when it comes to questions of gender and stereotyping on stage,” she said. “The idea of gender neutral costumes also works very well with this show, which is set in the 1930s. We are going to put everyone in tuxedos.” It is a decision particularly well suited to a production from another era when visual androgyny was celebrated, but Meredith believes it could fit a ballet from any time. “We have used short classic tutus in the past, as well as the longer romantic tutus you often see in Giselle, or in many of Degas’s paintings,” she said. “But the idea of the ballerina is developing and, although there will always be a place for the Sugar Plum Fairy, it’s very interesting to see what Tamara is now doing with Raymonda at the Coliseum. It is a way of keeping ballet looking fresh and exciting.” Benjamin agrees that presenting historical works without the tutu from now on “would seem a shame”, but argues they are not always relevant in a reimagined production. She is not, she adds, urging that tutus should suddenly disappear. “I have seen how beautiful they can be and how they evolved. However, the reality is that you assess how the whole thing works together. “Look at how Stephen Galloway was inspired by the tutu to contemporise his costumes for William Forsythe’s new Vertiginous Thrill of Exactitude with Pacific Northwest Ballet last year – and how Serena Williams had her own take on it, wearing a tutu-style dress on the tennis court.”",Arts/Stage,The last dance?

1/9/2022,"With a zillion images of themselves to choose from, many taken by a reverent state photographer, Boris and Carrie Johnson used a picture of their dog, Dilyn, for their recent Christmas card. If unlikely to appeal to the current pope, the pet is, they presumably concluded, more generally inoffensive, ostensibly uninvolved in the family’s tireless requisitioning of free luxury goods and, on a more positive note, a pointed reminder of the household’s remaining claim to virtue. Or if that’s putting it too strongly: to their formal recognition as sentient beings.  For say what you like about his indifference to human welfare, not excluding that of close family members, the PM has, by his standards, worked tirelessly for lobsters. Better still, his wife, who’s employed by the Aspinall Foundation, a zookeeper so upmarket that it disdains zookeeping, is routinely described as an “animal rights campaigner”. There is talk of a Carrie wildlife show on Netflix. True, lizards, adders, insects and many other less immediately captivating creatures have yet to see the benefit of having, in Downing Street, these natural successors to Armand and Michaela Denis or the Born Free couple – but have we mentioned Dilyn, the famous rescue dog? Since the start of this administration, animals – occasionally held aloft for the purpose – have been the couple’s way of signalling that they are not, after all, shits. Johnson may have failed, for instance, to free Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, having idly blighted her hopes of liberation, but consider his work for badgers, following his girlfriend’s (as she then was) well-publicised intervention. In 2019 the future Mrs Johnson, after a briefing from Dominic Dyer, then CEO of the Badger Trust, got Johnson, not formerly known for any interest in animals beyond dressing up and killing them, to stop an imminent badger cull in Derbyshire. A judicial review, brought by the National Farmers’ Union, was later dismissed. Carrie Symonds went on to condemn trophy hunting, elephant rides and the fur trade and became Peta’s UK 2020 person of the year. “Symonds is a true ally to animals and her activism gets results,” Peta said, citing her condemnation of monkey labour. As for her husband, his government later produced an Action Plan for Animal Welfare, a characteristically boastful document in which George Eustice, the environment secretary, explained why, even as it discards EU regulation, the UK will lead the world in animal welfare. “The way we treat animals reflects our values and the kind of people we are,” he wrote. “We will continue to raise the bar and we intend to take the rest of the world with us.” A lesson in international bar-raising occurred sooner than anyone could have expected when, during the chaotic Kabul evacuation, the Johnsons intervened to save some of the dogs and cats collected by Pen Farthing’s charity, Nowzad. Farthing’s ally, Dominic Dyer, told the BBC he had again “reached out” to Symonds, and “forced the prime minister’s arm”. So it seems reasonable to ignore Downing Street’s denials, especially given the whistleblower Raphael Marshall’s evidence to the foreign affairs select committee. There was an “instruction from the Prime Minister” to evacuate Farthing’s dogs, zero policy justification for this and it came at a sickening cost. “There was a direct trade-off,” Marshall writes, “between transporting Nowzad’s animals and evacuating British nationals and Afghan evacuees, including Afghans who had served with British soldiers.” To balance this triumph for a UK brand of animal welfare so world-beating that it privileges pets over people, there are indications, however, that the government is not so much anti-speciesist as species selective. Had Farthing chosen to deliver neglected Afghan goats they would probably not, for all their sociability and cleverness, have inspired a Carrie Johnson mercy intervention. The RSPCA has already noted, following Liz Truss’s Australia trade deal (likely to be a template for others), that a government proudly sensitive on pet-smuggling and badger survival will happily surrender livestock standards for trade deals. Unless some new intervention is imminent, Dilyn’s owners, recently willing to trade interpreters’ lives for Farthing’s cats, have no problem with imported beef from cattle raised on “enormous bare feed-lots” and subjected to transport times of 48 hours and lamb from animals mutilated without anaesthetic. As applied to killing animals for fun, Johnson’s eclectic welfare principles could lead to yet more confusion in countries unfamiliar with the UK tradition of class-based animal protections. What, for instance, makes a UK badger’s welfare more worthy of consideration than a UK crow’s? The bird is famously brainy, capable of social learning, of reasoning and of using tools – quite likely more effective in that respect than Johnson, for all his opposable thumbs. Nest sanitation is, in contrast to the prime ministerial “tip”, a given. Their rank in Tory animal taxonomy dictates, however, that crows are among several wild creatures that can now, following an updating of the law, be more easily killed in order to protect game birds, which vastly outnumber all native British birds and are the cause of extensive ecological damage. Jackdaws, pigeons and rooks can be likewise sacrificed for a higher purpose: the subsequent slaughter of the protected game birds, by landowners, in still greater numbers. The RSPB said the revised regulations could be a “massive backward step for nature conservation”. Again, it’s not too late for another intervention by Mrs Johnson. Even if crows and pigs lack the superficial appeal of dolphins, monkeys and Dilyn the rescue dog, she might yet decide that some registered aversion to killing game birds for amusement, and to mistreating livestock for profit, is a minimum requirement for her career in animal welfare. Though admittedly no law says professional animal lovers must love all animals. The late Steve Irwin was killed harassing a stingray. And they’re still seeking a successor to Joe Exotic.

1/9/2022,"Josh Cavallo, who last year became the only openly gay professional top flight men’s footballer in the world, says he has “no words” to describe his disappointment at being targeted by homophobic abuse during an A-League Men game over the weekend. The Adelaide United player came on as a second-half substitute during the Reds’ away game at Melbourne Victory on Saturday night and said afterwards that he had received abuse from the crowd at AAMI Park.  The 22-year-old received acclaim from across the globe in October when he came out via Adelaide’s social media channels. Players past and present from Gerard Piqué, Raphaël Varane and Marcus Rashford to Gary Lineker, Robin van Persie and Joey Barton, plus clubs including Liverpool and Juventus, all lined up to show their support. But just two months later, Cavallo has found himself having to call out abuse from the stands. “I’m not going to pretend that I didn’t see or hear the homophobic abuse at the game last night,” Cavallo wrote on Instagram on Sunday. “There are no words to tell you how disappointed I was. As a society this shows we still face these problems in 2022. “This shouldn’t be acceptable and we need to do more to hold this [sic] people accountable. Hate never will win. I will never apologise for living my truth and most recently who I am outside of football.” Cavallo also said he was targeted after the game on Instagram and used his own post to call out the social media platform for the way it deals with homophobic abuse. “To Instagram I don’t want any child or adult to have to receive the hateful and hurtful messages that I’ve received,” he said. “I knew truly being who I am that I was going to come across this. It’s a sad reality that your platforms are not doing enough to stop these messages.” The Australian Professional Leagues said it was “shocked and saddened” to hear of the reports of the “homophobic bullying”. “Our players, staff and fans have the right to feel safe on and off the pitch,” APL CEO Danny Townsend said. “There is no place for bullying, harassment or abuse in Australian football and we have zero tolerance for this harmful behaviour.” The APL is working with both clubs to investigate the incident and it promised to issue sanctions to any people found to be involved. “We fully support Josh Cavallo and want to ensure he can focus on his football performance, rather than on vile abuse. We will continue to concentrate our efforts on creating safe and welcoming A-Leagues for all.” Cavallo said he was grateful for the support from individuals who made a stand at the game and for the positive messages he had received afterwards. He also had a message for others, particularly young people, who had been on the receiving end of similar abuse, telling them to “hold your heads up high and keep chasing your dreams”. “Know that there is no place in the game for this,” he wrote. “Football is a game for everyone no matter of who you are, what colour your skin is or where you come from.” Adelaide United said the “disappointing and upsetting” abuse would not be tolerated while the players’ union, Professional Footballers Australia, said “there is no place in our game, or society, for those who direct abhorrent abuse at others”. The Victory released a statement condemning the abuse and confirming it was investigating. “Melbourne Victory sees football as a platform to unite fans no matter what background,” it said. “Spectators found to have breached these standards will be banned from future matches.”",Sport/Football,‘No words’: gay Australian footballer Josh Cavallo calls out homophobic crowd abuse,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/09/no-words-gay-australian-footballer-josh-cavallo-calls-out-homophobic-crowd-abuse
1/9/2022,"The 6 January insurrection, when supporters of former US president Donald Trump stormed Capitol Hill, is widely viewed as a seminal moment in the history of US democracy. Never before had the modern nation witnessed such an organised, violent attempt to overthrow the elected government. Never before, not even at the height of the Civil War, had the Confederate flag flown over the halls of Congress. Yet last week, as the US marked the first anniversary of the thwarted insurrection, another significant turning point was reached. President Joe Biden, the lawful winner of the 2020 election and Trump’s principal intended victim, dropped what some call his Mr Nice Guy act. With gloves off, Biden came out swinging. It was about time.  Since taking office almost exactly one year ago, Biden has deliberately ignored Trump. He has rarely mentioned his predecessor by name. He has refused to engage with Trump’s insults, lies and unceasing propagation of the “big lie” – that Democrats stole the 2020 vote. Instead, Biden sought to reunite a divided, fractious nation, appealing to what he called our “better selves” and looking to the future, not the past. It didn’t work. That is not to say it was not worth trying, nor that the effort should be discontinued: it should not. But in the intervening 12 months, Trump, egged on by cynical, unprincipled Republicans such as House minority leader Kevin McCarthy and far-right disruptors such as Steve Bannon, has not only not faded from view but, rather, he has emerged, strengthened, as Republican king-maker and his party’s leading 2024 presidential contender. Trump’s bottomless mendacity, lacking any factual, legal or moral basis and flying in the face of numerous court judgments, vote recounts and electoral inquiries, has nevertheless persuaded a majority of Republican voters that Biden was not legitimately elected while seeding doubt in the minds of others. His poison corrodes America’s governing institutions and incites civil strife. Trump embodies a clear and present danger to US national security, stability and democracy. He must be stopped. Biden’s 6 January speech appeared to unleash a new strategy to do just that. Trump, he said, was “holding a dagger” at the throat of American democracy. His “web of lies” could no longer be tolerated. Trump “rallied the mob to attack”, then did nothing to stop the ensuing lethal violence, Biden fumed. The president’s sudden switch to direct confrontation entails obvious dangers. It plays to Trump’s agenda and ego, making him the centre of attention. The shift may also be indicative of political weakness. Biden’s approval ratings are low, his legislative agenda has stalled, the Democrats in Congress are split and the party is widely expected to lose Congress in November’s elections. Yet Biden really had no choice but to go on the offensive. Trump and Trumpism’s world of “alternative facts” has had a free run for too long. To be defeated and debunked, it must be publicly and robustly challenged at every turn. Legal remedies, soft-pedalled until now by the justice department, must be pursued with renewed vigour and determination. “The legal path to investigate the leaders of the coup attempt is clear. The criminal code prohibits inciting an insurrection or ‘giving aid or comfort’ to those who do, as well as conspiracy to forcibly ‘prevent, hinder or delay the execution of any law’,” veteran Harvard constitutional law expert Laurence Tribe wrote recently. It’s a widely held opinion. The many documented actions of Trump and his circle in attempting to overturn the 2020 vote provide numerous grounds for criminal investigation and prosecution. Why is Merrick Garland, the attorney general, still dragging his feet? Biden can righteously rage. But the best antidote to toxic Trump’s dangerously lawless spree, and fears of civil war, is the law itself. Take him down – before it’s too late.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on Joe Biden’s Capitol Hill anniversary speech | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/09/observer-view-joe-biden-capitol-hill-anniversary-speech
1/9/2022,"Many years ago, I met a respected industry insider who knows all there is to know about beauty formulations. We were discussing skin products. Then I asked, “What about eye creams?” She looked straight at me and said, “Eye creams are a complete waste of money.” Up to that point I’d begun to suspect eye creams had a touch of the emperor’s new clothes about them. Hearing her validate my secret thoughts felt like a win. Fast forward to 2022 and here I am recommending eye creams. So what’s changed? Well, we (consumers) have become more discerning and brands realise they can no longer pull the wool over our eyes with overpriced creams that do nothing beyond the realms of a basic moisturiser. Today’s formulations are clever, boundary-pushing stuff. Many include hardworking active ingredients, such as retinol (Sunday Riley, Glow Recipe, Allies of Skin). Many have collagen-boosting properties to plump skin (Shani Darden, Dr Sturm, Clinique). And they go above and beyond to deliver intense hydration and brightening (Rose Inc, Dior, Augustinus Bader, Skinceuticals). So if you are looking to smooth, brighten and rehydrate, these have great stats to back their efficacy. Still, the only thing that gets rid of hereditary dark circles is an excellent concealer. 1.

1/9/2022,"Is democracy in America really on the brink of collapse? A lot of serious people appear to think so. Last week’s first anniversary of the Capitol Hill insurrection, viewed by Democrats as a coup attempt incited by Donald Trump, has sparked a torrent of nervous speculation that it could happen again before, during or after the 2024 presidential election – and that next time, the coup may succeed. One unhappy fact underpins this alarming scenario: many, perhaps most, voters have lost trust in the democratic system that governs them. A majority of Republicans believe Trump’s “big lie” – that Joe Biden stole the 2020 election. Democrats cite elections in 2000 and 2016 when Al Gore and Hillary Clinton respectively won the popular vote but were denied the presidency. Each side accuses the other of fraud and bad faith.  A new USA Today/Suffolk University poll found eight in 10 Republicans, Democrats and independents are worried about the future of American democracy. But they disagree over the causes – and who’s to blame: 85% of Democrats call the Capitol Hill rioters “criminals”; two-thirds of Republicans believe “they went too far but had a point”. “Only free and fair elections in which the loser abides by the result stand between each of us and life at the mercy of a despotic regime,” warns Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe. But increasingly, for today’s politicians, honourable defeat is a wholly foreign concept. This chronic loss of institutional trust and credibility, also tainting a politicised, conservative-dominated supreme court, reflects a society more openly riven by longstanding cultural, racial and religious animosities – and one in which income, wealth and health inequalities are growing. These divisions are in turn wilfully exacerbated by rightwing broadcast and online media, bloggers and internet trolls. A Republican party mostly in thrall to Trump’s lies, delusions and conspiracy theories is creating a world of “alternative facts”, says columnist Thomas Friedman. If they succeed in replacing truth, “America isn’t just in trouble. It is headed for what scientists call ‘an extinction-level event’”. Jedediah Britton-Purdy, a Columbia law professor, is similarly apocalyptic. “One thing Democrats and Republicans share is the belief that, to save the country, the other side must not be allowed to win … Every election is an existential crisis,” he wrote. “We should stop underestimating the threat facing the country,” a grim New York Times editorial thundered last week. “January 6 is not in the past; it is every day. It is regular citizens who threaten election officials, who ask ‘when can we use the guns?’, who vow to murder politicians who dare to vote their conscience. It is Republican lawmakers scrambling to make it harder for people to vote and subvert their will if they do. It is Trump who stokes the flames of conflict.” Democracy, it said, was in “grave danger”. Systemic violence that overwhelms conventional politics may be near at hand. “We are closer to civil war than any of us would like to believe,” says Barbara Walter, a California politics professor. No one is talking about a remake of the 1861-65 US civil war. Instead, as in Ukraine or Libya, an “open insurgency”, as defined by Walter, would probably involve (at least initially), disparate militias and their supporters pursuing forms of asymmetrical warfare – typically terrorist acts, bombings, assassinations, kidnappings. That said, worrying echoes of Confederate-era secessionism are once again heard in Texas and elsewhere. When the warlike rhetoric of Charlottesville-style paramilitary white supremacists, the high nationwide incidence of gun ownership and, for example, worries about far-right cells within the US military are factored in, civil war scenarios do not appear so implausible. “Only a spark is needed, one major domestic terrorist event that shifts the perception of the country,” analyst Stephen Marche wrote last week. Marche quotes a military history professor and Iraq war veteran, Col Peter Mansoor, who tells him: “It would not be like the first civil war, with armies manoeuvring on the battlefield. I think it would very much be a free-for-all, neighbour on neighbour, based on beliefs and skin colours and religion. And it would be horrific.” So what is to be done? Columbia’s Britton-Purdy says America’s democracy is failing because it is not democratic enough. Old saws about the “tyranny of the majority”, propagated by founding father James Madison, among others, are redundant. The electoral college, which can override the popular vote, should be abolished, the franchise widened, and constitutional amendments curbing money in politics, banning gerrymandering and enshrining abortion rights should be voted on by all, he argued. Cynthia Miller-Idriss, author of Hate in the Homeland, says a key problem is the “mainstreaming of far-right extremism” during Trump’s presidency. She advocates large-scale investment to strengthen communities and improve media literacy and civic education. Friedman wants corporate America to cut off funding to Trump and anti-democratic Republicans. “Civil war is bad for business,” he wrote. Just look at Lebanon. Senator Bernie Sanders says radical change is the only answer. “At a time when the demagogues want to divide us … we must build an unstoppable grassroots movement that helps create the kind of nation we know we can become,” he says. Yet many Americans, including moderate Democrats, find the progressive left’s “transformational” agenda deeply disturbing, exemplified by calls to defund the police. Harvard’s Laurence Tribe and fellow lawyers say that for democracy and the rule of law to survive, there must be accountability. That requires, in addition to the congressional inquiry, “a robust criminal investigation” into all those responsible for 6 January – including Trump. In a tougher than usual speech marking the anniversary, Biden condemned “the former president’s web of lies” – but gave no hint of legal or other action to punish or restrain him. What would Alexis de Tocqueville, author of the famous study, Democracy in America, make of the present-day US? The French aristocrat and political scientist travelled the country in 1831-2, talking to ordinary people about governance and citizenship. He concluded, broadly, that democracy was an unstoppable, levelling historical trend that would eventually conquer the world. Until relatively recently, many in the west still held to that view. Now, with the rise of China and other powerful authoritarian, anti-democratic regimes, optimism is fading – and America, the global paradigm, is itself under the reactionary hammer. Has De Tocqueville’s dream been exploded? Not yet. The epic struggle for America’s democratic soul is just getting started. For a watching world, the stakes are sky-high, too. Where would Britain, Europe and all the globe’s democracies, actual and aspiring, be without the flawed but inspiring US example, without the “arsenal of democracy” to justify, validate and fortify their political universe? Best ask Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and other despots. They are betting the ranch on the failure of American democracy – and aim to profit greatly thereby.",Opinion/Opinion,The epic struggle for America’s soul is just getting started,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/09/the-epic-struggle-for-americas-soul-is-just-getting-started
1/9/2022,"There is a plaque in the Old Bailey that commemorates the “courage and endurance” of Edward Bushell and 11 other jurors. In 1670, they were locked up by a judge without food and water for two days because they refused to change their not guilty verdict in the case of two Quakers who had been charged with unlawful assembly. Bushell petitioned the courts and the chief justice at the time, Sir John Vaughan, ruled that a jury could not be punished on account of the verdict it returned. In doing so, he established in English law the essential principle of jury independence. That principle means there is no such thing as an “incorrect” jury acquittal: juries have an absolute right to acquit a defendant in a criminal trial regardless of the legal arguments advanced in a case. Yet in the case of the not guilty verdict returned by the jury in the Colston four case, senior Conservative politicians, including the attorney general, the principal legal adviser to the Crown and the head of the Bar in England and Wales, have weighed in with explicit or implied criticism of the verdict, a fundamental undermining of the rule of law.  The Colston four were charged with criminal damage for their role in toppling the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol in 2020. Colston made his fortune by trafficking 80,000 men, women and children from Africa to America in the 17th century; one in five died in dreadful conditions en route. Bristol residents have, to little avail, long petitioned for their city to revisit the grossly offensive way he is honoured, including through this statue, which made no mention of his terrible legacy. The defendants’ acquittal by a jury should be the last word in this case. There were four potential defences put forward by lawyers for the four protesters; even if the jury found none convincing, they were still within their right to return a verdict of not guilty. But Tory politicians, including the prime minister and the home secretary, have picked a culture war with anti-racism protesters and well before the trial made their opinions on the toppling of the veneration of a slave trader well known. Since the verdict, they have not been able to resist implicitly expressing opinions on the lawfulness of its actions, thus undermining the rule of law. Robert Jenrick, the former communities secretary, suggested that the jury verdict itself undermined the rule of law, thus committing the very deed he wrongly accuses them of. Robert Buckland, the former justice secretary, himself a lawyer, called the verdict “perverse”. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the government would fix the “loopholes in the law” that allowed for the jury verdict, without specifying what he meant, and indeed, whether he was questioning the very principle of jury independence established in 1670. By far the worst intervention, however, came from the attorney general, Suella Braverman, who announced via social media that, while trial by jury is an important right, the Colston verdict is causing confusion and so she is considering referring it to the court of appeal to clarify the law. A referral to the court of appeal is within her rights as attorney general and, as she stated, the court of appeal cannot overturn the jury verdict. However, there is absolutely no justification for her announcing that she is considering seeking a clarification on the law, without also setting out exactly what point of law in the judge’s directions to the jury, or in the court proceedings, is unclear. This is a gross politicisation and serves no purpose other than allowing her to inappropriately express a view on the jury’s verdict. Braverman’s announcement is only the latest sign of a Tory government only too willing to trash the rule of law for its own political ends. The examples abound, most memorably, Boris Johnson’s attempted prorogation of parliament in July 2019, ruled unlawful by the supreme court. Johnson said he disagreed with the supreme court, a nonsensical position given the highest court in the land does not opine on the law, it states how the law applies. Another cabinet minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg, accused the supreme court of a “constitutional coup”. But there are others. In 2016, Liz Truss while lord chancellor failed to defend the independent judiciary against dangerously hostile attacks from the press. In November 2020, the Home Office released a video that attacked “activist lawyers” for representing clients against the state, a role without which the justice system would not deserve its name. The government introduced the internal market bill in late 2020, which ministers readily conceded broke international law. And in recent years there have been repeated political attacks on judicial review – a vital route through which citizens can challenge the lawfulness of government actions – that give the impression of a government that wants to avoid all consequences of acting unlawfully. This rubbishes the core principle that the law applies equally to us all, including those involved in making it. The uncodified British constitution means that we as citizens rely on our politicians to abide by an unwritten honour code: that they will act to uphold the rule of law and respect the seven principles of public life. There may be advantages to a flexible constitution, but it is vulnerable to battering by a populist government such as Johnson’s. He is a prime minister with little regard for standards in public life or the rule of law. The damage Johnson is doing to fundamental constitutional principles that have evolved over centuries to protect citizens from the unlawful excesses of the state will last long after he leaves office.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on Tories’ questioning of Colston verdict | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/09/observer-view-tories-questioning-colston-verdict
