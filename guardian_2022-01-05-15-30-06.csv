1/5/2022,"Good morning, I’m Virginia Harrison and here is what’s making news this Wednesday morning.  Care operators are facing acute staffing shortages caused by the Omicron variant with more than 90 declaring a “red alert”, meaning staffing ratios have been breached. More than 11,000 care home workers are off for Covid reasons, according to internal health system staffing data seen by the Guardian. Government data shows that 9.4% of care home staff are off work across England, with close to 3% absent because of Covid. The figures, which may be an underestimate because of the festive break, are drawn from submissions by thousands of care providers. The worst-affected areas appear to be in the north-east, north-west and parts of London. As Robert Booth reports, many care operators say delays in getting PCR test results back were a key frustration, meaning workers who may not be infected were isolating longer than necessary. The extent of the strain in care homes comes as Boris Johnson admitted for the first time that parts of the NHS may be overwhelmed in the coming weeks and insisted England can “ride out” its biggest ever Covid wave “without shutting down our country once again”. With frontline worker absences fuelled by a record 218,000 new confirmed UK cases of Covid on Tuesday, Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical adviser, said the NHS faced “very substantial pressure over the next couple of weeks” – though there was not yet a “surge in mortality” seen with other waves by this stage.

No 10 party pooper – The new head of an investigation into alleged rule-breaking Downing Street parties has not “started from scratch” and is unlikely to re-interview all government staff who have already been spoken to about their knowledge of the gatherings, the Guardian has been told. Sources said that Sue Gray, who took over the probe after cabinet secretary Simon Case recused himself when a Christmas event in his own office was revealed, would more likely “pick up” the existing work and look for “holes” in the testimony provided so far. Gray’s attention will also have to turn to more gatherings that have come to light since the initial probe led by Case began, including an event revealed by the Guardian attended by Johnson, his wife and 17 others. Gray’s inquiry is expected to take several more weeks and will be made public. Here’s Aubrey Allegretti’s full report. Mail to pay Meghan £1 – The Mail on Sunday will pay the Duchess of Sussex just £1 in damages for invading her privacy by publishing a private letter she had sent to her father. The nominal sum is set out in court documents that also formally confirm that the newspaper – and its sister website MailOnline – has accepted defeat and will not be taking the long-running case to a supreme court appeal. The outlet will also pay an unspecified sum for the separate case of infringing Meghan’s copyright by publishing large chunks of the letter. The duchess had always said that her three-year legal battle against Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, was more about principles than money. Early cancer detection hopes – Scientists have developed a blood test that could help detect cancer in people with nonspecific symptoms such as unexplained weight loss or fatigue. If validated, the test could enable cancer patients to be identified earlier, when they are more likely to respond to treatment, and help flag up who could benefit from early access to drugs designed to tackle metastatic cancer. There is currently no clear route through which someone with nonspecific symptoms that could be cancer is referred for further investigation. Read more here. Sicilian mystery unravelled – The 200-year-old secrets of the child mummies of the Capuchin Catacombs of Palermo in northern Sicily are to be revealed by a British-led team of scientists using X-ray technology. Dr Kirsty Squires, of Staffordshire University, will head a first attempt to tell the stories of some of the 163 children whose remains lie within the corridors and crypts of the famous underground tomb. The catacombs contain 1,284 mummified and skeletonised bodies, the largest collection of mummies in Europe. While many of the children contained there are now skeletal, others have been described as appearing as if they are sleeping. The two-year investigation will focus on the children who died between 1787 and 1880 and, initially, on 41 bodies residing within a bespoke “child chapel”. The year has begun with warnings of critical incidents in UK hospitals and fears over school reopenings but there are reasons to be optimistic, says science correspondent Nicola Davis.

Thomas Tuchel will fine Romelu Lukaku despite accepting the striker’s apology for a controversial interview and has said he faced no opposition from Chelsea’s board after dropping the club’s record signing against Liverpool. There was a fierce backlash to the news World No 1 Novak Djokovic has been granted a medical exemption to compete in the Australian Open without being vaccinated against Covid-19. All Australian Open participants must either be fully vaccinated or apply for and secure an exemption in order to enter Victoria without undertaking the mandatory 14-day quarantine. Public reaction to the news of Djokovic’s exemption was overwhelmingly hostile. Among those speaking out was Stephen Parnis, a former vice-president of the Australian Medical Association, who described the decision as appalling. “I don’t care how good a tennis player he is. If he’s refusing to get vaccinated, he shouldn’t be allowed in,” Parnis tweeted. Meanwhile, Nick Kyrgios will arrive in Sydney later this week with a lowly rankings status he has not borne since his stunning breakout performance at Wimbledon back in 2014. Japan’s Sony Group will establish a new company for electric vehicles this spring, its chairman said at the CES technology conference in the US, becoming the latest tech company to beef up its ambitions in the fast-growing market.

1/5/2022,"Strict lockdowns in the Chinese cities of Xi’an and Yuzhou are taking their toll on the population and healthcare systems, according to residents, with complaints of food shortages and dangerous delays in accessing medical care. Xi’an, a city of 13 million people, has been under a strict lockdown for nearly two weeks, while Yuzhou’s 1.2 million residents have been ordered to stay inside since Monday evening, after three asymptomatic cases were discovered. Public transport, the use of private motor vehicles, and operation of all shops and venues not supplying daily necessities have all been suspended.  On China’s strictly monitored and regulated social media platforms, a significant number of residents have posted about their concerns and anxieties, despite generally broad support for authorities’ swift response to outbreaks. Local media has reported concerning delays in the cities’ major hospitals, which require negative tests from patients before they can be admitted. A screenshot of one post which went viral before being deleted claimed a man and his sick father were turned away from a Xi’an hospital because they were from an area designated as higher risk. The post said the man’s father was having a heart attack but died by the time he was admitted for treatment. In another account posted to social media, a woman in labour lost her baby after she was prevented from entering a Xi’an hospital. In a since-deleted post, a relative described calling emergency services on the night of 1 January for their aunt after she started feeling pain, but the phone rang out. Instead they sent her to hospital at around 8pm but “the front door security wouldn’t let us in, because the nucleic acid test result had been more than four hours ago”, they said. “While she was waiting outside, I saw the video her husband sent me, she was holding the chair, struggling to sit on it, and her blood streamed down the chair and her pants.” They said hospital staff saw and brought her inside and to the operating room, but the child died. A spokeswoman for the state-linked Shaanxi women’s federation, said they had talked to authorities about the incident. “They should be learning about the incident now. Because the epidemic in Xi’an is quite serious now, there definitely should be a solution.” Reports of food shortages in Xi’an have also flourished on social media despite promises by authorities to deliver supplies to homes, and claims of neighbours bartering cigarettes and personal belongings for food. “I have only received free vegetables once so far, and one package per household,” said one resident. “The price of food in the city is very high, and there is no one to regulate it. There is no take-away service for daily necessities, and the errand fee is about 100 yuan ($15) before someone takes the order.” The strict rules have also prevented people from coming and going. Sixth Tone reported authorities had arrested several people trying to evade the blockades and return to villages without quarantining, including a man who cycled 100km (60 miles) through mountains, and another who swam across an icy river. Authorities have conceded there have been issues, including poorly prepared centralised quarantine facilities where tens of thousands of people have been sent. Local officials are often punished or fired for alleged failures in outbreak prevention, including two senior Communist party officials in Xi’an who were removed from their posts over their “insufficient rigour in preventing and controlling the outbreak”. On Monday, Xi’an officials said the city had spent about $1m on assisting people in need, and had housed about 200 stranded people in temporary shelters. They also promised to set up hotlines and further assistance services. Xi’an is the centre of the current outbreak, China’s worst since the early months of the pandemic. More than 1,700 cases have been recorded in the city since early December – a relatively low number compared with global figures as China continues to implement the zero-Covid strategy which has kept infections at low levels for much of the past 18 months. With the Olympics around the corner and a central government commitment vowing to stamp out the virus, local officials have enacted increasingly strict responses, resulting in lockdowns reminiscent of Wuhan’s in early 2020. Other urban hubs where clusters have been detected now also face restrictions including a new partial lockdown in the city of Zhengzhou over the discovery of four cases. On Tuesday, China reported 41 new symptomatic community cases, including 35 in Xi’an. On Wednesday, officials said the city’s outbreak had been largely “brought under control” after the lockdown. Ma Guanghui, deputy director of Shaanxi health commission, told a press conference the outbreak was “showing a downward trend”.

1/5/2022,"Towards the end of last year, as thoughts shifted to the season ahead, and players considered their participation at Melbourne Park, Novak Djokovic gave an interview to Serbian publication Blic. He described questions about his vaccination status as “inappropriate” and he bemoaned the role of the media. He was pointedly direct: “Your editors can take what I have just said and turn it into a scandal,” he said. “I do not want to be a part of that storm.”  During the first week of the Australian tennis summer the storm arrived when Djokovic announced on social media that he had received an “exemption permission” to travel to Australia without being vaccinated. Over the past few months, the vaccination requirements for players wishing to compete at the Australian Open left a profound mark on the professional tours. Uptake of Covid vaccines in tennis had been extremely slow, but once the Victoria state government rules were confirmed, the rate of vaccination rose (the ATP has said that 95% of its top 100 players have been vaccinated). It only made the world No 1’s unresolved status more conspicuous and newsworthy. In a sense, Djokovic’s announcement is at least a welcome end to such constant speculation. But once he arrives in Melbourne, he will be asked repeatedly to explain how, of all people, the world’s best tennis player was able to gain an exemption? How much information is shared about the application will be entirely his choice. While Djokovic never explicitly revealed his vaccination status, he has offered numerous indications of his general stance. Long before vaccines were available, he stated his concern about having to be vaccinated in order to travel. He has often stressed the importance of embracing “natural” solutions; early in the pandemic he held Instagram live conversations in which he spoke of how the power of gratitude could “turn the most toxic food, or maybe most polluted water into the most healing water.” After he underwent surgery on his right elbow in 2018, a procedure that has allowed him to win nine grand slam titles since, he said that he cried for three days. His belief in alternative medicine is complemented by his commitment to alternative history. He frequently retreats to hills in Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he meets up with the businessman Semir Osmanagic – whose claims that there are ancient man-made structures with magical healing powers, refuted by scientists, have turned the hills into a lucrative tourist destination. Djokovic has also expressed his support for the ultranationalist alternative historian Jovan Deretic, whose writings claim, among other things, that numerous European cultures, including ancient Greeks, Celts and Etruscans, are descended from Serbs. Djokovic is unyielding in his commitment to his beliefs away from the court, however questionable they are, and that single-mindedness is also visible in his faith in the methods that have led to his on-court success. Since the criteria for the Australian Open became clear, it always appeared that Djokovic intended to find a way to compete at the tournament and continue his push for history at a critical moment for tennis, but only without compromising those beliefs. Something he appears to have achieved. Last year, one of the defining images of the chaotic Australian Open was the continued presence of tournament director Craig Tiley on television as he managed the sudden lockdown that prevented crowds attending much of the tournament. After Djokovic’s announcement, Tiley returned to a similar role on Wednesday as he stressed that there has been no favourable treatment for Djokovic and reinforced the strength of the medical exemption process. The exemption applications were reviewed by two independent panels of experts, one assembled by Tennis Australia and another by the Victorian government, which Tiley describes as a more rigorous process than for regular citizens. On Wednesday another potential obstacle to his participation emerged, when Australia’s home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, said it was the federal government that would “enforce our requirements at the Australian border”, whatever Tennis Australia and the Victorian government might have decided about a non-vaccinated player taking part in the tournament. It’s unclear what response Djokovic will receive on arrival. He is popular with a considerable group of players due to the concern he has expressed for the lower-ranked members of the ATP Tour but, as the world No 1, he is simultaneously a clear beneficiary of the privileges afforded to top players. The cynicism that some have was reflected in comments from Jamie Murray, who suggested he does not believe that he would have received an exemption, and Alex de Minaur who subtly described the subject as “interesting” and hoped that other applicants received the same treatment. On social media, reaction to Djokovic’s statement from the Australian public was overwhelmingly hostile, and many called for fans to boo him if he appeared in Melbourne. Djokovic is the most successful singles player at the Australian Open in the Open era and he will chase a 10th title here this year. He has garnered such success in a country with a large population of Serb origin, who have exuberantly supported him throughout. But last year, his attempts to secure better quarantine conditions for players lacked tact and turned many against him. This year, there is widespread anxiety in the community as the virus once again takes hold and basic tools like rapid antigen tests are difficult to attain. As Djokovic waltzes into the country, exempt from rules that most have adhered to, more storms are to come.",Sport/Sport,Novak Djokovic flies into Australian Open vaccination storm | Tumaini Carayol,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/05/novak-djokovic-flies-into-australian-open-vaccination-storm
1/5/2022,"It is clear from the opening minutes of The Lost Daughter, Maggie Gyllenhaal’s melancholic, bristly directorial debut on Netflix, that a dark secret stalks the sunny Mediterranean vacation of Leda Caruso, (a luminous Olivia Colman), a 48-year-old English professor of comparative literature. Her “working holiday” at a Greek island is immediately beset by increasingly ominous intrusions: a spectral foghorn, a bowl of rotting fruit, a shrill cicada, a boisterous Italian American family from Queens who disrupt her beachside reading. Memories pull at her focus; when the young daughter of Nina (Dakota Johnson), a beautiful, languid member of the Queens bunch who immediately catches Leda’s attention, goes briefly missing, Nina’s panic elides with a flashback to twentysomething Leda’s (Jessie Buckley) frantic search for her daughter Bianca at a beach.  It’s a familiar language of buried secrets, sinister subtext and unspooling memories – the building blocks of suspense – but the landmines in The Lost Daughter aren’t the usual culprits of dark revelation: unspeakable trauma or abuse, evil spirits, suppressed desires, the ravages of capitalism or greed. Instead, the molten core of The Lost Daughter is one of our culture’s most enduring and least touchable taboos: the selfish, uncaring, “unnatural” mother – one who doesn’t shift easily to care-taking, who does not relish her role, who not only begrudges but resents her children. The Lost Daughter, adapted (and anglicized) from the short novel of the same name by Elena Ferrante, is a masterclass in imbuing ostensibly low stakes with spellbinding tension. The book is written entirely in Leda’s internal monologue, which Gyllenhaal, aided by Colman and Buckley’s fluid performances, conveys through taut dialogue and flashback sequences. The action is relatively mundane – Leda goes to the beach, eats dinner alone, and observes an exhausted Nina fielding the demands of her restless daughter Elena, who is lost for all of a few minutes. The most significant transgression is Leda’s impulsive and childish theft of Elena’s beloved doll. The film’s climactic reveal is not an act of abuse or searing trauma, as the prevalence of the trauma plot in film, TV and literature has taught us to expect, but an absence: for three years, Leda, desperate for reprieve and recognition, forfeited her role as mother, and left her daughters with her husband (Jack Farthing). The stakes of The Lost Daughter feel so weighty, the viewing experience so unsettling and transgressive, because the myth Leda’s recollections deftly unravel – that motherhood will come to women naturally, that it will give something without taking something irreparable and valuable away – is so deeply woven into our culture as to be almost invisible. It is everywhere and nowhere, the idea of motherhood as an identity of tenderness, sacrifice, fulfillment and, above all, selflessness. It’s in commonly heard descriptions of motherhood as “my life completely changed”; “I became a different person”; “I found my purpose”; “I met myself”. (Which may be true for some people!) It shapes the image of mom-fluencers and so-called mommy blogs, informs the constant pressure for mothers to optimize every facet of their child’s life, and underpins the norms that, in the US, justify women as the de facto social safety net. The Lost Daughter, as in several of Ferrante’s other works (fans will note themes further explored in her bestselling Neapolitan novels), dares to posit that for some, motherhood might not actualize the self but plunder it, especially if, like Leda, she becomes one while still barely an adult herself (doing the math, Leda was 23 when she had her first child, 25 for her second). Leda’s ambivalence toward motherhood – magnetic, vulgar, revelatory, repulsive – is a posture still rarely explored on screen. There are anti-mothering villains in films and television (Psycho, Carrie, the horror films Hereditary and The Lodge) but few examples of women who struggle with the expectations of the role in good faith, fewer still those who reject it. Crucially, The Lost Daughter is not a portrait of regret, for either having children or leaving them. Leda never says the word, nor does she appear to feel in isolation from other emotions such as guilt, anguish, pride, love. Gyllenhaal takes pains to portray Leda as anything but an uncaring person. She comforts Nina, meets her confessions with serrated vulnerability, offers up her apartment as a hideaway for the young mother’s nascent affair. She glows reminiscing about her 20s over dinner, comforts a frightened, lost Elena on the beach. In flashback sequences, Leda can be withholding, vindictive, unreasonable with her daughters; she is also doting, curious, radiant, expressive as she teaches her children to read, to play, or just holds them. Watching the scenes of her failures and abandonment – rebuffing her daughters, lashing out at them, leaving them – is an uncomfortable experience. Self-absorption is often indistinguishable from self-preservation, and neither are pretty. I resent Leda for ignoring her children, and I can imagine the language through which they’ll later describe their abandonment, perhaps estrangement. (For what it’s worth, I write this as a 28-year-old woman both drawn to and terrified by the prospect of having kids.) But Gyllenhaal’s unwavering focus on Leda’s battered interiority, and Colman and Buckley’s equal expressiveness, refuse to allow you to condemn her. Leda is a woman under siege – in the past, from the constant barrages of motherhood upon her body, sleep, time, academic career, her identity, sexiness, professional opportunities. She has no outlet for herself, no recourse for the pressure and little help from her clueless husband. In the present, from the memories of exhaustion, the hauntings of failure, the ghosts of condemnation. Motherhood, she delicately tells a pregnant member of the Queens family, is “a crushing responsibility”. The Lost Daughter sits with a woman who escaped its suffocation, however temporarily; the women who experience it disjointedly, and for whom there is no peace.

1/5/2022,"Flooding over the past 14 years has caused major disruption to towns and cities, schools, hospitals and care homes, a study reveals. The analysis shows towns and cities have been hit by flash flooding 51 times. Fifteen hospitals and 68 schools have also suffered from rising flood waters, which have caused major disruption to patients and to children.  The analysis, carried out by the Conservative-leaning thinktank Bright Blue, says that with increased flooding due to the climate emergency, the government must do more to improve the resilience of communities, businesses, and other infrastructure. Using a form of artificial intelligence called Natural Language Processing (NLP), the data was collected by analysing archives of thousands of local, regional and national newspapers. The report comes after the devastation caused by Storm Arwen last October, when members of the public were left without power for more than a week. Storm Arwen was one of the worst in a generation. Electricity poles snapped and wires came down across large swathes of the country. The north-east of England, the Wye Valley, the Lake District, Aberdeenshire and Perthshire were among some of the worst-hit areas. The analysis shows that the impact on essential services such as power, which was dramatically highlighted by Arwen, is a threat linked to flooding for the last 14 years and will continue to be to in future as climate impacts increase extreme weather events. Since 2007, according to the analysis, there have been at least 12 instances of flooded electricity substations, in at least one case leading to power cuts that were problematic for emergency response and community resilience, and at least five instances of damage to gas pipelines due to the bridges supporting them collapsing. Working with the NGO ClimateNode, the authors produced the data in an interactive map of storm impacts. Bright Blue said the analysis revealed that the UK was not adequately prepared for the increasing risk posed by flooding as the climate changes. Particular areas of concern are: Urban drainage: heavy rainfall puts drainage and sewerage infrastructure under strain, even exceeding their limits, and contributing to flooding in some cases. Hospitals: at least 15 experienced flooding causing disruption or imminent risk of disruption to patient services or hospital support services, Schools: a least 68 schools have suffered sufficient water entering buildings to disrupt lessons, or school transport; 22 suffered at least significant damage and seven severe damage and Care homes: nine care homes and four retirement complexes have been flooded. Major disruptions to social care included carers unable to reach elderly people in rural areas; loss of power, hot water and heating in care homes. Helen Jackson, associate fellow at Bright Blue and the report’s author, said: “The disruption caused by Storm Arwen highlights the need to make our infrastructure resilient to extreme weather, and be more preventive and less reactive. “Many towns and cities in the UK are seeing repeat episodes of flash flooding affecting households, businesses, and transport systems. We need to recognise this trend and do much more to ensure our urban drainage and sewer systems can cope with heavy rainfall as the climate changes. This should include limiting the spread of impermeable surfaces in our cities and ensuring basic measures like drain cleaning are not overlooked.” The report called for the government to support and fund an ongoing programme of research to identify and monitor risks associated with extreme rainfall in urban areas. It also said government should conduct a civil resilience exercise for an extreme rainfall event in a major UK urban area, incorporating significant infrastructure failure. Ryan Shorthouse, the chief executive of Bright Blue, said: “Flooding is one of the most serious climate-related challenges that this country is facing and will continue to face as the climate changes further in the coming years. “The impact of flooding is already being felt deeply in communities across the UK. The UK government can and must do much more to better improve the resilience of local communities, businesses, public services, and critical infrastructure to flooding.”",News/Environment,UK towns and cities hit by flash flooding 51 times since 2007,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/05/uk-towns-and-cities-hit-by-flash-flooding-51-times-since-2007
1/5/2022,"The dean of the University of Pennsylvania’s law school has condemned one of his school’s own professors for making racist remarks about Asians, saying that their recent comments were “xenophobic and white supremacist”. Professor Amy Wax, who specializes in social welfare law and labor and family economics law, appeared as a guest on economist Glenn Loury’s podcast when she called the influx of “Asian elites” into the United States problematic and made other racist statements, including a call for less immigration from Asian countries.  In a scathing response, Dean Theodore Ruger acknowledged that while Wax’s comments were protected by freedom of speech and she held tenure at the college, they were “diametrically opposed to the policies and ethos of this institution”. “They serve as a persistent and tangible reminder that racism, sexism and xenophobia are not theoretical abstractions but are real and insidious beliefs in this country and in our building,” Ruger said of Wax’s comments. In the podcast Wax asserted that most Asian Americans are Democrats and questioned whether or not “the spirit of liberty beat in their breast”. “As long as most Asians support Democrats and help to advance their positions, I think the United States is better off with fewer Asians and less Asian immigration,” Wax said. She went on to criticize diversity and inclusion initiatives and said immigrants should be “abjectly grateful” rather than critical of the United States. Of diversity as a general concept, Wax said she was not convinced there were no downsides. Wax has come under fire before for previous arguments she made at the National Conservatism Conference in 2019 for “cultural distance” or “taking the position that our country will be better off with more whites and fewer non-whites”. In 2017, Penn law school alumni petitioned Ruger to take action against Wax for inaccurate statements that Black students didn’t graduate at the top quarter of their class and rarely graduated in the top half. Despite the condemnation, Wax maintains her employment at the university.

1/5/2022,"The wife of an Ohio man fatally shot by police minutes into the new year has said he had been firing an assault-style rifle to celebrate the arrival of 2022 when an officer opened fire without warning. Marquetta Williams told the Repository newspaper her 46-year-old husband, James, was using an AR-15 rifle that belonged to her to fire celebratory shots early on Saturday outside their home in Canton.  That night, James, a stay-at-home father or stepfather of six girls, was at home with his wife, three of their daughters and two other family members. Marquetta Williams said the gunfire was an annual tradition in their neighborhood, with many neighbors also firing shots. She also said James was behind a 6ft fence, adding: “You can’t see in. You can’t see out.” James Williams came back inside the house, his wife said, then decided to go back outside and shoot some more. His wife said he fired four shots into the air and turned to follow her inside, then told her: “I’ve been shot.” “I could see the blood splattering across his shirt,” Marquetta Williams said. “He collapsed in the living room.” Referring to the police officer who shot him, she said: “His life was in danger, because you didn’t announce yourself. That’s cold-blooded and I’m not going to rest until he does get justice, period.” Marquetta Williams called 911. When she opened her door, she said, “There were 30-something officers with guns pointing at us, telling us to get down and come out of the house with our hands up.” She told Cleveland 19 News protests and a vigil were planned. In a statement, the Canton police chief, Jack Angelo, said officers were investigating reports of gunfire when an officer who was outside his vehicle confronted someone who began shooting a firearm. Angelo said the officer feared for his safety and fired his duty weapon at the person, striking him. The department has declined further comment. Marquetta Williams said no officers identified themselves before the shooting occurred around 12.05am. James Williams was taken to a hospital but was pronounced dead a short time later. “Out of the blue, he said he got shot, he got hit,” she said. “I don’t know where it came from. Nobody said anything. They didn’t say, ‘Police.’ They didn’t say, ‘Freeze.’ They didn’t say, ‘Drop your weapon.’ They just shot him.” The Ohio bureau of criminal investigation was investigating and all evidence including body-camera images and firearms had been turned over to the agency, police said. The officer involved was placed on administrative duty, standard procedure in shootings involving police. His name was not immediately released.

1/5/2022,"Care operators are facing acute staffing shortages caused by Omicron with more than 90 declaring a “red” alert, which means staffing ratios have been breached. Over 11,000 care home workers are off for Covid reasons, according to internal health system staffing data seen by the Guardian. One of the UK’s largest private operators, Barchester, is dealing with outbreaks in 105 of its 250 homes. It said that rules meaning homes with Covid cannot accept hospital discharges will cause backlogs in the already struggling NHS.  Across England, 9.4% of care home staff are off work, according to government live data, with close to 3% absent because of Covid. The figures, which may be an underestimate because of the festive break, are drawn from submissions by thousands of care providers. The worst affected areas appear to be in the north-east, north-west and parts of London, where combined Covid and non-Covid absence rates ranged from 16% to 22%. Experts said care standards could suffer as absences rose and councils were braced to redeploy staff from services such as libraries to help backfill threadbare rotas. “The spread of Omicron across the country will bring more care homes into outbreak, put huge pressure on the already compromised staff group and mean those who need care do not get it,” said Vic Rayner, chief executive of the National Care Forum. Many care operators said delays in getting PCR test results back were a key frustration, meaning workers who may not be infected were isolating longer than necessary. At one Barchester home in Shrewsbury 17 staff are off and 22 residents have tested positive while at a home in east London 27 staff are off and 20 residents have tested positive. HC-One, the UK’s largest private care home provider, said 869 staff are off with Covid or awaiting results – close to 5% of the workforce. However, the virus is not causing widespread serious illness and death among residents, with 10 fatalities involving Covid in recent weeks across the chain, according to Pete Calveley, chief executive of Barchester, who said many residents “have only minor or cold-like symptoms”. But up to 15% of staff are off work at the chain’s worst affected homes and the struggle to find replacements has seen care agencies quoting £80 an hour for staff – quadruple the normal rate – and a new practice of “gazumping”, with homes losing already booked staff at the last minute to operators willing to pay more. Mike Padgham, a care operator in Yorkshire, on Tuesday urged the health secretary, Sajid Javid, urgently to establish a “volunteer army” of retired nurses, doctors, and carers who could fill shifts. In Wales, Mario Kreft, chair of Care Forum Wales, described the situation as “hugely serious”, with large groups of staff testing positive after the Christmas break. He said that in the worst cases operators have had three-quarters of their staff off. Eight staff at one of his homes in north Wales reported positive tests on Tuesday morning. “It’s a war footing,” he said. “We are trying to get everyone to the frontline and it is very, very difficult. We are appealing for understanding.” Stephen Chandler, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said councils were braced for calls for help from care operators and said “the care that people experience will be affected”. In his county, Oxfordshire, a call has gone out for help from volunteers who work in libraries and at heritage sites. Sanjiv Joshi, who runs 14 care homes in south Wales, said in one home over Christmas there were only half the staff needed to cover shifts, meaning that new recruits going through training had to be hurried into frontline roles. “We are 20% down [on staff],” he said. “I know of other providers who say they are 30% to 50% down. Our biggest worry is the infection rates are so high it’s not going to spare anyone. We need an effective lockdown or control measures so that we don’t let the infections spiral out of control.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Protecting care staff and people who use social care services continues to be a priority, especially as cases surge and Omicron spreads rapidly across the country. “Throughout the pandemic, we have made almost £2.4bn in specific funding available for adult social care and this week we announced an extra £60m to keep people in care homes safe over January.’’",News/Society,More than 90 care home operators in England declare red alert over staffing,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/05/90-care-home-operators-in-england-declare-red-alert-over-staffing-covid
1/5/2022,"Charles Darwin created the most successful theory in the history of biology: the theory of evolution. He was also responsible for another grand theory: the theory of emotion, which dominated his field for more than a century. That theory was dead wrong. The most important tenet of his theory was that the mind consists of two competing forces, the rational and the emotional. He believed emotions played a constructive role in the lives of non-human animals, but in humans emotions were a vestige whose usefulness had been largely superseded by the evolution of reason.  We now know that, on the contrary, emotions enhance our process of reasoning and aid our decision-making. In fact, we can’t make decisions, or even think, without being influenced by our emotions. Consider a pioneering 2010 study in which researchers analysed the work of 118 professional traders in stocks, bonds and derivatives at four investment banks. Some were highly successful, but many were not. The researchers’ goal was to understand what differentiated the two groups. Their conclusion? They had different attitudes toward the role of emotion in their job. The relatively less successful traders for the most part denied that emotion played a significant role. They tried to suppress their emotions, while at the same time denying that emotions had an effect on their decision-making. The most successful traders, in contrast, had a different attitude. They showed a great willingness to reflect on their emotion-driven behaviour. They recognised that emotion and good decision-making were inextricably linked. Accepting that emotions were necessary for high performance, they “tended to reflect critically about the origin of their intuitions and the role of emotion”. Though the successful traders embraced the positive and essential role emotions played, they understood that when emotions become too intense it is useful to know how to tone them down. The issue for them was not how to avoid emotion, but how to regulate and harness it. Today, it has become common for hedge funds and financial firms to employ “psychology coaches” to meet traders on a one-on-one basis, as portrayed in the television series Billions. If emotions aid rational reasoning, how does that work? Perhaps the most important discovery regarding the role of emotion is that even when you believe you are exercising cold, logical reason, you aren’t. People aren’t usually aware of it, but the very framework of their thought process is highly influenced by what they’re feeling at the time – sometimes subtly, sometimes not. As the Caltech neuroscientist Ralph Adolphs puts it: “Each emotion is a functional state of the mind that puts your brain in a particular mode of operation that adjusts your goals, directs your attention, and modifies the weights you assign to various factors as you do mental calculations.” Think of an iPhone. In its normal mode of operation, the phone’s goal is to always be ready to serve you. To best accomplish that, the iPhone is constantly at work, doing things like “listening” for you to yell “Hey, Siri”, checking to see if there are new emails to download, and updating your apps even if you are not currently using them. In low-power mode, the priorities are changed. Energy conservation is important, so these actions are reduced or stopped altogether. Though enormously more complex, the human brain is like an iPhone in that it constantly carries out computations. It evolved to compute what actions would be most likely to nurture your health, prevent premature death and increase the probability that you will successfully reproduce. And like the iPhone, our brains possess a number of specialised programs, each tailored to solving a problem. Some of our programs apply to practical issues such as foraging, mate choice, facial recognition, sleep management and energy allocation. Others handle cognitive issues such as learning, memory, goal selection and so on. Just as the iPhone adjusts its programming when in low-power mode, a biological brain can run in various modes, each with different characteristics. An emotion – both in humans and animals – is a functional backdrop that orchestrates and coordinates those many programs in a manner tuned to the type of situation you are in. Consider anger, for example. Backed by the threat of aggression, anger creates incentives for others to appease the angry individual. Your mental calculus inflates the importance you place on your own welfare and goals at the expense of those of others. Coaches tap into anger as a motivational tool because the focus on self encourages athletes to push themselves to achieve their goals. Anger also causes you to perceive less risk, exacerbating risk-seeking. That can produce better judgments in situations where risk-aversion is inappropriate, as when you are analysing stocks, or playing poker. The new view of emotion may not correspond to the way Darwin saw it, but it does support one of the basic conclusions of his theory of evolution: humans are not as different from non-human animals as people believed. What can we learn from this? The first and most crucial step is self-awareness. Studies show that those with high levels of emotional intelligence fare better in their personal and professional lives. By learning about our emotions we can read others better and communicate more effectively. And by understanding how emotions affect our thoughts and reasoning, we can learn to recognise and monitor them. Then, once we’re in touch with our true feelings, we can take steps to manage them whenever that would be of benefit.

1/5/2022,"The new head of an investigation into alleged rule-breaking Downing Street parties has not “started from scratch” and is unlikely to re-interview all government staff who have already been spoken to about their knowledge of the gatherings, the Guardian has been told. Sources said that Sue Gray, who took over the probe after cabinet secretary Simon Case recused himself when a Christmas event in his own office was revealed, would more likely “pick up” the existing work and look for “holes” in the testimony provided so far.  In addition, Gray’s attention will have to turn to more gatherings that came to light since the initial probe led by Case began. Among them was an event revealed by the Guardian attended by prime minister Boris Johnson, his wife and 17 others. Attendees were pictured with cheese and wine in the No 10 garden in spring 2020, when socialising in groups was banned. The prime minister has insisted it was a “work meeting”. One insider with knowledge of the investigation said they did not expect everyone already interviewed to have to go through the process again. They characterised the inquiry as “same team, different leader”. A second government source said Gray was unlikely to “discount anything the team has gathered before”, but that given the final report will be in her name, she would probably go through existing witness evidence to check for “holes” and seek further clarification from some people. They said Gray was not expected to re-interview everyone for the sake of it, explaining: “She won’t do things by default, she’ll be pragmatic.” The source added that “a different leader can make a team do different things”. It was initially hoped the parties probe would be concluded by Christmas. However, Case’s decision to step back from his role in it delayed the publication of its findings. Given there are more gatherings than the three included in the initial remit of investigators, Gray was said to have “a lot more on her plate than Case started with” so she would not have “started from scratch”. The result of her inquiry is expected to take several more weeks, however it will be made public. No 10 said the investigation was continuing, but stressed it was an “independent piece of work”. Asked if Gray would pick up where Case left off, the prime minister’s spokesperson said on Tuesday: “The work was led … through the propriety and ethics team.... She has picked up that and has been briefed by them.” The Cabinet Office declined to comment, but pointed to the original terms of reference laid down when Case ran the inquiry, which said investigators would “be able to speak to members of staff” and that ministers, special advisers, and civil servants “will be expected to cooperate”. Gray has a fearsome reputation as a “Whitehall enforcer” and her appointment to lead the probe was seen by many as making it less likely ministers would be able to evade scrutiny over the issue of potentially rule-breaking parties. However another Whitehall probe into the funding of refurbishments to Johnson’s Downing Street flat is reportedly set to clear him of breaching the ministerial code, fuelling claims of a “whitewash”. Johnson has denied personally breaking any Covid rules and said the inquiry into the gatherings would be released “as soon as we reasonably can”.",News/Politics,New head of No 10 parties investigation ‘unlikely to start from scratch’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/05/new-head-of-no-10-parties-investigation-unlikely-to-start-from-scratch
1/5/2022,"The last of Britain’s glaciers melted 10,000 years ago, but the way they shaped the landscape still affects our lives today. Locations of towns and cities have been determined by which direction those giant rivers of ice flowed; tourists flock to see the picturesque lakes and hills sculpted by their brute force, and gardeners curse soils with an overabundance of glacial clay. Now those ancient ice sheets are reminding us of their existence out at sea too, influencing which locations are suitable for offshore windfarms. Gareth Carter, a marine geoscientist at the British Geological Survey, has been using subsurface imagery to map the land under the North Sea and advising engineers where to site their foundations for the huge Dogger Bank Wind Farm, 80 miles (130km) off the north-east coast of England.  “Glacial sediments are highly variable, ranging from layered soft silts and clays, deposited in a lake formed by meltwater in front of the melting ice sheet, through to incredibly hard, chaotic and contorted deposits, dumped by a departing ice sheet,” he says. As windfarms move to ever deeper waters and rely on innovative anchor technologies to hold floating turbines in place, Carter and his colleagues are finding themselves in ever more demand, helping engineers to avoid troublesome boulders and identify suitable ground for foundations.",News/Science,Terrawatch: the link between ancient ice sheets and offshore windfarms,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/05/terrawatch-the-link-between-ancient-ice-sheets-and-offshore-windfarms
1/5/2022,"This year, my new year resolution is to finish the first draft of a novel. It’s a realistic goal – I’m not saying it has to make money, or even be any good. I just want the words on the page, even if all they do then is languish for ever in a folder. Well, I say that’s what I want – but of course finishing a draft was my new year resolution last year, and the year before that, and before that. In truth, I’ve been pushing back this particular ambition since 2017.  Maybe for you, it’s running a marathon – or a 5k. It might be losing a particular amount of weight, or completing a course in yoga or a foreign language. It could be a time-intensive project such as making a quilt or researching your family history. Many of us have these mid- to long-term goals that are ambitious, but (in theory) achievable with the requisite investment of time and effort. I’m going to guess that many other people also have not made a start – even if last year’s lockdowns meant that they, like me, had endless hours to fill. So why do we put off these goals, and how can we make 2022 the year we finally attain them? I spoke to experts to find out. “It’s a very human problem,” says Fuschia Sirois when I describe my situation. A professor of psychology at the University of Sheffield, Sirois studies procrastination and perfectionism – and their toll on wellbeing. She says both factor into our failure to get started on projects. “When you’re working towards something and you’re not quite there, anything is possible; you can imagine how successful it will be,” says Sirois. “But we know that’s not what happens in real life.” In other words, just taking a step towards my goal will be a sobering reminder of the long road ahead. The story I’m capable of writing may not be bad, but it will, inevitably, be unlike how I have imagined it, and that realisation alone can throw us off, says Sirois. “We preserve that goal when we never get started – it just becomes that abstract thing, out there.” So willpower and a plan are not necessarily enough. Sirois’s research shows that we procrastinate on a task to avoid difficult emotions. “We are not rational beings. Our fears, anxieties, personal internal struggles, the negative scripts we have about ourselves, our self-esteem – all these things come into motion.” Procrastinating can then add another layer of self-criticism – while perfectionism can trick us into thinking that there’s an optimum time to start. The paralysis Sirois describes is painfully familiar. I couldn’t count the number of weeknights and weekends that I’ve felt ambient guilt for not writing, even though I had not planned to do so. Sirois suggests, instead, that I try drilling down into these emotional blocks. For instance, they could represent my being critical of myself, which I can meet with self-compassion – or my uncertainty about the task, calling for research. “It’s easy to blame the plan. It’s much harder to say: ‘I don’t know how to manage my emotions’,” says Sirois. Part of the problem, she says, is that we find it hard to accurately forecast our emotional states, meaning we can overstate the struggle of working towards our goal or the satisfaction we will feel achieving it – or both. “What we learn about ourselves along those longer journeys such as running a marathon or writing a novel, how we build our skills, the relationships we make and strengthen: that is actually what makes the experience much more rich and rewarding than we could ever imagine – but we tend to forget these things.” The solution, says Sirois, is to seek meaning from the process, not the outcome. A recent study showed that people who thought about why their goal was important to them spent much less time procrastinating than those who only thought about how good it would feel to achieve it. If I thought my latest chapter was bad, she suggests that I could reframe it to myself as “I’m becoming a better writer”. Someone training for a marathon might focus on keeping fit, spending time with friends, or following in family members’ footsteps. “You can look at the struggles you’re experiencing in a broader perspective, to see what it means in terms of your own personal growth,” says Sirois. But it’s tough, even for the experts. When she was on deadline for her recent audiobook, Do It Now: Overcoming Proscrastination, Sirois says, “it took me for ever to get started”. Katy Milkman, a behavioural scientist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and author of How to Change, suggests the barrier to making progress is often our bias towards feeling good now. “It may not be that pleasant, in the moment, to achieve that long-term goal,” she says. “You know you should, you know that you will be glad when you have – but each time you sit down, there’s something more tempting or proximate that is taking your attention away.” One way to overcome this is by linking the task to something pleasurable – for instance, restricting our favourite snacks or tea to writing sessions or watching TV only when on the treadmill. Milkman mentions a student who let herself light a scented candle only when she was working on her dissertation. It would have to be a pretty special scented candle, I say. “I agree,” says Milkman. “That’s not the thing for me.” Instead, she has beloved audiobooks that she uses to motivate herself for workouts. Another way is to use cash. Milkman recently conducted a “megastudy” of more than 60,000 US gym members, which found that this worked. Awarding reward points (equivalent to only 9¢ or about 6½p) to people who returned to the gym after missing a planned workout increased visits by about 16% compared with the baseline offering. Extending a bigger reward (points worth $1.75) for every workout was almost as effective, increasing visits by about 14%. So, if you want to run a marathon, try paying yourself a pound for every day you stick to your training plan. That strategy can be applied as the stick, not just the carrot, says Milkman: ask a loved one to charge you for every run you miss. That also adds an extra layer of accountability. If you don’t want to burden friends with this, there are services that automate it. Beeminder.com, for instance, plots your progress towards a quantifiable goal on a graph. When you cross to the wrong side of your trend line, Beeminder charges you. StickK.com likewise leverages the “psychological power of loss aversion” to drive behaviour change, charging you when you break the terms of your “commitment contract”. According to Beeminder, you might find this strategy effective if there is “anything you know you should do, you really do want to do, you know for certain you can do, yet that, historically, you don’t do”. Also, if you are a “nerdy, lifehacking data freak”. Sounds like me. I stop short of signing up, for now, but I think this would work better for me than a scented candle. One of the most common strategies for success is to visualise it – picturing yourself crossing the finish line with a personal best, or seeing your bestseller on shelves. But, says Gabriele Oettingen – a professor of psychology at New York University and the University of Hamburg, and author of Rethinking Positive Thinking: Inside the New Science of Motivation – this could actually be counterproductive. Over many studies, her research has established an unexpected but powerful correlation between positive thinking and poor performance. “The more positive a daydream about the future, the less I put in effort to actually realise it,” Oettingen explains over Zoom from New York. In other words, fantasising about our goals makes us feel good in the short term – to the point of lowering our blood pressure – but it saps us of the energy we need to take action. “People feel accomplished,” says Oettingen. “Like they’re already there.” Worryingly, Oettingen suggests, this inaction could over time even lead to depression, with a correlative link established between fantasising about the future and a more negative mood. So, instead of simply visualising, Oettingen advocates what she calls “mental contrasting”: not just fantasising about success but comparing your daydream with reality to reveal what, specifically, is holding you back from achieving it. Once you understand clearly the obstacles standing in your way, you can plan to overcome them with an “if it’s this then I do that” plan. For example, my issue is that I prioritise work over writing my novel. So I could resolve to write fiction first thing in the morning, before I check my work email. Or if my goal was to jog in the evenings, but I lacked the motivation at the end of the workday, I could start small by putting on my running shoes before I clocked off – helping me over the first hurdle. Oettingen dubs this approach “Woop” – wish, outcome, obstacle, plan – and says it works for just about any behaviour change, from creating healthy habits to improving relationships and academic performance. (There are free resources at woopmylife.org, and an app.) Once you have nailed down what is holding you back, you will find that you are energised to work towards your goal – or that you aren’t as invested in it as you thought. In that case, Oettingen says, you can let go of this dream without guilt. You could well find out that your goal was something you thought you should achieve, she says, because it is socially desirable or something your family and friends want. “By really looking at the obstacle, I will understand what to do to overcome it – I will also understand if the obstacle is too costly, there is not enough time, or it is simply not surmountable,” she says. “And then, with good conscience and full consciousness, I will simply get out and devote myself to more promising, feasible futures … Mental contrasting is a way to clean up your life.” And with that, Oettingen articulates the uneasy thought I have every time another new year rolls around without a draft done: how much can I really want to write this novel, if I still haven’t finished it? Dave Evans was an early employee at Apple under Steve Jobs, and led the design of its first mouse. Now – as co-leader of Stanford University’s Designing Your Life course, and as co-author (with his boss Bill Burnett) of the bestseller of the same name – he teaches a practical approach to problem-solving. “We’re the get-you-unstuck guys,” he says cheerfully over Zoom from his office in sunny California. What I am grappling with, Evans tells me, is known as an “anchor problem” – in other words I am stuck on only one solution to my goal, which makes it “either impossible, or incredibly difficult to reach”.. Evans suggests a spot of reverse engineering – that I try reframing my problem by picturing myself six months after I’ve finished my draft. Why, specifically, am I happy? How is my life different, or better? “The first thing you have to do is be really empathetic with yourself, and with the person you think you’re trying to be.” From there, he says, you can work backwards. It might be that what future Elle wants, more than a finished draft, is to have a regular practice of fiction-writing – and I (she?) can work towards that without needing 80,000 words to show for it, Evans points out. “Give yourself a chance at succeeding,” he says. “One of the biggest problems psychologically with the grand goal is unattainability. It’s incredibly de-energising – people give up. So set the bar low: ‘What if I wrote for a week? I’m not writing a novel, I’m writing a chapter.’ Then do it again. Give yourself a chance at succeeding,” says Evans. He calls this prototyping: exploring different paths and possibilities through defined experiments. “Before you run a marathon, try a couple of 10ks,” he suggests. Not just for practice, but because you may find that achievement is enough, or that you don’t enjoy running enough to do a full marathon. The flexibility helps to ground your goal in reality, Evans says – to connect with your actual motivation, and confront the inevitable cost of pursuing it at the expense of other goals. “Many people who have this goal – the book, the marathon, the peak, ‘gotta lose 50lb’ – have almost no idea at all what’s involved.” Some may even be in a “long-term, nostalgic relationship” with their fantasy, says Evans. “But design always starts with reality.” If you revisit your goal and find it is no longer relevant, you can still honour it as something that was significant to your past self, which has steered you this far and from which you can now move on. People who test their “grand goal” report feeling two things, says Evans: “They feel more hopeful – and they feel it’s doable.” I assure him that I’ll check back in next year. Then, that night, I write a scene: messy, not beautiful, but words on a page.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Run that marathon! Write that novel!

1/5/2022,"The Mail on Sunday will pay the Duchess of Sussex just £1 in damages for invading her privacy by publishing a private letter she had sent to her father. The nominal sum is set out in court documents that also formally confirm that the newspaper – and its sister website MailOnline – has accepted defeat and will not be taking the long-running case to a supreme court appeal.  The outlet will also pay an unspecified sum for the separate case of infringing Meghan’s copyright by publishing large chunks of the letter. Mark Stephens, a media lawyer, suggested that the nominal settlement for the privacy aspect suggested a weakness in that aspect of Meghan’s case: “Normally for that kind of invasion of privacy you would expect £75,000 to £125,000. It does show that the curation of her reputation was an area where she had effectively invaded her own privacy.” The newspaper’s publisher has also agreed to pay a confidential sum in damages for copyright infringement. The Mail on Sunday also faces having to cover a substantial part of Meghan’s legal costs, which could be more than £1m. The duchess had always said that her three-year legal battle against Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and sister website MailOnline, was more about principles than money. As part of the court settlement the Mail outlets have also been ordered to avoid disclosing the names of five of Meghan’s friends who anonymously spoke to People magazine for a 2018 article about the royal. The newspaper had previously sought to name the individuals in legal proceedings. The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline were also ordered to carry front and homepage declarations that they had lost the legal case, with the courts even specifying which font the statements should appear in. The outlets chose to do that on Boxing Day, one of the quietest news days of the year. Associated Newspapers had argued that Meghan’s case should have gone to trial but judges concluded ruled otherwise. A ruling at the start of December said the duchess had a “reasonable expectation” of privacy regarding the contents of the letter to her father, Thomas Markle. “Those contents were personal, private and not matters of legitimate public interest,” said appeal judge Sir Geoffrey Vos. Meghan celebrated that victory by calling for a reshaping of the tabloid industry and spoke of how she had been patient in the face of “deception, intimidation, and calculated attacks” and criticised a “tabloid industry that conditions people to be cruel, and profits from the lies and pain that they create”. At the time Associated Newspapers claimed it was willing to take the case to the supreme court but this turned out to be an empty threat. Focus is now likely to turn to the actions of the duchess’s husband, Prince Harry, who is suing both Rupert Murdoch’s News UK and Daily Mirror publisher Reach over phone-hacking claims in a case that could be heard later this year.",News/UK news,Meghan to receive just £1 from Mail on Sunday for privacy invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/05/meghan-one-pound-mail-on-sunday-privacy-invasion
1/5/2022,"I’m standing near the cliff edge, on a narrow strip of wild, unmanaged grassland and scrub, with a light, onshore breeze in my face. Beyond the precipice lies the North Sea, calm today. To the south, ships at anchor waiting for a berth, offshore wind turbines and industrial Teesside. To the north, the conurbations of Seaham, Sunderland and South Tyneside. Behind me, agriculture, the coastal railway and a quarry. It’s high tide, bringing from far below the soporific sound of waves slapping against rocks. Fulmars, stiff-winged and silent, glide past the cliff edge, almost level with my head, giving me a sideways glance as they pass, as if to say: “I bet you wish you could do this.” And I do: it looks so effortless, so pleasurable.  Turning away with a few shallow wingbeats, around they go again, out to sea, then back towards the cliff face, lowering their feet as air brakes at the last moment as they rise to ride the updraught once more. They pass so close that I can see turbulent airflow ruffling small feathers over the top of their long, slender wings, generating lift. Around the headland is an impenetrable wall of wind-sculpted blackthorn, which suddenly opens on to another vertiginous, grassy slope, revealing the tiny bay called Hawthorn Hive. The rock face is magnesian limestone; soft, fast-weathering, prone to landslips. Eventually, storms and sea level rise will send this narrow remnant of wilderness crashing down on to the shore. Every winter, waves chew away at the raised beach that protects the cliffs. A flicker of wings catches my eye: two small birds, flitting skywards to catch flies. They are hard to identify with the sun in my eyes and lead me a merry dance as I try to get closer. Following them back along the path, I finally see that they are stonechats. The male’s breast feathers are the colour of a glowing ember. It’s perhaps just as well that knee-high brambles, as daunting as a barbed-wire entanglement, prevent me from getting any closer to their cliff-edge perch.
