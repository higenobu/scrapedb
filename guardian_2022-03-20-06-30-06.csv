3/20/2022,"Internazionale dropped more points in the Serie A title race on Saturday when they were held to a 1-1 draw by Fiorentina at San Siro. The game was goalless at half-time, with Inter’s Samir Handanovic called into action to stop long range efforts. Fiorentina’s Pietro Terracciano denied Edin Dzeko from close range before Lautaro Martínez’s strike was disallowed for offside. The visitors’ sustained pressure paid off early in the second half when Gaetano Castrovilli cut open Inter’s defence. His pass found Nicolas Gonzalez in the penalty area, and the forward’s quick cutback was fired in by Lucas Torreira. Simone Inzaghi’s side levelled within five minutes, with Ivan Perisic floating a cross into the box for fellow wing-back Denzel Dumfries to head home. Fiorentina almost grabbed a late winner, Handanovic denying Jonathan Ikone on the break – but the draw means Inter have won only one of their last seven league games. Napoli are three points clear of Inter in second place after fighting back to beat Udinese 2-1 at home. Luciano Spalletti’s side fell behind in the 22nd minute after Gerard Deulofeu arrowed a strike into the net, but Victor Osimhen headed Napoli level seven minutes after the restart, then added the second with a near-post finish. A second double in a week for the Nigerian striker was enough to secure back-to-back wins for Napoli, while Pablo Marí’s late red card ended the visitors’ hope of finding an equaliser. Napoli move level on points with leaders Milan, who travel to struggling Cagliari on Saturday evening. In the Bundesliga, Bayern Munich got their title bid back on track with a dominant 4-0 home win over Union Berlin. Robert Lewandowski scored either side of half-time as Bayern moved seven points clear of Borussia Dortmund, who play Cologne on Sunday. Bayern had drawn their last two league fixtures, against Hoffenheim and Leverkusen, but never looked in danger after taking an early lead. With 16 minutes on the clock, Kingsley Coman’s shot from outside the box caught out Union keeper Andreas Luthe. Centre-back Tanguy Nianzou powered in a header in the 25th minute, before Lewandowski converted a penalty on the stroke of half-time after being brought down by Luthe. The Poland forward struck again two minutes after the restart, converting Jamal Musiala’s cross to take his league tally to 31 goals this season. Hertha Berlin climbed out of the bottom two and ended a nine-game winless run with a 3-0 victory over Hoffenheim, despite new head coach Felix Magath missing the match due to a Covid-19 infection. It was left to Magath’s assistant, Mark Fotheringham, to lead the team and the Scot oversaw a dominant win, with Marvin Plattenhardt’s set-pieces creating all three goals. Niklas Stark, Ishak Belfodil and Lucas Tousart all scored as Hertha climbed above Arminia Bielefeld, who were beaten 4-0 at mid-table Mainz. Stuttgart also boosted their hopes of beating the drop with a 3-2 home win over fellow strugglers Augsburg. The hosts had to come from behind twice but sealed a dramatic victory when Tiago Tomás fired into the roof of the net with five minutes to go. Elsewhere, Freiburg edged back into the top four with a goalless draw at bottom club Greuther Fürth.
