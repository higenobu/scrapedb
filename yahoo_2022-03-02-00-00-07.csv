3/2/2022,"France's finance minister said Tuesday that Western sanctions would cause the Russian economy to collapse. A top Russian official responded immediately, saying that economic wars often turn into ""real wars."" The West has leveled sweeping sanctions against Russia that appear to be disrupting its economy. A top Russian official appeared to threaten France with ""real war"" on Tuesday as he responded to saber-rattling comments from the French finance minister about the effects of punitive Western sanctions. In an interview with French radio Tuesday morning, Bruno Le Maire said the West aimed to ""cause the collapse of the Russian economy"" through an ""economic and financial war on Russia,"" for which the Russian population ""will also pay the consequences."" Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former prime minister and now deputy chairman of its security council, was quick to respond on Twitter. He said: ""A French minister said today that they have declared an economic war on us. Watch what you say, gentlemen! And don't forget that in the history of mankind, economic wars have often turned into real wars."" Western nations including France have placed sweeping sanctions on Russia, targeting everything from its central bank and leading financial institutions to President Vladimir Putin himself. The sanctions seem to have already disrupted the Russian economy. On Monday, the value of the ruble crashed by as much as 30% against the US dollar, forcing Russia's central bank to more than double its base interest rate to 20%. Meanwhile, Russians were pictured at ATMs trying to withdraw foreign currency. In an interview with France Info on Tuesday, Le Maire said that economic and financial sanctions leveled by the West against Russia were ""extremely effective,"" adding: ""I don't want to leave any ambiguity about the determination of Europe on this subject. We are going to wage an economic and financial war on Russia."" He continued: ""We want to target the heart of the Russian system, we'll target Vladimir Putin, we'll target the oligarchs, but we'll also target the entire Russian economy."" He added: ""Sanctions must strike fast, strike hard, and we are already seeing the effects. The ruble has collapsed by 30%. Russian foreign exchange reserves are melting like snow in the sun and Vladimir Putin's famous war chest has already reduced to almost nothing."" Le Maire said: ""We are going to cause the collapse of the Russian economy."" On Monday, the US rolled out fresh sanctions intended to stop Putin accessing a $630 billion foreign exchange ""war chest"" he could use to prop up Russia's battered economy. The move followed analogous sanctions from the European Union and the UK.

3/2/2022,"The Felicity Ace, the cargo ship that caught fire while carrying thousands of brand new Volkswagen, Porsche, and Lamborghini vehicles, sunk Tuesday morning, according to a press statement. The ship, which was carrying around 4000 cars, sank after it ""suffered a list to starboard,"" a press release from its operators said Tuesday. The Felicity Ace became submerged around 253 miles away from the Portuguese archipelago of Azores around 9 a.m. local time on Tuesday. A spokesperson for the Felicity Ace told Road & Track the information comes from a local ship salvage team. Bloomberg reports that the ship and its salvage crews were fighting harsh seas before it sunk. “The weather was pretty rough out there,” Pat Adamson, a spokesperson for the Felicity Ace's operator, MOL Ship Management, said to Bloomberg. “And then she sank, which was a surprise.” Before Tuesday, the last update from the vessel's owners, Japan-based Mitsui O.S.K. Lines transportation company (MOL), came on February 25, saying the boat was stable and had been boarded by salvage crews. The company said it was using a salvage vessel to move the Felicity Ace to a safe area off Azores. The troubles began on February 16, when the vessel caught fire while en route from Emden, Germany to Davisville, Rhode Island. The fire continued for several days, finally dying down on February 25, according to MOL. All crew were evacuated without injury, and the ship was abandoned. The Felicity Ace's fire was reportedly complicated by a number of electric cars onboard, with batteries that caught fire. It's still unclear what initially caused the blaze.

3/2/2022,"Russia has said it will temporarily block foreign companies from exiting investments in the country. BP, Shell and other major companies have said they'll cut ties to Russia over the war in Ukraine. Russia's ban adds to the difficulties for foreign investors, who are scrambling to work out what effect Western sanctions will have. Russia plans to temporarily block Western companies from exiting their investments in the country, as the government steps up the defense of its troubled economy and BP and others scramble to cut ties there. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin told a government meeting Tuesday that Moscow is preparing a presidential decree that would temporarily limit the ability of foreign investors to sell Russian assets. The move came after the US and its allies imposed tough new sanctions on Russia's banks and central bank that have piled the pressure on the country's financial system and on Western companies with Russian links. ""In the current situation of sanctions, foreign entrepreneurs are forced to work based, not on economic concerns, but under political pressure,"" Mishustin said, according to Bloomberg's translation. He did not provide further details on the temporary ban. Western companies have rushed for the exit after Russia invaded Ukraine last Thursday, unleashing what could become Europe's bloodiest war since 1945. BP is set to sell its almost 20% stake in oil exploration company Rosneft, potentially racking up a $25 billion loss. Fellow oil giant Shell and Norwegian state energy company Equinor have also said they'll exit joint ventures in Russia. France's TotalEnergies said it would no longer provide capital for new projects in Russia, according to a tweet from chief executive Patrick Pouyanne. It was unclear what effect the Russian move would have on the companies as of Tuesday morning. Major financial index provider MSCI said it's considering cutting Russian assets from its benchmark indices, which could cut the amount of investment in the country.

On top of that, the Moscow stock exchange has been shut for Monday and Tuesday as authorities try to limit financial damage. The country's stock market plunged as much as 50% in a day last week. London-listed Russian assets have been pulverized in recent days. Russia's biggest bank, Sberbank, fell as much as 77% Monday in London and was down more than 94% since the start of the year as of Tuesday.

3/2/2022,"By Stephanie Nebehay GENEVA (Reuters) -More than 100 diplomats from some 40 Western countries and allies including Japan walked out of a speech by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to the top U.N. human rights forum on Tuesday in protest over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The boycott by envoys from the European Union, the United States, Britain and others left only a few diplomats in the room including Russia's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, Gennady Gatilov, who is a former deputy to Lavrov. Envoys from Syria, China and Venezuela were among delegations that stayed. Lavrov was addressing the U.N. Human Rights Council remotely, after cancelling his visit due to what the Russian mission said on Monday were EU states blocking his flight path. Neutral Switzerland also imposed financial sanctions on Lavrov on Monday, a measure of the international revulsion over an invasion Russia describes as a ""special military operation"" aimed at dislodging ""neo-Nazis"" ruling Ukraine. In his speech, Lavrov accused the EU of engaging in a ""Russophobic frenzy"" by supplying lethal weapons to Ukraine during Moscow's military campaign that began last Thursday. A Russian armoured column bore down on Ukraine's capital Kyiv on Tuesday and invasion forces fired rocket barrages into the centre of Kharkiv, the country's second largest city, on the sixth day of Russia's assault on its neighbour. 'SHOW OF SUPPORT' Among the diplomats who walked out, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly and Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod joined Ukraine's ambassador Yevheniia Filipenko behind a large Ukrainian blue and yellow flag. ""It is a remarkable show of support for Ukrainians who are fighting for their independence,"" Filipenko told reporters. Filipenko said there had been ""massive destruction to civilian infrastructure"" in Kharkiv, adding: ""The maternity wards are being attacked, civilian residential buildings are being bombed."" Russia denies targeting any civilian sites. Canada's Joly said: ""Minister Lavrov was giving his version, which is false, about what is happening in Ukraine and so that's why we wanted to show a very strong stance together."" Later on Tuesday Canada will petition the International Criminal Court over what Joly said were Russia's ""crimes against humanity and war crimes"". [L8N2V44MO] She was referring to the Hague-based court where the office of the ICC prosecutor on Monday said it would seek court approval to open an investigation into alleged war crimes in Ukraine. The U.S. envoy to the Human Rights Council, Michele Taylor, said in a statement: ""This Russian war of aggression will have profound implications for human rights in Ukraine and Russia, and the leaders of Russia will be held accountable.""

3/2/2022,"Howard Stern on Monday offered a searing critique of Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, who have praised Russian President Vladimir Putin. Commenting on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the SiriusXM radio host noted his hatred for communism and previous love for Republicans who were “pro-capitalist, anti-communist and certainly a staunch defender of free people and free elections.” But, he lamented, that love was no more. “I voted for many Republicans. I don’t see how I’ll ever get back to that,” said Stern. “They’ve just totally disappointed me and their support of Vladimir Putin, the praise they heap on him. Trump’s praise of Vladimir Putin. This guy’s a fucking animal. I wish he was dead, like I wish Hitler was dead.” Trump last week continued his yearslong celebration of Putin, hailing Russia’s invasion of neighboring Ukraine as “pretty smart.” He also praised Putin as a “genius.” Stern later laced into Putin himself, calling him a “scumbag” who “enslaves an entire country” and “will kill you if you speak out against him.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/2/2022,"Russia has yet to take a key airfield in Ukraine they thought they'd capture within a day, the UK's Ministry of Defence has said. Vladimir Putin launched an all-out attempt to invade Ukraine on Thursday, but according to intelligence reports his troops has yet to make any significant gains as Ukrainians desperately fight them off. Russia had claimed to have taken Hostomel Airport – also known as Antonov Airport – on Thursday. The strategically vital airport, just 10km outside of Kyiv, has a long runway which can land heavy-lift transport planes, potentially meaning Russia could airlift soldiers to the outskirts of the capital. But Ukraine snatched it back within hours as Russian forces attempted to take a number of locations across the country. Read more: Putin orders nuclear alert as Ukraine fiercely resists Russian invasion The Ministry of Defence said in a tweet: “The bulk of Putin’s ground forces remain more than 30km to the north of Kyiv their advance having been slowed by Ukrainian forces defending Hostomel airfield, a key Russian objective for day one of the conflict."" It added: “Heavy fighting continues around Chernihiv and Kharkiv however both cities remain under Ukrainian control. “Logistical failures and staunch Ukrainian resistance continue to frustrate the Russian advance. “Despite continued attempts to suppress details of the conflict from the Russian population, the Russian Armed Forces has for the first time been forced to acknowledge suffering casualties.” Reports have suggested Putin believed Ukraine would fall within 48 hours, but after facing fierce opposition from the Ukrainians, the conflict has entered day five. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace told Sky News that the Russia invasion is now ""behind schedule"", and left troops in ""disarray."" ""They based all of this on this sort of bizarre assumption that the Ukrainians would welcome them as liberators, well president Putin has taken that assumption, and now that's not the case that's causing them to pause. It's causing them logistical trouble,"" he said. Read more: Stage set for Belarus peace talks after Putin puts nuclear forces on high alert While Putin may have planned a swift victory, it seems he may have underestimated the ferocity of the Ukrainian defence and their leader. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Velenskyy – a former TV comedian and actor – has become one of the most recognisable faces in the world, and garnered admiration for his determination in beating Russia. When the US offered him an evacuation out of Kyiv, he declined, telling them: ""I need ammunition, not a ride."" Putin ordered Russia's nuclear forces on to high alert on Sunday, in response to what he said was ""unfriendly"" steps from the West. Wallace said this was a “big attempt to distract away from his troubles in Ukraine”. The defence secretary did not rule out Putin launching a nuclear attack, and was asked on Sky News whether the Russian leader was “crazy enough” to start a nuclear conflict. Wallace responded: “I think he has certainly done a lot of irrational things recently.” He added: “I think I’m not going to speculate on what he would or wouldn’t do, but that’s why we all keep our deterrents at a state of readiness in the West.” Read more: Who is president Volodymyr Zelenskyy - Russia's 'enemy number one'? In response to the aggression, much of the world has placed tough sanctions on Russia, cause the ruble to plunge to an all-time low, wreaking havoc on the Russian economy.

3/2/2022,"Russia's Gazprom said Monday it signed a contract to design a huge Russia-China natural gas pipeline. The Soyuz Vostok pipeline would deliver up to 1.77 trillion cubic feet of natural gas each year via Mongolia. Sanctions imposed by Western nations have hobbled Russia's economy after it invaded Ukraine. Russia is pushing ahead with plans to build a new massive pipeline carrying natural gas to China as Western sanctions strangle its economy. Gazprom, the Kremlin-controlled energy giant, said on Monday that it had signed a contract to perform design and survey work as part of the construction of the Soyuz Vostok gas pipeline. The proposed pipeline would deliver up to 50 billion cubic meters (1.77 trillion cubic feet) of Russian natural gas each year to China via Mongolia, Gazprom said. Bloomberg reported that if plans for the pipeline went through, it could be Gazprom's biggest-ever deal with China. Countries and trade blocs including the European Union, UK, US, Canada, and Japan have responded to Russia's invasion of Ukraine with sanctions designed to hobble Russia's economy. The measures have targeted the banking system and trade, among other areas, and have led to a slump in the ruble, a huge hike in interest rates, and rising inflation. But crucially, the West hasn't yet banned Russian energy imports. Europe gets around 40% of its natural gas supply from Russia and has continued to rely on it since the invasion started. China, meanwhile, has avoided criticism of Russia's move into Ukraine, and repeatedly refrained from calling Moscow's actions an invasion. China is Russia's biggest trade partner for both exports and imports, according to Reuters, and bought a third of Russia's crude oil exports in 2020. It supplies Russia with manufactured products from cell phones and computers to toys and clothing. The Soyuz Vostok link could offer Russia better access to alternative markets in the East as energy majors in the West announced they were divesting from their Russian interests. Shell said on Tuesday that it was pulling out from its joint ventures with Gazprom and related businesses, while BP said it's dumping its 20% stake in the Russian state-backed oil firm Rosneft. Germany also halted plans for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, designed to carry gas between Russia and mainland Europe, though German energy firm E.ON said it had rejected calls to shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which continues to pump Russian natural gas to Europe. Bloomberg reported that if Russia and China reached a new supply deal, Gazprom could build an interconnector between its westbound and eastbound pipeline systems, allowing it to divert gas from fields that currently only supply Europe, to China instead. The energy company said that Alexei Miller, chair of the Gazprom Management Committee, and Sainbuyan Amarsaikhan, deputy prime minister of Mongolia, discussed the Soyuz Vostok project at a meeting on Monday. The Soyuz Vostok is also known as the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline. The Power of Siberia 1 pipeline has been pumping natural gas from Russia to China since 2019 as part of a 30-year, $400-billion deal, Bloomberg reported.
