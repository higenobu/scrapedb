2/5/2022,"If Peloton wants to know why the lockdown boom in home exercise was unsustainable, then Ian Rodriguez has a good answer: working out is more fun with other people. Rodriguez, a 52-year-old teacher from Preston, Lancashire, cancelled his gym membership when the pandemic hit but couldn’t wait to get back. As many others did, he spent money on gym equipment, including a rowing machine and some weights. But then he started missing the gym classes.  “I kept fit at home throughout the lockdown, but as restrictions eased, the lack of social interaction started to get to me. I was getting to the stage where I missed going to classes at the gym. Exercising on your own, even with someone shouting at you on a screen during an online course, just isn’t the same,” he says. Rodriguez is now back at the gym “four or five times a week”. Millions of others around the world have responded to the call of the gym instructor, leaving Peloton, the home fitness company, facing further questions about what this means for demand for its exercise bikes, treadmills and online classes when it reports its latest quarterly results on Tuesday. The last few years have been a wild ride for the company. Peloton was one of the symbolic commercial successes of the global pandemic lockdown, along with the likes of Zoom, Netflix and Amazon. It floated in 2019 at $29 per share and its valuation approached $50bn in January 2021 as shares went over $160 at the height of lockdown restrictions. But Peloton’s fortunes have turned, and the valuation has sped downhill dramatically. Today, the company is worth as much as it was around flotation, at $8bn. Late on Friday, however, shares in Peloton surged more than 30% in after-hours trading after a report in the Wall Street Journal that Amazon is considering making a bid for the company. A takeover bid from one of the world’s biggest businesses would be in keeping with a high-profile brand that is used to making headlines. In May last year, Peloton recalled its two treadmills following the death of a child and dozens of other injuries, and in late 2019 it was lambasted for a “sexist and dystopian” Christmas advert, which featured a woman recording a video diary of her Peloton use after her partner gave her a bike. In December, its shares tumbled following the onscreen death of the Sex and the City character Mr Big while riding a Peloton in the series reboot, And Just Like That. A rushed-out parody ad campaign by Peloton featuring the Mr Big actor, Chris Noth, was subsequently dropped when Noth was accused of sexual assault. Noth denies the accusations. Now, the chief executive, John Foley, is facing pressure from at least one shareholder to resign. Blackwells Capital, an activist investor with a 5% stake in Peloton, says it has “grave concerns” about performance and is calling on its board to fire Foley and explore a sale. Anjali Lai, a senior analyst at the research company Forrester, says Peloton is wrangling over a question that has affected all companies selling goods and services to consumers: how permanent are the changes brought about by the pandemic? “Are the dramatic changes in consumer behaviour that we’ve observed over the last two years a pulling forward of consumer demand, or are they indicative of a long-term, persistent change in what consumers buy, and how? In Peloton’s case, supply and demand has been volatile, which indicates that the at-home fitness experience is an acceleration of consumer demand, not necessarily a persistent change.” Peloton makes and sells exercise bikes (starting at £1,550) and treadmills (starting at £2,545), as well as a monthly subscription fee to its online classes at £12.99 a month. It also makes clothing and accessories, although this is a much smaller part of the business, and recently launched a camera product. As a rough proxy of how many people use its equipment, the company has 2.5m connected fitness subscriptions, in which users pay £39 a month to access classes through their Peloton bike or treadmill. Peloton does not give a geographic breakdown of sales, but it currently ships equipment to the US – its biggest market – plus Canada, the UK and Germany. In its last set of quarterly results in November, it said sales this year will be up to $1bn lower than expected, at $4.4bn-$4.8bn, while the number of monthly workouts by each connected fitness subscriber had fallen to 16, versus 20 for the same period in 2020. It recorded a loss of $376m in the three months to September last year, against net income – a US measure of profit – of $69.3m the year before, as it cut the price of its bikes, ramped up ad spending and suffered problems with its supply chain. The company’s chief financial officer, Jill Woodworth, said: “It is clear that we underestimated the reopening impact on our company and the overall industry.” The New York-based company said last month that it is considering job and production cuts. A CNBC report, citing internal documents, suggested it was planning a temporary halt to bike and treadmill manufacturing. Responding to the claims in a message to his 3,200 staff, Foley started off strong, saying the report was “out of context” and the company was taking legal action against the leaker, before acknowledging that cost cuts were indeed on the way. “In the past, we’ve said layoffs would be the absolute last lever we would ever hope to pull. However, we now need to evaluate our organisation structure and size of our team, with the utmost care and compassion,” he said. In a message that drew heavily on the American corporate lexicon, Foley added that the company would be “resetting”. “We feel good about right-sizing our production, and, as we evolve to more seasonal demand curves, we are resetting our production levels for sustainable growth.” Dan Ives, the managing director of the US investment firm Wedbush Securities, says Peloton is a “revolutionary” product but management failed to foresee a shift in demand. “The clock has struck midnight for Peloton coming out of the WFH environment and there could be some darker days ahead as the company adjusts to a lower growth profile,” he says. Meanwhile, gym owners on both sides of the Atlantic are welcoming back the likes of Ian Rodriguez, albeit against a backdrop of a dire two years for gyms. Pre-pandemic, the UK had 7,239 gyms and 10.4m memberships, according to the Leisure Database Company, a market intelligence firm. It expects both numbers to have fallen last year. In the US, Peloton’s biggest market, about a quarter of health clubs have closed, according to the IHRSA, a fitness industry association, with the number of memberships also expected to drop from the 2019 total of 64m. Nonetheless, one UK gym industry veteran is optimistic about recovery. John Treharne, the founder and director of the Gym Group, which operates 190 low-cost venues around the UK, says that the entire UK market is now “pretty close” to pre-Covid levels and could be back to normal by Easter. And that, he adds, is partly due to people missing the “social aspect” of gathering for a collective workout. “The sort of individuals who might have contemplated using an online or Peloton-type product have clearly returned to the more traditional offering,” he says. Peloton, meanwhile, needs to change gear and adjust to a world where gyms are back in business.",News/Business,Peloton’s fortunes race downhill as fitness fans return to gyms,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/05/pelotons-fortunes-race-downhill-as-fitness-fans-return-to-gyms
2/5/2022,"So you’re levelling up. As your government has spent the last 10 years levelling down, you’ll forgive me if I don’t cheer. To justify why the government has hit people so hard and for so long, I heard one of your predecessors Michael Gove on the Radio 4 Today programme this week repeating the theme song always played for this purpose: it was necessary to make cuts (translation: to make poor people poorer) because there was “no money left” when the government came to power. You’ll know, though, that billions somehow appeared from nowhere in the first phases of the pandemic. Perhaps you also spotted this week that there are great concerns now that some of that money was wasted. Could that be true? I mention this because the journalists looking at the levelling up plans for education are struggling to find what hard cash is going to be handed over to schools. There might be some “creative accounting” going on: announcing “new” funding that is actually old funding.  Leaving that aside, there are two core problems with your so-called levelling up. The first arises when it is cast – as you have – as if inequality were solely a north-south problem. I’ve lived in London all my life. There are some parts of London where a high percentage of people are on the bottom level of incomes. Treating such people as privileged is absurd and insulting. But what kind of levelling up is possible when your government backs the arrangements by which the privileged remain privileged: inheritance of property, tax havens and private education? These create and freeze the “levels” in society. They are built into the system. If there are individuals who can hop up from one level to another, it follows from this set-up that for every person who hops up, someone has to hop down. Who’s volunteering for that? You’re also part of a government that has behaved in the past as if the public sector – of which schools are such a big part – is a beastly drag on society. Yet the public sector is what helps us stay alive long enough to benefit from the crumbs that drop from the rich man’s table. Did “trickle down” ever happen, or was that as empty a slogan as “levelling up”? So these are the contexts for levelling up coming to education. You may already have heard some cynical snorts and guffaws coming from the chalkface. Since 1988, successive governments have treated education as an electoral asset: they’ve come up with endless slogans and projects to supposedly solve what is supposedly a crisis. Each time, they have peddled the narrative of decline, which claims that things are worse now than they were before. Each time, the initiative is heralded as the solution to the decline. Thus, the national curriculum, Sats, Ofsted, city technology colleges, the literacy hour, the numeracy hour, league tables, academies, free schools, the knowledge-rich curriculum, Ofqual, systematic synthetic phonics, eBacc, Education Action Zone, behaviour tsar, Progress 8 … what have I missed out? Some are great but get abolished, some are rubbish but survive. The consistent point about them is that they were all imposed from on high. It seems as if the intellectual ceiling of those in government restricts people from imagining that education could be run in a vastly more participatory and consensual way. And here you are again, sitting in your offices in London cooking up stuff that you say will solve everything for some people out there. On this occasion, the people out there are in the north. You’ve even marshalled some nonsense about wanting everyone to do better at Sats. You’ve had years to get everyone to do better at Sats. You’ve had Ofsted, league tables, academies, free schools, hubs, Ofqual, systematic synthetic phonics to ensure that everyone does better at Sats. What’s gone wrong with your initiatives? You are peddling jiggery-pokery here. I think if you pop down the corridor from your office, nip into another office, you’ll be able to look carefully at how the Sats marking is done. You’ll find that it’s rigged anyway. The setters and markers of the tests decide how many succeed and how many fail before the students even sit down to write their papers. They can level up or down anytime they like. I hope I haven’t shocked you by telling you that. Yours, Michael Rosen",News/Education,"Dear Nadhim Zahawi, your ‘levelling up’ in schools is jiggery-pokery | Michael Rosen",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/05/dear-nadhim-zahawi-levelling-up-schools-jiggery-pokery-michael-rosen
2/5/2022,"Minimalist fashion is huge, so it was only a matter of time before a crop of Scandi-stylised brands appeared, to capitalise on to its devotees. The new beauty minimalism is about a sheer wash of complexion-enhancing skin tint, a flush of good health to the cheeks, lightly fluffed brows (no hard, sharp algorithm-baiting arches here) and a semi-matte neutral lip colour that could feasibly be one’s own. Tasteful, chic and effortless in application, these cool-girl brands, such as Jones Road, 19/99, Westman Atelier and Rituel de Fille, are to beauty what labels like Totême, Raey, The Row and Acne Studios are to fashion. Model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is famous for her minimalist aesthetic, so it stands to reason that her beauty line, Rose Inc, takes its lead from her wardrobe.  But there’s a lot more to love than the pared-back packaging and limited colour palette. The Softlight Luminous Hydrating Concealer (£23) – surprisingly opaque, creamy and blendable – is expansive in shade range and very good overall (and owes a lot to Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer, in my view). Blush Divine Radiant Lip & Cheek, £23, is a smudgy, effortless multitasking tint that sticks around all day and comes in a refillable palette. Authored is social media star Tanya Burr’s new brand of minimalist beauty essentials, and frankly, the determined haters would be wise to stand down. This, perhaps against expectations, is a solid lineup of intelligently formulated and useful products that do as promised. The brand describes itself as “carbon neutral” (it’s a hotly debated issue as to whether this term can apply to any consumer goods), and it certainly has a good stab at increased sustainability, with recyclable lids and aluminium tubes (including, very unusually, a fully aluminium mascara chamber and divisible wand). It’s not perfect – the Tinted Moisturiser, £28, gorgeous though it is on already-clear skin, is too runny to live in a tube without making a little mess. The lip balm is nice but brings little that’s new to the party (except looking great – and why not?), but the brow gel – perfectly glue-like for lasting, non-flaky lift of each hair – is glorious, and the mascara is among the best to launch in a very long time. Unlike most natural-skewed mascaras, it’s proper, sooty-black, gives noticeable volume and is outstanding in its smudge-free staying power.

2/5/2022,"Thursday marked 1,000 days since Ronald Greene died on a roadside in northern Louisiana. And the 1,000th day, too, that Greene’s mother, Mona Hardin, has awaited answers from state and federal authorities. “It’s hard to sleep,” Hardin told the Guardian in an interview. “But it’s something I have to push myself through. It has destroyed my family, because of what we saw and what we know.”  It was 10 May 2019 when Greene was arrested by Louisiana state police for an unspecified traffic violation. The story made public by police back then was that the 49-year-old Black man had led troopers on a high-speed pursuit, crashed his car, and then engaged in “a struggle” before dying. But gradually a clearer narrative emerged, laced with brutality and attempted cover-up. Greene, who was unarmed, had been stunned multiple times with tasers, punched in the face, placed in a chokehold and shackled, and had lain prone for almost 10 minutes before his death at the hands of six white troopers. Body-camera footage of the incident was suppressed for two years until the Associated Press published excerpts last year, showing Greene, his face bloodied, pleading with officers to desist. “I’m sorry!” Greene said. “I’m your brother! I’m scared!” A US justice department civil rights and wrongful death investigation remains pending after an internal review declined to bring charges, allegedly following pressure from senior members of the state police force. But this week, new revelations have sent shockwaves around Louisiana, forcing the state’s Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, to publicly deny he had delayed or interfered with investigations into Greene’s death. The Associated Press reported Edwards received a text message from Louisiana state police superintendent Kevin Reeves just hours after Greene’s death, informing Edwards of a “violent, lengthy struggle” leading to the Black motorist’s death, at a time when public information on the incident was scant. Superintendent Reeves resigned in October 2020 amid mounting scrutiny of the department in the wake of Greene’s death. The message was sent as Edwards was fighting a re-election campaign in a deep red state, which saw the governor make little comment on Greene’s death until years later. The reporting also suggests that Edwards’s handling of the incident is now part of the federal civil rights investigation. During a heated press conference this week, the governor struck a defiant line after his office insisted the text alert had been standard operating procedure. “There are implications that I knew more, or that one or more of my staff members tried to cover up what happened. I will say that that is simply and categorically false,” he said, acknowledging for the first time in public that the killing was a racist act. “It is sad. It is regrettable that I am here under these circumstances talking about these things. But unfortunately, it is unavoidable.” The governor is facing increasingly bipartisan criticism, both from state Republicans who control Louisiana’s legislature, and members of the Democratic Black caucus who held a heated closed door meeting with Edwards earlier this week. Hardin, who lives in Florida, and lost her job shortly after her son’s death due to stress, remained unconvinced by the governor’s denial and has called for his resignation. “It’s a cowardly way for him to approach the murder of a man by his state troopers,” she said. “He said the text message was standard procedure, but there was no follow-up on his end after the murder of a man? They carelessly and lightly really insisted this was ‘standard procedure’. But no one ever made any effort to be honest with me.” Edwards won an incredibly tight 2019 re-election campaign on the shoulders of Black voters. According to election analysis, he won 99% support among the Black community, who turned out in high numbers to push him over the line. “It’s going to be very difficult for Black people to trust him again,” said Eugene Phillips, president of the NAACP Baton Rouge chapter. “He’s going to have to really work hard to rebuild that trust. And at this point I don’t know if he can.” Phillips reiterated the NAACP’s demand that Edwards meet with the Greene family to explain the message and his prior knowledge of the case. As of Wednesday, the Greene family had received no communication from the governor. Edwards, a centrist, is the only statewide Democrat elected to office in Louisiana, and has recently made pronounced comments about the legacy of racism in the state. Last month the governor signed a pardon for Homer Plessy, the civil rights pioneer whose act of civil disobedience in 1892 led to the infamous Plessy v Ferguson supreme court decision. “The stroke of my pen on this pardon, while momentous, it doesn’t erase generations of pain and discrimination,” Edwards said at the time. “It doesn’t eradicate all the wrongs wrought by the Plessy court, or fix all of our present challenges.” But the governor has also signed into law a controversial “blue lives matter” bill in 2016. The act expanded the state’s existing list of groups protected against hate crimes on grounds of race, religion, sexual orientation and other minority groups to include law enforcement officers and other first responders. It faced significant criticism from civil liberties groups and Black Lives Matter activists at the time. For some observers, Edwards’s “standard procedure” defense is perhaps in line with his character both as a no-frills straight-talker, but also as the son and brother of law enforcement officers. “Edwards is very careful. He’s a lawyer with a family background in law enforcement. He’s not given to wild pronouncements or getting ahead of a story,” said Dr Pearson Cross, associate professor of political science at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. “I also think he would be inclined to accept the story, as it was originally told, until he had proof that it was different.” For Mona Hardin, the wait for answers continues. “We still have to hope and pray that everyone digs down real deep, to bring this to its proper course and for everyone who had their hand in this to be held accountable,” she said. “You just can’t keep overlooking the murder of a man. You can’t keep letting these killer cops get away with it,” she added. “It’s organized crime.”",News/US news,"Her son died at the hands of Louisiana police.

2/5/2022,"The knock on the door came just before midnight on New Year’s Eve. Chloé Gardiner and her boyfriend were at home, but not alone. After a hard year, they had invited two friends over to see in 2021 with them, breaking strict rules in force in her area as the UK entered its second wave of the pandemic. “There were three carloads of police in the end,” says Gardiner, a 23-year-old care assistant from the small town of Portstewart in Northern Ireland. “And there were only four of us.” It was hardly a wild party, she says – they were just hanging out, listening to music and posting the odd picture to social media – and she doesn’t know who reported them; they weren’t being loud, and they have no close neighbours. They were fined £200 each for breaching Covid regulations, deducted automatically in her case from her wages. Gardiner, who works two jobs, says money went from both pay packets, and she is still trying to recoup £100 she thinks was wrongly deducted in the confusion.  Working in care, Gardiner had seen the consequences of Covid-19. Why did she take the risk? “At the beginning I adhered to all the rules, but the more things went on – it’s bad for your mental health, it’s tough trying to stay away from people you see in your everyday life anyway. And for something as simple as a hug … it was just nice to have people over for New Year.” Gardiner had never been in trouble with the police before, and initially felt bad about it. But when the health secretary, Matt Hancock, resigned the following summer after being caught kissing an aide, guilt turned to something more like indignation, followed by fury when stories of boozy lockdown parties in Downing Street began to surface. “It’s awful, what’s now coming out. It’s not just one or two. When their parties were going on, I was having to video-call families whose loved ones were on their deathbeds,” she says. “How can we live by the government’s rules if they can’t live with them themselves?” That question has reverberated through Westminster in recent weeks, as tales of a “bring-your-own-booze” party in the Downing Street garden and Friday night “wine-time” sessions dripped out. Individual liberties have been curtailed to a previously unimaginable degree during the pandemic – and sometimes huge sacrifices have been made. Mourners avoided hugging each other at funerals; mothers gave birth alone; and for months on end millions of Britons left their homes only for essential errands such as exercising and buying food. Most complied, with a YouGov poll in 2020 finding 68% of Britons claimed to have done everything asked of them. But one in four didn’t – numbers likely to have risen as the pandemic wore on. Now the realisation that those who set the rules may have repeatedly broken them is casting the last two years in a different light, prompting difficult questions about freedom, trust in government, and the power of the state. By last December, police in England and Wales had issued 118,963 fines for breaking Covid regulations – anything from meeting one friend when socialising was banned, through to staging illegal raves, with fines ranging from £100 for minor infractions to £10,000 for the most egregious, and sometimes more in cases of late payment. In Northern Ireland, police issued more than 8,000 fines over the year to March 2021, and Scottish police handed out more than 12,843 in the year to August 2021. Over half of all Covid fines were issued during the lockdown between January and March 2021, when schools, pubs, offices and restaurants shut once again, and the initial novelty of clapping for the NHS gave way for some to frustration, deepening financial hardship and plummeting mental health. As so few cases reached trial, it’s not always clear what drove the rule-breakers (fixed penalty notices, or FPNs, are processed like speeding fines, usually without a defendant going to court). A handful of sad cases have made headlines, from the Somerset care worker fined for eating a sandwich in her car, post-shift, at a beauty spot (deemed a non-essential journey) to a lonely 66-year-old pensioner from London who met friends at his allotment as he picked greens for supper. Not every case, however, elicits such sympathy. In London, 31 police officers responsible for enforcing Covid laws were fined for breaking them to get haircuts. Three students in Norwich were each fined £10,000 for throwing a house party for 100 people. And on the day the Queen buried her husband of 70 years, sitting alone in her funeral pew, a 27-year-old Londoner named Vianna McKenzie-Bramble marked her birthday with a marquee, a bouncy castle and around 60 guests gathering outside her flat. What she couldn’t have known was that hours earlier Downing Street staff had also hosted two illicit leaving bashes, reportedly merging into one drunken gathering. Although Boris Johnson wasn’t present, No 10 would later apologise to the Queen. Police called out to break up McKenzie-Bramble’s party in Victoria Park, London, found the grass littered with empty bottles and nitrous oxide canisters. Over at Downing Street, there was reportedly dancing in the basement and someone broke a swing used by Johnson’s toddler son. While she was fined £12,000, the Downing Street party remained a secret for eight months, despite the presence of a 24-hour police guard outside No 10. For many who suffered traumatic lockdowns and stuck to the rules, the thought of Downing Street aides swigging gin in the garden may be enraging. Yet some Britons caught partying during lockdown seem almost as infuriated by the idea of those in power getting away with what they were punished for doing. If the pandemic once divided Britons into rule-takers and rule-breakers, the partygate scandal may have briefly reunited them in anger. There is a stretch of boggy marshland, on the fringes of the London suburb of Edmonton, that could have been made for illegal parties. Bordering an area where fly-tippers dump old sofas, it’s close enough to a busy road to mask the sound from the DJ decks, but over three miles from nearby houses. When police were called to this wasteland on 30 May last year, they found around 500 people who had been raving all night and into the morning, in defiance of Covid rules limiting outdoor gatherings to 30 people. Party organiser Jayden Elworthy, a DJ, actor and aspiring model from London, claimed to be “saving lives on the dancefloor” and said of Covid that “we are past that now”, according to the officers’ testimony to court. In his absence, Westminster magistrates fined him the maximum allowable under coronavirus law – £10,000, rising to £12,000 for failing to pay a fixed penalty notice promptly. Over the phone from Barcelona, where he is currently working, Elworthy is initially defiant. When he organised the rave, he says, Ascot racecourse was preparing to welcome thousands of racegoers, and football crowds would soon be gathering to watch the Euros. “No one cared. Everyone was mixing,” he says. “I’m not going to have people govern me when firstly they don’t even abide by their own governance, and secondly that governance is flawed.” Elworthy, who has had Covid twice, agrees there was a “limited necessity” for restrictions to stop it spreading, but is suspicious of the science. He spends some time expounding on a complex conspiracy theory popular online, involving US public health officials supposedly paying a Chinese lab to make the virus, alongside various plots he believes were covered up by the mainstream media. His private rule of thumb, he says, was that partying was acceptable if the R rate of the virus was under one. But the bravado crumbles when it comes to the fine. He can’t pay, he says, and seems paralysed thinking about it. “I don’t know what to do. I haven’t even appealed it. I just prioritise everything else in my life instead.” The clubbing and events sector in which Elworthy earns a living was the first to be shut down and the last to be reopened in successive lockdowns. He runs a tech company on the side, but still had to claim universal credit at times, and has friends who lost everything; others, he says, were key workers risking infection every time they went to work, who felt they had little left to lose by mingling socially, too. “For some it was easy – you could stay at home and avoid it. But some were forced out into the wilderness of Covid, so then what’s the point of staying in when your mental health is at risk? There were a couple of DJs who killed themselves because overnight they had nothing – no career, no life.” The parties, he insists, were about “saving people from loneliness, depression, drug abuse. I had friends calling me, crying, saying, ‘I don’t know what to do, I feel like a fish in a fishbowl; I go to work, I come back, I’ve already had Covid and I’m sat in my room going crazy.’ It’s breaking the law to even say, ‘Come over.’” After his court case was reported in the press, Elworthy got some abuse online. But he thinks the mood changed when the tales from No 10 tumbled out. “No one blames me now,” he says. “Everyone’s like, ‘So why were we staying at home, then?’” Jack started his biology degree in autumn 2020, just as the second Covid wave was gathering force. He had no face-to-face teaching for his first year at University College London and was largely confined to halls, sharing a flat with five strangers he didn’t get on with. After the country locked down again on 5 January 2021, he says, police patrolled the halls alongside university guards, making students stick to their rooms. At 19, Jack wasn’t afraid of catching the virus, but he did fear the financial consequences of breaking lockdown. “A friend had a party and he got fined £1,800; his mum ended up taking a loan out to pay for it. It doesn’t seem right, the pressure that was put on us – sit in your room and be really depressed, or leave the room and financially cripple yourself. You don’t want to harm anyone by giving them Covid, but you don’t want to end up wasting your life away in a room, either.” So one February night, Jack sneaked upstairs to see friends. There were seven of them in a room, he says, keeping quiet so as not to attract attention. But they were caught by security guards and each fined £100. “What we were doing was obviously wrong, but I could justify it to myself in the sense that we weren’t seeing anyone who was vulnerable – it was all in the same building, and I was with people I’d been seeing every day just before lockdown,” he says. “Even though breaking the rules is obviously not a good thing, it’s interesting that the students who didn’t break the rules noticeably struggled to fit in. A lot of them are currently living alone or have mental health issues.” Will, now in his second year at university in Cardiff, also succumbed to temptation after a frustrating year of cancelled A-levels and staying in. “I had spent my whole life at school and then three months before my final exams it was like, ‘Nope, see you later.’ We never had a prom or a leavers’ ball. Then we got here and it was: ‘Stay put, don’t go to lectures,’” he recalls. Learning moved online, and all five of his student housemates dropped out of university; rattling round the house on his own, he threw one illicit lockdown party without getting caught, emboldening him to try again last March. This time, with around 100 guests and music blaring out, the party was broken up by campus security. His friends vanished quickly, leaving, as Will puts it, “just me, in my now really dirty house”. Given the size of the party and the fact that it was his house, Will was warned he could be fined up to £6,000. What possessed him? “Being students, you feel a little bit – not invulnerable, but we were surrounded by each other. We weren’t going into lectures, we weren’t going to give it to our elderly professors,” he says. After a meeting convened between police and his university to settle several outstanding student cases, Will escaped with a £30 fine and a warning. He says of the Downing Street party allegations: “It’s so bizarre, I don’t even really know how to process it. I only got fined £30, and my mum was nice enough to pay it, but there will have been people who got a £6,000 fine who are students, who are in debt, yet the people at the top of the country are doing this.” Harry, a 22-year-old final-year student in Newcastle who was also fined after being caught socialising at another student house, feels differently. Some of his friends racked up fines of up to £800, yet they felt it was worth the risk when nightclubs were closed: “The first time you got caught it was £100, and we were probably saving that on entrance fees and drinks.” Harry voted Conservative at the last election, and takes an equally relaxed view of Johnson’s conduct. “You’ve got a few young spads and it’s their social life – I kind of think of these people as the weird kids at school [about whom] you thought, ‘I hope they never go into politics’ and they probably don’t have much of a life outside work. Boris Johnson wasn’t elected to be a cookie-cutter Hugh Grant-type prime minister, was he?” Larissa Kennedy, president of the National Union of Students, argues that only a “very small minority” of students broke the rules, and often only because they were struggling emotionally. “I’ve spoken to people who had months of not seeing anyone, who were only going out once a day for their exercise and not talking to a living soul. Some of them had moved countries to come to the UK and study, only to be locked into a room.” But Jack, Will and Harry are typical lockdown-breakers in one sense, which is that they’re all young men. A study led by researchers at the University of Sheffield, part of a larger exercise examining everything from young people’s compliance with advice to wash their hands to their mental health during the pandemic, found that over half of men aged 19 to 24 admitted breaking Covid guidelines during the first lockdown in spring 2020. One in five men aged 19 to 21 reported being arrested, fined, warned or escorted home by police, compared with only one in 10 women that age. One explanation is that men were more likely to guess that their own friends wouldn’t comply with lockdown, encouraging them to rebel without fear of being judged for it. Dr Jilly Gibson-Miller, lecturer in psychology at Sheffield, explains over Zoom that young people’s willingness to take risks depends on how they perceive others who do it. “If they identify with that person, they’re more willing to take that risk. It boils down to social comparison,” she says. “They might see a person who followed the rules as more sensible or more grown up, but that’s not necessarily a cool thing.” Where older age groups saw rule-breakers as selfish or immature, the study found young men tended to see them as “cool” or “independent”. They also tended to underplay the dangers of Covid, says the study’s co-author, Dr Liat Levita. “I think they didn’t see the point of complying. When we asked questions such as, ‘How much risk are you to others?’, the males tended to underestimate it.” The study did, however, find links between compliance and mental health, with those feeling anxious more likely to obey the rules and those feeling depressed more likely to break them and seek out company. “Anxiety has a survival value,” says Levita, who argues that while many young people described feeling anxious during the pandemic, that may have been a healthy reaction, so long as that anxiety was not crippling. “But depression is interesting, in terms of how low mood affects your behaviour. You’re less likely to engage with anything, you have very low motivations – with that kind of diagnosis, we did find people struggled more in adhering to the guidelines.” Nonetheless, Levita and Gibson-Miller argue that young people shouldn’t be seen as having behaved recklessly and that, if anything, it’s surprising so many complied with unprecedented curbs on their freedom. “They didn’t wash their hands so well. Sometimes, they broke the rules. But they did almost everything we asked of them, without going out into the streets and creating anarchy and throwing bottles around and rioting,” Levita says. And while those aged between 18 and 29 received over half of fines issued up to March 2021, plenty of other recipients were arguably old enough to know better. Harriet is a 54-year-old teacher from Hampshire, who followed the rules religiously through the first lockdown. But by December 2020, she was growing restless. A keen wild swimmer, she drove to the shingle beach at Hill Head near Portsmouth with two female friends for a bracing dip between Christmas and New Year, even though the restrictions in force allowed for meeting only one person outside her household to exercise. Heading into the chilly water, they bumped into two more swimmers they knew. The women were towelling off afterwards when a policeman, who she suspects was tipped off by another beachgoer, approached. “I was so embarrassed I just pulled my towel over my head,” she admits. “He said, ‘Are you part of the same household?’ and there was this silence that lasted a bit too long – do you tell the truth or lie? But being the good citizens we are, we told the truth.” The women apologised profusely and were relieved when, instead of fining them, the officer merely warned them not to do it again. As a teacher, Harriet arguably risked jeopardising her professional reputation by breaking the law. What possessed her? “We were doing something that, in our view, we had risk-assessed, that was in a bit of a grey area – you were allowed to meet one other person outside; we were just a bit on the edge of that,” she says. “We had the windows open and we were fully masked in the car.” It felt odd, she adds, that she was allowed to work all day with hundreds of potentially infectious children, yet she was barred from meeting friends. The rollout of the longed-for Covid vaccine that winter may have encouraged a surprising number of older Britons to drop their guard. The Office for National Statistics found that almost half of over-80s met someone from outside their household or bubble indoors after their first jab, and given the timing of vaccinations, many must have breached the January to March lockdown to do so. After months in hiding, seeing their grandchildren only over FaceTime, perhaps loneliness got the better of some. From the beginning, police have had some discretion to exercise compassion in such circumstances, via a strategy allowing them to explain and warn lockdown-breakers rather than leap to penalty notices. But even compassion can have its downsides, if exercised disproportionately in favour of some groups over others. Research published last year by the human rights pressure group Liberty found people of colour were 54% more likely to be fined for breaching Covid laws than white people, reflecting concerns that “existing patterns about the policing of certain communities would be replicated and exacerbated” by an enforcement-led approach to lockdown, as its policy and campaigns officer Jun Pang puts it. Alternative measures such as improving sick pay and halting evictions could, she argues, have been used to help low earners comply. Whether or not they were more likely to break the rules, the poor were arguably disproportionately likely to get caught. Hiding a party is easier in a remote country house – or a bomb-proofed building sealed off from the public road, like No 10 – than an inner-city flat with paper-thin walls. Flat-dwellers with no outside space, meeting in parks for illicit beers, were more visible to police patrols than homeowners smuggling guests into suburban gardens. Alba Kapoor, senior policy officer at the Runnymede Trust, meanwhile points out that ethnic minority Britons were disproportionately more likely to be living in overcrowded and pressured conditions when lockdown hit. “For us, the key takeaway is that the extension of police powers in this way will always have a disproportionate impact on BAME groups and on black men in particular,” she says. And, she points out, all this unfolded just as an emerging Black Lives Matter movement was providing a new focus for old frustrations with the criminal justice system. In January 2021, Bianca Ali was getting ready for a protest marking the death in police custody of a black man, Mohamud Hassan, when two police vans pulled up outside her Cardiff flat. “I live alone and I’m 5ft 2in – I’m not a threat,” says Ali, 30, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter Cardiff Community. “They were banging on my front door saying that they knew I was in there – I didn’t open the door, I didn’t know what could happen to me. It was a really intimidating situation.” Ali was warned to expect a fine for organising a protest gathering in lockdown, although she insists she wasn’t the organiser. It didn’t stop her joining the socially distanced protest outside Cardiff Bay police station, which lasted four days. “I was there for something bigger than me. If they want to give me a fine, it’s not going to stop me protesting about the death of a black person,” she says now. Ali was handed a £500 fine, but refused to pay, triggering a stressful eight-month legal battle that ended last autumn with police dropping the prosecution. Nonetheless, she was shaken by the process. “I suffer from anxiety, and my anxiety went through the roof,” she says. “Even now, if I walk from my house to my mum’s house, I have to pass the police station, and my stomach turns over. It’s a horrible feeling, especially on evenings like this when it’s dark. Who’s going to believe me, a young black woman from a rough area of Cardiff, against the police?” Ali was represented by Patrick Ormerod, a solicitor with the London firm Bindmans, who argued that she was exercising her human rights in protesting, and thus had a reasonable excuse for breaching lockdown. Having also handled cases of students threatened with £10,000 fines for throwing parties in which the legislation turned out to have been misapplied, Ormerod argues a straightforward mechanism for appealing Covid fines is urgently needed. “I hope the Covid public inquiry will look at what could have been done differently with the criminal justice response to the pandemic. Jacob Rees-Mogg [the leader of the Commons] has suggested we should look at whether the restrictions were proportionate, but I think the inquiry should also look at how so many people were criminalised when they probably weren’t guilty of the offences,” he says, pointing out that for those who can’t afford lawyers, the prospect of challenging fines in court is daunting. That was true for Ali Lawrence, a musician and music teacher from York who for decades has supplemented his living by busking. During the first summer of the pandemic, when the rules relaxed and restaurants were buzzing with “eat out to help out”, he managed to get out and play. But by March 2021, having earned almost nothing in three months and exhausted a government support grant, he was poring over the regulations trying to establish whether busking was allowed. “During the 18 months of restrictions, nearly every musician was out of work. It was a tough time,” he says. “There wasn’t really any clear explanation in the rules – the only thing it said was that if you couldn’t work from home, you could travel to your place of work. And cases like mine are a business.” When he settled down at his piano in a busy York square, he took a copy of the regulations and a photocopy of his tax return to show music was his job, but was nonetheless told to stop by a police officer because he was “drawing an audience”. (He admits it may not have helped that when the officers approached his busking partner, Karl Mullen, the latter started playing the Laurel and Hardy theme tune on the piano.) Footage uploaded to YouTube from a bystander’s mobile phone shows a masked Lawrence at his piano and curious shoppers skirting round him, while a passerby observes that “there’s more people in Morrisons than there are here”. North Yorkshire police handed him a £200 fine. Lawrence didn’t want to pay up for what he thought didn’t constitute an illegal gathering, but feared getting a criminal record if he went to court and lost. “So I caved in. But I felt awful, because I thought, ‘Well, I haven’t done anything wrong – I’m just trying to work.’” (North Yorkshire police subsequently said in a statement that his fine was for “contravening an officer’s instructions” to stop.) While Lawrence views Johnson’s so-called “work events” in Downing Street as “just what you expect” of politicians, his experiences have changed the way he feels about the police. He remains anxious about getting into trouble, and recently when he was asked to move on while busking in a nearby market town, he gave in for fear of another fine. He is closely following the progress through parliament of the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill, which contains controversial new restrictions on protest. “I’m worried that we’re losing all our freedoms. It’s in the back of my mind that we had almost a bit of a police state last year.” Over the last two years the police have been visible in everyday lives as never before: patrolling parks, interrogating dog walkers at beauty spots, breaking up backyard barbecues. And for some who haven’t previously experienced the sharp end of the law, that may have been a wakeup call. The NUS’s Larissa Kennedy thinks the pandemic may have shaped young people’s feelings about the police, citing a resurgence of “cops off campus” campaigns fuelled by resentment at the heavy security presence during lockdown – including instances of black students being stopped and challenged when trying to get into their own halls. Liberty’s Jun Pang, meanwhile, wonders whether living under this level of surveillance may prompt some Britons who hadn’t previously been in trouble with the police to empathise more with minority communities. “It’s really interesting, hearing people talk about their first interactions with the police. People might describe it as quite arbitrary or say they don’t understand what’s going on. Well, something we have been trying to say from the beginning is that lots of communities experience arbitrary policing because of things like racism and discrimination; lots of people have interactions with the police that don’t seem to make any sense. I think this is a really interesting moment.” If all goes to plan, and the government lifts all pandemic restrictions in March, the era of Covid fines will be over. But long after memories of being banned from sitting on a park bench have faded, some will still be quietly paying off those fines. And for those like Jack, who broke the law when they were young and lonely, the corrosive feeling that it’s one rule for the governed and another for the government lingers. “They were doing it because they think they’re above the law, and they are above the law, really,” he says of parties at No 10. “The police weren’t patrolling Downing Street, they weren’t checking if those people were in groups of six. They didn’t do that for the MPs – they did it for students. But if anything, maybe it should have been the other way round.”",News/World news,‘We had two people over – then the police turned up’: how do Covid rule-breakers feel about partygate?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/05/downing-street-parties-how-covid-rule-breakers-feel-now
2/5/2022,"Last year was a breakthrough time for UFOs, as a landmark government report prompted the possibility of extraterrestrial visitors to finally be taken seriously by everyone from senators, to a former president, to the Pentagon. But 2022 could be even more profound, experts say, as the clamor for UFO disclosure and discovery continues to grow, and as new scientific projects bring us closer than ever to – potentially – discovering non-Earth life.  In June, the Pentagon released a highly anticipated report on unexplained aerial phenomena (UAP), the now preferred nomenclature by some in the extraterrestrial community, which found more than 140 instances of UAPs that could not be explained. The report came after leaked military footage documented seemingly otherworldly happenings in the sky, and after testimony from navy pilots helped to somewhat destigmatize a subject that has long been defined by conspiracy theories and dubious sightings. All in all, the newly sincere approach to UFOs has longtime sky-watchers excited. “I’m confident that 2022 is going to be a seismic year for UFOs,” said Nick Pope, who spent the early 1990s investigating UFOs for the British ministry of defence. In Congress, where a bipartisan group of senators has been pushing for years for the government to release more information on UFOs, and from the US defense department and intelligence community, Pope said he senses “a genuine desire to grip the issue”. “I think we’ll see congressional hearings on UFOs,” Pope said. “I also think we’ll see the release of more US military photos and videos of UFOs, and associated documents. Some of this may come via whistleblowers, but much of it may be released by the government itself, either proactively, or in response to requests under the Freedom of Information Act. “Finally, I think we’ll see more high-calibre witnesses coming forward, including commercial airline pilots, military aircrew, radar operators, and intelligence officers with direct knowledge of this subject.” It was a group of pilots who brought the issue to the fore in 2021. In a breakthrough interview with 60 Minutes, members of the US Navy lined up to recall their experiences of encountering UFOs on America’s coasts. It happened so frequently that the encounters became commonplace, Ryan Graves, a retired navy pilot, told the CBS show. “Every day,” Graves said. “Every day for at least a couple years.” For years, pilots had refused to share tales of their UFO experiences, worried of being labeled kooks or being passed over for promotion. The account of the navy pilots was given credibility, however, by leaked military footage which showed an oval flying object near a US navy ship off San Diego, and separate videos which showed triangular-shaped objects buzzing around in the sky. The US government’s UFO report, released in June 2021, fueled more interest. The Pentagon studied 144 incidents reported by military pilots between 2004 and 2021 in preparing the report. Officials were able to explain one of the incidents – it was a balloon – but the rest remain a mystery. Since then the Pentagon, pushed by US senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Marco Rubio, has launched a new office for reporting and analyzing UFO reports, although some in the UFO community suspect the government to be less than forthcoming with its findings. Still, as the clamor for information has grown, so has interest from the scientific community, and in 2022 a slew of new projects will launch, specifically aimed at detecting alien life. Avi Loeb, the Frank B Baird Jr professor of science at Harvard University, is behind one of those. He is the head of the Galileo Project, which aims to establish a network of sophisticated telescopes which will scan the skies for extraterrestrial objects. The privately funded project, which involves more than 100 scientists, is building its first telescope system on the roof of the Harvard college observatory, and it will begin operating this summer. Loeb plans to make the projects’ findings publicly available. The telescope will use infra-red cameras to take 24/7 video of the sky, and is equipped with a radio sensor, an audio sensor and a magnetometer to detect non-visual objects. A computer will use artificial intelligence to analyze the data, ignoring objects like birds, drones, planes, and meteors, and paying extra attention to any objects “that are not human-made”, Loeb said. “We’re taking a road not taken so there may be low hanging fruit, that nobody else picked because it was not taken,” Loeb said. For all that UFO research may be becoming destigmatized, Loeb said the field is still looked down upon by some astrophysicists and other academics, which can turn off young scientists. “I really want the next generation to be free to discuss it, and for it to become part of the mainstream,” Loeb said. “My hope is that by getting a high resolution image of something unusual, or finding evidence for it, which is quite possible in the coming year or two, we will change it.” The Galileo Project also hopes to use data collected by Planet Labs, which uses a fleet of miniature satellites to image the entire Earth once a day. By both looking up and down, the likelihood of discovery is increased. Collaboration is important, Loeb said, as the search for UFOs to date has been quixotic at best. But those who claim the lack of evidence of extraterrestrials means that alien life does not exist are misguided, Loeb said. “It’s just like a fisherman on the beach, looking at the ocean, saying: ‘Where are all the fish? I don’t see anything?’” he said. “And obviously if you don’t use a fishing net you will not find anything.” Long-time space enthusiasts are also hopeful about the impact of the James Webb space telescope, the largest and most powerful of its kind, which Nasa launched in December 2021. When it begins operating this summer, the Webb telescope will enable astronomers to scan the skies, peering back to when the universe was first beginning to form, as well as help study exo-planets: worlds that circle other suns. These concerted efforts could make 2022 “a banner year”, Leonard David, author of Moon Rush: the New Space Race, and a journalist who has been reporting on the space industry for more than five decades, said. “It’s a great time to be alive. The bottom line is something’s coming. You can’t have that many people doing that much research and come up dry,” David said. “At some point we’re going to have a confluence of scientific data that supports the likelihood that we’re a pretty mundane place here on earth, and there’s a lot of alien civilizations that are out there. “We’ve got to start thinking we’re not alone. It’s: how crowded is it up there?” A frequent backdrop to any discussion of alien life is how it would affect humans here on earth. Some speculate that religions could be shaken to their core, or that there could be a mass existential crisis. David said that extraterrestrials, however, could be aware of us and be deliberately ignoring our planet, which would represent an equally devastating blow to the human sense of self-importance. “I don’t know exactly where the Earth fits in and why we would be on the receiving end of any attention,” he said. “We could be the dolts of the universe.”",News/World news,‘Something’s coming’: is America finally ready to take UFOs seriously?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/05/ufos-america-aliens-government-report
2/5/2022,"Campaigners in Cardiff are calling for the police and other authorities to do more to protect LGBTQ+ people after it emerged the sadistic homophobic murder of a consultant psychiatrist was only one of a spate of hate crimes recorded at the time. A vigil is to be held near Bute Park in the city on Sunday after a 17-year-old girl and two men were found guilty of murdering Dr Gary Jenkins by beating him and stamping on his head for 15 minutes in the early hours of a morning in July last year.  Following the conclusion of the trial, there will be a vigil in memory of Dr Gary Jenkins on Sunday at 17:30 on the steps of the National Museum. pic.twitter.com/2j4qPGhSPa There has been an outpouring of grief and concern from the LGBTQ+ community in Wales, with members saying they have experienced an increase in aggression over the past two years, and some pointing out that Jenkins’ murder was an example of a string of hate crimes that coincided with release from lockdown. During the attack and robbery in July, Jenkins, a bisexual man, was subject to homophobic abuse. Afterwards, Dionne Timms-Williams, who was 16 at the time, said: “I needed that.” It emerged after the three were found guilty of murder that one of the killers, Lee Strickland, 36, had targeted men in the park before. Iestyn Wyn, the campaigns, policy and research manager at Stonewall Cymru, said the case had provoked “intense horror”. “There’s a sense of fear within the LGBTQ+ community that there is an increase in prejudice and hate and negative attitudes,” he said. Wyn emphasised the problem was a global rather than a Cardiff issue. “Some people feel able at the moment to say what they want to whoever they want. For decades we’ve lived in a society where if you hold beliefs that are dangerous or harmful, you wouldn’t express that. It’s become clear that people feel they are able to express their hatred of people who are different. “We need a frank and open conversation about what can be done by those who have responsibility for our safety. There needs to be a UK-wide conversation.” Homophobic and transphobic hate crime recorded by police in the UK rose sharply after lockdown restrictions were eased. The highest number of violent sexual orientation hate crimes in a calendar month recorded by South Wales police between the start of 2019 and August 2021 was July 2021 (153), according to analysis from the PA news agency. A few weeks before Jenkins was attacked, student Yang Wu, 27, was left with facial injuries after a homophobic attack on a road close to the park. In September a man carried out a homophobic attack on two other men in the Splott area of the city and posters advertising an LGBTQ+ festival were pulled down. Matthew Williams, professor of criminology at Cardiff University, said there was emerging evidence that as the world emerged from lockdowns there were “flashpoints” of violence. Yan White, creator of the Queer Emporium in Cardiff, which brings together a string of LGBTQ+ businesses, said: “The police need to have a look at how they strategise in terms of protecting vulnerable people.” He said other forces had programmes to keep people who meet in places like Bute Park safe. “There’s no equivalent here.” Cardiff councillor Ashley Lister, who campaigns on LGBTQ+ issues, said: “We don’t want kneejerk reactions. We have to work with the community and the authorities about engaging to improve the inclusivity for the city, not to create barriers. It’s sickening in 2022 we’re organising a vigil for a man who was brutally murdered over his sexuality. It’s scary.” Adam Price, the leader of Plaid Cymru, said the murder had sent shock waves through the LGBTQ+ community but said it was “an all too familiar feeling”, adding: “Until the voices and experiences of LGBTQ+ people are heard and affirmed across society, there will continue to be hate crime. The work that needs to be done has to start in schools, it’s got to be in workplaces and it needs to be across all of society.” The Cardiff-based lesbian activist Lisa Power said the city had used to be known as one of the safest for LGBTQ+ people. “But it’s going backwards. We need better education in schools, we need to support people to challenge hate speech. Allowing people to talk trash to people about their gender, sexuality or ethnic origin can end in terrible crimes like this.” A Welsh government spokesperson said: “What we saw in July 2021 was a homophobic attack in the heart of our capital. It is a cruel reminder that while we have made great strides in the campaign for equality, we still have a very long way to go.” South Wales police said it was working to make Bute Park safe. A spokesperson said: “South Wales police has worked with the local authority and Bute Park management to survey Bute Park, assess what additional measures may be instigated in the park and as a result there have been agreed improvements in CCTV and lighting, park assess and patrols from the police and partners to prevent and detect crime.” It said it had launched a range of initiatives ranging from plain clothes officers patrolling the centre at night to protect vulnerable people and student safety campaigns. The spokesman added: “Hate crime has always been a priority for South Wales police. Every day officers work with the community and local representative groups to ensure that the rights of people from all backgrounds, races and cultures, regardless of their circumstances are upheld.” ",News/World news,Calls for protection of LGBTQ+ people after spate of hate crimes in Cardiff,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/05/calls-for-protection-of-lgbtq-people-after-spate-of-hate-crimes-in-cardiff
