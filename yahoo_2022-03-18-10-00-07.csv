3/18/2022,"TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Wednesday announced plans to fully lift coronavirus restrictions on March 21 as new infections driven by the highly contagious omicron variant slow. The COVID-19 restrictions currently in place in 18 prefectures, including the Tokyo area, will end on Monday as planned, Kishida said at a news conference on Wednesday, as his government seeks to cautiously expand consumer activity to help the badly hurt economy get back on track. “This will be a transitional period so that we can return to our normal daily lives as much as possible by taking maximum precautions,” Kishida said. It will be the first time Japan has been free of virus restrictions since early January. The plan will be formally adopted after an experts’ panel endorses it on Thursday. Daily caseloads have steadily declined in Japan in recent weeks after surging to new highs exceeding 100,000 in early February. New cases have fallen by about half. The lifting of restrictions will allow more domestic travel, as well as parties and larger gatherings for people with vaccination records and negative virus tests, Kishida said. But Japan is not opening its border to foreign tourists yet. Kishida on Wednesday did not mention further easing of Japan’s border controls. His government has eased border restrictions by increasing the limit on daily new arrivals to 7,000 in order to allow in foreign scholars, students, business people and interns after criticisms from inside and outside Japan that locking them out is exclusionist and unscientific. While omicron causes mild symptoms in most people and the fatality rate remains low, the latest wave is the deadliest one so far in Japan because the total number of patients were many times higher than in earlier waves. Still, deaths in Japan total about 26,000 since the pandemic began two years ago, significantly lower than many other countries. Most victims were elderly patients whose underlying illnesses rapidly worsened after contracting the virus, experts said. Kishida has faced criticism that he delayed booster shots until all municipalities were ready, allowing the virus to quickly spread in the country. His government has since opened mass inoculation centers to speed up the booster program. About 72% of people aged 65 or older have received their third jabs, but overall booster vaccines have reached only one-third of the population. Experts urge caution after the lifting of restrictions due to the possibility of a resurgence of infections. A subvariant of omicron is gradually replacing the primary strain around the country. In some areas, hospital bed occupancy rates still exceed 50%, and oral antiviral pills are not reaching as many people as expected. Although Kishida's government has pledged to secure millions of doses of the two imported oral pills, they are not widely used. One is rather large and hard to swallow, and another cannot be combined with many other drugs. The ongoing COVID-19 restrictions are largely limited to eateries, where shorter service hours are requested. The general public is also asked to work from home and avoid parties and large events, as well as to wear masks while in public places and follow other basic anti-virus measures.",World/Associated Press,Japan to fully lift COVID-19 restrictions as infections slow,https://news.yahoo.com/japan-fully-lift-covid-19-110909485.html
3/18/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia would achieve its goals in Ukraine and would not submit to what he called a Western attempt to achieve global dominance and dismember Russia. Putin said Russia was ready to discuss neutral status for Ukraine, three weeks into a war that has killed thousands of people and forced millions of Ukrainians to flee their homes. He said that what Russia calls its special military operation was ""going to plan"". In a televised speech to government ministers, Putin went further than before in acknowledging the pain that Western sanctions were inflicting on the economy, but insisted that Russia could withstand the blow. There was no sign of any softening in his bitter invective against the West and Ukraine. ""In the foreseeable future, it was possible that the pro-Nazi regime in Kyiv could have got its hands on weapons of mass destruction, and its target, of course, would have been Russia,"" Putin said. Putin has consistently described the democratically elected leaders of Ukraine as neo-Nazis bent on committing genocide against Russian-speakers in the east of the country - a line that the West denounces as baseless war propaganda. He said Western countries wanted to turn Russia into a ""weak dependent country; violate its territorial integrity; to dismember Russia in a way that suits them"". If the West thought that Russia would break down or back down, ""they don't know our history or our people"", Putin said on the 21st day of the war. ""Behind the hypocritical talk and today's actions of the so-called collective West are hostile geopolitical goals. They just don't want a strong and sovereign Russia."" He said Russia was ready to discuss Ukraine's neutral status in talks: ""The question of principle for our country and its future – the neutral status of Ukraine, its demilitarisation, and its denazification – we were ready and we are ready to discuss as part of negotiations."" Ukraine says it is willing to negotiate to end the war but will not surrender or accept Russian ultimatums. In his most explicit acknowledgment of the pain inflicted by Western sanctions, Putin said inflation and unemployment would rise, and structural changes to the economy would be needed. But he promised support to families with children. He said the West had in effect declared Russia in default as part of its sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine, but that the conflict had been only a pretext for the West to impose those sanctions. ""The West doesn't even bother to hide that their aim is to damage the entire Russian economy, every Russian,"" Putin said.

 Japan said on Thursday it spotted four Russian amphibious ships in waters close to its shores on Wednesday. The Japanese military said the four ships sailed in the Tsuruga Strait that separates Japan's Honshu island and Hokkaido island, an unusual move for Russia, Reuters reported. The ships are able to hold military equipment, including tanks, and hundreds of troops. Japan's defense ministry released pictures of the ships that appeared to have military trucks on at least one of them, according to Reuters. When a defense ministry spokesperson was asked if the equipment could be going to Ukraine, he said ""it is possible."" Russia's invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands and destroyed hundreds of buildings over the past three weeks. Russia has targeted hospitals, movie theaters and residential buildings, although the Kremlin denies doing so. Ukrainian officials have decried alleged Russian war crimes and continue to push for a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Western countries have resisted the move but have provided military aid to Ukraine to defend its country. Russia continues to falsely claim their presence in Ukraine is a ""special military operation"" to liberate the people from a ""neo-Nazi"" government. More than 3 million Ukrainians have been displaced due to the fighting.",World/The Hill,Japan says it spotted Russian amphibious ships heading toward Europe,https://news.yahoo.com/japan-says-spotted-russian-amphibious-123906081.html
3/18/2022,"Russian President Vladimir Putin could be feeling trapped — and despite his public statements, he can't just pretend that everything is going OK in Ukraine, where his troops have so far failed to capture the capital, Kyiv, said Jack Barsky, a former KGB agent and the author of ""Deep Undercover: My Secret Life and Tangled Alliances as a KGB Spy in America."" Born Albrecht Dittrich in East Germany and recruited by the KGB to spy on the U.S. during the Cold War, Barsky stayed in the U.S. after the fall of the Soviet Union and worked with U.S. intelligence after he was exposed as a former sleeper agent. Barsky told CBS News' Lana Zak that the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 was a formative moment for Putin, who was then a mid-level KGB officer. As protesters gathered outside the office where he was stationed in Dresden, in East Germany, Putin was told Moscow was silent. Putin ""went from being a member of the most powerful organization, living the good life in East Germany, to somebody who was completely helpless, defending that position. I think that left a deep impression on him and it motivated him to rebuild — not necessarily the Soviet Union, but greater Russia. This is what he is after,"" Barsky said. Barsky told CBS News that in other wars, Putin sought to escalate the conflict — and if the pattern holds, will go after more civilian targets. ""He doesn't really care as much for the suffering of the Russian people. He's lashing out against his own people,"" Barsky said. The Russian leader has ""a tight grip on power,"" Barksy said. ""As long as he satisfies his inner circle — the folks that are directly supporting him — he doesn't have much to fear."" While a military revolt could be a potential long-term scenario, Barsky said, right now ""he is very well protected."" ""Assuming that he can survive this, assuming there isn't a sort of coup against him — so long term, he'll be in trouble if this keeps going like this, if more soldiers keep dying. He'll have an Afghanistan on his hands,"" said Barsky. Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in late 1979, toppling the Afghan leader and kicking off a nearly decade-long conflict with the mujahideen. ""And as you know, Afghanistan was the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union — and Ukraine may become the beginning of the end of Putin as a dictator.""

3/18/2022,"China has accused Taiwan of using Ukraine for its own political advantage as the self-governed island delivers a new round of aid for refugees this week.

After an initial donation of $3.5 million, Taiwan is sending another $11.5 million to help displaced Ukrainians, its Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on Tuesday. Earlier this month, President Tsai Ing-wen, Vice President William Lai and Premier Su Tseng-chang each pledged a month’s salary to donate to Ukrainian refugees.

Alongside government aid, the Taiwanese people have already donated critical supplies and more than $21.2 million to Ukraine, Tsai tweeted on Tuesday. They have also held protests in a show of solidarity.
 


China, on the other hand, pledged to donate $784,000 to Ukraine last week – the East Asian country’s first publicly announced form of aid since Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24. However, Beijing has refused to condemn Moscow for its actions and has yet to label the crisis as an invasion.

At a press briefing in Beijing on Wednesday, Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO), criticized Taiwan for sending aid to Ukraine and imposing economic sanctions against Russia.

“The Democratic Progressive Party authorities are using the Ukraine issue to validate their existence and piggyback on a hot issue, taking advantage of others’ difficulties,” Zhu told reporters. “Their attempts to incite confrontation and create hostility through political manipulation will not succeed.”

 

Taiwan first announced its intention to join “democratic countries” in imposing sanctions against Russia on Feb. 25. Aside from strictly reviewing exports to Moscow — which amounted to $1.3 billion in 2021, or 0.76% of outbound sales — it is not clear exactly how Taipei plans to impact the Russian economy.

On Monday, China said Taiwan “has only itself to blame” if Russia imposes its own sanctions against the island. Taipei receives coal, petroleum, aluminum, iron and non-alloy steel semi-finished products from Moscow, but those imports reportedly account for less than 1% of the island’s total foreign trade.

“As to why Taiwan is on the list, the answer is clear to all. If Taiwan is sanctioned, it has only itself to blame,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said of the island, which made the Kremlin’s list of “unfriendly” countries and territories last week.

Taiwan has yet to respond to China’s latest allegation. Meanwhile, Russia has yet to impose sanctions on the island, and Russian forces have continued attacks on Ukrainian cities. On Wednesday, one resident was killed and three were injured by rocket debris in Kyiv, while hundreds reportedly fled a theater in Mariupol after it was bombed.
