2/3/2022,"There is perhaps no better way to see the absolute pinnacle of human athletic abilities than by watching the Olympics. But at the Winter Games this year – and at almost all professional sporting events – you rarely see a competitor over 40 years old and almost never see a single athlete over 50. This is because with every additional year spent on Earth, bodies age and muscles don’t respond to exercise the same as they used to. I lead a team of scientists who study the health benefits of exercise, strength training and diet in older people. We investigate how older people respond to exercise and try to understand the underlying biological mechanisms that cause muscles to increase in size and strength after resistance or strength training. Old and young people build muscle in the same way. But as you age, many of the biological processes that turn exercise into muscle become less effective. This makes it harder for older people to build strength but also makes it that much more important for everyone to continue exercising as they age. The exercise I study is the type that makes you stronger. Strength training includes exercises like pushups and situps, but also weightlifting and resistance training using bands or workout machines. When you do strength training, over time, exercises that at first felt difficult become easier as your muscles increase in strength and size – a process called hypertrophy. Bigger muscles simply have larger muscle fibers and cells, and this allows you to lift heavier weights. As you keep working out, you can continue to increase the difficulty or weight of the exercises as your muscles get bigger and stronger. It is easy to see that working out makes muscles bigger, but what is actually happening to the cells as muscles increase in strength and size in response to resistance training? Any time you move your body, you are doing so by shortening and pulling with your muscles – a process called contraction. This is how muscles spend energy to generate force and produce movement. Every time you contract a muscle – especially when you have to work hard to do the contraction, like when lifting weights – the action causes changes to the levels of various chemicals in your muscles. In addition to the chemical changes, there are also specialized receptors on the surface of muscle cells that detect when you move a muscle, generate force or otherwise alter the biochemical machinery within a muscle. In a healthy young person, when these chemical and mechanical sensory systems detect muscle movement, they turn on a number of specialized chemical pathways within the muscle. These pathways in turn trigger the production of more proteins that get incorporated into the muscle fibers and cause the muscle to increase in size. These cellular pathways also turn on genes that code for specific proteins in cells that make up the muscles contracting machinery. This activation of gene expression is a longer-term process, with genes being turned on or off for several hours after a single session of resistance exercise. The overall effect of these many exercise-induced changes is to cause your muscles to get bigger. While the basic biology of all people, young or old, is more or less the same, something is behind the lack of senior citizens in professional sports. So what changes in a person’s muscles as they age? What my colleagues and I have found in our research is that in young muscle, a little bit of exercise produces a strong signal for the many processes that trigger muscle growth. In older people’s muscles, by comparison, the signal telling muscles to grow is much weaker for a given amount of exercise. In a recent study, we wanted to see if the changes in signaling were accompanied by any changes in which genes – and how many of them – respond to exercise. Using a technique that allowed us to measure changes in thousands of genes in response to resistance exercise, we found that when younger men exercise, there are changes in the expression of more than 150 genes. When we looked at older men, we found changes in the expression of only 42 genes. This difference in gene expression seems to explain, at least partly, the more visible variation between how young and old people respond to strength training. When you put together all of the various molecular differences in how older adults respond to strength training, the result is that older people do not gain muscle mass as well as young people. But this reality should not discourage older people from exercising. If anything, it should encourage you to exercise more as you age. Exercise still remains one of the most important activities older adults can do for their health. The work my colleagues and I have done clearly shows that although the responses to training lessen with age, they are by no means reduced to zero. We showed that older adults with mobility problems who participate in a regular program of aerobic and resistance exercise can reduce their risk of becoming disabled by about 20%. We also found a similar 20% reduction in risk of becoming disabled among people who are already physically frail if they did the same workout program. While younger people may get stronger and build bigger muscles much faster than their older counterparts, older people still get incredibly valuable health benefits from exercise, including improved strength, physical function and reduced disability. So the next time you are sweating during a workout session, remember that you are building muscle strength that is vital to maintaining mobility and good health throughout a long life.

2/3/2022,"LONDON (AP) — Britain's Royal Air Force said Wednesday that it scrambled fighter jets in response to “unidentified aircraft” approaching the U.K. The Typhoon jets took off from British air force bases in Lossiemouth, northeast Scotland, and they were joined by a Voyager air-to-air refueling tanker launched from Oxfordshire, England. Authorities did not provide further details on the operation. The force routinely intercepts and monitors approaching aircraft. It has said that Russian military aircraft entering the the U.K.'s policed zone of international airspace can pose a hazard to other air users because they often do not talk to air traffic control. In November 2021, jets were launched in response to Russian strategic bombers. Officials said at the time the fighters escorted the Russian aircraft out of the “area of interest” and that the bombers did not enter U.K. airspace.",World/Associated Press,UK air force scrambles jets against 'unidentified aircraft',https://news.yahoo.com/uk-air-force-scrambles-jets-133603225.html
2/3/2022,"Police in California are reopening the 40-year-old case of a child found brutally murdered at a former U.S. Army post. Anne Sang Thi Pham was just 5 years-old when someone abducted her on her way to school, according to the Monterey Herald. On Jan. 21, 1982, the child insisted on walking by herself to her kindergarten class at the nearby Highland School while her mother stayed home. Her family lived only a few blocks away from her elementary school, according to police. Army investigators found her body in the brush two days later at Fort Ord, a U.S. Army post (which was eventually closed in 1994). She had been assaulted and strangled to death, according to police. Over the years, many agencies — including the U.S. Army’s Criminal Investigations Division — tried to solve the case, but it eventually went cold, according to the Herald. But Seaside police are now working with the Monterey County District Attorney’s Office Cold Case Task Force to find answers — four decades later. “This is one of the most disturbing cold cases we’ve had,” acting Seaside Police Chief Nicholas Borges told the Herald. “Going through all our files, it’s clear there is a monster involved.” “New leads have surfaced in recent time, and the case has officially been reopened,” police said in Wednesday’s release. According to the Herald, the cold case task force received a $500,000 grant to investigate unsolved cases, including Anne Sang’s. “While I can’t get into specifics, there is a lot of evidence, and I am hopeful we can bring justice for that beautiful little angel,” Chief Borges told the Herald. Deputy District Attorney Matthew L’Heureux, who heads the task force, also didn’t specify which new leads prompted a renewal of Anne Sang’s case but stated, “DNA is something we look for in any case,” when asked by the Herald. Anne Sang, the daughter of Vietnamese refugees, was born in the United States after her parents fled their home country when the North Vietnamese invaded South Vietnam in 1975, according to a Monterey Herald archive. Her father, Tuong Van Pham, became a herring fisherman. Both of Anne Sang’s parents have since passed away, though authorities have notified her surviving siblings about the recent updates, according to the Herald. According to police, Anne Sang was one of 10 children, and was described as a “shy” and “sensitive” little girl. “Anne, we have not forgotten you,” Seaside Police wrote on their Facebook page. “And we are working hard to bring you justice.” “We have quite a bit of evidence that existed from the onset of the case,” said Borges. “I want to solve every cold case we have. There is nothing more rewarding than giving the family a sense of justice by being able to tell them, ‘Here is the person who killed your loved one.’” Anyone with information about Anne Sang Thi Pham’s murder is asked to contact acting Chief Borges at 831-899-6892 or the Monterey County District Attorney’s Office at 831-755-5267.",U.S./Oxygen,Authorities Reopen ‘Most Disturbing Cold Case’ Of 5-Year-Old Found Dead At US Army Base,https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-reopen-most-disturbing-cold-231949038.html
