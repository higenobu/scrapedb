1/24/2022,"Louise Rands Silva, who has died of cancer aged 57, worked as my assistant for nearly 30 years, on cases, books and a myriad of other activities relating to matters of international law and justice. She also had a strong commitment to community engagement, working in parallel in education, for Sure Start, as a forest school leader, at a school working with children with behavioural difficulties, and as a teaching assistant at a primary school. Born in Byfleet, Surrey, Louise was the daughter of Barbara Wright, a primary school teacher, and John Rands, a public health inspector. When the family moved to north Devon she went to school at South Molton community college and Kelly college, then spent a year working on a kibbutz in Israel. In 1986 she went to St Edmund Hall, Oxford University, to study English literature. She moved to Brazil, to teach English as a foreign language, returning to London to work as a paralegal at a Brazilian law firm.  In 1992 I employed Louise at the Foundation for International Environmental Law and Development at Soas University of London. There we worked together on projects about climate change, sustainable development, and international courts and tribunals. A highlight for her was being part of the team in The Hague on the 1996 case on the legality of the use of nuclear weapons which ruled that environmental protection was now part of international law. While there, Louise took a part-time master’s degree at Soas, in South American development studies. In 1993 she married Maú de Jesus Silva, a guide and musician whom she had met in Brazil, and later they moved to Bideford, north Devon, to raise their children. There, Louise began her work in education, focusing on young families and in her work as a forest school leader, taking children into the outdoors to help them understand the wonders of the natural world. In later years she worked with refugee families in north Devon, teaching English. Over this entire period, Louise and I never stopped working together. She transcribed every interview I conducted, for books and cases, and typed and corrected the manuscripts of 15 books, from a treatise on international environmental law to the more recent East West Street (2016) and The Ratline (2020). She shared thoughts about characters and themes, enriching every book. She was a first sounding board, a trusted colleague and friend who offered significant input on the issues she cared about. A few weeks before her death she was still working, on my forthcoming book about Chagos, The Last Colony, and was immortalised by Martin Rowson in one of his illustrations for the book. Louise was a truly decent person, smart and warm, humorous and generous, understated and utterly reliable. Maú died in 2007. She is survived by their sons, Gabriel and Rafael, by her siblings, Caroline and Edward, and by her mother, Barbara.",News/Law,Louise Rands Silva obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/23/louise-rands-silva-obituary
1/24/2022,"Malcolm Troup, who has died aged 91, was a distinguished pianist, musicologist and educator. He was also my predecessor as chairman of the Beethoven Piano Society of Europe. Born in Toronto, Malcolm was the son of William Troup, a cattle farmer turned stockbroker, and Wendela (nee Seymour Conway), a graduate of the Royal Academy of Music. She was Malcolm’s first piano teacher, and he displayed remarkable early talent.  He won a scholarship to the Toronto Conservatory, where he and Glenn Gould, a close friend, both studied with Alberto Guerrero. Aged 17, he made his debut with the CBC Toronto Orchestra in Anton Rubinstein’s massive Concerto in D minor, early evidence of his fearless, restlessly exploratory temperament. Subsequently he studied in London with Sidney Harrison (1950-52) and in Saarbrücken, Germany, with Walter Gieseking (1954-56), receiving the Harriet Cohen Commonwealth medal in 1955. During this period, he toured ceaselessly in Canada, Europe (with frequent performances in the Soviet Union) and South America. A born performer, colourful and flamboyant, he often received standing ovations and gave many encores. On one of his trips to South America he met his future wife, Carmen Lamarca Subercasaux, a member of the Chilean nobility who joined him in London in 1961: they wed the following year at the Vatican in Rome, then settled in Islington, north London. With his inquiring mind it was natural for Malcolm to expand into musicology and academic administration. In 1967 he was already an honorary professor at the University of Chile, then received his DPhil from York University (1968) with the topic Messiaen and the Modern Mind, leading to his most celebrated recording, Messiaen’s epic cycle Vingt Regards sur l’Enfant-Jésus (1986). Typically, Malcolm insisted on recording these fearsome pieces from memory, feeling that the performances would lack the freedom and spontaneity he sought if he had the score in front of him. His prodigious memory was still active into his 70s, ever adding new works, including ones by composers sent to Nazi extermination camps from the concentration camp at the Czech town of Terezín. A rich list of academic and honorary appointments ensued: from 1970 he was music director at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, leaving in 1975 to set up the new music department at City University, London, with one of Britain’s first electronic music studios, and launching the first fellowship in Jewish music research. He was master of the Worshipful Company of Musicians (1999-2000), vice-president of the European Piano Teachers’ Association, a governor of the Music Therapy Charity Trust, chairman of the Ernest Bloch Society, and co-founder in 1993 with Carola Grindea of the Beethoven Piano Society of Europe, which he chaired till 2014. To all of these roles he brought his characteristic energy, vision, commitment and brilliance, expressed in trenchant speech and writing. Carmen died in 2011. He is survived by their daughter, Wendela, and five grandchildren, Saskia, Cosima, Damian, Natasha and Alexia.",Arts/Music,Malcolm Troup obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/23/malcolm-troup-obituary
1/24/2022,"Tonga is used to natural disasters, but they have never experienced anything like the last week. “We’ve experienced tropical cyclones, but this is so new and no one will ever forget this, ever,” says Marian Kupu, a journalist for BroadCom Broadcasting FM87.5 in Tonga.  “We didn’t know what to do or what to expect.” On Saturday 15 January, at 5:10pm local time, the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai undersea volcano erupted in a blast 600 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. It could be felt as far as away as New Zealand and Alaska. It prompted a tsunami. So far, three people have been reported dead in Tonga from the tsunami, while two more drowned in Peru after abnormally big waves from the blast reached as far as the coast of South America. There had been signs that something was wrong. All summer there had been a stench of sulphur in the air across Tonga, signalling that the undersea volcano, which lies about 65km north-west of the country’s capital of Nuku’alofa, was active. There had been small eruptions, and on the Friday, the day before the eruption and tsunami, the water in Nuku’alofa’s harbour was spinning in eddies and whirlpools, something no one had seen before. When the eruption occurred, it was so loud that Kupu’s ears were ringing. “You know that experience when you’re flying in an aeroplane with your ears? It was like that times ten. We couldn’t hear each other, we could just mimic to everyone just to run, just to go, let’s go and leave the house immediately,” she said. She and her family got into the car. The main road, normally two lanes of traffic – one in each direction – became four lanes of traffic, everyone heading east, away from the volcano. “We thought it was raining, because we can hear it clanging on top of the windshield… but there was no rain, it was those little rocks. And then dust started falling… black dust just pouring down.” The sky went dark by 6pm, when normally at this time of year nightfall doesn’t happen until 8pm. Traffic came to a standstill as people’s cars became coated with thick layers of ash. Boys ran along the road with water bottles, spraying water onto windshields so that cars could keep moving. Kupu made it to her brother’s home, inland and on higher ground, and was able to get back to her own home the next day. Since then, she has been working around the clock to tell the stories of damage and survival from Tonga. She travelled out west, to the worst-hit part of the main island, on Tuesday to see the damage there. The first thing that hit her was the smell. “I don’t know what it was from, I think [it was from] the sea bed from way out there being washed on [to land] with mud. There were even dead fishes found there on the land,” she said. The power of the tsunami was clearly visible. Coconut trees that had stood upright, now lay in rows bent to the right, almost parallel to the ground, in the direction the tsunami waves had pushed them down. Everything on the western side of the road – the direction from which the tsunami hit – had been lifted up, uprooted, carried across the road and smashed into trees on the eastern side. “Timber, bushes, cars, roofs, they were all trapped on the coconut trees on the road; houses, they were all on the other side of the road. “Everything is just dead. There is just mud, dust everywhere. The houses are just gone... Some houses are still standing, but everything inside the house is destroyed from the sea water. Beds, chairs, couches, everything gone. I mean, wet or destroyed, so it’s not liveable.” The eyes of the world have been on Tonga for the last week. During the eruption, the nation’s undersea communications cable was damaged in two places, virtually cutting the island off from the rest of the world, which waited anxiously from news. When her radio station’s satellite connection was restored, she was suddenly flooded with requests for interviews with TV stations in the US, Germany, China, the Netherlands. “People were screaming and saying ‘You’re the first person we’ve spoken to from Tonga! Are you OK?’ And I was like ‘Yeah we’re OK, I was back at work on Monday.’ “I didn’t know that the whole world thought that Tonga sank,” she said. But while she is both baffled and amused by the global attention the disaster has warranted – Kupu says she quizzes journalists on whether they had even heard of Tonga before the volcano hit and that her default explanation to people is that Tonga is near Samoa, “where The Rock is from” – she is concerned that attention will quickly move on and Tonga will be left alone with this crisis. Drinking water is a huge concern, says Kupu, given the ash that has blanketed the island, but so is food, given many people are reliant on plantations, which have been destroyed by the disaster. “I may stay calm, but we need help,” she said. “We’ve lost lives, we’ve lost homes… we have damaged homes, we have damaged roads. We need aid and we don’t know how long we’re going to be living with this and how are we going to [get through it], not only physical stuff but also mentally … because we have never experienced this.”",News/World news,‘Houses are just gone’: Tonga emerges from volcano and tsunami disaster,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/houses-are-just-gone-tonga-emerges-from-volcano-and-tsunami-disaster
1/24/2022,"Dominic Raab has urged unvaccinated NHS staff in England to come forward for their Covid jabs amid calls for the deadline on mandatory shots to be extended. Frontline healthcare workers in England must have two doses of Covid vaccine by 1 April, meaning they need to receive their first dose by 3 February to meet the deadline and avoid potentially losing their job.  While 90% of NHS staff have taken up the vaccine, mandatory vaccination is controversial and the looming deadline has led to warnings that more than 70,000 NHS staff in England could be lost at a time when the health service is under severe pressure. Speaking on the BBC’s Sunday Morning programme, Raab argued there was no need to postpone the deadline because the NHS was more resilient than it was in 2020, with more staff on which to draw. “We continue to call for those to come forward to be boosted or vaccinated before the deadline,” he said. “Ultimately we have to make sure that we don’t have people putting patients at risk if they are not vaccinated. The deadline is there to protect the most vulnerable in our hospitals, but we have got the resilience because we have got nearly 5,000 more doctors, nearly 11,000 more nurses than we did in 2020.” NHS staff who object to the policy demonstrated in central London on Saturday and further protests took place in Glasgow, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. Scotland and Wales have not made the vaccines compulsory for health or care workers. Northern Ireland plans a public consultation on the issue. An impact assessment by the Department of Health and Social Care found that 73,000 NHS staff in England could be lost as a result of the policy. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, told BBC Radio 4 that he would not rule out recruiting NHS staff who lost their jobs in England, but added: “We certainly won’t be going out there looking for them.” Several health organisations called on ministers to postpone the deadline, but the view is not unanimous. The Royal College of GPs said the policy should be delayed to prevent staff shortages. Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said compulsory vaccination for health professionals in England was “not the right way forward”. Pat Cullen, the chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said the policy would backfire if it was not delayed, while Danny Mortimer, the deputy chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents organisations within the health service, said its members wanted more time to encourage and persuade hesitant staff to get vaccinated. But Mortimer added: “We do have to acknowledge that as the deadline approaches, some frontline staff will have to leave their present roles if they continue to decline to be vaccinated.” Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, said the organisation did not believe a delay was the answer. “Our survey of trust leaders found that while there was a range of views towards a policy of mandatory vaccinations, a majority backed this policy as a means of protecting colleagues, patients and visitors from cross-infection by unvaccinated staff,” she said.",News/Society,Unvaccinated NHS staff in England urged to have Covid jab before deadline,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/unvaccinated-nhs-staff-in-england-urged-to-have-covid-jab-before-deadline
1/24/2022,"It was a moment that made all of Chelsea’s problems fade away. Suddenly, nobody was worrying about a draining fixture list and a worrying run of results. Stamford Bridge had come alive and even Hakim Ziyech was smiling after opening the scoring for Chelsea, who had looked short of inspiration before their mercurial winger gave them the lead with one of the goals of the season. This was Ziyech at his absolute best: cutting in from the right, the ball on his left foot and a shot bent wickedly into the far corner. Hugo Lloris could only watch helplessly as the ball flew past him and Chelsea, who have looked so tetchy and tired lately, could finally feel their season coming back to life.  Spurs, on the other hand, were left with nothing but regrets after losing in the league for the first time under Antonio Conte. They came into this game with hopes of dragging Chelsea into a top-four battle, but the gap looked as big as ever in the end. Ultimately, for all the strides that Spurs have made under Conte, they had none of Chelsea’s individual quality; nobody who could open up a tight game quite as inventively as Ziyech, whose splendid opener at the start of the second half was followed by Thiago Silva settling the contest with a fine header from Mason Mount’s free-kick. For Conte, this was a reminder of the size of the task ahead. For all that Spurs fared better than when Chelsea reached the Carabao Cup final at their expense earlier this month, they remain desperate for reinforcements before the transfer window shuts next week. They were competitive in the first half – Harry Kane was aggrieved to have a goal ruled out at 0-0 – but Conte’s squad still contains too much mediocrity. A central midfield of Harry Winks and Pierre-Emile Højbjerg was not good enough to deal with Jorginho, Mateo Kovacic and Mount. On the flanks, Ryan Sessegnon and Matt Doherty delivered forgettable performances. Kane simply had too much to do in attack and although the Spurs forward kept trying until the end, forcing Kepa Arrizabalaga to repel a powerful header, he deserves to be surrounded by better teammates. How Kane would love to play with someone as gifted as Ziyech, who did not even celebrate after scoring Chelsea’s goal when they drew with Brighton last Tuesday. That was the difference. Thomas Tuchel had so many options at his disposal – he could even afford to bring N’Golo Kanté on to see Chelsea over the line – and his side have fresh impetus after their first league win since Boxing Day. Tuchel had tweaked his approach, lining Chelsea up in an expansive 4-1-4-1 system that featured Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ziyech pushing up on the flanks, yet conviction eluded the European champions at first. There was less than a minute on the clock when Romelu Lukaku missed his first chance, firing over after fine work from the enterprising Mount, and the worry for Tuchel was how Chelsea would cope with Spurs’ counterattacks, particularly when Steven Bergwijn found room to turn and run. This was an opportunity for Bergwijn to build on his heroics against Leicester. One of his bursts led to Silva picking up a yellow card and there were openings for Spurs. Winks drove a shot straight at Arrizabalaga after peeling past Jorginho, who was the deepest of Chelsea’s midfielders, and Sessegnon was wasteful with a rare opening. The key moment for Spurs, who used a compact 4-4-2 formation, came in the 39th minute. Sessegnon crossed for Kane, who was not subtle enough when he gave Silva a little shove in the back. Silva was far too wily not to make the most of it and the Brazilian defender’s fall was enough to convince Paul Tierney, who was already blowing for a foul as Kane turned and fired past Arrizabalaga from close range. For all that Kane complained, though, Chelsea also had reason to feel aggrieved with the officials before the interval. The hosts easily could have been playing against 10 men after Doherty carelessly stamped on Malang Sarr – Darren England, the VAR, deemed the Irishman’s contact accidental – and they could also argue that they had dominated the opening 45 minutes in terms of possession and chances. Lukaku missed another decent chance as the opening period wore on, kicking at thin air when he should have converted Mount’s cutback. Nothing was quite working for Chelsea and the frustration was building for Lukaku, who would later find his route to goal blocked by Eric Dier on two occasions. Chelsea needed more intensity. Two minutes into the second half, they upped the pace. The move started with Hudson-Odoi surging past challenges on the left and spraying the ball to the right. The pass found Ziyech and when Sessegnon backed off, the Moroccan made the youngster pay by curling in a gorgeous shot from 25 yards. It was joyous for Chelsea and hugely irritating for Conte. Sessegnon would soon be taken off. Yet Ziyech was enjoying himself now, testing Lloris with a vicious drive, and it was not long before Chelsea scored again. The second goal was a more straightforward affair: an inswinging free-kick from Mount, soft marking from Spurs and a lovely glancing header from Silva. Normal service had been restored. Chelsea had reminded Spurs of their supremacy with cutting efficiency and Tuchel, who celebrates one year in the job on Wednesday, will hope that this is the start of a surge.",Sport/Football,Hakim Ziyech stunner sees Chelsea end Conte’s unbeaten league start at Spurs,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/23/chelsea-tottenham-premier-league-match-report
1/24/2022,"The chairman of the congressional committee investigating the US Capitol attack and Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election revealed on Sunday that the panel has spoken to the former attorney general William Barr, a further indication that the inquiry has moved closer to the ex-president’s inner circle.  Bennie Thompson told CBS’s Face the Nation that Barr, who was accused of making the justice department Trump’s tool but who resigned before Trump left office, had spoken more than once with the panel. “To be honest with you, we’ve had conversations with the former attorney general already,” Thompson said. His host, Margaret Brennan, asked if the panel would seek answers from Barr over the discovery of a draft executive order for the US military to seize voting machines in contested states. “We have talked to Department of Defense individuals,” Thompson said. “We are concerned that our military was part of this big lie on promoting that the election was false. If you are using the military to potentially seize voting machines, even though it’s a discussion, the public needs to know.” News of the interviews with Barr, who angered Trump by insisting there was no evidence to support his lies of a stolen election, dealt another blow to the former president, whose political and legal woes escalated significantly this week. Unlike other Trumpworld insiders who have refused to cooperate with the January 6 committee, such as the former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, strategist Steve Bannon and national security adviser Michael Flynn, Barr appears to have spoken willingly. It reflects moves by the House panel to focus more closely on Trump’s actions following the election, including his inciting of the deadly January 6 attack on the US Capitol. This week, the committee asked for the cooperation of Trump’s daughter Ivanka. “Our strategy is to get to all the facts and circumstances that brought about January 6,” Thompson said. “And obviously Ivanka Trump was a major adviser to the president all along, a number of items [are] attributed to what she’s been saying and so we asked her to come in voluntarily and give us the benefit of what she knows.” The inquiry has also subpoenaed phone records of Trump’s son Eric and Kimberly Guilfoyle, partner of Donald Jr. Trump is not pleased, complaining in an interview with the rightwing Washington Examiner that the committee was made up of “vicious people” who “go after children”. Donald Trump Jr is 44, Ivanka Trump is 40 and Eric Trump is 38.",News/US news,"Capitol attack committee has spoken to Trump AG William Barr, chairman says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/23/capitol-attack-committee-donald-trump-william-barr
1/24/2022,"Ukraine is reacting “seriously” to UK Foreign Office allegations that Moscow has plans to invade the country and install a puppet government, a senior government adviser has said, adding that Kyiv is resisting Russian efforts to destabilise its government and economy. The extraordinary Foreign Office claims that Moscow may topple the government and install Yevhen Murayev, a former MP who controls a pro-Russia television station, were met with shock and some scepticism in Ukrainian political and media circles on Sunday.  The Foreign Office made the allegations as the UK pledged to take a more aggressive posture over Russia’s buildup of more than 100,000 troops and weaponry on the border with Ukraine. Murayev himself denied that he was involved in any plot, telling the Observer he had been banned from entering Russia and was in a conflict with a close ally of Vladimir Putin. “It isn’t very logical,” he said. On Sunday he said he was prepared to defend his “honest name” against the British allegations and he posted a picture on Facebook of himself altered to look like James Bond. But an adviser to the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff said the alleged plot matched Russian efforts to promote discord in Ukraine. Mykhailo Podolyak told Reuters that although there was doubt among Ukrainians as to whether Murayev was “too ridiculous a figure” to be the Kremlin’s pick to lead Ukraine, Russia had propped up previously minor figures in leadership positions in annexed Crimea and separatist-held Donbass, and that therefore “one should take this information as seriously as possible”. In separate comments to Agence-France Presse, Podolyak said: “Our state will continue its policy of dismantling any oligarchic or political structures that could be working to destabilise Ukraine” or aid Russia. The Kremlin had for some time followed a formula of selecting individuals in business or politics and then using those people to “promote Russia’s interests”, Podolyak said, and “this British information clearly follows along in this logical chain”. The Foreign Office has not provided any evidence to support the allegations, which came as Boris Johnson’s domestic political troubles deepened. British sources emphasised on Sunday afternoon that the coup plot warning on Saturday followed a UK intelligence assessment, a different formulation from earlier briefings that had suggested it was based on “US-led intelligence”. The accusations have increased tensions as discussions rage about how best to deter Vladimir Putin from launching a new invasion of Ukraine. Russian tanks and artillery, military vehicles and fighter aircraft continued to arrive within striking distance of Ukraine’s borders this weekend, and Russian troops have been sighted less than 20 miles from the border. Moscow has announced sweeping naval exercises that will put its ships in close proximity with Nato forces while potentially positioning landing craft for an amphibious assault on Ukraine’s southern coast. Before a foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday, a senior European official said the EU would be ready to launch sanctions “within days” if Russian troops launch an invasion. The meeting is partially meant to address divisions in the EU over how to deter Russia, with Germany hesitant to provide lethal arms to Ukraine or target the Russian banking sector. Other states have called for pre-emptive sanctions against Russia in order to show the Kremlin that western countries are resolved to strike back in case of an invasion of Ukraine. But the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, rejected that idea during a television appearance on Sunday, saying it would not work to deter a potential Russian attack. “When it comes to sanctions, the purpose of those sanctions is to deter Russian aggression. And so if they are triggered now, you lose the deterrent effect,” Blinken told CNN’s State of the Union in an interview. Blinken also said he had “no doubts” Germany was maintaining a united front with Nato on the crisis, after its navy chief, Kay-Achim Schönbach, said Putin deserved respect and suggested it was “nonsense” to think Russia was ready to pour troops into Ukraine. Schönbach resigned on Saturday, but his remarks rattled Nato. The Kremlin has denied it is sabre-rattling as it announces snap drills and continues to deploy troops toward Ukraine, waving off the UK’s accusations of a plot to topple the government as “disinformation”. “The disinformation disseminated by the UK foreign ministry is more evidence that it is namely Nato countries led by the Anglo-Saxons who are engaged in the escalation of tensions around Ukraine,” the Russian foreign ministry said on Sunday. Nonetheless, the growing scope of the Russian military exercises amid an urgent European security crisis has worried western observers. The Irish government has decried plans for Russian warships and bombers to conduct missile tests 150 miles off the south-west coast of County Cork next month. And Russia’s northern fleet is preparing to hold military drills this week in an area that overlaps with Norway’s exclusive economic zone, the Barents Observer news website reported. A spokesperson for the Norwegian joint headquarters told the outlet that Norway would monitor the drills but that Russia had the right to hold exercises in international waters.",News/World news,"Ukraine taking UK claim of Russian invasion plot seriously, says adviser",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/ukraine-taking-uk-claim-of-russian-invasion-plot-seriously-says-adviser
