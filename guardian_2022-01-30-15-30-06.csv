1/30/2022,"The windowbox rosemary is covered in late-January flower. The Bengal crimson rose is still showing bud. Unfurling flower. Even the lavender has bloom. It has been 15C this month. Welcome to the warming. The Bengal rose was a gift from Howard from Great Dixter. A skinny stem just three years ago, now a rampant, vibrant bush, flowering through, full of leaf. I hope it soon gets a rest.  There are four vigorous hellebores in pots. Different styles in different sizes. They are making me happy. Particularly the deep purple. We are isolating, waiting on negative PCR tests before being released. I gaze longingly out past the window box, past the delicate rosemary flower, over the back gardens. I wave at Kala holding a neighbour’s big ginger cat. I am impatient to tidy. To clear the nasturtium corpses extravagantly draped over her grass and her neighbours’ walls. To dig the last fallen sunflower stems. I notice one of her roses, too, still has crimson bloom. The roof terrace is our outside space. The size of a smallish bedroom; I walk around it like in a scene from Porridge. A miniaturised exercise yard with an exercise bike facing out. I stop to stare at the flowers. To wonder about the semi-dormant spring bulbs. Too anxiously scanning for new life breaking through. It is in these times when realise how much access to the plot has come to mean to me. I wonder how the contractors are doing. When they will finish the work. When we can get a feel for the new soil, the new space. Until then, I obsess over the rooftop magnolia stellata, wondering which furry buds will become flowers, which will be leaf. Soon enough we’ll be back walking over Hampstead Heath. Looking out over London. Scanning for comforting signs of early spring. After all, I tell myself, February is only a few days away. Allan Jenkins’s Plot 29 (4th Estate, £9.99) is out now.

1/30/2022,"And then there were five. More to the point, there are only five. To win a major on all three surfaces is a rarity. So rare, in fact, that the only current players to have achieved it before Saturday night’s Australian Open women’s singles final were Serena Williams, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Now Ash Barty joins them, and that is where the list ends. Four all-time greats of the game holding 83 grand slam crowns between them, and one who has three on which to build.  Aside from Barty, Williams is the only other in this elite category to have the first three slams across clay, grass and hard courts. Perhaps it is a hint of things to come. “I feel very humble to be in such a select group,” Barty said. “To be honest, I don’t really feel like I belong with those champions of our sport. I’m still very much learning and trying to refine my craft and try and learn every single day and get better and better. “It’s amazing to be able to have this experience and this opportunity on three different surfaces and be really consistent across the board. Ultimately that was one of the biggest challenges that Jim [Joyce, her childhood coach] set out for me when I was young was to be a complete player and be really consistent across all surfaces and be able to play on all surfaces.” It stands to reason that this confirms her versatility. Not only in her precise serve, backhand slices and driving groundstrokes, and her flexibility to change a point’s pace at will, but also her capacity to adapt to different conditions. Danielle Collins acknowledged as much during the trophy presentation following her final loss. “I really admire you as a player and the variety of your game,” she said. “Hopefully I can implement some of that into mine.” The fruits of this variety are evident in a plentiful assembly of statistics. Barty’s 2022 win-loss record now stands at 11-0. The 25-year-old is the fourth female player in the Open era with a 100% winning rate in major finals (of a minimum three titles) after Virginia Wade, Jennifer Capriati and Naomi Osaka. This triumph is the fifth time a slam has been won with 30 or fewer games conceded (Williams lays claim to three of these and Iga Świątek the other). On the all-time fewest-games-dropped charts, she is now tied in eighth spot with Martina Navratilova, Stefi Graf and Mary Pierce. Over Barty’s seven matches her serve was broken three times – the fewest breaks conceded by a women’s singles slam winner since 2016, bettering Garbiñe Muguruza (five, 2017 Wimbledon), Naomi Osaka (five, 2018 US Open), Serena Williams (six, 2016 Wimbledon) and Emma Raducanu (seven, 2021 US Open). She is, virtually unbreakable. And yet there also remains room for improvement. In none of her major titles has she faced an opponent ranked in the top 20. She is the third player in the Open era to have avoided this particular challenge. As she has said many times, and did so again on Saturday, she is still “learning” and “refining”. The major she has yet to win is the US Open. The assumption is that it is hers for the taking. However her long-time coach, Craig Tyzzer, is adamant it is not unless officials change the balls. Wilson balls are used for both men’s and women’s events at Flushing Meadows but, unlike in the other majors, the men’s version is heavier-duty with a fuzzier yellow-felt coating. At last year’s US Open, from which Barty exited in the third round, two bolters reached the final in British qualifier Radacanu and unseeded Canadian Leylah Fernandez. “The US Open really needs to change the ball for the girls,” Tyzzer said. “The fact they still use a different ball for guys and girls, it’s a terrible ball for someone like Ash … the ball itself is so light. “It was the only tournament last year and really for two years where she uses gut racket [most powerful strings] but I had to change her to a poly [polyester] just to get any sort of control of the ball. If they keep that ball the same, no one like Ash will win that tournament. “I think you see the result at the US Open, it was two players who you go, ‘wow, that was two different players won that’. There’s no surprise when the ball is like it is.” The titles Barty already has under her belt came, she said, at “all very different stages of my life”. “To be able to have this feeling and experience this a few times over, I just understand how fortunate I am to be able to experience that, because not many people get to do that. It’s just been an incredible journey over this past 20 years of hitting a tennis ball, but particularly the last five or six years in this second phase of my career.”",Sport/Sport,All-conquering Ash Barty remains humble despite joining greats in exclusive club | Emma Kemp,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/30/all-conquering-ash-barty-remains-humble-despite-joining-greats-in-exclusive-club
1/30/2022,"Reading Will Hutton’s piece on the threat posed by the police and crime bill to our democratic right to peaceful protest got me thinking about how we should challenge it if it is eventually passed (“Attempting to ban protest is usually the mark of a repressive state. That’s not us, is it?”, Comment). I am dismayed at the lack of coverage being given to the dangers of climate change; it is as if Cop26 never happened. Government, big business, the media and the public are rejoicing at the prospect of resuming foreign holidays, cruises, driving to work again and consuming. What happened to “building back greener”? I would like to see a grand coalition of environmental groups joining forces and getting out on to the streets. A few thousand Extinction Rebellion protesters blocking roads may be dismissed as “crusties”. Hundreds of thousands of “middle England” members of the RSPB, National Trust, Wildlife Trust, Woodland Trust et al could not be so easily ignored. Even this government can’t arrest and imprison us all.Geoff JonesLincoln  The treatment of Kate Clanchy by her publisher, in dropping her from its list and dropping a book of poems by her pupils, makes one wonder what has happened to the tradition that publishers stick by their authors (“The hounding of author Kate Clanchy has been a witch-hunt without mercy”, Comment). It also makes one feel helpless: how to show solidarity with this exceptionally humane woman in the face of treatment such as this? One solution might be for Pan Macmillan’s authors to sever their links with this disgraceful publishing house. One thing publishers can’t do without is authors. I have published several books with Macmillan, but that was years ago and they’re now out of print. If I was still publishing with them, I’d break my contract and publicise the reason why as widely as possible. Behaviour like this brings the entire industry into disrepute.Ruth BrandonLondon NW3 Eric Williams’s Capitalism and Slavery was certainly recognised as an important book in the 1960s (“Hidden history of why the British abolished slavery back on the shelves”, News). I still have a copy of the 1964 André Deutsch edition. It was recommended to me as a sixth former in the late 60s and my history teacher, Patrick Richardson, who was an expert on 18th-century history, also used it in his published work which included work for school students. He also taught us to balance sources and historians, so Williams was one voice among many. It was also among the works on my reading lists at university. It is often asserted (by Sathnam Sanghera, among others) that slavery was not taught in schools until recently. This is certainly not true. I taught it as part of the curriculum in comprehensive schools in the 1970s and the well-known Jackdaw series for schools had a whole pack on the African slave trade, with graphic images. Later, when I was visiting a range of schools for a publisher in the 1980s, slavery/the slave trade was in the curriculum, placing it of course in its full historical context. To assert that modern academic historians don’t recognise the context of abolition is not sustainable.Peter LangworthLondon NW1 Poor people become poorer because wage negotiations and benefit rises are based on inappropriate inflation indices (“Poor people face a perfect storm. Let no one tell you it’s their fault”, Comment). The CPI and RPI underestimate inflation for poorer people by including items such as new cars and consumer durables that generally have a lower inflation rate than food, energy and rent. We need an additional index based on, say, the spending of the poorest 20% of households.Richard MountfordHildenborough, Kent Kenan Malik is wrong in claiming that the Labour government “ignored” the recommendations of the 1999 select committee report following the Garnock Court fire (“Grenfell delivers yet more horrors. But the guilty still fail to take responsibility”, Comment). As minister responsible for the building regulations from 1997-2001, I gave evidence to the select committee and responded to all its recommendations. In the government response, I agreed to introduce the new full-scale test methodology as recommended by the committee and confirmed that I had begun the process to secure its adoption as a British Standard. I made it clear that when this was achieved the government would amend the guidance (Approved Document B) to reflect its status as a British Standard and review whether the reference in the guidance should be strengthened. On the committee’s tragically prescient concern about the possibility of a serious fire resulting in many people being killed, I strongly endorsed the committee’s view, explained the mandatory requirements of the building regulations – in this case “to resist the spread of fire over the external wall surfaces” – and the role of the guidance document and added: “The department considers that if this guidance is followed, then the risk to life safety as a result of fire spread via the external cladding system will be minimal.” Sadly, the shocking evidence that has been emerging from the Grenfell public inquiry has illustrated serious subsequent failures to adhere to the requirements of the regulations and the advice in the guidance in Approved Document B. In the amended online version of the article, Kenan Malik maintained that the retention of approval for Class 0 materials was a “loophole”, which undermined the government’s response. However, the government’s technical advisers (the Building Regulations Advisory Committee), which had recently conducted a review of Part B of the building regulations, made no recommendation to withdraw approval from Class 0. The select committee emphasised that the main focus of concern was the adequacy of the previous small-scale arrangements for testing the performance of materials, which is why the government supported the introduction of the large-scale test. Like all other materials, Class 0 should have been subject to the new, more rigorous testing regime designed to demonstrate the performance of cladding materials in a “live” fire situation after the test methodology was adopted as a British Standard. A reading of the government response to the select committee report illustrates the degree to which the government at that time was seriously committed to enhance fire safety and, far from ignoring the committee’s report, engaged fully and constructively with the committee, and many others, to this purpose.Nick RaynsfordLondon SE10 Farmers don’t need to plant trees as they have already been planted – in their hedges (“Farmers’ dilemma: if we plant trees, will we take a cash hit?”, News). The trees already in our hedges have a good rootstock, are healthy, indigenous and can start absorbing carbon immediately – if hedges are just “faced” but not “topped” with the tractor flail every year. If farmers were paid for the trees already growing on their land, rather than wished for, we could make a major and immediate impact on carbon absorption, rather than waiting 20 years for newly planted trees.Bob HarveyBlackawton, Totnes, Devon William Keegan’s comparison of Boris Johnson to Falstaff is extremely apt.

1/30/2022,"Juke and Loe, 617 Ecclesall Rd, Sheffield S11 8PT (0114 268 0271, jukeandloe.com). Lunch – two courses £25, three courses £30. Dinner – starters £14-£16, mains £24-£30, desserts £10. Wines from £24 It is time to address the most pressing question of the age: when going out to eat during the week, which is better, lunch or dinner? The arguments for dinner are cheerfully robust. The working day is at an end, so we are not dodging important jobs like pretending to study a vital spreadsheet while actually watching hilarious reels on Instagram of dogs being shocked by their own farts. Mostly we are not dodging our own puritan guilt. We are free to show the wine list some truly grown-up, adult love.  There are downsides, however. Restaurants make their real money in the evenings, hence that’s when the bigger prices are charged. We do not begrudge them that. In return for the extra dosh, you get the more developed, filigreed expression of the kitchen’s art. There will be more stuff on the plate. This is either a positive or a negative, depending on taste. If the restaurant is especially popular, tables will be harder to come by and you’ll have to bash the online booking form furiously in the hope of finding a civilised slot. Finally, there is the issue of a restful night’s sleep. It’s simply harder to kip on a stomach full of over-ordered sharing plates and a barrel full of the second cheapest lousy merlot on the list. The struggle is real. What of lunch? You have more time to digest, of course. Sleep comes easier. Plus, the real bargains are found at lunchtime: it’s when the grand places offer their cheap but extremely cheerful menus. One of the bleaker moments of the pandemic, for those too interested in their bellies, was the decision by Le Gavroche to close at lunchtime because of staff shortages. The three-course lunch menu there, including half a bottle of very good wine, petits fours and service, was legendary. At the point it was discontinued it was £76, which is a slab of anyone’s cash. Then again, the full high-kicking lineup in the evening can easily be double that or more, so much more. Of course, that bargain can quickly be cancelled out by having to take the day off work to facilitate the decadence of a cheaper weekday lunch. Although there is the sweet, groinal twinge of the illicit that comes with shouting, “Sod it, I’ll have another bottle of that delightful Chablis. What do you mean, it’s 2pm on a Wednesday?” God, but it’s complicated. At which point I must acknowledge, as ever, the stupid privilege of my job which not only allows me to visit Sheffield to discover the joys of Juke & Loe at lunchtime, but actually requires me to do so. There, two courses are £25 and three, £30 as against around £50 in the evening. It’s a small bistro, a couple of miles from the city centre, run by two brothers, Luke and Joseph Grayson. I assume the name is a sweet spoonerism of their first names. That lunch menu, currently served only on Fridays and Saturdays, has three choices at each course: one meat, one fish, one vegetarian. Initially I thought I had travelled some distance to be fed something merely solid but unshowy. To start there was a perfectly competent plate of salt and chilli squid with mayonnaise enriched by the briny hit of oysters. There was a crispy duck salad with cucumber and orange, which recalled the version created by Gary Lee at the Ivy when it was still good. Then the mains came along and it stepped far beyond solid to become something delightful and impressive. It’s the sort of cookery that makes you pause, mid-conversation, and study the plate. A milky white fillet of precisely cooked plaice has been rolled in on itself. It sits on a thick, glossy beurre blanc, perky with lemon and studded with capers. Butter and reduced white wine have been beaten together until they have surrendered and become firm friends. There is a good sprinkling of chives. On the side there’s a bowl of buttery new potatoes. Bliss. The other main is a braised beef cheek that has miraculously kept its shape despite having been cooked until, like a highly strung cabaret artiste, it is waiting to fall apart completely. It comes with one of those lip-smacking meaty sauces that was meant to go out of fashion sometime around 1984, but never got the memo. It’s a joy to pour on to the plate. With it is a hefty canoe of powerfully dressed cos lettuce leaves. It’s described as an ox tongue Caesar salad. It doesn’t dishonour the name. With it are well-made chips under a truffled mayo. There’s nothing coy or understated about any of this. It’s bold cooking designed to satisfy rather than impress with its own cleverness. It all reminds me of the crowd-pleasing but luxurious food at Gary Usher’s Elite Bistros further to the west: places like Kala in Manchester and Burnt Truffle in Heswall. The essentials of each dish have been understood and then built upon. But they know exactly when to stop. Desserts are equally delightful. A dome of honey parfait comes dribbled with more honey, and ringed by pieces of honeycomb and cubes of soft honey cake; a shiny oblong of a chocolate delice is stabbed by slices of caramelised white chocolate and is accompanied by a scoop of white chocolate ice-cream. Despite having written a ribald hymn in praise of lunchtime drinking, neither of us do so today. He has a car to drive; I have a train to catch and I do so hate dribbling down the windows. That said, the short list – a bit of the old world, a bit of the new – is priced to make it seem like a really good idea. There’s nothing beyond a Paxton Shiraz from Australia at £39. So what of the evening menu? Well yes, it’s slightly longer and more expensive, though there is also more ambition. In the current version the squid starter comes with a hot and sour squid consommé, the braised beef cheek main is joined on the plate by an ox tongue boudin. I’m sure the simple room with its stripped floorboards and picture window on to the street, will do the business at night. I’m sure it’s lovely. But I can tell you that on a Friday lunchtime, if you can slack off from work and tell yourself all the good self-justifying stories and seriously investigate your inner louche, it’s also a very nice place to be. Today, I win at lunch. Cardiff-based Matsudai Ramen, which delivers ramen kits nationwide, has joined forces with noodle meister Tim Anderson, to create a kit with proceeds going to charity. Together they have developed a kit version of Anderson’s Lazy Goat Ragu-Men, named London’s best dish by Time Out in 2018 when it was served at Anderson’s then restaurant Nanban. It includes curried goat, handmade noodles and scotch bonnet-infused bamboo shoots. The kits will be available from 18 February for two weeks and will cost £13.99 each, with money raised going to Cardiff Mind and Mosaic Brixton (matsudai.co.uk). Meanwhile in London, Claude Bosi, chef-patron of the multi-Michelin starred Bibendum, is also expanding. He has announced plans to open Socca Bistro on South Audley Street in Mayfair. It will take its inspiration from the culinary traditions of the French Riviera and is a collaboration with restaurateur Samyukta Nair, who is behind Bombay Bustle and MiMi Mei Fair. Socca should open in the summer. Well known publican and restaurateur Piers Baker of the Sun Inn in Dedham, has acquired the White Hart Inn on Mersea Island, Essex, a renowned area of pilgrimage for oyster lovers everywhere. The pub, which has been closed since 2013, is undergoing a refurbishment and will, according to Baker, cater “for everything from a casual pint to a special dinner”.

1/30/2022,"According to this week’s release from the commerce department, the US economy has been growing at its fastest pace in almost 40 years. Corporate profits are their highest in 70 years. And the stock market, although gyrating wildly of late, is still scoring record gains.  So why do most Americans remain gloomy about the economy? Mainly because their real (inflation-adjusted) wages continue to go nowhere. Steeply-rising profits, economic growth and stock market highs – coupled with near-stagnant wages – has been the story of the American economy for decades. Most economic gains have gone to the top. So why not share the profits? Profit-sharing was tried with great success in the early decades of the 20th century but is now all but forgotten. In 1916, Sears, Roebuck & Co, then one of America’s largest corporations with more than 30,000 employees, announced it would begin to share profits with its employees, giving workers shares of stock and thereby making them part-owners. The idea caught on. Other companies that joined the profit-sharing bandwagon included Procter & Gamble, Pillsbury, Kodak and US Steel. The Bureau of Labor Statistics suggested profit-sharing as a means of reducing “frequent and often violent disputes” between employers and workers. Profit-sharing gave workers an incentive to be more productive, since the success of the company meant higher profits would be shared. It also reduced the need for layoffs during recessions because payroll costs dropped as profits did. By the 1950s, Sears workers had accumulated enough stock that they owned a quarter of the company. And by 1968, the typical Sears salesperson could retire with a nest egg worth well over $1m, in today’s dollars. The downside was that when profits went down, workers’ paychecks would shrink. And if a company went bankrupt, workers would lose all their investments in it. The best profit-sharing plans took the form of cash bonuses that employees could invest however they wish, on top of predictable wages. But profit-sharing with regular employees all but disappeared in large US corporations. Ever since the early 1980s when corporate “raiders” (now private-equity managers) began demanding high returns, corporations stopped granting employees shares of stock, presumably because they didn’t want to dilute share prices. Sears phased out its profit-sharing plan in the 1970s. Yet, just as profit-sharing with regular employees disappeared, profit-sharing with top executives took off, as big Wall Street banks, hedge funds, private equity funds and high-tech companies began doling out huge wads of stock and stock options to their MVPs. The result? Share prices and chief executive pay (composed increasingly of shares of stock and options to buy stock) have gone into the stratosphere, while the wages of the typical worker have barely risen. Researchers have found that before the 1980s, almost all the increases in share prices on the US stock market could be accounted for by overall economic growth. But since then, a large portion of the increases have come out of what used to go into wages. Jeff Bezos, who now owns around 10% of Amazon’s shares, is worth $170.4bn. Other top Amazon executives hold hundreds of millions of dollars of shares. But most of Amazon’s employees, such as warehouse workers, haven’t shared in the bounty. Amazon used to give out stock to hundreds of thousands of its employees. But in 2018 it stopped the practice and instead raised its minimum hourly wage to $15. The wage raise got headlines and was good PR – Amazon is still touting it – but the decision to end stock awards was more significant. It hurt employees far more than the increased minimum helped them. If Amazon’s 1.2 million employees together owned the same proportion of Amazon’s stock as Sears workers did in the 1950s – a quarter of the company – each Amazon worker would now own shares worth an average of more than $350,000. America’s trend toward higher profits, higher share prices, mounting executive pay but near stagnant wages is unsustainable, economically and politically. Profit-sharing is one answer. But how can it be encouraged? Reduce corporate taxes on companies that share profits with all their workers, and increase taxes on those that do not. Sharing profits with all workers is a logical and necessary step to making the system work for the many, not the few.

1/30/2022,"Blind Spot Dolcetto, Adelaide Hills, Australia 2020 (£11.50, The Wine Society) I’ve been a big fan of the Blind Spot range of Australian wines since it emerged a decade ago. The project is a collaboration between one of Australia’s best winemakers, Mac Forbes, and one of the UK’s best wine retailers, the Wine Society. Forbes made his name with a range of exceptionally elegant wines from various small plots in the Yarra Valley. For the Blind Spot range, the Wine Society turned to Forbes to act on its behalf as what the Burgundians call a négociant: sourcing interesting wine from producers all over Australia which the Society would then bottle under the Blind Spot label and sell at reasonable prices. The latest vintage of the Dolcetto is a delicious tribute to their methods: a plum-tangy take on the Piemonte grape grown in the Adelaide Hills. Aldi The Voyage Australian Durif, Victoria, Australia 2020 (£8.99, Aldi) The rest of the quartet of new Blind Spot releases takes things a step further with Forbes sourcing grapes and making the wines himself. Together, they make for a revealing snapshot of current trends. There’s a wonderfully fragrant Syrah (£12.95) from the fashionable Grampians region of western Victoria in the modern Australian idiom; a red so light it’s almost a rosé in its crisp acidity and sappy strawberry, made from Pinot Meunier (£12.95); and a genteel white take on northern Italy’s soave, made from Garganega (£11.50). The latter pair are examples of Australia’s growing confidence with lesser-known varieties, a development you can also trace in a recent addition at Aldi, in the shape of the inky and succulent red made from the unheralded durif.  Tolpuddle Vineyard, Tasmania Chardonnay, Australia 2019 (£48, Woodshire Wines, theatreofwine.com; philglas-swiggot.com) For all the cornucopia of varieties and styles now on offer in Australia, the grape variety I keep coming back to is chardonnay. The very particular, Southern Ocean-cooled climate of Tasmania is the source of many of the best examples, whether it’s being used to make the southern hemisphere’s best champagne-style wines or multilayered dry whites. Of the former, the steel-and-silk feel of the House of Arras Blanc de Blancs NV (£25, harveynichols.com) makes it a treat. For still wines, a recent highlight is the electric Tolpuddle from a vineyard originally planted in 1988 by two of the far-sighted stars of Australia’s emergence as a fine-wine country, Tony Jordan and Garry Crittenden, and now owned and run by two other distinguished winemakers from the same generation: Martin Shaw and Michael Hill-Smith.

1/30/2022,"It was meant to be a sermon on the importance of having faith in God’s vision, even when that task seems difficult. An object lesson from the book of Mark, in which Jesus heals a blind man by spitting on his eyes. But it’s how Pastor Michael Todd brought this message home that made the sermon unforgettable. Addressing congregants and a live-streaming audience, Todd placed one hand on the shoulder of a closed-eyed worshipper on stage before letting out a deep snort and twice hacking phlegm into his other hand. The audible gasps inside the Transformation Church, a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based mega ministry rooted firmly in Black Baptist tradition, turned to full on outcry when Todd smeared said loogie on the worshipper’s face.  “How you just reacted is how people in your life will react when God is doing what it takes for the miracle,” the pastor reassured horrified onlookers. That the man playing blind on stage turned out to be Todd’s brother Bentom didn’t make the pastor’s, erm, heavy-handed demonstration any less revolting. The internet broke into fits at first sight of this clip. “God wasn’t nowhere near that,” snarked the Root’s Shanelle Genai. “If your pastor rubs spit on your face”, quipped the Rev Dr Chuck Currie, a United Church of Christ minister, “find a new pastor.” Still, a fair few came to Todd’s defense, some making a case for saliva’s medicinal properties and others making a broader case for nastier offenses other shepherds have committed against their flocks. (See Commandments 8 and 9.) Within days, Todd predictably reappeared on camera to apologize for his “too extreme and too disgusting” example. “It’s never my intention to distract others from God’s Word and the message of Jesus … even with illustrations!” In this Covid-addled chapter of the internet age, the 35-year-old Todd epitomizes a new brand of holy man – the preacher-influencer. In South Carolina, there’s the Oprah-approved John Gray. In Georgia there’s Jamal Bryant, a preacher’s kid turned megachurch leader who sometimes appears alongside his ex-wife on The Real Housewives of Potomac. But none is as of-the-moment as Todd – whose second book, Crazy Faith: It’s Only Crazy Until It Happens, could just as easily describe his viral clip. He promotes family on TikTok and parades fashion on Instagram. When memes like the Silhouette Challenge go viral, Todd isn’t just aware; he has a whole tangent in a sermon about “men anchoring their families” in which he discourages young ladies from “being impressive” with their bodies – an aside met with considerable pushback from secular feminists who’d long written off the Black church as overly paternalistic. It’s definitely not the kind of thing you can imagine hearing from Jesse Jackson. For more than a decade, these preacher-influencers have been spreading the gospel to reach souls spending more of their lives in front of screens. And it was only a matter of time before Todd reached them. “The principle of what he’s doing is very, very difficult,” says Cean James, the 47-year-old leader of Philadelphia Salt & Light ministries. It used to be that the Baptist preacher didn’t need much in the way of frills; he (usually a he) was the show – needing only a bit of gospel organ, a catchy refrain and a dash of the holy spirit to move the crowd. With his father as a pulpit mentor, Martin Luther King Jr elevated this elocution style into an historic second act as a civil rights icon and touring public speaker. It’s a style that Black politicians – not least Barack Obama – often drop into when preaching to the choir on the campaign trail. And even though African Americans remain the most church-going demographic – with a 40% attendance rate that’s almost 10 points higher than the national average, according to a Barna survey – young Black people lag well behind older generations in their weekly church engagement. Well before the pandemic, Black churches were scrambling to capture these short attention spans with flashy PowerPoints, studio-grade musicianship, concert-quality light displays and similarly high production values. Increasingly, they’re finding themselves pitted against the mainstream likes of Kanye West, whose viral Sunday Service productions have only further blurred the line between spiritual and secular. Todd’s Sunday sermons, which have seen him set against an Imax-quality display, sometimes while standing on a stage pooled with water or in a driving artificial rain – are as ambitious as anything you’d see on a Vegas proscenium. Parishioners don’t just want a silver tongue, holy hands and a whiff of fire and brimstone. They want to feel it. There’s always been a performance expectation in the Black church. “I know stories of preachers who Palm Sunday rode donkeys into sanctuaries, hoping that the donkeys had cleaned their bowels before going on stage,” says Bill Lamar, pastor of Washington DC’s Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church. “The only difference between this young man [Todd] and the others is we’ve got technology now that makes stuff go viral.” Social media is just another stage. Gone are the days when pastors got by by penning bestsellers and hawking sermons on CD. The competition to win souls became more intense once Covid hit and church services were forced to shift to a streaming-only setup. “Churches that had younger clergy or younger people who were already leaning into a lot of the technological advances before Covid were really at an advantage,” says James, who also serves as associate conference minister for southern Pennsylvania’s United Church of Christ’s 66 affiliate members. “I had been encouraging our congregations to go virtual as far as worship services and giving three years before Covid.” Still, it’s not enough simply to minister to the internet. A preacher-influencer has to appeal in other ways. The Instagram account @PreachersNSneakers, which posts screenshots of pastors in their sneakers with the market price appended, boasts more than 269,000 followers. Among other clothes horses, the account has featured Todd in his Nike Air Fear of God 1s (up to $760 at post time). Even Paula White, Donald Trump’s one-time spiritual advisor, was singled out for wearing $785 Stella McCartney sneakers; in fact, this trend is hardly exclusive to Black preachers. To those who say the fashion photos images are just as likely to offend as inspire, recognize the posts for what they are: the new prosperity gospel. Not every preacher-influencer can pull a Creflo Dollar, a notorious old-school televangelist who raised eyebrows seven years ago with a six-minute video soliciting donations for a $65m private jet – a goal he had no problem meeting, by the way. Before cracking social media, some pastors attempted to proselytize through reality TV projects like Oxygen’s Preachers of LA, a sort of real husbands of the cloth that ran for two seasons less than a decade ago (and spawned a Detroit-based spin-off). But that can just as easily destroy an image as burnish it. Gray and Bryant’s separate forays into reality television have only invited tabloid scrutiny on personal indiscretions that contradict their stated beliefs. Todd, though, isn’t merely telegenic and tapped in. He can also deliver attention-arresting sermons that would seem to defy the evangelical practice of sermonizing with metaphors and parables “the way Jesus did”, says James, who believes He might have been leaning on visual aids too. “Think of the parable of the sower. Just imagine Jesus standing next to a field. So the people listening to that sermon might have literally been watching someone sow seeds. Or at least they were familiar with that process. If He did not have the physical illustration right there, He was painting a picture in their minds. That’s really been the old technique of preaching.” But these days, James says, preacher-influencers rely on visual examples to appeal audiences in the room and the online following. And each time one of James’s peers asks him how to strike that delicate balance, he offers the same recommendation: watch old-school televangelists work. “Whether you agree with their theology or not, they were really good at being present for the crowd that was in person and present for the crowd that’s on camera,” says James, adding that the video stream is just one piece of the internet play. “The chat section has really become the new Amen Corner for worship. At our church, we have a group of people in our production room who are literally just going through the chat responding to what people are saying. People will put prayer requests in the chat. Church is hybrid now, and you can’t make either group feel like they’re auxiliary.” Nor can a preacher-influencer get too shocking on the pulpit, at the risk of overshadowing their good intentions. Far less circulated than Todd’s expectorated miracle attempt was his efforts to raise more than $1m for the survivors of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. “God is a God of reparations,” he told parishioners last year during an outdoor service held over the weekend of Juneteenth. “Reparations means that somebody is going to take up the mantle and actually put into action the process of repairing something that was destroyed. If God is the God of reparations … and I’m one of God’s people … then I am responsible for being part of restoring what has been torn down.” That sermon would seem to prove this much about the modern preacher-influencer: their most meaningful impacts don’t have to be quite so heavy-handed.",News/World news,"Spit, screens and sneakers: the rise of the preacher-influencer",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/29/pastor-michael-todd-spit-preacher-influencer
1/30/2022,"Energy is vital to our daily lives. We need reliable supplies to heat our homes, to cook, to keep our food fresh, to power our transport systems, to illuminate our cities and to stay in communication with each other. Ensuring there are no significant disruptions to that provision is one of the most important tasks that a government must perform on behalf of its citizens. In recent months, it has become clear that serious strains are now being placed on energy security in the United Kingdom, however. Spiralling gas costs are causing considerable financial difficulties for thousands of households. At the same time, electricity supplies are now threatened because most of the UK’s ageing nuclear reactors, which currently provide 20% of our electricity, face closure in the next few years with little prospect, at present, of new atomic power plants being ready to fill the gap in lost output.  On top of these issues, an urgent overhaul of our use of fossil fuels is required if the country is to have any chance of reaching its goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050, a promise made by the government as part of its commitment to tackle climate change and to help halt the dangerous warming of our planet. At present, roughly half our electricity is generated by burning natural gas in power plants. About half of that comes to our shores from North Sea rigs whose overall output is dwindling as gas fields reach the end of their lives. The rest of our gas is imported from other nations; most of it is shipped from Qatar or the US or piped from Norway. Very little is imported from Russia, it should be noted. In addition, gas plays a dominant role in heating our homes, a reliance that cannot last for much longer if we are to meet our climate change obligations. In short, we need, as a matter of priority, to replace gas with electricity generated in a safe, renewable, environmentally friendly manner. The nation can achieve this goal in two ways: it can import more electricity from mainland Europe (around 6% of our power already comes via inter-connectors to France, the Netherlands and Ireland) or it can find alternative sources within the UK. The latter path is very much the preferable one, both in terms of establishing security for our energy supply while also ensuring this power is generated in a manner consistent with our carbon emission aspirations. Energy security and fighting climate change are inextricably linked, in other words. This transformation needs to be done as a matter of urgency, however, a point that appears to have escaped ministers whose attempts to reshape power use in the UK have already started to unravel. Consider the government’s green homes grant scheme for England. Hailed by Boris Johnson as a key plank in his green industrial revolution by helping the public make their homes more energy-efficient and less reliant on fossil fuel heating, it targeted a total of 600,000 homes for improvement. In the end, however, only 47,500 were upgraded. As Dame Meg Hillier, chair of the public accounts committee, put it last year: “This scheme was a slam dunk fail.” Such setbacks are alarming and underline the urgent need for ministers to provide the nation with a cogent, detailed set of proposals for generating power securely and sustainably while minimising energy waste. Several key issues need to be addressed to achieve these goals. The first is the creation of a system of smart grids. These local networks would distribute power generated from renewable energy sources to supplement mains supplies and reduce electricity bills. Establishing such a system should be seen as a priority for they offer the prospect of making maximum use of power generated within our shores at low cost. Properly insulating buildings would have a similar effect. Despite Johnson’s green homes initiative failure, efforts to make homes and workplaces more energy-efficient should be redoubled. It will not be possible to fit every house in Britain with a heat pump or solar panels. Nevertheless, making more houses and offices greener today will have critical impacts in coming years. Providing power when weather is gloomy and winds are non-existent is also key. At present, nuclear and gas-power plants provide that electricity. The disappearance of the latter over the coming decade will put more pressure on the UK to develop an efficient atomic power programme. Currently, our nuclear plans look piecemeal and unimpressive, despite last week’s announcement of a £100m investment to help develop the Sizewell C power station in Suffolk. Further research is also needed to find new, efficient ways to store energy, so power from renewable sources can be stored for those gloomy, windless days. We also need to find ways to capture and store carbon dioxide from old power plants and so extend their lives. Such developments will be crucial in providing the nation with a full range of options for generating its own power securely and cleanly. The alternative is to sit back and allow these issues to be resolved beyond our shores. In a world where energy will become ever more critical to national survival, that is not an option to be countenanced.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on Britain’s energy crisis | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/30/observer-view-britains-energy-crisis

HR After the opener’s explosive cliffhanger, Lana (Vicky McClure) is reeling from the aftermath of what happened to pal and fellow expo Joel Nutkins (Adrian Lester). But there’s no time for too much sentimentality – Lana has a summer reign of terror to get to the bottom of, with this episode providing some leads while maintaining that high Jed Mercurio tension. HR Dead of Night, 7pm, Talking Pictures TVThis 1945 portmanteau film is one of the greats of British horror, if only for the chilling final segment of its five tales-with-a-tale. The brilliant Michael Redgrave plays a tormented ventriloquist whose dummy starts to get ideas of its own about their partnership. The other stories – directed by the likes of Robert Hamer and Alberto Cavalcanti – feature a haunted mirror, premonitions of death and child ghosts in country houses, plus the bonus of Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne basically reprising their Charters and Caldicott double act from The Lady Vanishes. SW In the Heat of the Night, 10pm, BBC Two Norman Jewison’s 1967 crime drama is the late Sidney Poitier’s finest film – a fiery denunciation of racism wrapped up in a gripping murder mystery and decorated with a superb jazz-blues soundtrack from Quincy Jones. Poitier is Virgil “They call me Mister” Tibbs, a Philadelphia homicide detective passing through rural Mississippi who is roped in to helping bigoted sheriff Gillespie (Rod Steiger) investigate the death of a white industrialist. Poitier is magnetic and permanently on the boil, while Steiger nails the difficult shift from resentment of Tibbs to respect.

1/30/2022," An article about a reader who was wrongly pursued for an energy bill said the debt collection company, BW Legal, confirmed it had sent further payment demands after the customer disputed the bill. In fact, the company had said it did not contact the customer about the balance after that time, other than to request evidence of non-liability. We regret the error, which was made during editing (BW Legal is chasing a debt I don’t owe, 23 January, p63).  In early editions last week, an article said that Eric Williams’s seminal book, Capitalism and Slavery, first published in the US in 1944, “continued to be spurned by British publishers until 1966, when a small university press gave it a very limited print run”. In fact, the UK publishing house was André Deutsch, which published the work in 1964, with a number of reprints over the next 20 years (Shunned critique of Britain’s slavery role finally hits bookshops, p31). In correcting this for later editions, we misspelled the surnames of two more authors published by André Deutsch, Margaret Atwood and VS Naipaul.   A travel piece about sculpture trails (Time to get in shape, 23 January, Magazine, p43), which featured the New Art Centre at Roche Court in Wiltshire, referred to the Lord Nelson pub “in nearby Middleton”.

1/30/2022,"The question I walked in on my husband watching porn and now I feel extraordinarily hurt and abandoned. My grown-up children have left home and I have managed to have a rewarding career. However, having a good relationship always eluded me until I was in my 50s.  I have been married before and I am in my early 60s now. We have been together for a while. I thought we were ecstatically happy and that, at last, I was in a truly fulfilling and equal relationship. I now doubt all this, and have lost respect for my husband. We have tried to talk about it, and he is only sorry that I am upset and doesn’t seem sorry that he used porn. He must know women are often exploited and always objectified in these situations. He says his love for me is as it ever was, and says he’ll stop if I want, but I want him to want not to do it. I experienced a serious trauma when I was in my teens and have had bouts of depression since then. I have not been good at choosing the right men to have relationships with, but with years of counselling I managed to turn my life around. I really thought that this time, by being with a kind and interested man I had at last got it right, but now I’m unsure. I feel betrayed by my husband using porn. It is as though he has been cheating on me. Philippa’s answer I’m not saying using porn is right or wrong, because me declaring judgment on it won’t change anyone’s behaviour. It is more useful to understand it. And yes, I dislike the objectifying, potentially exploitative side of the porn industry. But I can also understand it’s nice to have a little private pleasure. A bit like having a lovely, satisfying poo that you wouldn’t necessarily tell anyone about. You mentioned your teenage trauma, so I’m thinking it is still relevant. What trauma can do is shatter previously held beliefs such as: “Most people are good and trustworthy.” After the trauma, you may have developed rigid rules like emergency measures that come with new beliefs such as, “I shouldn’t trust anyone.” I’m wondering whether discovering something new about your husband which is hard for you to understand means you’ve reverted to this type of emergency-mode way of thinking – thinking in very “all or nothing” terms. You’ve gone from “ecstatically happy” to what sounds like panic – that marrying was a mistake, as though your discovery may have reactivated this old trauma and tipped you into an emergency trauma-mode mindset. What you are doing is discovering something new about him. It’s a part of him, it’s not all of him. Some of us tend to assume that sex means the same thing to our partners that it does to us. This is not done consciously but in a sort of take-it-for-granted way, and it is often left unsaid. This is why it can be a great shock when differences are found. You might be feeling excluded because he kept this part of his sexual life a secret. Maybe you find it disgusting and feel contaminated by it. It might be tantamount to him having sex with someone else. But for him, porn is probably nothing to do with his real-life relationship with you, but instead about his relationship with himself. The thing to remember is that each of you will have formed different attitudes to relationships and to sex and to porn: this might be difficult to explain or talk about because both of you might not have been in the habit of putting non-conscious assumptions about sex or porn into words (perhaps not even to yourselves). But I want to encourage you to keep trying, so that each of you can understand the other. I don’t think you’ll ever be on exactly the same page, but I do think it is important that you both really understand what is on your respective pages and have sympathy for each other’s points of view. He has probably been watching porn in private moments all the time you have been together, and all the while you loved and trusted him and felt “ecstatically happy”. He may need private time to masturbate, but whether you want this to be kept secret from you is something else to talk about. There is a difference between privacy and secrecy. The former is OK and the latter can feel like betrayal. I hope you can find a way of talking about how you each do privacy, how you need it and how you use it. It might enrich your relationship. Porn can be destructive when it is addictive, but as he offered to give it up if you wanted him to, it does not sound like he has an addiction to it. Beware of seeing this issue in terms of just right and wrong, and keep the dialogue open. Porn is what the genitals enjoy in private. This might be very different to who we each are with each other.
