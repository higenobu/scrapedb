3/15/2022,"BEIJING (Reuters) -Mainland China reported 1,807 new local symptomatic COVID-19 cases on Sunday, the highest daily figure in two years and more than triple the caseload of the previous day, as surging infections in a northeastern province squeeze health resources. The number of domestically transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms reported for Saturday spiked from 476 the previous day, data from the National Health Commission showed on Sunday. The daily count included 114 people initially classified as asymptomatic who later developed symptoms. China's case count is far lower than those of many other countries, but the growing number could complicate Beijing's ""dynamic-clearance"" ambition to suppress contagion as quickly as possible. The surge prompted health authorities to allow the public to buy rapid self-test kits for the first time to help detect infections quickly, as some experts said China's earlier strategy based on nucleic acid test - requiring medical workers to take samples - had become harder with the fast-spreading Omicron variant. The northeastern province of Jilin reported 1,412 new local symptomatic cases on Saturday, accounting for 78% of the national total and up from 134 a day earlier. The increase ""showed that some local areas, facing a rapid rise of the epidemic, lacked the capacity to expand medical resources, resulting in limited admission of infections to centralized facilities within a short period of time,"" a Jilin provincial official told a news briefing. Authorities in Changchun, the provincial capital already under lockdown, have been conducting mass testing and working on turning an exhibition centre into a temporary hospital with 1,500 beds, according to the local official and state media reports. The southern tech hub of Shenzhen reported 60 new local cases with confirmed symptoms for Saturday, the city's highest since China contained the first outbreak in early 2020. Shenzhen will suspend public transport including buses and subways from Monday, and residents have been told not to leave the city unless necessary, as the city conducts three rounds of mass testing, the authorities said in a statement. All nine districts in Shenzhen have halted dining in restaurants, closed indoor entertainment venues and demanded that companies should have employees work from home this Monday to Friday if remote working is possible, with exceptions for those in essential sectors. Six officials with local government or Communist Party authorities in the southern city of Dongguan have been removed from their roles for doing a poor job in COVID prevention and control, state media said on Sunday. The China Development Forum, a high-level business gathering in Beijing that was originally scheduled for March 19 to 22, will be postponed indefinitely due to the COVID situation, the organiser said in a statement. The number of new locally transmitted asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, rose to 1,315 on Saturday from 1,048 a day earlier, the fourth consecutive day of increases, the NHC data showed. There were no new deaths, leaving the death toll at 4,636. As of March 12, mainland China had reported 115,466 cases with confirmed symptoms, including both local ones and those arriving from outside mainland.

3/15/2022,"The video appears to show a Ukrainian armored personal carrier damaging a Russian tank and destroying another. The incident appears to be in or near Mariupol, a Ukrainian port city being sieged by Russian forces. Despite their superior military and resources, Russian forces have yet to reach Kyiv, Ukraine's capital city. A video circulating online shows a Ukrainian amphibious vehicle damaging one piece of Russian armor and destroying another in the vicinity of Mariupol, a Ukrainian port city under siege by Russian forces. The video, posted by a Twitter account that tracks weapons in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, shows a Ukrainian BTR-4 damaging a Russian T-72B3M tank and destroying a BRM-1K armored vehicle. The Ukrainian BTR-4, known as ""Bucephalus,"" is an 8x8 wheeled armored personal carrier designed in Ukraine and first developed in 2008. The BTR-4 can be used as an armored vehicle in infantry units or to provide fire support in combat, and has a 30mm mounted gun on its roof that can be fired remotely. The T-72B3M is a tank in the service of Russia and Belarus, and was first rolled out in 2014 as an upgraded version of the T-72B3 battle tank. The BRM-1K is a Soviet-era armored reconnaissance vehicle that is mainly used for self-defense. Although Russia's military capabilities far outmatch those of Ukraine, the country is fighting back as best it can. Despite their superior military and resources, Russian forces have yet to enter Kyiv, Ukraine's capital city, since they launched their attack on February 24, and appear to be trying to encircle it. Insider was unable to independently confirm the location or time of the combat video, which appeared amid Russia's heavy barrage of Mariupol that forced locals to dig mass graves. According to Mariupol's city council, 2,187 residents have been killed since Russia's invasion, Al Jazeera reported. Along with continuous bombings in civilan areas, including a maternity hospital, Russians have sieged the city and cut it off from sources of water, electricity, and heat. Food and water are also running scarce, with some reports that people are draining radiators for water, according to the BBC. ""In [the last] 24 hours, there were at least 22 bombings of the civilian city. Over 100 bombs have been thrown on Mariupol already,"" Mariupol's city council said in an online statement.

The head and first two body segments are red, and the other body segments are typically black with traces of green. With its yellow legs, it looks like something radioactive. Any of its 20-odd legs can deliver venom, excreting poison into fresh cuts with its feet. The centipede snacks on lizards and can snatch flying insects out of the air — and its sharp, painful bites can lead to swelling, headaches and nausea for humans — partly because you're thinking, ""I can't believe that thing just bit me.""

3/15/2022,"The besieged city of Mariupol is suffering such a devastating toll that street cleaners are collecting the bodies of civilians killed during the Russian onslaught, the city's deputy mayor has said. The city, situated in the south-west of Ukraine, has found itself at the centre of the invasion, with 2,500 residents reportedly killed as a result of the Russian invasion. ""We can't bury [the victims] in private graves, as those are outside the city and the perimeter is controlled by Russian troops,"" Mariupol's deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov told the BBC. Heavy Russian shelling has prevented any mass evacuation from the besieged port city, despite efforts to open safe routes for civilians to escape through. Promised ceasefires have been routinely broken by Russian troops. On Sunday, the city council said the civilian death toll had reached 2,100. By Monday, presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said that figure had risen to 2,500. Orlov said he could not give a total for dead civilians buried in mass graves, but that 67 bodies were at one site. ""Some we can't identify but some had documents,"" he said, and then went on to reveal that the situation was so dire street cleaners and road repair teams were having to collect bodies in the streets because municipal services have collapsed. He added: ""Some people were killed during those collections. We've had no electricity, or heating, sanitation, water, food for 11 days."" Orlov said that thousands of residents are hiding in cellars beneath the city, and some are burying family members privately in courtyards or gardens.

So Ukraine has no more children.” On Monday it was announced that a pregnant woman who had been pictured clasping her bloodstained stomach as paramedics carried her through the wreckage of the hospital after the bomb attack, had died. According to the Associated Press news agency, the woman was rushed to another hospital where doctors worked to keep her alive. Realising she was losing her baby, medics said she cried out to them:, “Kill me now!”. Surgeon Timur Marin said the woman's pelvis had been crushed and her hip detached. Medics delivered the baby via cesarean section, but it showed “no signs of life,” the surgeon said.

3/15/2022,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -A British businessman living in Mexico was killed in front of his teenage daughter by gunmen who opened fire on his car near the popular tourist destination Playa del Carmen, according to a state government source and local media. The victim of the deadly attack on Saturday was Chris Cleave, 54, the source said. Cleave, a permanent resident of Mexico since 2013, was driving on a highway near Playa del Carmen in Quintana Roo state when his car was approached by two gunmen who opened fire. His daughter suffered minor, non life-threatening injuries. Two suspects were arrested later Saturday on suspicion of participation in the killing, the prosecutor's office of Quintana Roo said. A gun that may have been used was found in their possession at the time of the arrest, the office said. The prosecutor's office and local police did not respond to requests for further information or confirmation of Cleave's identity on Sunday. In a statement, the British embassy said, ""We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Mexico and are in touch with the Mexican police/local authorities."" The embassy did not confirm his identity. Cleave was a businessman who worked in real estate and had recently been threatened by a local gang, according to local media reports. A Facebook page in his name showed dozens of messages from friends on Sunday, expressing shock at the news of his death. Mexico's government stationed National Guard troops in Quintana Roo late last year in response to a rise in violence linked to organized crime, including gunfights that killed two foreign tourists and a beachfront gang slaying that sent hotel guests fleeing for their lives.

3/15/2022,"What's a tactical nuclear bomb? It is — drumroll please — a nuclear bomb. But please don't worry; they're small ones. Some are ""only"" the size of the weapons that flattened Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Some are smaller than that. Some are so small they can be launched as artillery shells. Some can be dropped by airplanes or put on the tips of short(ish)-range missiles. Some tactical nukes could even be carried on your back, though it probably wouldn't be good for you. There's been a fair amount of conversation online about the ""tactical weapons gap."" The United States has 230 of these smaller nukes, with reports that around 100 of those are in Europe. Russia has as many 2,000, most already in the European theater, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has seemed to indicate a willingness to use them, most likely if he felt himself to be losing in Ukraine, or if NATO joined the fight. So, what would this gap really mean? Would it be decisive in a war? No. ""If we were to unleash a couple of hundred versus a couple of thousand [tactical nukes] it would be a distinction without a difference,"" Retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Robert Latiff told The Week. The sheer destructive power of each side renders the details significantly irrelevant. Tit for tat, by the time the U.S. is outgunned, we're at 460 nukes launched. It's enough to destroy every tank in this war. It's certainly enough to kill millions of civilians. The Russians could keep going from there, but now we're into madness land. And having run out of the little nukes, and afraid of losing, would we really stop without resorting to one — just one — strategic bomb? If that happens, a war like we've seen before becomes a war unlike anything we've ever seen before. A tactical nuclear strike has taken us into an unwinnable strategic nuclear war. The truth is no one is sure what would happen if even one of these tactical nuclear bombs were used in war. According to Latiff, the international reaction would differ if it happened in Ukraine itself or, say, in Poland. But the only people who really know how escalation would work aren't telling. The strategy for reacting to a small nuclear provocation is top secret, Latiff said. Does that uncertainty make it more likely or less Putin would use one of these bombs? He may bank on a sub-nuclear NATO reaction. Or he may hold back because he can't bank on that. There are a lot of generals paid to think about these things.

3/15/2022,"China appears to be losing the battle to contain COVID-19, but it’s not yet ready to admit defeat. Facing the worst national outbreak since the first wave of the pandemic, authorities have introduced lockdown restrictions in cities across the country, with production lines falling idle in the tech hub of Shenzhen and offices shuttered in the financial capital Shanghai. Under President Xi Jinping, the Chinese government has stuck to a strict zero-COVID policy since the virus emerged in Wuhan in late 2019, locking down entire cities whenever cases emerge and using mass testing and strict quarantining to bring local outbreaks under control. But Chinese virologists say the arrival of the Omicron variant and its new “stealth” subvariant—both of which appear to evade China’s Sinovac vaccine—could leave that policy in tatters. For those in the Americas or Europe, the case numbers reported from China still seem pretty small: Authorities confirmed 1,337 new locally transmitted cases in mainland China on Monday. By contrast, the U.K. is currently seeing more than 200,000 cases a day, according to the main COVID tracker. But the example of Hong Kong, the former British colony that is officially semi-autonomous, is worrying. Omicron appears to be running virtually unchecked through the population of the island territory, which has registered an average of 40,000 cases a day over the past week despite widespread vaccination. Worst-hit on the mainland is the northeastern province of Jilin, bordering North Korea, where many residents are restricted to their homes except for grocery shopping trips every other day. Jilin has recorded more than 4,000 cases in the past fortnight. But multiple smaller outbreaks have also been recorded. Shenzhen, a city of 17.5 million people bordering Hong Kong, registered 66 new cases on Saturday, prompting authorities to suspend public transport, close factories—among them the huge Foxconn plant that produces the Apple iPhone. Residents have been told to stay home for the next week except when they are called for three rounds of compulsory testing. A prominent infectious-disease expert from Shanghai, Zhang Wenhong, said in an article for the Chinese business outlet Caixin that the outbreak was being driven by the Omicron BA.2 “stealth” subvariant, the most infectious lineage yet of the SARS-Cov-2 virus. The Only Way to Resolve the Wuhan ‘Lab Leak’ Controversy Zhang, whose plain-spoken appeals for people to put up with lockdown restrictions at the beginning of the pandemic made him a prominent figure, said that the case numbers suggested the beginning of an “exponential rise”—but China had no option but to try to contain the virus. “If our country opens up quickly now, it will cause a large number of infections in people in a short period of time,” Zhang wrote, according to a translation carried by the Associated Press. “No matter how low the death rate is, it will still cause a run on medical resources and a short-term shock to social life, causing irreparable harm to families and society.” Foxconn, Apple’s manufacturing partner, said it would use its “diversified production sites in China” to minimize the impact of the Shenzhen lockdown. But from a wider economic viewpoint, the lockdowns—both in Shenzhen and the industrial hub of Dongguan—could hardly have come at a worse time. Panic selling saw Chinese tech stocks listed on the Hong Kong fall 11 percent on Monday—their worst single-day fall since the 2008 crash—because of wider fears that China could be dragged into the conflict in Ukraine, or that Chinese companies doing business in Russia might face Western sanctions. If China sticks with its zero-COVID policy, despite the spread of Omicron, one option is to insist that manufacturers introduce “closed management” systems, where workers live and work in a COVID-free “bubble.” The Chinese used such a system to protect last month’s Winter Olympics in Beijing, where staff and volunteers wore hazmat suits to marshal and test visiting athletes and even robots to feed them. Making that work in a megacity like Shenzhen or Shanghai would be harder. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox. Sign up now.

3/15/2022,"Jewel, a friend and business partner of Hsieh, reportedly tried several times to save the exec. Hsieh died in a house fire in November 2020 after months of deteriorating mental health. A new biography said Jewel visited his home months before his death. The singer-songwriter Jewel made multiple attempts to save Tony Hsieh, the former Zappos CEO, after a harrowing 2020 visit to his Park City, Utah, home shed light on his rapidly deteriorating mental state before his death, according to a new biography. Hsieh's death, which had been ruled an accident from injuries suffered in a house fire, came after months of troubling behavior from the entrepreneur. Jewel, a longtime friend and business partner of Hsieh, was among those close to him in the time leading to his death. According to a forthcoming biography of Hsieh excerpted in The Wall Street Journal — ""Happy at Any Cost, The Revolutionary Vision and Fatal Quest of Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh"" by Kirsten Grind and Katherine Sayre — Jewel visited his mansion in August 2020, where he had been hosting a rotating roster of high-profile guests. When she arrived, the report said, she found it in disarray, covered in dog feces and wax from hundreds of burning candles left around the house, as sinks and showers ran continuously. The singer reportedly found Hsieh in the backyard, emaciated and sitting in a chair in his underwear surrounded by canisters of nitrous oxide, which he had been openly misusing at the time. According to The Journal, he then presented her with a box on which he had written a series of unintelligible numbers he said was ""the algorithm for world peace."" Jewel — who had previously worked with Hsieh to develop a mental-health program for Zappos employees — learned that Hsieh had also stopped sleeping and claimed he had ""hacked"" the ability to need it. Concerned, she spoke with Hsieh's staff and head of security, who said they had been following orders to leave the tech exec and his home in its state. ""If he kills himself and everyone else in there from a huge fire, you can't say you weren't warned,"" Jewel told the security officer, according to the biography. The new details come after a December 2020 Forbes report found Jewel had sent Hsieh a letter through FedEx shortly after leaving Park City that August. ""I am going to be blunt,"" she wrote in the letter, which was reviewed by Forbes. ""I need to tell you that I don't think you are well and in your right mind. I think you are taking too many drugs that cause you to disassociate."" She continued: ""The people you are surrounding yourself with are either ignorant or willing to be complicit in you killing yourself."" Hsieh would die a few months later from injuries suffered in a house fire in Connecticut in November 2020, after he was either trapped or barricaded in the basement. Though his death was ruled an accident, the details around it remain under investigation.

3/15/2022,"A Ukrainian police officer at the gruesome scene where an American journalist was shot and killed and at least two others were wounded by Russian forces Sunday had a gut-wrenching message. ""Tell America, tell the world, what they did to a journalist,"" the outraged officer told PBS correspondent Jane Ferguson from the roadside scene near Irpin, outside of Kyiv, where the body of American journalist and former The New York Times contributor Brent Renaud was lying beneath a blanket. AMERICAN JOURNALIST KILLED AT CHECKPOINT, RUSSIAN AIRSTRIKE KILLS 35, WOUNDS 135: LIVE UPDATES Renaud was not on assignment for The Times in Ukraine but contributed to the newspaper in the past, most recently in 2015, a NYT spokeswoman told Fox News Digital. He and another journalist were reportedly headed to Irpin to take photos of refugees fleeing the area and were offered a ride. Initial reports said Russian forces fired upon their car, but Fox News has not independently confirmed who fired. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT Pravda Gerashchenko, an adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, shared a video on Telegram purportedly showing the wounded American journalist lying on a hospital bed in the capital, telling a spokeswoman for the Okhmatdyt Hospital recording him that he was separated from his colleague, Renaud, who was left behind. Ukrainian Parliament also shared the video on Twitter. The man, who said his name was Juan and he was from the U.S., described how both he and Renaud approached a second bridge in the car and crossed a checkpoint near Irpin when they were fired upon. Speaking while medical staff attended to his wound, he said he was brought to the hospital by an ambulance and did not know the status of his colleague. Initial reports identified him as Juan Arredondo, and an Instagram account with the same name said he was a journalist for National Geographic and an adjunct professor at Columbia University. Fox News has not independently identified him or his employment status, and requests for comment to NatGeo and Columbia went unanswered Sunday. In an appearance on CNN Sunday, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said he just heard reports about an American journalist killed before coming on air and still needed to confirm information. ""If in fact an American journalist was killed, it is a shocking and horrifying event,"" Sullivan told CNN host Dana Bash. ""It is one more example of the brutality of Vladimir Putin and his forces. They’ve targeted schools and mosques and hospitals and journalists. And it is why we are working so hard to impose severe consequences on him and to try to help the Ukrainians with every form of military assistance we can muster to be able to push back against the onslaught of these Russian forces."" The Main Directorate of the National Police in Kyiv Region first tweeted photos purportedly showing a bloodied Renaud, his U.S. passport and his photo ID badge for The New York Times enclosed in a holder labeled U.S. peacemaker. In another video from the scene of the shooting, Ukrainian police officer Alexander Bugai said that in addition to 51-year-old Renaud being killed, two others were wounded. It wasn’t immediately clear if a third journalist was shot or if it was the driver of the car injured. A graphic photo included in the post appeared to show a gunshot wound that pierced Renaud’s skull. According to his bio on IMBD, Renaud was a Peabody and DuPont Award winning filmmaker and spent the past two decades producing films and television programs with his brother Craig. ""The Renaud Brothers are best known for telling humanistic stories from the World's hot spots and their projects have covered the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the earthquake in Haiti, political turmoil in Egypt and Libya, the fight for Mosul, extremism in Africa, cartel violence in Mexico, and the youth refugee crisis in Central America,"" according to the biography.

3/15/2022,"By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States told allies in NATO and several Asian countries on Monday that China had signaled willingness to provide military and economic aid to Russia, at Moscow's request, to support its war in Ukraine, a U.S. official said as top U.S. and Chinese officials met in Rome. The message, sent in a diplomatic cable and delivered in person by intelligence officials, also said China was expected to deny those plans, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan was meeting with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi in Rome, following his warning that China faced consequences if it helped Russia evade Western sanctions and amid reports Russia had asked China for military equipment. Russia denied the reports, saying it has sufficient military resources to fulfill all of its aims in Ukraine. China's foreign ministry spokesperson described the reports as ""disinformation."" Russia began its invasion of neighbor Ukraine on Feb. 24, calling it a ""special operation"" to demilitarize and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for a war of aggression. Disclosure of both Russia's request and China's response is part of a deliberate strategy by U.S. officials to counter disinformation by being far more open about intelligence matters than usual, the U.S. official said. The diplomatic cable, or demarche, was relatively vague about China's willingness to provide arms to Russia, but intelligence officials were expected to share more details during in-person briefings, said the official. Sullivan on Sunday said Washington was watching closely to see how far China provided economic or material support to Russia. ""We are communicating directly, privately to Beijing, that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them,"" Sullivan said. ""We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country, anywhere in the world.""

3/15/2022,"By Jacqueline Thomsen (Reuters) - As thousands of would-be fighters from outside the country volunteer to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia's invasion, some may also face legal consequences in their home countries. Citizens of Canada, Georgia, India, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States are among the volunteers, Reuters and other media organizations have reported. Below is a summary of some of the laws governing foreigners who have signed up for Ukraine's ""international legion."" IS IT LEGAL FOR AMERICANS TO VOLUNTEER? U.S. citizens are not barred from serving in another country's military, the State Department's website says. Serving as an officer or fighting against a country that is at peace with the United States can be grounds for giving up citizenship voluntarily, but Supreme Court precedent says foreign military service alone cannot be used to strip Americans of citizenship. A separate U.S. law dating back to 1794, the Neutrality Act, prohibits citizens from making war against foreign governments at peace with Washington and carries a prison sentence of up to three years. The law, which could technically apply to volunteer military action against Russia, was used to prosecute Americans involved in an attempted coup in Gambia in 2014. But otherwise it has been rarely enforced in modern history, according to David Malet, a professor at American University in Washington, D.C. ""Absent links to domestic terrorism, it’s hard for me to imagine Americans being prosecuted for going to Ukraine,"" Malet said. WHAT ABOUT AUSTRALIAN, BRITISH AND INDIAN VOLUNTEERS? Britons traveling to Ukraine to fight could be subject to prosecution upon return, according to a UK Foreign Office travel advisory https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ukraine/safety-and-security last updated Wednesday. Asked by Reuters what charges would apply to UK volunteers, a spokesperson for the British Foreign Office declined to comment. The United Kingdom's Foreign Enlistment Act, last updated in 1870, blocks citizens from joining foreign militaries fighting countries at peace with Britain, but it has not been applied to modern conflicts. The UK Foreign Secretary initially voiced support for citizen volunteers to fight in Ukraine, but later warned against any travel there. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison has urged his country’s citizens not to join the military fight in Ukraine, telling reporters last month that there are ""uncertainties"" about the legal position of foreign civilian combatants. The Indian Ministry of Home Affairs did not respond to a request for comment about the legality of Indian citizens joining the Ukraine forces. In a case involving Indians traveling to Iraq in 2015, the ministry told the Delhi High Court that allowing Indians to participate in another country's conflict ""would lead to the allegation that the Indian government is promoting terrorism in other countries."" HAVE ANY COUNTRIES GIVEN THE ALL-CLEAR? Germany has said it will not prosecute volunteers who join the fighting, and Danish and Latvian leaders said they would allow their citizens to volunteer. Canadian defense minister Anita Anand has said whether Canadians volunteer is ""an individual decision."" WHAT IF FOREIGN FIGHTERS ARE CAPTURED IN UKRAINE? International law requires Russian forces to treat foreign fighters as prisoners of war, regardless of their nationality, said Daphné Richemond-Barak, a professor with the Lauder School of Government, Diplomacy and Strategy in Israel. That means Russian soldiers must give volunteers who are captured food, water and medical treatment. However, a Russian Defense Ministry spokesman last week said Western ""mercenaries"" fighting for Ukraine would not be treated as lawful combatants and would face criminal prosecution or worse, according to Russian news agency TASS. COULD VOLUNTEERS BE PROSECUTED FOR WARTIME CONDUCT? Because volunteers will be fighting as members of the Ukrainian army, they are unlikely to face charges in their home country over their specific actions in the war, with the exception of prosecution for war crimes or similar conduct, experts say.

3/15/2022,"By Andrea Shalal, Michael Martina and David Brunnstrom WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who is due to meet with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi in Rome on Monday, warned Beijing it would ""absolutely"" face consequences if it helped Moscow evade sweeping sanctions over the war in Ukraine. Russia asked China for military equipment after its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, sparking concern in the White House that Beijing may undermine Western efforts to help Ukrainian forces defend their country, several U.S. officials said. Sullivan plans in his meeting with Yang to make Washington's concerns clear while mapping out the consequences and growing isolation China would face globally if it increases its support of Russia, one U.S. official said, without providing details. Asked about Russia's request for military aid, first reported by the Financial Times, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington, said: ""I've never heard of that."" He said China found the current situation in Ukraine ""disconcerting"" and added: ""We support and encourage all efforts that are conducive to a peaceful settlement of the crisis."" Liu said ""utmost efforts should be made to support Russia and Ukraine in carrying forward negotiations despite the difficult situation to produce a peaceful outcome."" Sullivan told CNN on Sunday that Washington believed China was aware Russia was planning some action in Ukraine before the invasion took place, although Beijing may not have understood the full extent of what was planned. After the invasion began, Russia sought both military equipment and support from China, the U.S. officials said. Sullivan told CNN Washington was watching closely to see to what extent Beijing provided economic or material support to Russia, and would impose consequences if that occurred. ""We are communicating directly, privately to Beijing, that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them,"" Sullivan said. ""We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country, anywhere in the world."" The meeting, planned for some time, is part of a broader effort by Washington and Beijing to maintain open channels of communication and manage competition between the world's two largest economies, a senior Biden administration official said. No specific outcomes were expected, the source added, speaking on condition of anonymity. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the meeting's focus was to ""implement the important consensus"" reached during the virtual meeting held between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden in November, which discussed ""strategic stability"" and arms control issues. The two sides will exchange views on U.S.-China relations as well as international and regional issues of common concern, he said in a statement published on the ministry's website. Wang Huiyao, head of a Beijing think tank and adviser to the Chinese government, warned of ""an escalatory spiral"" in a column published in the New York Times on Sunday, and said China was ""uniquely positioned to act as a neutral mediator between a Western-supported Ukraine and Russia"" to end the war. ""Unpalatable as some in the West may find the idea, it is time to offer the Russian leader an off-ramp with China’s help,"" Wang wrote. U.S. officials were skeptical about the proposal given China's ties to Russia and its spreading of misinformation related to the war. CHINA, RUSSIA TRADE TIES The United States on Saturday said it would rush up to $200 million worth of additional weapons to Ukrainian forces as they try to defend against Russian shelling in the largest war in Europe since World War Two. Washington and its allies have imposed sweeping, unprecedented sanctions against Russia and banned its energy imports, while providing billions of dollars of military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. Individually and together they have appealed to China, Gulf nations and others that have failed to condemn the Russian invasion to join in isolating Russia from the global economy. Beijing, a key trading partner of Russia, has refused to call Russia's actions an invasion, although Xi last week did call for ""maximum restraint"" in Ukraine after a virtual meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron. Xi also expressed concern about the impact of sanctions on global finance, energy supplies, transportation and supply chains, amid growing signs that Western sanctions are limiting China's ability to buy Russian oil. However, Hu Xijin, former editor-in-chief of the state-backed Chinese Global Times newspaper, said on Twitter: ""If Sullivan thinks he can persuade China to participate in sanctions against Russia, he will be disappointed."" While in Rome, Sullivan will also meet with Luigi Mattiolo, diplomatic adviser to Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, to continue coordinating the strong global response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""war of choice,"" the U.S. official said. Washington and the Group of Seven advanced economies on Friday ratcheted up pressure on Russia by calling for revoking its ""most favored nation"" trade status, which would allow them to jack up tariffs on Russian goods. Trade made up about 46% of Russia's economy in 2020, much of that with China, its biggest export destination.

""The Russian invasion of Ukraine is greatly changing the appearance of the international community.

3/15/2022,"COMRAT, Moldova (AP) — Across the border from war-engulfed Ukraine, tiny, impoverished Moldova — an ex-Soviet republic now looking eagerly Westward — has watched with trepidation as the Russian invasion unfolds. In Gagauzia, a small, autonomous part of the country that's traditionally felt closer to the Kremlin than the West, people would normally back Russia, which they never wanted to leave when Moldova gained independence. But this time, most have trouble identifying with either side in the war. Anna Koejoglo says she's deeply conflicted. “I have sisters (in Ukraine), I have nephews there, my own son is in Kyiv,” the 52-year-old said, quickly adding that her other, younger, son is studying in Russia. “My heart is (broken), my insides are burning,” she told The Associated Press. Koejoglo is one of Moldova’s 160,000 Gagauz, an Orthodox Christian people of Turkic origin who were settled there by the Russian Empire in the 19th century. They make up over 80% of Gagauzia's population, but only 5% of Moldova’s 2.6 million people. In the early 1990s, when landlocked Moldova voted to leave the Soviet Union, its Gagauz and Russian minorities wanted to stay. But unlike Russian-backed separatists in eastern Moldova who took up arms in 1992 to establish the unrecognized, breakaway Trans-Dniester area — which Russia essentially controls, maintaining some 1,500 troops there — the Gagauz in the south chose to compromise. In 1994, they reached an agreement with the government in Moldova’s capital, Chisinau, settling for a high degree of autonomy. Still, Gagauzia has maintained a strong relationship with Russia, where many Gagauz find education and job opportunities. Its population generally opposes the pro-Western shift embraced by ethnic Moldovans who account for 75% of the country’s people. For Peotr Sarangi, a 25-year-old Gagauz, the old ties still hold strong. “(The) Gagauzian population supports Russia more, many remain pro-Russian,” he said. Although Moldova is neutral militarily and has no plans to join NATO, it formally applied for EU membership when the Russian invasion began. It's also taken in about a tenth of the more than 2.3 million Ukrainians who fled their country for safety. Ilona Manolo, a 20-year-old Gagauz, has no qualms in laying the blame with Moscow. “I think that Russia is at fault. ... I’d rather support (Ukrainian) refugees,” than Russia, she said. There's similar sentiment elsewhere among Moldova's rich patchwork of ethnic minorities — even expressed by ethnic Russians who live outside the separatist region of Trans-Dniester. One of the latter group, Nikola Sidorov, described the invasion of Ukraine as a “terrible thing."" He said he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin “went too far (and) needs to calm down.” The 79-year-old added that the issue has become a subject of heated debates among his ethnic kin in Moldova’s second largest city, Balti, where ethnic Russians make up some 15% of the population. An ethnic Ukrainian who lives in Balti said her sympathies were divided. “I’m very sorry for the people of Ukraine ... but I also feel sorry for Russians,” said Iulia Popovic, 66. “I understand that it is all (happening because of) politics and that the situation is very difficult.” ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the Ukraine crisis at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,Invasion jolts Russia's friends in tiny West-leaning Moldova,https://news.yahoo.com/invasion-jolts-russias-friends-tiny-095941132.html
3/15/2022,"Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo claims “some people” have told her that the Biden administration sees Vladimir Putin as “a partner,” not “as the enemy” – and people on social media are fighting mad about that nonsense. “I was on the phone all weekend with various people about this conflict right now,” she said on Sunday’s “Fox and Friends” when asked about Russia’s attack on Ukraine. “What I took away from all of my phone calls is the strategy of this administration has been underwhelming and not enough.” Bartiromo went on to say, “It seems that there is a predetermined outcome here in place, and that is a slow death for Ukraine and President Zelenskyy, as the Russian forces continue to inch closer.

3/15/2022,"DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar's foreign minister will travel to Moscow on Sunday for discussions on the Iran nuclear talks and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a source familiar with the visit said. The source said Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, whose gas producing country is a U.S. ally, would meet with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov. Eleven month-old talks in Vienna to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal face the prospect of collapse after a last-minute Russian demand forced world powers to pause negotiations despite having a largely completed text. Russia wants guarantees that its trade with Iran will not be affected by sanctions imposed on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine - a demand Western powers say is unacceptable and Washington has insisted it will not agree to. Sheikh Mohammed on Saturday discussed the nuclear talks in separate phone calls with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, Qatar's ministry of foreign affairs said in a tweet. The talks in Vienna seek to bring Iran back into compliance with the pact's restrictions on its rapidly advancing nuclear activities and bring the United States back into the accord it left in 2018 under former President Donald Trump. On Thursday, Qatar's ruling emir met with Bektum Rostam, a special envoy for Ukraine's president, to discuss diplomatic efforts to end the war, Qatar's state news agency reported.
