3/22/2022,"BEIJING (AP) — The crash of a Boeing 737-800 passenger jet in China’s southwest started a fire big enough to be seen from space and forced rescuers to search a rugged, remote mountainside. One day after the China Eastern Airlines flight plunged from the sky, there are more questions than answers. ___ WHAT CAUSED THE CRASH? The cause is unknown. Flight 5735 was at 29,000 feet (8,800 meters) on Monday afternoon when it went into a dive about an hour into its flight, according to flight-tracking website FlightRadar24.com. The plane plunged to 7,400 feet (2,200 meters) before regaining about 1,200 feet (360 meters), then dived again. It crashed into the side of a mountain in a remote, forested area outside the city of Wuzhou. State media and Chinese regulators gave no indication the pilot reported trouble or other information that might shed light on the cause of the disaster. The plane stopped transmitting data 96 seconds after it started to fall. Rescue workers planned to use drones in the search for the plane’s black boxes, which should contain information from instruments and sound from the cockpit. Confirming the cause of a plane crash sometimes takes months or years due to the need to gather badly damaged debris and examine specialized technical factors. ___ HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE ABOARD? DID ANY SURVIVE? The plane was carrying 123 passengers and nine crew members from the city of Kunming in China's southwest to Guangzhou, an export hub in the southeast. No survivors have been found as rescuers search the rugged, charred mountainside in the semitropical Guangxi region. No foreigners are believed to have been on board. Two Chinese companies said their employees were on the flight, including the CFO of Guangzhou-based Dinglong Culture Co. whose interests range from mining to TV and movie production. Family members gathered in closed-off waiting areas at the airports in both Guangzhou and Kunming. Chinese news reports said five hotels with 700 rooms had been requisitioned closer to the crash site for family members. ___ IS THIS THE SAME BOEING MODEL INVOLVED IN EARLIER CRASHES THAT RESULTED IN ITS GROUNDING? No. The plane that crashed was a Boeing 737-800, not the Boeing 737 Max, a newer model that was temporarily grounded worldwide following two deadly crashes in Indonesia in 2018 and Ethiopia in 2019. The widely used Boeing 737-800 has been flying since 1998 and has an excellent safety record, said Hassan Shahidi, president of the Flight Safety Foundation. They have been involved in 22 accidents that damaged the planes beyond repair and killed 612 people. China Eastern grounded all of its 737-800s after the crash, China's Transport Ministry said. The Boeing 737 Max, which entered service in 2017, was grounded by regulators following the two crashes. They were blamed on a computer system that pushed the nose downward in flight and couldn’t be overridden by pilots. Airlines were allowed to resume using the 737 Max after Boeing redesigned the system in a process overseen by regulators from the United States, Europe, China and the Middle East.",World/Associated Press,EXPLAINER: What is known about the China Eastern plane crash,https://news.yahoo.com/explainer-known-china-eastern-plane-064800852.html
3/22/2022,"Not much can get between Texans and their trucks. Not even a tornado. A young driver of a 2004 red Chevrolet Silverado 1500 crew cab truck was suddenly in the throes of a tornado Monday on Texas 95 in Elgin. Footage of the harrowing scene was caught by several storm chasers, including Brian Emfinger, who posted video on social media. The 2.5 ton truck was flipped over onto its right side and spun 360 degrees as debris flew wildly across the highway. The violent wind eventually flipped the truck back upright. Amazingly, the driver, who storm chaser Marcus Reynolds estimated to be about a 16 to 17 year old boy, kept driving down the road. The driver suffered only a cut on his arm, according to Reynolds, who said he let the boy use his phone to call his parents. The tornado was classified as an EF-2, the fourth-strongest level of tornado, according to Reynolds. “This is a story about a red truck and a tornado…. I CANNOT believe they drove away like that,” Emfinger posted with his video footage. “Tornado crossing the road in front of me near Elgin, TX. The debris is from a mobile home that was destroyed. One person was taken away by ambulance.” Elgin is about 25 miles northeast of Austin. Tornadoes struck other parts of the state during Monday’s storms, including Round Rock and Jacksboro.",U.S./Fort Worth Star-Telegram,"‘Can’t believe they drove away.’ Video shows Texas tornado flip, spin around Chevy truck",https://news.yahoo.com/t-believe-drove-away-video-100000599.html
3/22/2022,"(Reuters) - Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov, a co-winner of last year's Nobel Peace Prize, said on Tuesday he would donate his Nobel medal to be auctioned to raise funds for Ukrainian refugees. The Novaya Gazeta newspaper, where Muratov is editor-in-chief, in early March said it would remove material on Russia's military actions in Ukraine from its website because of censorship, in response to threats of criminal prosecution of journalists and citizens who veer from the government's official line. ""Novaya Gazeta and I have decided to donate the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize Medal to the Ukrainian Refugee Fund,"" an article published with Muratov's name said. ""There are already over 10 million refugees. I ask the auction houses to respond and put up for auction this world-famous award."" Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces. Muratov and Novaya Gazeta, a newspaper critical of the Kremlin, said five things needed to be done right away: ""Stop combat fire, exchange prisoners, release the bodies of the dead, provide humanitarian corridors and assistance, and support refugees."" Muratov, who won the award jointly with Maria Ressa of the Philippines, co-founder of news site Rappler, dedicated his Nobel prize last year to six of the newspaper's journalists who had been murdered for their work.
