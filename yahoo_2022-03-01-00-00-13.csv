Transport Canada said it was launching an investigation into Aeroflot's conduct. Russia's flagship carrier Aeroflot violated Canada's newly-announced ban on Russian airplanes entering the country's airspace, regulator Transport Canada said on Sunday. ""We are aware that Aeroflot flight 111 violated the prohibition put in place earlier today on Russian flights using Canadian airspace,"" Transport Canada tweeted. The flight took off from Miami, Florida, at 3:12 p.m. and landed in Moscow at 9:54 a.m. local time, according to plane-tracking site FlightRadar24. The regulator said in a second tweet that it was launching an investigation into Aeroflot's conduct and Canada's air-traffic control service provider Nav Canada. Nav Canada told Reuters that Aeroflot entered Canada's airspace on Sunday. ""We will not hesitate to take appropriate enforcement action and other measures to prevent future violations,"" Transport Canada tweeted. Canada on Sunday joined a group of nations that have shut off their airspace to all Russian aircraft in response to Moscow's decision to send troops into Ukraine. Canada's transport minister Omar Alghabra announced the ban was ""effective immediately"" in a tweet at 9 a.m EST on Sunday. Ottawa prohibited Russian-owned, chartered or operated aircraft from entering Canadian airspace, including the airspace above Canada's territorial waters, the government said on Sunday, per a government press release. ""We will hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked attacks against Ukraine,"" Alghabra said. Aeroflot announced on its website on Monday that it had canceled flights to Los Angeles, Miami, New York, and Washington until at least March 2 because of Canada's decision to close its airspace to Russian planes. Aeroflot didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. The UK, the European Union, Estonia, Poland, Romania, Moldova, and the Czech Republic have banned all Russian airlines and airplanes from operating in their airspace after President Vladimir Putin order troops into Ukraine last week.

3/1/2022,"By Christopher Bing (Reuters) - Security researchers with U.S. cybersecurity firm Symantec said they have discovered a “highly sophisticated” Chinese hacking tool that has been able to escape public attention for more than a decade. The discovery was shared with the U.S. government in recent months, who have shared the information with foreign partners, said a U.S. official. Symantec, a division of chipmaker Broadcom, published its research about the tool, which it calls Daxin, on Monday. “It’s something we haven’t seen before,” said Clayton Romans, associate director with the U.S. Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). “This is the exact type of information we’re hoping to receive.” CISA was announcing Symantec’s inclusion into a joint public-private cybersecurity information sharing partnership, known as the JCDC, on Monday alongside the new research paper. The JCDC, or Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative, is a collective of government defense agencies, including the FBI and National Security Agency, and 22 U.S. technology companies that share intelligence about active cyberattacks with one another. The Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. Chinese officials have previously said China is also a victim of hacking and opposes all forms of cyber attacks. Symantec’s attribution to China is based on instances where components of Daxin were combined with other known, Chinese-linked computer hacker infrastructure or cyberattacks, said Vikram Thakur, a technical director with Symantec. Symantec researchers said the discovery of Daxin was noteworthy because of the scale of the intrusions and the advanced nature of the tool. ""The most recent known attacks involving Daxin occurred in November 2021,"" the research report reads. ""Daxin’s capabilities suggest the attackers invested significant effort into developing communication techniques that can blend in unseen with normal network traffic."" Daxin’s victims included high-level, non-western government agencies in Asia and Africa, including Ministries of Justice, Thakur added. “Daxin can be controlled from anywhere in the world once a computer is actually infected,” said Thakur. “That’s what raises the bar from malware that we see coming out of groups operating from China.” Romans said he did know of affected organizations in the U.S., but there were infections all around the globe, which the U.S. government was helping to notify. “Clearly the actors have been successful in not only conducting campaigns but being able to keep their creation under wraps for well over a decade,” said Thakur.

3/1/2022,"Crippling Western sanctions have changed the ""reality"" of the Russian economy, the Kremlin said Monday. The Russian ruble crashed Monday and Russia's central bank nearly doubled its base interest rate. Western sanctions were ""heavy"" and ""problematic"" but could be countered, a Kremlin spokesperson said. The Kremlin said Monday that Russia's ""economic reality"" had ""considerably changed"" in the face of ""heavy"" and ""problematic"" Western sanctions. The admission came after Russia's ruble plunged 30% against the US dollar and the country's central bank more than doubled its base interest rate, to 20%. Russians were reportedly waiting in long lines to withdraw foreign currencies from ATMs. Western nations have united to impose sweeping sanctions on Russia after it attacked Ukraine, such as cutting off Russian banks from Swift, the international bank payment system; hindering the ability of Russia's central bank to deploy its foreign exchange reserves; and freezing assets linked to President Vladimir Putin. On Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Putin would meet with Russia's top central banking and finance officials, as well as the CEO of Sberbank, one of the country's leading lenders. An FT reporter described the planned meeting as ""an emergency meeting."" Peskov said Russia had ""the potential to offset the harm"" caused by the West's sanctions. However, per Reuters, he said: ""The economic reality has considerably changed. These are heavy sanctions, they are problematic."" He continued: ""Russia has been making plans for quite a long time for possible sanctions, including the most severe ones. There are response plans, they were developed and are being implemented as problems appear."" He added: ""We have had no reason to doubt the effectiveness and reliability of our central bank. There is no reason to doubt it now."" Peskov also said that Putin was ""quite indifferent"" about the sanctions leveled against him directly. ""The sanctions contain absurd claims about some assets,"" Peskov said. The European Central Bank said Monday that Sberbank's European operations ""are failing or likely to fail."" The ECB said that Sberbank's European operations ""experienced significant deposit outflows as a result of the reputational impact of geopolitical tensions. This led to a deterioration of its liquidity position. And there are no available measures with a realistic chance of restoring this position at group level and in each of its subsidiaries within the banking union.""

3/1/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp said it will suspend domestic factory operations on Tuesday, losing around 13,000 cars of output, after a supplier of plastic parts and electronic components was hit by a suspected cyber attack. No information was immediately available about who was behind the possible attack or the motive. The attack comes just after Japan joined Western allies in clamping down on Russia after it invaded Ukraine, although it was not clear if the attack was at all related. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said his government would investigate the incident and whether Russia was involved. ""It is difficult to say whether this has anything to do with Russia before making thorough checks,"" he told reporters. Kishida on Sunday announced that Japan would join the United States and other countries in blocking some Russian banks from accessing the SWIFT international payment system. He also said Japan would give Ukraine $100 million in emergency aid. A spokesperson at the supplier, Kojima Industries Corp, said it appeared to have been the victim of some kind of cyber attack. A spokesperson from Toyota described it as a ""supplier system failure."" The company does not yet know if the halt at its 14 plants in Japan, which account for about a third of its global production, will last more than a day, the spokesperson added. Some plants operated by Toyota's affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu are included in the shutdown. Toyota, which has experienced cyber attacks in the past, is a pioneer of Just-In-Time manufacturing with parts that arrive from suppliers going straight to the production line rather than being stockpiled. State actors have launched cyberattacks on Japanese corporations in the past, including an attack on Sony Corp in 2014, which exposed internal data and shut down computer systems. The United States blamed North Korea for that attack, which came after Sony released ""The Interview"", a comedy about a plot to assassinate the regime's leader Kim Jong Un. Toyota's production halt comes as the world's biggest automaker is already tackling supply chain disruptions around the world caused by the COVID pandemic, which has forced it and other carmakers to curb output. Toyota this month also saw some production stopped in North America due to parts shortages caused by the Canadian trucker protests.

3/1/2022,"STORY: BP took the headlines Monday (February 28), after it said it would abandon its stake in Russian oil firm Rosneft. That will cost the British giant around $25 billion. But the oil major is just one of many firms looking to quit Russia or halt operations there. Norwegian oil firm Equinor says it too will start divesting from its joint ventures in the country. British bank HSBC will wind down relations with a host of Russian banks including VTB, the country’s second largest. That’s according to a memo seen by Reuters. Russian airlines may also struggle to hold onto their planes. AerCap, the world’s biggest aircraft lessor, says it will terminate leases with carriers in the country. Over half of the 980 passenger jets in use in Russia are rented from foreign firms, according to analytics firm Cirium. AerCap’s clients include Aeroflot and other big carriers. Meanwhile, U.S.-based UPS and FedEX say they will halt activity in Russia and Ukraine. The move suspends inbound and outbound shipments. Now the withdrawals put mounting pressure on the firms that remain. BP’s move means tough questions for other oil firms including ExxonMobil and Shell.
