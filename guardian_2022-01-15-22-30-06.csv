1/15/2022,"The latest epic from Hanya Yanagihara, To Paradise stretches from 1893 to 2093 in imagined altered states of America. It also follows 2015’s ubiquitous A Little Life, which traumatised and entranced readers in equal measure. (It was 96 in the Guardian’s 100 best books of the 21st century.)  The cover of the US edition of A Little Life featured a photo of a man seemingly in despair or pain, but it’s actually titled Orgasmic Man and is taken from a 1960s series on the theme by photographer Peter Hujar, who chronicled the intrigues and explosions of life in downtown New York. Hujar, who died in 1987 from Aids-related pneumonia, is the subject of a recent book by Linda Rosenkrantz. On 18 December 1974, she asked Hujar to document everything that happened to him in one day – the pair then discussed it, recording their conversation. The results have been transcribed in Peter Hujar’s Day. Rosenkrantz is also a baby-naming industry pioneer: in 1988 she and Pamela Redmond Satran published naming guide Beyond Jennifer & Jason. Redmond Satran’s 2005 novel Younger, about a woman in her 40s who pretends to be more youthful to get an entry-level job in publishing, was turned into a TV series by Darren Star (Sex and the City, Emily in Paris et al), starring Sutton Foster, Hilary Duff and Miriam Shor. The latter had a role in Reagan-era spy drama The Americans, created by former CIA officer Joe Weisberg. Joe’s journalist brother, Jacob, is the co-founder of podcast company Pushkin Industries. Jacob’s wife is Deborah Needleman who, from 2012 to 2016, was editor of the New York Times’s T Magazine. As well as writing novels that rip your heart out, Yanagihara is a journalist; in 2017, she took over running T. Read Talk is Linda Rosencrantz’s 1968 “reality novel”, in which she taped and transcribed hours of conversations with friends, documenting more lives of 1960s New York bohemia. Eat The Instagram account @toparadisenovel has been trailing details of the book, including a recipe for “broiled raccoon with lovage and grits”.

1/15/2022,"As niches go, a work that combines a tribute to the great American choreographer Merce Cunningham with juggling is a particularly narrow one. Yet the odd thing about Life, which launched the London international mime festival last week, is just how universal and all-embracing it feels. I for one am not a fan of mime or circus. I have always admired the works of the Cunningham more than I have loved them. Yet this act of affection is surreally life-enhancing and joyful.  Its pivots are Gandini Juggling’s founders, Sean Gandini and Kati Ylä-Hokkala, who seem in love with the mathematical and philosophical purity of juggling, and Jennifer Goggans, a former Cunningham dancer who has learned to juggle. The resulting piece recreates excerpts from the choreographer’s works and his distinctive style, but with the twist that balls, hoops and clubs arc through the air to add their own parabolas, rises and geometric lines to his sharp jumps and angled limbs. Accompanied by Caroline Shaw’s music and Guy Hoare’s sublimely simple lighting, Life has a serene beauty, a geometric poetry, that satisfies the eye and dazzles the mind. To begin with, it is all rapid movements, and white balls shooting upwards in seemingly uncanny motion; later the dancers freeze into slo-mo groups, their intricate movements functioning like an elaborate machine. At one moment, Gandini stops the action with a randomness of which Cunningham would have been proud, to explain that they are about to recreate a particular piece. One performer demonstrates the original version; two men stand together to create a four-handed creature to elaborate on the theme. There’s a pure pleasure in the cleverness of all this; the performers are uniformly transfixing, their smiles utterly infectious. It feels like a very good way to start the year.

1/15/2022,"The actor Jamie Dornan has revealed he was stuck in hotel quarantine in Australia when he received the news that his father, Jim, had died from Covid after being hospitalised for a routine knee operation. Dornan, 39, most famous for Fifty Shades of Grey and crime drama television series The Fall, found himself on the other side of the world with four days of his quarantine remaining when his father died last March, and was unable to travel back to his native Northern Ireland.  Dornan was required to isolate in Australia ahead of filming BBC drama The Tourist, in which he plays a man who has no idea who he is and why he has been left stranded in Australia’s outback. Figures released by the BBC on Friday showed The Tourist is the third most successful drama launch on iPlayer, having been streamed more than 18m times. Losing his father made 2021 “the worst year …  and the hardest” of his life, Dornan told the Sun. “It’s been a brutal time for lots of reasons and for lots of people. We’re all just trying to ride it out and come out the other side – and hope we’ve got our heads intact,” he said. Dornan’s father, Jim, was a renowned obstetrician and gynaecologist at the Royal Victoria hospital in Belfast and is said to have been proud that his son is starring in Sir Kenneth Branagh’s Oscar-tipped eponymous film set there, alongside Dame Judi Dench. The coming of age comedy-drama about a young boy and his working-class family getting caught up in Northern Ireland’s Troubles in the late 1960s received seven Golden Globe nominations and won in the Best Screenplay category. It will hit UK cinemas in late January. Dornan, who lives in rural Gloucestershire with his wife, Amelia Warner, 39, and their three young daughters, said that the plot of Belfast resonated with him on a personal level, and still calls himself a “Belfast man”, although he left the city aged 20. In the film, Dornan plays a father who has come to England to work in the hope his family can join him there and leave the tensions between Protestants and Catholics in Belfast behind. “[Belfast] is home. We probably feel like that’s a particular thing, a ‘Belfast man’, and I think we all know what that means,” Dornan said. “If you’re from Belfast, no matter what era you grew up in, you’ve been through something. “You’ve been through a certain hardship and you’ve been tested at many different stages of your life.” Jim supported his son’s pursuit of an acting career and helped him navigate the loss of his mother, Lorna, from pancreatic cancer when he was 16, telling his son: “Don’t let this be the thing that defines you.” “I’ve been subjected, early on in my life and now, to a lot of pain and loss,” Dornan said.",Arts/Culture,Jamie Dornan was stuck in Australian quarantine when dad died of Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/15/jamie-dornan-was-stuck-in-australian-quarantine-when-dad-died-of-covid
1/15/2022,"As one of the most unexpected recent breakout seasons came to an end in November, Emma Raducanu seemed to have built a solid base for the new year. After the grand slam success, the first round of new endorsements, the questions over her coaching choices and the predictable dip in form as her life changed for ever, Raducanu closed off her year by hiring an experienced, well-regarded coach, Torben Beltz, to guide her through her next steps of her young career. With the off-season beckoning, Raducanu frequently spoke about her goal of improving her physical strength and fitness in order to address the gap between herself and the chiselled, grown athletes she will now face every week. As she navigates so many first-time experiences under a glaring spotlight, a complicated second season was always on the cards but Raducanu had positioned herself well.  However, not everything can be accounted for. In the middle of December, Raducanu tested positive for Covid-19 before she was due to compete in an exhibition in Abu Dhabi. While she was one of a number of players to contract Covid then, her recovery has seemingly taken the longest. Rafael Nadal won a title in Melbourne a few weeks later, Denis Shapovalov was back in action shortly afterwards. Raducanu, meanwhile, says it took 20 days until she began training at a decent intensity and she is still pacing herself back to full fitness. “It’s a challenge to try and find the balance of wanting to get out there and practice so much straight after coming out of isolation, but if you ever do it with the hours after not doing anything for 20 days, you always start picking up small niggles,” she said during the Australian Open media day on Saturday. “I’m just trying to find that balance.” Thus, Raducanu arrives at her Australian Open debut in far from ideal circumstances. Last week she competed for the first time in the new season and was hit clean off the court by the immensely talented Elena Rybakina in Sydney, losing 6-0, 6-1 in less than an hour. “The first week I wasn’t able to practise so much,” she said. “But after Sydney, the match, it was just good to see where I was at that point in time.” This coming week will mark another new experience for Raducanu. The only other time she has competed in Australia was as a 16-year-old junior in 2019 and she lost in the first round of the junior Australian Open. In her senior debut this year, she will contest a headline match against Sloane Stephens in a battle of two US Open champions. At 14, Raducanu was watching as Stephens won her title in 2017 and the pair have hit together in the past. If the various posters of Raducanu across the grounds are any indication of her favour with the organisers, they will do battle on one of the stadium courts. The path that Stephens has taken in her career underlines how little guarantee there is of sustained success after one grand slam title. Stephens is one of the talents of her generation, blessed with supreme athleticism, one of the heaviest forehands in the sport and a relatively complete game, and she is still capable of achieving even more. But her time at the top of the game so far, although brilliant, was fleeting. She is now ranked 68th and, although there have been recent glimpses of promise, Stephens remains extremely inconsistent. She is just as capable of rising to the moment and picking off any opponent in the world as she is of throwing in a lethargic, uninspired performance to nobody at all. Chris Evert has revealed that she has been diagnosed with stage one ovarian cancer and she began cancer treatment, including chemotherapy, in December. Evert is one of the greatest tennis players of all time, having won 18 grand slam titles while her popularity helped to transform the women’s game. “I’ve lived a very charmed life,” she told ESPN. “Now I have some challenges ahead of me. But, I have comfort in knowing the chemotherapy is to ensure that cancer does not come back.” Tumaini Carayol After indicating that she remains a fair distance from the height of her physical abilities, Raducanu says she is approaching this match calmly and feels no pressure on her shoulders for the coming week. “I feel like I’m just happy to be here and have a swing,” she said. “I had to jump a few hurdles to play here, so I’m very – just want to go out there and have fun and enjoy on the court.” This is the beginning of a new season for Raducanu, one that will reveal plenty about her game and character, but also one that will require patience as she learns the ropes of professional tennis under pressure. It will be instructive to see if, when and how she finds her feet. In the meantime, patience will be an essential quality, which she says she is still working on. “I’m a bit of a perfectionist,” she says. “Whether that’s practice, whether that’s off the court, I want to be the best I can all the time. Sometimes it’s just not very viable. I think that’s one thing, I need to just relax. As long as the trend is trending upwards, just a matter of small fluctuations, I think I can be proud.” In the build up to the Australian Open, Nike released a typically slick commercial featuring Raducanu. As she stood from the baseline and attacked balls, words flashed behind her: “distracted”, “fluke”, “one-hit wonder”. In a few fleeting months, and with only four tournaments played, the discourse surrounding Raducanu has notably soured. One of the keys to success will be in the ethos of that video; blocking out noise, focusing on herself and understanding that consistent work will yield success even if it takes some time. Asked about her opinion on the subject on Saturday, Raducanu smiled. “I think the video speaks for itself,” she said. “Yeah, that’s how I feel. That’s it, full stop.”",Sport/Sport,Emma Raducanu well placed to move forward under glaring spotlight | Tumaini Carayol,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/15/emma-raducanu-well-placed-move-forward-under-glaring-spotlight-wta-tennis
1/15/2022,"Composers dream of a big commission from a world-class chorus and orchestra. With the delight comes terror: infinite choices, decisions, expectations. Will the work say anything new? Will the quixotic array of options be used to most expressive effect? The British composer Julian Anderson (b.1967) has had more than a few such opportunities. His latest, Exiles, direct, atmospheric, powerful, was commissioned by an elite trio: the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, Boston Symphony Orchestra and Bayerischer Rundfunk. For a work in part about the enforced “exile” of Covid, it has been tripped up rudely, like much else, by the pandemic itself. Two of its projected five movements were premiered by the LSO and Simon Rattle last September, with a third, for unaccompanied double chorus, added last week, the soprano Siobhan Stagg a gleaming soloist. Anderson seemingly carries an entire solar system of orchestral sound in his head. (He’s the one you want on your team in a music quiz – having once sat gratefully by while he hoovered up every point – capable of identifying music in a split second, like knowing a painter from a speck of pigment.) His compositions may fall generally within the conventions of the concert hall but his voice is intense and incisive, combining and dividing instruments to create fresh timbres and textures.  The new movement is a homage to the American diplomat Varian Fry, who saved thousands of Europeans threatened by Nazi invasion in 1940-41. Variously intoning their names freely, or singing Psalm 46 (“God is our hope and strength”), the London Symphony Chorus performed, hidden away, in the Barbican’s balcony, voices soaring in disembodied, many-layered splendour. Blame social distancing, but it worked. All five movements, with texts in French, Hebrew and English, will be performed (and broadcast live) in Munich on 21 January. The rest of the programme, by no means conventional and the better for it, included the Blumine movement from Mahler’s Symphony No 1. He ditched it; I’d be happy to as well. Yet Rattle and the LSO turned it into a thing of sensuous beauty, the saccharine, mawkish trumpet melody, now taut and lean, played superbly by the orchestra’s new principal trumpet, James Fountain. Like so many brass players, he has a brass band background, his sound pinging, pure and eloquent. The spirited and capacious third movement from the Symphony in E major (1878-80) by Hans Rott was the evening’s novelty. Rott was a friend of Mahler but loathed by Brahms and came to an early and unhappy end. The evening’s second half opened with Webern’s Six Pieces for Large Orchestra, a miniature treasure chest of perfect structure and variety. Dvořák’s Symphony No 7, with some small smudges but enormous drive, definition and rhythmic urgency, completed an enthusiastically received evening. Grange Park Opera has pulled many a trick out of its magic hat in response to the constraints of the past two years. Its latest effervescent offering is Puccini’s Gianni Schicchi (1917-18), an ideal choice for GPO’s sixth filmed opera. Part of his triple bill, Il trittico, this humane comedy is drawn from a tale of greed and trickery in Dante’s Inferno. In Giovacchino Forzano, Puccini had a versatile librettist, capable of providing the text for another Trittico opera, Suor Angelica, about a nun and her heartbreak over an illegitimate child. He was also, food for thought, later a director of fascist propaganda films for Mussolini. The cast of 12, led by William Dazeley in the title role, put glee and humour into every note and gesture. Chloe Morgan (who made the most of the opera’s big number, O mio babbino caro) and Luis Gomes were irrepressible as the young lovers. Merely being in one room with the likes of Ailish Tynan, Sara Fulgoni, Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts, Jeremy White and more must have felt like a party, never mind the joy of romping through Puccini’s wriggling, quicksilver score. According to past practice – in Owen Wingrave and L’heure espagnole – the company sweet-talked friendly patrons into lending their premises for the action, in this case a deluxe home and a garage workshop (Schicchi is updated from Florentine “new money” trickster to car mechanic). The sound was recorded at Wigmore Hall, with Chris Hopkins as music director and pianist. A small and nameless canine star nearly stole the show.
