4/7/2022,"The CEO of bedding company MyPillow, Mike Lindell, has been sued for defamation by a former employee of Dominion Voting Systems. Eric Coomer, the former employee of the voting machines company that became embroiled in Donald Trump’s false claims that he was denied victory at the 2020 election because of widespread voter fraud, has filed a court complaint against Lindell, Insider reported. The suit alleges that Lindell and his media platform Frankspeech, targeted Coomer as part of his “efforts to undermine faith in American democracy and enrich himself in the process”. Lindell, a Trump supporter, conservative activist and conspiracy theorist, was handed the lawsuit while at a political rally he hosted in Denver, Colorado. “What’s this?” Lindell said upon receiving the envelope. “It’s for you,” the messenger said. As Mike Lindell walks away from his “election integrity” speech on the steps of the CO Capitol today, he gets served with Eric Coomer’s (Dominion Security) defamation lawsuit. “What is this?” “It’s for you.” From @Marshall9News pic.twitter.com/F9Aq3qHdfl In the lawsuit, Coomer, Dominion’s former director of product strategy and security, said Lindell: “Has publicly accused [him] of being a ‘traitor to the United States’…[and] has claimed, without evidence, that Dr Coomer committed treason and that he should turn himself in to the authorities.” The complaint went on to accuse Lindell of publishing numerous false statements, defamatory interviews and other “dishonest content maligning Dr Coomer” on Frankspeech, often along with a sales pitch for MyPillow products. “Despite defendants’ baseless claims of election fraud being disproven by credible authorities across political parties, they persist in their campaign to profit from the ‘Big Lie’ [that Joe Biden didn’t win] by destroying the lives of private individuals like Dr Coomer,” the filing said. “They have not acknowledged the harm they have caused, nor have they retracted any of their false statements,” it added. According to the complaint, Coomer’s reputation has been “irreparably tarnished” and that he is no longer able to work in the election industry “on account of the unwarranted distrust inspired by defendants’ lies.” Instead, Coomer now receives frequent death threats and bears the “burden of being made the face of an imagined criminal conspiracy of unprecedented scope in American history”, the complaint said. In a statement to Insider in response to the lawsuit, Lindell pushed back against Coomer and said: “MyPillow and Frankspeech didn’t do nothing. I don’t even know if I’ve ever mentioned Eric Coomer… They’re trying to cancel Frankspeech, your favorite show!” Last year, Lindell appeared on Frankspeech, accusing Coomer by name of voter fraud and urging him to surrender himself to authorities.",News/US news,MyPillow CEO sued for defamation by former Dominion Voting employee,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/06/mypillow-ceo-mike-lindell-sued-defamation-former-dominion-employee
4/7/2022,"“Climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals, but the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels.” – United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres I’m a climate scientist and a desperate father. How can I plead any harder? What will it take? What can my colleagues and I do to stop this catastrophe unfolding now all around us with such excruciating clarity? On Wednesday, I risked arrest by locking myself to an entrance to the JP Morgan Chase building in downtown Los Angeles with colleagues and supporters. Our action in LA is part of an international campaign organized by a loosely knit group of concerned scientists called Scientist Rebellion, involving more than 1,200 scientists in 26 countries and supported by local climate groups. Our day of action follows the IPCC Working Group 3 report released Monday, which details the harrowing gap between where society is heading and where we need to go. Our movement is growing fast. We chose JP Morgan Chase because out of all the investment banks in the world, JP Morgan Chase funds the most new fossil fuel projects. As the new IPCC report explains, emissions from current and planned fossil energy infrastructure are already more than twice the amount that would push the planet over 1.5°C of global heating, a level of heating that will bring much more intense heat, fire, storms, flooding, and drought than the present 1.2°C. Even limiting heating to below 2°C, a level of heating that in my opinion could threaten civilization as we know it, would require emissions to peak before 2025. As UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in the press conference on Monday: “Investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure is moral and economic madness.” And yet, this is precisely what President Biden, most other world leaders, and major banks are doing. It’s no exaggeration to say that Chase and other banks are contributing to murder and neocide through their fossil fuel finance. Earth breakdown is much worse than most people realize. The science indicates that as fossil fuels continue to heat our planet, everything we love is at risk. For me, one of the most horrific aspects of all this is the juxtaposition of present-day and near-future climate disasters with the “business as usual” occurring all around me. It’s so surreal that I often find myself reviewing the science to make sure it’s really happening, a sort of scientific nightmare arm-pinch. Yes, it’s really happening. If everyone could see what I see coming, society would switch into climate emergency mode and end fossil fuels in just a few years. I hate being the Cassandra. I’d rather just be with my family and do science. But I feel morally compelled to sound the alarm. By the time I switched from astrophysics into Earth science in 2012, I’d realized that facts alone were not persuading world leaders to take action. So I explored other ways to create social change, all the while becoming increasingly concerned. I joined Citizens’ Climate Lobby. I reduced my own emissions by 90% and wrote a book about how this turned out to be satisfying, fun, and connecting. I gave up flying, started a website to help encourage others, and organized colleagues to pressure the American Geophysical Union to reduce academic flying. I helped organize FridaysForFuture in the US. I co-founded a popular climate app and started the first ad agency for the Earth. I spoke at climate rallies, city council meetings, and local libraries and churches. I wrote article after article, open letter after open letter. I gave hundreds of interviews, always with authenticity, solid facts, and an openness to showing vulnerability. I’ve encouraged and supported countless climate activists and young people behind the scenes. And this was all on my personal time and at no small risk to my scientific career. Nothing has worked. It’s now the eleventh hour and I feel terrified for my kids, and terrified for humanity. I feel deep grief over the loss of forests and corals and diminishing biodiversity. But I’ll keep fighting as hard as I can for this Earth, no matter how bad it gets, because it can always get worse. And it will continue to get worse until we end the fossil fuel industry and the exponential quest for ever more profit at the expense of everything else. There is no way to fool physics. Martin Luther King Jr said, “He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.” Out of necessity, and after exhaustive efforts, I’ve joined the ranks of those who selflessly risk their freedom and put their bodies on the line for the Earth, despite ridicule from the ignorant and punishment from a colonizing legal system designed to protect the planet-killing interests of the rich. It’s time we all join them. The feeling of solidarity is a wonderful balm. As for the climate scientists? We’ve been trying to tell you this whole time.

4/7/2022,"Rishi Sunak’s multi-millionaire wife claims non-domicile status, it has emerged, which allows her to save millions of pounds in tax on dividends collected from her family’s IT business empire. Akshata Murthy, who receives about £11.5m in annual dividends from her stake in the Indian IT services company Infosys, declares non-dom status, a scheme that allows people to avoid tax on foreign earnings. Murthy, the daughter of Infosys’s billionaire founder, owns a 0.93% stake in the tech firm worth approximately £690m. The company’s most recent accounts suggest that Murthy’s stake would have yielded her £11.6m in dividend payments in the last tax year. Under UK tax laws, Murthy’s status as a non-dom would mean she would not have had to pay tax on the dividend payment from overseas companies. Infosys is headquartered in Bengaluru, India, and listed on the Indian and New York stock exchange. By contrast, UK resident taxpayers pay a 38.1% tax on dividend payouts. A spokeswoman for Murthy said: “Akshata Murthy is a citizen of India, the country of her birth and parents’ home. India does not allow its citizens to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously. So, according to British law, Ms Murthy is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes. She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income.” The Treasury declined to comment. It comes a day after it was revealed that Sunak and Murthy donated more than £100,000 to the chancellor’s old private school, Winchester College. It is understood that Sunak, the chancellor, declared his wife’s tax status to the Cabinet Office when he became a minister in 2018, and he had also made the Treasury “aware, so as to manage any potential conflicts”. Tulip Siddiq, Labour’s economic secretary to the treasury, said: “The chancellor has imposed tax hike after tax hike on the British people. It is staggering that – at the same time – his family may have been benefiting from tax reduction schemes. This is yet another example of the Tories thinking it is one rule for them, another for everyone else. “Rishi Sunak must now urgently explain how much he and his family have saved on their own tax bill at the same time he was putting taxes up for millions of working families and choosing to leave them £2,620 a year worse off.” Under current law, Murthy will automatically be deemed domiciled after living in the UK for 15 years. Murthy, who married Sunak in 2009, soon after they met while studying for a masters in business administration at Stanford University in Silicon Valley, moved to the UK in 2015. The non-domicile status, first introduced under King George III in 1799, is legal and can be used to avoid paying UK tax on income from overseas rents and bank interest as well as foreign dividends. Non-doms can live in the UK all year round. The revelation of Murthy’s tax status comes as Sunak’s popularity with voters plunges over his handling of the cost of living crisis. Sunak’s net favourability is down 24 points since just before his spring statement on 23 March, to minus 29, according to a YouGov survey. It is the lowest ever favourability polling for the chancellor, and puts his support below that of Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer (minus 25) for the first time since he took office. In his Spring Statement last month, Sunak raised the tax burden on UK taxpayers to its highest level since the 1940s, even as the population faces the biggest squeeze on living standards on record. The Resolution Foundation thinktank suggested Sunak’s package of measures would push 1.3 million people, including 500,000 children, into poverty. Murthy had previously faced accusations that she was collecting “blood money” dividends from Infosys’s continued operation in Russia despite the invasion of Ukraine. Following mounting pressure, the company last week announced that it was “urgently” closing its office in Russia. Sunak, who has repeatedly called on British companies to pull out of Russia in order to “inflict maximum economic pain” on Putin’s regime, had refused to comment on his wife’s 0.93% stake in Infosys. Murthy, whose family business is estimated to be worth around £3.5bn, has used the valuable tax status as recently as April 2020 – two months after her husband was put in charge of setting taxes for the country, according to two people familiar with her financial arrangements.",News/Politics,Rishi Sunak’s wife claims non-domicile status,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/06/rishi-sunaks-wife-claims-non-domicile-status
4/7/2022,"The Russian billionaire Moshe Kantor, who was sanctioned by the UK government on Wednesday, has long cultivated deep ties with British politicians and establishment figures, including Tony Blair and Prince Charles. With an estimated net worth of £3.48bn, Kantor is the largest shareholder in the fertiliser company Acron, which the Foreign Office said had vital strategic significance for the Russian government. But in Europe Kantor is best known as the holder of one of the Jewish community’s most high-profile roles, president of the European Jewish Congress (EJC), as well as his multitude of interests in Jewish charities, education and events. Born in Moscow and now a British citizen, Kantor, 68, has maintained close ties to Vladimir Putin, and has brought a number of delegations to meet the Russian president, according to Haaretz. In 2017, Putin bestowed Kantor with the Order of Honour “in recognition of his professional achievements and longstanding fair work”. The Kantor Centre, which the billionaire founded in Israel, has condemned Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. In 2015, Kantor appointed Tony Blair to a role tackling antisemitism as chairman of the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation, an organisation funded and founded by Kantor. Blair is still listed as a chair of the organisation, along with the former Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz. Kantor is vice president of the Jewish Leadership Council and honorary life president of a school in Ilford, east London, Kantor King Solomon, jointly with The Apprentice tycoon Lord Alan Sugar. He also organised the World Holocaust Forum, which marked the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp, attended in Jerusalem by Prince Charles, Macron, then US vice-president Mike Pence and Putin. The Kantor Centre, which he founded at Tel Aviv University, issued a statement condemning the war in Ukraine as an “unprovoked invasion … and the cowardly war crimes committed under the directives of Vladimir Putin”. It said the Russian invasion was “fascist-style aggression” and added: “Putin has the blood of thousands of victims, including children, on his hands. His policies pose an existential threat to world democracy, peace and security.” The EJC said it was “deeply shocked and appalled by the decision” to impose sanctions on Kantor, adding: “Dr Kantor has been granted the most prestigious awards and honours from many European heads of state and government. We call for this decision to be reversed as soon as possible.” Other oligarchs sanctioned by the UK on Wednesday were: Andrey Guryev, the main shareholder in PhosAgro, one of the world’s biggest fertiliser companies, with shares that traded on the London Stock Exchange until they were suspended following the invasion. He was revealed in 2015 to be the beneficiary of an offshore company that owned the 25-bedroom Witanhurst mansion beside London’s Hampstead Heath, the UK’s second largest private residence after Buckingham Palace. Leonid Mikhelson, the founder of Russian natural gas producer Novatek, which also listed its shares in London before the invasion. Mikhelson has an estimated net worth of $22bn (£17bn), according to Forbes, and his business partner is the sanctioned oligarch Gennady Timchenko. Mikhelson, an avid art collector, founded a not-for-profit Russian contemporary art foundation, V-A-C, in 2009, which has since funded international collaborations, including in London. Boris Rotenberg, son of the co-owner of Russia’s largest gas pipeline producer, SGM, joins his billionaire father and uncle on the sanctions list. He lives in London’s Belgravia, according to the UK and US governments. Sergey Kogogin is the director of Kamaz, a manufacturer of trucks and buses, including for the Russian military. Andrey Akimov is the CEO of Russia’s third largest bank, Gazprombank, who was sanctioned by the US in 2018 amid anger over apparent Russian interference in the US 2016 election. Sergey Sergeyevich Ivanov is the son of one of Putin’s closest associates, Sergei Ivanov, a former KGB agent who became deputy prime minister and defence minister. He is president of the world’s largest diamond producer, Alrosa, which the UK also sanctioned on Wednesday. Alrosa produces almost a third of the world’s rough diamonds. Aleksander Dyukov is the chief executive of Gazprom Neft, Russia’s third largest and majority state-owned oil producer. A shipbuilding engineer by training, he worked at St Petersburg’s oil terminal shortly after Putin’s stint as deputy mayor, and has served on the board of petrochemicals company Sibur alongside other Putin allies.",News/World news,Moshe Kantor: UK sanctions Russian billionaire over ties to Putin,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/moshe-kantor-uk-sanctions-russian-billionaire-over-ties-to-putin
