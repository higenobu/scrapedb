4/1/2022,"India’s external affairs minister, Dr S Jaishankar, has defended his country’s right to buy discounted oil from Russia following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, despite an appeal from the from his UK counterpart, Liz Truss, for democracies to show solidarity against authoritarians. He also contrasted the concern the west has shown about the invasion with what he described as the relative uninterest in the Taliban takever of Afghanistan, saying people seemed motivated by the proximity of a crisis, as much as anything. Truss, on a visit to India, repeatedly said she was not seeking to lecture the Indians, or anyone, on how to respond to the Russian invasion, but cast the conflict as authoritarians versus democracy, a framing that should mean India should be more fully engaged as the world’s largest democracy. Jaishankar complained there seemed to be a campaign to distort India’s attitude to discounted Russian oil. “I was just reading a report today, that in the month of March, Europe has bought, I think, 15% more oil and gas from Russia, than the month before. If you look at the major buyers of oil and gas from Russia, I think you’ll find most of them are in Europe,” he said. “When oil prices go up. I think it’s natural for countries to go out and look for what are good deals for that thing.” Refiners in India, the world’s third biggest oil importer and consumer, have been buying Russian oil through spot tenders since Moscow’s invasion on 24 February, taking advantage of heavy discounts as other buyers back away. India has purchased at least 13m barrels of Russian oil since 24 February, compared with nearly 16m barrels in all of 2021. There have been reports of private warnings by the US to India not to take advantage of a visit to India by the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, to strike new deals that in effect endorsed or enabled Russia’s invasion. Truss, sitting next to Jaishankar at a policy exchange economic forum in New Delhi, did not name India, but warned oil and gas revenues were funding Vladimir Putin’s war machine. “It’s vitally important for freedom and democracy in Europe, that we challenge Putin, and we ensure that he loses in Ukraine,” she said. “But we also think need to think more widely about the message it would send across the globe. If Putin was successful, if he was able to have success invading a sovereign nation, what message does that send to other aggressors around the world? And I think it’s very significant in the sanctions that have been applied on Russia, along with the weapons that are being supplied to Ukraine in their fight for freedom, is we are seeing an alliance with the G7, including Japan.” She added: “We’re also seeing countries like Australia, South Korea, Singapore, participate in those sanctions, because I think countries across the world, regardless of their specific size, status or structure, understand there is a fundamental problem if an aggressor can get away with invading a sovereign nation, and that does violate international law and violates the UN charter.” Jaishankar argued the west had to recognise that power was being diffused around the world. He spoke of an enormous economic rebalancing, which has taken place over the last 30 to 40 years, which has translated into a much more multipolar world, leading to the replacement of the centrality of the G7 with that of the G20. “So there’s a much broader spread of countries who have views and influence on how the world should be run,” he said. Truss declined to call out China on Ukraine, saying: “It is clear that it respects Ukraine sovereignty. And that is an important principle that as a member of the permanent five on the security council, and a responsible nation, China needs to stick to, and therefore we shouldn’t see China supporting Russia.”",News/World news,India defends buying discounted Russian oil despite appeal by Truss,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/india-defends-buying-discounted-russian-oil-despite-appeal-by-truss
4/1/2022,"Tuesday 28 November 2017 Paulette Wilson, who has lived in the UK for more than half a century, speaks to the Guardian about her treatment at the hands of the Home Office. The government had threatened to send her to Jamaica – a country she has not seen since she left it at the age of 10. Friday 1 December 2017 Anthony Bryan becomes the second of the Windrush generation facing deportation under Theresa May’s hostile environment policy to tell his story to the Guardian. Bryan’s deportation to Jamaica was only cancelled at the last moment after a legal intervention. “They don’t tell you why they are holding you and they don’t tell you why they let you out. You feel so depressed,” he said. Thursday 11 January 2018 The government relents in Wilson’s case, finally giving her official leave to remain in the UK. During her more than 50 years in the UK, Wilson had served food to MPs as a cook in the House of Commons and raised a family. But the Home Office did not initially believe she was in the country legally. Wednesday 21 February 2018 “It’s an appalling place to live. I’m a proud man; I’m embarrassed at my age to be living like this,” Renford McIntyre tells the Guardian as the former NHS driver, who arrived in the UK in 1968, details how he has been left homeless, living in an industrial unit after being told he was not allowed to work and was not eligible for any government support. Thursday 22 February 2018 The issue begins to snowball, as senior Caribbean diplomats urge the Home Office to adopt a “more compassionate” approach towards retirement-age Commonwealth citizens. “In this system one is guilty before proven innocent rather than the other way around,” the Jamaican high commissioner to London, Seth George Ramocan, says. Saturday 10 March 2018 There is widespread outrage as it emerges a man who has lived in London for 44 years is told to produce a British passport or face a bill of £54,000 for cancer treatment – forcing him to go without. Official suspicion about his immigration status also led to Albert Thompson – not his real name – being evicted and spending three weeks homeless. Thursday 22 March 2018 May refuses to intervene in Thompson’s case, having promised to do so when confronted by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, at prime minister’s questions. She says the decision lies with the hospital under her government’s new rules, which place a responsibility on clinicians to decide whether or not a case is urgent and demand documents before giving treatment where they are thought not to be. Monday 26 March – Monday 9 April 2018 Three more similar cases emerge: those of Sarah O’Connor; Elwaldo Romeo and Michael Braithwaite, who have each lived in the UK for more than 50 years. O’Connor was challenged to prove she was in the country legally by the benefits agency and Romeo received a letter from the Home Office saying he was “liable to be detained” because he was a “person without leave”. Braithwaite, an experienced special needs teaching assistant, lost his job after his employers ruled he was in the country illegally. Thursday 12 April 2018 International anger at Britain’s treatment of the Windrush generation grows as Caribbean diplomats condemn the Home Office. “I am dismayed that people who gave their all to Britain could be seemingly discarded so matter-of-factly,” says Guy Hewitt, the Barbados high commissioner to the UK. Friday 13 April 2018 Voices of opposition are also raised domestically, as four Church of England bishops join a call for an immigration amnesty for those people who moved to the UK from the Caribbean decades ago. They start a petition that is backed by more than 140,000 signatories by Monday. Sunday 15 April 2018 Downing Street refuses a formal diplomatic request to discuss the issue at this week’s meeting of the Commonwealth heads of government, leaving Caribbean diplomats with the impression the UK is not taking it seriously. Monday 16 April 2018 Events begin to move quickly. The Labour MP, David Lammy, calls this a “day of national shame”, telling the Commons: “Let us call it as it is. If you lay down with dogs, you get fleas, and that is what has happened with this far right rhetoric in this country.” The home secretary, Amber Rudd, announces the creation of a team dedicated to ensuring no more Windrush-era citizens be classified as illegal immigrants and acknowledges Home Office failings. She also promises none of them will be deported because of lack of paperwork. More than 140 MPs from all parties sign a letter to the prime minister, demanding she find a “swift resolution of this growing crisis”. The same day, it emerges that a man who moved from Jamaica in 1955 has spent the last seven years fighting the Home Office over his immigration status. Richard Stewart cannot afford the £1,400 fee to naturalise in the UK. Tuesday 17 April 2018 A former Home Office employee tells The Guardian that the department destroyed thousands of landing card slips in 2010 which recorded Windrush immigrants’ arrival dates in the UK. The anonymous whistleblower says the records were destroyed when the Home Office’s Whitgift Centre in Croydon was closed and staff were moved to another site despite employees telling their managers it was a bad idea. May apologises to the 12 Caribbean heads of government during a meeting for the treatment of Windrush citizens and promised that no one would be deported. Wednesday 18 April 2018 May promises that Thompson, will get the care he requires. The prime minister tries to blame Labour for the decision to destroy the landing card slips, but it emerges that one of the decisions to do so took place in 2010 when she was home secretary. Friday 20 April 2018 May tells Commonwealth leaders that members of the Windrush generation who had suffered “anxieties and problems” as a result of the government’s immigration rules would receive compensation. Monday 23 April 2018 Rudd pledges that the Windrush generation will be granted British citizenship and the Home Office will waive citizenship fees for those affected and their families, as well as any charges for returning to the UK for those who had retired to their countries of origin. It will also scrap language and British knowledge tests for the Caribbean immigrants involved. Wednesday 25 April 2018 Rudd gives evidence to the home affairs committee and says she “deeply regrets” not spotting the Windrush scandal. She rejects claims the Home Office had targets for the removal of immigrants in the country illegally. But her claim is contradicted by Lucy Moreton, the general secretary of the ISU, the union for immigration service workers. Thursday 26 April 2018 Rudd is brought in front of the Commons after a document shows officials did have targets for departures. She admits the targets existed, but says they were local and she did not approve them. After her Commons statement, she announces that the targets will be ditched. Friday 27 April 2018 A memo emerges that was sent to Rudd giving details of targets, apparently contradicting her earlier claims. When she finally responds to the revelation, she says on Twitter that she had not seen the leaked memo, “although it was copied to my office, as many documents are”. She repeats her claim that she “wasn’t aware of specific removal targets”, adding: “I accept I should have been and I’m sorry that I wasn’t.” Sunday 29 April 2018 Leaked letters published in the Guardian reveal that in a 2017 letter to May, Rudd had told the prime minister of her intention to increase deportations by 10%. This appears at odds with her claims she was not aware of deportation targets. Monday 30 April 2018 Rudd resigns as home secretary and admits she “inadvertently misled” MPs over targets for removing immigrants in the country illegally. In her resignation letter, Rudd says she takes “full responsibility” for the fact she was not aware of “information provided to [her] office which makes mention of targets”. Wednesday 3 April 2019 The new home secretary, Sajid Javid, announces a compensation scheme for the Windrush victims. No cap is place on the fund, making it impossible to estimate how much money will eventually be paid out. Announcing the scheme, Javid says: “Nothing we say or do will ever wipe away the hurt, the trauma, the loss that should never have been suffered by the men and women of the Windrush generation, but together we can begin to right the wrongs of Windrush.” Thursday 19 March 2020 An independent inquiry into the scandal concludes that the Home Office demonstrated “institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race”. The report, chaired by Wendy Williams, an inspector of constabulary, has 30 recommendations for the Home Office and prompts an official apology to the victims by the new home secretary, Priti Patel. Thursday 24 July 2020 Paulette Wilson, a prominent Windrush campaigner who was wrongly detained and threatened with deportation, dies unexpectedly at the age of 64. Her death came just over a month after she and five other survivors of the scandal delivered a petition to Downing Street calling on the government to speed up compensation payments and introduce all of Williams’ recommendations. Four days after the petition was delivered Patel agreed to Wilson’s demands. Wednesday 18 November 2020 The Guardian reveals that complaints of racism and discrimination within Home Office teams set up to address the Windrush scandal have prompted the launch of an internal investigation. Alexandra Ankrah, the most senior black Home Office employee in the team responsible for the Windrush compensation scheme had resigned in protest, describing the the scheme as systemically racist and unfit for purpose. Wednesday 19 May 2021 The Home Office reveals that 21 people have died while waiting for Windrush compensation claims to be paid. The admission reinforces concerns that the scheme is taking too long to make payments to older people affected by the scandal. Wednesday 24 November 2021 The home affairs committee finds that only 5% of Windrush victims have received compensation four years after the scandal emerged. The committee’s damning report is the fourth in six months to criticise the speed of compensation, following similar frustrations expressed by the legal charity Justice, the National Audit Office and the public accounts committee. Thursday 31 March 2022 An inspection report finds the Home Office has failed to transform its culture or to become a more compassionate department, as it promised to do after the Windrush scandal. The independent expert, Wendy Williams, who was appointed to advise the Home Office on how to make changes to avoid any future crisis, says she is “disappointed by the lack of tangible progress or drive to achieve the cultural changes required”.",News/UK news,Windrush-era citizens row: timeline of key events,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/16/windrush-era-citizens-row-timeline-of-key-events
4/1/2022,"Public sector unions have reacted with fury after ministers announced that pay increases across the civil service would be pegged at an average of 2% for the year ahead, despite surging inflation. In a written statement published on Thursday, Cabinet Office minister Heather Wheeler said public sector employers would “have freedom to pay average awards up to 2%”, plus up to an extra 1% in some cases, to be “targeted at specific priorities in their workforce and pay strategies”. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, lifted a freeze on public sector pay last autumn; but the fresh limit for civil servants suggests the Treasury remains reluctant to loosen the purse strings. By contrast, the latest official figures showed that average pay across the economy is increasing at an annual rate of 4.8%. Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, said the offer was effectively a pay cut because of rising inflation and said industrial action could follow. “The failure of the government to recognise the cost-of-living crisis is a disgrace and shows utter contempt to our members, who have worked themselves to the bone during the pandemic … PCS will now be discussing an industrial response to this outrage.” Garry Graham, the deputy general secretary of the Prospect union, said:“With inflation rocketing, a national insurance increase coming in and energy prices going through the roof this 2-3% pay remit guidance means yet another crippling real-terms pay cut for civil servants. “Once again the government is using civil service pay as a political football and attempting to balance the books by penalising the people who have delivered so much through the twin challenges of Brexit and Covid.” Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, the union for senior civil servants, said: “The government has decided to abandon its own workforce and make no attempt to soften the blow to civil servants, who have spent the last two years helping the country through the health and economic emergencies. Ministers are running around with their fingers in their ears trying to pretend it’s business as usual.” Sunak was widely criticised after last week’s spring statement, for failing to do more to help protect workers against rocketing inflation, which is forecast to peak at 8%. He told the BBC on Thursday that he didn’t mind being unpopular, because he was doing the right thing for the economy. “The toughest part of this job is not being able to do everything that people would like you to do because we’re already borrowing quite a large amount of money, and I don’t think borrowing lots more would be sensible. Actually, it has the risk of making the problem worse when you’ve got inflation and interest rates going up,” he said.“Some of these things are difficult. They’re certainly unpopular. But they’re responsible and will help us in the long term and I’m not going to deviate from that just for some short-term popularity gain,” he said. The civil service pay guidance covers Whitehall departments, as well as agencies and arms-length government bodies. The director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, Paul Johnson, suggested that with civil service pay already having suffered a decade of real-terms pay cuts, the government was, “testing the limits of employee patience and of the labour market”. The lowest-paid civil servants will benefit from the increase in the national living wage, which is going up by 6.6% to £9.50 per hour from 1 April. Meanwhile, analysis from the Health Foundation showed that soaring inflation meant that NHS staff suffered an average pay cut of £845 during 2021-22 and will see their income shrink by even more in 2022-23. Staff lost at least £845 on average, although for some this was as much as £1,690, because their 3% pay rise was outstripped by inflation as measured by the consumer prices index, which hit 5.5% in February. They were awarded the 3% last summer when inflation stood at 1.6%. They are facing an even bigger drop in real-terms income in 2022-23 because, while ministers have offered them 3% again, the Bank of England has forecast inflation to rise to as much as 8% soon. “NHS staff are already consumed by money worries when they’re at work giving vital care. These figures show why,” said Sara Gorton, head of health at the union Unison. “Health workers need a wage rise that helps them absorb the eye-watering bill increases ahead. Otherwise they’ll leave for better-paid work, which will be a disaster for patients.” Patricia Marquis, the Royal College of Nursing’s director for England, said: “This analysis is staggering and will give our members even greater worries about meeting the rising cost of living. “The expert analysts are telling government this is likely to lead to NHS staff losses and we know thousands of nursing staff are feeling close to quitting. It is patients who pay the price for the government’s shortsightedness.”",News/Politics,Fury after civil service pay rises capped at 3% amid surging inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/31/fury-after-civil-service-pay-rises-capped-at-3-amid-surging-inflation
4/1/2022,"A two-week battle to hold P&O Ferries to account for the summary sacking of 786 crew members appears to have ended with a whimper, as unions said the Dubai-owned company had “got away with it” after ministers backtracked on legal action and all but one employee accepted the firm’s controversial payoff ahead of Thursday’s deadline. All of P&O Ferries’ crew working on British contracts issued out of Jersey were fired on 17 March, to be replaced by cheap agency workers. The firm gave the sacked workers a deadline of 5pm on Thursday to accept or forfeit a payoff which they said compensated for the breach of their employment rights. The firm said by early Thursday afternoon all but one crew member, who could not be identified, had joined their redundancy process. The offer included a gagging clause prohibiting sacked crew from discussing P&O or taking further legal action. The promised payouts are understood to be higher than staff could have won had they sued at industrial tribunal. While the government unveiled proposals to tighten up maritime employment law this week, including legislation to make all ferries serving UK ports pay minimum wage, there was growing disillusionment over potential enforcement action. A spokesperson for the Nautilus union, which represented around a third of the sacked crew, said: “P&O has gotten away with it. There’s no fine, there’s no legal action, there’s only words and hot air.” They added: “What we’re really after now is systemic change so this can never happen again.” Ministers have ignored calls from MPs to use other sanctions, such as excluding P&O Ferries owner DP World from the running of new freeports in the UK. The Dubai-based group stands to benefit from around £50m of tax breaks by playing a leading role in establishing two freeports at London Gateway and Southampton. Labour has also demanded answers from the Foreign Office over a $720m (£548m) investment in DP World ports in Africa, using development aid money. Shadow minister Preet Kaur Gill wrote to Liz Truss to raise Labour’s concerns about using “taxpayers’ money to subsidise the business of a company that has treated British workers with such contempt”. The RMT union vowed to continue the fight but a spokesperson said sacked P&O Ferries members “had a gun to their head” as the Thursday deadline passed, as they could lose all redundancy pay. Ministers had encouraged individual employees to take the firm to a tribunal, but the government has backed away from its own pledges of legal action after P&O chief executive, Peter Hebblethwaite, admitted deliberately flouting employment law. Last week Boris Johnson told parliament: “We will take them to court, we will defend the rights of British workers … P&O plainly aren’t going to get away with it.” However, on Wednesday, the transport secretary admitted: “The government are not in a position to take court action.” Grant Shapps said he had asked the Insolvency Service to consider disqualifying Hebblethwaite for breaking the law but added: “It is, of course, for the Insolvency Service to decide what happens next.” The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, had originally warned P&O that it could face an unlimited fine, after asking the Insolvency Service to investigate. A government spokesperson said on Thursday: “No decision has been taken yet but we will not hesitate to take further action if we find evidence of wrongdoing.” Labour said the government’s stance was “bewildering”. The shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said P&O escaping without consequences would “give the green light to bad bosses across the country”. Haigh added: “The government must throw the book at P&O Ferries. Their reluctance to use every tool at their disposal force to hold P&O Ferries to account is bewildering. “Ministers must ensure the chief executive and those responsible are kicked out for their unlawful action, and explain why the legal action they promised to workers is not being taken.” Mick Lynch, the general secretary of the RMT, said: “They have said they will take legal action against P&O and we’re holding them to it. Why do they think they are still fit and proper to have a public role in freeports or anything else? We think they should be sanctioned in the same way as Russian oligarchs have been sanctioned.” While unions and many MPs remained supportive of the government’s proposals to address low pay in the sector, a long-neglected issue, there was growing disillusion as a crucial plank of Shapps’ plan was described as unworkable. The transport secretary told parliament that the government would write to the operators of British ports telling them to refuse access to companies that did not pay the UK minimum rate. However, the British Ports Association immediately warned that expecting port authorities to enforce such rules “could be unworkable” and would “place ports in a difficult legal predicament”. The chief executive of Major Ports Group, Tim Morris, told the BBC Today programme: “What’s being proposed here is quite different from normal good practice … a specific legal duty, a liability, to ensure that another business is complying with employment law. We are not police, we are not enforcement agencies of the law.” Sailings were not expected to restart on P&O Ferries passenger services out of Dover, Hull, Larne and Cairnryan for several days, with two vessels having failed inspections since the replacement crew boarded.",News/Business,P&O Ferries have ‘got away with it’ say unions as Shapps backtracks on action,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/31/p-and-o-ferries-unions-shapps-backtracks-action-sacking
4/1/2022,"More than two decades after the draft human genome was celebrated as a scientific milestone, scientists have finally finished the job. The first complete, gap-free sequence of a human genome has been published in an advance expected to pave the way for new insights into health and what makes our species unique. Dr Karen Miga, a scientist at the University of California, Santa Cruz who co-led the international consortium behind the project, said: “These parts of the human genome that we haven’t been able to study for 20-plus years are important to our understanding of how the genome works, genetic diseases, and human diversity and evolution.” Until now, about 8% of the human genome was missing, including large stretches of highly repetitive sequences, sometimes described as “junk DNA”. In reality though, these repeated sections were omitted due to technical difficulties in sequencing them, rather than pure lack of interest. Sequencing a genome is something like slicing up a book into snippets of text then trying to reconstruct the book by piecing them together again. Stretches of text that contain a lot of common or repeated words and phrases would be harder to put in their correct place than more unique pieces of text. New “long-read” sequencing techniques that decode big chunks of DNA at once – enough to capture many repeats – helped overcome this hurdle. Scientists were able to simplify the puzzle further by using an unusual cell type that only contains DNA inherited from the father (most cells in the body contain two genomes – one from each parent). Together these two advances allowed them to decode the more than 3bn letters that comprise the human genome. “In the future, when someone has their genome sequenced, we will be able to identify all of the variants in their DNA and use that information to better guide their healthcare,” said Dr Adam Phillippy, of the National Human Genome Research Institute in Maryland and co-chair of the consortium. “Truly finishing the human genome sequence was like putting on a new pair of glasses. Now that we can clearly see everything, we are one step closer to understanding what it all means.” One area of interest is that the parts of the genome with many repeated stretches include those where most of human genetic variation is found. Variability within these regions may also provide crucial clues to how our human ancestors underwent rapid evolutionary changes that led to more complex cognition. The work is also likely to lead to a better understanding of enigmatic components of the genome known as centromeres. They are dense bundles of DNA that hold chromosomes together and play a role in cell division, but until now had been considered unmappable because they contain thousands of stretches of DNA sequences that repeat over and over. The science behind the sequencing effort and some initial analysis of the new genome regions are outlined in six papers published in the journal Science. “Opening up these new parts of the genome, we think there will be genetic variation contributing to many different traits and disease risk,” said Rajiv McCoy, of Johns Hopkins University and a participant in the Telomere to Telomere (T2T) consortium. “There’s an aspect of this that’s like, we don’t know yet what we don’t know.”",News/Science,First complete gap-free human genome sequence published,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/31/first-complete-gap-free-human-genome-sequence-published
4/1/2022,"More than 1,200 people in the UK died while homeless in 2021, a 32% increase on the previous year, as cuts to mental illness, drug and alcohol, and housing services took their toll, according to research. The annual audit by the charity Museum of Homelessness, found most deaths occurred among people living in emergency housing or hostels. People sleeping rough or sofa surfing accounted for 63 deaths, and seven fatalities were due to Covid-19. Of the 253 cases where the cause of death was confirmed, 41% were related to drug and alcohol use, and 12% to suicide, which the charity said reflected the general inadequacy of mental health and addiction services provision. “It’s heart-breaking to see so many people dying and to feel so helpless in the face of such a serious emergency. Government neglect means things keep getting worse with new provision for mental health, addiction and social housing failing to make up for previous cuts,” said Jess Turtle, a co-founder of Museum of Homelessness. She added: “There needs to be a confidential inquiry into the deaths of homeless people to allow an honest appraisal of what’s happening to the UK’s most vulnerable people. There should also be mandatory fatality reviews for all local authorities – so lessons can be learned from each death.” The charity warned that the cost of living crisis, increasing evictions and overstretched housing and homelessness budgets were likely to put the lives of many more homeless people at risk in the coming months. Of the 12 local authority areas which had recorded the highest numbers of deaths in 2020, 11 recorded a rise last year. Seven recorded triple digit percentage increases: Glasgow, Enfield, Bedford, Barnet, Southampton, Stoke and Tower Hamlets. A number of local authority areas recorded significant falls in the number of homeless deaths, showing “positive progress” according to Museum of Homelessness. They included Stirling, Manchester, Kingston upon Hull and Camden. The charity said its Dying Homeless project used information from coroners’ inquiries, media coverage, family testimony and more than 300 freedom of information (FoI) requests to verify the details of each case. Last year it verified 1,286 “real and actual” deaths across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland up from 976 in 2020, and 710 in 2020. This was likely to be an underestimate, it said, as not all authorities replied to FoI requests, including large councils such as Birmingham and Blackpool. There were 325 homeless deaths in Northern Ireland, the figures show, although the Northern Ireland Housing Executive cautioned that this reflected a radically different definition of homelessness, and included many people in secure housing who would not be defined as homeless in the three other UK countries. The latest official figures for homeless deaths, published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in December, estimated at least 688 people died while homeless in 2020, although this applied only to England and Wales. This was a slight fall on record numbers recorded in 2019, attributed to the “Everyone In” scheme, when 37,000 homeless people were provided with a hotel room during the early months of the pandemic. Statisticians said difficulties collecting death registration during lockdown meant it may be an underestimate. A government spokesperson said: “Every death on our streets is a tragedy. Our most recent statistics published by the ONS estimated that homeless deaths decreased by 12% in 2020 compared to the previous year. Even one death is one too many, which is why councils will receive £2bn over the next three years to support the homeless.”",News/Society,"1,200 died while homeless in UK in 2021",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/31/1200-died-while-homeless-in-uk-in-2021
4/1/2022,"Guess the year in which a City analyst wrote this introduction to a research note on British Airways’ parent company, IAG: “BA suffered yet another operational failure yesterday, this time larger than the spate of rumbling issues over the last year. As yet the cause is not known.” Congratulations if you answered 2017, the year of Bthe airline’s mega IT meltdown. RBC Capital Markets’ analysts judged it “increasingly questionable” to view the affair as a one-off, and they have been proved correct in spades. Subsequent failures have been smaller but the “rumbling issues” of half a decade ago are still rumbling. On Wednesday this week, BA cancelled 50 flights at Heathrow because of a “network connectivity issue”, and the same number on Thursday as it managed the knock-on effects. On the last weekend in February, the figure was 252 when a different “technical” problem was blamed. In total, there have been three IT failures in six weeks. While the percentage of affected passengers in that period is calculated to be only 2.5%, the figure won’t feel small to those affected. BA is lucky that P&O Ferries has a monopoly on “travel chaos” stories. Every incident brings forth gushing apologies from BA but never a prediction of when its systems will be robust – or sufficiently resilient to withstand all but extraordinary events. You won’t find anything of that description in IAG’s annual report for 2021. The IT highlighted in BA chief executive Sean Doyle’s two-page summary of how the airline is “building a brighter future” is a new app that allows passengers to order food and drink to their table in the lounges. Punters would surely prefer greater confidence that their plane will take off. Even luddites understand that upgrading multiple legacy IT systems is not simple, especially when you have to keep an international fleet aloft at the same time. What is harder to fathom is why BA and IAG didn’t throw the kitchen sink at deep-rooted problems a decade ago. Short-termism? Complacency? An arrogant belief that the customers will coming back anyway? We’re at the point where IAG shareholders, as much as BA customers, deserve an explanation. Mystery surrounds, as they say, the latest delay in publication of full-year results of S4 Capital, Sir Martin Sorrell’s comeback vehicle after his acrimonious exit from WPP in 2018. Benign explanations include the one S4 offered at the start of March when announcing the initial delay: PricewaterhouseCoopers needed more time to complete its audit because of Covid’s impact on “travel and resource allocation, particularly in the Netherlands”. An alternative nothing-to-worry-about theory says S4 is merely complicated by its rapid pace of acquisitions. Sorrell tried to encourage calm. “The company believes that the results for 2021 remain within the range of market expectations and continued to trade strongly in the first two months of 2022,” said S4’s late-afternoon statement on Wednesday. The shares crashed by a third anyway, and kept falling on Thursday. That’s 40% off in virtually no time, and one can’t call the nervousness perverse. There’s was no line about Covid or a lack of Dutch number-crunchers in the latest update; the delay was announced on the afternoon before intended publication; no new date was set. The mini-drama may signify nothing, in which case Sorrell would be entitled to put a rocket under PwC. But he might also reflect that companies with conventional governance setups – as opposed to his golden-share gig – are more likely to be given the benefit of the doubt before the facts emerge. The board of Brewin Dolphin, a UK wealth manager with £55bn under management, will not have had to ponder hard. Royal Bank of Canada, a big and serious international outfit, is bidding £1.6bn in cash, representing a mighty 62% takeover premium. That is easy to accept. Rather, one puzzle is whether the UK contains enough wealthy individuals to satisfy everybody’s expansionary ambitions. It’s only a few weeks since Charlie Nunn, new chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, unveiled his data-driven plan to cater for the needs of the “mass affluent”, meaning those with investable assets of more than £70,000. Then there’s the US financial group Raymond James, which bagged Charles Stanley, another venerable UK name. Other Americans have arrived and private equity firms are playing a consolidation game. The mass affluent themselves should ask whether this rush of interest is because managers’ fees in the UK are too fat.",News/Business,BA investors as much as customers deserve explanation for IT woes | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/31/ba-investors-as-much-as-customers-deserve-explanation-for-it-woes
4/1/2022,"To start with, the good news: the British public does not want the NHS to be replaced with an insurance system. Of those questioned for the latest British Social Attitudes survey, 94% support the existence of a health service that is free at the point of delivery and 86% think it should be funded mainly through taxes. But beyond this striking support for the principles that are the service’s bedrock, there is little or no comfort to be found in these results. At 36%, overall satisfaction with the NHS is at its lowest level since 1997. A 17 percentage point fall between 2020 and 2021 in the number who are satisfied is the steepest ever. Troubling though it is to be confronted with such numbers, and the painful reality to which they point – of people not getting the treatment that they need, including for cancer – the crisis now facing the country was not only predictable but predicted. With 7.4 million people on waiting lists for treatment in England, Scotland and Wales, a huge proportion of the population is now being directly affected by delays. Coupled with the publication of Donna Ockenden’s distressing report into failings in maternity care by the Shrewsbury and Telford hospital NHS trust, the research is rightly prompting widespread alarm. The crisis engulfing the system due to long-term underinvestment must not, of course, be elided with the specific events in Shrewsbury. The Ockenden report uncovers appalling failures of management, culture and practice, and concludes that the lives of 201 babies and nine women were needlessly lost. That the investigation took place at all was only down to the courage of the families, in particular those of two babies who died soon after birth – Pippa Griffiths and Kate Stanton Davies. Their parents began the work of collecting other cases. Poor care in Shropshire was compounded by a deadly unwillingness to admit to mistakes, while the hospital became gripped by an erroneous belief in its own success based on a low rate of caesarian deliveries. An adversarial culture, with midwives and doctors in opposing camps, contributed to multiple errors, including a lack of foetal heartbeat monitoring. But while it is essential to note what is distinctive about these findings, resemblances must also be heeded – for example, to failings in maternity care at Morecambe Bay and East Kent. Poor training, staff shortages and weak management are all cited as contributory factors by the Ockenden report. There is no suggestion that all patients face the same risks as pregnant women in Shrewsbury did. But nor are these problems the unique features of a handful of maternity departments. While the current shortage of 2,000 midwives in England is particularly acute, there are rising numbers of vacancies across the NHS and in primary care as well as hospitals. Making it easier to get a GP appointment was the single most popular answer to the question of how the NHS could be improved, cited by 48% of respondents to the British Social Attitudes survey. Boris Johnson fought the 2019 election with a raft of promises to improve the health service. While new investment is being made following years of cuts, specific pledges have not been met. Waiting-time targets that are supposed to be legally binding are broken as a matter of course. Covid is of course a factor in all this, as the public understands. But it is not the only one. With a 184-bed private hospital due to open shortly in London, while the number of NHS vacancies skyrockets, ministers are – through their actions if not their words – showing a preference for the kind of tiered health system that the public rejected in the 1940s. Conservative MPs were whipped to vote against an amendment to recent health legislation that would have made workforce planning a legal requirement. With millions of people queueing for treatment, and suffering while they do it, ministers must support the NHS to meet the needs of the public – as the public demands.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on falling satisfaction with the NHS: broken promises | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/31/the-guardian-view-on-falling-satisfaction-with-the-nhs-broken-promises
4/1/2022,"“Ithink the UK is ensuring that all the Ukrainians don’t come.” Those words, from a refugee in Warsaw, sum up a broader mood. One in four Ukrainians has now fled their home, and at least 4 million have left the country. They have found a warm welcome even in places that generally reject and denigrate refugees. But a relatively small number have reached Britain, and frustration and anger at delays and obstacles are growing. Just 2,700 visas have been granted out of more than 28,000 applications under the “homes for Ukraine” scheme. Another 23,000 have been granted under the family scheme allowing applicants to join relatives in the UK. But in both cases, lengthy waits and what Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, described as Kafkaesque bureaucracy are leaving tens of thousands in limbo and increasingly desperate, with some still in areas under bombardment. British humanitarian workers at the Polish border said that while other nations have been helping refugees find new homes for weeks, not one of 70 visa claims they have assisted with has been approved. The government can take no credit for the fact that around 200,000 people in the UK have now registered as potential hosts, under a scheme that it had to be arm-twisted into introducing. Households are being given no assistance in matching up with those in need – a process being left to social media or charities – and Ukrainians are receiving little help as they tackle the official obstacles to actually reach Britain. While ministers say that they have cut back on the documentation required, more substantive action is clearly required. Several major charities, including Oxfam and the Refugee Council, are calling on the government to waive visas, with security checks carried out on arrival. Scaling up processing is not simple. Underlying the delay and bureaucracy is an asylum system that is geared not to supporting the traumatised, but to rejecting those who come in search of help, and which is underresourced and beset by inertia, because the people at its heart are neither valued nor respected. Ministers continue to treat refugees as a political problem rather than as vulnerable human beings – stoking the hostile attitudes to which they are pandering. In this context, even when the government grants a group special dispensation, they are almost certain to struggle, be they the Ukrainians now fleeing war, or the Afghans evacuated when the Taliban took power last summer, around 11,500 of whom are still stuck in hotels, waiting to find new homes. “This is a country overwhelmingly generous to people coming in fear of their lives,” Boris Johnson insisted on Wednesday. Households across the UK have shown that they are willing to open their hearts to desperate Ukrainians. If only the government would do the same.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Ukraine’s refugees: Britain’s grudging welcome | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/31/the-guardian-view-on-ukraines-refugees-britains-grudging-welcome
