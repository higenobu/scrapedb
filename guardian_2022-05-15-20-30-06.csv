5/15/2022,"It sounds like an idyllic job-share for two working mums – Vicky looked after Emily’s newborn so she could interview for the job they both wanted, while Emily covered for Vicky when she was settling her child into school. But these are not ordinary part-time roles – Vicky and Emily, who cannot reveal their real names for security reasons, are responsible for the entire counter-terrorism mission at GCHQ, the UK’s security and intelligence agency. The pair, who are marking the end of their first year in the role, have described their top-level job-share to the Guardian as their “superpower” which doubles their output and efficiency, and ultimately makes the UK a safer place. The first women to jointly lead the counter-terrorism mission at GCHQ as deputy directors, Vicky and Emily made the decision when Vicky’s baby was just a few months old in May 2020, with Emily covering both roles until Vicky finished her maternity leave. The women, who this week topped a list of the most successful people working part-time compiled by flexible-working specialists Timewise, sketched out the logistics in a series of responses over email. They both work 3.5 days, crossing over on one day. Both their classified and unclassified inboxes are shared – people don’t know which of them is responding. “What we love about it is the partnership we have,” said Vicky. “On a daily basis we are facing new and complex issues. Having a rock-solid support network makes it easier, far more enjoyable and ultimately pays dividends to GCHQ’s biggest intelligence mission.” Asked if they needed to be friends to make it work, Emily said: “It’s somehow more than friendship, as we are so committed to each other professionally and personally – it’s all about faith and trust.” The pair met while working in the US, a decade before they thought about sharing a job. Professionally, they each valued the other’s ability to cut to the chase and solve complex or contentious issues, but after having children, they realised they also had a shared set of values and experiences. “People have said we bounce off each other as we both have so much energy, it’s like the output is doubled – that’s our superpower as a job-share,” said Vicky. A poll commissioned by Timewise to mark 10 years of the part-time power list found that half the UK public still “don’t believe it’s possible to have a part-time career” (down from three-quarters in 2012) while nearly half (48%) said they “would not give a part-time colleague an important or business critical task”. ONS data analysed by the consultancy shows that 750,000 people work part-time in senior level and business critical jobs in the UK. Vicky and Emily insist that having two heads across hugely complex and diversifying terrorism threats enables them to stress-test vital decisions. “We double up on creativity and ability to spot risks and opportunities – which is really essential in our line of work,” said Emily. It is far from easy. Playing a key role in keeping Britons safe gives them a “huge sense of pride”, but a weighty burden of responsibility. “Our teams can feel the weight of personal guilt, grief, and failure for real-world events outside their control,” said Vicky. “It’s critical for us to support them.” But sharing the job means, despite the demands of the role, they are able to see their kids and even – on the odd occasion – have time to think. “It allows the thoughtful part of your brain to step up,” said Emily. “And it really helps you ruthlessly prioritise.” They guard their own, and each other’s, home time fiercely with a “very high threshold” needed for them both to attend an event. “Non-working days are untouchable,” said Vicky. “We both have young children and owe it to them and each other to make sure we role-model. We don’t want to be advocates if in reality it’s not possible to achieve.”",News/UK news,‘Huge sense of pride’: the mothers who job-share counter-terrorism at GCHQ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/15/the-mothers-who-job-share-counter-terrorism-at-gchq
5/15/2022,"The Australian film-maker Leah Purcell adapted (from her own play, which was in turn based on an 1892 short story), directed and stars in this solid outback western. The handsome photography is a stark contrast to the grim realities of the hard-scrabble lives eked out in this unforgiving land. The film tackles issues of race, sexual violence and the low-level simmering cruelty that is a fact of life for those hardy individuals who make a life in the bush in the late 19th century. And there are few more resilient than Molly Johnson (Purcell), heavily pregnant, with a gaggle of kids at her heel and a shotgun ready to train on anyone who comes too close to her shack. Then she meets Yadaka (Rob Collins), an Indigenous man on the run from the police, and an uneasy trust built on shared secrets grows between them.",Arts/Film,The Drover’s Wife: The Legend of Molly Johnson review – one-woman outback western,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/15/the-drovers-wife-the-legend-of-molly-johnson-review-leah-purcell-one-woman-outback-western
5/15/2022,"Prescription charges will be frozen for the first time in 12 years as a gesture to help with cost-of-living pressures, the government has said. The move is one of a number of small measures that government departments have been ordered to find to reduce families’ costs, but comes amid criticism that steps taken so far have done little to ease the burden of rising bills and inflation. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said the freeze on charges, which usually increase in line with average inflation, would save people a total of £17m. The Department of Health said charges for prescriptions would remain at £9.35 for a single charge or £30.25 for a three-month prescription prepayment certificate. “The rise in the cost of living has been unavoidable as we face global challenges and the repercussions of Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine. Whilst we can’t completely prevent these rises, where we can help – we absolutely will,” Javid said. “This is why I am freezing prescription charges to help ease some of these pressures and put money back in people’s pockets.” The general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Frances O’Grady, said on Sunday that the government was not doing nearly enough to help with the cost of living crisis and that workers were being treated like “cash machines”. She called on the chancellor to boost the minimum wage through an emergency budget, telling Sophy Ridge on Sky News: “All the evidence is that prices have been driven by increases in energy prices, certainly not wages, which are set to fall in real terms. “What we need is for the chancellor, who I’m afraid woefully failed working families, to come back with that windfall tax on energy companies that would provide some immediate relief.” The government will face a challenge from Labour on Monday to do more to tackle the cost of living crisis, including the steep rise in energy bills. Labour will put forward an amendment to the Queen’s speech for a one-off windfall tax to help families. Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary of state for climate change and net zero, told Sunday Morning on BBC One: “We are going to give Conservative MPs, the whole House of Commons, a chance to vote on Tuesday on the windfall tax. “I talked about the social emergency in this country. I think it is obscene, frankly, that we have as a result of soaring energy bills, oil and gas companies making billions of pounds in our country, and the government refuses to put a windfall tax on them … It is shameful. It should shame them.”",News/Business,"Prescription charges frozen to help with cost of living crisis, Sajid Javid says",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/15/prescription-charges-frozen-cost-of-living-crisis-sajid-javid
5/15/2022,"‘You know, I’ve never understood the superstition about Friday the 13th,” says budding writer Nic (Michael Karl-Lewis). If only he knew he was in For You I’d Wait, a soft-rock musical about the terrorist attack at the Bataclan theatre on 13 November 2015, he might have bitten his tongue. Or the writers Sophie Golby and Tom West could have bitten it for him. Fresh off the plane (no one in the show has heard of Eurostar), Nic lodges with his sister Dani (Gemma Pearce) and her girlfriend Renee (Billie Kerr). His new home is praised in tourist-board lyrics (“Paris, the city of passion / Wander beneath the Eiffel Tower”) while he waits for his sweetheart Lily (Olivia Walker-Toward) to join him from the UK. “I’m standing on the edge of the world,” she sings. “I’m looking in the eye of the storm.” Is it really that far to Paris from Potters Bar? There is one more couple to meet – pasta enthusiast Christophe (Jerome Lincoln) and his fiancee Eloise (Charlotte Hannan), an Oscar Wilde nut (“He’s my favourite!”) surprised to learn that her idol is buried at Père Lachaise – before these lives converge in the 11th arrondissement. “What happened that night will always haunt me,” sings Nic. Well, quite. It isn’t necessarily a poor idea to make a musical about a harrowing subject (think of London Road) but it would be encouraging to feel the writers’ research had gone beyond watching the Netflix documentary that provided their initial inspiration. If you’re going to have a cast speaking English in their own accents, and you’re intent on making a show about a terrorist atrocity featuring nothing Parisian aside from references to the odd landmark, it seems perverse not to stick closer to home. Wouldn’t 7/7 have sufficed? Hard to say whether rewrites might improve a show prone to repetition (two consecutive numbers involve people leafing through the same photo album) and cliche (“I’m looking for a way to survive / In this crazy messed-up life”) while offering little variety in idiom (several songs reference turning back time or throwing a lifeline).

5/15/2022,"“If your first touch is good, life is easy. If it’s bad, there’s no recovery.” So says charismatic coach Lafferty (watchful Arthur Wilson) to young football hopeful Clayton (the wide-eyed and eager Raphael Akuwudike), who is dreaming of First Division glory in the 1970s. Lafferty is talking about the beautiful game, but his words have an ugly double meaning. He is, as Nathaniel Price’s new play painstakingly demonstrates, taking advantage of his position to groom the 12-year-old boy and sexually abuse him. “Child abuse is an appalling crime against some of the most vulnerable in society, but it is also little discussed or understood… [and] usually hidden from view.” The Office for National Statistics’ 2020 report indicates that 20% of people have been subjected to serious abuse when young and that around 7% of that abuse is sexual. By commissioning work based on this issue, the Playhouse’s artistic director, Adam Penford, is performing an important social service. The finished piece, though, needs to do more than just convey information. As a drama, it needs shape, drive, intensity; it needs passion, engagement – all the elements that, on a pitch, distinguish a match from a training session. In this respect, First Touch falls well short of its goal. Under Jeff James’s direction, the production does its best with the material. Rapid, television-style transitions in time and space are deftly managed. Charlotte Espiner’s set achieves the impossible – simultaneously stadium, sitting room, changing room, factory floor and hairdresser’s salon. Actors fitfully succeed in bringing to life thinly drawn characters and clumsily signposted period attitudes – sexist, racist and political. Sexist attitudes seep into the play itself: Clayton’s girlfriend, Serena (Chloe Oxley), is sexually humiliated in a scene played out before the audience; its function is to indicate how Clayton has been damaged by Lafferty’s abuse. By contrast, Clayton’s experience of abuse is presented in a more distanced, nuanced manner. Lafferty’s final advice to Clayton is: “Keep your head down, mouth shut. Don’t make trouble.” As a drama, Price’s play may be a non-scorer, but its message blasts home: defy the Laffertys; blow the whistle on abuse.

5/15/2022,"The Ukrainian director Oleh Sentsov famously doesn’t pull his punches. Previously sentenced to 20 years in prison by Moscow – the charge was terrorism, his crime was speaking out against the Russian annexation of Crimea – he was released in a prisoner swap and went on to make films that are every bit as muscular and confrontational as his political presence. The latest, Rhino, is a morality tale that unfolds in a 90s Ukrainian underworld full of bullet-headed hard men intent on creating chaos and division. But even among the other gangsters, Vora (Serhii Filimonov), an unstoppable force nicknamed Rhino, is regarded with a degree of trepidation. Described as “a piece of shit with no brakes” by a rival boss, he ploughs through his enemies like an out-of-control threshing machine. He’s not, it has to be said, a particularly interesting or nuanced character. But Sentsov’s deft direction – in particular a bravura single-shot, early-life montage – makes this gory rise and fall story a horribly compelling watch.

5/15/2022,"The cost of living could be the next frontline for scammers, the head of the UK’s specialist police unit for fraud has warned, with criminals using the crisis as a way to lure potential victims. DCI Gary Robinson, head of the Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit (DCPCU), said he thought fraudsters could seize on the financial squeeze to persuade people to hand over their personal details. “The next thing I can foresee is criminals using the cost of living crisis to social-engineer people – they might send messages offering rebates on gas and electricity and play on people’s vulnerabilities,” he said. Robinson was speaking to the Guardian as the DCPCU marked its 20th anniversary and prepared to release figures showing that 2021 was a record year for fraud prevention. The unit, which is funded by the finance industry and made up of officers from the City and Metropolitan police forces together with members of the banking industry, blocked £101m worth of crime last year in operations targeting gangs. Its investigations into scams and frauds involving bank customers led to 123 arrests and disrupted the activities of 23 organised criminal gangs. Since the start of the pandemic, fraudsters have used a range of themes in texts and emails to get people to click on links and give details which were later used to persuade them to hand over money from their accounts. “Fraudsters move with the times – whatever is the latest trend that’s what they tend to switch to,” Robinson said. “Through the pandemic we started with vaccines, then we went to tax rebates as people were working from home, then back to vaccines, then delivery scams as people were shopping online. Then we saw an increase in romance scams as people were lonely at home.” Work by the unit led to several convictions related to Covid scams, including one person who had harvested victims’ details by sending out texts claiming to be from the NHS. The £101m figure for prevention is based on the estimated value of a crime that would have taken place had the unit not seized data or equipment such as devices containing personal data and card skimming tools. Robinson said the unit had benefited from the increased support of telecoms and social media in tracking down criminals, who were increasingly reliant on technology to find their victims. “Years ago we would execute a warrant and when got into the property there would be an old-style filing cabinet which you’d pull out and find stolen cards and counterfeit cheques,” he said. “Things happen now in a faceless way.” During the pandemic fraud levels soared, and last year UK Finance reported £754m had been stolen from bank customers in just six months. Robinson said cases taken on by the unit, which focuses on the organised crime gangs behind frauds, took time to work through, in part because of the scale of the fraudsters’ operations. “Our desire is not to just take out the low-level criminals but to climb to the top of the tree,” he said. Shared intelligence resulting from the unit, and its 20 years of experience, made this possible. While some crimes involved bank insiders, perhaps placed there by organised gangs, many involved scammers pretending to be from banks and building societies’ fraud departments. Robinson said his work had made him wary of calls he received. “My bank rang me the other day about a transaction and my initial thought was ‘is this my bank’,” he said. Rather than responding straight away he said he always stopped and made checks first. “It’s OK to reject, refuse or ignore any requests that they’re making. Criminals will try to rush you but your bank or the police won’t.”",Lifestyle/Money,"Scammers will hope to exploit cost of living crisis, say UK police",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/15/scammers-exploit-cost-living-crisis-police-card-crime
