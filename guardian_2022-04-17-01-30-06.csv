4/17/2022,"Cometh the hour, cometh Cristiano Ronaldo for seemingly the umpteenth time this season to save Manchester United. After 75 minutes the score was level and Ralf Rangnick’s side were teetering on the brink of yet another capitulation after holding a two-goal lead. But then Ronaldo smashed a 25-yard free-kick in off Tim Krul’s right post and that was 3-2 – and a second hat-trick since 12 March for a 37-year-old who now has 15 Premier League goals this season. Until his intervention this contest was being written up as the latest surrender of a sorry season from Rangnick’s band. Today’s theme had been lax marking and errant defensive positioning: both Kieran Dowell and Teemu Pukki benefited from amateurish execution of basic tenets of the game. Norwich deserved maximum credit for their fightback from a 2-0 deficit and the result was heading for the last thing United needed after the dire 1-0 loss at Everton, especially against the backdrop of renewed protests against the Glazer family’s ownership that began before kick-off. But Ronaldo’s supreme career is built on him penning the narrative and, with Arsenal losing at Southampton, United are up to fifth and three points behind Tottenham, who were also defeated on Saturday. What ended in the right result for United had also begun brightly in late spring sunshine. They were in control precisely as they should be against the league’s bottom-placed side who arrived here seven points from safety. There was a hogging of possession that fluttered about 62% in the first half and, most vitally, there were goals. The first came on seven minutes. United fanned out to pressure a restart from Krul. He tapped the ball to Ben Gibson who fed it to Dimitris Giannoulis. The left-back returned it but Gibson dawdled, was pilfered by Anthony Elanga and when the youngster passed to Ronaldo he rolled home. Cue the latter and former doing Ronaldo’s trademark jump-and-turn celebration to cries of “siuuu” from jubilant fans hailing their Portuguese hero. The opener was a function of Elanga’s hunger to hunt the ball down. United’s second came from a corner and was close to a carbon copy of Ronaldo’s late winner against Tottenham, which came from the same brute strength and aerial prowess on display here. Alex Telles, in for Luke Shaw who may not return from injury until next season, flighted over a corner from the right and Ronaldo’s leap was the familiar one: an almost cartoonish show of power and height as the hapless Gibson was bulldozed aside and Krul was beaten once more. It gave United a cushion that, surely, would allow them to pitter-patter passes around, move their opponent out of position, accumulate more goals and clinch a confidence-boosting victory. A sweet sequence that featured the type of football that has been largely awol this term emphasised that feeling: Paul Pogba curved a ball right that hit Elanga, he switched it left to Jadon Sancho and his dazzling feet allowed him to go close to creating a third for Ronaldo. Yet by the 52nd minute United had twice been exposed. First Pukki fashioned a one-two with Giannoulis that punched holes in the home defence. The Finn popped over a cross and Dowell headed in. Next came a role reversal: the No 10 passed beyond Victor Lindelöf to Pukki, who stepped forward to pinball the equaliser in off David de Gea’s left post. This collapse was United’s season in microcosm and the question was what might follow from the protesters if the score remained or became worse for Rangnick’s men. Throughout choruses of “we want Glazers out” and “you’re not fit to wear the shirt”, as well as chants directed at Pogba when he was substituted, were heard. Ronaldo, though, had the final word.",Sport/Football,Cristiano Ronaldo hits hat-trick to give Manchester United edge over Norwich,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/16/manchester-united-norwich-premier-league-match-report
4/17/2022,"When the war began, Olga Gladysheva, a former journalist who now works in video production, joined tens of thousands of other Russians fleeing the country. “I left for Istanbul in a state of panic shortly after the war started. I thought I wouldn’t get another chance to leave, that the borders might close. I didn’t want to stay alone in the country as I saw all my friends leaving. I thought Russia was turning into North Korea,” she said. But in Turkey her bank cards were blocked and she could not transfer money home to support her mother in Moscow. She survived by asking favours from friends who had access to funds. Now, reluctantly, she has returned home. “I came back last week. Bluntly speaking, money is the main reason I had to return. I have a flat in Moscow that I was still paying for. I had the option to work from a distance but it wasn’t the easiest option and I would earn more here in Moscow. Life wasn’t sustainable for me in Turkey.” As Russia’s war nears its third month with no end in sight, the hurried decisions that many Russians made to flee have hit the hard realities of emigration abroad, particularly at a time of closed borders and banking sanctions. While many Russians have left for ever, others have been drawn back to care for ailing parents, manage businesses, keep their families together or simply to make ends meet. “It was a real family drama,” said Roman, a tech startup co-founder who returned from Armenia last week. “I thought we needed to get as far from Russia as possible. My wife didn’t want to go anywhere and I had to search for some compromise. It was a matter of choice: leave Russia without my wife or come back with my wife. So I decided to come here with my wife and to see what happens.” Experts say the wave of Russian migration provoked by the war is unusual, sparked by rumours of a forced mobilisation in early March and led by highly educated workers often travelling to smaller countries. And at least on paper, many have the option to return for either short trips or permanently. Artem Taganov, the founder of the tech startup HintEd, left for Armenia in early March as part of the exodus of Russia’s tech sector. His partner and investors had urged him to leave the country immediately because of fears of a forced mobilisation, he said, and he had made plans to open a new company in Armenia. But after five weeks in the capital, Yerevan, he had returned to Moscow temporarily because of family and business concerns. “The idea [in Armenia] was to open a company but it’s paused because I’m waiting for some money. My wife and my dog are still in Moscow, my wife can’t leave her work right now,” he said. She had been working at an institute partnered with a British arts university that may terminate its agreements in Russia this year. “I’m trying to convince her to move. And still I have some business here, so we still need to support my company here.” It was an uneasy homecoming. His parents, who live in another city and support the war, have told him he was wrong to leave Russia. He says he finds it difficult to call them and does not expect to see them until the conflict ends. “When I was returning I was afraid that there would be a lot of cars with Z or V [symbols supporting the war] but I’ve only seen one,” he said. “Still, the atmosphere is really heavy here. All our mass media says that a lot of people support the war but that’s not true. In my close circle nobody supports it. Everybody here is afraid even to talk about this ‘special operation’. Nobody is smiling and everyone is sad.” A senior executive at one of Russia’s largest IT companies said he had noticed the return of younger employees with lower salaries who had been priced out of cities such as Yerevan, Istanbul and Tbilisi. “People left in a panic and then after some time they realised: ‘OK, how are we going to continue living?’” the executive said. “They still hate the situation, they still disagree and they still psychologically feel uncomfortable and they don’t want to come back. But there’s no way not to come back.” There are no firm estimates of how many Russians left the country after the start of the war, which the Kremlin has termed a “special operation”. While tech workers may have strong prospects abroad, others may find their skills and education don’t translate across borders. Dmitry, an art consultant, said he was in “shock” when the war started and fled the country due to rumours of a forced mobilisation. “I flew to Uzbekistan, one of the easiest places I could visit without a visa. I returned to Moscow in late March when it became clear that the forced mobilisation was just a rumour. I realised that Europe was not an option for me. I am not sure Europe is waiting for Russians to come, even those that are against the war. What would I even do there? I barely speak any English.” Ira Lobanovskaya, who runs an organisation helping Russians to settle abroad, said: “Many left during the wave out of panic, just to have a breather. I see that some people are returning now. But I know that some of those who returned are making plans to leave again. They just needed to go back to Russia to get all their stuff, organise their papers and make concrete plans to properly leave.” A number of factors could make it difficult for Russians travelling abroad, said Katrin Sommerfeld, a researcher at the Mannheim-based Centre for European Economic Research who focuses on refugee immigration. She has published a paper calling on German policymakers to bring forward a strategy on how to deal with migrants from Russia. “Prices are rocketing in the countries where these individuals are going to,” she said. “You’re only allowed to take $10,000 abroad from Russia. You can’t access your bank account. The rouble has devalued. So it’s harder to get your money and it is worth less. Things are very expensive. This makes it difficult and could perhaps feed into return migration, because if your money is burnt and it doesn’t work abroad then what are you going to do?” Some of those returning say they are often surprised by the indifference to the war. “The main impression for me is that people are kind of accepting it,” said the tech executive. “The war is bad and Putin is evil but life continues. It’s more or less alright here, the exchange rate is alright even if it is imaginary, some stuff disappeared from shops but it’s not as bad as we thought, the prices grew but it’s not that bad. It has really depressed me seriously to the bottom of my heart.” In a recent poll, over half of Russians said they were not closely following the war. “I thought I would witness horrible scenes on the streets, that people would be filled with pro-war anger, but life actually just goes on,” said Olga Gladysheva. “All the bars and restaurants are still packed every evening. It feels like people are ignoring the war – but that is scary too.”",News/World news,Russians who fled at outbreak of Ukraine war reluctantly go home ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/16/russians-who-fled-at-outbreak-of-ukraine-war-reluctantly-go-home
4/17/2022,"Manchester United fans staged a peaceful protest against the Glazers’ ownership involving about 1,000 people which caused Old Trafford’s corporate venues and the club megastore to be closed before Norwich City’s visit. Those demonstrating did not enter the game until the 17th minute – one for every year of the American family’s proprietorship. The demonstration, organised by a group calling itself the 1958, began at 2pm outside the Tollgate pub, and had its focal point inside the stadium’s Munich Tunnel, where the directors’ entrance is situated and which protesters brought to a standstill. The crowd chanted: “Love United, stay outside”, “Joel Glazer is going to die” and “We want Glazers out”. Joel Glazer is a co-chairman and one of six siblings who are proprietors. Crowds had begun to gather at 11am at the Tollgate with close to a thousand present then. “It was about 900 people,” a policewoman said. When the march began it took around 15 minutes, flares being let off along the walk and on arrival outside Old Trafford. Riot police were situated at the directors’ entrance and at the mouth of the Munich Tunnel and the decision was taken to close many of the entrances to the club’s corporate venues and the store as kick off approached. While the game began on time, fans inside the ground unhappy at the owners sang anti-Glazer chants. It was unclear how many supporters refused to enter until 3.17pm, with the stadium appearing close to full at the start. On Friday, a group of about 30 supporters had gathered outside United’s Carrington training base before the weekly media conference of Ralf Rangnick, the interim manager. Some of those in attendance displayed a banner with a message daubed on it that read: “Disgrace not fit to wear the shirt. 1958.” The latter group laid out its message via a post on social media. “This is more about the next generation picking up the baton and having a club to be proud of again to hand to future generations,” it said.",Sport/Football,Manchester United fans stage anti-Glazer protest before Norwich game,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/16/manchester-united-fans-stage-anti-glazer-protest-before-norwich-game
4/17/2022,"Fallen Women Tortoise MediaIain Dale LBCKevin O’Sullivan talkRadioA House in History Radio 4 | BBC SoundsThe Skewer Radio 4 | BBC SoundsBetween the Ears: A Society of Recordists Radio 3 | BBC SoundsGary Davies in for Zoe Ball Radio 2 | BBC Sounds Another true crime podcast centred around a young woman’s death. Was it murder? The police thought not, but the podcast, through careful examination of the facts, dares to wonder. This might not sound an exciting prospect (perhaps it even sounds standard, though if it does, should we think about that?), but Fallen Women, from Tortoise, is more than the usual whodunnitreally? podcast. In it, the dedicated, brilliant investigative journalist Louise Tickle re-examines the death of Bianca Thomas, a young mother of three who died in August 2018. Bianca fell from the balcony of an 11th-floor flat of a residential tower block in Birmingham. Her ex-boyfriend was in the flat at the time. Tickle interviews the only witness, Brian Suffolk, who happened to be standing outside the block. He saw Bianca with her back to the balcony wall, facing inwards. He heard an argument. Then Suffolk saw Bianca’s body move upwards and flip over the edge of the balcony and down headfirst. “The screaming on the way down… I’ll never forget it.” Tickle talks to Bianca’s younger sister. She visits the flat, to check on the balcony. She talks to a forensic criminologist, Dr Claire Ferguson. She does all the things you expect… and it makes, as ever, no difference. But Tickle also enlists the help of Ellen Halliday, a Tortoise reporter, and they find other cases of falling women. Fifty-one, in fact, who were seriously injured or killed by falling from a height, 27 in circumstances deemed suspicious. They go through those, and what they find, in the background of most of them, is a man. As Tickle says: “Twenty-seven falls. Seventeen deaths. A man almost always arrested at the scene and then almost always released without charge.” As she also says: “Standing in the shadow of her fall.” Perhaps you think this is paranoia: women seeing bad things when they aren’t really there. But Tickle and Halliday also look at deaths of men from falling. They find that, out of 38, only five were deemed suspicious and almost all happened in a public place, with other people present: a party, a train station, a work do. The contrast is stark. Tickle, who has long experience in investigating difficult domestic abuse cases (she made Hidden Homicides), knows how to spot the signs: with these falling women, patterns of abusive behaviour are being missed. In domestic murder cases, often the perpetrator will try and make the death look like suicide or an accident. But if you don’t approach a death scene as though it’s a murder, how can you collect the evidence? Every chief of police should listen to this podcast and we should be collecting data. At the end, Tickle lists all the names of the women who died by falling. We owe it to them. Still, in these “can we get away with it?” days, who will care enough or be careful enough to do the research, think about the victims? We’re governed by those who can’t be bothered with details and who think victims are losers, by definition. On Tuesday evening, an interesting discussion on Iain Dale’s LBC evening show Cross Question. Four guests: Phillip Blond, ex-adviser to David Cameron; the Fabian Society’s Andrew Harrop; Dr Alan Mendoza from the Henry Jackson Society and the Guardian columnist Zoe Williams. The conversation was stimulating and articulate, with some great listener questions. (Incidentally, earlier in the show, a long-time Conservative party member phoned in to say he had handed in his membership due to Johnson’s lying.) Over on talkRadio, I was hoping for more chatty intelligence. Instead, Kevin O’Sullivan was discussing Doctor Who “going woke”. Phrases such as “having an agenda” and “hammering home a message” (re the romance between Doctor Who and Yasmin, as though lesbians just don’t exist) were followed – bizarrely – by an attack on Jodie Whittaker for how she plays the character. “Completely derivative, she behaves like any other Doctor!” barked O’Sullivan. This, after 15 minutes of slagging off the show for not being exactly like it once was. O’Sullivan is a clever man, yet this is dire stuff. For some jokes to cheer us all up, why not try Radio 4’s new comedy A House in History? It’s a mickey take of those TV programmes that put a family in a house from the past. Though slightly slow to start, the show ramped up into some satisfyingly silly strangeness, exemplified by Alistair Green, who played Phil, the father. Some great lines, too. Just before that, for fans of the even stranger, The Skewer is back, with its doctored, real-life audio and bizarre hallucinatory feel. Jon Holmes, who’s been working at the radio coalface for many years, has won several well-deserved awards for this show. He also invites new writers to contribute. Excellent.

4/17/2022,"It was a bad day at the office for Northern Ireland manager, Kenny Shiels. Discussing his team’s 5-0 defeat to England on Tuesday, a loss that ended their hopes for the 2023 Women’s World Cup, he explained that “girls and women are more emotional than men, so they take a goal and then they don’t take that very well”. It wasn’t a slip of the tongue. He went on to explain his theory, using statistics about how often a second goal is conceded quickly after the first. “That’s an emotional goal,” he suggested. After a minute or so of chat about the subject, there was a telltale pause. “I shouldn’t have told you that,” he said. Perhaps the emotion of the occasion got the better of him. It wouldn’t be the first time Shiels had put his foot in it and he proved to have impeccable analytical skills regarding his own post-match press conference, at least, because he really shouldn’t have told us that. His remarks quickly drew condemnation and it was hard to know which eyeroll should come first. Was it for the casual sexism, the stereotypes, for a man becoming the centre of attention during a big night for women, or for the implication that emotions in sport are inherently negative, a view that damages both men and women? And you do have to wonder when Shiels last watched men play any sport. There’s more drama in a Sunday league match than in the Christmas episode of EastEnders. “Kenny Shiels talking foolishness,” said Ian Wright, posting pictures of himself in tears on the pitch. This was the same week that the two-part documentary Gazza began on BBC2, a story stuffed with players’ emotions and emotional havoc, in the same week that Ronaldo hit a phone out of a 14-year-old’s hand after Manchester United lost to Everton. Still, women, eh? With their special lady emotions, getting all lady-upset about the goals! By the end of the week, Shiels emerged from the furore a little bruised, but after a sincere-sounding apology, his job was intact and he had the support of his team. I found the whole fiasco quite heartening in the end, which is weird, because I probably should have had a meltdown and cried about it. What stood out most is that 10 years ago, comments like this probably wouldn’t have caused much of a fuss. Instead, the near-unified reaction to it offered a clear indication of where the women’s game is going and what it is leaving behind. Backstage at the Olivier awards last Sunday, Liz Carr, who had just won best supporting actress for her role in The Normal Heart at the National, told the BBC thatshe had not been to a theatre in over two years. “This is a frightening night for me,” she said, explaining that, while she had appeared on stage in front of an audience during that time, she was surrounded by a cast and crew who were testing for Covid every day. Now that face covering rules have been lifted, audiences are no longer legally obliged to wear masks and in my experience of live performances recently, it seems that more choose not to than choose to. That’s the law. But Carr suggested a solution for those who do not feel comfortable, or able, to put their health at the mercy of other people’s choice to wear a mask or not. She suggested special performances, with mandatory mask-wearing and less capacity, so that those with health conditions aren’t excluded from going to the theatre. The Royal Shakespeare Company put on a reduced capacity performance of Much Ado About Nothing last month, asking audience members to wear masks, for this exact reason. It makes absolute sense and should be more widespread. On The One Show last Wednesday, the actor Dan Stevens took a run up to his punchline as if he were doing the long jump. Asked about Gaslit, his new series about Richard Nixon, he talked of “a criminal for a leader who is wrapped in a messy war, embroiled in a stupid scandal and surrounded by ambitious idiots and really should resign”. You could see what was coming, though the presenters seemed shocked when he stuck the landing and revealed he was talking about Boris Johnson instead. They didn’t know where to look or what to say. Obviously, the clip went viral. It was a spiky interlude for the BBC show, which is usually so cosy you could wear it as a dressing gown. I know it was Stevens going rogue, but the government’s rule-breaking is cutting through to the sofas on an early evening chatshow. On Twitter, the amiable TV host Rylan Clarke-Neal found himself arguing with, and gaining the upper hand over, Edwina Currie, who tried the “move on” defence, to weaker and weaker effect. This is Matt Lucas spoofing Johnson’s ineptitude on Bake Off. It’s Ant & Dec’s “good evening, prime minister... for now” on I’m a Celebrity. These are not BBC4 documentaries watched by 700 people on a good night. These are at the heart of mainstream TV. For all the right-leaning front pages urging the public to move on from partygate – some people break the law in office, get over it! – it’s the light entertainment test that may prove telling in the end.

4/17/2022,"Motorists faced a traditionally busy Easter Saturday on the roads as travellers headed off for the bank holiday weekend. According to the AA, there were some delays on the motorways, however congestion was minimal and far less of a problem than it was on Good Friday. The organisation predicted a total of 27.6m journeys will be made this weekend, as people choose cars over train to avoid engineering works. A crash on the M6 on Saturday caused delays of up to 40 minutes, while the M25 remained slow in the west around Heathrow and in the east near Dartford. AA president Edmund King said routes to the south-west were clearer than they were on Good Friday, although there were some delays on the M4 and M5 near Bristol. “I have driven 176 miles in three-and-a-half hours from Hertfordshire to Old Trafford and charged the car on the way,” King said. “Overall, the picture is busy but generally the traffic is flowing.” The RAC suggested the best time to hit major roads was after 3pm on both Saturday and Sunday, and either before 10.30am or after 6.30pm on Monday to avoid major queues. One issue that could blight travel plans for holidaymakers this weekend is fuel shortages, but the Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), which represents independent forecourts, said it was not aware of any widespread problems. “We are aware of protests at several fuel supply sites, however, the majority are unaffected,” Gordon Balmer, the executive director of PRA, said.“Fuel suppliers are working hard to ensure fuels are being delivered as quickly as possible and our members are working closely with them and following their advice.” However, one woman in east London said she had visited five different stations before she was able to fill up. “I’ve managed to get some now at a Texaco petrol station but only two pumps were working,” she said. Network Rail is scheduled to carry out 530 engineering projects, including the closure of the west coast mainline between London Euston and Milton Keynes until Tuesday to upgrade the existing line and work on HS2. Those travelling across the Channel faced significant disruption after P&O Ferries suspended all passenger services on its Dover-Calais route before the weekend while ships remain docked owing to safety concerns.

4/17/2022,"Language schools for foreign students are being “devastated” by a combination of post-Brexit red tape and the impact of the pandemic, threatening the future of a £3.2bn industry, tourism leaders have warned. A report by the Tourism Alliance said even though the government had ended Covid travel measures, ministers had imposed unnecessary restrictions on children from France, Germany and other EU nations. That has prompted a collapse in school group bookings and an estimated 80% drop in revenue across the industry this year, threatening 40,000 jobs, the Tourism Alliance said. Until 2021, more than 1.5 million children came to the UK each year to study English or on organised school trips, accounting for about 11% of total annual tourism earnings. Before Brexit, groups of children could travel using identity cards under the List of Travellers scheme. Now, every child must have a passport, and children with non-EU passports – including refugees – also need a £95 visa. Schools are opting to go to Ireland or Malta for English language trips, or not travelling at all. Kurt Janson, the director of the Tourism Alliance, said the passport requirement was having “a devastating impact on a large number of small businesses and local communities”. “The collapse in the school group market is unnecessary as schoolchildren present no security risk, will not disappear into the black economy and start driving minicabs, and parents who let their children go on school trips are generally quite keen for their teachers to bring them back home. “This is an obvious situation where the government needs to set aside its dogma on passports and work with the industry to find a practical solution.” Many language schools are concentrated in seaside towns on the south coast of England. In Hastings, the council says only seven of its 20 language schools and tour operators are confirmed to be still running. One is Senlac Tours, which usually brings about 15,000 children, mostly from Berlin, to Hastings each year. They stay with local families, learn English and visit British cultural destinations. “We haven’t had any groups since March 2020,” said Nicole Taggeb, the executive manager. Many staff have been laid off. “Had it not been for our boss, putting money aside, selling her home, selling the office and supporting the company like that, we might not have survived,” she said. “We’re just hoping to get back to some sort of turnover. “First we had Brexit, then Covid, and now the war in Ukraine – it’s another nail.” The firm’s first group since Covid is due to arrive from Germany by coach this month. Covid restrictions in European countries make things more complex, but the passport requirement has put off many parents. “It costs about €450 per child,” Taggeb said. “Now it would be another €100.” Many don’t even consider travelling any more – not all Germans have passports and about 15% of schoolchildren in Germany are nationals of other countries. About 22% of jobs in the town – 7,030 – are supported by tourism, according to Hastings borough council. “We think language schools are worth £35m to the local economy,” said Kevin Boorman, the council’s marketing manager. “People elsewhere don’t understand that Hastings is the most deprived town in south-east England. The loss of students has an impact on the whole town. We know Hastings is improving and the tourism industry provides entry-level jobs. To lose language students is a massive blow to every generation.” Huan Japes, membership director of English UK, the trade body for language schools, said 15% of members had closed permanently. “There’s another 15% that are not certain if they’ll see out the year,” he said. “We could be seeing a 30% loss across the country.”",News/Education,"40,000 jobs at risk as foreign pupils shun UK language schools",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/16/40000-jobs-at-risk-as-foreign-pupils-shun-uk-language-schools-brexit-covid
4/17/2022,"Elisa Longo Borghini won the second edition of the women’s Paris-Roubaix after blowing away the field with a solo raid more than 30 kilometres from the famous velodrome, to take victory in dominant fashion. After catching a three-rider breakaway group, Longo Borghini attacked over the top on the cobbles and never looked back. For the Italian, the victory had added meaning after what she admitted had been a difficult period personally. “It’s been a very tough spring for me. I had anxieties for a month, and I couldn’t really perform the way I wanted. I knew I was worth more than what I was performing and it was a little bit frustrating. It was a little bit of a hard time,” Longo Borghini told Velo News post-race. “[Trek-Segafredo] brought me to this race and I was like: ‘I don’t think I’m ready. I really don’t want to do it’, and they kept saying ‘you’re more than ready and we know you are capable of doing this’. So, I have to say that they were right.” The race was missing its inaugural winner and Longo Borghini’s Trek teammate Lizzie Deignan, who is expecting her second child. Marianne Vos, cycling’s most decorated woman, was also absent from the start line after testing positive for Covid-19. Looking barely troubled by the cobblestones, Longo Borghini, twice a bronze medallist at the Olympics and also in the world championships road race, had victory virtually in the bag after the Carrefour de l’Arbre – the last demanding cobbled section. Belgian Lotte Kopecky had blown the race open with a brutal burst away from the peloton with 52km to go, but the Italian counterattacked and got away on the Templeuve sector. After that Longo Borghini proved uncatchable, extending her advantage over the chasing group and still holding a 41-second lead with 12 kilometres to go. The chasing pack came closer in the final stages, but Longo Borghini was not going to be denied. She held off her rivals to celebrate in the Roubaix velodrome, crossing the line 23 seconds in front of Team SD Worx rider Kopecky, who beat Lucinda Brand (Trek-Segafredo) in the sprint for second place.

4/17/2022,"Timing is everything. Suspicions that Boris Johnson had broken lockdown rules nearly toppled him in January. Yet now the prime minister looks safe, even as suspicion becomes fact with the issuing of a fixed penalty notice by the police. Johnson’s strong response to the international crisis provoked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine appears to have saved him for now, though with more fines probably still to come, and Sue Gray’s final report looming, his position remains perilous. The lockdown party scandals have turned a lot of voters against Johnson. His average net approval ratings across seven national pollsters collapsed from -9 last September to -40 in January. At rock bottom, the prime minister’s ratings were as bad as Margaret Thatcher’s during the poll tax crisis or Gordon Brown’s at the height of the financial crisis. Johnson was less popular with voters in January than Jeremy Corbyn was during the 2019 election campaign. The Johnson brand as a politician with unique popular appeal looked completely shot. The prime minister has recovered somewhat since his low ebb, with an average net approval in the latest figures of -25, up 15 points on January. This rebound should not be overstated. Despite a relatively favourable news agenda, Johnson’s ratings today remain at or below the worst figures he recorded before partygate. The prime minister is less popular now than he was, for example, during the height of the winter 2020 Covid lockdown crisis. Last summer’s vaccine honeymoon now looks a distant memory. Johnson is seen as weaker, less competent, less trustworthy and less likable that at any point pre-partygate. Police fines and further revelations will reinforce this shift. The damage done by wine fridges and lockdown discos cannot be undone. Things may yet get worse. Public hostility to the prime minister could leach into views of his party and its policies. As Labour discovered in 2019, popular policies lose their lustre when associated with an unpopular frontman. Motives are distrusted; the ability to deliver is called into question. Good ideas cannot save bad leaders. Nor is the political agenda likely to offer the government much relief, as the costs of crisis abroad begin to bite at home through soaring food and energy prices, rising taxes and sinking living standards. Calls for collective sacrifice will ring hollow coming from politicians seen by the public as playing by their own rules. The Conservatives’ advantage as economic managers, long one of their electoral trump cards, has already been worn away, with worse news still to come. Paradoxically, the dire economic situation has helped shore up Johnson’s position by accelerating the collapse of his main rival, chancellor Rishi Sunak. Sunak’s response to the pandemic was widely praised, and at the height of partygate a popular chancellor untainted by scandal looked to many backbenchers like an attractive alternative. Now Sunak is weighed down by policy blunders, his own scandals and his own fine for breaking lockdown rules. He is now even less popular than his boss. Johnson’s personal security may depend on his advantages over internal rivals, but it is the competition with Labour’s Keir Starmer that will determine the fate of his government. Though Starmer’s own ratings are not stellar, he is well ahead of themuch diminished prime minister. If he can maintain this advantage, then Labour will head into the next election with the better-rated leader for the first time since the early years of Tony Blair’s premiership. Yet it is also Labour that provides an embattled government with some sources of hope. Voters remain lukewarm about Starmer, and despite all Johnson’s troubles he still often fights the Labour leader to a draw on the question of who would make the best prime minister. Public scepticism of the opposition’s capacity to govern remains widespread. Amid all the encouraging signs for Labour lies one worrying precedent. In 1986, a Labour leader who had worked hard to restore his party’s credibility held a large lead over a scandal-tainted incumbent struggling with economic problems. A year later, Neil Kinnock faded and Margaret Thatcher rebounded to a third election victory. Boris Johnson may be down, but he is not yet out.

4/17/2022,"Teachers are “popping pills” and are on long-term sick leave, ground down by a culture of non-stop school emails and WhatsApp messages that “ding and ping” day and night, a conference has been told. Delegate after delegate took to the platform at the annual conference of the NASUWT teachers’ union in Birmingham to condemn the increase in workload and describe the devastating impact on health and wellbeing. Meanwhile, teachers who are almost at the end of their tether are being offered finger painting, “knit and natter” and mindfulness sessions as schools do their best to support struggling staff, the conference heard. Owain Morgan-Lee, a delegate from Flintshire, told members: “We know which colleagues are off long-term sick because they’re popping pills to try to cheer themselves up because the job has ground them down to the point where their health is in a serious, serious, condition. It’s grinding down our morale, grinding down the good teachers of the UK.” Morgan-Lee said his school had tried to help by holding a wellbeing session for teachers on a training day. He was offered finger-painting in the art department, a round of gold on the school field, and “knit and natter” in the textiles class, but decided on mindfulness. “Lying on the sweaty, cold, hall floor, thinking about what noise my knees were making, how my toes felt, and what that grape tasted like and how it felt in my mouth,” he said. “I wondered how many more seconds or minutes I’d have to do that for, before the stress, the anxiety, the fear of going back into the classroom and logging on to my school emails, how many more minutes I’d have to do that for before it all ebbed away and I reached nirvana.” Morgan-Lee said none of this would ease the workload crisis. “What we need colleagues is real, tangible change. We don’t need sticking plasters. We need real tangible change to workload and we need it now.” Damien McNulty, from the union’s national executive, warned workload was driving teachers out of the profession. “We’ve got a 24/7 culture where telephones, tablets and smartphones are turned on,” and when school leaders cannot get a response to emails out of working hours they set up WhatsApp groups that “ding and ping all evening when you’re trying to get some rest and relaxation”. He said: “This is just not on. Enough is enough. It’s time for a limit. No more will we put up with excessive workload.” NASUWT members voted unanimously in favour of a campaign to have limits set on their working hours and called on the union to campaign to promote teachers’ rights to a work-life balance. According to an NASUWT survey of 4,000 UK members, nine out of 10 (91%) have seen an increase in workload in the last year – 61% said it had increased significantly – with full-time teachers working 57 hours a week in a typical midterm week. Teachers who took part in the poll said they had spent more time on pastoral care, admin, data and assessment in the last year, as well as teaching, remote learning and dealing with parents. More than four out of five (84%) believe their job has adversely affected their mental health in the last year, with 52% citing workload as the key factor. Dr Patrick Roach, the NASUWT general secretary, said: “No teacher should expect to be subject to levels of workload pressure that will make them ill or force them out of a job they love. Teachers deserve a better deal, which must include a contractual entitlement to a limit on their workload and working hours.” The Department for Education has been approached for comment.",News/Education,"UK teachers popping pills as workload grinds them down, union told",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/16/uk-teachers-popping-pills-workload-grinds-down-union-nasuwt
