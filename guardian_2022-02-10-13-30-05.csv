2/10/2022,"The Coalition has shelved its divisive religious discrimination laws after amendments aimed at protecting LGBTQ+ students sparked a backlash from religious schools and conservatives. Facing calls from the Christian lobby to dump the amended laws, the government said it had received legal advice from the attorney general’s department that showed lower house amendments passed in the early hours of Thursday morning may have unintended consequences.  The attorney general, Michaelia Cash, has written to the independent MP Rebekha Sharkie and Labor over the amendments, saying she has “significant concerns” that the change could inadvertently worsen discrimination. But shadow attorney general Mark Dreyfus blasted the backdown as “a desperate attempt by Mr Morrison to cover up his humiliating defeat on the floor of the House”. “It’s long past time Mr Morrison stopped trying to blame everyone else, stopped playing politics with the lives of children, and worked with the parliament to fix his bills,” Dreyfus said. The advice allegedly relates to proposed changes to the Sex Discrimination Act (SDA) which were supported by Liberal MPs Bridget Archer, Trent Zimmerman, Katie Allen, Fiona Martin and Dave Sharma – who crossed the floor to vote with Labor and crossbench MPs. The government is refusing to release the advice on the amendments, which would prevent religious schools from discriminating against students on gender and sexuality. Despite expectations the bill would be introduced into the Senate on Thursday, the government faced calls from the Australian Christian Lobby to withdraw the bill. The lobby argued the SDA changes would “remove protections for Christian schools”. The government faced the prospect of the amendments also passing the Senate after the Liberal senator, Andrew Bragg, put the government on notice of his intention to back the SDA changes along with Labor and a number of crossbench senators. In a statement, the Australian Christian Lobby’s Wendy Francis said the bill was intended to help faith-based schools “but they now do more harm than good”. “Taking away protections for Christian schools is a price too high to pay for the passage of the religious discrimination bill. The amendments voted on by Labor, independents and these Liberal MPs unnecessarily interfere with the operation of faith-based schools.” The assistant attorney general, Amanda Stoker, said on Thursday morning that the government was consulting with stakeholder groups to make sure “we can fully appreciate the implications of that amendment before we have to deal with the Senate”. The government was “really intent on honouring the commitment we made to all of the multicultural groups, to all other religious groups, and also all of the LGBTI groups in the consultation process that we’ve undertaken,” Stoker said. The decision to delay the bill’s introduction into the Senate means it is unlikely religious discrimination laws will pass parliament before the election, due by May. However, it’s understood the government is still negotiating with crossbench MPs in both the lower house and the Senate, along with its own members who have supported the changes to the Sex Discrimination Act, to try to break the impasse. In the letter sent to Sharkie and Dreyfus on Thursday, Cash says “concerns have been raised” with her about the SDA changes, suggesting the new drafting of section 37(4) “could allow religious schools to discriminate against students or prospective students on grounds which are currently prohibited”. “By expressly stating that it is unlawful for a religious education institution to discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity, marital or relationship status or pregnancy, this drafting leaves open the possibility of religious schools to discriminate on other grounds, being a student or prospective student’s sex, intersex status or breastfeeding.” Sharkie said she had not yet received the legal advice underpinning the letter, but had requested it, “and, if released, will consider that advice carefully”. “However, I have deep concerns over the cited but unseen ‘legal advice’ and have a sense of deja vu after the government previously misrepresented legal advice on the medevac transfer bill.” Sharkie was referring to a controversial claim by the former attorney general Christian Porter that legal advice stated the medevac transfer bill would leave the government without power to return refugees and asylum seekers to offshore detention. The advice, later released under freedom of information, did not contain such a conclusion although the government denied it had mislead about its content. Sharkie said that if the government was genuinely worried about unintended consequences, it could draft its amendments in the Senate. “I am disappointed the government has decided to play politics with an issue that’s so important to so many Australians.” The government’s original position had been to only ban expulsion on the grounds of sexuality – deferring other changes until a review was undertaken by the Australian Law Reform Commission. Jane Hume, the financial services minister, said the government wanted the bill restored to its original form with the ALRC process to investigate the proposed changes to the Sex Discrimination Act “so that we get that balance right”. “The government will inevitably move amendments to try and revert the bill back to the government’s position,” Hume said “When you deal with competing rights, it’s always going to be a contentious issue ... the rights of children, sometimes very vulnerable children, with the rights of people of faith to have the choice to send their children to a same-sex school. “People of faith should be allowed to express their faith to send their children to a same-sex school but at the same time we want to make sure we protect all children, particularly Australia’s most vulnerable.” The Equality Australia chief executive, Anna Brown, said the changes to the Sex Discrimination Act were aimed at protecting students at religious schools who are vulnerable to discrimination, including LGBTQ+ students. “If the government considers that there is a problem, it can bring forward amendments that reflect the will of parliament to remove discrimination,” Brown said. “There are already exceptions in the Sex Discrimination Act dealing with single-sex schools that, for example, allow girls schools to exclude boys, including trans boys. There was nothing passed last night that impacts these exemptions. “These issues would never have arisen if the government had fulfilled its commitment to amend the Sex Discrimination Act to protect LGBTQ+ students.”",News/World news,Coalition shelves religious discrimination bill after Christian lobby says changes do ‘more harm than good’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/10/coalition-shelves-religious-discrimination-bill-after-christian-lobby-says-changes-do-more-harm-than-good
2/10/2022,"The former British spy chief Sir Richard Dearlove has described the Pine Gap surveillance base in central Australia as “hugely important” to western intelligence collection about China’s “rather alarming” activities. Intelligence officials are usually tight-lipped on exactly what the joint US-Australian facility is used for, but the former head of MI6 said Pine Gap was “a sophisticated listening post, all right, and a lot else besides”.  “You’ve got the massive installation, which is partly NSA [US National Security Agency], at Pine Gap and that’s really important because, well, it’s an intercept intelligence site,” Dearlove said on the global affairs podcast One Decision. “And it’s hugely important strategically to the US and to the western alliance because of its position, its geographical location.” He explicitly confirmed the western interest in Beijing’s activities, saying Pine Gap – the installation near Alice Springs in the Northern Territory – was “crucial to, let’s say, western coverage of China”. “I don’t think I should go into detail about what it actually does, that would be indiscreet,” Dearlove added. More broadly, he said, Australia had “a very sophisticated intercept capability”. The former head of the British Secret Intelligence Service made the comments during a podcast conversation with the former Australian foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop, who said Australia’s relationship with China currently was “tense”. Australia is a member of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing alliance, which also includes the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand. The presence of the Pine Gap facility in Australia has from time to time attracted controversy. A trove of NSA documents leaked by Edward Snowden indicated the site “plays a significant role in supporting both intelligence activities and military operations”. The ABC reported in 2017 that the facility – officially known as Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap - provided detailed geolocation intelligence to the US military. That prompted some legal observers to question the site’s potential role in supporting deadly US drone strikes in the Middle East. Bishop said China had been “much more assertive” and “indeed aggressive in some instances” since Xi Jinping became president. Some of China’s wolf warrior diplomacy had been “startling”, Bishop contended, and Beijing had “sought to make an example of us” since 2020 by introducing steep tariffs or trade actions against Australian export sectors such as wine, beef and barley. Bishop said Australia was in the “rather unusual situation that our major trading partner, China, is in serious competition with our major strategic defence and intelligence ally, the United States”. In the podcast interview, Dearlove asked Bishop whether it would be possible to “square this circle” in the long term. Dearlove cited not only the Pine Gap installation but also Australia’s strategic alliance with the US, the rotation of US marines through Darwin, and the Aukus deal for the US and the UK to help Australia acquire at least eight nuclear-powered submarines. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “And all of this is, you could argue, [is] very provocative to the Chinese,” Dearlove said. “And at the same time, your economy or aspects of your economy, are absolutely totally tied to the Chinese market.” Bishop agreed that it was “a balancing act” and called for Australia and China to “reestablish a more constructive dialogue”. “It will be interesting to see how Xi Jinping is able to maintain this grip on power,” she said. “I’ve not yet seen evidence that he’s losing it, but China’s future is facing many hurdles, many challenges. Its inexorable rise is not inevitable. I think there are many bridges to cross before China could be seen as a superpower in the nature of the United States.” Bishop, who was foreign minister from 2013 to 2018, said Australia and other countries in the region were “looking for more US leadership, not less”. She contended that very few countries “would want to live in a region where the Chinese government was calling the shots”. Dearlove called on the west to “develop a new security regime which copes with China’s presence as a superpower”. But while saying he found China’s insistence on rewriting global rules as “rather alarming”, Dearlove also made an emphatic plea for Australia and other western countries to continue to seek dialogue with Beijing. “I do firmly believe in talking, not just to one’s competitors, but to one’s enemies as well, and engaging in dialogue, and having some sort of bilateral infrastructure which allows for the treatment and discussion of problems on an almost constant basis,” he said. The One Decision podcast, which is co-hosted by Dearlove and the journalist Julia Macfarlane, was recorded in December but released on Thursday. It is produced by the US-based communications firm Global Situation Room.",News/Australia news,"Australia’s Pine Gap ‘hugely important’ to western monitoring of China, says former British spy chief",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/10/australias-pine-gap-hugely-important-to-western-monitoring-of-china-says-former-british-spy-chief
2/10/2022,"A valuable avant garde painting has been vandalised by a “bored” security guard who drew eyes on faceless figures in the artwork on his first day working in a Russian gallery. Anna Leporskaya’s Three Figures was painted between 1932 and 1934, and had been insured for 75m roubles (A$1.3m, £740,000). It was on display as part of an abstract art exhibition at the Boris Yeltsin Presidential Center in Ekaterinburg when the guard drew eyes on it using a ballpoint pen.  Alexander Drozdov, the executive director of the Yeltsin Center, did not identify the security guard in a statement, but said he worked for a private security company and had been fired. The exhibition’s curator, Anna Reshetkina, said the painting was vandalised “with a Yeltsin Center-branded pen”.“His motives are still unknown but the administration believes it was some kind of a lapse in sanity,” she said. “The ink has slightly penetrated into the paint layer, since the titanium white used to paint the faces is not covered with author’s varnish, as is often the case in abstract painting of that time,” Ivan Petrov wrote in the Art Newspaper, which broke the story. “Fortunately, the vandal drew with a pen without strong pressure, and therefore the relief of the strokes as a whole was not disturbed. The left figure also had a small crumble of the paint layer up to the underlying layer on the face.” The vandalism was first noticed on 7 December by two visitors who raised the alarm with a gallery employee. The painting was removed from the exhibition and returned to the State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, which had loaned the painting. Restoration experts at the Tretyakov have estimated that the restoration work would cost 250,000 roubles (A$4,600). The Yeltsin Center reported the damage to police on 20 December, but Ekaterinburg’s ministry of internal affairs initially declined to press charges as the damage was deemed “insignificant”. Russian media reported that the ministry of culture later complained to the prosecutor general’s office about the lack of action, and last week police announced that they had opened an investigation. The suspect faces a fine and up to three months in prison. The Yeltsin Center has since installed protective screens over the remaining works in the exhibition. This is not the first time a painting has been vandalised in Russia: in 2019 a man was sentenced to two and half years in prison after attacking a painting of Ivan the Terrible in the Tretyakov, tearing it with a pole from the barrier protecting the work. The same work was also attacked in 1913 by a mentally ill man who slashed it with a knife three times.",Arts/Art and design,Russian painting vandalised by ‘bored’ gallery guard who drew eyes on it,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/10/russian-painting-vandalised-by-bored-gallery-guard-who-drew-eyes-on-it
2/10/2022,"American snowboarder Chloe Kim has become the first woman to successfully defend the Olympic halfpipe title, soaring to an untouchable lead with a gigantic opening run and cruising to a historic repeat gold. Kim, dropping in last among the 12 competitors to qualify for Thursday morning’s final, set the bar with a huge first run which included two 1080s and three spins down the course known as the Secret Garden Olympic Halfpipe, covering her mouth and dropping to her knees in jubilation upon seeing her score of 94.00 announced.  She fell on her subsequent runs while trying to debut the 1260 – three and a half revolutions in the air – but the sheer amplitude for her opening foray was more than enough to secure the gold over Queralt Castellet of Spain, who earned the silver with a score of 90.25, and Sena Tomita of Japan, whose 88.25 was good for bronze. Kim’s resounding win played out before an audience that included her friend Eileen Gu, the freeskier from California who captured the freestyle big air gold on Tuesday competing for China. The two embraced at the bottom of the pipe before Kim headed back up for her final attempt. “I was so proud of myself,” an elated Kim said in the aftermath. “I had the worst practice, ever. I probably landed my run twice when I’m used to landing it eight times, normally, and so that puts you in a weird headspace. It felt so inconsistent. I didn’t want to feel all that pressure of having to land my first safety run (in competition). I overflowed with emotion when I was able to land it on the first go, and it opened up a lot of opportunity for me to go try something new (in her second and third runs).” She added: “I have been in this situation many times. I’ve been competing professionally since I was 13, so that’s almost 10 years now. I reset and reminded myself that it’s just another run. I have a brand new opportunity to go land it, and that calms me down a lot.” Kim, 21, first shot to global stardom four years ago in Pyeongchang, when she became the youngest female athlete to secure Winter Olympics gold on snow with a transcendent performance that included back-to-back 1080s. But she quickly found the trappings of fame – gracing the fronts of cereal boxes and magazine covers, getting name-checked in Frances McDormand’s Oscar speech – were dwarfed by her yearning for a normal life as a college student at Princeton. After nearly two years off the mountain Kim picked up right where she left off with a world title, crediting her decision to start therapy and focus on her mental health with helping rekindle her competitive fire. She’s won every halfpipe event she’s entered since Pyeongchang, which created a sense of suffocating pressure around her Olympic title defense at Zhangjiakou Genting Snow Park, the sparkling new venue nestled in the tree-lined southern foot of Xiaohaituo Mountain. But Kim’s imperious opening run quickly sucked any drama from the competition, turning the affair into a repeat coronation. Kim adds a second Olympic gold to an overflowing trophy case that includes a Youth Olympic title, two world titles, two Crystal Globes, six X Games titles and 10 wins from 14 World Cup starts. More importantly, she will depart Beijing better equipped to manage the resurgence of celebrity that awaits back home. “I am more prepared this time,” Kim said. “Luckily, it was a learning curve since the last time. Now that I’ve grown up a little more and I understand boundaries and I have an amazing therapist, so I think it will make the journey a lot more doable.”",Sport/Sport,Chloe Kim dominates snowboard halfpipe to win second successive Olympic gold,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/09/chloe-kim-womens-snowboard-halfpipe-gold-medal-winter-olympics-2022-beijing
