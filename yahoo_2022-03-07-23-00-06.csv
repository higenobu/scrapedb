3/7/2022,"By Dan Williams JERUSALEM (Reuters) -The Ukrainian envoy to Israel voiced frustration on Monday with its refusal to provide what his country deems defensive aid against Russia, donning a helmet at a news conference and asking rhetorically how such equipment could be regarded as lethal. But Ambassador Yevgen Korniychuk also voiced gratitude for Israel's efforts to mediate between Russia and Ukraine, saying this outweighed any possible military assistance from it. While condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Israel has limited itself to humanitarian relief and kept up contacts with Moscow. Israel coordinates strikes against Iranian deployments in Syria with Russia's military garrison there, and is mindful of the big power's sway over nuclear talks with Tehran. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett held surprise talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday, casting the three-hour meeting as a peacemaking bid at which Iran was discussed too. The Kremlin has not commented. ""Everyone must do everything, everything in their capacity to stop this terrible human tragedy, which no one thought we would see in our lifetimes,"" Bennett said in a TV interview, offering no more details on the Moscow talks. Koriychuk said Bennett had pledged to try to mediate ""even if there is just one percent (chance) of success"". ""This is much more important than, for example, sales of weapons or munitions, et cetera, that we are still fighting (about) with the Israeli government,"" the diplomat said, adding that Kyiv understood Bennett's limitations on the aid issue. Still, Koriychuk noted that Ukraine also had an unmet request for Israeli protective vests and helmets, one of which he stood to place on his head as he spoke. ""Please tell me, how you can kill with this thing? This is simply not possible. So I don't know what these people are afraid of. To provide personal security for Ukrainians ... that's the simplest thing they can do."" Russia has said anyone providing lethal weaponry for Ukraine to use in the fighting ""will bear responsibility"".

3/7/2022,"As spring break gets going this week in South Florida, the National Weather Service has extended the high rip current risk warning for the waters off Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties to 7 p.m. Wednesday. For those of you not exactly sure what that covers, that’s from Homestead Bayfront Park all the way up to Lake Worth Beach, with Crandon, Miami Beach, Haulover, Sunny Isles Beach, Hollywood, Hallandale Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Boca Raton and Palm Beach in between. “Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water,” the weather service reminds swimmers. The rules for dealing with a rip current are simple: ▪ Swim near a lifeguard. Look for red flags telling you where not to swim. ▪ If you’re caught in a rip current, don’t swim against it. Try to swim parallel to the shore until you’re out. ▪ If you can’t swim out of the rip current, relax, float and tread water. The “relax” part is important. This is not a time to get super tense or panic. ▪ If you can’t get out of the current, face the shore and yell and wave for help. May 7 @ 6 AM - Unfortunately it appears that the rip current risk will remain elevated this week along the Atlantic beaches of South Florida. Swim at guarded beaches, follow the instructions from lifeguards, and stay aware of the latest forecast. #flwx pic.twitter.com/LcgivtV8AN — NWS Miami (@NWSMiami) March 7, 2022 How hot is it about to get in Florida?

3/7/2022,"Russia has issued a list of demands for Ukraine to follow if its brutal invasion is to come to an end. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov gave Moscow's most explicit statement so far of the terms it wants to impose on Ukraine to halt what it calls its ""special military operation"", which is now in its 12th day. Pesko said Ukraine must: cease military action change its constitution to enshrine neutrality acknowledge Crimea as Russian territory and, recognise the separatist republics of Donetsk and Lugansk as independent territories. The outlining of Russia’s demands came as delegations from Russia and Ukraine prepared to meet on Monday for a third round of talks. Peskov said that, if those conditions are met, Russia's military action will halt ""in a moment"". He added: ""They should make amendments to the constitution according to which Ukraine would reject any aims to enter any bloc. This is possible only by making changes to the constitution.""

""We really are finishing the demilitarisation of Ukraine. We will finish it. But the main thing is that Ukraine ceases its military action. They should stop their military action and then no one will shoot,"" he said. ""We have also spoken about how they should recognize that Crimea is Russian territory and that they need to recognize that Donetsk and Lugansk are independent states. And that’s it. It will stop in a moment."" It is not yet clear how receptive the Ukrainian government will be to the demands. By changing its constitution to enshrine neutrality, Ukraine would be unable to join Nato - a key move the Kremlin is keen to ensure. Watch: Zelenskyy calls for harsher Russian sanctions Vladimir Putin reportedly thought his invasion would take a matter of days, but was met with a strong resistance from Ukrainian Armed Forces and civilians. On Wednesday, Russia admitted for the first time admitted it had suffered heavy losses, saying in a statement 498 of its troops had died. The UK has the death toll will be “considerably higher” than figures released by the Kremlin. The United Nations has opposed any Russian claim to Donetsk and Lugansk and it has also condemned the annexation of Crime by Moscow in 2014. Russia has increasingly been seen by the international community as a ""global pariah"" following the invasion on 24 February.

The only countries to vote no in support of Moscow were Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea and Syria. Putin's invasion has triggered the worst refugee crisis since World War Two, displacing around 1.5 million people. Ukrainian cities have come under almost constant bombardments, with Ukrainian officials estimating that over 2,000 civilians - including children - have been killed in the violence. Russia agreed to a ceasefire over the weekend so people could be evacuated from their homes. Attempts at an evacuation in Mariupol were stopped on Sunday after men, women, and children were targeted with shells as they tried to flee. International attention has focused on Irpin, a Kyiv suburb where residents have been scrambling across a river to flee Russian bombardment.
