1/12/2022,"Longtime Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre’s sexual abuse lawsuit against him can move forward, as a New York judge rejected the royal’s efforts to dismiss her civil claim on Wednesday. Giuffre, who has alleged that the late financier Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell sexually abused her, said they forced her into sex with the Duke of York at age 17. She filed suit against the royal on 9 August, citing battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Prince Andrew’s legal team had argued in court papers and proceedings that Giuffre’s 2009 settlement with Epstein shielded him from her lawsuit. The settlement, which was unsealed on 3 January, awarded Giuffre $500,000. Their agreement contained a provision that stated: “Second parties and any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant … from all, and all manner of, action and actions of Virginia [Giuffre], including state or federal, cause and causes of action.” Andrew was not mentioned by name in this settlement. Kaplan’s decision deals yet another blow to the embattled British prince, whose reputation and standing within the royal family has been saddled by his ties to Epstein and Maxwell. High-profile criminal proceedings against Epstein and Maxwell over the past two years have further damaged his reputation. Maxwell, the daughter of the late British press titan Robert Maxwell, was found guilty of five counts for luring girls as young as 14 into Epstein’s world for him to sexually abuse. Epstein, a convicted sex offender who in addition to Prince Andrew, counted former presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump in his circle, killed himself in a Manhattan jail about a month after his July 2019 arrest on sex trafficking charges. Giuffre has claimed that Prince was “sweating profusely all over me” at a London nightclub on a night when they allegedly had a sexual encounter. Prince Andrew said in a disastrous BBC interview that Giuffre’s statement about his perspiration could not be true, claiming: “I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don’t sweat or I didn’t sweat at the time.” Prince Andrew also maintained that on the evening cited by Giuffre, he went with his daughter, Beatrice, to a late-afternoon children’s party at a Pizza Express in Woking. After the party, Prince Andrew claims, he was at home with his children all night. As part of Giuffre’s suit, her legal team has requested documents that would prove whether or not Prince Andrew can sweat.

1/12/2022,"Few people have got through the past 20 months or so without having to make sacrifices. Horizons have narrowed and savings have shrunk. But for low-income households simply trying to keep food on the table, and with no reserves to draw on, the effects of the pandemic have been felt much more keenly. To blame the pandemic for this situation, however, is to misunderstand the systemic pressures that trap people in the cycle of poverty. The number of people experiencing destitution in the UK had already risen by 54% between 2017 and 2019.  Rich country, poor peopleShouldn’t an affluent country such as the UK – the world’s fifth-richest, according to the World Bank – have fewer people scrabbling around for the essentials? In terms of GDP per capita, when compared with neighbouring France, the UK is almost £1,000 better off per person – and yet the poverty rates of these two countries are quite different: according to the World Bank 18.6% for the UK’s population (in 2017), versus 13.6% of the French population (in 2018). Wealth only tells part of the story; how that wealth is distributed is key. Centre for Health Economics at the University of York Sadly, successive UK governments have been wearing their heartlessness on their sleeves since the days of austerity, when then-chancellor George Osborne chose to seek to balance the country’s books, rather than help individuals and families in poverty. The cuts announced in his June 2010 budget nibbled away at an already stretched-thin society, and have been linked to at least 50,000 unnecessary deaths over the term of the first Cameron government. The Trussell Trust Food for familiesAnd so it fell to charities and organisations working outside government to pick up the slack. In 2011-12, food banks in the Trussell Trust’s network distributed almost 130,000 food parcels; by 2020 that had increased to more than 2.5m food parcels being distributed via 1,300 food banks in its network. The biggest year-on-year increases as a percentage were between 2012 and 2014 – when the accumulative squeeze of austerity was biting. However, the absolute increase in parcels from 2019-20 to 2020-21 is the largest ever increase and is notable for the Trussell Trust network being far more stable (and so not so driven by increases in the size and scale of the network). As Margaret Sena, CEO of Cambridge City Food Bank points out, not all food parcels are created equal: “We have standard boxes, we have family boxes, and then we have bonus boxes, for particularly large families.” It’s worth noting that when a household of four goes away from a food bank, the Trussell Trust reports that as four food parcels. Not all of those parcels go to people stuck in a long-term cycle of poverty. A third of people referred to food banks in early 2020 had only recently found themselves in difficulty. Impact on familiesIn mid-2020, 84% of people referred to food banks in the Trussell Trust network were people aged 25-54, versus 77% in early 2020. This increase points to a group of income earners whose working hours or employment status took a hit during the pandemic, as well as the likelihood of them being parents dealing with school and nursery closures. The Trussell Trust, State of Hunger report Although only one in seven families in the general population have three or more children, nearly two in five (39%) of people referred to food banks have larger families, up from 36% in 2018. The imposition of a “two-child limit” on universal credit and child tax credit in 2017, which stripped those families of at least £53 a week – or £2,780 a year, including the tax credits – may well bear some of the blame for this increase. For context, the amount mothers in Germany receive for each subsequent child grows with the size of family: they get €219 (£186) for the first and second child, €225 for the third, and €250 for the fourth and all further children (until they’re 18) – on top of being paid at 65% of their wage for more than a year of maternity leave and paying nothing for nurseries. The Trussell Trust, State of Hunger report Crutches and cutsThe government introduced a £20 boost to universal credit in April 2020 for everyone claiming the benefit. In early 2020, 95% of people referred to food banks in the Trussell Trust network met the definition of being destitute. This didn’t stop at least one MP saying many of those in receipt of the extra £20 “don’t really need it” even as he defended MPs with second jobs for being “people who have families [to take care of].” Positive changes that have come in since to the universal credit taper rate, “give something back to people”, says Emma Revie, chief executive of the Trussell Trust, “but don’t cover the remainder who find themselves unable to work at the moment, for many, many reasons”. Mental health: the other pandemicCertainly, one of the more extreme trends witnessed as a result of Covid was the growth in households that used food banks reporting mental health problems, up from an already high 51% in early 2020 to 72% in mid-2020. The Trussell Trust, State of Hunger report Despite being a wealthy country, the reality of living in the UK is, for many, grim and getting grimmer. If the true measure of a society is how it treats those in need, the UK must be languishing well towards the bottom of the leaderboard. The system seems hell bent on propelling more towards destitution, rather than supporting struggling people to feed themselves, make ends meet and inch their way out of poverty.",The last 10 years of food banks,Why we need food banks – and why we shouldn’t: 10 years of The Trussell Trust,https://www.theguardian.com/the-last-10-years-of-food-banks/2022/jan/12/why-we-need-food-banks-and-why-we-shouldnt-10-years-of-the-trussell-trust
1/12/2022,"A decade ago food banks in the Trussell Trust network provided 60,000 emergency food parcels a year in the UK – in 2020-21 food banks in its network handed out 2.5m. The figures show not only how much the charity’s network of food banks has stepped in to fill the gaps in support provided by social security, but also how its national network of food banks have become a fixed feature of welfare support. Today there is a real danger that food aid supplied by organisations such as the Trussell Trust will become the accepted norm. And that, according to the charity, is simply wrong.  “We will continue to provide compassion, and be there as long as we are needed, but it’s not right to provide that level of mass distribution of food aid in the fifth richest country in the world,” says Emma Revie, chief executive of the Trussell Trust. “We have to advocate for change.” The Trussell Trust’s advocacy and campaigning work has grown as its food bank staff and volunteers have continued to witness more and more people in poverty without enough money to feed themselves and their families. “We can’t keep quiet when we hear stories about people coming to the food bank day after day and knowing that something could be changed to prevent that happening,” says Revie. “We have got to advocate for what we are seeing on behalf of, and with, the people coming to our food banks and to call for the changes that we know can happen.” The Trussell Trust’s vision, which is at the heart of its campaigning, is to have a UK where food banks no longer exist, as outlined in its strategic plan. And it is an ambition shared by the majority of the British public. In 2019 a Trussell Trust poll created with YouGov showed that nine in 10 Britons thought people should be able to afford to buy enough food. Seven in 10 surveyed also agreed that food banks should not exist in a modern society, while 51% went a step further and said they were an “embarrassment” to the country. But in order to achieve its vision the charity has to spread its campaigning net wide – looking at what drives people into destitution in the first place. And, crucially, it has to get the message out that income, rather than lack of food, is the root cause of need for food banks. With 1,300 food bank centres across the country in its network, the charity is ideally placed to gather evidence to identify what is behind that need and what needs to change. “We have the data on the number of people who come to food banks and why they come,” says Revie. “Once you know what is driving food bank use you have a responsibility to share that information with the people who can do something about it.” The Trussell Trust counts the hundreds of millions of pounds from the UK government for local councils to tackle hardship among its recent campaign achievements. The Trussell Trust has also been raising awareness about the inadequacy of the social security system and, as part of its Keep the Lifeline campaign, it highlighted that about 900,000 people were very likely to turn to a food bank because of the UK government’s decision to abolish the temporary universal credit (UC) uplift of £20 a week, introduced at the start of the Covid pandemic in April 2020. The campaign follows the #5weekstoolong campaign, which calls for an end to the five-week wait before a claimant can receive their first UC payment. The charity is continuing to monitor the impact of the £20 cut and fight for its reinstatement. “We are committed to continue to tell the stories of those people who have been so badly hit by the cut,” says Jo Cooke, director of public engagement at the Trussell Trust. “I would struggle to call [the changes to the taper] a success in terms of our campaign, as there are still people who will be in need. It’s a concession, but all of these things are important even if small moves,” she says. “Some families will now get to keep some of their earnings – it’s going to make a permanent difference.” The charity believes it was also instrumental in the decision of the Scottish government to develop a strategy to end the need for food banks – a commitment that followed the recent Holyrood elections. “We hosted two hustings in Glasgow during the election campaign and challenged each of the parties to commit to putting in place a plan to end food banks within the first 12 months of the new parliament,” says Revie. “Each party made that pledge and the government has come through on that pledge and is working on a plan.” The trust also puts its name to broader campaigns that highlight the link between the need for food banks and income such as A menu for Change and Lift the Ban – a coalition of 250 organisations spearheaded by Refugee Action, which calls for people seeking asylum in the UK to have the right to work while they wait for a decision on their status. “We aren’t experts in everything and there are a broad spectrum of organisations that want to work together to create coalitions or alliances where we can pool our resources and work collaboratively to get things happening,” says Cooke. Although Revie is worried that the UK is on the brink of “normalising” food aid, she is optimistic that the Trussell Trust’s campaigning and advocacy work, harnessed with the power of the public, can bring an end to food banks in the UK. “We have tremendous power as members of our society if we come together and speak with one voice about what it is we want for ourselves, for our families and for our communities,” she says. “We can bring about change, we just have to believe things can change. Policies are made by people and policies can be done and be changed and made anew – we just have to ask for it.”",The last 10 years of food banks,Nine in 10 Britons think hunger in the UK is a problem – so why is so little being done to solve it?,https://www.theguardian.com/the-last-10-years-of-food-banks/2022/jan/12/nine-in-10-britons-think-hunger-in-the-uk-is-a-problem-so-why-is-so-little-being-done-to-solve-it
1/12/2022,"Jürgen Klopp has claimed he has no concerns over Mohamed Salah’s contract stand-off with Liverpool because both parties see his long-term future at Anfield and have held “good conversations” over a new deal. Liverpool’s leading goalscorer has entered the final 18 months of his contract and, in an interview with the latest edition of British GQ, reiterated that a successful outcome to protracted talks over an extension rests with the club’s owner, Fenway Sports Group.  Negotiations between FSG and Salah’s representative, Ramy Abbas Issa, started before this season but, despite the absence of an agreement on what would be the most lucrative deal in the club’s history, Klopp remains confident Salah will stay. “There was nothing in it that would be unexpected,” the Liverpool manager said of the GQ interview. “We know, I know, that Mo wants to stay. We want him to stay. That’s the point where we are. These things take time. I can’t change that, sorry! But I think it is all in a good place. “I am very positive about it. I’m pretty sure the fans are not as nervous as you [the media] are. They know the club, know the people here who are dealing with things, so there are, I think, enough reasons for being pretty positive. As long as it’s not done, we cannot say anything about it. ‘Good conversations’ – that’s what I could say.” Salah has said repeatedly that he wishes to prolong his career at Anfield. With Liverpool wanting the same thing, Klopp was asked, why the delay? “These things take time,” he replied. “There are so many things you have to do, and by the way there is a third party: the agent is there as well. But there’s nothing to worry about – it’s a normal process. Mo has a contact here this season and next season. Nobody has to worry, it’s just the situation. All fine, not done, but we had talks. He’s a world-class player, unbelievable player, did a lot of great stuff for Liverpool. Of course we want to keep him, and let’s see how it will work out.” Salah turns 30 in June and his age has been cited as a possible reason for FSG’s reluctance to meet the player’s demands. But Klopp, who has been involved in the discussions, has championed the Egypt international’s ability to emulate Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in sustaining world-class levels into his mid-30s. “I think so,” he said. “It’s his character, his determination, the way he trains, his attitude, work rate. It’s incredible. First in, last out, doing the right stuff. You can do some not-so-good things when you spend so long in the gym and the training ground, but he knows his body and he knows what to do. He listens to the experts here and tries to improve all the time. He worked so hard to be in the situation he is in now and he will not waste it by doing less. I am as convinced as you can be.”",Sport/Football,Klopp reveals ‘good conversations’ over new Salah contract at Liverpool,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/12/jurgen-klopp-mohamed-salah-new-liverpool-contract-good-conversations-positive
1/12/2022,"A British-Iranian dual national who worked for the British Council has been freed from detention in Evin prison and returned to the UK after being acquitted of spying charges. Aras Amiri’s lawyers had mounted an appeal to the Iranian supreme court that led to her release. She is now at an undisclosed address in the UK.  The 34-year-old, who worked as an artistic affairs officer for the British Council, was visiting relatives in Tehran in 2018 when she was detained. In May 2019 she was sentenced to 10 years in prison on spying charges after she said she refused to become an informant for Iran’s intelligence service. Three months later she lost an appeal. “We have always refuted [sic] the original charges made against Aras,” the British Council said on Wednesday. “We are very proud of her work in our London office as an arts programme officer supporting a greater understanding and appreciation of Iranian culture in the UK. This was important work, which reflects the value of cross-border cultural collaboration. Aras’s wellbeing remains our priority. We ask that her privacy is respected as she rebuilds her life in the UK following a long and difficult period.” In 2019 Amiri wrote to the then-chief justice and now president-elect, Ebrahim Raisi, asking him to conduct an investigation into the false charges against her. She said the reason she had been imprisoned was her refusal to spy for the Iranian intelligence services. “Following my release on bail … the case investigators kept contacting me,” she wrote. “During our third meeting, I turned down their explicit invitation for cooperation and told them I could only work in my specific field, not any other kind of work. “In light of the unlawful actions in the processing of my case and the insults against myself and my family, I am writing to request Your Excellency to carry out an investigation,” Amiri wrote. The letter was translated by the Centre for Human Rights in Iran. A number of British-Iranian nationals have been jailed in Iran on similar charges, including Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was sentenced to an additional year in prison in April 2021, shortly before finishing her five-year sentence. During Amiri’s imprisonment she shared a cell with many other dual nationals. Talks about the future of the Iran nuclear deal, seen as critical to wider European-Iranian relations, are continuing in Vienna, and some relatives of those still detained are hoping that Amiri’s release is a sign of a slow thaw over the issue of detainees.",News/World news,Aras Amiri: Iran frees UK-Iranian woman accused of spying,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/aras-amiri-iran-frees-uk-iranian-woman-accused-of-spying
1/12/2022,"The price of goods and services in the US continue to rise at rates unseen in decades, jumping 7% in December compared to the same month last year – the seventh consecutive month in which inflation has topped 5%.  The news represents a blow to the Biden administration and the Federal Reserve, which until recently have characterized soaring prices as a “transitory” phenomenon brought about by supply chain issues triggered by the pandemic. On Wednesday, the labor department said the consumer price index (CPI) – which measures what consumers pay for a wide range of goods – rose 0.5% last month compared with November and 7% compared with December 2020. Price increases in housing and used cars and trucks were the largest contributors to the inflation rate, with 0.4% and 3.5% increases in price compared with November, respectively. Food prices also continued to increase, though the 0.5% jump in prices is not as high as increases seen in previous months. Disruptions to the global supply chain caused by the pandemic are still causing shortages and driving up the price of goods, from cars to meat and furniture. In November the average price of a used vehicle in the US was $29,011 – 39% more than just 12 months earlier. The Federal Reserve is now preparing to raise interest rates to curb inflation and has indicated that it may raise rates three times in 2022, perhaps beginning as early as March. The Fed has stopped calling inflation “transitory” and on Tuesday, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, told Congress that it was time for the central bank to move away from emergency pandemic measures. “What we have now is a mismatch between demand and supply. We have a very strong demand in areas where supply is constrained,” Powell said. “If we see inflation persisting at high levels longer than expected [and] we have to raise interest rates more over time, we will.” At a White House press briefing on Tuesday, press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the administration was expecting elevated figures on Wednesday and that it expects month-over-month inflation to be “moderate” in coming months, though forecasters are expecting inflation to head toward more typical figures by the end of the year. Psaki said the historic price increases emphasize the need for Congress to pass Biden’s climate and social safety net bill, which has hit an impasse. “We continue to press for steps in working with Congress to … lower costs for the American people,” Psaki said. “That’s why we want to get Build Back Better done.”",News/Business,US inflation jumped 7% in December as prices rise at rates unseen in decades,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/12/us-inflation-rate-december-2021
1/12/2022,"A rush to buy £1m-plus homes in the countryside in the Covid-inspired “race for space” and the warehouse boom at the end of last year have helped the high-end estate agent Savills to significantly upgrade its profit forecasts. In further evidence that the UK property market is flourishing, the estate agent Winkworth also released figures on Wednesday lifting its profit outlook.  Savills, which handles commercial and residential property deals around the world, said the past nine weeks had been “extraordinarily strong”, particularly in the UK and Asia Pacific. Continental Europe and the Middle East, and North America also improved, more than eliminating the losses of 2020. The London-based company said a continued exodus of people from cities to buy country houses during the pandemic had boosted its UK business, while the prime central London market also clearly began to improve. Most of the buyers are British, while international buyers tend to be domiciled in the UK. Other property agencies have reported a return of overseas investors, particularly from Hong Kong. Savills said: “Currently there is a definite shortage of sale stock, so despite outperformance in 2021, our expectation of a moderation of activity in 2022 remains intact.” Logistics and retail warehouses in Britain also experienced significant volume increases year-on-year as a surge in online shopping sparked by the pandemic led to booming demand for warehouse space. However, office leasing remained weak and below historic averages in the majority of markets, Savills said. Demand for office space has largely dried up as many companies, including London banks and insurers, have scaled back their offices, asking staff to work from home because of the pandemic, as per government guidance, for example in the UK. Savills expects underlying profit before tax for 2021 to be “very significantly” ahead of the top end of its previous range of forecasts. The estate agent’s expectations for the current year are unchanged, as rising inflation in many markets is pushing wages to the highest rate for many years. The firm expects commercial deals to normalise and activity in some residential markets, particularly in the UK, to slow. The property analyst Anthony Codling said: “The housing market made hay during lockdown, but the opening up of the economy and relaxing of travel restrictions this year is likely to lead to more normal patterns of activity … therefore, this year hay make be taken out rather than put in Savills barns.” Winkworth, a franchisor of real estate agencies focused on London, said its 2021 revenues had been better than expected and it would beat the broker Shore Capital’s forecast of annual pre-tax profit of £2.8bn. Sales agreed were 13% higher than in 2020 and 42% above those of 2019, and the rental market, which makes up half its business, was also strong. Dominic Agace, the Winkworth chief executive, said: “We are conscious of the rising interest rate environment, but the cost of finance remains at a record low and we believe that there is still pent up desire from households to relocate. “Buyer demand over the end of year break has been reported at record levels and sellers finally seem to be returning to the market. While this may hold back the solid growth in prices of the last two years, it bodes well for the number of transactions and we expect another busy year.” Vistry Group, the housebuilder formerly known as Bovis, also had a bumper year and expects to have made an adjusted profit before tax of £345m, up from £144m in 2020. It built nearly 2,000 more homes last year than in 2020, the first year of the pandemic, with completions rising 41% to 6,551.",News/Business,Savills buoyed by surge in sales of £1m-plus homes in countryside,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/12/savills-saleshomes-countryside-estate-agent-covid-race-space-profit-forecasts-warehouse-boom
1/12/2022,"Grace Mirabella’s 17 years as editor of American Vogue, the core publication of Condé Nast’s magazine empire at its most expansive, are usually evaluated as a successful business intervention. She took the magazine from a circulation falling towards 400,000 in 1971 to rising above a million and half in 1988. Fleeing advertisers returned with such big budgets that her hefty September issues required the US Post Office to make special delivery arrangements. But Mirabella’s lasting value to fashion was her belief that the US had its own style of glamour, and that its major creators deserved international acclaim for what a Mirabella favourite, Bill Blass, called “a certain nonchalance”.  She had seen as a wartime teen how good women looked when dressed for hard work, and wrote that she arrived on Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, in the early 1950s at the same time as sportswear; by the end of her Vogue tenure, US ready-to-wear, much of it based on that sportswear tradition, was part of the global uniform, and American brands had opened stores in Paris, London, Milan and Tokyo. In the royal court-like atmosphere of the leading glossy, the ascent of Mirabella, who has died aged 92, had been unlikely. She was not journalistically ambitious, having been forwarded from an entry-level position at Saks Fifth Avenue to Vogue to check the “must list” of merchandise sent by advertisers to be included in editorial shots. She briefly escaped to fashion PR in Rome, but Vogue drew her back, though to limited advancement; she wrote the shopping column threaded through the opening pages, edited sportswear, and was looking for a job elsewhere when Diana Vreeland, who arrived as editor in 1963, clomped down the corridor and invited Mirabella to be her personal assistant. Mirabella had a schoolgirl crush on Vreeland and was for eight years the practical operative behind her boss’s fantastical features by, for and about the rarefied world of the Beautiful People; she did all the menial tasks, down to trying on accessories for Vreeland to inspect. Despite her devotion, Mirabella did not share Vreeland’s view of fashion as performance art for the very few, preferring easygoing clothes for the many. Her other mentor, Alexander Liberman, editorial director of Condé Nast, commended her to the company’s chairman Si Newhouse, who needed Vogue for its secure revenue (from ads and newsstand sales more than subscriptions) and a solid identity so that he could extend into new publications. Vreeland’s pzazz supplied neither, and in 1971 Newhouse deposed her abruptly. Mirabella was on a fashion shoot a continent away when the phone call appointing her to editor-in-chief came. Most Vogue staffers were amenable to Mirabella’s democratisation project, but there was hostility outside the company, accusations that Newhouse was taking the magazine middle-class, that Mirabella was an unconnected nobody from Newark, New Jersey, who had soon redecorated Vreeland’s red lacquer shrine of an office in neutrals. She had never hidden that she was the daughter of a Cuban-rum salesman and gambler, Anthony Mirabella, and a migrant from Italy, Florence (nee Belfatto); she first began working while at high school to help pay her father’s debts, and was proud of her degree in economics from Skidmore College. However, Mirabella’s magazine agenda of wearable American clothes, shown on healthy models, including, at last, black women on the cover, and her introduction of sections on health, fitness and cosmetics, and skincare from laboratories rather than magical cauldrons, happened to be fashionable. The campaign against smoking that she began after her marriage in 1974 to the surgeon William Cahan, who specialised in lung cancer, was confined by the ad department to occasional issues that did not have ads from tobacco clients. But modes always move on. The publisher Hachette launched a US version of Elle magazine in 1985, with young fashion mixed with other features for the MTV generation, and Newhouse envied its big initial success. In actual fashion, there was a revival in extravagant haute couture, with celebrities to flaunt it. Newhouse wanted that, too. “My favourite subject is women and theirs is glitz,” Mirabella shrugged. When she complained to Liberman that she was still shut out of the business side of publishing where the real decisions were taken, he told her: “Women are cheap labour and always will be.” He had a new protégé, Anna Wintour, brought in as creative director. On 28 June 1988 Mirabella heard third-hand about an announcement on a television programme that reported Wintour was replacing her. That was the way in Condé Nast, and in retrospect she merely said: “Name the editors who weren’t fired like that.” Within two days, Rupert Murdoch and his News Corporation had offered her a magazine to command, under her own name. Mirabella, aimed at over-30s, launched well but its fashion-plus-features formula had already been pre-empted by the more youthful Elle. Readers, then ads, waned; corporate suits pushed the disheartened Mirabella out of decision-making and she left in 1996. In her payback memoir, In and Out of Vogue (1995), she wrote of Newhouse and Liberman: “They are in the communications business but they don’t know how to communicate,” but she confessed herself that she had never spoken again with the revered Vreeland after her fall from power. Cahan died in 2001. Mirabella’s two stepsons, Anthony and Christopher, survive her.
