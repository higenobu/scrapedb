1/11/2022,"Dr. Ben Carson, who previously claimed that asymptomatic people shouldn’t be tested for Covid even though they can still spread the virus, appeared on Fox News on Monday to take his absurd testing stance a step further. “It’s quite clear the tests are not going to arrive in time,” he said of the White House working to make sure more tests are available. “But maybe that’s not such a bad thing, because the more tests you have the more positive people you’re going to have.” More from Rolling Stone 'Abhorent': Disability Advocates Slam CDC Director for Comments on 'Encouraging' Covid Deaths Novak Djokovic Released From Detention After Judge Overturns Visa Cancellation AOC Latest to Join Growing List of Lawmakers Testing Positive for Covid Once again, this man is a doctor. “If you don’t have a good plan on what to do with those positive people, it just adds more to the confusion,” Carson, a neurosurgeon, continued. “Are we going to be afraid of [the Omicron variant], or are we going to hunker down and hide from it, or use the knowledge that we have in order to live effectively with it?” he added Carson then said the country should be “focusing on therapeutics,” which are currently in short supply thanks to unprecedented case numbers across the country. Also in short supply are health care providers as doctors and nurses experience burnout, mental health issues, and catch Covid themselves. And we still haven’t reached Omicron’s predicted peak. Anchor Martha MacCallum gave Carson an opportunity to clarify his remarks about testing because, yikes! “We need to be more measured in who we’re testing,” Carson said. “To just go out widely and test everybody when you have a virus that is spreading this fast and you don’t have a plan to deal with it, all you’re doing is adding to the confusion.” But, he conceded, we should test people who “have high risk” or who interact with “people who have high risk.” “Let’s not be just indiscriminately testing people and then throwing up our hands when we have so many people who are positive and not knowing what to do with them,” Carson concluded. Carson’s comments are part of a narrative embraced by Fox News, Donald Trump (who infamously ordered staff to “slow the testing down”), and anti-vax conservatives who are willing to sacrifice American lives on the altar of the economy. “Go to work,” and “live with Covid,” Fox & Friends anchors told viewers last week while broadcasting from separate studios instead of their usual couch, part of the network’s policies to… prevent the spread of Covid. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) even suggested on Fox News last week Omicron is good, calling it “nature’s vaccine.” Network favorite and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis downplayed the need for testing last week. “Now think about it,” he said. “Before Covid did anyone go out and seek testing to determine if they were sick? It’s usually you feel like you’re sick and you get tested to determine what you maybe have come down with.” ""Think about it. Before COVID, did anyone go out and seek testing to determine if they were sick?"" @GovRonDeSantis today pic.twitter.com/uPQFwQRJwN — Christina Pushaw 🐊 (@ChristinaPushaw) January 7, 2022 Of course, it’s a ridiculous argument. Cancer screenings and STI screenings, just to name a couple of examples, are often performed when people feel perfectly fine. Anti-science messaging like what’s being broadcast on Fox News and across right-wing America are dangerous and only serve to undermine recommendations from experts, especially doctors who, unlike Carson, specialize in infectious disease and epidemiology.

1/11/2022,"For more than 60 years, the high-flying U-2 has gathered intelligence on hotspots all over the world. In that time, however, only one active-duty pilot has surpassed 3,000 flying hours in the vaunted Dragon Lady. Here's what it takes to hit that milestone, according to the pilot who did it. When US Air Force pilot Lt. Col. ""Jethro"" first learned about the U-2, he was determined to get into the highly selective training program. Piloting the vaunted ""Dragon Lady"" meant flying ""single-seat, high-altitude, wearing the space suit, alone, unarmed, and unafraid, many miles from your homebase,"" he told Insider. Lt. Col. ""Jethro"" — his call sign, an alias used for security — went on to complete the training program and land his dream job piloting the U-2. It's a distinction that just 1,079 people have earned. Following 10 deployments between 2007 and 2018, Jethro became an instructor pilot with the 1st Reconnaissance Squadron, which is responsible for training all U-2 pilots. Today, he trains the newest cadre of U-2 aviators at Beale Air Force Base in California, putting them through the same rigorous program he completed 15 years ago. In September, Jethro became the second pilot in history to reach 3,000 hours piloting the U-2 — and the first to do it while on active duty. He told Insider about his milestone flight and what it has been like to spend the equivalent of 125 days flying the U-2. The jet frequently flies at about 70,000 feet, which offers a unique view of the curve of the earth. ""It's weird because your eyes are so used to seeing the horizon being flat that you kind of have to step back and look at it to go, 'Hey, it is curved,'"" he says. ""It's absolutely beautiful. It never gets old."" But 70,000 feet is also above Armstrong's Line, where water boils at body temperature and life is not sustainable, which requires not only a pressurized cockpit but also a bulky full-pressure suit similar to what astronauts use on shuttle missions. Suiting up to fly in the Lockheed U-2 is about as close as a pilot can come to suiting up for a mission to space. But a suit that keeps you alive at zero pressure — and allows men and women pilots to urinate mid-flight — isn't easy to get into. For that, Jethro and other U-2 pilots have dedicated technicians from the Physiological Support Squadron. The technicians care for the flight suits with the same attention aircraft maintainers give their aircraft. Watching new U-2 trainees work with the Physiological Support technicians to get in and out of the suit can be awkward and comical. ""It's a dance, and the first time you do it you have no idea how that dance works,"" says Jethro. Once he's suited up, he gets moved to a big reclining chair and hooked up to oxygen and cooling air. It can be hot and tight in the inflated suit. Walking up the ladder into the aircraft and getting seated is yet another dance, as U-2 pilots can't strap themselves into the cockpit while wearing the suit and again need the technicians' help. The technicians also handle the pilots' food orders and preferred Gatorade color pre-takeoff. Their in-flight meals are pureed and come in a metal toothpaste-style tube for ease of use. ""We do a high-protein, low-residue diet,"" Jethro said. ""You don't want to be gassy up there. As the pressure goes down, gas expands, so it can lead to you being uncomfortable in the jet."" The United States has been using the U-2 for more than a half-century, flying intelligence-gathering missions over the Soviet Union, Vietnam, China, and Cuba during the Cold War. In recent years, it has conducted missions over Iraq and Afghanistan. It's designed to fly at all hours and in all weather. The U-2 has received technical upgrades, but the basic cockpit hasn't changed much in the past 40 years. Having iPads and state-of-the-art navigation technology replace paper charts and maps is probably the biggest difference since Jethro's early days. Before that technical upgrade, ""You were lucky if you knew where you were,"" he says. The East Texas native joined ROTC in college to pursue his childhood dream of being a pilot. He started training two months after September 11, 2001, had his first solo flight in 2002, and was on track to fly a larger aircraft, like the C-135 Stratolifter. When he graduated from pilot training, he still wasn't sure exactly what he wanted to fly. His squadron commander and mentor, who was a U-2 pilot, suggested the U-2. From there, Jethro did a Google search for the U-2 pilot application and began the arduous training and selection process. The training program is selective. Candidates who make it through a two-week interview move on to training in a T-38 Talon, a two-seat supersonic jet trainer. After that, remaining candidates move onto training in an actual U-2, learning to fly, land, and do emergency procedures. Students' seventh flight is their first time solo in an U-2. That's followed by high-altitude training with the space suit, Jethro said. After 14 flights, pilots go through an evaluation. Passing that means you're qualified on the U-2, and ""then we send you over to mission qual[ification] — another syllabus where now that you know how to fly it, you know how to defeat threats,"" he added. ""When you're done with that, you are [a] qualified pilot ready to go on the road."" In 2007, as a newly qualified U-2 pilot, Jethro was deployed for the first time. Stationed at Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, he flew missions over Iraq and Afghanistan. Flying in the desert, he racked up his first 1,000 hours within three years. Some of those missions involved talking to assets on the ground and making decisions while flying over unforgiving terrain far from home, out of radio range of base. He recalls one mission on a cloudy day over Afghanistan in August 2007, when two separate helicopters crashed roughly 100 miles from each other. He started talking to the downed pilots and joined the effort to pick them up, coordinating with an F-15 to keep the enemy away. The U-2 is a challenging plane to fly and even harder to land. The plane's 105-foot wingspan is perfect for flying high but ungainly closer to the ground. The U-2 has also been stripped down in order to fly at high altitudes for extended periods — its bicycle-style landing gear is supplemented by wing-mounted wheels that detach during takeoff. The pilot's position in the cockpit also makes it harder to see the runway on approach. Those factors mean it takes a lot of physical exertion from the pilot to land, as well as the coordination of an entire team to get the aircraft onto the ground. Another U-2 pilot in a chase car gives directions over the radio as the returning pilot approaches the runway. Once the plane comes to a stop, now without its wing-mounted wheels, it tilts to one side. When Jethro landed at Beale to conclude a routine proficiency flight on September 29, he'd hit 3,000 hours. He would have settled for a low-key post-flight beer to celebrate the milestone. But his squadron made a show of it, coming out to his airplane and cheering. Also there to congratulate him were his wife and kids, fellow U-2 instructor pilot Cory Bartholomew, and the base's wing commander, who'd also been on Jethro's very first deployment. They presented him with a bottle of champagne and, in keeping with tradition, challenged him to launch the cork on to the top of the hangar while keeping one foot on the ground and the other on the ladder up to the parked aircraft's cockpit. ""I'm awful at that part,"" he says. ""I haven't hit the hangar yet.""

1/11/2022,"A man with no permanent address who lived with families or on a bus while he built motocross tracks and mentored kids about the sport is now accused of child rape. Ryan Andrew Meyung was arrested in December and charged with three counts of child rape and two counts of aggravated kidnapping, the Hamilton County District Attorney’s Office in Tennessee said in a Jan. 10 news release. Hamilton County, home to Chattanooga, is in east Tennessee on the borders of North Carolina and Georgia. Meyung’s arrest was published in the local news, prompting several people from other states to come forward with similar allegations, the DA’s office said. Investigators now believe there could be victims in as many as 10 states. Meyung ran a business in Indiana called “Live Your Dreams MX” in which he traveled across the U.S. and in other countries building motocross tracks as well as mentoring children about the sport of motocross, Hamilton County District Attorney General Neal Pinkston said in the news release. Haspin Acres Off-Road & Motocross Park in Laurel, Indiana, lists Meyung as its race manager. The track acknowledged his arrest in a Facebook post on Dec. 19. “The future of motocross racing at Haspin Acres is now uncertain,” the track said. “As many of you know, our MX Race Manager, Ryan Meyung, has been arrested in Tennessee and is awaiting his day in court. All plans for motocross racing at Haspin Acres next season are indefinitely suspended.” Meyung also maintains a public Facebook page that identifies himself as a pro rider, professional motocross monster truck and supercross track builder, motocross trainer and race coordinator. Prior to operating “Live Your Dreams MX,” officials said, Meyung traveled frequently while working with “several youth-oriented organizations and youth ministries.” He also worked at various points as a product delivery driver for a company in Hamilton County. “Meyung has no known permanent address,” the DA’s office said. “He has resided with local families in areas where he builds motocross tracks and performs motocross camps for children or lives out of a bus he co-owned with another unnamed individual.” Police in Chattanooga and the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office partnered with Homeland Security Investigations to conduct a broader investigation into Meyung. They now believe there may be victims in as many as 10 states — including Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Tennessee. The DA’s office said investigators are beginning in states where people have reached out to law enforcement about “potential criminal law violations regarding Meyung and other children.” Meyung is currently being held at the Hamilton County jail.
