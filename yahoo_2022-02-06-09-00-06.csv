2/6/2022,"The GoFundMe website has reversed course and decided to automatically refund donations to the truckers organization leading a protest against Canadian pandemic restrictions. That’s after politicians vowed to investigate the website’s original plans for dealing with donations to the truckers. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said Saturday morning that he and the state’s attorney general will investigate GoFundMe after it shut down a fundraiser for the Canadian truckers participating in the so-called “Freedom Convoy.” More from Deadline GoFundMe Website Lifts Ban On Rittenhouse Fundraisers After Acquittal Bao Nguyen, Ken Jeong, Olivia Munn & Others Team With GoFundMe For Short Film Targeting Asian Hate '60 Second Docs' And GoFundMe Team On Series Telling Stories From Crowdfunding Site West Virginia attorney general also joined in, asking his residents to contact his office to let him know if they had “been victimized by a deceptive act or practice” by GoFundMe. GoFundMe originally shut down donations because of what it called “law enforcement reports of violence and other unlawful activity. At first, GoFundMe said it would refund anyone who asked and donate the remainder to charities chosen by the Freedom Convoy organizers and verified by the site. However, the website later scrapped that plan, saying “donor feedback” led it to simply things and automatically refund all donations. The fundraiser had hit the C$10 million—around $7.9 million in US dollars – with C$1 million already distributed before the fundraiser was halted. GoFundMe’s original plan didn’t sit well with DeSantis. He tweeted, “It is a fraud for @gofundme to commandeer $9M in donations sent to support truckers and give it to causes of their own choosing.” “I will work with @AGAshleyMoody to investigate these deceptive practices — these donors should be given a refund,” the governor said. GoFundMe had issued a statement on why it was taking down the fundraiser. GoFundMe supports peaceful protests and we believe that was the intention of the Freedom Convoy 2022 fundraiser when it was first created. We now have evidence from law enforcement that the previously peaceful demonstration has become an occupation, with police reports of violence and other unlawful activity. To ensure GoFundMe remains a trusted platform, we work with local authorities to ensure we have a detailed, factual understanding of events taking place on the ground. Following a review of relevant facts and multiple discussions with local law enforcement and city officials, this fundraiser is now in violation of our Terms of Service (Term 8, which prohibits the promotion of violence and harassment) and has been removed from the platform. Organizers provided a clear distribution plan for the initial $1M that was released earlier this week and confirmed funds would be used only for participants who traveled to Ottawa to participate in a peaceful protest. Given how this situation has evolved, no further funds will be directly distributed to the Freedom Convoy organizers — we will work with organizers to send all remaining funds to credible and established charities verified by GoFundMe. All donors may submit a request for a full refund until February 19th, 2022 using this dedicated refund form. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said his state’s law prohibited GoFundMe’s plan to redirect money. “#GoFundMe now won’t honor #FreedomConvoy donations and will instead redirect to other charities? In WV, organizations must not deceive donors and engage in deceptive advertising practices. If you’ve been victimized by a deceptive act or practice, let us know!” Morrisey wrote. “According to their website, #GoFundMe is not automatically refunding the donations. Individuals interested in a refund can submit the form below if they do so by Feb 19, 2022. This will avoid the ‘redirecting’ of the donation.” Best of Deadline Cancellations/Renewals Scorecard: TV Shows Ended Or Continuing In 2021-22 Season What's New On HBO Max For January 2022: Day-By-Day Listings For TV Shows & Movies New On Prime Video For January 2022: Daily Listings For Streaming TV, Movies & More Sign up for Deadline's Newsletter.

He called me and we talked. He then said his mom ought to know better but she didn't, and I was right to be angry, but banning her from the house was an overreaction...AITA for banning after this?"" ""OP (the original poster) is not the asshole, although she made two mistakes under extreme provocation, which is understandable. She should not have lost her cool. That's what MIL wanted, and MIL clearly felt empowered by it. And OP should have discussed the matter and agreed upon a response and solution with husband first, rather than deciding unilaterally and now being in the position of having to enforce or give up on an ultimatum, which is damaging to the marriage. These kinds of serious decisions should be made jointly. Her husband is right that it was unfair of her to decide that by herself. In an ideal situation, husband would have handled communicating that to MIL, but OP didn't get that opportunity here due to MIL's machinations."" —u/Curious-One4595 ""Not the asshole. It was a super-inappropriate thing to do, and MIL knew exactly what she was doing, and now she is succeeding in driving a wedge between you and your husband. Good luck for the future. If this is an indication of how things are going to be, you may well need it."" —u/Catatomical ""I think this requires professional mediation, frankly. Husband's view of baseline appropriate behavior is so distorted that OP probably won't be able to get him to see his mother as unreasonable without an objective opinion, and soliciting that opinion from mutual friends would be cathartic, but could make husband very defensive and resentful. If husband reflexively resists counseling/mediation, well, shit, you have your answer about how seriously he takes the marriage."" —u/yet_another_sock ""He needs to back you here. If he doesn't, it's only going to continue to happen. She's going to keep on doing this to you until he stops it or you two break up. It sounds like she's trying to do that so he can get back with his ex."" —u/Liss78",U.S./BuzzFeed,This Wife Banned Her Mother-In-Law From Her House After She Hung A Photo Of Her Son's Ex On The Wall.
