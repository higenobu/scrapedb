4/25/2022,"Aviation history will have to wait but disaster was avoided. Two cousins, Luke Aikins and Andy Farrington, were unsuccessful in completing the first ""plane swap"" Sunday night over the Arizona skies, as one plane spiraled out of control as the two pilots were thousands of feet in the air. Both pilots were safe with no reported injuries. The Red Bull-sponsored flight, which took place at an undisclosed location in Arizona, began as the two pilots ascended to the skies at about 5:45 p.m. local time. Nearly an hour later, the two jumped out at 12,100 feet in the air with the airbrake system engaged on both planes. Aikins was able to successfully get into the other plane, but Farrington was unable to. The plane spiraled out of control as Farrington could be heard saying on-air ""blue plane is out of control."" Farrington then deployed his parachute and safely landed in a remote area. The uncontrolled plane had a parachute on it that automatically activated when it got to a certain altitude, and it was deployed before touching the ground. The condition and location of the plane weren't immediately known. This #RedBull #PlaneSwap in Arizona was crazy! Didn't go as planned but luckily everyone is alright! pic.twitter.com/f9cpRclYtT ‚Äî Aaron Tevis (@AaronTevis) April 25, 2022 The 6-mile-per-hour winds created good conditions for the stunt, the pilots said leading up to the stunt, as the area had faster winds in the days leading up to the event. But Farrington was unsure what happened. ""It just went and instead of stopping in that 90 degree dive, it just kept going and got over on his back,"" Farrington said. ""It was just not a chance."" ""You're just happy everybody's here and good and all that stuff, but just disappointed,"" he added. The key to the mission was the custom-made airbrakes, made with the help of Paulo Iscold, engineer and professor at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.. The brake was developed and tested multiple times over the air in San Luis Obispo, California, more than 150 miles north of Los Angeles, which allowed the planes to somewhat slow down, as they traveled at speeds of up to 140 miles per hour. Aikins noted they were able to test everything for the stunt but the actual dive. He said the plane losing its center of gravity could have played a role during the nosedive. ""I thought I left Andy a good plane. I'm trying to think of what else I could have done to make it better for him when I left,"" Aikins said. ""We do what we can to prepare for this stuff and we hope it never happens. This is the best outcome of a bummer situation, really."" As for if the duo will attempt the stunt again, Aikins said ""we are going to go back and figure this out."" Follow Jordan Mendoza on Twitter: @jordan_mendoza5.

4/25/2022,"PARIS (AP) ‚Äî The far-right has gone mainstream in France. That‚Äôs the headline from the landmark showing by Marine Le Pen in the French presidential election. The fierce nationalist didn‚Äôt win Sunday. But she edged another step closer ‚Äî snatching a victory of sorts from her defeat to reelected President Emmanuel Macron. With 41.5% of the vote, unprecedented for her, Le Pen's anti-foreigner, anti-system politics of disgruntlement are now more entrenched than ever in the psyche, thinking and political landscape of France. Since the Le Pen dynasty ‚Äî first her dad, Jean-Marie, and now Marine, his daughter ‚Äî first started contesting presidential elections in 1974, never have so many French voters bought into their doctrine that multicultural and multiracial France, a country with the words ‚ÄúLiberty, Equality, Fraternity‚Äù inscribed on its public buildings, would be richer, safer and somehow more French if it was less open to foreigners and the outside world. Had she become France‚Äôs first woman president, her plan for fighting Islamic terrorism would have included stripping part of France‚Äôs population ‚Äì women who are Muslims ‚Äì of some of their liberty. She wanted to ban them from wearing headscarves in public ‚Äì hardly very equal or fraternal. Same goes for her proposals to move French citizens to the front of lines for jobs, benefits and housing. For headscarf-wearing voter Yasmina Aksas, Le Pen's defeat wasn't a celebration moment ‚Äî not with such strong backing for her and ideas that ‚Äúused to be limited to militant far-right groups‚Äù becoming increasingly acceptable in polite company. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still 40% of people voting for Le Pen,"" the 19-year-old law student said. ""It‚Äôs not a victory.‚Äù Internationally, Le Pen wanted to start diluting France‚Äôs relationships with the European Union, NATO and neighbor Germany ‚Äî moves that would have been seismic for the architecture of peace in Europe, in the midst of Russia's war in Ukraine. In short, France escaped a political, social and economic electroshock by not voting in Le Pen. Or perhaps just delayed one, should she choose to stand again in 2027. That's a long way off. Much could change. But Le Pen isn't done yet. ‚ÄúIn this defeat, I can‚Äôt help but feel a form of hope,"" she said. ‚ÄúI will never abandon the French."" Surpassing 40% of the vote elevates Le Pen into illustrious, mainstream company. Since Gen. Charles de Gaulle beat Fran√ßois Mitterrand by 55% to 45% in 1965, all defeated finalists lost 40-something to 50-something. With two exceptions, both named Le Pen. Jean-Marie was trounced 82% to 18% by Jacques Chirac in 2002 and Marine lost 66% to 34% to Macron in 2017. Voters used to regard it as their civic duty to keep the Le Pens‚Äô score low, seeing a ballot against them as a blow against racism and xenophobia. Fewer think that way now. By championing cost-of-living issues, befriending the working class, changing her party‚Äôs name and distancing herself from her father, Le Pen broadened her appeal and made herself less scary to growing swaths of France's electorate. Immigration isn't the top concern for all her supporters. They're not all wary of the EU, Muslims and foreigners. But Le Pen does speak to many who feel unheard and uncared for by officials in Paris and Brussels. And so although Macron became the first French president in 20 years to win a second term, he also has failed: Failed to achieve the goal that he set himself at the outset of his presidency. Five years ago, in his triumphant victory speech, Macron pledged to cut the ground from under Le Pen‚Äôs feet by assuaging the voter anger she feeds on. ‚ÄúI will do everything in the five years to come so there is no more reason to vote for the extremes,‚Äù he said. Yet France‚Äôs extremes are now doing better than ever, finding growing, enthusiastic and completely unabashed audiences for ‚Äúus against them‚Äù far-right rhetoric. In far-right speak, ‚Äúus‚Äù are largely white and Christian people being submerged by migration, impoverished by globalization, terrorized by Islamic fundamentalists and losing their French identity to imported cultures, religions and values. ‚ÄúThem‚Äù are all those they blame: the elites, foreigners, financiers, the EU, Muslims, ‚Äúthe system.‚Äù Their list is long. The market for their politics has become so large that this election saw several strains of extremism to choose from. Rabble-rousing former TV pundit Eric Zemmour, who has been repeatedly convicted of hate speech, placed fourth out of the 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10. He makes racial arguments that white French people risk being replaced by non-European immigrants and their children. He sugarcoated France‚Äôs collaboration with its Nazi occupiers in World War II. During his campaign, he filled auditoriums with audiences for his anti-Islam, anti-immigration invective. For Le Pen, he also had the advantage of making her look vanilla and electable in comparison, which also partly explains why she did so well. Together, the far right won 32% of the first-round vote. Now Le Pen has taken another step forward against Macron in the runoff. Not enough to get into power. But closer than ever. __ AP journalist John Leicester has reported from France since 2002.

4/25/2022,"A video was posted on Reddit Thursday showing a driverless Tesla slowly crashing into a $3 million private jet after being ‚Äúsummoned‚Äù by its owner. The Reddit user claims the incident took place at an event hosted by aircraft manufacturer Cirrus at Felts Field in Spokane, Washington. A spokesperson for Cirrus confirmed to Insider that the plane was a Cirrus Vision Jet priced between $3 million and $3.5 million. The person who captured the footage said the Tesla owner was using the ‚ÄúSmart Summon‚Äù feature, which enables the vehicle to leave a parking space and navigate around obstacles to its owner. According to Tesla‚Äôs website, the Smart Summon feature is ‚Äúdesigned to allow you to move Model Y to your location (using your phone‚Äôs GPS as a target destination) or to a location of your choice, maneuvering around and stopping for objects as necessary.‚Äù The company adds, ‚ÄúThis is useful for moving Model Y out of a tight parking spot, through puddles, or helping you retrieve your car while carrying packages. You must maintain a clear line of sight between you and Model Y and closely monitor the vehicle and its surroundings at all times.‚Äù It isn‚Äôt the first time the autopilot feature has resulted in a collision. Back in September 2019, shortly after Smart Summon was first rolled out, a Tesla owner took to Twitter to post a video during which their driverless vehicle nearly crashed into another car after the feature was enabled. ‚ÄúMy first test of Smart Summon didn‚Äôt go so well,‚Äù the user wrote.",Business/Complex,Video Captures Driverless Tesla Crashing Into $3 Million Private Jet,https://news.yahoo.com/video-captures-driverless-tesla-crashing-171352478.html
