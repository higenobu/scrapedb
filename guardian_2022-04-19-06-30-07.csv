4/19/2022,"Russia has began its large-scale military action to seize the east of Ukraine, the country’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. “Now we can already state that the Russian troops have begun the battle for the Donbas, for which they have been preparing for a long time,” he said in a video address. Zelenskiy said a “significant part of the entire Russian army is now concentrated on this offensive”. He added: “No matter how many soldiers are driven there, we will defend ourselves. We will fight. We will not give up anything Ukrainian.” The president’s comments follow a dramatic escalation of attacks by Russia ahead of the long-anticipated operation. Vladimir Putin has declared his intention to seize the Donbas, the industrial heartland in the east of the country already party controlled by pro-Russian separatists. Zelenskiy made clear that the Ukrainian army would battle any attempted advance by Moscow. “No matter how many Russian troops are driven there, we will fight,” he said. “We will defend ourselves. We will do it every day.” Earlier on Monday Russia unleashed a barrage of long-range missiles against targets across Ukraine, in what analysts described as a “softening up” exercise before its military push. Ukrainian government officials warned Russian war-planes were preparing to drop five-tonne bombs on the Azovstal plant in the besieged city of Mariupol. Ukrainian soldiers have been holding out in tunnels under the factory for seven weeks. The underground complex is also being used as a shelter by hundreds of civilians including children. They were about to be wiped out, the officials said. Earlier on Monday four Russian rockets smashed into the western city of Lviv, killing seven people and injuring at least 11. Three hit military infrastructure. But the fourth appeared to have missed its target and landed in a car repair workshop. The city, which is close to the Polish border, has become a haven for civilians fleeing the fighting elsewhere. To the Kremlin’s increasing anger, Lviv has also become a major gateway for Nato-supplied weapons. Zelenskiy has also submitted a filled-out questionnaire in the first step toward obtaining membership in the EU – a desire that has been a source of tension with Moscow for years. Russia’s defence ministry said in a statement that air-launched missiles had wiped out Ukrainian ammunition dumps and other military targets. It said it had hit areas across the country, including the cities of Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, as well as the Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions and the southern port of Mykolaiv. A powerful explosion was reported to have rocked Vasylkiv, a town south of Kyiv that is home to a military airbase, according to residents. There was also further deadly shelling in Kharkiv. Over the past four days, 18 people have been killed and 106 injured. A senior US defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the Pentagon’s assessments of the war, said there are now 76 Russian combat units, known as battalion tactical groups, in eastern and southern Ukraine, up from 65 last week. That could translate to around 50,000 to 60,000 troops, based on what the Pentagon said at the start of the war was the typical unit strength of 700 to 800 soldiers, but the numbers are difficult to pinpoint at this stage in the fighting. The official also said that four U.S. cargo flights arrived in Europe on Sunday with an initial delivery of weapons and other materials for Ukraine as part of a $800m (£615m) package announced by Washington last week. And training of Ukrainian personnel on US 155mm howitzers is set to begin in the next several days. The capture of Mariupol, where Ukraine estimates 21,000 people have been killed, is seen as key, and not just because it would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and complete a land bridge between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, seized by Moscow eight years ago. The US defence official said that if Russian forces succeed in taking full control of Mariupol, that could free up nearly a dozen battalion tactical groups for use elsewhere in the Donbas.",News/World news,Russia begins large-scale military action to seize eastern Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/18/russia-begins-large-scale-military-action-to-seize-eastern-ukraine
4/19/2022,"David “Syd” Lawrence rises to his feet in a meeting room at Gloucestershire’s Nevil Road ground, right leg in a boot because of an achilles injury. His muscles ripple across his shoulders like Himalayan foothills, his hands colossal hams. He is waiting to be unveiled as the club’s next president at that evening’s AGM, the first black president of Gloucestershire and thought to be the first black president at any county. He has big plans to open the game up to people of colour and to children from all backgrounds. “The game has gone through a watershed moment. It’s not looked pretty at all. Historically I suffered racism. And I think it’s important for me as a person of colour to be viewed in the community [to show] that anything is possible.” In the 1980s Lawrence pounded in at terrifying speeds, arms and legs flying off in all directions, his partnership with Courtney Walsh and Kevin Curran meaning that, for a while, Gloucestershire had one of the most feared attacks in the country. England picked him in 1988 and he became the first British-born black man to pull on the dark blue cap. He played five Tests and a single ODI until, on the last day of the 1992 Test against New Zealand at Wellington, he shattered his left kneecap as he reached his delivery stride, finishing his career aged 28. Last year, in Sky’s You Guys are History documentary, Lawrence remembered a teammate leaving a banana skin outside his door at his first away match – pushing him to the gym to toughen up – and racial abuse from crowds. The club issued an apology and Lawrence said he would like to be more involved: the presidency is the result. He intends to do the job differently. Since retirement he has competed as a professional bodybuilder and owns a Bristol nightclub, Dojo. Not your average president’s CV. “I’m not going to be a gin and tonic person with a blazer on – cricket needs a more modern president. I want them to be more in the community doing things as a cricket club,” says the 58-year-old. “I don’t want to hear people’s moans and groans about their chair or that their coffee wasn’t hot. I want to be more of a policy influencer. On my president’s day I want to invite people of colour to the ground who may not have come to cricket before. In that room will be a cross- section of people ... There will be black poets up there, friends I have from Massive Attack. You want the camera to pan into that president’s room and see a different crowd.” “I’m excited. I know what people will say, is it a ticking box exercise? I’m not really interested in what people think … If you keep saying no because it’s a tick in the box exercise, then where do you start?” Recent events have meant cricket is having something of a reckoning. Speaking out about the racial abuse he received as a player was hard, but for Lawrence there are no regrets. “It was very emotional, like therapy. But I’m glad I did it. There’s no doubt about it – people need to know that’s what went on.” He talks about the structures that stop young inner-city kids continuing with cricket into their late teens and is aghast about the decline of Haringey Cricket College. “They were producing a lot of black cricketers and then suddenly – what happened? It got cut. If that was producing the same number of white cricketers, everybody would have hailed it as the best thing ever. “I would like to see more inner-city kids involved, black, white I don’t care. I would love to see a local Gloucester boy walking out to play for Gloucestershire. For me there is nothing more proud, if you’re born and bred for your county, playing for your county. It means so much more.” He is bewildered about the fact that his fellow black Briton and Gloucestershire player Mark Alleyne has not got a big coaching job. “What does that say about our game? Yorkshire is the one that got exposed. Is it the fact that other clubs have just been a lot more clever? “Society has probably got worse [rather] than better with racism. With social media, people can hide behind these platforms. We’ve still got a long way to go.”",Sport/Sport,‘Cricket needs a more modern president’: Lawrence takes on Gloucestershire role | Tanya Aldred,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/18/cricket-david-lawrence-gloucestershire-president-county-championship
4/19/2022,"It is a mark of what a sorrowful environment Manchester United has become, a place of mournful noises, clanking chains, shouts through the wall, that the only idea to have met with near-unanimous approval in the past few months was the prospect of bulldozing Old Trafford into the ground and starting over. There are at least some notes of comfort before the Premier League meeting with Liverpool on Tuesday night. First, the game is at Anfield, where United players being jeered by the crowd represents a return to everyday normality. And second, there has been something comforting of late in the public statements of Ralf Rangnick, whose time as interim manager has evolved into a kind of soft-pedalled trauma therapy. It was always far-fetched to imagine Rangnick could impose a mid-season reboot on this mix-and-match squad. He has settled instead for being the only grown-up in the room, the best response a kind of priestly bedside manner, like the kindly platoon sergeant who holds your hand on the battlefield stretcher and tells you you’re going to be just fine, even as a medical orderly plunges 18 phials of morphine into your upper thigh. The meeting with Liverpool will pique Rangnick’s curiosity in other ways. There is plenty of straightforward jeopardy here. United have a chance to make a dent in Liverpool’s chances of winning the league. Liverpool can put a stake through the heart of United’s hopes of taking fourth place, cueing up another season of stasis. But the most significant subplot is the sense of contrast, and of mimesis. Liverpool are in many senses where United hope to be. The likely hire of Erik ten Hag is an attempt to follow the Jürgen Klopp template for success. Six years ago Klopp had achieved a similar level of success at a similarly placed club. He had the same sense of settled methods and achievable recruitment needs. Ten Hag is an attempt to follow that path. It makes sense, or at least – and this is a low bar – as much sense as anything United have tried to do in recent memory. Beyond this there is the question of style, and above all of “physicality”, an area where Liverpool have been market leaders in the past few years. This has been a common theme of Rangnick’s public musings. “We were second best with regards to physicality,” he said after the draw at Leicester this month. “You cannot win games only in a technical way, you also have to show physicality,” was his verdict on the draw with Southampton in February. “It was not a problem of formation, but of energy and of intensity,” he announced in December after the draw with Newcastle. What does Rangnick mean by this? The most obvious take, the Roy Keane dynamic, is to see a lack of physical pressure as cowardice in the trenches, character-flaw, hairstyle-obsession, Instagram debauchery. Towards the end of the Premier League defeats by Liverpool and Manchester City there was a kangaroo-court element to the TV punditry panels of ex-United players, a kind of sensual delight in declaring here is a team that can be saved only by simple acts of effort, violence, morally redemptive fouling. There is a reason Rangnick speaks about this in a more considered way. That “physicality” is a tactical thing too, bound up in the changing nature of elite football. At clubs like Liverpool and Manchester City physical relentlessness has become a necessity, an element in recruitment decisions, and a non-negotiable baseline alongside all the technical qualities. The idea football has become less physical rests on that fixation with bangs and booms and crashes. In a Klopp or a Pep Guardiola team physicality refers also to the kind of drilled passing and movement that exhausts and degrades an opponent. Pressing, moving, passing, pressing some more: all of these are acts of violence. What was exposed in those United defeats wasn’t moral decadence, but an inability to sustain that intensity, physically and tactically. Perhaps the best way of registering this altered physicality is via the change in what tackling signifies, also the keenest measure of Guardiola’s influence. Twenty years ago the best teams made the most tackles. The top two tacklers in the league were Arsenal and Manchester United. Fast forward to Guardiola’s first season at City and this was still the case: five of the top six also ended up in the top 10 tacklers. The following year this trend was simply dynamited out of existence. City racked up 100 points and won the league by a mile, while also finishing 18th on the tackle table. It is now a total inversion: the better you are the fewer tackles you make. Currently City, Liverpool, Arsenal, West Ham and Chelsea are the bottom five in tackles made. Liverpool are 88th for tackles in Europe’s top five leagues. City, spectacularly, are 98th (ie, last). This is modern physicality: keep the ball, steal the ball, press the ball, move constantly “What is tackles?”, Guardiola famously asked. Tackles are how you know you’re losing, that control has been lost, that you’re leaving a gap for the counter thrust. Collisions and duels are still vital. Liverpool pressed hard from the front like their old selves at Wembley on Saturday. But really the idea is to work and run together, and it is in these joined-up qualities that United also fall short. Here we have a goalkeeper who stays on his line, partnered with a slow, low central defence, creating a familiar stodge in deep areas. The central midfield is poor at forward passing, a disastrous blockage in a team where the attack (which stays upfield) is your real strength. As for pressing high, well, we do have this one guy who’s very good at finishing ... By contrast the fit between Liverpool’s style and personnel provides heat not friction. A high defensive line works when you have speed and positional brilliance in central defence. Let the full-backs rampage: we have powerful workaholic midfielders. And at least two of that front three have to be ready to press hard all game. This is not to say United lack the quality to stretch opponents who have much more riding on this game. This will be Liverpool’s sixth game in 17 days, two more than United, with travel and big-match adrenaline chucked in. But as Rangnick himself has suggested, such is the difference right now in basic intensity, just pressing that throttle for long enough could make the difference.",Sport/Football,Manchester United short on the intensity the modern game demands | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/18/manchester-united-short-on-the-intensity-the-modern-game-demands
4/19/2022,"Good morning. The federal election campaigns continue today, and the first members of the Australian Commonwealth Games teams are to be announced. A former Australian SAS soldier, anonymised before the court as Person 5, alleged by three newspapers to have ordered the execution of an unarmed elderly man in Afghanistan, will be the first witness-in-reply called by Ben Roberts-Smith in his war crimes defamation trial. Person 5, a former SAS patrol commander, was part of a raid on a compound known as Whiskey 108 in the village of Kakarak in Uruzgan. The former soldier has been accused of ordering the execution of an unarmed elderly man, which three newspapers allege Roberts-Smith did nothing to stop. The Liberals and Labor parties have their work cut out to win over voters in Bass and Braddon, two marginal Liberal seats in Tasmania. It’s hard to find voters in either seat with a good word to say about the Scott Morrison or Anthony Albanese. In Penguin, a conversation with a local barber, Linda Murphy, plays out this way. What do you think of Morrison? “Not a lot.” How about Albanese? “About the same.” For either party to win over locals, they’ll need to address the big issues of concern – rising consumer prices, a shortage of affordable housing and poor health services. Russia has unleashed a barrage of long-range missiles against Ukraine, in what analysts described as a “softening up” exercise before a major military push by Moscow to conquer the eastern Donbas region. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff said: “The second phase of the war has started.” Meanwhile, family members of sailors who served onboard the Russian warship Moskva are demanding answers as the ministry has sought to suppress information about what happened to the ship or its estimated 510-strong crew. US defence officials say some Russian soldiers survived the ship’s sinking but Russia has made no efforts to recover the vessel. Much of Australia’s wholesale power costs are double the rate promoted by the Morrison government in last month’s budget, which is at odds with the government’s claims that it has lowered electricity prices. Aboriginal families have been forced to leave the bodies of their loved ones in morgues because they can’t afford a funeral after the financial collapse of their insurer, Youpla Group, which has previously been exposed for its “misleading and deceptive” conduct. The US will urge Australia to increase its 2030 emission reduction pledge this year to avoid “greater destruction” from the climate crisis. A senior official said it was “a long time ago” when the Abbott government set the target that the Morrison government says is “fixed”. In a pandemic of medical misinformation, how do you deal with conspiracy believers? Experts suggest that withholding judgment, appealing to critical thinking and restoring a sense of personal control are helpful techniques when speaking to people who believe in health-related conspiracy theories. Living in a small town can have its advantages when it comes to the rising problem of identity fraud. An attempted identity theft was scuppered in the small NSW town Gilgandra when the local postie “smelled a rat” when a package arrived addressed to a local resident, but to a home that wasn’t hers. Downing Street has been targeted with “multiple” suspected infections using Pegasus hacking software. A report released by Citizen Lab said the United Arab Emirates was suspected of orchestrating spyware attacks on No 10 in 2020 and 2021. Pakistan is “inches away from fully fledged civil unrest” two days after ousting Imran Khan as prime minister, according to Khan’s former information minister Fawad Chaudhry. A surge in violence in India has sparked fears the country is becoming more polarised than ever along Hindu-Muslim lines. At the weekend almost 140 people were arrested in connection with communal violence and rioting. On the day her latest single, Lights On, was released, Harriette Pilbeam was stacking and racking clothes in a shop in Brisbane. As the song and its slick music video racked up tens of thousands of plays, Pilbeam tweeted a meme about the “weird dichotomy” she has been living – Hatchie, the popular musician, getting by in the pandemic by working casual jobs. “It’s … common to be living this weird double life; I did tours with Kylie Minogue, but then went home and worked a random cafe job.” “The government has failed older Australians and anyone who may one day need 24-hour care,” writes Juliane Samara. “As a palliative care nurse practitioner I have looked after thousands of people who have died in residential aged care. I wish I could say that all of them had peaceful, dignified deaths, but I can’t. I’ve seen and heard things you could never imagine. Things that keep me awake at night, dreading the day my family might have to find a place for me in residential aged care.” Pet cats are a major threat to native wildlife so councils are cracking down – but some kitties can still enjoy an outdoor stroll, as long as they’re leashed. The RSPCA says that, unlike dogs, cats are in charge on a walk: The humans are expected to follow them. But not all moggies like the leash. “They’re just like people. Some are much more sociable, outgoing, and some … like to stay home,” Dr Jacqui Ley says. The cost of living in Australia is on the rise, with everyday things like petrol, groceries and rent pushing many into financial stress. But experts claim the government’s cost-of-living measures, unveiled in the federal budget, will disproportionately benefit higher-income earners. In today’s Full Story, Laura Murphy-Oates speaks to inequality reporter Stephanie Convery about the impact of the cost of living on lower-income households, and how the government and the opposition plan to tackle this issue.
