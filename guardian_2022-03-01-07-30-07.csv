3/1/2022,"Aidan Ricketts’ north Lismore house had never flooded before but he woke before dawn to water pouring in. But Ricketts, who owns a 4.5-metre boat, managed to get his own household safe before returning to rescue people living in the surrounding streets. On Monday he ferried 16 people and five dogs to safety. “My [elevated] house is above the one-in-100-year flood standard,” he said. “We were expecting to wake up with high water around us, then go and help other people. I had the tinnie tied up outside but, by 5am the water was coming in the house, so we just went out and rescued other people anyway, because there was nothing I could do for our house.” Ricketts said he could see people in need of rescuing as he was evacuating his own household of six. “As we left, there were neighbours sitting on roofs and we heard people in a roof cavity trying to bash the tin off their roof and get out,” he said. “We heard the banging and went over. They were trying to angle-grind and bash the tin off the roof to get out. We helped them rip the tin off, then another boat came, they are fine. “I’m having trouble remembering how many I rescued, at least 16 from North Lismore. I ferried them across the river to Hindmarsh Street which is the beginning of a hill going up to Goonellabah. That has become our mainland.” Ricketts said he could not estimate how any people were trapped in homes by the flood water on Tuesday. “It is absolutely massive because these floods are at least two metres higher than anything known, so people, who were sure their house was not going to get flooded, would have stayed. I pulled one guy who was just standing there in four foot of water from his house into our boat. “A lot of people had ended up in the ceiling or on the roof but of course the roof is safer.” Ricketts described the flood as being “beyond all records or memories of flooding”. “I don’t think the modelling of any of the services was even designed to cater for this,” he said. “It seems to be part of that incredible confluence of extreme weather events that we are constantly seeing around the world.” Ricketts is not the only local hero. Vincent Marychurch and Jeff Harris told the ABC they had rescued 25 people in their tinnie, after setting out at 4am. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Ricketts said he had barely slept in the 48 hours since the extreme weather arrived in the northern rivers. “I guess you have to stop somewhere but the rescuing thing is addictive because every time you go down a street and get one person you see five others.” Ricketts was having a break on Monday afternoon, and considering whether to continue rescuing. He said his boat had 50 horsepower so could negotiate the water currents. “I only had one offsider in the boat because there is such a premium on body space so you can only have the driver and the person at the front,” he said. “We began with our immediate neighbourhood and our hands were instantly full, but we found that whenever we went just one street further there would be another five or so households needing help. “We took couples, individuals and five dogs. I had to keep bailing the boat because it is still raining.”",News/Australia news,Lismore flood: man saves 16 people and five dogs after losing his own home,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/01/lismore-floods-man-saves-16-people-and-five-dogs-after-losing-his-own-home
3/1/2022,"It was a wall of water. A record-breaking and relentless deluge that lasted days and flooded towns and cities along Queensland’s south-east coast, submerging thousands of homes and leaving at least eight people dead. As the water spreads to northern New South Wales, how did the so-called “rain bomb” develop and why has Queensland’s capital flooded again just 11 years after the devastation of 2011? Last Wednesday, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) warned an area of low pressure over the south coast of Queensland was dragging in moisture from the Coral Sea to the north and then lifting it over the coastline. There had been torrential rain for two days and there was much more to come. At Gympie, 200 kilometres north of Brisbane, a flood warning was issued for the Mary River. Some areas that flow into the river had 300mm of rain in just six hours. Ben Domensino, a meteorologist at WeatherZone, said the low pressure trough was delivering the rainfall, but an area of colder air higher in the atmosphere was drifting in making the atmosphere unstable allowing moisture to be lifted up and dropped as rain. As the trough was expected to move slightly east, computer models showed that by Friday there was “a bit of a bullseye over Brisbane,” a BoM forecaster said. Meanwhile, towards New Zealand, Domensino says an area of high pressure – known as a blocking high – would stop the system from moving away into the Tasman Sea. Large areas of southeast Queensland are placed under a warning for intense rainfall and thunderstorms that would cause flooding. Wivenhoe Dam – Brisbane’s main source of water and also a key piece of infrastructure to stop the city flooding – starts rising rapidly from 58%. Somerset Dam, that can feed Wivenhoe, also starts to rapidly fill, going from 80% to 148% in one day. In the morning, business owners in Gympie’s CBD scramble to get stock out of their stores and residents prepare to evacuate. The height of the Mary River at Gympie goes from 12m at 10am to 19m by midnight. The area of cooler air in the upper atmosphere drifts into the low pressure trough and starts to deliver record-breaking downpours over Brisbane and surrounds. At 10pm, SEQ Water starts to release some of the water building up in Wivenhoe dam. In Gympie, the town’s CBD is inundated. Torrential rain hovers over the Brisbane region, feeding Wivenhoe dam but also filling major rivers like the Bremer that winds through Ipswich and the Lockyer Creek. Both those waterways flow freely into the Brisbane River below Wivenhoe Dam, which is filling at an incredible rate. Prof Stuart Khan, an expert on water management at the University of New South Wales, says Wivenhoe gained about 1,450m megalitres of water “which all came in under three days,” says Khan. That is about three Sydney Harbour’s worth of water. Compared to the floods of 2011, Khan says this is about 50% more water into the dam in about half of the time. “Wivenhoe has never dealt with that volume of water but it was lucky it was down at 60% at the start. If we had started where we started from in 2011 we would be in serious trouble.” As the rain falls, the Brisbane river hits moderate flood levels. There is already local flooding from the intense and incessant rain that is interspersed with violent thunderstorms. Brisbane wakes up to major flooding. The capital’s mayor, Adrian Schrinner, says there is a “rain bomb” over the city. Prime inner city areas including much of the South Bank precinct are underwater. There are scenes of devastation in low-lying suburbs, along creeks, and in the river itself where pontoons break free and ferry terminals are littered with smashed boats and debris. A high tide on Sunday evening pushes Brisbane’s river higher as the rising ocean water effectively holds back the freshwater running down the river. The river peaks overnight at the major flood level of 3.5m, falls slightly after the high tide, and goes higher to eventually peak on Monday at 3.85m – below the 2011 peak of 4.46m. “Nobody has ever seen this amount of rain in such a short period of time over our southeast catchment,” says Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk. There are up to 15,000 homes flooded in the city with 1,544 people in evacuation centres in the southeast. Trains are cancelled, bus services limited, the main Bruce Highway is closed at multiple locations and 51,000 people are without power. At least 3,600 homes are flooded in Gympie. But Khan says the Brisbane flooding could easily have been much worse. “There was a high degree of luck in terms of where we started from [with Wivenhoe Dam],” says Khan, who says climate change change will only raise the risk of future events. “This shows us the risk is real – to have two serious flood events in just 11 years is a pretty high frequency for a major city like Brisbane to have to deal with.” Brisbane has two features that make it susceptible to flooding. A sub-tropical climate naturally suited to big rain events and a city and suburbs built beside rivers and creeks in front of mountain ranges. “We build our cities on rivers for a reason – it was good for transport and waste disposal – but that also means we built on flood plains,” says Khan. As well as the rising river levels, the amount of rain falling locally caused flash floods all across the city and its outer suburbs as creeks swelled, inundating areas that escaped the 2011 floods. According to Domensino, some 611.6mm of rain fell on the city between 9am Friday and 6pm Sunday – the highest three-day total in records dating back to 1840. The previous record was 600.4mm from 1974. Domensino says while several features in the atmosphere combined to deliver the rain, climate change likely made the event worse. “Given climate change is a background to all weather events, it’s hard to say that it does not play a role. We know the oceans are getting warmer and that puts more moisture in the atmosphere, and a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture.” The Bureau of Meteorology has said that heavy rainfall events will get more intense as the world gets hotter. Prof Bofu Yu, of Griffith University’s Australian Rivers Institute, said in the 2011 event rainfall was concentrated in the west and not as widespread as the current flooding. “As a result, flooding this time has been much more extensive from small creeks and large rivers,” he said. As Brisbane starts a long and costly clean up, hundreds of cars are stuck on the main M1 highway to the south. There is devastation in northern New South Wales as Wilsons River rises two metres above previous flood records, inundating the town of Lismore.",News/Australia news,How the unprecedented Queensland and NSW 2022 floods unfolded,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/01/how-the-unprecedented-queensland-and-nsw-floods-unfolded
3/1/2022,"Defense and cybersecurity stocks are seeing a sharp rise in values as investors take note of pledges by the EU to boost defense spending and governments warn of increased threat of cyber intrusions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. US stock markets seesawed again on Monday as the war in Ukraine escalated. Most of the major US markets closed lower after regaining some of their losses but defense contractors continued to gain as investors bet their businesses would benefit from the conflict. Raytheon Technologies, the US defense giant and maker of the Stinger ground-to-air missile that Germany has pledged to supply to Ukrainian forces, has seen its shares price increase more than 10% since the invasion began last Wednesday. Raytheon’s stock rose over 4.6% on Monday and has risen more than 18% this year. Lockheed Martin, the maker of the F-35 fighter jet, advanced more than 5.4% on Monday. The company, with Raytheon, is the manufacturer of the Patriot missile defense system set to be deployed with the Nato battlegroup in Slovakia. Northrop Grumman, leading manufacturer of attack and surveillance drones, saw its stock rise close to 7% on Monday, after rising 3% since the Ukrainian conflict began. Huntington Ingalls Industries, the largest US military shipbuilder, is up over 7%. By contrast, the US Dow Jones Industrials has risen 760 points since 23 February to close at 33,892 on Monday. Outside the US, Britain’s BAE Systems, the largest defense contractor in Europe, Germany’s Rheinmetall, France’s Thales and Italy’s Leonardo have all seen their share prices rise sharply. The jump in defense stocks comes after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that defense spending in Europe’s biggest economy will be increased to 2% of gross domestic product, from an estimated 1.5% in 2021. While the US and its allies haven’t intervened in the conflict on the ground, they have been supplying arms and financial backing. Over the weekend, Germany said it would supply Ukraine with 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles so it can defend itself against Russia and vowed to channel about $113bn into its military this year. “If Germany is feeling pressure to bolster its military and defense systems in this way, other countries are likely to follow suit,” said Investor Place in a note. “This means that companies that produce military technology and weapons are likely to see a significant spike in demand throughout the coming months. Wall Street will be keeping a close watch on defense stocks as the industry prepares for a boom.” But defense analysts have also raised concerns that some companies, including Raytheon, also supply Russian civil use aircraft makers. In a speech last week, Joe Biden said his administration actions and those of allies aimed to “cut off more than half of Russia’s hi-tech imports and we’ll strike a blow to their ability to continue to modernize their military”. That comes as defense contractors watch for signs that the Pentagon will ask Congress for additional funding to pay for increased costs, including the deployment of 7,000 US troops to Europe and the cost of additional surveillance flights. “Russia’s actions in Ukraine have renewed the arguments for higher US defense spending and I think we’re likely to see it grow more than previously expected,” Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said. Congress is set to approve a Department of Defense (DoD) budget of $740bn for 2022-2023. The DoD has been in the process of shifting focus to the Asia-Pacific region. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could alter that calculation, Harrison said. “I think were going to see more of split focus around counter Russia in Europe in the short term and a countering China in the Pacific in the long term.” While the conflict stands to benefit companies that rely largely on defense work, shares of cybersecurity software companies have also risen on expectations of increased spending on security-related services. Among exchange-traded (ETF) funds that track the sector, the Global X Cybersecurity ETF rose 3.6% and is up more than 12% over the past three trading sessions. Morgan Stanley wrote that the heightened geopolitical tension “will continue to provide a strong tailwind for cybersecurity stocks”. Among companies that stand to gain are the cloud storage security firm Zscaler, Crowdstrike Holdings, which markets anti-ransomware services, and Fortinet, a maker of network security systems. “Anytime there is a new threat announced, or there’s a hack or ransomware attack, that’s effectively an advertisement for cybersecurity as something that companies and other organizations need to be investing in,” Hilary Frisch, an analyst at ClearBridge Investments, told Bloomberg this month.",News/Business,Defense and cybersecurity stocks climb amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/28/defense-cybersecurity-stocks-russia-ukraine-eu
3/1/2022,"A Russian oligarch who the EU said is known in Moscow as “Putin’s wallet” is one of 26 businessmen, officials and military figures who have been added to the bloc’s expanding sanctions list. Sergei Roldugin, 71, godfather to Vladimir Putin’s eldest daughter, Maria, and principal cellist of the Kirov Opera Theatre’s orchestra in the 1980s, is among those who it is claimed are threatening the territorial integrity of Ukraine. He joins a total of 680 individuals and 53 entities whose assets in EU member states are frozen and who are under a travel ban. The latest listings include oligarchs and businessmen active in the oil, banking and finance sectors, as well as government officials, military figures and media personalities in Russia. The invasion of Ukraine has prompted a raft of sanctions on Russian individuals, institutions and companies in wide-ranging measures that have helped send the Russian economy into turmoil. Notably, a number of those targeted are described as being within Putin’s small circle of good friends. The legal text approved by EU foreign ministers on Monday evening, says: “Mr Roldugin is a businessman with close ties to Vladimir Putin. He is part of Putin’s network financial scheme. He owns at least 5 offshore entities and he keeps his assets at Bank Rossiya (sanctioned by the Union), known in Moscow as ‘Putin’s wallet’. “According to the investigation of the ICIJ, Mr Roldugin is responsible for ‘shuffling’ at least 2 billion USD through banks and offshore companies as a part of Putin’s hidden financial network. “He also took part in ‘Troika Laundromat’, and he funneled billions of USD through the system. Moreover, he received more than 69 million USD through companies within the ‘Troika Laundromat.’” The Troika laundromat is the name given to a collection of 70 offshore shell companies whose controllers used them to move billions of dollars of private wealth from Russia to the west. The network is said to have worked like a washing machine: money arrived from multiple sources and was then “spun” between network companies and sometimes between multiple bank accounts belonging to a single company. Others on the list, include Igor Sechin 61, the chief executive of Rosneft, the state oil company and one of the world’s largest crude oil producers. He is described by the EU as “one of Vladimir Putin’s most trusted and closest advisors, as well as his personal friend” who is in contact with him on a daily basis. “Igor Sechin’s Rosneft was involved in financing the vineyards of the palace complex near Gelendzhik, which is considered to be personally used by President Putin,” the EU text said. A former KGB colleague of Putin’s, Nikolay Tokarev, 71, who is chief executive of Transneft, a major Russian oil and gas company, is also sanctioned. The text said: “He is Vladimir Putin’s long-time acquaintance and close associate. He served together with Putin in the KGB in 1980s. Mr Tokarev is one of the Russian state oligarchs who assumed control over large state assets in the 2000s as President Putin consolidated power, and who operate in close partnership with the Russian state… “Nikolay Tokarev’s Transneft is one of the main sponsors of the palace complex near Gelendzhik which is widely considered to be personally used by President Putin.” Alisher Usmanov, 68, a businessman who operates in the iron ore and steel, media and internet sectors and said by the EU to be “one of Vladimir Putin’s favourite oligarchs”, is included. “Mr Usmanov has reportedly fronted for President Putin and solved his business problems,” the EU text said. “According to FinCEN files he paid $6million to Vladimir Putin’s influential adviser Valentin Yumashev. “Dmitry Medvedev, the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of Russia and former President and Prime Minister of Russia, benefited from the personal use of luxurious residences controlled by Mr Usmanov.” Others listed are Petr Aven, 64, who has been friends with Putin since the 1990s and is among 50 wealthy businessmen who regularly meet the Russian president; Mikhail Fridman, 55, a key shareholder of the Alfa bank which helped Putin’s eldest daughter, Maria, run a charity project, Alfa-Endo; and Dmitri Peskov, 54, who is Putin’s press secretary.",News/World news,Man known as ‘Putin’s wallet’ among latest names on EU sanctions list,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/man-known-as-putins-wallet-among-latest-names-on-eu-sanctions-list
3/1/2022,"An evacuation order has been issued for the town of Ballina on the New South Wales north coast as the flood emergency moves south. The State Emergency Service issued the alert to South Ballina in the early hours of Tuesday morning. By 7am it said it was too late to move people away from the town and instead advised people in low-lying areas to move to higher ground. “Rising floodwater is beginning to make it unsafe to evacuate the area,” the SES said. “Burns Point Ferry is closed and Wardell Bridge is inundated. You should immediately move to the highest safe place now, such as higher ground or inside a sturdy multi-storey building to upper levels as high above water levels as possible. Do not leave your location unless it is safe to do so.” People have been warned to take their pets, warm clothes, any medication they need, and insurance documents and move to the highest place in their area if safe to do so, and keep moving as the water rises. The emergency services agency warned that residents may be trapped without power, water, or other essential services, and “it may be too dangerous for NSW SES to rescue you”. In the past 18 hours there have also been evacuation orders issued for Casino, Lawrence, Tweed Heads, East Bellingen, Woodburn and Swan Bay, Maclean, Broadwater and Cabbage Tree Island. Ballina had been used as a base for rescue efforts for Lismore, 40km upstream, on Monday, where the Wilson’s River peaked at 14.4m – the worst on record for the northern rivers town. The water broke over the flood levee on Monday morning. It was higher than levels recorded in both 1974 and 1954, and is not expected to drop below major flood levels – 9.7m – until midday Tuesday. More than 4,000 people were rescued by emergency services or neighbours in the Lismore area on Monday and overnight, according to Lismore’s mayor, Steve Krieg, but many people remained isolated on Tuesday morning. Krieg told Channel Seven on Tuesday morning that nine people were still unaccounted for and 400 people were waiting to be rescued. “The police have launched their boats to go out and start that, we also have three army helicopters in the area assisting with winch rescues, so our number one priority today is to make sure every citizen is accounted for, safe and well,” he said. “I know there was 4,000 rescues performed yesterday by emergency service and civilians which is an incredible community effort, we’ll leave the rescues to the professionals today.” There are 70 Australian defence force personnel aiding with emergency response efforts in Lismore, with 100 more being deployed on Tuesday. The danger is now moving to Ballina, where the SES has said up to 7,000 homes could be inundated. The Ballina shire council mayor, Sharon Cadwallader, told the ABC the town was expecting a one-in-500-year flood. “The water will move slowly, but all predictions, all flood modelling that staff have done, we are facing a one-in-500-year flood and that is a serious situation for Ballina,” she said. New flood records were also set along the Tweed River, which peaked at 6.51m at North Murwillumbah, 4.8m at Tumbulgum and 2.95m at Chinderah. At Grafton, the Clarence River peaked at 7.66m, just below the levee height of 7.95m. Flood waters just topped the levee at Ulmarra and are expected to remain below the levee at Maclean.",News/Australia news,Ballina flood evacuation: emergency orders issued for NSW coastal town as waters rise,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/01/ballina-flood-evacuation-emergency-orders-issued-for-nsw-coastal-town-as-waters-rise
3/1/2022,"The severe rain event that has caused major floods in south-eastern Queensland and northern New South Wales is shifting southwards towards Sydney and may develop into an east coast low, meteorologists say. The Bureau of Meteorology issued a slew of warnings for Queensland and NSW on Tuesday, with areas including Sydney likely to get a soaking and buffeting Tuesday into Wednesday. “Heavy rainfall which may lead to flash flooding is forecast to develop over parts of the [Sydney] metropolitan, Illawarra, south coast and parts of central tablelands and southern tablelands forecast districts on either Tuesday night or Wednesday morning,” the bureau said in a warning issued on Tuesday morning. “Six-hourly rainfall totals between 80 and 120 mm are likely, most likely south of Gosford.” As trough shifts south, so does the rain on Tuesday, with Sydney and other areas set for a soaking. Falls of 80-120mm are possible, @BOM_NSW warns: https://t.co/TKZsfGfKV3 pic.twitter.com/4bc8zxl4wV The source of the rain was a trough that would form into a low pressure system off the northern NSW coast before moving towards central parts of the NSW coast and deepening into an east coast low, the bureau said. East coast lows typically bring damaging winds along with heavy rain, with the intensity of the effects depending on how close and how long it lingers near the coast. Areas hard-hit by flooding in Queensland and NSW should gain some relief from Tuesday as the trough moves offshore. Ben Domensino, a senior meteorologist with Weatherzone, said the main weather models did not quite agree on the precise area of the heaviest rain and wind, but people in a stretch of the coast from Gosford southwards, including Sydney, should prepare for significant falls. And an east coast low could develop off shore on Tuesday, with more heavy falls then: @BOM_au pic.twitter.com/yIKQpKJ0gT “What the models are agreeing on is that a low [pressure system] will gain strength and move towards the coast somewhere over the central or southern coast of New South Wales,” Domensino said. “So there will be heavy rain, potentially damaging winds and dangerous surf starting from later today, and then through Wednesday and Thursday,” he said. “But where the heaviest falls out will depend on where that line moves. “But I think for the south coast, the Illawarra, you can pretty much lock in the heavy rain and flood potential.” And over the coming eight days, some of the rainfall totals could get into the 100s of mm...in catchments that are already pretty wet, with dams that are already nearly full or spilling: @BOM_au pic.twitter.com/HBVqqBZSEj WaterNSW on Monday said Sydney’s main reservoir, Warragamba Dam, would probably start to spill into the Hawkesbury-Nepean floodplain later this week. Just how much rain the area gets would depend on where the east coast low forms, Domensino said. At this stage, though, most rain was looking like it would land on coastal areas. The bureau’s forecasts now have Warragamba receiving as much as 70mm to 100mm of rain on Wednesday and 30mm to 50mm on Thursday. Warragamba was at 98.7% capacity on Monday, and the catchments were either full or close to it, with several likely to spill.",News/Australia news,Flash flood warning for parts of Sydney and nearby NSW districts as wild weather moves south,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/01/flash-flood-warning-for-parts-of-sydney-and-nearby-districts-as-severe-rain-event-moves-south
