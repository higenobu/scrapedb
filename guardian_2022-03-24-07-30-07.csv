3/24/2022,"The smile said it all. Lifelong Arsenal fan Lotte Wubben-Moy’s equaliser late on salvaged a 1-1 draw against Wolfsburg in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final and she beamed widely. Tabea Wassmuth had given the German side a first-half lead but Wubben-Moy’s strike, in her first start at the Emirates, ensured Arsenal travel to Germany next week with the tie level. The gulf between England’s best and Champions League royalty was in evidence again as Arsenal, despite seeing far more of the ball than they had against Barcelona in December at this ground, were made to look as ordinary as they make teams in the Women’s Super League look week in, week out. Wolfsburg, having competed in five of the last nine finals, winning twice in 2013 and 2014, understand what it means to progress in the Champions League. Under the floodlights at the Emirates, it was the home team – the only English side to have won a women’s European Cup but were absent from the competition from 2015 to 2018-19 – that began brightly. In the opening minute, England forward Beth Mead dragged her shot wide after she was slipped through on the left by Stina Blackstenius. “They play a little bit differently to the teams we play regularly, they have a different style,” said the Arsenal manager, Jonas Eidevall, prior to the game. “Wolfsburg are very, very good on the counter attack, and we haven’t played a team so far this season that has been that good on the counter. At the same time, I don’t think they have been exposed to our style of football either.” Arsenal were dominant in possession, playing with a fluidity and confidence that had been missing from their two group stage encounters with the seemingly unstoppable Barcelona and against Hoffenheim on the road. Yet Wolfsburg were decidedly untroubled by their lack of the ball or Arsenal’s style. In fact it suited their counter-attacking game; while Arsenal worked hard to play their own way, Wolfsburg waited for their moment to pounce. Midfielder Lia Wälti had warned that underestimating Wolfsburg would be a big mistake. The possession stats at half-time told one story, with Arsenal controlling 58% of the game, but the shots on target revealed the other side. Beth Mead cutting inside before firing straight at goalkeeper Almuth Schult was Arsenal’s sole effort on target in six attempts. Meanwhile, Wolfsburg finished the half with three attempts, each on target, and one yielding the goal that gave them the edge. In the 19th minute, Joelle Wedemeyer knocked the ball back into the middle of the six-yard box and Wassmuth squeezed past Mead to head under the falling Manuela Zinsberger. The second half began in a similar vein, with Arsenal pulling the strings and Wolfsburg apparently happy to let them. There was a brief moment of celebration for the fans in attendance as Wälti pinged a ball through to Blackstenius from deep and the Swede rounded Schult neatly before firing into the empty net, but the flag was quickly whipped up for offside. Seven-time winners Lyon were beaten 2-1 by Juventus in the first leg of their Women's Champions League quarter-final in Turin. Lyon took the lead through Catarina Macario's header in the eighth minute and dominated much of the game without adding to their opener. Sonia Bompastor's side were punished after the game turned in the 62nd minute when Ellie Carpenter was sent off for bringing down Lisa Boattin as the last defender. Cristiana Girelli levelled nine minutes later after a mistake from Lyon keeper Sarah Bouhaddi. Lyon dug in to try and see out a draw, but substitute Agnese Bonfantini [pictured] ran on to Arianna Caruso's superb through ball in the 83rd minute and found the bottom corner to secure a shock result and give Juve the edge before the return leg. Shortly after, Mead’s ball across the face of goal was narrowly missed by a sliding Vivianne Miedema, but once again the German team would carve open the Arsenal backline. First, the goalscorer Wassmuth, who scored four times against Chelsea in the group stages, crashed her strike off the inside of the post and the ball bounced clear. Within seconds Lena Lattwein found Svenja Huth, but the forward could only turn it against the other post and Arsenal were able to scramble it away. Eidevall turned to his bench in search of a an equaliser, bringing on US World Cup winner Tobin Heath, midfielder Frida Maanum and England’s Nikita Parris, but it would be young centre-back Wubben-Moy that would pull them back into the tie, collecting Heath’s weak free-kick and hammering home. “I genuinely think being a fan of the team you play for gives you 10% more when you’re playing,” Wubben-Moy told the Guardian in December. “If that’s what wins you a game, it’s those little percentages that makes a difference. Then be a fan of any club that you can and play at that club, because it’s an amazing experience.”",Sport/Football,Wubben-Moy strikes late to rescue draw for Arsenal against Wolfsburg,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/23/arsenal-wolfsburg-womens-champions-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report
3/24/2022,"One final Test match of the winter for Joe Root and his England team begins on the spice island of Grenada on Thursday, offering a chance to reset the oft-repeated statistic of one series victory in the Caribbean since the 1960s before the actual reset begins under new management this summer. England swept a broom through the squad before this tour, dropping two champions in the process, and have endlessly talked up collaboration and progress during the two stalemates in Antigua and Barbados, but their winter remains winless to date. With no full-time managing director or head coach as yet – Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood are only the respective interims – the true blueprint for this side is yet to reveal itself. As such, and for all the runs the batters have finally harvested from the two sleepy surfaces thus far, everyone in the setup – players and support staff – could do with a performance and, ideally, the newly minted Richards-Botham trophy heading to Lord’s next week. Even Root, the great survivor of the Ashes recriminations, has no certainty whether he will remain as captain when regime change occurs, even if his desire to do so remains undimmed. “I don’t think it puts any pressure on me,” Root said when asked about this. “I think I’m the right man to take the team forward. [But] if the head coach comes in and thinks differently, that’s fine, that’s his decision. While I’m in this position, I’ll do everything to make this team as good as I possibly can. “The thing that is in my control, is helping this team put in a really strong performance and win this series, which would be a phenomenal achievement; not many teams have done it,” the England captain added. “Off the back of a very difficult winter, it would be a great way to round things off and start this year.” Grenada’s cricketing heritage is not as deep as other Caribbean countries, a population of 112,000 providing just six of the 385 men to play for West Indies. The sport is visible, however, with local games being played in St George’s this week and the hulking great National Stadium, built with help from China before the 2007 World Cup, hosting its first Test match since 2015. Root has happy memories from that match, when he became the first English batsman to score a Test century on St George’s Day in a nine-wicket victory. England Lees, Crawley, Root (capt.), Lawrence, Stokes, Bairstow, Foakes (wk), Woakes, Overton, Leach, Mahmood.  West Indies (possible): Brathwaite (capt.), Campbell, Brooks, Bonner, Blackwood, Holder, Da Silva (wk), Joseph, Roach, Permaul, Permaul, Seales. Clouds can tumble down the neighbouring hills at short notice for swing and there is talk of more life in a pitch that had grass on it with 24 hours to go, such that Root indicated that Matt Parkinson wouldn’t come in as a second spinner before England named their XI. It will be Jack Leach and the fast-mediums, with Craig Overton replacing Matt Fisher and Chris Woakes offered a reprieve thanks to Ollie Robinson making it a hat-trick of absences. Three weeks on from suffering a back spasm in the solitary warm-up match, and after an Ashes tour marred by conditioning issues, Robinson’s latest setback raises yet more questions over his battle with fitness. Root wasn’t inclined to expand on whether there is an underlying issue here – and no scans have been done – saying it was one for the (rarely on-record) medical staff. With Jofra Archer, Olly Stone and Mark Wood among those also missing – the latter seeing a consultant about his elbow this weekend amid talk of surgery – Robinson’s issues aren’t just about his own efforts, but may see the new MD and head coach take a view on England’s husbandry of their fast bowlers more broadly. Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad – two bowlers with unimpeachable credentials as regards preparation, yet back home on the golf course – are starting to look like the exceptions here. “On the wickets we’ve had, it would have been nice to throw the ball to Mark Wood occasionally,” Root replied, when asked if he’d like to have been able to call upon either Anderson or Broad during this series. “That extra bit of pace would have served us well. And his skills with the reverse swinging ball.” Though Fisher will now wait until his summer back at Yorkshire to press claims for a second cap, having learned plenty about how hard bowling outside of England can be, Saqib Mahmood has the chance to show he can back up an impressive debut in Bridgetown that saw him fleetingly transcend conditions. The 25-year-old looks hungry to succeed and, though not the same pace as Wood, could turn out to be the biggest plus from the tour. More broadly the hope is that an enticing contest bubbles up at a time when a raft of draws have led to some remarkably knee-jerk fears about Test cricket. There is a more legitimate question about its health in the Caribbean – whether it is like the bleached coral found off the coastline that once dazzled so brightly – but West Indies have a proud captain in Kraigg Brathwaite and are open about a goal to ensure England’s past struggles in the Caribbean rumble on. “We want to finish strong and keep that record intact. It would mean a lot for the Caribbean people,” said Brathwaite, leader of a Test side which knows a thing or two about the kind of upheaval their visitors are wrestling with this winter.",Sport/Sport,Joe Root seeks England series win to leave ‘very difficult’ winter behind,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/23/cricket-joe-root-england-west-indies-preview
