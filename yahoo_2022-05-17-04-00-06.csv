5/17/2022,"The remains of Brittanee Drexel were found May 11 in Georgetown, South Carolina. Drexel was 17 years old in 2009 when she was reported missing from Myrtle Beach. She was visiting the area from Rochester, New York with some friends. She was last seen on surveillance video leaving the Blue Water Resort, on Ocean Boulevard. Media had swarmed to Georgetown County last week following the reported arrest of Raymond Moody, previously named a person of interest in Drexel’s disappearance. Moody has been charged with murder and kidnapping. Moody, 62, was charged with obstruction of justice, a charge authorities declined to confirm was related to the Drexel case. But the offense date listed for the charge was April 25, 2009 — the same date Drexel was reported missing — according to a South Carolina Law Enforcement Division background check. Numerous media outlets had reported late last week law enforcement officials combing through a wooded area with heavy equipment on the outskirts of Georgetown County — with some reporting human remains were found — but authorities declined to confirm those reports at the time. Local and federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, have long sought and followed leads related to Drexel’s disappearance. They believed they’d made a big break in the case during 2016, when jailhouse informants told investigators they had seen her in a “stash house” in the Georgetown County area being abused as a human trafficking victim. They believed Drexel had been shot, and her body thrown into a gator pit, but multiple law enforcement searches in areas where reported witnesses believed her body had been placed yielded no evidence, and no arrests were made.",U.S./Myrtle Beach Sun News,Missing no more: Brittanee Drexel’s remains found in SC years after disappearance,https://news.yahoo.com/missing-no-more-brittanee-drexel-180609885.html
5/17/2022,"Governor Ron DeSantis (R-FL) announced $125 million in funding for nursing and claimed the Florida government is going to take care of Disney’s debt while speaking at Seminole State College, Sanford, Florida today. According to reports, the Walt Disney Company’s self-government status will be repealed and the Reedy Creek Improvement District will be dissolved in 2023, leaving the local taxpayers with more than $1 billion in bond debt. But DeSantis and his administration insisted that the people of Florida will not be burdened with more taxes. He went on to say that Florida has the lowest per Capita tax burden and assured that, “I have the biggest budget surplus we've ever had. There would be no basis to ever do any type of raising taxes”. He claimed that since Disney has enjoyed all the subsidies over the years, the state and local governments will be collecting more taxes from the company itself. DeSantis was joined by Dr. Joseph Ladapo, Florida’s Surgeon General who called the vaccine mandates for all nurses “lunacy” while speaking at the same event.",U.S./The Recount,"Gov.

5/17/2022,"Since the beginning of the Russian invasion, tens of thousands of volunteers from many countries have joined the Ukrainian military on the battlefield – well-trained, experienced and equipped fighters of the world's strongest armies. Most of them joined the International Legion of Territorial Defense under the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which was created in late February by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky specially for foreign citizens. Rhee, 38, a former navy seal and lieutenant of the Navy special unit of the Republic of Korea, who arrived in Ukraine in early March, is one of such fighters. After eight years of military service, Rhee earned a solid resume: he held several government positions in his homeland, worked in the U.S. and UN Departments, took part in a popular show about the military and runs a YouTube channel with 800,000 subscribers. Prior to arriving in Ukraine, Rhee ran a company, which provided advisory services to the military and police, as well as helping the entertainment industry make military films. Another area of his business is the rescue of victims of global catastrophes, one of which, according to the Korean volunteer, is taking place in Ukraine now. Read also: Texas paratrooper and Iraq veteran reveals his reasons for protecting Ukraine NV: Why are you here, what was your motivation to fight for Ukraine? Rhee: Everyone has a reason to come to Ukraine. For me, this is absolutely a matter of morality. I saw on TV what was happening here, I couldn't believe that Russia could just invade a sovereign state. In my head, I knew who were the bad guys and who were the good guys. At first, President Zelensky said that only European neighboring countries were needed. So I thought I wouldn't be able to come from Korea. But when he explained that it could be volunteers from all over the world, I immediately packed my bags. It's like walking down the street and seeing two guys raping a woman. Will you just watch? Especially if you are trained to do something about it, if you have the experience to help. For me, doing nothing is a crime in itself. That's why I'm here. As a former special forces operator, I have skills that can really help the military here. If I just sit idle, doing nothing and watching CNN, it will be wrong. NV: What does your family think about the decision to fight so far from home and for another country? Rhee: My mother is always worried, she's hysterical now, she doesn't like that I'm here. I'm trying to calm her down, I'm telling my relatives that someone should go to Ukraine and help. And they say: ""Why you? Someone else can do it!"" However, it's important for me to be here, even if my family doesn't agree with me, to help locals and the military. NV: What did you know about Ukraine before coming here? Rhee: I'm here for the first time and, despite the fact that I came to the war, I'm very glad to be here. Before that I knew a little about Ukraine, because I studied international political science in college. This is one of the countries I was really interested in. I know that Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, had a complicated history with Russia and nuclear weapons, which it renounced in exchange for peace and security. Which, obviously, didn't happen. Once I was in Russia, in Vladivostok. It's not far from Korea, and many Koreans go there for sightseeing and tourist trips. So when I came to Ukraine, I noticed that it all reminded me of the history of South and North Korea. For a foreigner, at first glance, people seem to have much in common, such as similar language and appearance. But these are different countries that have always been at war with each other. NV: What was your combat experience, and have you already fought here in Ukraine? Rhee: As part of the Korean navy seals, we rescued hostages in Somalia: there were many counter-terrorist operations there in 2009-2011, and I gained a lot of combat experience there. After that, I was in Iraq during quite difficult periods, just as I came to Ukraine – in the first week of the war, when Kyiv was under threat of enemy invasion. Read also:  20,000 foreign volunteers ready to join Ukraine’s army defensive operation against Russia  Then we had successful missions in Irpin. But there were also not very successful when two of my comrades were wounded. We fought against Russian tanks, armored vehicles and soldiers in the central park of Irpin, which we were trying to liberate. And I'm happy to be part of two groups of liberators who eventually expelled the Russians. After Irpin, we went to the south of Ukraine. Now my team is still on a mission there, but I was wounded during the last military operation and have to spend a few days in a military hospital under examination. NV: What did you like most about Ukraine and what was the hardest thing about staying here? Rhee: I was very impressed by how kind and sensitive the Ukrainian people were to foreigners, even during the war no one was angry or annoyed. This is a unique situation: there is a cult of foreign fighters in Ukraine, and everyone is ready to help them. As for the difficulties: when I arrived in Ukraine in early March, it was really very cold. It was colder than in Korea, so it was difficult to fight. We should always think about clothes, because we go on a four-five-day mission and sleep in places without electricity. One of my comrades even had hypothermia, and we had to evacuate him. The second is nutrition. It's not always good at the forefront: we eat chicken porridge for breakfast, lunch and dinner. But every time we come to Kyiv to replenish our stocks, I love to taste local cuisine: the restaurants are great here, the traditional borsch is very good. It looks like tomato soup, but I like it. NV: What is your relationship with Ukrainians and other foreign legionnaires? Rhee: I worked with Ukrainian special forces on the battlefield, and they are exceptional professionals, very well-trained fighters. But it was also quite difficult because of the great cultural and mental differences. I trained with the Korean and U.S. military, where we always spent a lot of energy on planning. Ukrainian fighters are somewhat different, they are like a flash – they just go and fight, improvising. This is a very good combat mentality, but I and many Americans or Britons have a culture shock because of the big difference in approaches to fighting. I met Georgians, but I think they're also very militant. Sometimes they don't have good equipment, training or strategy, they don't pay special attention to weapons or equipment. However, they're fighting like real fearless warriors. But there are few Koreans here: I think only me and maybe a few other guys. There have been about 10 of us since the beginning of the war. Many Ukrainians are still surprised to see an Asian, because it's a very rare phenomenon. NV: How do you see the end of this war and what are your personal plans for the future? Rhee: If Ukraine does not win the war, any neighboring country that opposes Russia or tries to join NATO will be under threat. Russia will continue to attack, and it will never end. Therefore, I believe that this war is, in a sense, a world war. I think it will either take a long time or Putin will die of disease or cancer. He's not one of those guys who gives up easily. And Ukraine is definitely not going to surrender. That's why the war will last for some time. What does this mean for me? It's obvious that one day I'll have to go back home to reboot myself, get better equipment, better prepare and come back here again. To keep doing what I do until Ukraine wins. The problem is that my stay in Ukraine is considered illegal at home. Each country has different laws, and the Korean ones are very strange. Therefore, I think that when I return, they will try to arrest me at the airport only for participating in this war. I'm planning to receive several letters from the Ukrainian government, and I hope they will help me in court. I already have a lawyer. But even at the risk of being imprisoned, I still believe that I made the right decision. I'm happy to be here, change the situation and work with Ukrainians.",World/The New Voice of Ukraine,South Korean ex-navy seal shares story of fighting in Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/south-korean-ex-navy-seal-141600702.html
5/17/2022,"Price levels continue to rise at a rate we haven’t seen in decades. In April, U.S. consumer prices surged 8.3% — down slightly from 8.5% in March, but still near 40-year highs. Spiking inflation has severe consequences for your cash savings. Fortunately, investing legend Warren Buffett has plenty of advice on what to own when consumer prices spike. In a 1981 letter to shareholders, Buffett highlighted two business traits that investors should look for when trying to fight inflation: 1) the power to increase prices easily, and 2) the ability to take on more business without having to spend excessively. Here are four Berkshire holdings that largely boast those characteristics. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. Last year, American Express demonstrated its pricing power as it raised the annual fee on its Platinum Card from $550 to $695. The company also stands to directly benefit in an inflationary environment. American Express makes most of its money through discount fees — merchants are charged a percentage of every Amex card transaction. As the price of goods and services increases, the company gets to take a cut of larger bills. Business is booming. In Q1, the company’s revenue jumped 29% year over year to $11.7 billion. American Express is the fifth-largest holding at Berkshire Hathaway. Owning 151.6 million shares of AXP, Berkshire’s stake is worth nearly $24 billion. Berkshire also owns shares of American Express competitors Visa and Mastercard, although the positions are much smaller. American Express shares currently offer a dividend yield of 1.3%. Coca-Cola is a classic example of a recession-resistant business. Whether the economy is booming or struggling, a can of Coke is affordable to most people. The company’s entrenched market position, massive scale, and portfolio of iconic brands — including names like Sprite, Fresca, Dasani and Smartwater — give it plenty of pricing power. Add solid geographic diversification — its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the globe — and it’s clear that Coca-Cola can thrive through thick and thin. After all, the company went public more than 100 years ago. Buffett has held Coca-Cola in his portfolio since the late ’80s. Today, Berkshire owns 400 million shares of the company, worth approximately $25.8 billion. You can lock in a dividend yield of 2.7% on Coca-Cola's shares at current prices. No one who spends $1,600 for a fully decked-out iPhone 13 Pro Max would call it a steal. But consumers love splurging on Apple products anyway. Earlier last year, management revealed that the company’s active installed base of hardware has surpassed 1.65 billion devices, including over 1 billion iPhones. While competitors offer cheaper devices, many consumers don’t want to live outside the Apple ecosystem. That means, as inflation spikes, Apple can pass higher costs to its global consumer base without worrying too much about a drop in sales volume. Today, Apple is Buffett’s largest publicly traded holding, representing nearly 40% of Berkshire’s portfolio by market value. Of course, the sheer increase in Apple’s stock price is one of the reasons for that concentration. Over the past five years, shares of the tech gorilla have surged more than 280%. Apple currently offers a dividend yield of 0.6%. One of Buffett’s big moves in 2022 is loading up on Chevron. According to an SEC filing, Berkshire owned $25.9 billion of the energy giant as of Mar. 31 — a significant jump from its stake of $4.5 billion at the end of 2021. Today, Chevron represents the third-largest public holding at Berkshire. It’s not difficult to understand why. Even though the oil business is capital intensive, it tends to do very well during periods of high inflation. Oil — the most heavily traded commodity globally — has soared 45% year to date. And the supply shock caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could keep that trend going. Strong oil prices benefit oil producers. Chevron’s latest quarterly earnings more than quadrupled year over year. The stock is up nearly 40% in 2022. The company returns cash to investors, too. Paying quarterly dividends of $1.42 per share, Chevron has an annual yield of 3.4%. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms.
