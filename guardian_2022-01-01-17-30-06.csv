1/1/2022,"The funeral of Desmond Tutu got under way on Saturday morning in Cape Town in the cathedral that the South African cleric and Nobel laureate turned into a centre of struggle against racial injustice. As a steady rain lashed the outside of Saint George’s, mourners took their places amid hymns and organ music before the ceremony started at 10am.  Tributes from world leaders poured in after Tutu’s death aged 90 was announced on Sunday, and within South Africa, many have been deeply moved by the passing of the last great hero of the struggle against the repressive, racist apartheid regime. Church bells have been rung at noon across South Africa every day and flags flown at half mast. There have been dozens of memorial services, South Africa’s cricket team wore black armbands in Tutu’s honour on day one of the first Test against India in South Africa and Cape Town’s Table Mountain was lit up in purple in Tutu’s honour. Mourners within the cathedral have been restricted to a hundred due to Covid regulations. They included Tutu’s widow, Leah, and his four children, as well as South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, who is expected to read a eulogy. The ceremony will be led by Dr Thabo Makgoba, the current archbishop of Cape Town, and a sermon given by Michael Nuttall, the former bishop of Natal who was a close friend and collaborator of Tutu. On Friday, hundreds queued outside the cathedral, waiting to pay their respects before the plain wooden casket decorated with a single bunch of carnations in accordance with Tutu’s wishes. Tutu, who requested a funeral without lavish expense or ostentation, will be cremated and his ashes interred beneath the floor of St George’s, “a place that he loved”, church officials said. As Anglican archbishop of Cape Town, the former school teacher preached a powerful message of justice, inter-communal harmony and faith. During the 1980s Tutu turned St George’s into a refuge for activists who faced brutal repression from the forces of the racist apartheid regime in power in South Africa until 1994. Though he had largely faded from public life in more recent years, Tutu had continued his lifelong fight for causes he believed in, forcefully supporting LGBT rights, equal access to education and the assisted dying movement. In remarks earlier this week, Ramaphosa called him a man of “extraordinary intellect, integrity and invincibility against the forces of apartheid”. Others have dubbed Tutu “the moral compass” of South Africa. A memorial will be held at Westminster Abbey in London in the next three months, at a date to be confirmed by the Abbey and Buckingham Palace, church officials in Cape Town said.",News/World news,Funeral of Desmond Tutu takes place in Cape Town,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/01/funeral-of-desmond-tutu-takes-place-in-cape-town
1/1/2022,"If you pay close enough attention you will notice that there are only three types of dating show: “laughs”, “influence” and “genuinely wanting romance”. The first category, laughs, barely counts: participants on these one-episode dating shows are rarely in it for anything other than a story, ironically enough to use as a conversation starter on subsequent, untelevised dates – “An interesting fact about me? Oh, uh: my episode of Dinner Date is still available on ITV Hub for the next 19 days”, “Ah, yeah? I got sent home after the penis round on Naked Attraction”. Second is the blockbuster dating format, where everyone entering a villa half-hopes not for love but for a significant uptick in Instagram followers and the offer to open a shop in a local mall for a head-spinning amount of cash. These shows litter our screens in the summer months – a Love Island, an Ex on the Beach, a Ready to Mingle. (Play the game right and you can enter the Love Island villa at the start of the summer and leave the Celebs Go Dating villa at the end of the following winter.) Then you get what Channel 4 excels in: taking people who are 30 or almost 30 or a bit past 30, and all emotionally damaged by something in their romantic history, and throwing them into a speculative dating show that, if sociologists enacted it in the 60s, we’d be talking about now in the hushed tones we use when we mention the Stanford prison experiment. Anyway: welcome to The Language of Love (Channel 4, Tuesday, 10pm).  It is exactly as ridiculous as it sounds: six lovelorn Brits do their little pre-roll interviews saying they’ve tried everything and they just can’t find the missing piece, all they want is love, and they’re willing to travel to the Costa del Sol to find it, and blah blah blah blah blah. Then they get on a rickety coach and exchange tentative banter with each other (lads blasting the question “OI, WHAT’S YOUR TYPE?” at each other like a football) as it winds up a hill. Then Davina McCall pops out, the pedigree presenter to end all other presenters, and tells them: you’ve all tried everything, you all failed to find the missing piece, you all want love and, guess what, today you’re going to find it. But guess what guess what: none of the sexy singles we’re going to introduce you to can speak English, and none of you can speak Spanish. You have to negotiate heavy petting with the same staccato elan you use to order an omelette at a Tenerife hotel. Channel 4 more than any British channel understands the need to fill January, the most miserable of months, with a captivatingly absurd dating show. This is how they got me hooked on Married at First Sight: Australia last year. (What else was I going to do? I’d spent all my Christmas money and I wasn’t drinking.) The Language of Love seems similarly primed for an audience of people who can’t legally leave the house for whatever reason. As a result, I’m already resigned to watching it to the bitter end. After the initial group meetings between the Spanish boys and the British girls, you think: “How fun can this be, really? They keep misunderstanding each other. Nobody knows how to count. This is stupid.” Then, a banquet-style paella meal and some sangria jugs later, and the electric crackle of human chemistry is somehow overriding the language barrier, and you’re engrossed. Kimey, a medical student, is infatuated with Akonne, a surprisingly sweethearted Brummie MMA fighter. Tracy and Thalia are squabbling over the same hotel worker. The whole thing seems to be filmed on the exact same hardware they use for the grainy interior shots of First Dates Hotel, so you keep expecting Fred to turn up. Instead, as Davina and co-host Ricky Merino watch from a distant balcony, you actually spy something darker and more primal: the inherent human impulse to try to get off with someone even if you can’t confidently tell them where the library is. It doesn’t make sense that this show is as good as it is, but then it doesn’t make sense that any human would spend a fortnight trying to forge a horny lingua franca just because Davina McCall told them to, and yet here we are. This is what your January looks like. Staring into the abyss of the human condition and seeing just how deep it can go.",Arts/Television & radio,The Language of Love: the absurd dating show that will save your January,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/01/the-language-of-love-the-absurd-dating-show-that-will-save-your-january
1/1/2022,"Like every other spectacles wearer I know, I’m adamant that my prescription has deteriorated disproportionately during the pandemic. Where forgetting my glasses was once a mere inconvenience, it’s now a crisis that forces me home to retrieve them. It’s been an interesting process, beauty-wise – what one gains in not being able to see gaping pores, one loses in the ability to apply a straight swoosh of liner. Sight isn’t the only consideration. Specs cast a shadow (anti-reflective coating helps), so concealer has to work harder to brighten dark circles (I use Dior Forever Correct, £27), and thick frames can obscure hard work done on eyeshadow, which can be both a blessing and a curse, depending on the application. For days when my glasses will be on and off as often as a teenage romance (I wear a librarian’s chain from Missoma), I want eye makeup to be simple but noticeable.  The solution almost always comes via a crayon. By far the easiest eyeshadow with a tremendous effort/effect ratio, crayons are a must for specs wearers. The bullet shape means that even an approximate aim lands on target. After drawing creamy colour on to the lid, I simply take a clean, fluffy brush and soften the edges. The technique is foolproof. For years, Bobbi Brown made the only great crayons (Long-Wear Cream Shadow Sticks, £25, are still the longest-lasting), but I’ve diversified to include Vieve’s Eye Wands, £21, which fill some gaps in the Bobbi shade lineup. Vieve’s Sand, a pale, warm nude, is a no-brainer lid colour on lighter skins, and a terrific brow bone highlighter on darker tones. Camel and Hazelnut are warm, neutral nudes that work on everyone (more shades coming this month). Perhaps prompted by the threat to its monopoly on crayons, Bobbi Brown has introduced some delicious new shades, too. Cashew and Shore are two endlessly useful neutrals (warm and cool, respectively) and Skyward is a universally flattering metallic chartreuse for more playful looks. All can be swiped underneath the eye and smudged in the same way, which helps enormously if your eyes appear to recede behind your glasses, as mine do. What has become absolutely crucial over time is a SimpleHuman sensor mirror (£290). Illuminated, mega magnifying and as pricey as it is indispensable, it allows me to apply, sans specs, the complex makeup looks that I once took for granted. You won’t regret a penny of the considerable outlay.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Specs appeal: what’s the best way to apply make up as a glasses wearer?,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/01/specs-appeal-whats-the-best-way-to-apply-make-up-as-a-glasses-wearer
1/1/2022,"It’s the time of year for reinventions – or, perhaps more accurately, preparing for reinventions. For buying the diet book, drawing up the new morning routine, bookmarking the therapists’ websites or purchasing the storage cabinets for the soon-to-be-perfectly-organised house. As with all attempts at personal transformation, at new year or otherwise, this is the fun part. You get to experience all the excitement of becoming an entirely different person, without having yet had to put in the effort – and without having failed. Like untrodden early morning snow, the vision of who you’ll become remains pristine. Usually, though, something inside you knows the truth: in a few days’ time, the whole thing will have turned into unpleasant grey slush. Personal reinventions fail partly for the obvious reasons: you set your goals too high; or your existing obligations at work or home get in the way; or you find (who could have imagined it?) that the unimpressive level of self-discipline you’ve demonstrated for your entire life until this moment can’t magically be tripled overnight. But there’s also a deeper problem with quests for wholesale transformation, which explains why they rarely work as intended – and why, as 2022 begins, embracing the existing version of yourself, with all its messiness and imperfections, might be the most transformative thing you’ve ever done.  The core of the trouble is that schemes for constructing a New You – whether in every area of life, or just one major one, such as your relationship with your children, or your physical fitness – are always devised by the Old You, who by their own admission has some pretty glaring issues. (Otherwise why would you bother to envision a new one?) You’ve got no good reason to trust this dubious character’s thoughts about reinvention; indeed, it’s likely they’re using what looks like “reinvention” to reinforce old hang-ups instead. And so, for example, your vow to become more productive this year might just stem from your old belief that you’re obliged to fulfil every demand made by those around you, when a better way forward might be to start strategically letting a few people down. Likewise, your intention to make this the year you find your soulmate might simply represent your conviction that you don’t have what it takes to cope on your own. Even if it works, the so-called reinvention will only end up entrenching the status quo. “No one awakens in the morning, looks in the mirror and says, ‘I think I will repeat my mistakes today’ or, ‘I expect today I will do something stupid, repetitive, regressive and against my best interests,’” writes the Jungian psychoanalyst James Hollis. “But frequently, this replication of history is precisely what we do.” One consequence is that while you’ll fail to pull off a total transformation of your personality – that would entail the impossible feat of somehow jumping outside your own life – you probably will end up feeling worse about the life you have. “Focusing your mind on an imagined future where you’re someone different makes your now-self inevitably ‘less-than’,” says Jocelyn K Glei, host of the Hurry Slowly podcast, who recommends using the new year to take stock of the preceding year’s transformations instead. The alternative to reinvention – making a wholehearted commitment to accepting who you already are – is liable to sound horribly cheesy, or at best like a matter of settling for a mediocre life. But as the celebrated psychologist Carl Rogers famously noted, the very opposite is the case: “The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change.” When you no longer imagine you must transform yourself, in order to justify your existence on the planet, you’re finally able to do so, in small ways and large. The stakes are lower, now that your self-worth no longer hangs in the balance. “There’s a quiet power in forgiving our flaws, missteps and perceived shortcomings,” says Madeleine Dore, author of I Didn’t Do the Thing Today: Letting Go of Productivity Guilt, out this month. “Often when we accept ourselves, we’re more likely to get the best from ourselves, because we’re better placed to look at what we need to thrive, rather than change.” The psychotherapist Bruce Tift suggests a thought experiment: imagine whatever issue you struggle with now – the trait in yourself you wish you didn’t possess, the behaviour in which you wish you didn’t engage – persisting to the very end of your days. What if you’ll always be something of a procrastinator? What if you never entirely lose your tendency to lash out at others when upset at yourself? When I run this experiment on myself, I feel deflated at first. Hold on – you mean I’ll never get to the part of life that’s problem-free? But then comes a sense of a burden being lifted. What a relief: I get to drop that stupid fantasy and focus on the real world, which is where real changes can happen. The self-help writer Mark Manson describes how this might work in the context of social anxiety: “Paradoxically, accepting that you’re just not a confident person and you’re always going to feel a little off around other people will begin to make you feel more comfortable and less anxious around others. You won’t judge yourself, and then you’ll feel less judged by them as well.” There’s a kind of defeat that needs accepting here: a willingness to concede that, by the perfectionistic standards to which you’ve been holding yourself, you have already failed. There’s no going back. You’ll never unwaste the time you tell yourself you’ve wasted, or undo the bad things you’ve done. Which is great, because it means you get to stop trying to evade the unavoidable mess of existence and get stuck in to a few worthwhile and pleasurable activities instead. The Zen teacher Shunryu Suzuki nailed the matter when he told his students: “Each of you is perfect just as you are – and you could all use improvement.” Yes, it’s a paradox. You’ll just have to deal with that, too.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"New year, same old you! The secret to self-improvement is embracing your messy, imperfect life",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/01/new-year-same-old-you-the-secret-to-self-improvement-is-embracing-your-messy-imperfect-life
1/1/2022,"The start of a new year always makes one feel inclined to do something new, whether it’s taking up knitting, committing to a workout regime or, for the more ambitious among us, making a film. In a suitable spirit of beginnings, Mubi annually serves this impulse with its First Films First series of essential debut features by major film-makers – though most of them, admittedly, don’t inspire a surge of hopeful “I could do that” confidence. Mubi’s debut selections this year are a formidable bunch, beginning with their admittedly pretty downbeat New Year’s Day pick, Andrea Arnold’s sharp, lean, unshakable revenge drama Red Road (2006), which set the tone for one of the great sensory film-making careers in British cinema. That’s followed up with Roy Andersson’s A Swedish Love Story, a gentle, tender coming-of-age romance from 1970, drawing inspiration from the likes of Miloš Forman, that you’d scarcely recognise as the work of the man latterly known for his arch absurdist formalism.  Other highlights from the Mubi lineup include Chadian director Mahamat-Saleh Haroun’s lively, Godard-referencing docudrama Bye Bye Africa (1999), built around a fictionalised version of the director himself; Lucile Hadžihalilović’s La bouche de Jean-Pierre (1996), with its vivid, unnerving evocation of teenage trauma and abuse; and British film-maker Daniel Kokotajlo’s vastly moving Apostasy (2017), about a family riven by Jehovah’s Witness law. It’s a very fine group of films, though it does rather create the impression that directors can only start their careers by plunging into the heart of despair. To carry the theme beyond Mubi’s mini festival, then, there are more comforting debut features to be found among Hollywood classics – none perkier than the ever-cheering sailors-on-leave musical On the Town (1949; Amazon), which gave both Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly their first directorial credit. The 1940s also gave us the most celebrated and prodigious debut film of all time: even if you don’t subscribe to the enduring awe surrounding Orson Welles’s Citizen Kane (1941; BBC iPlayer), you’d be hard-pressed to find many first features executed on such a robustly ambitious scale. From the same year, you hear less talk about John Huston’s immortal noir The Maltese Falcon being among the great debuts – only because it’s so supremely hardboiled, you assume he’d been directing for aeons. Mid-century New Wave auteurs had an eerie habit of debuting with films fully formed in aesthetic and outlook: take the French pair of Agnès Varda’s fierce, precise La Pointe Courte (1955; Curzon) and Jean-Luc Godard’s still radical, still jazz-cool Breathless (1960; BFI Player), for example. Over in Italy, Luchino Visconti arrived in the sparest, most ruthless form of his career with Ossessione (1943; Amazon); the recently departed Lina Wertmüller began with clear-eyed sociopolitical observation in her lovely 1963 debut The Basilisks (Amazon). John Cassavetes didn’t just arrive, but announced a whole new form of independent cinema with his wrenching Shadows (1959; Amazon), just as Ken Loach did for British realism a decade later in the potent, anti-swinging 60s snapshot Poor Cow (1967; BFI Player), while Steven Soderbergh rewrote the Cassavetes indie playbook three decades later in his pithy, witty sex, lies, and videotape (1989; Apple TV). In my lifetime, few debuts have announced a major directorial career as tellingly and evocatively as Claire Denis’s sensuous, post-colonial reflection Chocolat (1988; BFI Player), Quentin Tarantino’s bloody, chatty, nasty shoot-’em-down Reservoir Dogs (1992; Amazon) or Jordan Peele’s ghoulishly funny race-hate horror Get Out (2017; Google Play). I can only hope that some of my favourite recent debuts, including Maggie Gyllenhaal’s knotty psychodrama The Lost Daughter (2021; now on Netflix) and Serbian director Milica Tomović’s raucous, politically inflected farce Celts (2021; Google Play), lead to similarly sustained greatness. Malignant(Warner Bros)James Wan’s utterly unhinged, reality-blurring horror film died a swift death in cinemas last year, but a cult following has been quick to form, cheered on by kitsch-loving critics – not surprising for a genuinely eccentric, spirited film that rejects studio genre formula. Venom: Let There Be Carnage(Sony)Speaking of eccentric studio genre fare, 2018’s Venom was both deliriously stupid and a refreshingly loose-limbed deviation from stiffly moralistic superhero tradition. Andy Serkis’s sequel is, if anything, even more so, with the actor-film-maker unsurprisingly giving free rein to Tom Hardy’s loopy, physically immersed performance of a hybrid human-alien vigilante. Sure, why not? In the Realm of the Senses(Sony)The Criterion Collection welcomes Japanese film-maker Nagisa Oshima’s once controversial, still nervy 1976 erotic drama to its ranks. This glittering, high-definition transfer has the usual array of extras, though the film’s frank, upsetting study of obsessive, escalating power plays between a hotel maid and her abusive boss speaks for itself, passing barely perceptibly from transcendent beauty to stomach-churning violence.",Arts/Film,Streaming: Mubi’s First Films season and other essential director debuts,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/01/streaming-mubi-first-films-season-and-other-essential-director-debuts
1/1/2022,"Mikel Arteta is eager to fine-tune a squad that looks increasingly capable of a top-four push but may have to wheel and deal. He would like to address a lack of depth in midfield, perhaps using the sale of Ainsley Maitland-Niles to part-fund any signing, while Nicolas Pépé’s future is uncertain so a right-sided forward may be on the agenda. Arsenal need a new long-term option at centre-forward, too, but even if Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is frozen out for good that is likelier to be addressed in the summer. Budget Will be sales-dependent but could reach £30m. Nick Ames  Steven Gerrard is expected to be backed in his first window in charge. A defensive-minded midfielder is high on Gerrard’s wishlist after Marvelous Nakamba suffered a knee injury which may rule him out for the rest of the season, while reinforcements at full-back are also wanted. The Southampton midfielder Oriol Romeu was tracked in the summer, as was his club-mate, James Ward-Prowse. Villa have been linked with moves for the Liverpool defender Joe Gomez, and Glen Kamara, who excelled under Gerrard at Rangers. Budget Around £30m. Ben Fisher The Bees’ squad depth has been tested to the limit by injuries and, even though relegation looks unlikely, they have been exposed at times. Thomas Frank would like to sign a right wing-back, although he appears to have missed out on the Monaco-bound Brazilian Vanderson. Goalkeeping cover for the injured David Raya and competition for the strike duo of Ivan Toney and Bryan Mbeumo could also come into consideration. Some squad players could depart on loan. Budget Around £20m should secure them the calibre of players they need. NA Another striker who could lighten the load on Neal Maupay’s shoulders has remained elusive but Graham Potter will know that if he can find one then it could make all the difference. Brighton welcomed back Danny Welbeck from his injury layoff as they ended their winless run against Brentford on Boxing Day and have been linked with a £20m move for Blackburn’s Ben Brereton Díaz in January. They may face some competition given the Chile international’s goalscoring record so this season but with several key players coming back from injury, Potter is likely to be able to concentrate his resources on his main targets. Budget Around £20m. Ed Aarons As with any side in relegation trouble, Burnley will be keen to add to their brittle squad. Sean Dyche has spoken to the owners about bringing in some new faces. Scoring has been an issue, so a striker and added creativity are the areas the club plan to target. Summer signing Maxwel Cornet – their biggest attacking threat – is off to the Africa Cup of Nations, making the matter far more urgent for the club, as they rely heavily on him. Budget They do not work to specific numbers but it is safe to say there is money to spend on requisite signings. Will Unwin Much depends on whether Ben Chilwell makes a quick recovery from the knee injury he sustained against Juventus in November. Chilwell needs surgery and they could go into the market if the left wing-back is ruled out for the season. Everton’s Lucas Digne is an option. Meanwhile Thomas Tuchel could revive his interest in the Sevilla centre-back, Jules Koundé, and there could be a move for the Monaco midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni. Budget Tuchel should have funds given that Chelsea missed out on Kounde last summer. Jacob Steinberg A busy summer window that saw Palace strengthen their squad in several departments means that it’s unlikely to be a busy window for Patrick Vieira and co. The Frenchman has insisted that despite the absence of Wilfried Zaha, Cheikhou Kouyaté and Wilfried Zaha for the Africa Cup of Nations he is only interested in signing players who can improve his side. They have been linked with Roma forward Borja Mayoral and Napoli midfielder André-Frank Zambo Anguissa, although both may be out of reach for now. Budget Funds in place if the right player becomes available. EA There is a pressing need for Everton to act swiftly and successfully in this transfer window with the squad’s weaknesses exposed regularly and criticism of the club’s direction under Farhad Moshiri mounting. Rafael Benítez, who spent merely £1.7m in his first window as manager, wants to strengthen in both full-back positions – Dynamo Kiev left-back Vitaliy Mykolenko and Rangers’ right-back Nathan Patterson are targets – while a central midfielder, possibly Newcastle’s Sean Longstaff, is also on his wishlist. Budget “I think we will have some money to spend but I don’t think that will be too much,” said Benítez, whose budget could be shaped by whether Lucas Digne stays or leaves. Andy Hunter Marcelo Bielsa’s budget is said to be “tight”, but the Leeds manager has always preferred to work with a relatively small nucleus of senior professionals. Injuries to, among others, Patrick Bamford and Kalvin Phillips this season have suggested that he might have taken this policy too far and, with relegation now a real danger, some spending is expected. The Reading central midfielder John Swift is one target, but another striker is also required. Ditto an extra defender. Budget Might stretch to £20m. Louise Taylor Brendan Rodgers hopes good news is on the horizon, with a raft of key players set to return to fitness in the coming weeks, lessening the need to strengthen defensively this window. Rodgers is hopeful of having Caglar Soyuncu and Jonny Evans back before the end of the month, while James Justin and Wesley Fofana are into the final stages of their rehab. A shopping spree is off the menu but no club in the division is likely to have more players at the Africa Cup of Nations, with at least four players set for duty. Budget Around £10m. BF Stellar names continue to be linked with Anfield but, as previous windows have demonstrated, Jürgen Klopp is reluctant to buy in January unless a golden opportunity (Virgil van Dijk) or a bargain (Takumi Minamino) presents itself. Last year he broke with the habit of avoiding short-term measures to sign Ozan Kabak and Ben Davies on deadline day, only to discover better solutions to a defensive crisis under his nose in Nat Phillips and Rhys Williams. The Africa Cup of Nations will stretch resources up front although Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané will potentially miss only two Premier League games. Budget Liverpool made a profit on transfers in the summer, underlining how stringently the club is operating in Covid times and while building a new stand on Anfield Road. AH Ferran Torres has joined Barcelona but this may be Manchester City’s only major piece of business as Pep Guardiola’s wish to sign a No 9 appears one to be revisited in the summer window. A glance at the Premier League table shows why: the champions lead as they continue to be a formidable force. Guardiola’s is a close-to-perfect squad. Budget £100m-plus but likely to be kept until the summer. Jamie Jackson A central midfielder of Declan Rice’s quality remains the No 1 target but Ralf Rangnick’s hopes of landing the West Ham player or AN Other in this window appears remote. A centre-back who can challenge Raphaël Varane, Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof is the next priority but, again, this may have to wait until the close season. The interim manager has green-lit Anthony Martial’s desire to leave so the forward may do so in January – possibly on loan. Budget £50-100m. JJ Talk about a paradox. Newcastle may be the world’s richest club but they are also in acute relegation peril and, accordingly, not the most attractive destination for top talent. While reinforcing the defence – where Atlético Madrid’s Kieran Trippier and Lille’s Sven Botman rank among the assorted targets – remains Eddie Howe’s priority, central midfield also requires bolstering. Fresh injuries to his two best players, Allan Saint-Maximin and Callum Wilson, have made frontline recruitment another unexpected imperative. Budget Financial fair play rules would allow Newcastle to spend up to £200m. LT There is hardly a position on the pitch where Norwich could not do with reinforcement. Only at centre half, where City have five first-team options, are there the requisite numbers, but with 31 goals conceded it’s hard to argue there isn’t room for improvement there too. The need is greatest in attack where Norwich have scored only eight times in 18 games, but the club’s sporting director, Stuart Webber, has made clear that manager Dean Smith will not have money to spend unless players leave. Max Aarons, the subject of interest from Tottenham and Everton, is the most saleable asset. Budget £5m maximum. Paul MacInnes Ralph Hasenhüttl is relaxed after adding greater depth to his squad in the summer, but the Saints could look to utilise the one permitted loan spot they have left. They could also try to replicate the success they have had with teenage sensation Tino Livramento, a £5m pickup from Chelsea, by luring a youngster from a rival with the carrot of first-team opportunities. They have a decision to make over whether to extend 40-year-old goalkeeper Willy Caballero’s deal beyond January. “I’m not a big friend of transfers in the January window,” Hasenhüttl says. Budget Around £5m. BF Antonio Conte wants a centre-half and someone for the right flank but he knows that, even though Daniel Levy says he will always back him for the right player, sales will be vital to the extent of that backing. Virtually everybody in the squad has his price and the key question will be whether they are realistic – with particular focus on those for Joe Rodon, Steven Bergwijn, Harry Winks and Dele Alli. Budget Levy could stump up £20m-£25m. On the other hand, he could not and it will be largely sell-to-buy. David Hytner The only top-flight team yet to keep a clean sheet, Watford will at the very minimum seek to strengthen the centre of their defence this month, while with the summer gamble on Danny Rose having apparently failed a left-back would also be useful. The Hornets rarely spend heavily on defenders and January is not usually a time for bargains, so loan moves – Sead Kolasinac has been linked – might be preferred. Budget Limited while relegation remains a threat – perhaps £10m. Simon Burnton West Ham desperately need a new centre-back after losing Angelo Ogbonna and Kurt Zouma to serious injuries. Liverpool’s Nat Phillips, Bournemouth’s Lloyd Kelly and Burnley’s James Tarkowski have been targeted by David Moyes, who needs strong backing from the board. West Ham’s squad looks stretched and they would also like reinforcements in attack. Manchester United’s Jesse Lingard is still on their wishlist and Moyes likes the Blackburn striker, Ben Brereton Díaz. Links with Sparta Prague’s Adam Hlozek also refuse to go away. Budget Could be as much as £30m following Daniel Kretinsky’s arrival on the board. JS A low-key window is likely, with no major incomings expected. Wolves could recall Rúben Vinagre and Dion Sanderson from loans to cover for the Morocco defender Romain Saïss heading to the Africa Cup of Nations and give Bruno Lage a chance to cast his eye over his options. Going forward, Wolves are set to be boosted by the returns of Jonny, Pedro Neto and Hwang Hee-chan from injury before the end of January. Rúben Neves and Adama Traoré have admirers but it is difficult to envisage Wolves sanctioning sales unless clubs offer silly money. Budget Up to £10m.

Russia mounts some kind of incursion in eastern Ukraine. China waits for an opportune moment to overrun Taiwan. And the world runs out of Greek letters to attach to Covid variants.  Yes, it’s the time for pundits and predictions – a new year stretching ahead and no shortage of views on what it will deliver.

But what about the unknown unknowns? We asked the Guardian’s 1 million supporters to make their predictions. The picture painted by a colourful spray of submissions was an alternative foretelling of the year ahead – and not hugely cheerful. Geopolitically, Ukraine and Taiwan seem most vulnerable, but there were also predictions of showdowns in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ethiopia and Iran, of something stirring on Russia’s border with the Baltic republics, and of deepening hunger in Afghanistan and parts of sub-Saharan Africa.

An incipient desertion of Facebook and Twitter becomes a proper exodus; cryptocurrencies collapse in value faced with the twin threats of regulation and the issue of official digital currencies. Airports, supermarkets and lampposts become EV charging hubs. Gigabattery is voted word of the year, just ahead of microbiome, plyscraper, nanodrone and wolf warrior. There will be digital daemons for all. Rain patterns change and there are further startling weather events in unexpected parts. A cyberattack causes major infrastructure disruption. Billions of trees are planted, but not all of them in the right places. Horses are increasingly used as a method of transport. Assisted dying becomes bigger business than ever, as planned death becomes something of a performance. There is a backlash against the availability of online pornography as a new social division emerges between sybarites and prudes. Fertility rates plummet amid a crisis over sperm counts. Overall, it will be a marginally better year than 2021. A survey of supporters found 50.5% optimistic about the new year, compared with 49.5% who were pessimistic. Europe will be facing two tricky crises: the refugee situation in Belarus and newly sparked tensions in Serbia, both potential candidates for another war in Europe. Extreme civil unrest due to the harsh Covid restrictions imposed by the governments. War between the US and China over Taiwan. Christine Brösenhuber Horses will begin to be used for travel and will appear in towns and cities. To enable this to happen, horse parks will be provided where owners can safely leave their horses while they pop to the shops, go to work, nip to the GP ... Horses run on grass – it makes so much sense. Penny Nicholson Prediction of a repeat of the 1920s following the Spanish flu pandemic ... if it is correct it will result in increase in social disease, alcoholism and drug taking ... others much more relaxed will reap the benefits of an alternate life Covid-19 allowed them to see. Elaine Hasty You’ll be able to personalise the sound of your electric car and the streets will become a cacophony of Clash meets Tchaikovsky. You’ll be able to select your own online daemon to accompany you to online office meetings: it will sit in the corner of your screen and scratch, titter, scowl, chuck pips etc while you nod seriously at your boss. Insects will be the new crisps, until people realise how gross insect farming is. Coralie Wilson We’ll start to see a more purpose-orientated approach in business and in working life. The “great resignation” has encouraged many people to seek out work that feels personally meaningful to them, and I expect this trend will continue in 2022. As employees start to realign their working lives around a sense of personal meaning, it will eventually become clear to employers that purpose is a priority. This will encourage business owners and leaders to take a more intentional approach to strategy and management, figuring out what they can offer their employees and stakeholders, and working to make a meaningful impact in the world. Eloise Skinner Enough people will leave Facebook and Twitter to make them unviable. Nick Jones There will be bigger splits across society with those vaccinated v anti-vaxxers. This will lead to further disinformation and probably further violence and inequalities across society especially where compulsory vaccines are introduced. Gerry Lee Macron will be re-elected. A definite 55% of Scottish yes for independence. A fourth dose of vaccine starting in May. The relationship between France and the UK will turn even sourer. Anna-Laure Damongeot I see two major universal trends. The first that one half of the population of human beings of this world will evolve into a kinder and more generous species, grateful to have survived the worst existential crisis in our recent history. The other half, which has sunk into an alternative reality of viewing fellow people as enemies of their race, will have a rude awakening and lose considerable ground because their own clans will desert them even as their predictions keep getting exposed as hate and not facts. Aruna Hariharan A growing youth movement of authentic and knowledgeable activists who demand transformative change in our governance systems. Steve Martin ​​Sinn Féin/Alliance form Northern Ireland government at Stormont in May causing civil war in the Conservative party as their negotiating stance on the NI protocol with Europe collapses. Further Brexit issues with border controls and supply chain problems ramp up the pressure on Johnson. He does not rise to the challenge and further infighting results in a leadership challenge. Paul Collins Julian Assange freed and allowed to return to Australia with his wife and two sons. Mariam Dessaive I predict that Boris will further seek to weasel his way out of No 10 because he doesn’t like being PM when it’s difficult. Kathy Duggan A major crypto crash, perhaps because of regulatory crackdowns and/or the introduction of one or more official digital currencies. Geoff Barnard A significant decline of the far right in many countries. A bigger “normality” of our lives facing Covid-19 (vaccination and weaker variants). A more severe crisis between western countries and China and Russia. Luiz Bastos I think that countries where there’s no free speech, a lot of corruption, poverty and very high Covid deaths will face big trouble (India, Egypt, Iran, even maybe Russia and China), if not in 2022 then in the next 10 years. Erika Claus Petiot Due to political embarrassment of stories of exploitation of overseas workers in Qatar, Fifa moves World Cup location to the more sensitive choice of Saudi Arabia, only after Belarus turned down the opportunity. Patrick Brosnan With four major Covid-19 variants in two years we can expect another two in 2022. Could be more with the lack of take-up of vaccines worldwide. Eventually, we’ll run out of Greek letters. Dave Bartlett There will be a series of scandals of older vulnerable people coming to significant harm as a result of the lack of social care availability. Peter Loose We’ll all move to the Orkneys to soak up the surplus electricity. As a result there will be a run on warm clothing especially puffer jackets. As a result of that the eider duck population will crash. Jane Edmonds While the west is distracted by further Covid outbreaks, Russia invades Ukraine and China attacks Taiwan – simultaneously. The west subsequently does not know which way to turn. George Stephens China will begin to take serious measures on climate emissions, and Australia and Canada’s fossil industries will suffer accordingly. Norm Mohamid There will be a major disruption caused either by a cyberattack or by failure of GPS – caused by a large solar storm or a system problem. We have become far too dependent on technology that is vulnerable to widespread failure. Martyn Thomas More people than ever will give up on the US and Canadian costs of living and move to Mexico and Panama. Suzanne Gravelle 2022 is going to be significantly worse even than 2021 and 2020. Large increases in the price of food, fuel, energy, hospitality. Maybe even food shortages. More extreme weather events, including more, and worse, in the UK. Terrifying clampdowns on freedom of speech and the right to protest – eg “protesters” being imprisoned for sharing views and communicating with each other online. And who knows what is going to happen with Covid? The shocking thing is that, even with 2020 and 2021 being as awful as they have been, they are better than any year we’ll see for the rest of our lives. Cathy Eastburn The Covid variants will have to be named in Sanskrit, after we run out of Greek letters. Mike Allen I hate to say this, but there will be an increase in tensions over the Ukraine, Taiwan, and Iran’s nuclear programme. This will not be triumph of the west. The US will retreat from these facedown, and Ukraine will fall into the orbit of Russia, Taiwan will fall to China, without a fight, at the early signs of invasion, and Iran will find itself on the receiving end of Israeli attacks on its nuclear programme. Whether it retaliates effectively, along with its allies Hezbollah and to a lesser extant Hamas, will determine Israel’s fate. The 2022 elections in the US will lead to a return to Republican majorities in both ouses.

1/1/2022," Luck plays a big part in politics and the shadow chancellor took full advantage of her good fortune when Keir Starmer tested positive for Covid just before the October 2021 budget. According to parliamentary tradition, the leader of the opposition responds to the chancellor’s budget speech, but Starmer’s absence meant Reeves stepped in and, by general consent, delivered a polished reply to Rishi Sunak. No single speech, no matter how widely praised, will be enough to revive Labour’s fortunes after four successive election defeats, and 2022 will be a crucial year for the party and for Reeves. Although the government has been floundering, the message from byelections, opinion polls and focus groups is that the public still have their doubts about Labour. The former Bank of England economist’s task as shadow chancellor is to come up with an approach to running the economy that is radical enough to be eye-catching yet also reassuring. She will need to do more than attack the Tories for higher taxes and rising inflation: she will need to start fleshing out Labour’s alternative. Larry Elliott The task facing the World Trade Organization’s director general over the next 12 months is simple: to save it from irrelevance or – even worse – from falling apart completely, When Okonjo-Iweala was appointed last year, much was made of her being the first woman and first African in the role, but it was her reputation as a political operator that decided the contest in her favour. She will need skills honed as finance minister in her native Nigeria and during 25 years spent at the World Bank to navigate her way through three big issues facing the WTO. The immediate task is to find agreement to waive patent rights on Covid vaccines so that developing countries can produce their own treatments for the pandemic. Success there would enhance Okonjo-Iweala’s reputation as a political fixer and give her a better chance of resolving two longer-running issues. When it was created in 1995, the WTO had two core functions: to deliver multilateral trade deals and to settle trade disputes between member states. For the past few years it has struggled to do either under a succession of technocratic leaders. The next year will show whether Okonjo-Iweala can do better. LE When she was selected to succeed Christine Lagarde as the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Georgieva was seen as a safe pair of hands, but it hasn’t quite turned out that way. She has become the latest occupant of her office to be afflicted by the curse of Washington’s 19th Street, the home of the IMF. Like Lagarde and her predecessor, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Georgieva has been touched by scandal and only just clung on to her job last year. The row over whether she tampered with a report to give a more favourable impression of China during her previous job at the World Bank was a distraction the IMF could have done without as it sought to deal with the economic fallout from the pandemic. A slowing global recovery, upward pressure on inflation caused by supply bottlenecks, the threat of financial crisis in two of the bigger middle-income countries – Turkey and Argentina – and the buildup of worrying levels of debt in many low-income states are all pressing issues. Georgieva will have her hands full in 2022 and must show she has put her personal troubles behind her. LE The chief executive of GSK was masterminding a bold revamp of Britain’s second-biggest drugmaker when the New York activist hedge fund Elliott Management emerged on the shareholder register in April. Since then, Elliott has kept Walmsley – a former L’Oréal executive who took the helm at GSK in spring 2017 – on her toes. GSK has firmly resisted the hedge fund’s public demands that she reapply for her job before the demerger of its consumer healthcare division planned for the middle of next year. Walmsley has stuck to her plans, and has received a boost lately from a spate of good news. GSK’s long-acting HIV treatment Vocabria, which replaces daily tablets with an injection every two months, was last month recommended by the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which decides which drugs are available on the NHS. The company has also agreed a $1bn (£740m) contract with the US government to provide its Covid-19 treatment Sotrovimab, which has been shown to reduce hospitalisation and deaths by 79%. Yet Walmsley probably needs more successes in the drugs pipeline to keep Elliott at bay and to prove to other investors that GSK’s turnaround is under way. It will be a tense six months until the split of the business is complete. Julia Kollewe The chair of the John Lewis Partnership has been in her post for less than two years but has already caused quite a stir. The former Ofcom boss has already closed 16 loss-making John Lewis branches, including major Birmingham and Sheffield outlets, cut thousands of jobs and shelved the annual staff bonus for 2020. The staff-owned enterprise’s “partners” are now waiting to see if that bonus can be restored through stronger online sales and new avenues of business including financial services, building homes for rent above some stores and widening distribution with outlets on local high streets. White is betting that retail alone will not deliver the kind of profit margins capable of keeping staff well remunerated, but there is a fear that her team’s new ideas are riskier bets than shops and could be a distraction. Meanwhile, back at the retail coalface there are plenty of challenges ahead. John Lewis, under attack from cheaper rivals, is expected to ditch the brand’s “never knowingly undersold” policy – a key part of its pitch to shoppers for almost a century. It’s not clear how shoppers will react. The first step towards that aim was the introduction of the cheaper Anyday range, which some see as a misstep downmarket and others as vital in recalibrating its image for younger shoppers. Waitrose is also facing tricky times. Having cut ties with the online specialist Ocado, giving new life to Marks & Spencer, the supermarket faces a battalion of cheaper rivals during a period of high inflation. Finding cash to expand its newly independent online business could be a challenge. Sarah Butler The chief executive of Channel 4 faces the biggest challenge of her tenure this year when the government’s push to privatise the broadcaster comes to a head. Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, will publish her final decision on whether to sell off Channel 4 in the new year, dampening its 40th anniversary of being set up as a publicly owned, commercially funded alternative to the BBC and ITV. Mahon has her work cut out to fend off what looks to be a political fait accompli, despite widespread criticism that any new owner would have to make large cuts to its programming budget and scrap much of its commercially unattractive content to boost profits. But Mahon may yet win the day, with Channel 4 having survived about half a dozen attempts to push the privatisation agenda over the years. The most serious came under David Cameron’s government in 2016. Against what seemed insurmountable odds the broadcaster survived, with the government able to save face in a “levelling up” deal that has resulted in significant operations and more than a third of staff moving out of London, as well as the opening of a new national headquarters in Leeds and creative hubs in Bristol and Glasgow. Mahon appears to have no such sweeping strategy changes to offer that might appease ministers this time around. However, with mounting opposition from TV producers in the nations and regions arguing that privatisation is diametrically opposed to the government’s agenda of spreading wealth across the country, the battle is not over yet. Mark Sweney Crosbie has become a dominant figure in the mid-tier banking sector, becoming the first woman to lead for two major UK institutions: TSB and, in 2022, the UK’s largest mutual lender, Nationwide. She joined TSB in 2019 from the Clydesdale Bank owner CYBG – since rebranded as Virgin Money – where she had worked for more than 20 years, becoming its chief operating officer in 2015. Crosbie since led a turnaround at TSB, after an IT meltdown in 2018 that left 1.9 million customers locked out of their accounts tarnished the bank’s reputation and led to the ousting of her predecessor, Paul Pester. During her tenure, Crosbie has cut nearly 1,000 jobs and shut nearly half of branches as part of a gruelling restructuring programme. But after three years at the helm, Crosbie leaves TSB in good stead, having led the bank back to a profit in the half year to June. She is due to replace Joe Garner as chief executive of the Nationwide building society in the first half of 2022. She joins a small cadre of female bosses in the City, which is still grappling with a male-dominated sector where men make up about 70% of senior management positions, according to the Women in Finance Charter’s latest annual review. Kalyeena Makortoff The appointment of the Indian-born executive as CEO of the luxury brand Chanel in December was greeted as a sign of much-needed diversity coming to fashion. The hope is that Nair’s appointment will provide an example for other brands in the industry. Nair moves to Chanel from Unilever where she was used to firsts – she was the company’s first Asian, first female and youngest ever chief HR officer. She will have challenges at Chanel, a private company that has been owned by the same family since the 1920s. Nair will take over from Alain Wertheimer, the grandson of Pierre who originally invested in Chanel. Wertheimer will remain involved as global chair. Nair will face problems familiar across fashion: the pandemic led to sales at Chanel falling by 18% in 2020. While the company rallied, with revenue growing in the first half of this year, she will want to keep that trajectory up in 2022. Some of her focus will undoubtedly be on Chanel’s workforce. Speaking to Time in 2021, she said: “Human capital is as important as financial capital.” At Unilever, Nair oversaw about 150,000 people in 190 countriesand worked on its diversity and inclusion programme. Last year it was announced that Unilever was gender balanced at management level globally.

1/1/2022,"Simultaneous exhibitions to mark the 60th anniversary of Yves Saint Laurent’s first collection are to be held by six leading Paris museums in an unprecedented tribute from the art world to the late French fashion designer. The events at museums, among them the Louvre and the Musée d’Orsay, will reveal how the celebrated couturier was inspired by some of the 20th century’s greatest artists including Picasso, Matisse and Mondrian.  Mouna Mekouar, who curated the multi-centre event that will feature the designer’s work placed in the context of each establishment’s permanent collections, said the participation of some of France’s largest and most renowned museums was unprecedented. “I thought it would be impossible to get so many museums to agree to our idea, but they were all very interested and hugely enthusiastic from the beginning. It is the first time they have all worked together on one project,” Mekouar said. “Saint Laurent was very much inspired by art and this shows the links and dialogue between his work and the museum exhibits. We didn’t want to put the clothes in a room, we wanted them there among the permanent collections. “In this way visitors will rediscover those collections at the same time as paying homage to Yves Saint Laurent. It’s like a cultural archipelago.” Saint Laurent, who died in 2008 aged 71, was just 26 when he founded his haute couture house with the businessman Pierre Bergé in December 1961. He had moved to Paris nine years previously where his designs quickly gained notice and he was introduced to Christian Dior, then a giant in the fashion world. Yves Saint Laurent presented his first haute couture show on 29 January 1962. “I believe the work of a couturier is very much like that of an artist. In fact, I have constantly found inspiration in the work of contemporary painters: Picasso, Matisse, Mondrian,” Saint Laurent said later. “Always influenced by painting, I owe my July 1966 collection to American painters like Wesselman, Roy Lichtenstein. All my dresses were lit with landscapes, moons and sunlight,” he added. “How could I resist pop art that was the expression of my youth.” The six museums taking part in Yves Saint Laurent Aux Musées, which runs from 29 January to 15 May, are the Centre Pompidou, the Musée d’Art Moderne de Paris, the Musée du Louvre, Musée d’Orsay, Musée Picasso and the Musée Yves Saint Laurent. Each will feature different aspects of Saint Laurent’s work. At the Louvre there will be some of his most exceptional garments, including jackets embroidered with gold and crystals. At the Musée d’Art Moderne de Paris, Saint Laurent designs will echo the colours of the artists Pierre Bonnard and Raoul Dufy. The Musée d’Orsay will feature some of the evening wear he created for the Proust Ball to mark the 100th birthday of the writer whose guests dressed by Saint Laurent included Baron Guy de Rothschild and Jane Birkin. A total of 50 Saint Laurent creations will be on display as part of the exhibition as well as about 300 designs. At the Yves Saint Laurent museum, visitors will be taken through the creative process from sketch to finished garment. Mekouar spoke of the “dialogue” Saint Laurent created between “art and literature” and said the designer expressed “a whole artistic universe” through his creations. “It wasn’t just one collection but his whole life’s work that was linked to art. It’s about looking at Saint Laurent from the perspective of art. Both Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé were great collectors of art and this had a great influence on the fashion designs,” Mekouar said. “I think he would never had said he was an artist, but today with the links between art and fashion I think we can see Saint Laurent as a creative artist.” Madison Cox, an American garden designer who married Bergé shortly before the latter’s death in 2017 who is president of the Pierre Bergé – Yves Saint Laurent Foundation said the exhibition was an extraordinary showcase “of one of the greatest innovators of French fashion”. “For Yves Saint Laurent, the fine arts were an inexhaustible source of inspiration, embracing all cultures throughout history. This constant dialogue was a key element of the designer’s boundless ingenuity and creativity,” Cox wrote.",Lifestyle/Fashion,The art of Yves Saint Laurent: design house marks 60th anniversary,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/01/the-art-of-yves-saint-laurent-design-house-marks-60th-anniversary
1/1/2022,"The UK’s first specialist black bookshop is weighing up a move to new premises after a crowdfunding campaign to save it from closure raised £50,000 in just a few days. New Beacon Books was founded in 1966 and has been based in Stroud Green Road, north London, for all but one year of its existence.  It announced in December that it would be forced to close its physical store in Finsbury Park due to competition from online retailers and the effects of the Covid pandemic, prompting dismay at the potential loss of a “crucial cultural space”. Campaigners launched a crowdfunder in a bid to raise the cash to keep the shop open. Its £35,000 target was smashed within 48 hours. By Friday, more than £50,000 had been raised in support of the shop. New Beacon Books’ director, Michael La Rose, said this week that the shop may have to find new premises so that it can scale up its publishing arm to avoid going online only. “In order to meet its financial commitments, New Beacon Books must continue to do much more than just sell books,” he said in a statement. “The publishing arm … has been scaled down considerably, but there are increasing calls for New Beacon Publications to commission and publish work by young creatives and provide a forum for the exchange of ideas. “For New Beacon Books to do this, it must be able to make full use of its existing space and, if necessary, relocate to premises that will allow for the expansion of its publishing and public affairs programmes as well as for bookselling.” He added that an alternative premises may be needed “to accommodate publishing, bookselling, writers in residence [and] public programmes.” Francesca Gilbert, a campaigner who helped to organise the campaign, said: “The New Beacon bookshop exists as far more than just a bookshop. It is an invaluable institution of black history that is needed now more than ever. “It is a crucial cultural space rich with the affirmation, validation and celebration of black literature, culture and art that must be preserved.” She added: “As a young mixed-race Caribbean woman of colour, I never feel more affirmed and held than I do when I spend an afternoon at the New Beacon bookshop surrounded by the work of writers who uplift black voices and stories. It is a second home, a heartbeat and a legacy that we must protect now and in the years to come.”",Arts/Books,UK’s first black bookshop weighs move to new site after £50k raised to save it,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/01/uks-first-black-bookshop-weighs-move-to-new-site-after-50k-raised-to-save-it

Kate Wyver ComedyKatherine Ryan: Missus Charter Hall, Colchester; touring to 28 MayYou’re three weeks into the new year. Your resolution – and your resolutions – are fading. Who better to stiffen the resolve than swaggering Canadian comic Katherine Ryan, acknowledging no frailty whatsoever as she delivers a new set of will-to-power standup about new love, with her childhood sweetheart no less, after years of single motherhood. You can do it! She can, too! Enjoy! BL ArtTestament Goldsmiths CCA, London, to 3 AprilFrom Edward Colston’s statue being dumped in the river to demands to topple the hated colonialist Cecil Rhodes from his spot at Oriel College, Oxford, who we memorialise and how, is a red-hot issue. What then will 50 artists –from established luminaries such as Jeremy Deller and Phyllida Barlow to younger guns – make of an invitation to commemorate our conflicted moment? Tackling BLM, environmental breakdown, Covid and Brexit, the responses across painting, film, performance and sculpture will veer from campaigning to deeply personal. SS FilmBlack Film ArchiveTaking an intuitive and evolving approach to curation, writer Maya Cade’s Black Film Archive presents a catalogue of Black films made from 1915 to 1979, organised by decade and accompanied by contextual writing explaining their plot and significance. Streamable movies range from box-office successes such as Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, starring Sidney Poitier, to hidden gems like Welfare, a three-hour documentary on the US welfare system. AK MusicMahler’s Third Symphony Bridgewater Hall, ManchesterThe longest symphony in the repertoire, Mahler’s Third is also his most celebratory and positive, a hymn to nature, love and renewal, conceived on an epic scale. Performances are always a special event; this one comes from the Hallé Orchestra and its music director, Mark Elder, with Alice Coote as the mezzo-soprano soloist and the Hallé adult and children’s choirs. AC GameWeird West PC, PS4, XBox OneIf you cannot decide what sort of games you want to be playing in 2022, Weird West might be a good place to start. An overhead shooter set in a supernatural wild west, it has elements of role-playing games and stealth adventures, and its world is extremely reactive to player actions, so you carve out your own story. The developers previously worked on the classic titles Dishonored and Prey, so this promises to be a vibrant, exciting world to explore and interact with while you’re cosy at home. KS ArtGainsborough’s The Blue Boy The National Gallery, London, to 15 MayExactly 100 years after being sold to the US, Gainsborough’s The Blue Boy is back in the UK. Its loan to the National Gallery allows British viewers to reassess a maybe overfamiliar image that has gone on to play a role in modern gay politics and history as well as exerting a remarkable pull on popular culture more generally, from Cole Porter songs through to Batman and Tarantino movies. NW Brain foodKwantu Language ExchangeMade a new year’s resolution to learn a new language? Africa accounts for 30% of the world’s languages but only Swahili features on Duolingo. During lockdown, the Texas-based multilinguist and Kwantu founder Khanyisa Mnyaka set about fixing that. Her first offering is a six-week beginner’s course in conversational isiXhosa. Trying your tongue at the South African language’s sonorous clicks will explode your sense of phonetic possibility. DBS ArtRachel Feinstein Gagosian Davies Street, London, to 5 MarchAny post-Christmas examination of the feelings provoked by a period of excess would be aided by exposure to Feinstein’s paintings, sculptures and installations. Her meticulously detailed work often pits examples of opulence from art history – spiritual and secular in this new show – against 21st-century objects of taste and desire in an unsettling excavation of luxury and materialism. NW Theatre & MusicGhost Walk; Ghost QuartetFor Londoners who fancy some fresh air, try Poltergeist’s geo-located audio show Ghost Walk, for ages seven and over.

Recorded in 2015, the gentle, folk-infused performance is now available on YouTube. KW Book & TelevisionWays of Seeing turns 50John Berger’s book and TV series of the same name first emerged 50 years ago and opened up areas of academic cultural study to a mainstream audience, not least in addressing issues such as the sexist history of the nude and the links between art and advertising. It remains hugely influential, right up to Emily Ratajkowski’s recent modeling memoir My Body opening with a quote from it. The full series is available to watch online. NW PodcastTalking Simulator All platformsIf one of your new year’s resolutions is to understand a little more about how games are made, this podcast by the Gadget Show presenter and sometime Guardian contributor Jordan Erica Webber is a fine place to start. It is a series of short, interesting interviews with game designers, covering elements such as romance, esports, puzzles and even activism in games. If video is more your thing, the excellent People Make Games series on YouTube covers similar ground. KS ArtIda Applebroog, Right Up to Now, 1969–2021 Hauser & Wirth Somerset, Bruton, to 2 MayFeminist polymath Ida Applebroog was inspired by Beckett and shaped by the women’s movement, but the absurdist comic strip-style drawings that made her name are uniquely her own. Highlights here include her early skit on Galileo, reimagined as a headless chancer suppressing his daughter’s genius. The nonagenarian’s new composite abstract-figurative works continue her darkly funny, oblique explorations of power dynamics.

1/1/2022,"It’s 2017 and Sam, a middle-class, perimenopausal wife and mother living in Syracuse, NY, is maddened by America. Who wouldn’t be? The US is both terrifying and electrifying in its inventiveness. In this, her fifth novel, Dana Spiotta is prepared to itemise her crazy country’s collapse. If her data collection effort ultimately becomes an exercise in passivity, there are a few good “Whoa!” moments along the way. This is the first year of Donald Trump’s destabilising presidency. Innocence has been defiled. Unarmed Black teenagers are getting shot in the back by cops, don’t-mess-with-me gun ownership is the prevailing ideal, and everybody’s a tattletale. At the state fair, which previously seemed innocuous to Sam, even charming, she now encounters T-shirts for sale that say things like “LGBT (Liberty, Guns, Beer, Trump)”. Other slogans attack the liberally minded, now derided as “snowflakes”.  History is being obliterated, along with art, thought, justice, morality and landmark buildings. Sam seems almost alone in treasuring Arts and Crafts architecture and furniture, peeling paintwork and antique tiling, her daughter’s prepubescent years (now over), her mother’s perpetual love, the mid 19th-century Oneida community (exultantly adventurous about sex, but blemished by the practice of eugenics), and L Frank Baum, who gets off very lightly here despite his genocidal attitude to Native Americans. Dissatisfied with her fellow menopausal Trump-resisters – all sauvignon blanc, “landmine squats” and Hillary Clinton pantsuits – Sam leaves the comforts of suburbia for a solitary life in a crumbling house in downtown Syracuse that, like Sam herself, is “dirty, falling apart, empty too long”. There, she relishes the freedom to stay up all night, polish wooden floorboards and hardly ever eat. She even attends ghastly open-mic events at a local comedy club. She seems to be abandoning her self in order to study her society. Or she might just be unravelling. In place of old structures, sincerity and taste, online she discovers bizarre new allegiances that have emerged like fungi overnight, groups for this, groups for that. (For “group”, you could substitute “hatred”.) She meets a few of these networkers in person, but most of her investigations seem restricted to the stinky, stagnant pond of the internet, making the novel smell somewhat of the lamp. Still, many of Sam’s findings are plausibly excruciating. Some of the off-gridders Spiotta catalogues advocate survivalism, others are opposed to cosmetic surgery (yet make exceptions for stomach flab). There are witchcraft communities with sidelines in sundials, and lots of Christians and dieters (anti-vaxxers haven’t yet hatched). A clandestine sorority of ageing women, calling itself Hardcore Hags, Harridans and Harpies, is matched by another outfit: Men Going Their Own Way. Some renegades dress badly; others have superb teeth. Sam has pretty much left her real life behind, including a husband – good in bed but offputtingly dependent on post-workout amino acid and whey protein shakes – and their teenage daughter Ally, a straight-A student who’s into etymology, dating older men and bearing grudges against her mother. Given Sam’s obsessive attitude towards Ally, which has at times driven her to spy on her daughter’s online activities and fixate on her breasts, this is probably just as well. To focus on a middle-aged woman is still an enterprising novelistic task. Alas, the book is besotted with the kid. Why can’t an ageing female character exist on her own in a piece of fiction without being mirrored by a youthful one? Held in this Trumpian vice of desirability, the younger contender (except maybe in the case of Bette Davis in All About Eve, or Mrs Merdle in Little Dorrit) is pretty much bound to come out on top. Ally duly develops an air of moral superiority, but she and her mother are so similar in outlook, you really wonder why Spiotta felt she needed them both. It would have been better to concentrate on Sam’s psyche, which wavers oddly between bewildered and smartass. Is she even likable? “Sam hated her own shallowness” … so do we. While everybody in Syracuse runs more and more (as ordered by their personal trainers), Wayward plods along. It can get preachy and pedantic, too, and overly medical. Spiotta tussles valiantly with serious things – human nature, racial conflict, cancel culture, homelessness, road rage and feminism – without reaching firm conclusions. A fairly touching soliloquy on menstruation comes out of nowhere, then disappears as if ashamed of itself. Instead, the normally staid narrative approach, complete with loads of dutiful backgrounding and flurries of zeitgeist, makes this feel at times like an up-to-the-minute Anne Tyler novel. Spiotta’s analogy between the Trump presidency and the menopause is apt: both cause fatigue, anxiety, insomnia, sudden upsets, fury, revulsion, ostracism and a lot of sadness. But on second thoughts, this maligns the menopause, which can be a real liberation for women; Trump is only about terror. It’s clear men should not be running the world, but the wishy-washy women of Syracuse seem almost as untenable.  Lucy Ellmann’s Ducks, Newburyport is published by Galley Beggar.
