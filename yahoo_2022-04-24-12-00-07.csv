4/24/2022,"Earlier this week, 3-year-old Yaseem Jenkins, who was allegedly used as a “human shield” by his father during a 2019 shooting in Philadelphia, has died. Jenkins was 11 months old at the time of the shooting. Philadelphia district attorney Larry Krasner shared the tragic news during a news conference on Thursday, April 21. Krasner confirmed the toddler's death. “We are awaiting a medical examiner’s report on the cause of death, but we have reason to believe the cause of death is his original injury from that shooting,"" Krasner explained. On October 19, 2019, Nafes Monroe took his son with him to a drug deal with Francisco Ortiz, according to Anthony Voci Jr., the chief of the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Homicide Unit. In a news conference, Voci said that Monroe was using counterfeit money in the drug deal and believed that his son's presence would deter violence. ""It's our belief and our investigation has led us to believe that he intentionally had his child with him when he was making such types of purchases with the idea or belief that if someone saw that he had a child in the car, that they would not fire upon him,"" Voci said at the time. ""... A human shield is probably the term that I would use."" A police department spokesperson told NBC News that Yaseem sustained gunshot wounds to his head, torso and the rear of his body. Voci said that the child was not rushed to the hospital after the shooting and was instead driven to a house. The next month, Monroe was arrested in connection with the shooting and was charged with recklessly endangering another person and endangering the welfare of a child, according to Voci. According to court documents reviewed by TODAY, Monroe pled guilty on both charges. Krasner did not indicate whether Monroe would be charged in relation to his son's death. An attorney listed for Monroe in the 2019 plea was not immediately available for comment on Saturday morning. Ortiz was charged with attempted murder, aggravated assault, and related offenses, according to court documents reviewed by TODAY. According to the documents, he is awaiting a trial scheduled for June 2022 and has pled not guilty to the charges. Krasner said that Ortiz may also be charged with murder, pending information from the medical examiner investigating Yaseem's death. “Our office was already prepared for two separate trials involving the man we allege is responsible for shooting him ... If it should turn out that the medical examiner decides Yaseem’s untimely and unnatural death occurred as a direct result of his injuries from two years ago, we will be prepared to additionally charge Mr. Ortiz with murder,"" Krasner said. An attorney listed for Ortiz in the court documents was not immediately available for comment on Saturday. Krasner described the death as a “tough moment” after offering his condolences to the child’s family. He also confirmed that multiple units have been in contact with Yaseem’s family to offer support, including offering assistance with funeral expenses. “Yaseem fought long and hard to recover from his injuries while still being the strong happy kid he was but sadly lost the battle yesterday morning,” a GoFundMe organized on behalf of the family read.",U.S./TODAY,Family remember 3-year-old who died after being used as 'human shield' as 'strong happy' kid,https://news.yahoo.com/family-remember-3-old-died-011741085.html
4/24/2022,"Donald Trump has been holding rallies rallies to prop up his preferred 2022 congressional candidates for a while now. There isn’t much that differentiates one from another. He stirs up fear about immigrants. He rants about the 2020 election, claiming falsely that it was stolen. He bashes President Biden as incompetent. He teases that he’s going to run again in 2024. He throws a few brief nods to the local Republican or Republicans he’s supporting. On Saturday night in Delaware, Ohio, it was J.D. Vance, whom he recently endorsed for Senate. “He said some really bad shit about me,” Trump said, referencing Vance’s past criticism before calling him the party’s best chance to beat the “radical Democrat nominee.” It’s a familiar routine for Trump, and on Saturday he seemed a little more bored than usual at whatever was scrolling across his teleprompter. His coif fluttering in a light breeze for the duration of his time onstage, the former president went on multiple extended, incredibly bizarre rants about topics that don’t really have much to do with anything.

Vance Promises Voters That He Really Means It -- This Time After Losing Trump's Endorsement, Ohio Republican Calls in Mike Flynn to Dial Up the MAGA Insanity Leaked Audio: Kevin McCarthy Says Trump Admitted He Bore Some Responsibility for Capitol Attack He revived his years-long crusade against America’s water pressure, claiming people don’t have enough water to run dishwashers, that water doesn’t come out of the shower heads of new hotels, and that regarding “the third element of bathrooms” people have to flush 10 times for anything to happen. Trump says he fixed all of this, only for Biden to ruin everything.

Ronny Jackson) to ask if there was any way he could prove to America he wasn’t a moron. “I have great heritage,” Trump said, “an uncle who was a great, great genius, a father who was a genius.” Jackson suggested an aptitude test, “an X test,” but warned Trump that it could be embarrassing if he didn’t pass it. Trump says he was unfazed: “GIMME THAT TEST, DOC RONNY!” Trump: I said.., I don’t like being called stupid. Is there a test I can take to prove to these radical left maniacs that I’m much smarter than them? And he said “Sir, there is a test. It’s called an X test” pic.twitter.com/JGVklls9ci — Acyn (@Acyn) April 23, 2022 Trump at one point changed gears in the middle of making a point because he caught a glimpse of himself on a screen. “What a handsome president,” he said. He noted how he asks Melania how he looks on TV after rallies, particularly about the status of his hair, leading to one of several rants about how the TV cameras never show the size of his crowds. He also claimed the cameras turn off whenever he starts talking about the 2020 election. “Even now as I speak, two of the lights just went off,” he lied at one point. “This is communism. This is the beginning of communism.” Trump: Two lights just went off. This is communism pic.twitter.com/xfYdb5WLva — Acyn (@Acyn) April 23, 2022 The crowd laughed and cheered and applauded at all of Trump’s nonsense on Saturday night, which is part of why he’s so dangerous. Trump is talking about aptitude tests and crowd sizes, but he’s also talking about the forceful takeover of the nation’s voting systems. He talked about how state-level Republicans like Kari Lake in Arizona are trying to overturn the legitimate 2020 election results and working to do away with electronic voting in future elections. He said Mark Zuckerberg shouldn’t have been allowed to donate millions to strengthening election systems in areas where there aren’t enough resources to maintain them. He touted a new documentary that falsely claims the 2020 election was stolen. He called for the end of all early voting, mail-in voting, and drop box voting. Trump wants people to vote for J.D. Vance and the scores of other local and national candidates he has endorsed not because he thinks they’ll go to bat for the people of Ohio or whichever state they’re vying to represent, but because he knows they’ll go along with his push to cripple the democratic process and allow Republicans to overturn the results of elections they lose, which he and his administration, and sitting members of Congress, tried do to after his loss to President Biden in 2020. They’re now in the midst of a very real effort to rig the system so they won’t fail next time. Meanwhile, everyone is laughing about Trump saying he needs to flush the toilet a bunch of times.
