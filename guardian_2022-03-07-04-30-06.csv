3/7/2022,"Ollie Robinson spent England’s penultimate training session in Antigua for the first Test walking round the boundary’s edge trying to loosen up his lower back muscles and thus the team’s so-called “red-ball reset” must now start without him. No Jimmy Anderson and no Stuart Broad for the three-match series against West Indies that starts on Tuesday – the first to see the renamed Richards-Botham Trophy contested – has placed an onus on their previous support cast, with Robinson’s burgeoning Test credentials among those deemed worthy of such investment. He has 39 wickets from nine Tests at 21 runs apiece. However, the back spasms that wrecked the 28-year-old’s final appearance in Hobart during the 4-0 Ashes defeat returned last week when England played their solitary warm-up fixture, a frustration given previous concerns about his physical conditioning, meaning new-ball duties are set to be shared by Chris Woakes and Craig Overton. Woakes, speaking after England had a net at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium on Sunday, said: “Ollie is a talented bowler and he’s shown in his short Test career so far that he’s certainly got the skills and the ability to do good things in the format. He’s had a great start to his Test career so, naturally, he’ll be a big miss if he doesn’t make it on Tuesday. At the same time, it gives people opportunities.” Overton is among them and at least ensures a similar partnership to plan A can be forged, with the Somerset man offering height and bounce like Robinson while Woakes looks to get movement sideways. Cross-winds at the ground should assist the latter, even if the Dukes ball used in the Caribbean does not buff up like those in England. Woakes admitted to some good fortune at his own retention after six wickets at an average of 55 in Australia only underlined statistics that show his best work comes at home. The 33-year-old now leads an attack in which only Mark Wood (one Test match) has past experience of bowling on Caribbean surfaces. It is inevitable that the absence of Anderson and Broad will loom large over those to have been backed. Woakes was typically courteous about this task – “They are going to leave a hole. It’s certainly not easy, I can assure you that” – but also stressed that their record-breaking alliance took time to fully gel at the start. As for the so-called “reset”, Woakes believes this is more about the “mindset” of the collective rather than the recent personnel and management changes that saw eight players from Australia dropped and Chris Silverwood, Graham Thorpe and Ashley Giles all lose their jobs. “I was flat after Australia. You never like seeing people lose jobs or spots in a team,” he said. “We spend a lot of time together and you become a family. As a player, you feel guilty because you’re the one that can kind of affect the results out in the middle. “In Australia, we maybe got into a place where people were thinking more internally, thinking on personal levels rather than thinking fully about the bigger picture and about how to win games of cricket as a team. The last week or so we’ve tried to focus on how we can get better at doing things as a unit rather than individually. Naturally it’s a game that produces individual performances but we still need to be better as a collective, we can’t just rely on certain individuals to always step up and put their hand up. We need to do it as a group.” With Alex Lees set to make his debut at opener – “My main advice is to be himself,” said Woakes – Dan Lawrence inked in at No 4 after scores of 83 and 49 last week and Ben Foakes back behind the stumps, the final call for Joe Root after naming a 12-man match squad is between the spin of Jack Leach or the fast-medium of Saqib Mahmood. A pitch that produced two dull draws against Sri Lanka last year promises to offer a touch more assistance, with a hint of grass on a length two days out. But with Ben Stokes upping his workloads with the ball after a side strain, Leach is the likelier of the two and says he now feels fully backed by Root after recent talks. England’s reset continues off the field this week also, with Andrew Strauss, interim director of cricket, understood to be about to advertise for his full-time successor. Once appointed this individual will begin the hunt for a head coach, with Paul Collingwood currently leading the backroom staff on a temporary basis.",Sport/Sport,England without Ollie Robinson for first Test as ‘red-ball reset’ begins,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/06/ollie-robinson-injury-a-setback-for-england-as-red-ball-reset-begins
3/7/2022,"The Ukrainian town of Volnovakha was almost completely destroyed in the first days of the war, with intense shelling targeting civilian homes. About 90% of buildings have been damaged or reduced to rubble, and the dead lie unburied in the street, residents say. Hundreds if not thousands of people are still sheltering in basements without heat or electricity, and dwindling supplies of food and water. Russia has not made good on offers of a ceasefire and humanitarian corridor to allow evacuations. Marina, 38, an economist and mother of three, tells the story of her family’s hellish week under fire – and their terrifying escape. “My life is split into before and after these events happening in my country. I couldn’t hold back my tears about all the destruction. “When we heard the news that the Russian federation was planning to ‘liberate’ some territories, we didn’t believe it, we didn’t even think it was possible in the modern world. That’s why we decided to stay in the place we live. “If we had imagined for even a second what was coming, we would have risked trying to escape the very first moment the shelling started. Our children, who are five, six and 13, have got psychological trauma from this that will last all their lives. “On the 24th of February, we woke up to the sound of shelling, Everyone was scared. We have two children at school, and one in kindergarten. “We didn’t know what to do at that moment, but we decided to prepare our basement, and make some stockpiles of food and water. My brother came over with his family so there were 12 of us altogether. “The very first day, we tried to go back to the house from the basement when it was safe, but after hearing blasts and explosions all around we soon abandoned this idea. “After the first day, only the grown men left the basement. We waited for them and they went to cook some food, warm some water, but then the gas and electricity were cut off, so there was no light and no tea. When we had electricity it was OK; we had a heater, and it was damp but at least warm. “I believe it was the second day that the power went out, but I have confused memories about the time, because it was days of total hell living in basements. “When they cut the electricity, it was freezing and particularly hard for the children. Shells started to fall on the street near us; all the fences and walls of the house which look on to the street were hit by shrapnel. “After that attack we made the decision to move from there to our parents’ house, which is in another part of town we thought would be more safe. We took only our documents, put the children in the car, and drove straight there. “But in the end we didn’t even spend a single night there. A shell had hit the garage of a neighbour’s house. It absolutely smashed it. We decided it would be too dangerous to stay, because if a shell hit the house directly we would be buried under the debris. “There was a municipal building nearby that had a kind of half-basement with some windows. It was too hard psychologically for us being in the dark in the basement all day and night, so we went there, even though it was dirty, damp and smelt bad. “There were 37 people stuck there. We brought pillows, blankets and camp beds for the kids, but we adults just slept sitting up. “There was a little gas at first but very few supplies – just what we had on us – and it was impossible even to go to the nearby houses to collect supplies or cook them, because the shelling was so intense. We couldn’t even calculate a window of opportunity to leave, although we had a car. “For water, we just had a little that had not been cleaned or filtered from a nearby well; the men would run there. We used a toilet for a bucket. “There was also a kid with us there who has Asperger’s. He was screaming all night. No one could explain the situation to him and his mother couldn’t calm him down. “Eventually some soldiers found us. They shared the food they had and told us they would pass on the information that there are civilians stuck here needing evacuation. After that, they helped us a few more times, coming by to share food. “The biggest problem was that we had no communications. So when the soldiers finally came after three or four days and told us you have five minutes to evacuate, some people started to panic, and said Putin will kill us. “Despite that, all 37 people ran out, and they put us in an armoured car, because the tyres on normal cars would all burst. That’s how we got away from that hell. “They dropped us at a village near Volnovakha and left us in the school. We spent the night on the floor, but we were happy because we couldn’t hear any shells and gunfire. “But now we have nowhere to go, and nowhere to go back to. We don’t know what to do next. We are desperate; we didn’t expect the scale of destruction that we saw when we came out of the basement. “Even when we were sitting there and hearing the shelling, we didn’t expect that. The houses are all destroyed. I’ve seen the footage on the internet. “We don’t have a lot of money to support ourselves or to travel. We need to find a new place where we can start again. We have nothing but a few papers and what is on our phone. Even our family photos that we stored on our computer don’t exist any more.”",News/World news,‘Nowhere to go and nowhere to go back to’: Life under fire in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/nowhere-to-go-back-to-ukraine-volnovakha
3/7/2022,"Staff at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are being told what to do by the Russian military commander who seized the site last week, in violation of international safety protocols. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) expressed “grave concern” at the situation at the six-reactor plant, the largest in Europe. The agency was told by the Ukrainian nuclear regulator that “any action of plant management – including measures related to the technical operation of the six reactor units – requires prior approval by the Russian commander”. The IAEA director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said on Sunday that the Russian military command over the nuclear plant “contravenes one of the seven indispensable pillars of nuclear safety and security” which states that the operating staff must be able to carry out their safety and security duties and be able to make decisions “free of undue pressure”. Russian forces shelled the Zaporizhzhia plant in the early hours of Friday morning, damaging a walkway between two of the six reactors, and starting a fire in a nearby building used for training. As a result some of the reactors were shut down and others were put on low power. The reactors themselves are well protected by a thick concrete shell, but there is concern that more vulnerable spent fuel rods could be hit, or that the power and cooling systems could be affected, potentially triggering a meltdown. The IAEA also expressed concern that the Russian occupying force had reportedly shut down mobile phone networks and the internet connection “so that reliable information from the site cannot be obtained through the normal channels of communication”. It said communications between the plant and the Ukrainian nuclear regulator have been affected, which the IAEA said contravenes another of the nuclear safety pillars listed by Grossi, requiring “reliable communications with the regulator and others”. “In order to be able to operate the plant safely and securely, management and staff must be allowed to carry out their vital duties in stable conditions without undue external interference or pressure,” Grossi said. “The deteriorating situation regarding vital communications between the regulator and the Zaporizhzhia [nuclear plant] is also a source of deep concern, especially during an armed conflict that may jeopardize the country’s nuclear facilities at any time,” he added. “Reliable communications between the regulator and the operator are a critical part of overall nuclear safety and security.” The IAEA said that the operators at the plant were now being able to rotate between three shifts, relieving the operators who had been on duty at the time the plant was seized, but there were still “problems with availability and supply of food” which the Ukrainian regulator said was affecting morale on the plant. The IAEA also expressed alarm that communication had been lost with institutions and enterprises in the besieged port city of Mariupol where it said there are “category 1-3 radiation sources, a probable reference to medical or industrial isotopes. A category 1 source can be lethal after more than a few minutes exposure. “Such radioactive material can cause serious harm to people if not secured and managed properly,” the agency said in a statement.",News/World news,‘Grave concern’ as Ukraine Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant under Russian orders,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-staff-under-russian-orders
3/7/2022,"The men and women stumbled through the snow, heads bowed against the wind. Shivering in flimsy layers, they carried their possessions in sacks. The snow was fake, and Kim Kardashian was watching from the front row. The flimsy layers will cost thousands, and the models wore spike-heeled thigh-high boots. But in a week when more than 1 million Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes, the allusion at this Balenciaga catwalk show was clear. It was an uncomfortable watch, and veered perilously close to using a humanitarian crisis as an aesthetic. Yet it was also, for many in the audience, a humane and powerful show of empathy, an emotion not often seen on the catwalk. And for Balenciaga’s creative director, Demna, it was personal. “The war in Ukraine has triggered the pain of a past trauma I have carried in me since 1993, when the same thing happened in my home country,” wrote the designer, who as a 12-year-old was one of 250,000 Georgians forced from their homes by Abkhazian separatists during his country’s civil war, crossing the Caucasus mountains with his family. A note left on each of the 525 seats, along with a T-shirt in the colours of the Ukrainian flag, said that while “fashion week feels like some kind of an absurdity”, to cancel the show would have meant “surrendering to the evil that has already hurt me so much for almost 30 years”. “It was me,” the designer said backstage of the show when it finished. “I was seeing myself, thirty years ago, as a child in a shelter, not knowing if the roof would fall on my head.” Navigating the dissonance between fashion week and war is such treacherous territory that most designers simply steer well clear, but Demna was emboldened by his personal history. While the models walked, the designer, who lived as a refugee in Ukraine and Moscow before settling in Dusseldorf, recited a poem in Ukrainian which, he said, translated along the lines of “your sons will save you”. “It was an art installation. It had something beautiful to say,” said the actor Salma Hayek, wearing the blue and yellow T-shirt over her Balenciaga outfit as she waited to congratulate the designer. Demna insisted that the medium of fashion was irrelevant to the message of the show. “Fashion doesn’t matter now. The message must be love and peace, and fashion has to assume a strong position in this crisis.” Still, the context, as part of a showcase for a luxury goods house – one whose ultimate boss is Hayek’s husband Francois-Henri Pinault, CEO of Kering – is bound to strike an off-key note for many observers. Balenciaga has paused trading in Russia for now, and is supporting the World Food Programme operation to help people fleeing the war. When the show was planned six months ago, the snow scene was intended as a comment on the climate emergency. “It was about what snow might mean in the future. And by the future, I mean now – when there are ski resorts that don’t have snow any more,” said Demna, who no longer uses his surname, Gvasalia. “But then it took on a whole different meaning, because of the crisis we are in.” After a slow start, the fashion industry has joined in with sanctions against Russia. Louis Vuitton, Dior, Hermes, Chanel, Prada, Gucci, Saint Laurent, Cartier and Burberry have closed their Russian stores and paused online trading, as have high street brands Zara, which operates 502 Russian stores, and H&M. LVMH, which has 124 stores in Russia across brands including Vuitton and Dior, confirmed they would continue to pay their 3,500 employees there, as did Chanel, which has 17 standalone stores across Russia as well as mini-boutiques within department stores, employing 371 people.",Lifestyle/Fashion,‘Fashion doesn’t matter now’: Balenciaga show pays tribute to Ukraine’s refugees,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/06/fashion-doesnt-matter-now-balenciaga-show-pays-tribute-to-ukraines-refugees
3/7/2022,"With a few minutes to go and the victory secure, thousands of Manchester City fans momentarily turned their backs on this derby to jig up and down in a joyous Poznan. It was an occasion when they had once again laid bare the chasm that has opened up between themselves and United and they were going to enjoy it. United were better than they had been in that hideous loss to their neighbours at Old Trafford last November – the one that was pretty much the final straw for Ole Gunnar Solskjær. They had a few flickers in the first half and scored a nice goal to equalise at 1-1 through Jadon Sancho. But City are simply on another level. In what was Ralf Rangnick’s first Premier League game against opposition from the so-called big six, City led 2-1 at the break – both goals coming from the superlative Kevin De Bruyne – and the hard truth was that it could have been more. With Harry Maguire suffering more than anybody in a United defence that was loose and open for most of the game, City did make it worse in the second half. Riyad Mahrez fired home a wonderful half-volley from a De Bruyne corner for 3-1 – the ball flicking in off the hapless Maguire – and, with the City fans in carnival mood, there would be a late bonus. The substitute Ilkay Gündogan played in Mahrez, who looked offside but nevertheless blasted past David De Gea. When the VAR lines came out, it turned out that Mahrez was level. City had needed to respond to Liverpool’s home win over West Ham from Saturday and how they did. United, meanwhile, slip to fifth below Arsenal. There were five minutes on the stadium clock when City went ahead with their first forward thrust and it was a dreadfully soft way for United to cede the initiative. Bernardo Silva swapped passes with Jack Grealish, who had started ahead of Raheem Sterling, and the danger on the left was not pronounced. But Silva was allowed to pull back a low ball towards the penalty spot and De Bruyne, who had timed his arrival under an apparent cloak of darkness, slotted past De Gea. There was no pressure and no awareness from United. Rangnick was without Cristiano Ronaldo – the manager said it was because of a hip flexor problem – while Luke Shaw and Raphaël Varane were Covid positive. His response was to start Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes as false 9s and ask the wingers, Anthony Elanga and Sancho, to push up. Rangnick wanted United to engage City high up the pitch but their equaliser was the classic counterattack. It was sparked when Aaron Wan-Bissaka got the better of Grealish and his lofted ball forward was cushioned inside by Elanga for Fernandes, who found Pogba and he released Sancho. The former City winger stepped inside and curled a lovely shot into the far corner. United were in the game in the first half, in that they looked as though they could make something happen in the final third. And yet City were much more threatening, winning the ball in dangerous areas time and again to spark quick transitions. De Bruyne was a menace, revelling in the spaces between the lines, and so was Phil Foden at the tip of the formation. City’s second goal came after they forced a high turnover and Foden lifted the ball over Victor Lindelöf, who had gone for the header and missed it. Foden’s shot was saved by De Gea and, when Silva’s rebound effort broke off two United players, De Bruyne lashed home from close range. City could look back upon a fistful of chances before the interval, arguably the best being for Mahrez just before it. He jinked inside from the right and drew an excellent save out of De Gea. De Bruyne had one shot blocked by Maguire and another saved by De Gea while Foden had three moments. He was denied by Maguire following a bit of wrestling – Foden cried in vain for a penalty – while he looped a header off the top of the bar and also dragged wide after a De Bruyne break. For United, Fred almost tricked through on nine minutes while Sancho blazed high just before De Gea’s stop from Mahrez after a slick move that ended in Fernandes teeing him up. It was fast and furious, with City stepping up in the second half, applying even more pressure, forcing United further onto their heels. Elanga almost stole in on the hour only for João Cancelo to track back and clear over his own bar; Pep Guardiola had thrown himself to the ground in frustration when Foden was robbed by Scott McTominay in the buildup. But the moment that summed things up came when Maguire was booked for a lunge at the breaking De Bruyne. It shone a harsh light on the difference between the captains – one all fleet of foot; the other seemingly playing in a different time zone. Guardiola was all smiles on 68 minutes when Mahrez scored his 20th goal of the season in all competitions and there was a crushing inevitability about how the shot deflected off Maguire. Mahrez’s technique from the edge of the area was beautiful and City poured on the pain thereafter. Mahrez shot too close to De Gea, Cancelo went close with a scissors kick and both Mahrez and Gündogan could not finish in the same move. Mahrez would have the final word.",Sport/Football,Kevin De Bruyne double inspires Manchester City’s derby rout of United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/06/manchester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report
3/7/2022,"Lee Radford will insist that the fact his first victory as the Castleford coach has come against the side who unceremoniously sacked him live on television two years ago means very little, but there is no doubting he will have raised a smile at full time here. His Tigers side had laboured their way through the opening three games of the season with no success so a win of any kind, against any side, would have sufficed here. However, there is no doubting this will have meant more to Radford given it was against Hull FC. A Greg Eden hat-trick in the winger’s first appearance of the season leaves Wakefield and Toulouse as Super League’s only sides still without a win in 2022. The hosts led from as early as the opening seconds when Hull fumbled the kick-off and allowed Daniel Smith to score. Timed at just under 10 seconds, it was almost the fastest try in Super League history, and it set the tone for a frustrating afternoon for the visitors. They staged a late rally in the second half but to their credit Castleford held firm and closed the game out. “I’d have preferred to do it in round one, but the manner of that result was important,” Radford said. Smith’s try and two goals from Gareth O’Brien put Castleford into an early 8-0 lead and while Danny Houghton and Josh Griffin replied for Hull, further Tigers tries courtesy of Eden and Cheyse Blair gave the hosts a six-point lead at the break. “We turned up thinking we’d carry on what we did last week,” Hull’s coach, Brett Hodgson, lamented. That lead was extended shortly after half-time when O’Brien cut through on the angle, before quick handling sent Eden across for his second. Hull hit back through Adam Swift but the back-and-forth nature of the game continued when Eden scored his third in scintillating fashion, racing away down the left before withstanding the attention of Jake Connor to touch down in the corner. There was still time for Connor to lay on tries for Connor Wynne and Jamie Shaul to reduce the deficit to just one score. However, any hope the 2,500 Hull fans may have had was extinguished when O’Brien’s drop goal pushed the lead back out to two scores and ensured that at the fourth attempt, Radford could finally celebrate a win.",Sport/Sport,Greg Eden hat-trick give Castleford first win of season against Hull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/06/castleford-hull-super-league-rugby-league-match-report
3/7/2022,"Between March 2020 and September 2021, airlines flew 15,000 near-empty or empty planes – “ghost flights” – from UK airports to keep hold of their landing and takeoff slots. This absurd and shameful behaviour in the face of a climate emergency cannot continue. Tim Johnson from the Aviation Environment Federation points out that a Boeing 737-800 – the dominant aircraft on short-haul routes – emits about 18 tonnes of carbon dioxide on a 1,500km flight. Using that measure, these ghost flights put 270,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. The industry might argue that this represents less than 1% of total UK aviation emissions in 2019, but the practice is completely wrong in a world with net zero commitments. In normal times, airlines could keep their slots from the previous season as long as they used them 80% of the time. This was reduced to zero when Covid struck – as demand for air travel suddenly disappeared and international borders closed – but has gradually increased. Slots run on a “use it or lose it” basis. Because demand is still well below supply of flights, empty planes are being flown to keep slots. Greenpeace says that more than 100,000 ghost flights will have been seen over European skies this winter. The climate damage, says the green pressure group, is equivalent to the yearly emissions of more than 1.4m cars. Airlines’ ghost flights are needed to keep hold of slots because carriers care about financial, rather than the Earth’s, assets. IAG, the parent company of British Airways, valued its slots at three major hubs of London, Madrid and Dublin at €1.6bn (£1.3bn) in 2018. The Scandinavian carrier SAS sold two slot pairs at Heathrow a year earlier to American Airlines for $75m (£55m). And in 2015, Virgin Atlantic borrowed £220m against its slots at Heathrow. This is a symptom of a much bigger problem: in highly financialised societies, the worth of companies listed on stock markets relies on assets, earnings and profits. The way slots are allocated will not change unless politicians grasp that increasing wellbeing is more important than the growth in the value of transactions. Ghost flights contribute to GDP growth in a similar way that an oil spill does. Both devastate the environment, but can generate business. This is why ideas such as selling more spare slots to aid new entrants are not the answer. That’s just another corporate deal. The orthodox view is that economies should expand by 2% a year to increase national welfare. Yet this means doubling the size of the economy every 35 years. This does not take into account the fact that economic activity begins with the extraction of natural resources; that it does not necessarily increase human enjoyment; that it imposes environmental and social costs; and that it can be damaging in terms of inequality. Treating GDP growth as an end in itself risks, as the UN suggests, growth that does more harm than good. Running empty flights to ensure that the runways are busy at the appointed time represents a very high cost to the natural world. There is a need to replace the economic and financial systems that fail to account for the benefits that humanity derives from nature, and to provide incentives to manage nature wisely and maintain its value. Last year, a study for the University of Leeds found that for the last three decades, no country has met the basic needs of its residents without overconsuming natural resources. If current trends continue, no country will do so over the next 30 years either, perpetuating human deprivation and worsening ecological breakdown. Ghost flights reveal that what needs fixing is more than the broken system for allocating airport slots.",Opinion/Opinion,"The Guardian view on ghost flights: a symptom, not the disease | Editorial",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/06/the-guardian-view-on-ghost-flights-a-symptom-not-the-disease
