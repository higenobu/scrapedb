2/20/2022,"Pep Guardiola insisted Manchester City did not need to lose to understand how hard defending the title will be after a 3-2 defeat to Tottenham left Liverpool firmly back into the race. The reverse at home means the champions remain on 63 points, six ahead of the Merseyside club, having played one more match – 26 – than Jürgen Klopp’s team, who are City’s visitors on 9 April.  Guardiola said: “We didn’t need to lose a game already to know how hard it is [to win the league]. There are many, many games still to play. I said a few weeks ago that we needed a lot of points and that it was going to be so difficult because the teams we are playing are fighting for the Champions League or the Europa League or not to be relegated. “There are still a lot of games to go and a lot of points to play for and we know how difficult it is. We know what we need to do to be there [at the end]. Now we must recover. It will be good to understand how difficult it is [to win the title]. We are now going to train and prepare for the next games. “Every goal they scored was different, but the third goal we defended badly at the back post and we lost the game.” Tottenham’s most impressive player was Harry Kane, who created their opener and scored twice, claiming the three points with a 95th-minute winner. Guardiola was asked if the centre-forward’s display showed why he wished to buy the 28-year-old in the summer window. “He didn’t have to score those goals today to show his quality,” Guardiola said. “All of the UK knows how good he is.” Spurs’ victory ended a run of three consecutive losses in the competition and lifts them to seventh place on 39 points, four behind Manchester United in fourth, with two matches in hand. Their manager, Antonio Conte, said: “This win will give us more confidence. It wasn’t simple to play Manchester City after three losses in a row. But this is a process, we are working very hard to improve every aspect. This type of game gives us confidence. “First of all I hate to lose. Our reaction was important. The Premier League is very difficult. Every game you have to fight a lot. We are continuing to improve everything and every level we work very hard on. Only one win is not good enough. Don’t forget we are coming off three losses. But a win against Manchester City is very good. We have a lot of space for improvement. This is one of the hardest working teams I have managed in my career.” Kane said: “For me it was [about ending] three losses in a row and we had to find a way of getting our season back on track. To get the result we did was really, really special. The boys worked their socks off today. To get the goals was obviously nice.”",Sport/Football,"We didn’t need to lose to know how tough title defence is, says Guardiola",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/19/we-didnt-need-to-lose-to-know-how-tough-it-is-says-pep-guardiola
2/20/2022,"Secret discussions are under way between western allies over how to arm what they expect to be fierce Ukrainian resistance in the event of a Russian invasion that topples the Kyiv government. Boris Johnson laid bare the case for such a move in a dramatic speech to the Munich security conference where he stated it was in the collective self-interests of the west for any Russian invasion to “fail and be seen to fail”.  He said that any invasion would lead to “a generation of bloodshed and misery” as Ukrainians would fight a fierce campaign to resist Russian forces. The message was underscored in a meeting between Johnson and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on the margins of the Munich conference where the two men predicted a fierce resistance to an invasion. Similar discussions have been taking place in the US, where reports suggest the country’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, has told senators that the US is willing to arm a resistance and is not going to accept a Russian military victory that erases the principles of national self-determination. At the crucial gathering in Munich, Johnson warned of a protracted battle after any invasion that Russia could not contain. He said: “A lightning war would be followed by a long and hideous period of reprisals and revenge and insurgency, and Russian parents would mourn the loss of young Russian soldiers, who in their way are every bit as innocent as the Ukrainians now bracing themselves for attack. “If Ukraine is overrun by brute force, I fail to see how a country encompassing nearly a quarter of a million square miles – the biggest nation in Europe apart from Russia itself – could then be held down and subjugated for ever.” It came as Zelenskiy demanded greater support from the west in the face of Russian aggression and the immediate imposition of tough sanctions on Russia, which leaders have vowed to impose should an invasion take place. Ukraine’s military said two of its soldiers had been killed and four injured in enemy shelling on Saturday. It said there were 70 ceasefire violations as of 5pm local time. Civilians living close to the frontline with separatist-controlled territory experienced another day of intense shelling and bombardment. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said “armed Russian formations” had unleashed “provocative firing” all across the 155-mile (250km) frontline in the east of the country. Meanwhile, there was growing suspicion that Russia was behind a series of seemingly coordinated “false flag” attacks, designed to give Vladimir Putin a pretext for a possible invasion. They included a car bomb on Friday evening outside the administration building in separatist-run Donetsk, an “attack” on a water station and a shell that landed just over the border in Russia’s Rostov region. In Stanytsia Luhanska, a Ukrainian-controlled town on the outskirts of Luhansk, one of the Russia-backed separatist capitals, repeated thuds of incoming fire were audible on Saturday afternoon. Ukrainian officials in the town said there had been frequent bursts of incoming fire over the past few days. The Ukrainian military took a group of journalists into Stanytsia Luhanska by helicopter and armoured vehicles on Saturday to help dispel what it said was a false Russian narrative that the Ukrainian army has been behind the recent rise in violence. Ukraine’s military intelligence service said on Saturday the Kremlin was planning further destabilising operations, which could even see civilians killed, with an attack blamed on Kyiv. The Ukrainian capital was also a possible target, it indicated. The service said that leaflets circulating in the Donetsk and Luhansk rebel republics, purporting to come from the Ukrainian army, were fakes. The flyers claimed Ukraine was preparing to attack. Ukraine’s pro-western government said it was committed to dialogue and had no intention of launching an attack, or carrying out acts of sabotage in the Donbas region. Meanwhile, Nato said it was moving its personnel from Kyiv to the western city of Lviv. The British embassy relocated to Lviv on Saturday. Until now, public discussion has been limited to the massive economic sanctions the west will impose on the Russian economy – and Putin’s circle. Steps have also been taken to protect Nato’s eastern flank, principally in Poland, Romania and the Baltics. Joe Biden has ruled out American troops being sent to Ukraine since the US has no legal obligation to help Ukraine that extends to providing military assistance. However, in his speech to the Munich security conference, Johnson made it clear that the west must stand by Ukraine by ensuring Russia was ultimately repelled. “If dialogue fails and if Russia chooses to use violence against an innocent and peaceful population in Ukraine, and to disregard the norms of civilised behaviour between states, and to disregard the charter of the United Nations, then we at this conference should be in no doubt that it is in our collective interest that Russia should ultimately fail and be seen to fail,” he said. He presaged the possibility of further military help when he added: “We have to steel ourselves for the possibility of a protracted crisis, with Russia maintaining the pressure and searching for weaknesses over an extended period, and we must together refuse to be worn down.” The degree of military assistance and the extent to which it is overt is still under discussion. Its scope in part depends on events on the ground. In public, Johnson has so far only said it is possible arms would be supplied, adding he would not rule it out. The west would not wish to be seen to be fomenting a futile and bloody resistance that was risking a wider conflict between Nato and Russia. In the US, the Biden administration has approved about $650m (£480m) of military equipment to Kyiv in the past year, and more recently, it authorised a $200m package to Ukraine that included Javelin anti-tank missiles, other anti-armour systems, grenade launchers and munitions. The US has also allowed the Baltic states to send weapons, including anti-aircraft missiles. Last night, Johnson said that Russia’s plans were “in motion”, but that Putin could still pull back and call off his military operations. “In the course of the next few days if there is a violent kinetic phase of this in Ukraine, that is the moment when the west, when Nato, will be truly tested,” he said. “If there’s still a path for diplomacy, for negotiation, then let’s go down it.”",News/World news,West plans to arm resistance if Russian forces occupy Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/19/west-plans-to-arm-resistance-if-russian-forces-occupy-ukraine
2/20/2022,"London’s transport authority could declare bankruptcy in a matter of days if the government fails to provide continued financial support. Transport for London (TfL) saw its income severely reduced during the Covid-19 pandemic because of the sudden lack of passengers travelling on the network.  The government bolstered the public body, which relies on fare revenue to fund its operations, with a series of short-term funding deals. However, the latest ran out at midnight on Friday, and an extension is yet to be agreed. It is understood that the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, remained locked in negotiations through most of Saturday to secure a new deal. “It’s vital that the government provides TfL with the long-term funding deal it needs to properly maintain vital transport services in the capital,” a spokesperson for the mayor said. “Some 43,000 jobs outside London depend on TfL’s investment. If the government refuses to deliver the funding TfL needs, it could impact TfL’s UK-wide supply chain, hitting jobs and growth and holding back the economic recovery in London and across the UK.” The spokesperson added that without a clear indication of government support “in a matter of days”, TfL with not be able to fulfil its legal requirement to offer certainty as to whether it can balance its budget. One of the options network bosses will have to consider includes issuing a report under section 114 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988, which would in effect declare TfL bankrupt. On Saturday, a TfL spokesperson said: “There is no UK recovery from the pandemic without a London recovery and there is no London recovery without a properly funded transport network in the capital. We hope these discussions can be concluded successfully soon.” A TfL statement released earlier this month suggested that the network could enter a period of “managed decline” over the coming years if the government continued to refuse to offer long-term funding. However, the government said it was the mayor’s job to reduce costs across the network to provide financial stability. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: “We have repeatedly shown our commitment to supporting London’s transport network throughout the pandemic, providing over £4.5bn in emergency funding to Transport for London and pledging a further billion pounds of capital investment every year up until at least 2024/25 – all at a time of significant pressure on the national finances. “We’re aware that TfL are still feeling the aftereffects of the pandemic, but it is the mayor’s responsibility to accelerate overdue reforms that will ensure TfL becomes financially sustainable in a way that is fair to taxpayers.” The number of people using TfL services remains far below pre-pandemic levels. New figures show Tube passenger levels are at 59%, while bus usage is about 75%.",News/Politics,"Transport for London may go bankrupt without extra funds, claims mayor",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/19/transport-for-london-may-go-bankrupt-without-extra-funds-claims-mayor
