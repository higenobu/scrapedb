1/29/2022,"As in the three previous women’s Test matches going back to 2019, rain intervened to derail an emerging contest and to stifle the chances of a result. The second and third sessions of the third day at Manuka Oval were washed away, reprieving Australia from the precarity of two early wickets for 12 runs in the third innings. That was an overall lead of 52, after England captain Heather Knight turned her overnight 127 into an unbeaten masterpiece of 168 to close the first-innings deficit to 40 runs, with her team all out for 297. Resuming at 235 for eight to start the day, Knight’s innings continued to get help from Sophie Ecclestone, and Ecclestone kept getting help from luck. Her first ball of the day was dropped at second slip from Ellyse Perry, and another nick from Tahlia McGrath 10 overs later followed suit. Australian captain Meg Lanning was the one who couldn’t hold on. Ecclestone didn’t score many herself but stayed in while Knight did, their partnership reaching an even 100 runs before McGrath got the No 10 batter leg before wicket. It was England’s highest ninth-wicket stand, and the third best in all women’s Tests.  Having moved within 68 of Australia’s score, Knight would have known that getting bowled out would have its advantages. With time in the match ticking down, conceding a lead might make Australia more likely to have time to set a target that England could chase. Alternatively, using good bowling conditions on a dark overcast morning with a new ball might let England rack up wickets and control the fourth-innings target themselves. So Knight and last batter Kate Cross swung hard before Cross on 11 pulled Perry to fine leg, caught after a sensational run and dive by Darcie Brown for the second time in the innings. Cross ran from the field to let Knight enjoy a leisurely walk off alone, raising her bat for those 168 runs, in an innings where Ecclestone made 34 and the next best was 15. Then it was time for the Katherine Brunt show again, as five wickets in the first innings became seven in the match. Brunt had taken Alyssa Healy’s edge for a duck on day one thanks to a loose drive, but completed a pair for Healy third ball of the innings with an impeccable delivery, angling in before swinging away, leaping off a length, and grabbing the crisp edge of a defensive shot. Fifth over of the day, Brunt got one to seam into the left-handed Rachael Haynes, taking the inside edge onto her thigh pad for Tammy Beaumont at short leg to take a smart left-handed catch. Ellyse Perry came to join the injured Beth Mooney with four minutes to go before lunch, the light disappearing, Brunt with two wickets for four runs, and England every chance to further apply the squeeze. But the first few drops of rain spared Perry from facing a ball, lunch was taken early, and the players never got back on. They will do what they can to create a match if the fourth day’s weather allows, but from here it’s most likely that the only useful pressure to apply will be on administrators, to make them belatedly stop this farce of denying women’s matches a fifth day once and for all.",Sport/Sport,Quick wickets put Australia on edge before rain intervenes in Women’s Ashes Test,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/29/quick-wickets-put-australia-on-edge-before-rain-intervenes-in-womens-ashes-test
1/29/2022,"The official investigation of Hunter Biden’s dealings in China and elsewhere rests in the hands of David Weiss, a Trump-appointed federal prosecutor in Delaware, and the US justice department under Joe Biden’s attorney general, Merrick Garland. Politically speaking, we now have Red-Handed by Peter Schweizer, who would very much like to help us digest the business past of the 46th president’s troublesome son.  Schweizer’s works include Clinton Cash, a compendium of opposition research that helped shape the presidential election in 2016. These days, he is president of the Government Accountability Institute, a think tank funded by the Mercer family, part of the rightwing ecosystem. Rebekah Mercer chairs the GAI board, a position previously held by Steve Bannon, whom Donald Trump pardoned of fraud charges but who is now under indictment for contempt of Congress. Mercer is also a founding investor in Parler, a rightwing alternative to Twitter and communications vehicle for Trump’s faithful in the run-up to the 6 January insurrection. The Mercers are mainstays of Breitbart News and once funded James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas – of which, more later. Via Cambridge Analytica, the Mercers helped hijack Brexit. Not surprisingly, Nigel Farage counts the Mercers as allies. If Republicans recapture the House in November, as expected, most see investigations of Hunter Biden and his father an inevitable sequel. Schweizer has published a roadmap, from sources including Secret Service travel logs, materials from former business associates and that infamous laptop. Schweizer argues that the rich and powerful have grown too cozy with China, at the expense of their own country. His central contention is that the Biden family garnered approximately $31m from individuals with direct ties to Chinese intelligence. Hunter Biden has denied wrongdoing. In 2020, Politifact said Schweizer’s claims about Joe Biden did “not add up to a picture” of his “being corrupt or pursuing policies contrary to the national interest”. Schweizer, however, fires shots across the political spectrum. John Boehner, a Republican speaker of the House, and Henry Kissinger, secretary of state to two Republican presidents, are in his sights. So are the Bushes. Chuck Schumer, Mark Warner, Chris Coons and Joe Manchin, all Democratic senators, are praised. Schweizer lambasts Silicon Valley for enabling China’s rise and turning a blind eye to human rights abuses. Elon Musk and Bill Gates are criticized, Wall Street (prominently Goldman Sachs, Blackstone and Black Rock), the National Basketball Association and academe too. Yale University receives particular attention. Not surprisingly, Schweizer does not consider links to China enjoyed by Trump and his most ardent followers. He ignores, for example, tax records that show Trump International Hotels Management paid more than $188,000 in China while pursuing licensing deals between 2013 and 2015, and maintained a bank account there. Likewise, Schweizer looks away from Ted Cruz. The Texas senator’s wife is a banker at Goldman. The Cruzes hold direct investments of between $15,000 and $50,000 in the Goldman Sachs China Equity Fund Class P, a mutual fund with positions in Alibaba and Tencent – companies firmly in Schweizer’s sights. Then again, the Mercers are Cruz donors. In 2016, Cruz’s presidential campaign was a Cambridge Analytica client. Schweizer calls for a US lobbying ban on companies linked to the Chinese military and Chinese intelligence, and their exclusion from US stock exchanges. He also demands the press pursue big tech involvement with China. As models for how to resist the Chinese, he holds out Peter Thiel and his company Palantir. Thiel, a rightwing megadonor, gained notoriety when he wrote in 2009 that women and minorities had mucked up democratic capitalism. A Palantir employee planted the concept of data harvesting with Cambridge Analytica. As for China’s territorial ambitions? In another book, Trump was quoted by the Washington Post’s Josh Rogin. If the Chinese were to invade Taiwan, he told a senator, “there isn’t a fucking thing we can do”. It seems unlikely the US could be capable of decoupling its economy from China while avoiding clashes. China’s opacity with regard to Covid does not instill confidence. Schweizer’s book does at least deliver food for thought. If Red-Handed is an amalgam of more than 1,100 footnotes, facts, arguments and innuendos, American Muckraker by James O’Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas, is a 288-page exercise in self-reverence. “The American Muckraker understands that the path to truth involves suffering and sacrifice,” O’Keefe writes. OK. Elsewhere, he compares his plight to that of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Alabama in the late 1950s, as it worked for “equality”. Really. He also repeatedly refers to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the great Russian dissident. What does O’Keefe do for a living? Mostly, he makes sting videos targeting Democrats and progressives. Targets have included Planned Parenthood and a teachers’ union. Practically speaking, American Muckraker is O’Keefe’s attempt to bolster his claim of being a journalist while re-defining what the media actually is in an era of cold civil war. On that note, he recounts a conversation with Brian Karem after the Playboy White House reporter had a dust-up with a Trump loyalist, Sebastian Gorka. “I’m on the same team as you,” said O’Keefe. “I respect you guys.” Really? Project Veritas counts the Donald J Trump Foundation among past donors and Erik Prince, former head of the Blackwater private security company and brother of Trump’s education secretary, Betsy DeVos, was involved in its sting operations against Trump adversaries. O’Keefe makes clear he is not keen on a shedding a light on those who fund his work. He does have a genuine grievance. In early November 2021, the FBI raided his apartment, handcuffed him in his underwear and seized two phones. He was not arrested. Reportedly, the feds swooped in connection with the disappearance and unauthorized publication of a diary kept by Ashley Biden, the president’s daughter. Project Veritas never wrote anything on the topic and handed the document over. The justice department had placed the first amendment and O’Keefe’s civil liberties in its crosshairs, notwithstanding a court-ordered warrant. But that is only part of the story. In 2020, O’Keefe sued the New York Times for libel in connection with its coverage of videos concerning alleged voter fraud in Minnesota. A New York judge refused to dismiss the suit and O’Keefe has obtained an injunction that bars the paper from publishing documents written by a Project Veritas lawyer. O’Keefe’s mantra might be: “Free speech for me – but not for thee.” Despite the efforts of Richard Nixon in the case of the Pentagon Papers, prior restraint remains anathema to a free press – as Donald Trump’s late brother, Robert, learned when he failed to block publication of a niece’s tell-all. Nonetheless, Trump allies are urging the supreme court to reconsider protections afforded to the media under US libel law. Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch have indicated they are willing. The fact that the decision in question was rendered by a unanimous court a half-century ago means little. American Muckraker is a book for such troubled times.

1/29/2022,"In the final days of April 2020, bankers and Treasury officials were huddled over laptops in makeshift home offices across the country, negotiating the terms of what is fast becoming the most controversial of the government’s pandemic rescue schemes. The country was in its sixth week of national lockdown after the Covid outbreak, and the Treasury’s head of banking and credit, David Raw, was leading video calls with more than 20 senior staff from across government and the City – including the big banks HSBC, NatWest, Barclays and Lloyds, Santander, Virgin Money and AIB – to try to push through the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s ambitious plan for a more accessible, 100% government-backed small business loan scheme.  After ordering the closure of all offices and non-essential shops and services, Sunak had promised financial aid. But the first scheme to launch, which offered loans of up to £5m and was known as the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS), had been criticised by business lobby groups and MPs as too costly, too slow and too risky – borrowers were required to give personal guarantees, usually in the form of their own homes. So the Treasury introduced a second scheme, bounce back loans, designed to get cheap money to firms in as little as 24 hours. 23 March2020 – The UKenters its first national lockdown. Banks complete the coronavirus interruptionloan scheme (CBILS) at 3am on launch day. The job furlough scheme alsolaunches. 2 April2020 – Chancellorbans banks from demanding personal guarantees amid concerns CBILS is notdelivering fast enough. 16 April2020 – Thegovernment extends CBILS to cover large businesses in the CLBILS. 27 April2020 – Sunakannounces the bounce back loan scheme (BBLS) for loans of £50,000 for those whocertified they qualified. 2 May2020 – BritishBusiness Bank chief executive Keith Morgan writes to business secretary AlokSharma that the scheme’s rapid launch posed “very significant fraud and creditrisks”. 4 May2020 – Thebusiness department launches the bounce back loan scheme, with 80,000applications by the first afternoon. 7 October2020 – TheNational Audit Office warns taxpayers stand to lose £26bn on BBLS and that upto 60% of customers may fail to repay loans. HSBC closes the scheme to newcustomers. 2November 2020 – Treasuryextends BBLS, CBILS and CLBILS to end of January 2021. 3 March2021 – Sunakannounces £100m for a taxpayer protection taskforce of more than 1,200 HMRCstaff to combat Covid19-related fraud. 3December 2021 – NationalAudit Office report describes government funding for counter-fraud on thebounce back loans “inadequate” and highlights £4.9bn estimated BBLS fraudlosses. 24January 2021 – Treasuryand business minister Lord Agnew resigns at the House of Lords dispatch box,citing frustrations with the lack of action on Covid-19-related fraud. It was a “frenetic, difficult period of time,” one senior banking executive said. After nearly 11 days of round-the-clock meetings, a final agreement was signed in the early hours of Monday 4 May. But the strategy agreed in those discussions for accelerating payouts was so controversial that it would, two years later, lead to the shock resignation of Lord Agnew, a joint Cabinet Office and Treasury minister whose brief included counter-fraud. He stepped down on Monday, lambasting the government for its “woeful” efforts to control fraud. In the space of 15 months, from March 2020, the three main Covid loan schemes – bounce back, CBILS and a scheme for larger loans, CLBILS – handed out nearly £80bn to businesses. Bounce back was the biggest scheme, distributing £47bn to 1.6 million recipients, who were able to borrow up to £50,000 each. Meanwhile, fraud losses were estimated at £4.9bn at the end of March – although PwC, the accountancy firm hired by the government, has since reduced its estimate to £3.5bn. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the raid on taxpayer funds by gangs of criminals should be “a source of enduring shame to the chancellor”. Banks intent on protecting their finances usually apply stringent credit checks to help avoid fraud and ensure customers can repay their loans, but what was eventually agreed for bounce back, amid pressure from the Treasury to speed up loan distribution, was that checks would be dispensed with altogether. “The British Business Bank was very, very clear with the lenders – and it’s very explicit in all the documentation – that the banks weren’t allowed, actually were prohibited, from undertaking credit checks,” one senior banking executive said. “But then the trade-off was against a real need to get that money into the economy really quickly.” There were rules: borrowers had to confirm they were affected by Covid and based in the UK, that they were in business as of 1 March 2020 and not insolvent as of 1 December 2019. But applicants were left to self-certify that they met these criteria. While lenders would have to make reasonable efforts to chase down the debts, a state guarantee put taxpayers on the hook for 100% of losses linked to defaults or fraudulent applications. “From the lenders’ point of view, they’ve done what they were asked to do,” one director from the banking industry said. The government was repeatedly warned that the approach was leaving it open to fraud. The business department, which ran the schemes, has revealed that its top civil servant sought ministerial directions to push through the three loan schemes because they did not meet the usual standards for government spending. Industry insiders said the fraud risks associated with scrapping credit checks and turning bounce back into a one-page form were fully discussed with the Treasury. Indeed, the former head of the British Business Bank – which was in charge of overseeing the scheme – wrote to the then business secretary, Alok Sharma, two days before the bounce back launch to warn that the scheme was “vulnerable to abuse by individuals and by participants in organised crime”. A month later, in June 2020, Sunak received a joint letter from three anti-corruption groups, calling for the names of recipients to be published – a request that has not yet been met and which is being challenged at a tribunal. Ultimately, speed trumped caution, opening the doors to experienced criminals. Insolvency Service records show some took loans to fund gambling or currency trading – money the government is unlikely to ever recover – while others spent it on things such as home improvements, car raffles or luxury personal items. Other cases are more astonishing, and suggest serious problems in the banks’ basic know-your-customer requirements. The National Crime Agency in December reported the case of Artem Terzyan, 38, from Russia, and Deivis Grochiatskij, 44, from Lithuania. They were jailed for 33 years for laundering £70m on behalf of criminal gangs from around the world – including £10m in bounce back loans. Police had arrested the pair back in June 2018 after following an Audi around the UK’s lorry parks and service stations picking up dirty cash. Yet when the pandemic started, while they were on bail, they both started to claim £50,000 loans in huge numbers. One unnamed UK bank leant them £3.2m. Some banks were more cautious than others. While Agnew did not name the lenders, he said 87% of bounce back loans paid to already dissolved companies came from just three lenders, while two banks were responsible for 81% of cases where loans were granted to companies incorporated after the pandemic hit. The British Business Bank did not confirm the figures and said it was too early to draw conclusions on repayment data. Some banks tried to mitigate the risks by prioritising their own customers – whom they already had run checks on – over new clients. “From a fraud detection perspective, we were more confident that our fraud checks would be stronger with an existing customer versus a new customer,” one senior banking boss said. Questions remain as to how determinedly the government will be able to chase all fraudulent claims, but some changes have been made, including taking steps to ensure that all businesses that are dissolved by their owners are systematically checked for outstanding loans. Resources are relatively meagre when it comes to investigating the loan schemes. While the business department asked the Treasury for an extra £32m for counter-fraud operations, the National Audit Office said even that sum was “inadequate”. A Treasury spokesperson said: “Fraud is totally unacceptable, and we’re taking action on multiple fronts to crack down on anyone who has sought to exploit our schemes and bring them to justice.” The government is also relying heavily on banks to try to chase smaller-scale fraudsters. While banks are required to make reasonable efforts to chase down debts before they can claim the government guarantee, anti-corruption campaigners are concerned about the lack of commercial incentive to do so; their loan losses are 100% covered, whereas chasing money adds considerable costs. Susan Hawley, the executive director of Spotlight on Corruption, said the scale of the fraud highlighted longstanding problems in the UK’s approach to white-collar crime, including repeated delays to reforms of Companies House, the UK’s corporate register. “The government is just not putting its money where its mouth is” on fighting fraud, said Hawley. “This is really chickens coming home to roost in the failure to fund it.”",News/Politics,How the UK government lost £4.9bn to Covid loan fraud,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/29/how-the-uk-government-lost-49bn-to-covid-loan
1/29/2022,"Parents of adult children who sit down to do their tax return this weekend should check if they are due a refund. One Guardian reader has just discovered HM Revenue and Customs is taxing him as if his family is still getting child benefit, even though his two children are now 22 and 19, and the family stopped receiving the cash almost 18 months ago.  His case is similar to one featured in Guardian Money a year ago, involving a woman with a daughter in her 20s who received a £4,300 tax rebate because HMRC had wrongly carried on making deductions for child benefit for several years. Earlier this week, HMRC said 4 million people had still not filed their 2020-21 self-assessment tax return and paid any tax owed ahead of what is still officially the deadline: Monday 31 January. However, it was announced recently that those who file late will not be hit with a penalty, provided their return is submitted by 28 February. Child benefit is currently paid at £21.15 a week for the eldest or only child, then £14 a week for each additional child, and is worth £1,828 a year for a family with two children. You normally qualify if you are responsible for a child under 16 – or under 20 if they stay in approved full-time education or training, which includes A-levels. Lots of families have been pulled into self-assessment because at least one parent has an income of more than £50,000. Under the government’s high-income child benefit charge, the payout is clawed back on a sliding scale. The high-income tax charge is 1% of the amount of child benefit for each £100 of income on a sliding scale between £50,000 and £60,000. For those earning more than £60,000 the charge is 100% – in effect, they receive no child benefit. The reader did his tax return a few days ago and was amazed to be told he was owed £815 for overpaid tax for 2020-21. He has two children and has been affected by the tax charge for several years. However, his younger child stopped being eligible for the benefit in September 2020, shortly after leaving sixth form. The refund related to deductions that HMRC had continued to make for child benefit, even though he became “free of the tax charge” a few months into the 2020-21 tax year. His tax code notice letters for 2021-22 mentioned child benefit, and when he visited Gov.uk to look at his personal tax account, it stated that his current code includes a deduction of £2,650 for child benefit. This suggests he will be due another refund of at least several hundred pounds for 2021-22. His case shows the importance of checking your tax code to make sure it is correct for your situation and not based on outdated or incorrect information. Many people file their tax code notice letters away without looking at them closely – or at all. HMRC previously told Guardian Money that PAYE collects the correct amount of tax for the vast majority of customers, and that it will change someone’s tax code if it is notified of a change in circumstances.",Lifestyle/Money,Parents of adults taxed by HMRC as if still getting child benefit,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/29/parents-of-adults-taxed-by-hmrc-as-if-still-getting-child-benefit

1/29/2022,"This was meant to be Boris Johnson’s week of reckoning, but after more twists and turns than a Formula One grand prix, he ended the week closeted away in his country retreat of Chequers, his premiership safe – for now. Scores of Tory MPs have been awaiting the verdict of Sue Gray, the senior civil servant investigating alleged lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street, before deciding whether to press for a vote of no confidence in the prime minister.  With her report now apparently entangled with a police investigation, Conservative backbenchers have been left to draw their own conclusions, and Johnson’s allies believe many will opt to let him fight on. “I think there’s a 55% chance that he’ll survive,” said one backer, though they called for a clearout of staff in No 10 so Johnson can start afresh. That’s not how it looked on Tuesday morning when the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, electrified Westminster during an appearance at the London assembly. Having repeatedly declined to get her force involved in this most toxic of political scandals, Dick confirmed her force would now launch an investigation into the Downing Street parties. Johnson had been forewarned, but chose not to mention it to his cabinet at their weekly Tuesday meeting. Trapped in the cabinet room without their phones, ministers were among the last people to hear the news as they emerged. There followed an unedifying and confusing 72 hours, which began with the Met suggesting it had no objections to Gray publishing her report in full, and a frenzy of speculation that the report was to be published imminently, but ended on Friday with no sign of the report, and a formal statement conceding the police had asked her to make “minimal reference” to the eight events they are investigating. And in the vacuum, Johnson and his allies have spent their time fighting back hard. He has been meeting wavering MPs to hear their political demands, and Downing Street’s planning “grid” is being filled up with trips and announcements designed to show him getting on with delivering “the people’s priorities”. At prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, Johnson was boisterous and defiant, insisting he couldn’t pre-empt the Met inquiry and highlighting his achievements in government. Tory MPs roared their approval, several times yelling “More!” at deafening volume. Johnson came up with a new attack line on the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, accusing him of being “a lawyer, not a leader”. A Westminster veteran pointed out afterwards that the Conservative party continued cheering on Margaret Thatcher in the final days of her premiership, almost right up until the moment they chucked her out of office. But some of Johnson’s ragtag band of supporters have been lobbying their colleagues by sharing a grainy Daily Express front page from 1990 lamenting Thatcher’s downfall with the headline “What have they done?” (apparently forgetting that by ditching a deeply unpopular leader, the Tories managed to win a fourth general election in 1992 under John Major.) In a line that appeared to be aimed at his own MPs, Johnson claimed Starmer “wants me out of the way” – a nod to those backbenchers fretting about their prospects for re-election. Labour MPs later hit back on Twitter, calling Johnson, “a liar, not a leader” – language they are prevented by convention from using in the House of Commons. Starmer contrasted Johnson’s statement to MPs that Covid guidance “was followed completely in No 10” – and that he had been “repeatedly assured” there were no parties – with the facts that had since emerged. He once again called on Johnson to resign. At the same time as Johnson’s honesty over partygate was being questioned, fresh evidence emerged about his alleged role in authorising the evacuation of animals from Afghanistan by the Nowzad charity. Emails published by the foreign affairs committee showed Foreign Office officials suggesting the prime minister had approved the controversial airlift, at a time when life-or-death decisions were being made about who British troops should help to leave Kabul. The prime minister has dismissed the claims as “total rhubarb”, but the committee’s chair, Tom Tugendhat – who has been burnishing his credentials as a potential leadership candidate – is unlikely to let the issue drop. As Gray continued to wrangle with lawyers and the Met about what could be published, Johnson donned hi-vis on Thursday for a visit to Wales. The resulting photos were reminiscent of carefully curated shots from the 2019 general election campaign: a bullish prime minister surrounded by smiling workers in hard hats. This will be Johnson’s approach in the coming days: look busy – preferably far away from No 10 – sound serious and switch the focus to pressing political issues, such as the war in Ukraine. The publication of Michael Gove’s levelling up white paper, now expected next week, will allow the government to point to its domestic reform agenda, largely shelved since partygate. The question for Conservative MPs will be whether Johnson should now be allowed time to try to claw back his reputation and rebuild their party’s standing in the polls, or whether he is irrevocably damaged. One MP ridiculed colleagues claiming to be awaiting Gray’s verdict. “What’s she going to say? Three words: ‘It’s a shitshow.’ Why do you need to wait for that?” they said. Johnson’s supporters hope that with every day that goes by, the shocking details of lockdown-busting parties will fade from the public’s minds – helped by the backing of the rightwing papers. Wednesday’s Daily Mail front page, after the news broke of a birthday party for Johnson in 2020, railed against “a nation that’s lost all sense of proportion”. This week’s disclosure that Johnson had a birthday celebration in Downing Street in June 2020, with up to 30 people singing around the cabinet table, didn’t change the dial for his supporters in the media. Nor did the much-mocked attempts by the Northern Ireland minister, Conor Burns, to defend what had happened. “It was not a premeditated, organised party,” said Burns. “He was, in a sense, ambushed with a cake.” But one disillusioned Conservative MP, who once supported the prime minister, suggested no shift of policy or personnel in No 10 was likely to win over the public, however much time was allowed to pass. They pointed to a widely shared, heartbreaking Sky News clip of a man called Richard Macvicar, who lost his parents and his sister to Covid, saying: “I would have loved 10 minutes to say ‘ta ra’ to my family members.” “Some people might be willing to forget,” the MP said. “But those people who have terribly suffered feel very differently.”",News/Politics,"His premiership safe for now, Johnson clings on – and fights back",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/29/his-premiership-safe-for-now-boris-johnson-clings-on-and-fights-back
1/29/2022,"It’s a series that is at least partly about Tommy Lee’s penis, so let’s talk about length. Pam & Tommy (Star on Disney+, from Wednesday) is an eight-part series that could have been a movie instead. You realise this about seven minutes in: the first episode, which almost exclusively follows Seth Rogen’s pornographer turned builder Rand Gauthier, takes its time with every single scene. We see Rand nail together a bed while Pamela Anderson and Lee have outrageously loud sex upstairs. We watch him drive home, put his feet up on the sofa, light a cigarette then stub it out. We flashback to his childhood to find out why he doesn’t like pissing his pants. We see him try to charm his boss into helping him hijack a safe from Lee’s unfinished Malibu mansion, and we see that boss umm and ahh and eventually say no. All of this takes ages. All of this could have been cut. We could have had a neat two-and-a-half hour feature film, and it would have been fine. Instead, we have eight hours of streaming to do.  Normally, I would be against this – I still have four episodes of Succession to catch up on; can people stop making unmissable legacy TV for one minute! – but Pam & Tommy is so good, so fun, that the detail makes the world richer and denser and more of a hoot than popping to the cinema. First, the casting, which I never normally comment on (‘Yeah, this professional actor is good in the role they were professionally cast for’), is perfect. When they were announced, there was bafflement over the choice of Lily James for Anderson and Sebastian Stan for Lee – they both have such thoughtful faces, how could they possibly play two gorgeous 90s dumbasses? – but they are both on top form. They are magnetically attracted to each other, and play lovestruck honeymooners like two feral animals who communicate in grunts. In the episode where they fall in love, they barely even talk. It’s so, so good. Plotting unseen behind them, Rogen plays a character who isn’t a chuckling stoner for once, and he’s all the better for it. Gauthier, working on the remodel of Lee’s house, is hurt by his failure to pay in advance (again, Stan plays this perfectly: every time he prowls on screen he is at once sweetly simple and unknowingly threatening – always two steps away from holding a hunting rifle while wearing a leopard-print kimono and saying: “I’m joking, dude!”) and too straightforward to know what he’s doing is cold, naked revenge. Giving each character all that screen time lets us add layers to who they are and their motivations: did I need to know Gauthier is still pining for an ex and Lee is dreading the rise of Seattle grunge? How much of Anderson’s barely seen frailty after being dismissed on the Baywatch set did I really need to see? But in an era of Marvel megamovies (also starring Stan, also available on Disney+), it’s nice to watch something that doesn’t just assign goodies and baddies. We spend eight hours learning various shades of grey while Rogen wears a sick mullet and gets a succession of big fits off. That’s what TV can do that films can’t. Here’s another thing TV can do that films would struggle with: an extended sequence in which Stan talks to his own CGI penis (the “mouth” of the penis is exactly what you think it is). I suppose this is what Disney started the Star umbrella for: to get away from all-ages kids movies and show people on ecstasy having sex in a bath, which is most of episode two. Again, I back the gratuitousness of it: if you’re going to pivot to adult themes after 70-plus years of Snow White, go hard or go home. You do sort of feel like that high, shrieking sound is Walt Disney’s snap-frozen head revolving at high speed, but that’s not a problem for me to solve. That’s for Disneyland to figure out how to make a rollercoaster out of this series, somehow. Could it have been a film? Quite easily. Could it have been shorter? Oh, significantly. Is there something to be said for letting everyone have the time of their life and letting the fun go on for as long as possible? Pam & Tommy really does argue convincingly so. I didn’t think I’d say this, but: can every story be way too long now? Can we all just switch to baths again instead of showers?",Arts/Television & radio,Pam & Tommy: Disney’s sex tape tale makes for outrageous and unmissable TV,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/29/pam-tommy-disneys-sex-tape-tale-makes-for-outrageous-and-unmissable-tv
1/29/2022,"January comfort food can be lots of things. I frequently find metaphorical hugs in rich and savoury, or in cheesy and creamy dishes; things that welcome us with a warm, rounded embrace, countering the sharper side of winter. There’s quite a bit going on in today’s first dish – tart, bitter, chilli and crunch – but ultimately it all sinks into an ambrosial puddle of beans, while the second is gloriously beige. Both are low effort and high reward.  Prep 10 minCook 15 minServes 2 100g sourdough or focaccia4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling1 fat garlic clove, peeled and crushed1 tsp chilli flakes400g cooked white haricot beans (drained weight)75ml single cream (or 50ml more water)2 sprigs sage or rosemary (optional)1 tsp ground black peppercorns35g grated parmesan1 medium radicchio (about 500g), quartered, cored and leaves separated3 tbsp moscatel, sherry or thin balsamic vinegarFlaky sea salt Pulse the bread in a food processor until relatively fine. Put three tablespoons of the oil in a large frying pan set over a medium-high heat for 45 seconds or so, then add the breadcrumbs, toss to coat and fry for three to four minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden. Turn down the heat to low, stir in the garlic and chilli flakes, and about a minute later transfer to a bowl. Wipe the pan clean with kitchen towel. Drain the beans, reserving any liquid. Top up that liquid with cream (if using) and/or water to total 225ml. Put the beans, the liquid and the sage or rosemary, if using, in a saucepan and bring to an energetic simmer. Add the pepper and parmesan, shake the pan to incorporate the cheese, leave to thicken for a minute, then take off the heat.Return the frying pan to a medium-high heat. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil and the radicchio leaves, then use tongs to turn them over for 60 seconds, so each one touches the hot pan and becomes glossy. Create a gap in the middle, add the vinegar and another tablespoon of water, take off the heat and swiftly move the leaves around the pan so they wilt further in the steam. Add a sprinkling of sea salt. Divide the beans between two shallow bowls or plates with rims. Top with the leaves and any pan juices, scatter masses of crumbs over the top (you’ll add any that you don’t use now halfway through eating) and serve.

Lay in the chicken pieces skin side down and leave to fry for 13-15 minutes without touching them – this will ensure the skin turns golden and crisp. Transfer the chicken to a plate, then add the shallots, celeriac, garlic and a heavy pinch of salt to the pan and fry, stirring occasionally, for three to four minutes. Create a space, pour in the wine, let that bubble and steam for 30 seconds, then scrape and deglaze the base of the pan. Add 600ml water, half the tarragon and the preserved lemon, return the chicken to the pot skin side up, prodding the pieces down so they’re part-submerged but with the skin clear of the liquid. Part cover with a lid and leave to cook at a gentle simmer for 20 minutes. After that time, lift out the chicken pieces and rest on a clean plate. Pick out and discard the spent tarragon. Pick and finely chop the leaves from the remaining herbs, then stir them through the mix with the chickpeas, vinegar and tahini. Check for seasoning, add salt, vinegar and tahini to taste (you should notice the nutty savouriness of the tahini, but it shouldn’t dominate).

1/29/2022,"In a small Welsh town far, far away (perhaps), preparations are in hand to tell the story of how one of the most famous and beloved movie spaceships was secretly built in an old aircraft hangar. A permanent exhibition is to open later this year explaining how the Millennium Falcon that appeared in the Star Wars film The Empire Strikes Back came to be constructed from wood and steel by engineers in Pembroke Dock, in south-west Wales.  Local craftspeople working under a veil of secrecy were ordered to refer to the ship as “Magic Roundabout” but, inevitably in a small town, word seeped out. “It was the worst-kept secret in Pembroke Dock – everybody in the town knew they were building a UFO in the hangar,” said Gareth Mills, a trustee of the Pembroke Dock Heritage Trust. “That period of time and that story is an important part of the town’s living memory. The exhibition, once opened, will provide a significant boost for Pembroke Dock, with increased visitor numbers helping with the economic regeneration of our town and will also have major benefits for Pembrokeshire.” Mark Williams, a local Star Wars expert who will oversee the project, said: “George Lucas set a new standard in both storytelling and film-making with Star Wars, and the story of the Millennium Falcon being built in Pembroke Dock was big news at the time. The whole world knew about it, then the story faded into legend. “The idea of a town in west Wales making a significant contribution to this incredible story by being the place where one of the most iconic starships in science-fiction history was built creates a mixture of disbelief, awe and pride.” The National Lottery Heritage Fund is providing £8,000 to help the project, which will tell the story with photographs, film, props and costumes. The spaceship itself will not be there but in the future crowdfunding campaigns may be launched to try to to recreate sets from The Empire Strikes Back. After it was built in Wales, the Falcon was split into pieces and driven to the film set in Hertfordshire. The Millennium Falcon isn’t Pembrokeshire’s only connection to Star Wars. Lynwen Brennan, Lucasfilm’s executive vice-president and general manager, has close family links to Pembroke Dock. “I am so delighted that this wonderful moment and place in Star Wars history will be preserved,” Brennan said. “I love that such an iconic, beloved ship was built in the town where my mum was born and in the county where I grew up, and I’m hopeful this exhibit will become a new destination for fans around the world.”",News/UK news,Welsh town to retell tale of how it built Star Wars’ Millennium Falcon,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/29/welsh-town-pembroke-dock-how-it-built-star-wars-millennium-falcon
1/29/2022,"Albania has been on the radar for intrepid backpackers for some time, but this year tour operators are predicting the south-eastern Balkan country will become a mainstream holiday destination for UK travellers after a surge in bookings this January. Interest in the country has been gradually building over the past decade as it has slowly opened up after a 44-year dictatorship that ended in 1985. Tour operators have seen a notable increase in bookings for 2022 as Albania extends its appeal to people seeking beautiful beaches and landscapes as well as interesting culture and history at a lower price than neighbouring destinations.  “Albania is one of those small and diverse destinations that can offer a bit of everything to everyone, similar to Montenegro or Slovenia,” said Tine Murn, a co-founder of New Deal Europe, a marketing agency for Balkan tourism. He said Albania appealed because it was a “Mediterranean undiscovered gem” and “still holds a sense of the exotic, even though it is geographically very close”. This was especially appealing at the moment while people were reluctant to travel long haul owing to the pandemic, not least because Albania has had very low Covid infection rates and no restrictions for most of the pandemic, he said. Albania’s national tourism agency sees the UK as “an emerging growing market” and has actively promoted tourism in recent years. The country is also becoming much easier to travel around as the standard of its accommodation has improved and spending on infrastructure has increased, with a new road connecting the western mountains with the eastern coastline due to open this year. The UK’s large Albanian diaspora and vocal celebrity champions such as the Southampton footballer Armando Broja and the pop stars Dua Lipa and Rita Ora have further helped raise the country’s profile. Flights from the UK to the capital, Tirana, are increasingly available and in demand. The bookings website Skyscanner said it had seen a 48% increase in bookings to Albania compared with 2019, reflecting interest in “less popular destinations which are traditionally considered off the beaten track”. Average bookings were for 2.1 people, suggesting mostly couples and friends are booking at present. However, Elton Caushi, who runs the Tirana-based tour operator Albanian Trip, said visitors had “significantly shifted” in recent years from backpackers to families, especially from EU countries, and British families were now increasingly visible. “Croatia came on to the map at the end of the ex-Yugoslavian conflicts, Bulgaria and Romania surprised Europe with their beauty and history when they became part of the EU, and now the continent is eager to discover more. The day has come for one of the very last secrets of Europe,” he said. Zina Bencheikh, the managing director for Europe at Intrepid Travel, said there been an increase in bookings this year partly due to the fact Albania offers adventure without the carbon footprint of a long-haul flight, as people were “more conscious than ever of the environmental impact of their holiday”. Wild Frontiers, one of the first operators to launch tours in Albania, said inquiries for its week-long guided trips – the only ones it offers below £1,000 – were up 30% on last January. Its founder, Jonny Bealby, said the country was “set to boom” in the coming years. He said Albania had come a long way since the Communist era. He recalled that when he first started running trips in the country 12 years ago, tourist infrastructure was completely absent. Instead, he relied on a Channel 4 News fixer who had worked on the Balkan wars to help him organise accommodation and transport. He sees Albania as part of a new wave of destinations, including Georgia, Slovakia and Pakistan, that are growing in popularity as travellers look to escape an excess tourists. “These were countries that were very niche destinations a decade ago and now they’re becoming more mainstream as people look for quirky and different places and to get away from the crowds.” Delve into Albania’s rich past by visiting hilltop towns and fortresses such as Krüje, the country’s first capital, or Gjirokastër and Berat. There are also Greek and Roman ruins in Apollonia and Butrint. For insight into the country’s more recent history under the Communist dictator Enver Hoxha, explore one of the many bunkers built to protect citizens by the paranoid regime, dotted throughout the landscape. The Albanian Alps are a spectacular mountain range with excellent hiking trails that will lead you around some of Europe’s cleanest rivers, remote villages and stunning views. Albania also has several large lakes – Ohrid, Prespa and Shkodra – to explore. A new road, Arber, is opening in 2022 that will connect the west and east sides of the country and the traditional heartland in the mountains with its more modern coastline. There’s plenty to see and do in Tirana, which is safe, walkable and feels buzzy without being overrun by tourists. There’s a thriving bar and restaurant scene, especially in the Blloku district, and plenty of museums to visit. Tirana is the European Youth Capital for 2022 and will host a programme of arts and culinary events, and concerts by Dua Lipa and Rita Ora. Like other Adriatic nations, Albania has a long and beautiful stretch of coastline with turquoise sea and lovely beaches, and with fewer crowds there is more likely to be ample space for your towel, too. Albania has developed a distinctive culture after being isolated from other European countries for so long, partly due to its mountain range, which kept outside influence at bay. Albanian cuisine is a surprising blend of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern flavours based on high-quality produce, often sourced from chaotic local bazaars. The country is also an increasingly popular destination for music festivals, including the Unum electronic music festival.",News/World news,UK tourists head to Albania for ‘sense of exotic’ without long-haul flight,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/29/uk-tourists-head-to-albania-for-sense-of-exotic-without-long-haul-flight
1/29/2022,"Cyclists and pedestrians are better protected as of Saturday as a revamp of the Highway Code comes into force, despite concerns that millions of drivers are confused by or unaware of the changes. An AA survey of more than 13,700 drivers carried out this month indicated that 33% were unaware of the changes, including 4% who had “no intention” of looking at the details.  A communications drive will be launched by the Department for Transport’s road safety offshoot Think! in mid-February, and there will be further campaigns in the summer. As part of the revamp in England, Scotland and Wales, cars are expected to give way when pedestrians are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions, while cyclists are advised to ride in the centre of lanes on quieter roads, in slower-moving traffic, and when approaching junctions, to make themselves as visible as possible. The guidance also introduces a hierarchy of types of road users based on which is likely to cause most harm in the event of a collision, meaning someone driving will be expected to watch out for people cycling, walking, or riding a horse, and cyclists will need to be aware of pedestrians. Nine sections of the Highway Code, which contains advice and rules for people on Britain’s roads, have been updated, with 50 rules added or amended. The changes are advisory, so non-compliance will not result in a fine. The AA’s president, Edmund King, voiced concern at the potential impact of the guidance to give way to pedestrians at junctions, saying it risked collisions, since drivers who stopped to allow someone to cross on dual carriageways or fast-flowing A roads were “likely to get hit by another vehicle from behind”. He said pedestrians could be endangered if one driver gave way but another travelling in the opposite direction failed to stop. “Drivers will have to make their own judgments on what they should do in the scenarios they find themselves in,” King told the PA news agency. “However, if the judgments of the driver and the pedestrian are at odds on a very busy road, this could lead to problems.” The roads minister, Lady Vere, said this week that the updated Highway Code would make Britain’s roads safer and encourage people to “respect and consider the needs of those around them”. The charity Cycling UK said the changes must be “communicated with simple, accurate and memorable messaging”. Hierarchy of road usersPeople in charge of vehicles that can cause the most harm in the event of a collision have the greatest responsibility to look out for other road users. Walking, cycling or riding in shared spacesCyclists should not overtake people walking or riding a horse in shared spaces closely or at high speed, and pedestrians should not obstruct paths. Positioning of cyclistsCyclists should make themselves as visible as possible by riding in the centre of lanes on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and at the approach to junctions. Pedestrians crossingTraffic should give way when people are waiting to cross at junctions, updating the earlier guidance that applied only to those who have already stepped out on to the crossing. Traffic must give way to people on zebra crossings. Overtaking cyclistsDrivers travelling at speeds of up to 30mph should leave at least 1.5 metres when overtaking cyclists. They should give more space when overtaking at higher speeds. Opening car doorsCar occupants should open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder. This technique, known as the Dutch reach, reduces the chances of doors being opened into the path of cyclists and motorcyclists. Overtaking cyclists at junctionsWhen cyclists are travelling straight ahead at a junction, they have priority over traffic waiting to turn into or out of a side road, unless road signs or markings indicate otherwise. Cycling in groupsThe new text makes clear that people cycling can ride two abreast but should be considerate of the needs of other road users when in groups. RoundaboutsDrivers should take extra care when entering roundabouts to make sure they do not cut across cyclists.

1/29/2022,"Faced with cuts to her universal credit and crippling bills, in September last year Amy Cook, 27, decided to do something she had never done before to help her family: she set up a crowdfunding campaign to help alleviate their financial situation. Cook, a full-time carer to her partner, Jordan, 37, who has learning difficulties, set a £2,000 goal on the crowdfunding platform GoFundMe. On her profile she explained to potential donors that the family had “hit a brick wall” with a bedbug infestation followed by cuts to their universal credit, adding that it would be “10 times harder to survive let alone live”.  Cook, who lives in Deptford, London, explained that the couple had depleted their “rainy day fund” and needed a “helping hand to get back to an acceptable standard of living”. This included carpeting the home as Jordan has grand mal epilepsy, which causes him to have fits, and they were concerned that the seizures could lead to a serious head injury. “We have no funds to live off,” says Cook, who has a daughter aged eight. “We approached the council and housing association but there was no support anywhere … The minute the money is there it’s gone; you’re always a month behind on your bills. You pay one bill then another comes straight in. There’s not enough support for people in poverty.” She turned to GoFundMe as a last resort. “I was nervous as I’m not a person to ask strangers for help but what else can I do? The government isn’t doing anything.” The couple reached their goal, allowing them to resolve the bed bug situation, buy a new chest of drawers, washing machine and other essential items. Research for the Guardian by GoFundMe found a 28% rise in the number of appeals mentioning universal credit appearing on the platform between July 2021 and January 2022 compared with the pre-pandemic period of July 2019 to January 2020. The appeals come against a backdrop of rising prices for essentials such as gas and food, and after cuts in benefits, including last autumn’s removal of the £20 universal credit uplift. John Coventry, the senior international director at GoFundMe, says the trend of people turning to crowdfunding for help with everyday living costs is not surprising as the website “generally holds up a mirror to society – so whatever issues people face we’ll see that reflected in the activity on the platform”. He adds: “It will be a tough winter for many people and as such we would expect more fundraisers for basic household needs. Some of the stories are heartbreaking but the power it gives people when communities rally around to help is truly inspiring. “There are some incredible stories of kindness playing out every single day all over the world and that, in turn, makes people more confident to ask for the help they need.” Jackie*, 27, lives in Yorkshire and launched a successful crowdfunding appeal last autumn to raise £1,000 to help her pay for rent and food. “I turned to GoFundMe because the amount from universal credit is so little,” she says. “The stress and anxiety of not knowing each month what I will be able to cover for bills and so on is just crazy. Having the GoFundMe is embarrassing and I feel ashamed to ask people to share it but I didn’t know what else I could do.” Jackie is far from the only one turning to crowdfunding platforms to survive. Rob Rider Hill, a former chef and musician, 40, set up a campaign to raise £350 to help cover costs to repair his broken iPhone and laptop screens. Rider Hill, who has long Covid, is unable to return to work as a chef and is taking on small ad hoc admin projects for friends. He is reliant on the £644 a month he receives in universal credit, out of which he pays £370 in rent. He describes the process of organising and receiving universal credit as a “nightmare”, adding “it’s been the most stressful part of the last year and a half”. Dependent on friends, food banks and the local community cafe, when his laptop screen broke and he couldn’t afford to fix it he wanted to try a different way to raise funds. “Basically, 90% of my world is my laptop as I’m in my room 90% of the time,” says Rider Hill, who lives in Leyton, London. With the money that was donated he bought a new monitor for £300 as it was too expensive to fix the screen itself and bought a refurbished iPhone. “If the pandemic had happened 10 years earlier it would have been harder but now we have the infrastructure to set things up online.” Ruth Patrick, a lecturer in social policy and social work at the University of York, says people are using crowdfunding to plug gaps in government support. “We have a government that is very much focused on providing support to working families but ignoring help for families that for whatever reason can’t work, or people whose parents are disabled or people caring for children who are disabled or have young children,” Patrick says. “It doesn’t surprise me that people are turning to crowdfunding.” Still, she warns that crowdfunding is not a long-term solution. “There’s a lot of shame and stigma to this,” she says. “It’s much better to have a decent level of income to support you and your family. We need to go back to having a social security system that’s fit for purpose. We need to reverse the £20 cut and increase child benefits.” However, with gas and electricity bills rising, the future looks bleak for many. “Millions will be struggling this winter,” Patrick says. A government spokesperson says: “Universal credit offers a vital safety net to millions of people, enabling them to support themselves and their families while building towards financial independence through work. It ensures fairness for both claimants and the taxpayer, and the changes we have made [in December] will see nearly 2 million working universal credit claimants better off by about £1,000 a year on average.” * Name has been changed.",Lifestyle/Money,Universal credit claimants turn to crowdfunding to meet living costs,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/29/universal-credit-claimants-turn-to-crowdfunding-to-meet-living-costs
1/29/2022,"Until the spring of 2020, Rebecca Handford’s then two-year-old daughter Eadie was happily spending three days a week being looked after by her grandparents, enjoying trips out, and going to cafes. But then came the first lockdown, and her world closed in overnight. The family, who live in a small village on the border between Cheshire and Derbyshire, felt lucky to have a garden for Eadie to play in – although, as Handford ruefully puts it, while she was trying to work from home “Mr Tumble did a lot of the heavy lifting”.  Eadie is an only child, and her language came on in leaps and bounds due to spending so much time with her parents. But Handford worries that she missed out on learning to socialise. “If there’s a little gang of toddlers running around, she very much doesn’t want to take part. Even if we go to the park, if there’s another child on the slide she will go and play somewhere else until it’s free.” Eadie has grown more confident since starting preschool, but still prefers the company of adults. Like many parents, Handford and her husband wonder if this is temporary or whether the pandemic has in some ways shaped the person Eadie will grow up to be. Something similar is true for Emily Knight and her husband. They spent the first lockdown at home in Grantham, Lincolnshire, working from home while juggling a baby and a two-year-old between them. When restrictions lifted last summer, Knight, who works for an MP, discovered that after so long without seeing other people, her children found being in a busy supermarket overwhelming. “My youngest screams at the notion of going near a swimming pool. Stuff that you build up with very small children to get them used to it – they haven’t had that,” she says. “They haven’t really interacted with people who aren’t in their immediate family. I now have a four-year-old who cowers in fear when a shopkeeper says hello to him.” While many parents were initially concerned that Covid precautions such as constant hand-washing might have a psychological impact on children, Knight says these didn’t worry her children. “They’re always saying, ‘Don’t forget your mask, Mummy’ – that’s normal for them. And everywhere we go, they just hold their hands out to get some gel.” It’s returning to what adults consider normality that seems confusing for children who have grown up in the shadow of a pandemic. For many under fives, life before masks and hand sanitiser is but a faint memory. Babies born in lockdown, to mothers forced to go into labour alone while their partners waited helplessly in hospital car parks, will now be approaching their second birthdays. And while the last two summers have spelled a return to something like normality for these children, the winters have brought brutal setbacks. It’s perhaps only now, as restrictions lift again, that researchers are beginning to understand what this disorienting start in life may have meant for them. According to a YouGov survey [PDF] after last spring’s lockdown, British parents worry much less about small children catching the virus than about the impact of the pandemic on their development; a quarter thought it would set their language back, while half had concerns about emotional and social skills – things such as learning to share, take turns and make friends. Other fears pertain to how growing up in a climate of constant anxiety has affected their children’s mental health, or whether they’ll be behind when they start school. After the first Covid wave in 2020 – which saw nurseries closed to all but key workers’ and vulnerable children for up to six months – the Education Endowment Foundation, a social mobility charity, asked schools about the children who were starting reception that autumn. Three-quarters of the schools surveyed [PDF] reported that new starters were behind in speech, writing and number skills, as well as the ability to focus and behave in class. The big question, however, is whether “Covid babies” are young enough to shake off their strange early experiences, or whether their generation will in some sense be defined by it. On a chilly, clear winter’s day, a huddle of preschoolers bundled up in coats and bobble hats dig excitedly in the mud. Around them, toddlers zoom up and down on trikes. Since the pandemic began, staff at Old Station nursery in the Oxfordshire market town of Faringdon have encouraged them to play outside as much as possible. But that’s not the only way in which life has had to change. The nursery stayed open for all but the first 12 weeks of the pandemic, reopening in June 2020 stripped of any cushions, rugs and soft furnishings thought likely to harbour the virus. Even the sandpit was banned, although it has since made a comeback amid greater understanding of the way Covid spreads. One of the staff wrote a storybook, explaining what the children’s favourite character, Maisie Mouse, has to do to keep the “big bug” away. (They have been honest about the virus from the start, knowing the children would have heard their parents talking about it.) The children also played a game of smearing paint on their hands, pretending it was a bug, and noticing how it ended up on everything they touched. For staff, that initial reopening at a time when there was still no vaccine against Covid-19 was terrifying. “Everyone was saying: ‘Keep your distance.’ But how can you do that with a baby?” recalls the nursery’s warm and reassuring manager, Stephanie Dorling. But what mattered, she decided at the time, was trying to compensate for what the children had lost during lockdown. “We felt we had to fill that void. So we did the most crazy summer of events and themed weeks. We just got everybody involved, did lots of fancy dress, had barbecues, gave them the experiences they might not have been having at home. We thought, ‘If this is the only place they’re going, we’d better pack in lots of really exciting things.’ Nonetheless, she noticed significant changes in some children after three months at home. “Emotional detachment has been really hard – things like finding it difficult to leave parents. Some have been a little quieter, more withdrawn. There’s a lot more anxiety in the three- and four-year-olds; you can see that they worry about things.” Some of the youngest had barely seen another baby, and found a room full of them overwhelming. And then there was an unexpected side-effect of the extra screen time most children will have experienced. “We had children talking in American accents, because they’d been watching so much YouTube,” Dorling says. A year and half on from reopening, Dorling thinks most of her charges have either caught up or are held back chiefly by shyness. “If they engage in an activity, they’re perfectly able, it’s just their confidence,” she says. “Children have more resilience than we think.” Nonetheless, she is conscious that they aren’t out of the woods yet. When I visit in December 2021, the Omicron variant is only just hitting the headlines in England, but Dorling is braced for what she suspects is coming. Nurseries have been on the frontline of the pandemic, enabling other key worker parents to do their jobs as well as overseeing the early education of children too young to learn by Zoom. But that comes at a price. By the end of November, Covid-19 rates in early-years settings in England had already passed their previous peak. Unlike older children, under-fives are not eligible for vaccination. “There’s been no letup in the early years; it’s constant – the same pressure the whole way through,” Dorling says. “When I look at the team, I can see they’re exhausted. You just think, ‘One more thing is going to break the camel’s back’.” She finds it strange that while the early years are widely deemed critical to life chances – children learn faster between birth and age five than at any other stage of life – there is little public discussion of how the pandemic is shaping a generation born into it. If Covid has had a genuinely lasting impact on children’s development, then the Babylab project based at Oxford Brookes University should be among the first to know. Ordinarily, this collaboration between academics at five English universities recruits families of preschoolers to study aspects of development, from the benefits of napping to growing up bilingual. When the pandemic hit, they were instantly curious about the impact of what would presumably be a relatively brief interlude in toddlers’ lives. More than 18 months on, they are still tracking the effect of social distancing on what was originally a cohort of 600 under-threes, via games that parents are asked to play to assess their children’s skills. Its early work confirmed the first lockdown may well have had an impact on children learning to talk. Toddlers still attending nursery at least two days a week in lockdown – because their parents were key workers, for example – could be expected to learn on average 48 more new words than those stuck at home, with children from the poorest backgrounds hardest hit. Those attending five days a week could increase executive function scores – tests of skills such as concentrating, or controlling their emotions – by nearly twice as much as others. The next wave of research, exploring how the same children have fared since nurseries reopened, is still being conducted and results are not expected until spring. But Babylab’s Dr Alexandra Hendry, a research fellow in psychology at the University of Oxford and a mother of two school-age children herself, is optimistic. “That’s what everyone is interested in – do we see recovery and resilience, which is what I’m hoping for and what I’m expecting, to be honest,” she says over Zoom from her home office. “I’m really on board with the message that the first three years really, really matter. But parents can hear from that, ‘If you don’t get there early, it’s too late’, and that’s not true. There’s not a door that shuts. It’s never too late to expose your child to the kind of enriching experiences they get from early years childcare settings.” That chimes with December 2021’s annual report from Ofsted, noting that while almost half of early years providers in England thought children had fallen behind on skills such as sharing toys or following a routine, they noted improvements by autumn. Some preschoolers even mastered new skills during lockdown, or returned happier for having spent more time with their parents. The good news for parents of shy toddlers, Hendry says, is that the human drive to be social is “one of the most robust and recoverable” instincts small children have. Nor should parents who struggled to work from home in lockdown beat themselves up about the amount of Paw Patrol their toddlers may have watched. “We demonise screen time because that’s a simple story, but it’s more complex than that,” she says, “there are benefits and there are disadvantages. No parent I’ve spoken to, myself included, parented in a way that was their optimal style during lockdown. We’re all having to make compromises.” What about parents worried that younger children missed out on early educational activities, such as baby music classes? While babies should have been able to get the social interaction they needed within the family, she argues, it’s frazzled parents for whom such classes can be a lifeline. “I took my kids to baby pilates because I was bored and tired and lonely. In a way, we need to be directing our attention towards parents, because that’s where the negative effects might get passed on to a child, if the parent is struggling.” Her team found that, where parents were coping well, some families actively thrived on more time together. “We’d hear, ‘My child’s language has flourished’ or ‘It’s been brilliant because her dad’s been home all the time, and I’m on maternity leave and I was lonely before.’” (Two-thirds of fathers in two-parent households in the UK reported better relationships with their children as a result of being home more during lockdown, a recent survey by the campaign group the Fatherhood Institute found.) But the risk, Hendry says, is of existing inequalities deepening as lockdown widens the gap between families where the parents are coping well, and those in far more difficult circumstances. The story of what happened to children in the pandemic is, in some ways, really the story of what happened to their parents. For Leah, giving birth in a pandemic was never going to be easy. Registered blind and disabled, Leah (who is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns) had previously struggled with their mental health and was supported by specialist mental heath midwives during their second pregnancy, but found raising a baby in lockdown tough. Their eight-year-old daughter is, Leah says, “incredibly outgoing”, but at 18 months, her little brother is clingy and anxious. “If I leave the room, there’s hysteria. With her, we were out and about every day doing something, even if it was just meeting up with another baby or going for a walk around the supermarket. Family and friends were in and out constantly. Whereas he first met my brother when he was eight months old.” Even when the mother and baby group at their local community centre reopened after the first lockdown, numbers were strictly limited and attendance had to be pre-booked. It was hard to find help when the baby had trouble feeding, too. “Our local breastfeeding group did a lot of Zooms, but when people are saying ‘Watch this video’ – I can’t see that.” Leah’s health visitor has been “amazing”, but they worry about the impact on other families of not seeing professionals face to face. “Phone calls are all well and good, but you miss out on the body language. How many kids will slip through the net? I had to take him to A&E with croup, and there were a number of kids that you could hear there were safeguarding concerns around: parents being interrogated about how their kids got marks on them.” Amid fears of a spike in postnatal depression among lonely new parents, restrictions were eased after the first lockdown, allowing families to form “childcare bubbles” for extra support. Under-fives were also excluded from the “rule of six” limit on socialising last winter. But giving birth in a pandemic has still been an acutely lonely experience for many new parents, deprived of help from grandparents and struggling to make friends while playgroups were closed. Many have also struggled to see GPs or health visitors in person, according to a UK-wide survey of professionals working with children published last autumn by the Parent-Infant Foundation. A third said weekly drop‑in clinics had shut down permanently during lockdown, while more than a quarter said local health visitors were still only available over the phone or online. The report’s co-author, Sally Hogg, says paediatricians she interviewed have expressed concerns not just about potentially serious conditions being missed, but also cases “where there’s absolutely nothing wrong with the baby, and the mum should just have been able to go to a mums’ group and say, ‘Does your child throw up after feeds or never sleep?’ They’ve no sounding board, and eventually they get so worried they end up in A&E.” The recent deaths of 16-month-old Star Hobson in Bradford and six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes in Solihull also tragically illustrate the risks of vulnerable children falling under the radar during lockdown. There has been a 31% rise in so-called serious incident notifications (where abuse or neglect is suspected) for babies in their first year, and while social services tried to prioritise high-risk families during lockdown, Hogg points out that not all risks are known. She says: “If this is your first baby, how does anyone know your kids are OK if they’ve not been seen since they were discharged from hospital?” Meanwhile, take-up of free nursery places for two-year-olds – offered to families in deprived neighbourhoods, to help narrow the gap between rich and poor children’s life chances – has fallen sharply since early 2020, reflecting what Hogg fears may be a broader disengagement with children’s services in some communities. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, promised £300m in last autumn’s budget for early years projects championed by Andrea Leadsom, the former business secretary who chaired a recent review of early years [PDF] for the government; these include so-called family hubs providing one-stop support for vulnerable families in England. The Department for Education has also launched a £153m early years recovery programme, including specialist speech and language therapy for reception pupils, and has prioritised keeping nurseries as well as schools open during subsequent lockdowns. But many in the early years sector argue it isn’t enough to meet the ongoing need. Calls to Parent Talk, the helpline run by the charity Action for Children, have increased fourfold during the pandemic. In a UK-wide survey it ran last autumn, half of parents reported feelings of anxiety, and a third felt isolated or depressed, with parents of preschoolers harder hit than parents of older children. “We’re getting a lot of mental health concerns, physical exhaustion, lack of support, feelings of isolation. It often comes up as ‘I can’t cope’ or ‘I don’t know what else I can do’,” says Jo Thurston, service coordinator for Parent Talk. “The stress of parenting in an uncertain environment is really taking a toll.” She says common problems raised during lockdown include separation anxiety, difficult behaviour at home, and being slow to meet developmental milestones such as learning to talk. A post-lockdown surge of referrals for services such as speech therapy has meant delays as they work through the backlog. And every time the NHS frantically reshuffles its resources to face a fresh wave of Covid, families of sick or disabled children fear disruption to existing treatment. Three-year-old Sam was born with a rare condition known as Pallister-Killian syndrome; he is partially blind, needs hearing aids and suffers from hypotonia, a muscle weakness that means he can’t move himself independently or talk. Before Covid, he was having three physiotherapy sessions a week to keep him mobile. But then his NHS physiotherapist was diverted on to a Covid ward, and a charity-funded scheme that was also helping the family shut down, something they fear may have actively shortened his life. “The thing that eats away at you with kids with special needs is that you might not be able to make it up,” says Sam’s father, Matt, a civil servant. “Mobility translates into lifespan – if you don’t move around, you don’t develop healthy organs. I’m saying this distancing myself from it, so I don’t cry, but we will never know the opportunity lost. Could he have had more time? What opportunities were missed for his development? The less a kid like him moves, the shorter his life will be.” The end of lockdown, meanwhile, brought some difficult choices for the family as they weighed the benefits to their two older daughters of going out and seeing friends against the risk of bringing the virus home to Sam, who is highly clinically vulnerable. “We made a decision that we would take precautions, but we couldn’t isolate, because we just couldn’t survive,” Matt says. Matt stresses that the family don’t blame the NHS. “Sam’s physio was on a Covid ward, massaging people’s lungs to keep them alive – there’s no way we wouldn’t have wanted that to happen.” Thankfully, Sam now attends a special needs school that offers the therapy he needs. But for many parents of disabled children who have got this far running on adrenaline, Matt thinks the strain is beginning to tell. “I’m smoking my head off as we speak,” he says. For families who have experienced difficult lockdowns, the constant threat of further restrictions has been particularly frightening. Anna Waterman’s daughter Megan turned five just before the UK’s March 2020 lockdown and was, her mother says, “a very happy, cheeky little girl. She never had any issues with social interaction, no anxiety at all.” The first lockdown passed off uneventfully, says Waterman, who runs a travel business and lives in London. But the second, in England in January 2021, was very different. Full days of Zoom lessons left Megan feeling overwhelmed and panicky. “At that age, you can’t teach phonics online. She was really starting to hate the screen time. Thirty kids on a Zoom – it was noisy, she didn’t want to say anything, she didn’t want the camera on.” The school reopened that spring, but repeated Covid outbreaks meant the children kept being sent home to isolate, and Megan struggled with the uncertainty. “You couldn’t go to the library and choose a book because the library was shut. You couldn’t play with a different child because they were in a different bubble. Every time you wanted to do something, it was ‘no’. One day she came home from school and said, ‘Mummy, thousands of children have died, did you know that?’” In July, she began refusing to eat food that needed chewing. “She was utterly convinced that it would get stuck in her throat and she would choke and die. She ate less and less, until she was just eating nothing. I thought, ‘I need help, I don’t know what to do.’” But the family GP wasn’t seeing patients face to face, and it took days to get a phone appointment. Although Megan was then referred to child and adolescent mental health services, Waterman says she was told in August 2021 that nobody could see her until January. “If she’d fallen out of a tree and broken her arm, she would be in A&E and in plaster within eight hours. But they were saying there was nobody available. All they could say was: ‘Keep weighing her, and when it gets really bad, go to A&E.’” After Megan started saying that she was scared to even drink water, the family turned to a private therapist. But, as her mother points out, for many families that isn’t an option. “I rang every helpline and charity on offer. Even the private services are completely stacked. It shocked me. I’d believed what the leaders of our country say – that these services exist. I felt like saying to them: ‘You try getting help.’” Megan returned to school in autumn 2021, and has been doing well, although she remains anxious about the virus. “She asks me: ‘Has Covid gone away?’ “We try to explain that it hasn’t, but it will become like flu – something that we live with. But it’s hard to understand at that age,” Waterman says. For some young children, the most difficult legacy of Covid may be an emotional one, accepting that life can be unpredictable and that there are questions even grownups can’t answer. Stuck to the wall behind Beccy Smith’s head when she joins me on Zoom is a child’s drawing of an orange robot. It’s the work of her six-year-old son Jasper, who is now in his third year of interrupted schooling. His experience growing up in a pandemic inspired his mother – who runs the Brighton-based Touched theatre company – to produce a puppet theatre show aimed at helping other families make sense of it. The Gift, originally planned for Christmas 2020, opened in front of a painstakingly socially distanced audience of two- to four-year-olds at Manchester’s Z-Arts theatre last December. While it doesn’t overtly mention Covid, her show tells the story of a lonely astronaut, isolated in space. He is watched over by a kindly star who appears throughout on a screen, representing loved ones children may have only been able to see via FaceTime. The star sends the astronaut a robot to keep him company. Even children too young to articulate their feelings about Covid should be able to recognise the emotions in the play, Smith says. “A lot of them have fears and worries about the virus, and we didn’t want to make a show about fear and worry. We wanted to make a show that reminded children how much they are loved, even when the people who love them are far away.” Giving children chances to process their feelings through games and songs and stories is, she argues, a way of helping them move on. “Cultural experiences can be very healing, and can be part of the way we find out of this.” They may be just as important for their parents, some of whom will be feeling guilt or grief for the childhoods their children didn’t get to have, or are watching anxiously for signs of long-term damage. While many young children are likely to bounce back unscathed, there is growing evidence that the pandemic has deepened inequalities between vulnerable and more fortunate families, and that recovery from it is likely to strain services from daycare to mental health for years to come. When her daughter was ill, Waterman says, she simply lived from mealtime to mealtime. It was only when Megan began to recover that she and her husband finally began to absorb what had happened, leaving her with a fierce desire to let other families who struggled in lockdown know they’re not alone. “As a parent of young children, you feel like you’re the only one who’s losing it. Now, when I talk to other parents and tell them what we went through, you see that flicker of relief if they had a horrendous experience, too – relief that it’s not something they’ve done as a parent, it’s a result of this situation that no one could have foreseen,” she tells me. “You look back and think, ‘Oh my God, what have we just been through?’”  Some names have been changed.",News/World news,‘My son cowers when a shopkeeper says hello’ – are the toddlers of Covid all right?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/29/my-son-cowers-when-a-shopkeeper-says-hello-are-the-toddlers-of-covid-all-right
