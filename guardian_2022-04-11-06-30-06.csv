4/11/2022,"The look on Tiger Woods’s face as he walked off the 18th green told you all you need to know about what he’s been through in the last 14 months. Woods had just shot his second consecutive round of 78, which is the worst score he’s ever made in the 24 years he’s been playing here, and done it on a day that seemed tailor-made for going low. The round left him 13 over par for the tournament, and 22 shots off Scottie Scheffler’s lead, in 47th place. And despite it all, he was grinning like he’d just won the tournament. He clearly wasn’t exaggerating when he said he wasn’t sure whether his injuries would ever allow him to play competitive golf again. “It was an unbelievable feeling,” Woods said when he was back in Butler Cabin. “I wasn’t exactly playing my best out there, but just to have the support out there and the appreciation from all the fans, I don’t think words can really describe it, given where I was a little over a year ago, and what my prospects were at that time. To end up here, and to be able to play in all four rounds, even a month ago I didn’t know if I could pull this off. “ Woods described his comeback as one of the greatest achievements of his career. “Without a doubt.” Woods’s perspective on the game is understandably different these days. His priorities seem to have been reshaped by his near-death experience in that car crash outside Los Angeles, by his first hours in the hospital afterwards, when there was a genuine possibility that they were going to have to amputate his right leg, and by the countless hours of gruelling rehabilitation he has done. “I’m just thankful, I keep saying it, but I am. I really am. I truly am. Just to get to this point. Just to be able to play,” he said. He wasn’t the only one, the game, the fans, even his fellow players, were glad to have him back too. Woods got a standing ovation when he reached each of the last nine tees, when he walked on to the 18th green, and when he walked off it again. The bridge on to the 12th belongs to Ben Hogan, and the bridge off the 13th to Byron Nelson, the crossing over the pond on the 15th is Gene Sarazen’s, but these last few days Woods has seemed to own every other part of this course. They should call it Tiger’s place. “This tournament has meant so much to me and my family, this entire tournament. You go back to the year I was born, that was the year that the first black man played in the Masters in Lee Elder. He was there when I won in ’97. And 25 years later here I am playing again.” Woods wasn’t in contention and he didn’t play especially well beyond the 71 he made on Thursday, but that didn’t really matter to the thousands of fans packed rows deep around every single inch of each tee-box, fairway and green he played. His crowd on Sunday was undoubtedly the largest gallery ever drawn by a man in 47th place. The game’s different when Tiger’s playing. TV ratings have been up more than 20% on last year’s Masters. The cameras love him so much that CBS showed the entirety of his walk from the 18th green to Butler cabin live, even though the tournament leaders, Scheffler and Cameron Smith, were playing the 1st green at the time. One day, when Woods finishes, this is going to be a problem for the sport because of the vacuum he will leave behind. The R&A will be delighted that it will not have to worry about filling it during the Open this summer, because he’s confirmed he’s going to play at St Andrews too. He said after his round here that the Old Course is about the only place in the sport that matters to him nearly as much as Augusta National does. “St Andrews is, obviously, near and dear to my heart because it’s the home of golf, and I’ve been able to win a couple of Opens there,” he said. He’s going to try to make the PGA Championship next month, as well. By then, Woods will have started to rebuild his game, he will be working on it day by day, in the same way he has been rebuilding his body. He didn’t have much touch with his putter this week, and will want to hone that in particular. “I don’t quite have the endurance that I would like to have had, but as of a few weeks ago, didn’t even know if I was going to play in this event. Now we’re excited about the prospects of the future, about training, about getting into that gym and doing some other stuff to get my leg stronger, which we haven’t been able to do because it needed more time to heal.” Woods added: “I think it needs a couple more days to heal after this, but we’ll get back after it, and we’ll get into it. I’ve got some work to do and I’m looking forward to doing it.” After everything he’s done in the last couple of years, you would be a fool to bet against him working his way back into the sort of form where he can win again.",Sport/Sport,Tiger Woods savours magical Masters comeback and sets sights on Open,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/10/tiger-woods-delighted-with-his-masters-despite-back-to-back-78s
4/11/2022,"Good morning. Scott Morrison has called the federal election for 21 May. The prime minister will be out campaigning in Gilmore, NSW, on Monday, while Anthony Albanese will be in the marginal Tasmanian seat of Bass. The two parties began their six-week election campaigns on Sunday. In their pitch to voters, Scott Morrison warned them not to risk a change to an “uncertain” future under the opposition, while the Labor leader says now is the time to seize the opportunity for better times ahead. The marginal seat of Gilmore, where roughly 80% of the electorate was devastated in the 2019-20 fires, is one of the few that the Liberals could win off Labor. But Morrison is proving divisive among locals. “Morrison? Oh, shit yeah. He is in big trouble,” Grant McLaurin says, happily calling him the “liar from the Shire” to rile up his drinking mates at the Heads Hotel. Meanwhile at the Coalition and Labor campaign headquarters, the parties’ election machines have been humming into gear for weeks. Here’s the who’s who of each operation. We also have a pork-o-meter to track all the barrelling action, a guide to every seat, and everything you need to know as a voter. Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said Russia is targeting “the whole European project”, declaring Russia’s aggression “was not intended to be limited to Ukraine alone”. Zelenskiy said it was the “moral duty of all democracies, all the forces of Europe, to support Ukraine’s desire for peace”. Vladimir Putin has appointed Alexander Dvornikov as the new general to direct the war in Ukraine as his military shifts plans after a failure to take Kyiv, according to officials. Boris Johnson has returned from a secret trip to Kyiv to meet with Zelenskiy, telling him the west would continue to “ratchet up” sanctions on Moscow as he praised the courage of the Ukrainian resistance. People with disabilities are increasingly being forgotten in disaster planning, according to advocates in an open letter demanding better resources and planning for disaster responses for people with disability. They say people with disability “continue to experience risks, neglect and serious negative impacts during disasters and emergencies”, resulting in “loss of services, supports and basic needs, as well as physical and psychological injuries”. An Iraqi man has been denied a compensation payment by the federal government after seeking an “act of grace” payment over an incident in which he alleges 35 family members were killed when an Australian airstrike targeting Islamic State instead obliterated a house where civilians were sheltering. A plan to extend irrigated agriculture in the Northern Territory’s tropical savannah could have disastrous effects on the region’s rivers and unforeseen impacts on the ecosystem, environmentalists argue. The Victorian government has called for at least 10 days of paid family violence leave to be offered to all workers. Victorian public sector workers are currently entitled to the leave, and while the uptake has been small, its benefits ‘far outweigh’ the cost to business, academics say. The centrist Emmanuel Macron will face the far-right Marine Le Pen in the final round of the French presidential election, after topping Sunday’s first round with 28% to her 23%, according to initial projected results. Imran Khan, who was ousted as Pakistan’s prime minister on Saturday, threatened to implement martial law rather than hand over power to the opposition, according to documents seen by the Guardian. A senior minister sent a message to an opposition leader that read: “Martial law or elections – your choice.” Elon Musk has set out his vision for Twitter in a series of posts on the social network described by one commentator as having “chaos energy”. We’re reaching the end of an era now that Neighbours is wrapping up, so we’re counting down the best songs by soap stars who took part in the time-honoured tradition of stepping into a recording studio and giving it a red-hot go. The price of everything from bread to milk is rising in Australia due to a “perfect storm” of conditions, including spiralling inflation fuelled by punishing petrol prices, higher feed and fertiliser costs, conflict between major food exporters Russia and Ukraine, and tight global supply. But some seasonal produce remains relatively affordable. We’ve listed the best value buys for autumn, with some tips on how to eat well while on a budget. “Thanks to a rereading of Jane Austen’s fiction I have experienced a rejuvenation of spirit and energy that has transformed my life,” writes Ruth Wilson. “When I read Pride and Prejudice at the age of 15, I read it as a domestic comedy – I loved the Bennet sisters because they were lively and, for all their bickering, they were having fun. The girls bore with their mother’s nerves and tolerated their father’s sarcasm without giving way to resentment. That helped me as an adolescent. At the age of 90 (almost!) I reread, ponder and console myself with Elizabeth Bennet’s words, ‘till this moment I never knew myself’. This is the moment I have been waiting for.” Why is it that, in some cases, one member of a household tests positive to Covid-19 while those living with them may develop symptoms yet return negative tests? In today’s Full Story, medical editor Melissa Davey talks to Jane Lee about why test results can be hit and miss and how the onset of cooler weather has people wondering: is it Covid, or a cold?

At some point watching the Matildas clash with New Zealand, all you could do was laugh, writes Joey Lynch, unless one is fortunate enough to be among that pure group of supporters whose mood is governed entirely by their team winning or losing. “Your best-laid plans are folly and there are no rules or logic to the football universe.” First Nations leaders are urging the future Australian government to hold a referendum on an Indigenous voice to parliament on 27 May next year or on 27 January 2024, reports the Australian. Former Dow Chemical chair Andrew Liveris has been named as the president of the Brisbane Olympics organising committee, promising a 2032 games that will “go down to the ground level of sustainability”, says the Brisbane Times. Federal parliament will be officially dissolved before the 21 May election, followed by a 19-gun salute.

4/11/2022,"Halifax, 1834. Four weeks after a secret wedding in a York church, where two women took communion and exchanged rings, witnessed by no one but their proud, brave, corseted selves. And 180 years before the first lawful same-sex marriages will take place in the UK. Just think of it. Actually, there’s no time, because here she is, the trailblazer herself, billowing coat-tails lustrous as a raven’s plumage, top hat silhouetted against the rolling hills of West Yorkshire. Striding – for Anne Lister, as all those who fail to keep up with her know, has no other walking mode – to tell her secret wife’s vile aunt what’s what. “Ah, there you are,” she says, turning to the camera and jabbing the air with her silver-topped cane. “Good.” Happy Sunday primetime period drama slot, folks! Gentleman Jack is back. For paramours of Sally Wainwright’s rollicking, romantic and exquisitely scripted historical drama, it’s been a long three-year wait. The first series was so brilliant it spawned the “Gentleman Jack effect”: a festival in Halifax, a statue (of a swaggering 19th-century Yorkshire lesbian!) and legions of global superfans. Not just of the show but of the garrulous diarist, industrialist and landowner herself, Anne Lister of Shibden Hall, who scribbled more than 5m words in her pioneering lifetime. All of which Wainwright seems to have gobbled up, infused with 21st-century irony and northern grit, and turned into one of the greatest British period dramas of our time. Much of this is down to Suranne Jones, whose Lister is an alchemical force of nature. Intense, uncompromising, reckless, charismatic, controlling, fragile and highly charged, Jones endlessly flirts with, but never tips over into, hamminess. It’s a genius performance, brimming with grand gestures and heart. So, too, are her direct addresses to the camera. It’s true that Jones’s Lister doesn’t so much break the fourth wall as make love to it, before buying it a silver wax seal and asking it to move in with her. But when she looks into the lens she is also collapsing time. Addressing us, the future inhabitants of a 21st century where she might be understood, valued, seen. If anything, she is even bolder this series. With her beloved Ann Walker stationed in York against the wishes of her small-minded, money-grubbing family, Lister has her work cut out. She has to convince all of Halifax that the solution to Ann’s fragile mental state is to move in with her. She has to convince Ann that they must combine estates, leading to perhaps the only sex scene in history in which the rewriting of wills is used as pillow talk. She has to convince the men sinking her coal pit that she has the capital, and her solicitor that she needs to borrow more money to realise her daring plans. Oh, and Lister has to convince herself that she is over Mariana, her ex, and that her love, or is that fondness, for Ann is enough. “We none of us feel the same way at 40 as we did at 14,” she confides to a friend. “With her I could be happy. I’ll make it work!” Edward Hall, Amanda Brotchie and Fergus O’Brien direct this series, bringing less of the galloping pace and northern specificity of Wainwright, who grew up a few miles from Shibden Hall. Instead, we get classic Andrew Davies-grade romance. In one lush scene, Ann is sketching the magisterial ruins of Rievaulx Abbey when Lister comes striding over the moor as the sun burns off the morning mist. It’s pure Darcy emerging wet-shirted from the lake stuff, but with a lesbian romantic heroine, jacket tossed over one shoulder and straw boater atop her tousled hair. How revolutionary. “Three very good kisses last night,” Lister says with a sigh as she heads down to her wife. “I am really satisfied with her.” This is a vexed moment in British period drama and history. The conversation continues about what constitutes good representation. About the ways in which greater diversity might be compounding amnesia and not challenging our long-upheld fantasies about some non-racist, benignly colonial British past in which no one was queer. Meanwhile, here’s Wainwright rolling up her sleeves and getting on with it. Behind the familiar frilly bonnets and linen drawers, the glorious landscapes and draughty old estates, Gentleman Jack is disrupting the conventions of one of our most fiercely loved dramatic forms, at a time when we most need them disrupted. It is a masterpiece. A gleeful, radical shake-up of period drama that repositions history, sexuality and class with the wink of an eye and poke of a cane. As a bisexual brown-skinned British woman who has been watching Sunday-night period dramas all my life, I cannot tell you how thrilling it is to see.",Arts/Television & radio,Gentleman Jack series two review – one of the greatest British period dramas of our time,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/10/gentleman-jack-series-two-review-one-of-the-greatest-british-period-dramas-of-our-time
4/11/2022,"Employment growth in the UK returned to pre-pandemic levels in March, but the jobs boom looks set to be short-lived amid rising living costs and the impact of the war in Ukraine, a report says. The business advisory firm BDO said UK companies reported the fastest growth in the labour market since February 2020. BDO said its index, which measures business sentiment among senior managers, rose for a fifth consecutive month to a reading of 112.74 last month – a two-point increase compared with February. Anything above 95 is considered to be growth. Managers in the manufacturing and services sectors were the keenest on hiring new staff, it said, as their optimism outweighed concerns across the economy about disrupted supply chains. Kaley Crossthwaite, a partner at BDO, said: “The labour market has shown resilience throughout the pandemic and then continued growth as restrictions have gradually lifted. While it’s reassuring to see employment return to near pre-pandemic levels, this strong form could come to an end as the cost of living crisis, rising inflation and wider geopolitical matters distract businesses from growth and place pressure on the employment index.” BDO’s findings back up recent data from the Office for National Statistics that showed a fall in the UK’s unemployment rate to 3.9% in the three months to January, dropping below pre-pandemic levels for the first time. The Resolution Foundation, an independent thinktank that monitors living standards, said wage growth had been driven up by a competitive labour market as firms increased pay to attract and retain workers. However, its economists fear wage growth will soon be offset by rising inflation and soaring energy prices, meaning workers will not feel the effects of a buoyant labour market. Nye Cominetti, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “With inflation set to reach 8% in the coming months, most workers’ earnings will fall in real terms, further squeezing living standards in the months ahead.” On Friday it emerged that in the US the number of people signing on for unemployment support had dropped to the lowest level since 1968, falling to 166,000 last week.",News/Business,UK firms report fastest growth in labour market since pre-pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/10/uk-firms-report-fastest-growth-in-labour-market-since-pre-pandemic
4/11/2022,"The Queen has revealed she was left “very tired and exhausted” after her recent bout of Covid-19 as she discussed her experience with a former patient whose brother and father died from the virus. The monarch tested positive for coronavirus in February, but carried on with her duties, despite suffering from what Buckingham Palace described as “mild cold-like symptoms”. During a virtual visit to the Royal London hospital in Whitechapel on Wednesday to mark the official opening of the Queen Elizabeth unit, she listened to the stories of medical staff, patients and workers who had used the facility during the pandemic. Speaking to Asef Hussain, a former Covid patient, and his wife, Shamina, the Queen said about the virus: “It does leave one very tired and exhausted, doesn’t it? This horrible pandemic. It’s not a nice result.” Hussain was the third member of his family to be admitted to hospital with coronavirus after they were infected in December 2020. His brother died first, closely followed by his father, who died while Hussain was on a ventilator. Recalling his experience, Hussain said his wife called an ambulance when he woke up one morning struggling to breathe. “I remember waking my wife saying that I feel like there’s no oxygen in the room,” he said. “I remember sticking my head out the window, just trying to breathe, trying to get that extra oxygen.” Hussain remained on a ventilator at the Royal London for seven weeks and is still recovering. Since his discharge, he has used a wheelchair and a portable oxygen machine. Elsewhere in the conversation, the Queen acknowledged the difficulty patients had not being able to see their families and friends while they were in hospital. “Of course, not being able to see your relatives was very hard,” she said. Mireia Lopez Rey Ferrer, a senior sister who has worked at the hospital since 2008, told the Queen about staff commitment to the patients. “As nurses, we made sure that they were not alone. We held their hands, we wiped their tears and we provided comfort,” she said. “It felt at times that we were running a marathon with no finish line.” The new 155-bed unit was built in just five weeks to meet the demand caused by the pandemic – normally, a facility of that size would take about five months to complete. Speaking to construction workers at the end of the call, the Queen said: “It is very interesting, isn’t it, when there is some very vital thing, how everybody works together and pulls together – marvellous, isn’t it?” When the team hailed the “Dunkirk spirit” that inspired them, the monarch replied: “Thank goodness it still exists.” The Queen, 95, has delegated a number of public appearances to other senior royals recently. On Friday, Buckingham Palace announced that Prince Charles and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, would represent the monarch at the annual Royal Maundy church service. Prince Charles also stood in for the Queen at the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey last month. The Queen is understood to be in good health, but has some mobility issues. On Saturday, she commemorated the anniversary of the death of husband, Prince Philip, privately at her home in Windsor.",News/UK news,"Covid left me ‘exhausted’, Queen tells bereaved couple",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/10/covid-left-me-exhausted-queen-tells-bereaved-couple

4/11/2022,"An intimate revival of the musical Cabaret, which transformed London’s Playhouse theatre into the debauched Kit Kat Club of Weimar Berlin, has triumphed at this year’s Olivier awards. The production won in seven categories at the ceremony, which was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London on Sunday for the first time in three years and hosted by comedian Jason Manford. Covid forced the cancellation of the last two annual awards shows, though a prerecorded virtual ceremony served as a stopgap in autumn 2020. Cabaret took all four awards for actors in a musical: Eddie Redmayne (as the Kit Kat’s grotesque ringleader, the Emcee) and Jessie Buckley (as singer Sally Bowles) in their leading roles, and Elliot Levey and Liza Sadovy as supporting characters whose romance is imperilled by the rise of nazism. Rebecca Frecknall was named best director, and Cabaret also took the awards for best musical revival and best sound design (for Nick Lidster). Redmayne, who previously played the Emcee in an Edinburgh fringe production of John Kander and Fred Ebb’s musical in 2001, returned to the West End for the first time in 10 years to reprise the role. It brings him his second Olivier award: he won in 2010 for playing the assistant to painter Mark Rothko in the play Red. Redmayne paid tribute to Buckley, saying he would “never have gone on this ride” without her. When Buckley took the stage to collect her award she joked that it was “like my worst nightmare and my biggest dream all at once” The winners of the Olivier awards, overseen by the Society of London Theatre, are chosen by a team of industry figures, stage luminaries and theatre-loving members of the public. The Oliviers honour London productions, but this year’s second biggest winner, Life of Pi, is a success story that began in Sheffield. Lolita Chakrabarti’s puppet-powered adaptation of Yann Martel’s much-loved novel opened at the city’s Crucible theatre in 2019 and its West End transfer was, like many productions, severely delayed by the pandemic. Life of Pi won five awards including best new play, best lighting design (Tim Lutkin and Andrzej Goulding) and best set design (Tim Hatley for the design and Nick Barnes and Finn Caldwell for the puppets). Hiran Abeysekera was named best actor for his portrayal of the shipwrecked teenager Pi, and the best supporting actor prize was shared by seven actors who play the tiger in the show: one gives the creature a voice, and three pairs of performers each represent its head, heart and hind. Manford presided over a joyous ceremony with plenty of gags. Referring to the slap that Will Smith gave presenter Chris Rock at the Oscars, after a joke about Smith’s wife Jada Pinkett Smith, Manford said: “I will very much be keeping your wives’ names out of my chuffing mouth … this is an evening for back-slapping not face-slapping!” Later he joked about Andrew Lloyd Webber’s declaration that he would risk arrest to open his theatre during the shutdown, calling the composer “the Che Guevara of the West End”. Many speeches were marked by the sense of joy in a community coming together again after the prolonged instability and disruption caused by Covid. The actor Lesley Manville also introduced a special performance in solidarity with the people of Ukraine during what she called a time of “unbearable suffering” after the Russian invasion. The Ukrainian mezzo soprano Kseniia Nikolaieva, whose family are still in her home land, performed the country’s national anthem. In his speech, Elliot Levey paid tribute to his late Ukrainian grandfather, who fled Kyiv many years ago after his brothers were killed in a pogrom, and Levey criticised the “incompetence and hostility” of the UK’s current scheme for hosting Ukrainians. The prize for best entertainment or comedy play was taken by Pride and Prejudice* (*Sort Of), a rambunctious, all-female riff on Jane Austen’s novel first staged at Glasgow’s tiny Tron theatre in 2018. Despite rave reviews, its West End run was cut short in February after Covid restrictions led to plummeting audience numbers and losses estimated at up to £25,000 a week. Back to the Future: The Musical, whose 2020 run in Manchester ended early due to Covid before it transferred to London’s Adelphi theatre, was named best new musical. The award for best revival of a play went to a canny production of Nick Payne’s two-hander Constellations, in which four pairs of actors took turns to play a couple whose relationship is set against the backdrop of quantum multiverse theory. Directed by Michael Longhurst, the Donmar Warehouse production was presented at the Vaudeville theatre while the Donmar underwent renovation works. For her performance in Constellations, Sheila Atim won best actress. It is her second Olivier award; she also took best actress in a supporting role in a musical for Girl from the North Country in 2018. Atim said the play was about “fighting adversity together” and that “we all did that” during the pandemic. She thanked her co-star Ivanno Jeremiah and also savoured the fact that, in the Donmar’s diverse approach to casting for Constellations, her role was subsequently played by a man, Omari Douglas, when he appeared opposite Russell Tovey later on in the run. The National Theatre’s production of Larry Kramer’s autobiographical play The Normal Heart, about the 1980s Aids crisis in New York, had nominations for best revival and four of its actors. Liz Carr won for her performance as a character based on Dr Linda Laubenstein, a physician and pioneering HIV/Aids researcher. Carr thanked the National Theatre for giving a disabled actor the chance to play the role while stressing that “it shouldn’t be a chance, it should be a right”. She wore a dress decorated with some of her character’s lines from the play and said that The Normal Heart combined her twin interests in art and activism and that its story resonated amid a global health crisis and the response of an “apathetic” government. The award for outstanding achievement in an affiliate theatre went to the Bush theatre’s Old Bridge, a play by Igor Memic set around his home town of Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In a bumper year for escapist musical spectaculars, a lavish production of Cole Porter’s Anything Goes – which broke box-office records at the Barbican – won one award, for best theatre choreographer, from a total of nine nominations. Anything Goes received a five-star review from the Guardian, as did the blockbuster Disney musical Frozen, which reopened at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane after a £60m renovation. Frozen had four nominations but none resulted in a win. Moulin Rouge! The Musical won for its sumptuous costumes designed by Catherine Zuber. Get Up, Stand Up! The Bob Marley Musical had four nominations, with orchestrator Simon Hale winning in his category. The ceremony was punctuated with performances from nominated musicals and ended with a tribute to the late Stephen Sondheim. The Royal Opera House was recognised for Peter Whelan and the Irish Baroque Orchestra’s Bajazet (outstanding achievement in opera) and for Jenůfa, directed by Claus Guth (best new opera production), as well as for best family show for Wolf Witch Giant Fairy, a folk opera created with the company Little Bulb in the ROH’s Linbury theatre. Both dance awards went to productions at Sadler’s Wells: Revisor, Crystal Pite and Jonathon Young’s show based on Nikolai Gogol’s play The Government Inspector, was named best new dance production, while Jolly Folly, an ode to silent movies choreographed by rising star Arielle Smith for English National Ballet, won outstanding achievement in dance. Special recognition awards were given to five individuals this year to recognise their outstanding contributions to the theatre industry. They went to Lisa Burger, executive director and joint chief executive of the National Theatre (who was also recently made a CBE); the designer Bob King, who has created artwork and advertising campaigns for many major West End shows; Gloria Louis, the inclusion and diversity lead for Delfont Mackintosh Theatres; philanthropist Susie Sainsbury; and Sylvia Young, who founded her drama school 50 years ago. Its alumni include singers Amy Winehouse and Dua Lipa, actors Daniel Kaluuya and Keeley Hawes, and past Olivier winner Billie Piper.
