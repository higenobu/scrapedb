2/24/2022,"Early into the premiere episode of Race, the six-part Netflix docuseries on Bubba Wallace, the thesis statement comes roaring in as loud as a stock car at wide-open throttle. “I think a lot of the world needs to understand that this is probably the most pressured athlete in all of sports history,” muses Ryan Hall, Wallace’s baby-faced manager. And while no one would deny the unique stresses that Wallace has endured as the only Black driver in Nascar’s top racing division … pump your brakes.  At last check Warner Bros just dropped a feature film about two Black girls from Compton who somehow went on to dominate the lily-white world of tennis. And then there’s also that Black kid from Stevenage who broke into Formula One on the way to becoming arguably the greatest driver in the sport’s history. The Old World racism that the Williams sisters and Lewis Hamilton overcame on their way to the top is every bit as virulent as the Southern fried variety that Wallace, 28, has to reckon with — and the Williams and Hamilton haven’t entirely risen above it either. This self-important streak is a major headwind for Race, which would’ve been better served by letting the whirlwind driver’s life speak for itself. That was the hook for Behind the Wall, the eight-part docuseries that helped launch Facebook Watch in 2018. And it introduced the world to a happy-go-lucky sort who didn’t shrink from his burden of being the fourth Black driver to ever compete at Nascar’s highest-echelon Cup series, but also didn’t let that burden get in the way of palling around with peer drivers and crew members, flogging his basement drum kit for fun, or annoying his fiancee, Amanda, with his bouts of uncontrolled flatulence. The let-the-subject-breathe approach just doesn’t work for Behind the Wall, which captures Wallace in his maiden Cup season when the driver colloquially known as Nascar’s Charley Pride had hoped to be considered one of the good ol’ boys. But the show-don’t-tell formula ends up becoming the secret sauce in Drive to Survive - Formula One’s hit Netflix reality series. It lets F1’s personalities, politics and rivalries do the hard job of shrinking a sprawling, technophilic sport down to savoury morsels. Race was supposed to be Nascar’s Drive to Survive rebuttal, their bid to pull racing agnostics into the sport. But unlike the earlier series, which limited expert testimony to a small batch of insiders, Race does something far different. Rather than restrict the wide-angle perspectives to authorities like Nascar D&I head Brandon Thompson and the all-knowing beat reporter Bob Pockrass,the urgency to grab casual viewers has director Erik Parker going to W Kamau Bell, Jemele Hill and other Nascar dilettantes to reinforce why this here project is so essential and well worth your time. Here’s the thing, though: unlike Formula One, still a largely unknown quantity on these shores, the curious odyssey of Nascar’s Bubba Wallace has been headline news for the better part of a decade. Race picks it up at its controversial peak in 2020 and finds the driver world-weary and struggling with depression. In the doc Wallace calls 2020 the craziest year of his life, and June was easily the maddest month. Race reveals how a sport idled by the pandemic sent Wallace hurtling on to a crash course with the boiling social justice movement, and how the viral video of Ahmaud Arbery’s shooting death kicked up memories of a similar incident in his family 15 years earlier. (Brace yourself: the first episode almost gleefully replays the Arbery video over. And over. And over …) Dead-set on making a statement, despite his car owner going on record with his disdain for national anthem protesters, Wallace turned up to Nascar’s 7 June restart in Atlanta in a black T-shirt bearing George Floyd’s last words: “I Can’t Breathe.” A day later he pushed Nascar to ban displays of the confederate flag, an ugly vestige of the sport’s southeastern roots. For the following week’s race at Martinsville, Va., his car was turned into a Black Lives Matter billboard. Two weeks after that, he was greeted at a race in Talladega by a parade of rebel flag bearers and with what looked like a noose hanging from his garage door stall. And when the FBI closed its investigation without calling the noose incident a hate crime, seemingly every red-hat right winger from President Trump on down called out Wallace for crying wolf - even though it was a crew member who called in the sighting. But the truly astonishing bit comes when Wallace, in the Race premiere, talks about how he knew he was risking it all by placing the Amazon order for that “I Can’t Breathe” shirt and how he was prepared to suffer the consequences. “I put everything else aside and was selfish for a change,” he tells me. The irony of course is that by standing 10-toes down in his Blackness, Wallace wasn’t just embraced by Nascar’s inner circle and the larger Black American community; he became an endorsement magnet on the way to helming an expansion racing team co-owned by Michael Jordan that just opened the 2022 season with a second-place finish at Sunday’s Daytona 500. Worse than lacking Drive to Survive’s luxury marques, glamorous locales and space-age technology, Race suffocates its subject in context, overstating the significance of a driver who doesn’t need much setup. Wallace’s isn’t the untold story of some far away historical figure but, rather, the unfinished journey of a driver on the cusp unfolding under the scrutinising eyes of social media and the international press. That’s a plenty compelling hook on its own. Race didn’t need the extra fuming to justify itself.",Arts/Television & radio,Netflix’s Bubba Wallace docuseries ends up losing the race,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/23/netflix-bubba-wallace-docuseries
2/24/2022,"It will go down as one of the most surreal sessions the United Nations chamber has ever witnessed, as the very war it was supposed to prevent broke out while it was sitting. Vladimir Putin, with brutal timing, delivered a speech announcing that Russia would start a “special military operation” in Ukraine – while an emergency session of the UN security council was under way.  The secretary general, Antonio Guterres, was the first to speak, and at that time Putin’s intentions were not entirely clear. But Guterres pointed to the reports of troops moving into position, and did something notable and rare for a UN secretary general: he publicly called out the head of a security council permanent member. “If indeed an operation is being prepared, I have only one thing to say, from the bottom of my heart,” Guterres said. “President Putin: stop your troops from attacking Ukraine. Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died.” By the time it was the turn of the Russian representative, Vasily Nebenzya, to speak, Putin had given his address, and there was no more mystery. Peace was not to be given a chance after all. Nebenzya, who had spent weeks deriding western states for their “hysterical” warnings of impending invasion, pivoted to argue it was not actually a war that was getting under way, but a “special military operation” to protect the people of the Donbass. The Ukrainian ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, had been waiting for his turn to speak while receiving constant updates from Kyiv. When his time came, he had to dispense with his prepared speech because, he said, “most of it is already useless”. Instead he held up a copy of the UN charter and read the clause that said UN membership was open to all peace-loving states that accepted the obligations contained in the small sky-blue booklet. “Russia is not able to carry out any of those obligations,” Kyslytsya declared. He challenged Nebenzya to deny that Ukraine was under attack. “You have a smartphone,” he said, taunting the Russian to check with his boss, the foreign minister, on what was really going on. “You can call Lavrov right now. We can make a pause to let you go out and call him.” Nebenzya declined. “I have already said all I know at this point,” he said. “Waking up minister Lavrov at this time is not something I plan to do.” An hour or so into the meeting, the multiplying reports of bombardment of Ukrainian cities had reached the chamber, and if the futility of the council’s calls for peace and dialogue had not been clear before, they were now agonisingly obvious. Some ambassadors demanded to speak for a second time to express their sense of betrayal. “At the exact time as we were gathered in the council seeking peace, Putin delivered a message of war in total disdain for the responsibility of this council,” said the US permanent representative, Linda Thomas-Greenfield. “This is a grave emergency.” Her British counterpart, Barbara Woodward, declared it “a grave day for Ukraine and for the principles of the United Nations”. Kyslytsya himself was trembling with emotion. He stared at Nebenzya and demanded the Russian relinquish his duties as chair of the council. “There is no purgatory for war criminals,” he warned him. “They go straight to hell.” At that point, Nebenzya quickly closed the meeting, claiming that Russia’s aggression was not directed at the Ukrainian people, but against what he called “the junta that is in power in Kiev”. Then he adjourned and left. A security council that had begun, just about, in peacetime, had broken up in a time of war, and perhaps at the start of a major conflict.",News/World news,"Moment that Putin thundered to war, drowning out last entreaties for peace",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/moment-that-putin-thundered-to-war-drowning-out-last-entreaties-for-peace
2/24/2022,"Heather Morgan is free, for now. The 31-year-old fraudster was offered bail on Valentine’s Day, releasing her from incarceration while her husband, Ilya “Dutch” Liechtenstein, remains in federal bondage. Morgan is at the centre of a psychedelic cryptocurrency saga, that began when the pair were arrested on suspicion of laundering $4.5bn worth of stolen bitcoin. That money was originally pilfered from a Hong Kong-based crypto exchange firm called Bitfinex, and it breaks the record for the most digital currency that’s ever been seized by a criminal sting operation. (The pair allegedly spent the money on NFTs, gold and a Walmart gift card.) It’s the first major crime saga of the Web3 era – Blockchain noir, ripe for a Safdie Brothers film – and each twist in the storyline is more implausible than the last.  But who is this Bitcoin crime queen and what does she tell us about the future of organized crime and the stark new inequalities that it might create? The money that Morgan and Lichtenstein are accused of laundering was originally pilfered six years ago, and honestly it’s a minor miracle that the Department of Justice was capable of digging it up in the first place as crypto is notoriously difficult to recover. So far they have seized $3.6bn. So if you are already the sort of person who might be seduced by the grifter’s lifestyle, cryptocurrency is a natural hideout point. Everything about this case is more evidence of the worryingly psychotropic texture our monetary system has taken on in 2022 – a year when late-night hosts are dropping thousands of dollars on cartoon apes and YouTube prankster Logan Paul is making $20m per boxing match. It is hard to articulate how it feels to be alive in an age of massive wealth disparity and multiple deregulatory lines of questionable crypto minting, but I think watching an alleged Bitcoin embezzler struggle through painful rap bars in a flat-billed cap that reads “0 FCKS” is a good summation of the overwhelming confusion. Let’s begin with the many layers of Heather Morgan’s business portfolio. It turns out that when The Crime Queen of Bitcoin is not conducting her digital heists, she’s also an ascendent TikTokker, a self-help YouTuber, an economic columnist and most impressively, an amateur rapper. The alias she uses for her artistic ventures: “Razzlekhan.” After her arrests, the world was briefly subsumed by Razzlekhan’s mesmerizing public brand as reporters around the world splunked through the tranches of content left behind in Morgan’s wake. In one memorable music video, she gallivants through Wall Street in John Lennon sunglasses and a leopard-print scarf, ready for a fight. “I’ve got pallid blood, I’m a real risk-taker,” she rhymes in the shadow of a bronze George Washington statue. There’s also a 14-minute YouTube soliloquy where Razzlekhan doles out higher-education advice. “I’m not trust fund,” she says. “My parents both work for the government. I’ve been totally broke and homeless. Money, in my mind, comes goes. Sometimes you have it and sometimes you don’t.” She makes no reference as to the exact nature in which she found herself with money. Morgan was upfront about her financial avarice in a column she wrote for Inc. in 2021 entitled: 4 First-Time Founder Mistakes to Avoid at All Costs, Morgan asks readers to remember that your desire to hustle should never run dry. “The first million dollars in revenue is so exciting,” she wrote. “But once you hit that, you’re thinking about how to get to $5m, $10m, and suddenly $100m.” At one point she asks her viewers to consider a goal, and find the “easiest path” to achieve it. Pinned to the top of her Twitter page is a quote that is erroneously attributed to Winston Churchill: “You have enemies? Good. That means you’ve stood up for something in your life.” It is unsurprising that Morgan surfaced within the burgeoning blockchain underground.She embodies a ubiquitous type in the world of crypto – the chronically posting hustle-entrepreneur who has consolidated every available publicity stunt and duplicitous business undertaking within reach to brute-force a hollow, demi-influencer’s subsistence. To think that those music videos might’ve been funded by freshly laundered crypto credit is ghoulishly predictable. The couple is “a perfect synecdoche for everything anyone doesn’t like about an attention economy in which anything can be financialized”, argues Vice in their investigation into her rap career. Unsurprisingly, this week also brought news that Netflix was already hard at work on a docuseries about the couple. Who knows? Maybe Razzlekhan is destined to become the next Tiger King. Heather Morgan and Dutch Liechtenstein have not pleaded guilty. Their defense attorney has taken an adversarial stance in the proceedings thus far, claiming that the government’s case is “thin.” So perhaps normalcy will return, justice will be served and the world can breathe easy knowing that a mediocre rapper and her husband are not capable of participating in the largest crypto heist in human history. But for now we do not have that privilege and I think that’s why everyone keeps tumbling down the Razzlekhan rabbit hole. The lasting legacy of Morgan and Lichtenstein may be that they’ve killed the image we hold of a criminal kingpin in our heads. It’s been a long time since the mob ran New York City, in part because traditional organized crime, with its body counts, turf wars and punitive sentencing measures, is far too risky for the expected gains. In their stead, we have received a generation of crypto eccentrics who have moved operations to the arctic regions of the American economy. The blockchain was always going to attract the most unbridled dreamers of the population, and now we are watching one of them morph into a supervillain dressed in leather pants and a flight jacket, calling themselves the Turkish Martha Stewart in some of the worst hip-hop ever recorded. As we get deeper into our uncertain metaversal future I expect that the rise and fall of figures like Morgan will become increasingly common.

2/24/2022,"The prospects for an expansion of oil and gas drilling in the North Sea have cleared a major hurdle, as the Committee on Climate Change said “stringent tests” must be applied to any new exploration licences but stopped short of saying they could not be issued. New drilling would not reduce energy bills for UK consumers, the committee found, and its chair, former Conservative environment secretary Lord Deben, said he would “favour” a moratorium on North Sea exploration.  He said refusing new licences would “send a clear signal to investors and consumers that the UK is committed” to its climate goals, and help to “strengthen climate ambition internationally”. But the committee, which is the statutory adviser to the government on the net zero goal, concluded that as it could not establish clearly whether new exploration would significantly increase greenhouse gas emissions globally, and as considering the UK’s energy security went beyond its remit, any decision on new licences must be taken by ministers. “Weighing these advantages is an inherently political decision, which goes beyond climate policy and sits rightly with government, not with my committee,” wrote Deben, in a letter to business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng published on Thursday. He also made clear that producing more North Sea oil and gas would do little or nothing to help UK consumers cope with high energy prices. “Any increases in UK extraction of oil and gas would have, at most, a marginal effect on the prices faced by UK consumers in future,” he wrote. Despite these warnings, the committee’s conclusion is likely to boost controversial government plans to license new oil and gasfields in the North Sea. Green campaigners said any exploration for new oilfields, to rejuvenate the North Sea’s declining production, would have disastrous impacts on the climate. Tessa Khan, director of Uplift, which campaigns for an end to fossil fuel extraction, said: “The committee’s opposition to continued North Sea exploration is a clear acknowledgment that there is a limit to what we can safely burn. There’s no justification for these developments, which will see the oil in them exported. They won’t lower bills or contribute to UK energy security. All they’ll do is increase industry profits.” The UK hosted the Cop26 UN climate summit last November, and will continue to direct international climate efforts this year as president of the UN negotiations. Deben made it clear that allowing new oil and gas extraction would have a “material” impact on the UK’s ability to encourage other countries to improve their climate targets. “Continuing to allow extraction may weaken UK diplomacy to encourage other countries to adapt ambitious climate policies. It is also important on a domestic state for their to be a perception that government policy is fully aligned with net zero, rather than being undermined by questions such as seen over the last year with the proposed coal mine in Cumbria and the Cambo oilfield,” he wrote. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, warned of the impact on the UK’s attempts to bolster the achievements of Cop26. “New North Sea oil and gas developments send out totally the wrong signals both to UK businesses and consumers and the wider world,” she said. “The UK Cop president, Alok Sharma, is being cut off at the knees in his diplomatic efforts to keep [the global heating limit of] 1.5C alive – the key objective of the Glasgow climate pact. These licences don’t make climate sense, they don’t make diplomatic sense and they don’t make financial sense, and no amount of so-called climate compatibility tests will change that.” However, the committee’s advice that climate tests should be applied to licences that have already been issued, such as that to the Cambo oilfield, was welcomed. Danny Gross, campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “It’s reassuring that the government’s plan to apply climate tests only to new licensing rounds is totally wrong in the committee’s view. This loophole would allow dozens of carbon-intensive projects that have already been licensed, but not yet approved, to escape these tests.” The government is consulting on a “climate checkpoint” that would require any new oil and gas licences to pass a series of tests on their environmental impact. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, is expected to review at least six applications for new drilling licences in the North Sea this year, after a similar number were approved last year. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “There will continue to be ongoing demand for oil and gas over the coming decades as we transition to cleaner and cheaper forms of energy generated in this country. Turning off North Sea gas overnight would put energy security, British jobs and industries at risk and we would be more dependent on foreign imports. We welcome the committee’s acknowledgment that carbon budgets can still be met if new oil and gas fields are developed in the UK.” The committee also emphasised the role of insulation and renewable energy in cutting energy bills. Scrapped housebuilding regulations would have knocked about £40 off energy bills, and if the 2030 target for offshore wind had been brought forward sooner, consumers would be £100 a year better off. Rosie Rogers, head of oil and gas transition for Greenpeace UK, said: “Anyone who’s read this advice and thinks the North Sea’s future lies in oil and gas is utterly deluded, because it will take decades and won’t ease energy bills. What we need to tackle bills and climate change is home insulation, heat pumps, electric vehicles and renewable power.” She added: “The future of the North Sea is in renewables. Our economy, our energy security and our climate depends on it.”",News/Environment,"North Sea oil exploration should not proceed but can, says UK’s climate committee",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/24/north-sea-oil-exploration-should-not-proceed-but-can-says-uks-climate-committee
2/24/2022,"We recently sold our semi-detached house and moved to a second-floor flat in a seven-storey block. We had both contents and buildings insurance for the house with Axa. As we no longer need buildings cover we tried to move our contents cover with us, but were told Axa wouldn’t insure properties with a flat roof. That response has been almost universal. The cover we eventually found is more expensive than the combined contents and buildings insurance previously.  Some neighbours in our block don’t have contents cover. This must be a common problem. How do people negotiate it? TS, Eastbourne, East Sussex Given how many apartment blocks have flat roofs, this is a startling experience. Insurers are generally wary of houses with roofs with a pitch of less than 10% because of the increased risk of storm damage and intruder access, and if more than a quarter of the roof area is flat, you’re looking at specialist, pricier policies. But you are not in a house. I assumed that Axa would relent when I pointed out there are five storeys between you and the problematic roof, but no. “Axa UK, along with many other insurers, does not provide home insurance when more than 50% of a property’s roof is flat,” it says. “This is because there is a higher risk of weather damage to the building and contents.” You say you searched out quotes on price comparison sites. These tend to use a standard template for applications which may not differentiate between a flat and a house when it comes to the roof type. This means you’re likely to be refused cover, or charged significantly more. Brokers are better placed to help find appropriate policies. I contacted the UK’s largest, Swinton, and was assured that it’s straightforward to insure contents in flat-roofed blocks. The company has since found you cover at half the cost of your previous quote. I hope you can help recognise outstanding customer service. I bought a pair of walking boots from Cotswold Outdoor in July 2019. Recently, they started leaking between the sole and the leather uppers.

I asked her what the job was like. She said she had not been doing it long and it wasn’t too bad apart from all the lifting, with which she was struggling. I’ve always thought the job must be a lot easier outside towns and cities, where parking tends to be tricky. “That’s true,” she said. “But the biggest problem I have, whatever route I’m on, is finding somewhere to go to the toilet. By the time I’ve found a toilet to use, I’ve got behind on my drops and I get into trouble.”  Trying to be helpful, I asked if she had thought about using a Shewee, which I had heard come in useful for some women at festivals and whatnot. She seemed quite interested and asked me exactly how they worked. I explained that the operational details of such devices were obviously outside my lived experience. She laughed and went on her way. I rarely get supermarket deliveries, but, like most of us, have taken items from countless delivery people.

2/24/2022,"Gun safety advocates have condemned Tennessee legislation which would designate some gun owners as police, allowing civilians to carry firearms in locations usually reserved for law enforcement. The proposed law, introduced in the Tennessee house and senate this month, “expands the definition of ‘law enforcement officer’” to include civilians who hold an enhanced handgun-carry permit – earned by taking an eight-hour handgun safety course and paying a $100 fee.  It comes as a separate bill which would allow 18-year-olds to apply for concealed-carry licenses was approved by a Tennessee house subcommittee on Tuesday. Shannon Watts, founder of the gun safety group Moms Demand Action, told the Guardian: “Encouraging people to arm themselves and play police puts everyone at risk while making the jobs of actual law enforcement much more difficult. “The process of obtaining a handgun permit doesn’t come anywhere close to the extensive training that real officers go through, and it’s ridiculous to equate the two. Extremist and dangerous bills like these are part of the gun lobby’s blatant attempt to codify and legalize armed vigilantism.” She added: “Tennessee has the 14th highest rate of gun violence in the country, and lawmakers should be focused on passing policies that will actually make communities safer, not reckless bills like these.” The proposed bill was introduced in the state senate by Joey Hensley, a Republican, who told ABC News that the aim of the bill was to allow people with an enhanced handgun carry permit to carry their guns into locations where off-duty law enforcement are allowed to enter, including a store or restaurant that prohibits firearms. “This is trying to open it up so that people who go to the extreme to get this extra permit can have the right to defend themselves in more places,” Hensley said. Hensley’s plan has not just alarmed those who advocate for better gun safety. The Tennessee State Lodge for the Fraternal Order of Police, the state’s largest police union, said that it is “adamantly opposed to this bill in its current form.” Scottie DeLashmit, the president of Tennessee State Lodge for the Fraternal Order of Police, told ABC that officers “spend countless hours” honing their skills, and must qualify annually with the same weapons. DeLashmit added that officers also spend hours training in “driving, criminal law, defensive tactics, etc.” “These vigorous standards are in place to ensure officers are familiar with their weapons,” DeLashmit said in the statement. “The enhanced handgun carry permit training is far less demanding than anything required from a cadet attending a basic law enforcement academy.” The bill was introduced in the Tennessee House by Chris Hurt, who did not respond to a request for comment. Hensley, who was a member of the House for ten years before he was elected to the state senate in 2013, has a history of supporting extreme legislation, including anti-LGBTQ laws.

2/24/2022,"China’s new ambassador to Australia has offered an olive branch in the intense diplomatic dispute between the two countries, saying they should “meet each other halfway” and “look into the future”. Xiao Qian, who arrived in Canberra in January after years of increasing tensions, said China attached “great importance” to the relationship and was willing to “actively develop friendship and cooperation with Australia”.  The intervention comes just days after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, accused China of a dangerous “act of intimidation” over a Chinese warship’s shining of a laser at a RAAF surveillance plane north of Australia last week. China’s national defence ministry, in turn, accused the Australian defence force of “spiteful and provocative actions”. Xiao said in a speech on Thursday that the healthy and stable development of China-Australia relations served the fundamental interests and “common aspirations” of people in both countries. Given this year marked the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties, he said, there was an opportunity to ease tensions. “China is willing to work with Australia to meet each other halfway,” said Xiao, who previously was China’s ambassador to Indonesia. He said the two governments should “jointly make efforts” to push the relationship back on “the right track”. They should “review the past” and also “look into the future”. Xiao did not specify any tangible actions Beijing may take to get the relationship back on track – but clearly signalled he wants to talk. Later, he told SBS World News and the ABC: “The diplomatic channel is open.” Australian ministers have complained since early 2020 they have been unable to secure phone calls or meetings with their direct counterparts – although contacts have continued to occur at lower diplomatic levels. The Australian government accuses Beijing of engaging in “economic coercion” by hitting a range of Australian export sectors with tariffs, bans or other sanctions in 2020 – some of which are being challenged at the World Trade Organization. Both major political parties in Australia view the differences in the relationship with China as largely structural and therefore not something that can be fixed by adopting a different tone. China is particularly sensitive to criticism about human rights and the crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong and Australia’s longstanding position against using force or the threat of force to bring Taiwan under Beijing’s control. In recent months, Beijing has ramped up its criticism of new or renewed groupings such as the Quad and Aukus. Still, Xiao’s comments signalled a more open approach to dialogue, and contrast with a warning from his predecessor Cheng Jingye in April last year that Beijing would respond “in kind” if Australia followed other countries in imposing sanctions against its officials over human rights abuses in Xinjiang. On Wednesday, the former Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop added her voice to calls for Australia’s foreign policy and national security to “always be, as far as possible, bipartisan”. Bishop’s comments to the ABC’s 7.30 program follow growing attempts by the Morrison government to argue a point of difference with Labor over China in the lead-up to the May election. Politicisation of national security also triggered carefully worded pushback from the Asio chief, Mike Burgess. Xiao was speaking at an event at the Chinese embassy in Canberra to present the family of the late New South Wales police force officer Kelly Foster with a medal honouring her bravery. Foster died trying to save Chinese student Jennifer Qi in a whirlpool in the Blue Mountains in January last year. Qi also lost her life. Xiao told the audience – which included senior Australian federal police and NSW police force representatives – that Foster had displayed “the warmth of great love and humanity that transcend race, culture and nationality”. “China and Australia are far away from each other geographically, by thousands of miles, yet great love knows no national boundaries nor distance,” the ambassador said. He said Foster’s “heroic act” had been widely reported in China, where millions of people “could feel the warmth, kindness and friendship of the Australian people”. The NSW police commissioner, Karen Webb, said the force felt the loss deeply. “It is a testament to her courage that she went immediately to Jennifer’s aid without a second’s thought for her own safety,” Webb said. Foster was posthumously awarded the Great Wall Commemorative Medal of China’s Ministry of Public Security.
