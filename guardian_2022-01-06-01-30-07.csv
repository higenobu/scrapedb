1/6/2022,"The former peer Nazir Ahmed has been found guilty of serious sexual assault against a young boy and the attempted rape of a girl when he was a teenager in the 1970s. Ahmed, 64, was found guilty on Wednesday of buggery against a boy in Rotherham, and twice attempting to rape a girl. Buggery was the legal term for the specific sexual assault at the time of the offences.  The former Lord Ahmed of Rotherham was charged alongside his two older brothers, Mohammed Farouq, 71, and Mohammed Tariq, 65, but both were deemed unfit to stand trial. A woman told a jury at Sheffield crown court that Ahmed attempted to rape her in 1973 and 1974, when the defendant was about 16 or 17 years old, but she was much younger. The former politician was also found guilty of a serious sexual assault against a boy under 11 in 1972. The jury was played a recording of a telephone call between the two complainants, made by the woman after she went to the police in 2016. Tom Little QC, prosecuting, told the jury that the call was prompted by the man contacting the woman by email saying: “I have evidence against that paedophile.” Ahmed claimed the allegations were a “malicious fiction” but the prosecution said the call showed they were not “made up or concocted”. In the recording, the woman said to the man: “What they did to you was utterly wrong and it’s time now to seek justice for the little boy who could not protect himself.” Ahmed, who denied all the charges, was found guilty on Wednesday of two counts of attempted rape and one of buggery. Appointed a life peer by Tony Blair, Ahmed resigned from the Labour party in 2013.His brothers Farouq and Tariq faced charges of indecent assault in relation to the same boy that Ahmed abused and, also on Wednesday, the jury found that they had carried out the acts alleged. The judge, Mr Justice Lavender, will determine on Wednesday afternoon when Ahmed will be sentenced. Rosemary Ainslie, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said the verdicts clearly showed “that no matter the delay between the offences and the trial, and the defences raised, they could be sure that the accounts of the victims were credible and true”. “One of these defendants held a position of power, influence and responsibility for some time in the House of Lords but this case clearly illustrates that where there is sufficient evidence, even in challenging cases, the CPS will bring a prosecution, put evidence before a jury and see rightful convictions”, she added. A previous trial collapsed last year due to errors made by the prosecution. Ainslie conceded that “disclosure failures should not happen”, but the case showed the challenges faced in dealing with “huge amounts of information” and proper disclosure to the defence to allow a fair trial. “But the case also shows our determination to admit problems, overcome them and pursue the case, and the court’s ability to ensure the defendants receive a fair trial and their victims see justice,” she added.",News/UK news,Former peer Nazir Ahmed found guilty of serious sexual assault,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/05/former-peer-nazir-ahmed-found-guilty-of-serious-sexual-assault
1/6/2022,"Three men and a woman have been found not guilty of criminal damage after toppling the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston during a Black Lives Matter protest in Bristol, an act of public dissent that reverberated around the world. Rhian Graham, 30, Milo Ponsford, 26, and Sage Willoughby, 22, were accused, with “others unknown”, of helping to tie ropes around the statue’s neck and joining with others to pull it to the ground.  Jake Skuse, 33, was accused of helping to roll it to Bristol harbour where it was thrown into the River Avon. In a 10-day trial at Bristol crown court, the four defendants did not contest their actions on 7 June 2020 but sought to argue they were justified, because the statue was so offensive. Giving evidence in their own defence, each described being motivated out of sincere antiracist conviction, frustration that previous attempts to persuade the council to remove the statue had failed, and a belief that the statue was so offensive it constituted an indecent display or a hate crime. The prosecution, however, argued that the fact Colston was a slave trader was “wholly irrelevant”. William Hughes QC, for the crown, said the case was about “cold hard facts” and the “rule of law”. The prosecution showed jurors a CCTV video compilation capturing each of the four defendants playing roles in toppling Colston. Bristol council’s head of culture, Jon Finch, gave evidence of the damage caused to the statue, which lost a cane and part of a coattail. He confirmed £350 damage to the harbour railings and £2,400 damage to the pavement. The Colston statue was approved by the council in 1895 and it had not given permission to anyone to alter, damage or remove the statue on 7 June, the trial heard. But Liam Walker QC, representing Willoughby, said: “Each of these defendants were on the right side of history, and I submit, they were also on the right side of the law. “Colston’s deeds may be historical but the continued veneration of him in this city was not. The continued veneration of him in a vibrant multicultural city was an act of abuse.” Willoughby, who climbed the statue, told the court he targeted Colston “because he was a racist and a slave trader who murdered thousands and enslaved even more”” “I thought that a statue that celebrates a figure such as Colston was disgraceful, and offensive to the people of Bristol,” Ponsford told jurors. Graham, who also brought rope, said she acted out of “allyship and solidarity” with people of colour. Skuse admitted helping roll Colston to Pero’s bridge, named for an enslaved man who lived in Bristol, where it was thrown into the water, “sentencing [Colston] to death”. “I knew I was in the right, I knew everyone wanted it down,” he said. “I knew Bristol wanted it, everyone wanted the same thing.” Judge Peter Blair QC, the recorder of Bristol, allowed expert evidence from David Olusoga despite past comments by the historian and broadcaster that he “desperately” wanted to join protesters that day, which were raised as a sign of potential bias by the prosecution. Olusoga described to the court the horrors of the slave trade, from “rape rooms” in slaver fortresses on the African coast to grotesque punishments meted out to rebellious slaves. Colston was “chief executive officer” of a company that branded children as young as nine, and which was eventually responsible for enslaving more Africans than any other in British history, Olusoga said. The court heard from black Bristolians including a former lord mayor of the city, Cleo Lake, who had removed a portrait of Colston from her office. “He was the person responsible for brutalising my ancestors, taking away their humanity; and for me and my community experiencing the harm they still experience today,” Lake said. The four defendants laughed with relief as the verdicts were returned and hugged the many supporters that were waiting outside of court when they were released from the dock.",News/UK news,BLM protesters cleared over toppling of Edward Colston statue,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/05/four-cleared-of-toppling-edward-colston-statute

Meyers and Fallon join the over one million new cases of Covid reported in the US on Monday – a record high, though case reporting was delayed because of the holiday weekend. “See, it’s not really that bad,” Colbert said. “It’s like when an exterminator says, ‘don’t worry, a thousand rats didn’t just move into your breakfast nook. It was just one rat, who gave birth over the weekend to a thousand rats.’” The Omicron fifth wave of Covid has forced school districts in Newark, Milwaukee, Cleveland and Atlanta to shift back to remote learning. “No! I long for the good ole days when our kids could safely go to school to butt-chug tide pods,” the Late Show host joked. “Obviously this is a big strain on parents,” he continued, as some were given just hours of notice for the school closures. “Parents need emergency childcare help now,” he said. “I am calling on the federal government to release our strategic reserve of mothers-in-law. You know their motto: ‘I see you’re too busy to empty the bathroom trashcan …’” Nevertheless, Colbert continued, certain Republicans continue making idiotic comments about Covid, such as Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who told a radio show on Monday: “Why have we assumed that the body’s natural immune system isn’t the marvel that it really is? Why do we think that we can create something better than God in terms of – in terms of combating disease?” “OK, yes, I get it – God created our immune systems. He also created Ron Johnson, so he has been known to shank it,” Colbert responded. “So he raises the question: does the Lord want you to have the vaccine? I don’t know, but take Ron Johnson’s advice, and you might have a chance to ask God face to face.” And in other news, Apple became the first company in history to reach a $3tn market value on Monday – larger than the gross domestic products of Britain and India, and more valuable than all of the world’s cryptocurrencies “but not even half as annoying”, said Colbert. The California-based company has been on a steep growth trajectory in recent years, hitting the $1tn valuation in 2018, then $2tn in 2020 and a year and a half later, $3tn. “Hopefully, with that kind of cash, they can finally afford to fix that bite in their logo,” Colbert quipped.",Arts/Culture,Stephen Colbert on Omicron school closures: ‘Release strategic reserve of mothers-in-law’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/05/stephen-colbert-omicron-school-closures
1/6/2022,"Millions of customers of Virgin Media and Virgin Mobile are facing price increases in spring, with TV and broadband subscribers typically set to pay £56.40 more a year for the services. Subscribers to Virgin Media’s cable TV and broadband service will see bills rise by an average of £4.70 a month from 1 March.  Virgin Mobile customers face a change in the terms and conditions of their deal which will introduce an annual price change for their calls set at 3.9% above January’s RPI inflation rate. Currently, prices rise each year in line with RPI. The latest RPI figure, for November, was 7.1%, and if inflation remains at this level customers will face a double-digit price increase, coming into effect in April. The increases come against a backdrop of rising prices, which has prompted economists to predict that 2022 will be the “year of the squeeze” for UK households. Virgin Media said the price rises would allow it to keep up with demand from customers, who have increased their data use dramatically since 2019. At the end of last year, customers were on average using 40% more data than in 2019, driven by a switch to working from home and spending more leisure time in their living rooms. However, customers with Virgin Media’s Oomph bundled deal, which includes the mobile service alongside broadband, will be excluded from the mobile price change. So too will vulnerable customers, including those on the company’s Essential broadband package for people receiving universal credit, or its Talk Protected landline offer. A Virgin Media spokesperson said: “While we recognise a price change is never welcome, with rising costs and our customers using their services more than ever, we are reviewing our pricing to fuel further investment in our network and services, both now and in the future.“We’re committed to providing brilliant services and excellent overall value, and consistently give our customers more for their money than anyone else.” Virgin Mobile customers have their payments split into two parts, one to cover the cost of their handset and one to cover airtime, and it is only the latter that will go up in price. For a customer currently paying £35 a month for an iPhone 12 and watch with an airtime plan with 12Gb of data, £25 a month pays for the devices and will not be affected. The other part of the deal will go up. If RPI remains at 7.1%, this will add £1.10 a month to their bill.",News/Media,Millions of Virgin Media and Virgin Mobile customers face price rises,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/05/millions-of-virgin-media-and-virgin-mobile-customers-face-price-rises
1/6/2022,"Several miles south of the small town of San Juan, Texas, beyond acres of onion fields, orange groves and other cash crops sits a historic cemetery and the site of the beginning of a slow decay of American soil. I hadn’t been to this area for more than a year because of the pandemic, and I was startled at how different this remote part of Texas had become. The most obvious change is the steel 18ft-high bollard fencing, among the last vestiges of Donald Trump’s glorious border wall with Mexico.  Trump visited this site in June with Governor Greg Abbott to tout his accomplishments in controlling the border and to praise Abbott for taking up the anti-immigrant baton that resonates so well with the conservative voting base in Texas. The last time I came to visit this spot, no wall existed and the historic cemetery – the Eli Jackson cemetery – was under a 24-hour vigil by a Native American tribe called the Carrizo/Comecrudo, as well as other supporters who feared a border wall would destroy sacred burial land and a sacred piece of history. The Eli Jackson family built this cemetery, designated a historic landmark by the state, on land owned by Nathanial Jackson, Eli’s father. Nathaniel was a slave owner from Alabama who fell in love with and married one of his slaves, Matilda Hicks, before the two fled to the banks of the Rio Grande in 1857 and settled on the border with Mexico. Nathaniel was known for his generosity to visitors and his ranch soon began a relatively unknown line of the vaunted Underground Railroad in which fleeing slaves escaped servitude and, with the Jackson family’s help, fled to Mexico where slavery was forbidden. The Carrizo/Comecrudo tribe and its descendants also claim this area and, with the permission of the landowners, set up a camp in January 2019 to fend off any wall construction. Many of the inhabitants who camped out said they were veterans of the Keystone pipeline protests in northern Minnesota. And given the supply tent and other facilities that were erected adjacent to the Eli Jackson cemetery there was a suggestion that organizers hoped that a similarly large protest would develop in south Texas to fight the border wall. And despite a 24-hour vigil, often by as few as one or two diehard protesters in heat and cold for nearly a year in 2019, the efforts to protect the cemetery fell victim to Covid in 2020. As federal construction crews erected Trump’s wall ever closer to the cemetery, the landowners finally told the protesters to vacate. Soon, a large sign declaring the cemetery closed and camping prohibited was posted and the steel bollards marking the wall’s arrival began to overtake the horizon less than 100 yards from the burial grounds. When I returned to this remote site, about a mile from the Rio Grande, the first thing I noticed was a road to get over an earthen flood levee and back to the cemetery was closed; a sign said the area was now a construction zone, a Trump border wall just a few yards east of the road. I found another road that circled around to the cemetery. The protesters’ area of encampment, once a cleared field, was now the site of overgrown vegetation, leaving little evidence of human habitation for the better part of a year, suggesting the border wall decay has begun. It’s a decay that marks the beginning of a no man’s land: virtually uninhabitable, threatening because of its isolation, essentially a chunk of US territory that might as well belong to Mexico. That’s because in south Texas the term border wall is a misnomer because of the unpredictability of the Rio Grande and a treaty with Mexico. While the great river is dammed and channeled along its international path through Texas, the Rio Grande can still bite back with massive and unpredictable flooding. One attempt to mitigate the threat resulted in a treaty with Mexico that was signed during the Nixon administration that prevents either side from altering the flow of the river with land impediments – something like a border wall. To protect from flooding in south Texas, a long, mostly earthen levee generally follows the route of the Rio Grande from about a mile away. So, while border walls in Arizona and California may straddle the border with Mexico, those in south Texas are typically located atop or adjacent to the levee system, meaning that this so-called protective barrier is ceding about a mile of US territory behind the wall, effectively creating a no man’s land. It was true under the wall that was built by the George W Bush administration and it’s true of the walls that were erected during the Trump administration. Beyond the threat the creation of a no man’s land has to private homeowners and their property values, this region is also rich in ecological sites along the river. One of these, called the Southmost Preserve, is a thousand-acre wildlife preserve home to one of the only two remaining large stands of native Mexican sabal palm. More than 900 acres of that preserve is now in a no man’s land south of a Bush wall and locals generally avoid it because of the potential danger a no man’s land poses. Another Bush wall runs near the historic Hidalgo Pumphouse Museum and World Birding Center in the city of Hidalgo. Several nature trails run behind this area. But many of those trails are now behind a border wall and impassable or too dangerous to enter. Critics had predicted that a Trump border wall in this region would have the same no-man’s-land result. What I didn’t realize was how quickly the negative effects of this isolated land would be felt. Aside from all the warnings to keep out when I recently visited the Jackson cemetery, there was an emptiness in this area that I had never felt before. An isolation that hinted at vulnerability. The irony of this situation is that Texas, a state that brags about its commitment to property rights, continues its fight to finish the border wall. But I noticed that there was one section of the Trump wall that was about a mile long in this area. Then there was a mile-long gap before another section of wall began. So, this barrier effectively did little to deter unauthorized immigration because the migrants simply need to walk a mile or two in either direction to go around the wall. But this barrier, this big, beautiful wall, as Trump called it, that was built to protect US citizens from the “invasion” of migrants, was only truly effective at something else: keeping US citizens away from the no man’s land that it created and ceding the territory to Mexico.

Well, it was conceived in the early 1960s by erstwhile Football League boss Alan Hardaker (Little England) in the petty hope of distracting clubs from the new-fangled European scene, a gambit which it would be fair to say had limited success. As a result, the competition has struggled somewhat for an identity ever since. Po’ League Cup! League Cup’s a-cold!

1/6/2022,"Emmanuel Macron faced criticism from political opponents and heated scenes in parliament on Wednesday after he gave a deliberately provocative warning to unvaccinated French people, saying he would make their lives as difficult as possible by curbing their access to spaces such as cafés and restaurants. A crucial parliamentary debate on introducing a proposed Covid-19 “vaccine pass” for entry to areas such museums and long-distance trains was to resume on Wednesday afternoon.  The debate had been suspended just before 2am on Wednesday as lawmakers expressed outrage at Macron’s newspaper interview in which he said the 5 million people who had not had vaccines against the coronavirus were “irresponsible” and that he “really wanted” to “put them in the shit” by making their daily lives as complicated as possible. The French government spokesman, Gabriel Attal, warned there would be a “supersonic” rise in Covid cases in France in the coming days and that infections were reaching stratospheric levels in the Ile-de-France area around Paris as well as some in other regions. He said the situation in hospitals could worsen in the coming weeks. France recorded a record rate of almost 300,000 Covid infections on Tuesday. The government, in a hardening of current rules, is seeking to make it mandatory for people to show proof of Covid-19 vaccination to enter cafés, restaurants, museums, cinemas and theatres, or to use long-distance trains. Repeated disruptions and clashes in parliament, as well as hundreds of proposed amendments, are leaving the government struggling to push the law through before its deadline of 15 January. In an interview with readers of Le Parisien newspaper published on Wednesday, Macron, the French president, deliberately used the verb “emmerder”, which is derived from the word “merde” or “shit” and is widely used in France and considered vulgar slang. He said that he “really wanted” to put the non-vaccinated “in the shit” by making their lives very complicated and “limiting as much as possible their access to activities in social life”. Macron said: “We have to tell [the unvaccinated] ... you will no longer be able to go to a restaurant, you will no longer be able to go for a coffee, you will no longer be able to go to the theatre, you will no longer be able to go to the cinema. We will continue to do this, to the end. This is the strategy.” He explained that he could not force French people to get vaccinated on pain of prison or fines but life could be made very difficult for them without a vaccine. In parliament, opposition parties slammed Macron’s choice of language as unfit for a president and worrying in terms of voting through the new law. Christian Jacob, president of the opposition, right-wing Les Républicains party, told parliament: “A president cannot say such things ... I’m in favour of the vaccine pass but I cannot back a text whose objective is to put French people in the shit.” Damien Abad, from the same party, slammed what he called unworthy, irresponsible and premeditated remarks which showed “childish cynicism”. On the left, there was outrage over more of Macron’s comments, when, referring to unvaccinated people, he said that when some people’s freedom threatened those of others they became irresponsible, adding: “Someone irresponsible is not a citizen.” Mathilde Panot, head of the parliamentary group for the left’s La France Insoumise party, told the house: “We won’t keep debating a text you presented as a protection of the French people and which is in fact a text to put a part of the French population in the shit and which has invented [the notion of] stripping French citizenship – by saying irresponsible people are no longer French citizens.” Macron is expected to seek re-election in the presidential elections this April. However his key challenger, Valérie Pécresse, of Les Républicains, told French TV that he was dividing the nation by making some citizens seem better than others. “It’s not up to the president of the republic to pick out good and bad French people,” Pécresse said. France needed a government to “unite people and calm things down”, she added. But government figures and Macron allies stood by the president’s calculated choice of words and the strategy to make daily life very hard for unvaccinated people. Macron is no stranger to rows over off-the-cuff comments or slang, telling interviewers last month that he regretted some of his comments of the past five years, saying “I’ve learned to have a lot more respect for everyone”. But the vehemence of his comments about unvaccinated people and his deliberate choice of hard language was aimed at his own electorate, which is almost entirely vaccinated, and it was also a pre-election message to address the widespread exasperation at the Covid crisis in France. Although France has historically had more vaccine sceptics than many of its neighbours, it has one of the highest Covid-19 vaccination rates in the EU. A majority of people is in favour of vaccination; about 90% of French people aged 12 and over are vaccinated. The number of unvaccinated people in French hospital critical wards is higher than those who are vaccinated, and the health minister has said that the small minority of unvaccinated people in France, numbering around five million, is too many. Christophe Castaner, a key Macron ally and head of his grouping in parliament, said: “The president’s comments gave clarity, and we need that at this difficult moment for the country.” Castaner said that the president was giving a view that lots of French people shared. Olivier Véran, the health minister, told parliament, that the aim of Macron’s entire interview was “the protection of the French people”. Marc Fesneau, minister for parliamentary relations, said: “We need unvaccinated people to hear the message being sent to them by the government, parliament and the president – which is a message of responsibility.”",News/World news,Macron rebuke to unvaccinated citizens incurs anger in parliament,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/macron-rebuke-to-unvaccinated-citizens-incurs-anger-in-parliament
1/6/2022,"A New York biology teacher is facing up to four years in prison for allegedly giving a Covid-19 vaccine to a 17-year-old boy against his mother’s wishes – and despite not being a trained medical professional with authorization to do so. Laura Russo, who teaches at Herricks high school on Long Island, reportedly administered the jab to one of her son’s friends after he asked for it. The teen’s mother had not wanted him to be inoculated against the deadly virus and did not consent to the injection.  Video published by NBC New York allegedly shows Russo giving the shot at her residence in Sea Cliff, a village on Long Island. “There you go, at-home vaccine,” someone says in the background. The boy later told his mother what had happened. She alerted the police, who arrested Russo on New Year’s Eve after finding that she was not a medical professional and was not authorized to give vaccines. Russo has been charged with unauthorized practice of a profession under New York state education law, a felony offense that carries a sentence of up to four years, the Washington Post reported. She has been released and is expected to appear in court on 21 January, police said. District officials for the Herricks public schools said the incident was not school-related and Russo “has been removed from the classroom and reassigned pending the outcome of the investigation”. It is unclear how Russo obtained the vial of an approved Covid-19 vaccine, which only medical professionals and healthcare facilities are able to order, according to the Post. Experts frown upon unauthorized Covid-19 vaccinations as generally dangerous and ill-advised, given the complexities of administering the jab. Intramuscular injections like the Covid-19 vaccines require specific training even for medical professionals, and the mRNA technology can break down if it is not stored and handled correctly. “Besides being illegal, it’s just not a smart thing to do,” Aaron Glatt, the chair of the department of medicine at Mount Sinai South Nassau, told NBC New York. “An authorized, licensed professional should be providing vaccines to know how to give them properly – to make sure if there’s a complication, that can be dealt with immediately and very efficiently.”",News/US news,US teacher accused of giving Covid vaccine to teenager against mother’s wishes,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/new-york-teacher-covid-vaccine-teenager
1/6/2022,"Maureen Lipman has criticised the casting of Helen Mirren as Golda Meir in a forthcoming film about the former Israeli prime minister, saying that the character’s Jewishness is “integral”. In comments reported by the Jewish Chronicle, Lipman said she “disagreed” with Mirren’s casting. She added: “I’m sure [Mirren] will be marvellous, but it would never be allowed for Ben Kingsley to play Nelson Mandela. You just couldn’t even go there.”  Meir, who died in 1978, was Israel’s prime minister between 1969 and 74. The new film, called Golda, directed by Israeli film-maker Guy Nattiv is set during the Yom Kippur war in 1973 and started shooting in November 2021. Production stills showing Mirren under heavy makeup were released, with Mirren, who is not Jewish, commenting: “Golda Meir was a formidable, intransigent and powerful leader … I only hope I do her justice!” The Jewish Chronicle’s piece cited a number of controversial instances of “Jewface”, including Tamsin Greig’s recent suggestion that she ‘probably’ should not have been cast in the sitcom Friday Night Dinner and the row over a stage production of the musical Falsettos in 2019, which contained no Jewish cast or crew members. It also quoted actor and comic Sarah Silverman’s comments on the mooted casting of Kathryn Hahn as Joan Rivers in a TV series: “Right now, representation fucking matters. It has to also finally matter for Jews as well. Especially Jewish women.” In contrast, the playwright and director Patrick Marber was quoted in the Jewish Chronicle article as objecting to the primacy of “lived experienced” in casting decisions, saying: “I fucking hate that expression.

1/6/2022,"A Palestinian man on a hunger strike in protest against detention without charge has agreed to end his fast after a deal was struck for his release owing to fears of unrest if he died. Hisham Abu Hawash, 40, a construction worker from Dura in the West Bank, had previously served time in an Israeli jail after pleading guilty to terrorism offences related to membership of Islamic Jihad. He was rearrested and has been held without charge or trial for more than a year, and began refusing food in August.  His lawyer said on Tuesday night that Abu Hawash had agreed to end the 141-day strike – believed to be the longest by a Palestinian prisoner since 2013 – after a deal was reached between Israeli and Palestinian Authority (PA) officials to release him next month. A medical team from the International Committee of the Red Cross that visited the prisoner last week said he was in “critical condition”, warning of “potentially irreversible health consequences and possible tragic loss of life”. The deal comes amid mounting support for Abu Hawash in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the form of street demonstrations, along with a widespread campaign for his release on social media, where pictures of the gaunt prisoner lying in a hospital bed have circulated widely. Islamic Jihad, the second-largest militant group in Gaza, had threatened revenge if he died in custody, and Hamas called the issue a “red line”. The married father of five, who denies being a member of Islamic Jihad, is being held under Israel’s practice of administrative detention, which allows suspects’ arrest for renewable six-month terms without charge or access to the evidence against them. Israel says the measure – which is also practised by the PA – is necessary for foiling terrorist attacks and to avoid revealing sensitive intelligence sources. Rights groups allege it is used excessively and routinely by Israeli authorities and denies individuals the right to due process. Abu Hawash’s release date of 26 February will mark the end of his current six-month detention period, a compromise struck with PA officials that allowed Israel to claim it had decided not to renew his detention, rather than shorten it. In return, the PA agreed to ensure the prisoner “will not return to terrorism”. After accepting the terms of the deal, Abu Hawash, who had begun to lose consciousness for long periods of time, broke his fast on Tuesday night with a few sips of tea. He had previously refused all medical intervention and stopped consuming small amounts of sugar and salt six weeks ago. He was transferred to an Israeli civilian hospital on 26 December and will remain there under armed guard until his release. The news was met with celebrations across the Palestinian territories on Tuesday night, while the Prisoners’ Club, which represents former and current Palestinian prisoners, hailed the strike as a victory. It said Abu Hawash had previously spent eight years in Israeli prisons, more than half of it in administrative detention. Palestinians in the occupied West Bank are subject to Israeli military courts, while Jewish settlers in the territory answer to the civilian justice system. According to the Palestinian rights group Addameer, 500 Palestinians are currently being held under the measure.",News/World news,Palestinian man to end hunger strike after Israel agrees to release,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/palestinian-man-end-hunger-strike-israel-agrees-release

1/6/2022,"Back in 2005, Ashley Giles played what is still one of my favourite Test innings, when he made 59 on the fifth day of the fifth Test at the Oval. It was his top-score in Test cricket at the time his team needed it the most. And because it was played in the shade of Kevin Pietersen’s 158 at the other end, it went almost unnoticed. Which felt characteristic. Giles always seemed like that team’s Guildenstern, a steady lower-order bat and a spinner who often didn’t turn the ball at all. We called him the Wheelie Bin because of his ungainly action, or the King of Spain, because of a misprint on a souvenir mug. He hated the nicknames, and, understandably enough, resented the idea that he was being laughed at. Because, of course, he took his game seriously. He had to. Giles operated on the reaches of his own talent, and it was hard work out there. There was a prickliness to him that occasionally burst into the open. Like the time he marched into the press box in 2007 and confronted a journalist who had teased him in print for having the “temerity to remark that Tendulkar’s batting prowess had waned a little”. Giles didn’t like that at all. The journalist explained he was only being ironic. “What’s irony?” Giles shouted.  You could hear some of that side of him in his latest interviews in Australia where, as the England and Wales Cricket Board’s managing director of cricket, he had to try to explain how and why England had managed to make such a mess of an Ashes series for which they had spent two years planning. It was an odd interview, which contained criticisms of previous England teams (“In the 90s that was accepted as normal for England leaderships and they got away with it, we set our standards much higher than that”), of “armchair selectors”, of England’s spinners (“We’ve got to have a spin resource that allows us to bowl much more overs of spin”), fast bowlers (“We need a variation in our bowling attack but we need pace”), and batsmen (“With first innings scores of 147, 236, 185, we’re not winning many Test matches”), as well as digs at county cricket (“I think there is a dearth of leadership and in the county game”) and the international schedule. Giles also said he was at peace with the idea that he was accountable for it all. He just didn’t sound like he believed it. He came across as thin-skinned and indignant that he wasn’t being given more credit for his own modest achievements. “When I came into the job we were fifth in the world in Test cricket, third in the world in Twenty20 cricket and No 1 in the world in ODIs. We’re now fourth, first in T20 and second in ODIs.” Now Giles is working on his review of what went wrong. He said he didn’t want to go into his ideas for “how I want to take this team forward and improve our red ball cricket”, but he still gave a good idea of what his conclusions are likely to be. “It’s been an extraordinary year and I think we can look at the cricket-specific stuff but we also need to look at the other stuff, particularly having 18 scheduled Test matches,” he said. “It’s a huge amount of cricket we’re playing and in a time of Covid it’s been pretty horrendous at times.” The players are reaching “their very top limit” of what they can deal with. On top of that, Giles said, what is needed now is systemic change, collective responsibility, and collective solutions. “We can make whatever changes we want. You can change me, change the head coach, change the captain. But we’re only setting up future leaders for failure.” Which underplays the degree to which getting the leadership team in place could transform the sport in this country. In the short term, the difference between a good side and a bad one often is as simple as a change in the coach and the team culture. Just ask Eddie Jones. And the simple truth is, everything is better in English cricket when the England team are winning. If Giles is right and more systemic change is needed, the pressing question is whether, given his track record in the job, he is the right man to lead it, given that he made such a mess of the (well-intentioned) rotation policy, and the mistake of binning the head selector to load more responsibility onto the coach. Same goes for Tom Harrison, the ECB’s chief executive, who, though not directly responsible for the England team’s performance, has had a hand in the congested schedule, the collapse of the Pakistan tour, the mismanagement of the racism scandal, and who also blew a ridiculous amount on a needless launch of a divisive new competition, the Hundred, which is now the single greatest obstacle to sorting out the first-class cricket schedule. And yet Harrison continues. As for Giles, he looks now like he did as a player; a man trying hard to prove he can do it but who has gone as far as he can on the talents he has. “This is a good bunch of guys here,” the 48-year-old said. No one ever said they weren’t. No one ever said that was the point, either.",Sport/Sport,Giles’s scattergun broadsides suggest a man who has gone as far as he can | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/05/giless-scattergun-broadsides-suggest-a-man-who-has-gone-as-far-as-he-can
1/6/2022,"Jon Needham looks like a copper. Tall, broad and imposing, he works in a lifetime offender management unit, where he deals with serious and organised criminals. So when he speaks, his gentleness comes as a surprise. “I joined the police because I was passionate about helping people,” he says. “It sounds like a cliche to say you want to make a real difference, but I genuinely mean it.” Needham gets paid for working with “nominals” – people who are on the police database (“That’s what the police call them, I call them people,” he says). But he is also transforming how his colleagues deal with victims of rape and sexual assault.  It took him until he was 45 to tell the story of the abuse he suffered as a child in foster care. In 2019, he detailed to a group of 70 officers from his own force, the City of London, how he was treated by the criminal justice system after he went to court. “I wanted police officers to see what it’s like from the voice of the survivor. After what I’ve lived through, I thought, well, if I can use that to help people in a positive way, that’d be great.” The number of people being convicted for rape is at a record low – just 1.6% of the 52,210 rapes recorded by police in England and Wales in 2020 resulted in a charge or a summons – and confidence in the criminal justice system is at rock bottom, so the work has never been more urgent. In June, a government report into the staggering decline in rape prosecutions, which have plummeted by 70% since 2016-17, prompted ministers to apologise unreservedly to rape survivors, saying they were “deeply ashamed” that thousands of survivors had been failed on the government’s watch. New plans promised to switch the focus of police investigations away from the credibility of victims, who have been subject to “digital strip searches”. These include having mobile phones taken away and text messages unrelated to a case being used against them in court – as well as notes from counselling and therapy being used to undermine cases. Instead, the focus will be on the perpetrator, the report claimed. The report is progress, Needham says, but he is not going to wait for the system to transform itself. The stories of survivors, like him, have to be part of the solution. Needham was seven when he was taken into care, after his father was imprisoned for a crime he is still not able to talk about. “It was horrendous,” he says. “It just destroyed our family. My first memory is of a knock on the door and two coppers being there. They came in, the next minute my dad was in handcuffs, and then he was gone for years. The victims of crime are not just people who have been abused or robbed or hurt, it’s their families, and the families of the criminal – innocent family members who have to go through the torture of going to prison to visit them.” His mother, with five children and no money, became seriously mentally ill, and so the children were removed and put into care. His foster carers were quite elderly but seemed nice people. “Not my cup of tea, but you know, they are not your family so it’s not a pleasant experience,” he remembers. His bedroom was small, with a sash window. But there was another bedroom at the front of the house, and it was here that Needham says a much older boy raped him, almost every week, for about a year.Talking about the abuse as an adult, Needham is calm and matter-of-fact. Back then, he had no one to tell, he didn’t think he would be believed, and the older boy made terrifying threats about what would happen to him if he told anyone. The abuse went on for a year, until his father came out of prison and Needham went to live with him. “We had mattresses, a toaster, a kettle and a washing machine and that’s all we had for about a year, but for me, it was great. I thought ‘this is better than foster care’ – it was like an adventure: we had a back garden.” He taught himself to play the guitar and went to music school, but dropped out and played in bands. Through his 20s, he worked in a range of jobs, from property maintenance to retail, never sticking to one thing. “I was in the wilderness for many years,” he says. “I didn’t think I could do anything or was worth anything.” When a friend suggested he would make a good police officer, he initially thought it was impossible – he was dyslexic and had no qualifications. But after applying, and failing several times, he made it into the force in 2009. “It felt amazing, almost like validation, even though I knew the training would be tough,” he says. “But I suffered a lot from impostor syndrome, and even now I look over my shoulder and wonder if it’s real.” He recently got a commander of commendation award for dealing with serious prolific offenders, having been given a commissioner’s commendation award in 2018 for professionalism and bravery in dealing with a violent offender. “It does make me feel like I finally belong and deserve to be here. I’m getting there,” he says. Needham didn’t disclose what had happened to him as a child when he joined the force – he had still told no one – but, after joining the police, the feeling that he had a responsibility to report his abuser grew. “I felt guilty about not reporting it for years,” he says. “I thought: ‘This guy must have gone on to do it again.’” So he picked up the phone. Two officers came to his house. “They did a video statement – it was the first time I’d ever fully recounted the story – and they forgot to press record. It’s not a criticism of the officers, but I mention it now in my talk to officers – make sure you know the equipment and make sure you know it’s working.” He adds that, for survivors, constantly having to relive their trauma just compounds the damage. “When you do decide to come forward, you sort of mentally prepare yourself, there is an adrenaline high. If you get off that rollercoaster and then have to get back on, it will bring back memories and you can suffer from PTSD.” Needham was called several times by the investigating officer in the case, asking if he was sure he wanted to go to trial. “It felt like he was trying to talk me out of it,” he says. “I’m sure that wasn’t the case, but that’s what it felt like. So I said, ‘Yeah, I’m determined.’ Why would I report it if I’m not going to go through with it?” When his day in court arrived, Needham saw his attacker again for the first time since he left foster care. He declined to use a screen or give evidence by video link. “I said to the officer: ‘I want to look the guy in the eye. Whatever happens, I’m going to sit there and I’m going to look at him and tell the jury what he’s done to me.’” Needham had worked in the police for years by this time, and was accustomed to tough questioning, but found the defence barrister particularly confrontational. “I felt like I was on trial,” he says. “They’re just constantly trying to trip you up on every single thing. He asked me about care homes in the area and whether I’d visited any of them, trying to deliberately confuse me. The barrister was very snotty, very intimidating. I remember standing there, shaking; I was petrified. “I think, emotionally, I was not ready for it, because you’re never ready for these things. By the end, I felt traumatised.” After a week-long trial, the jury was released and took two days to come back: the result was hung. Six months later, he was back in court again. He started getting panic attacks. “I sort of pretended I didn’t have all that, you know, because I’m in the police service, I wanted to be tough.” But when giving evidence, he broke down. “I cried like a baby, I know it sounds … the judge paused it for a little while, and then went back in and finished my evidence. Afterwards, I thought, I’ve left everything I’ve got in that courtroom, and I’ve done everything I can, psychologically, emotionally, physically. And if I don’t get a result then the system’s not working.” The case went to a hung jury a second time. The man he said had attacked him walked free. “I’d been walking up and down my living room for days and they couldn’t come to a decision. It was a nightmare, even now it makes my skin crawl to think about it.” Needham’s mental health collapsed. “I went home and stayed in my bedroom for three months. Pretty much just shaking, jumping at noises, you know […] I wouldn’t go out, I didn’t eat, I was sleeping all day and up all night. I was really angry for about six months, asking what had gone wrong, what I could have done to convince them. I felt disbelieved, like I was a criminal – like every part of my life had been under the microscope. I was mortified.” He was diagnosed with PTSD, signed off work for three months, and started the long process of getting well. “Having counselling was the best thing I ever did: I just talked and talked to this poor lady. She was an amazing, amazing person.” Since that final trial, Needham has rebuilt his life. He met his German wife, an engineer, in 2014, at a blues club where he was playing, and she helped to make him laugh again. “She’s incredibly supportive of the work I do and appreciates me being open about my past,” he says. “I said to her when we met that I’m looking forward, not back. You can’t drive a car if you’re looking in your rear-view mirror.” He also has a positive relationship with his daughter from a previous relationship. In addition, he mentored 13 to 15 year olds with the Prince’s Trust. “They started by calling me ‘the Feds’,” he says. “By the end of the term, I had them dressing up in police forensic kits and uniforms, completing mock crime scene inquiries, asking me about how to join up, and calling me Officer Needham or Sir.” At the end of July he spent 24 hours locked in a cell to raise money for the Survivors Trust. With the charity’s support, he is now developing a network of trained victim survivor ambassadors, available to visit all 43 police forces in England and Wales, to give survivors a voice and provide vital insight to officers working on sexual abuse cases. “I didn’t get closure at the trial but I’m glad I did it,” he says. “I felt the justice system had no empathy. It’s not about people. To me, it felt more about just getting through the caseload they had. I was just another case number on their paper. And that’s what I’m trying to change – hopefully, the work I do now will have more impact than one conviction. “I’ve been through the system, I’ve been through hell and back. I’ve hidden in my bedroom for three months, I’ve had to be dragged out. But I can tell my story – about how I’ve got from that to where I am today”. He says the recent government rape review means “we are getting support from the senior level. It’s been a battle against the wind, but we have momentum now.” He pauses for breath, and lets out a short laugh. “I’m so passionate about it, I’m going to keep on going until we get the system we need,” he says. “Now I’ve started talking, no one is ever going to shut me up.”",News/Society,Jon Needham: the man who went to hell and back as a child – and now fights for all rape victims,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/05/jon-needham-child-rape-victims-abuse-court-police-officer-survivors
1/6/2022,"About this time 28 years ago the star of Swindon Town’s only season in the top flight finally started scoring. Jan Åge Fjørtoft had been signed in the summer of 1993 for a club‑record £1.3m to spearhead Swindon’s attack on the Premier League but he failed to find the net in the first half of the campaign and was on his way out until a goal in an FA Cup third-round replay against Ipswich in January 1994 triggered a dramatic change in his fortunes. But not, alas, in those of Swindon, whose elan going forward could not offset ramshackle defending. The club wound up being relegated after conceding 100 goals, the first top‑flight team in 30 years to reach that undignified milestone and still the only team to do so in the Premier League era.  “I almost get tears in my eyes when I talk about my first goal in that January,” says Fjørtoft, a 54-year-old pundit for television channels in Germany and his native Norway, before Swindon play Manchester City in the Cup’s third round on Friday. He cherishes his memories of Swindon and of a season in which he and his team endured harrowing lows while trying, and sometimes succeeding, to play stylish and enterprising football. “We conceded 100 goals, finished bottom and are considered the symbol of a side not doing well in the Premier League but we weren’t a bad side, we were not that far away,” says Fjørtoft. “We were a very good football team with a lot of good players and we were quite confident on the ball. To be fair, we were useless at defending.” Swindon had won promotion to the top flight with such brio that their manager, Glenn Hoddle, was hired by Chelsea, leaving his assistant, John Gorman, to plot their assault on the Premier League. He was determined to stay faithful to their slick passing approach. Signing Fjørtoft was supposed to add a sharper tip to their attack. To be fair, he was useless at first. Swindon did not win until they beat Queens Park Rangers 1-0 in their 16th league match, by which time Fjørtoft, still goalless, had been dropped. “In the first game of the season at Sheffield United [lost 3-1], I got a knock,” says Fjørtoft, bought after four free-scoring seasons with Rapid Vienna. “I had never been injured in my life and that was the start of a bad circle for me. I kept on playing because I was desperate to get that first goal and contribute to our first win. We were suffering heavy losses and it became the first time in my life that I didn’t score goals. I started to doubt myself. When you start losing your self-confidence, you make compromises in the way you play and then you kind of drag yourself further into the dump. By the time of that win against QPR, I was struggling. “Then Christmas Eve of 1993 was the lowest point of my career. I played for Swindon reserves against Wycombe Wanderers reserves on one of these fantastic facilities you have in England with like 12 pitches next to each other. It was cold and windy, I was freezing to death and I was the worst player on the pitch. I remember I came home and opened the door and said dramatically to my wife: ‘Have a look at me now because no one can ever get lower in their football career than I am now.’” Paradoxically, Fjørtoft was thriving on the international stage. But to retain his place in the Norway side for the 1994 World Cup he needed to improve his club form, so he negotiated a loan to Lillestrøm. “I had agreed it with them but then came the Cup game against Ipswich.” Fjørtoft scored in a game Swindon lost 2-1. “The next morning I went into Swindon town centre to get something for my wife and I saw posters for the local paper with the headline ‘Please don’t go, Jan.’ It was all over the place. That was an unbelievable moment.” An amazing transformation took place. Suddenly flush with confidence, Fjørtoft cancelled the loan and became convinced he would open his Premier League account against Tottenham four days later, in Swindon’s 27th league game. “After 20 minutes [the Spurs goalkeeper] Erik Thorstvedt, who was my roommate with the national team, got injured and as he was being carried off I went up to him and screamed, ‘Fucking coward!’ because I somehow knew I was going to score my first goal in the Premier League. I thought he wasn’t daring enough to stay on.” Fifteen minutes later Fjørtoft did indeed score, flicking the ball over Colin Calderwood before thrashing it past Thorstvedt’s replacement, Ian Walker. The floodgates opened: in the final 16 games of the season Fjørtoft scored 12 goals, a tally bettered only by Southampton’s Matt Le Tissier. “I developed a very good understanding with Nicky Summerbee, who was one of the best crossers of the ball I played with,” says Fjørtoft. “I used to say I had no clue why I couldn’t score in the first half of the season and then scored for fun in the second half but now, when I look back, I see it’s about that circle you get into with a lack of confidence.” It was not enough to save Swindon. Although they scored more goals than Aston Villa and Coventry, who both finished in the top half, their inability to plug their leaky defence meant they won five of 42 matches. Their heaviest defeat came in March when they lost 7-1 at Newcastle. “We were sitting on the bus on the way home and Shaun Taylor – our captain and warrior – said: ‘Well at least Andy Cole didn’t score.’ And I said: ‘Every other Newcastle player did!’ The next day John Gorman – who I love – came to me and said: ‘Jan, we did some great passing yesterday.’ That sums up our season. We loved our game. We just wanted to play. “You could call it naive, that’s probably the right analysis, but [Gorman] was a romantic. He really loved passes: if we made five passes, it was almost like three points for him and I say that in a positive way. He just loved to play football. I think it’s cool you have guys like that in the game. “The other thing to say is that if we were a team who had played very disciplined and sat back and all that, I’m not sure we would have got more points.”",Sport/Football,Jan Åge Fjørtoft: ‘I almost get tears when I talk about my first Swindon goal’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/05/jan-age-fjrtoft-i-almost-get-tears-when-i-talk-about-my-first-swindon-goal
