""You let people breach the Capitol."" ""Shut up, Lindsey!"" replied Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio. As senators gathered in a secure location amid the riot at the Capitol on January 6, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina was apoplectic, even complaining to a Capitol Police officer that the security force ""let people breach the Capitol."" That's according to reporting included in ""This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden, and the Battle for America's Future,"" a forthcoming book from the New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alex Burns. After their evacuation from the Senate chamber, senators had been taken to the secure location of SH-216, the Senate Judiciary Committee room in the Hart Senate Office Building. A Capitol police captain reportedly announced to the group that they were hoping to evacuating them onto busses behind the building. ""Right now, the Capitol is breached,"" the captain said. ""We need you to be patient and then we'll move you in orderly fashion."" Another office then began to speak, telling the senators that the plan ""is to come here in SH-216, hold until we determine what the next step is going to be—"" But then, Graham interrupted the officers. ""The next step is to get 'em out!"" said Graham. ""Whatever force you need to do. You're here to protect us. This is the center of democracy. You let people breach the Capitol."" The outburst reportedly drew the ire of fellow senators. ""Shut up, Lindsey!"" Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio reportedly yelled, as another person yelled to Graham that ""there are no cameras — come on!"" Graham's office did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. It has previously been reported that the South Carolina Republican wanted officers to use guns on the rioters. ""What are you doing? Take back the Senate! You've got guns. Use them,"" he reportedly told the Senate sergeant-at-arms. Graham, a one-time foe of former President Donald Trump, grew into becoming one of the president's closest allies and Senate confidantes, even after the riot. But that didn't stop him from airing his frustrations with Trump that day. ""Trump and I, we've had a hell of a journey. I hate it to end this way, oh my god, I hate it,"" Graham said on the floor after the Senate reconvened following the attack. ""From my point of view, he's been a consequential president... all I can say is count me out. Enough is enough. I've tried to be helpful.""   Read the original article on Business Insider",U.S./Business Insider,"Lindsey Graham complained to a Capitol Police officer that they 'let people breach the Capitol' while they tried to outline an evacuation plan on January 6, book says",https://news.yahoo.com/lindsey-graham-complained-capitol-police-180000263.html
4/30/2022,"Russia conducted a successful test of its new Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile. Sarmat is the largest nuclear-tipped missile ever built, tipping the scales at nearly half a million pounds. The missile was likely built to overcome U.S. missile defenses, but such a plan is not without risk. Russia has tested the world’s largest and heaviest nuclear missile, the RS-28 Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). The missile, which lifted off from northern Russia last week, weighs 458,000 pounds, or as much as 11 F-22A Raptor fighters. Sarmat can deliver up to ten thermonuclear warheads and has the range to strike anywhere on Earth. But as powerful as it is, the missile has distinct trade-offs that could make it less impressive than it sounds. 🇷🇺Today at 15:12 Moscow time, Sarmat, land-based intercontinental ballistic missile, was successfully launched from a silo at the Plesetsk state testing cosmodrome in Arkhangelsk Region. pic.twitter.com/xLsAUIDdIX — Минобороны России (@mod_russia) April 20, 2022 The Sarmat missile lifted off on April 20 from Russia’s Plesetsk Cosmodrome and delivered a warhead onto a target 500 miles away on the Kamchatka Peninsula. Russia’s TASS news agency, one of several government-controlled media outlets, quoted the country’s Ministry of Defense, stating: “The launch’s tasks were achieved in full. The designated characteristics were confirmed at all the stages of its flight. The practice warheads arrived at the designated area at the Kura proving ground on the Kamchatka Peninsula. “The new missile is capable of striking targets at long ranges, using different flight paths. The Sarmat features unique characteristics that enable it to reliably breach any existing and future anti-ballistic missile defenses.” (The Ministry of Defense website is currently offline to visitors from the United States.) TASS described Sarmat as “cutting-edge,” “powerful,” and a “breakthrough” weapon that will replace the Voyevoda ICBM (known to NATO as the SS-18 “Satan”) starting later this year. Here’s another perspective of the launch: 🇷🇺 Successful launch of Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile was held today at Plesetsk Cosmodrome from a silo launcher.🚀📹 Here is HD footage. pic.twitter.com/lzmygsolp8 — Минобороны России (@mod_russia) April 20, 2022 Sarmat is simply a large ICBM, the largest ICBM anyone has ever bothered to build. The three-stage, solid-fuel missile is 115 feet long and 9.8 feet wide with a total, fueled weight of 458,000 pounds. The missile can boost up to ten tons into low-Earth orbit, including, “Ten large warheads, 16 smaller ones, a combination of warheads and countermeasures, or hypersonic boost-glide vehicles.” Why is Sarmat so big? Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned the U.S. several times that its missile defense capabilities put Russia’s nuclear arsenal at risk. Under the policy of Assured Destruction, the United States and Russia—and indeed all the nuclear powers—intrinsically hold each other hostage to a counterattack, or “second strike,” with no one side able to attack the other with nuclear weapons without risking being attacked in return. If one side with missile defenses, such as the United States, is able to defend itself from nuclear attack, other potential adversaries might feel less secure, worrying that the U.S. could launch a surprise attack and defend itself from the inevitable second strike. The U.S. does have limited missile defenses in the form of the Ground-Based Interceptor, designed to protect the nation from a limited attack from rogue countries such as North Korea. But the system has less than 50 missiles and could credibly defeat an incoming attack of ten missiles or less at best. For countries like China and Russia, each with hundreds of missiles, that’s not a problem ... yet. However, both countries have expressed concerns that the U.S. missile defense system could be scaled upward to handle many more incoming missiles. Here’s a 2019 Ground-Based Interceptor test that involved intercepting an ICBM-like target: Sarmat will be able to launch up to ten large warheads at once, and in turn present enemy missile defenses with ten warheads to deal with at once. The idea is that even if the defender has enough interceptor missiles to go around, missiles like Sarmat can overwhelm the defender’s ability to shoot down threatening missiles at a specific moment, allowing at least some to slip through. Sarmat’s long range, up to 11,184 miles, also means planners could get creative with how the warheads approach their targets, perhaps going around local defenses.  Sarmat’s huge capacity is a double-edged sword. If the missile encounters a mechanical problem and fails to launch, that’s ten nuclear weapons stranded in Russia and a large hole in Moscow’s targeting plan. Russia’s ability to use Sarmat will also be constrained by the New START arms control treaty, which limits both the U.S. and Russia to 800 missile launchers or bombers and 1,550 deployed warheads. Just 150 Sarmat missiles, each maxed out with warheads, could carry almost all of Russia’s allowable nukes, leaving just 50 for the rest of Moscow’s nuclear triad, including mobile ICBMs such as the truck-mounted Topol-M, Borei-class missile submarines, and strategic heavy bombers. The constraints of New START make it likely Russia will build only a limited number of Sarmats in order to beat down U.S. missile defenses, giving the rest of Moscow’s nuclear forces a freer hand. Is all this necessary? The U.S. has no stated intention of boosting the number of missile interceptors in its arsenal, and even if it wanted to, doing so could be astronomically expensive. For now, Russia’s nuclear deterrent is secure, but as far as Moscow is concerned, it’s better to be safe than sorry. The war in Ukraine will also make Sarmat more useful, though more as a political tool than a military tool. Russia’s military is also taking a beating in Ukraine, and its conventional forces will take years to rebuild. In the early 1990s, a period of severe economic turmoil in Russia, nukes were the only credible defense Moscow had. That time is likely coming again, worsened by wartime economic sanctions imposed by the West. Being able to boast about having the largest missiles in the world, whether that matters or not, will be the kind of chest-puffing that keeps enemies at bay. That is, if Moscow can afford it.

4/30/2022,"How do we know when wearing a specific outfit is or isn’t appropriate for boarding an airline’s business class? A South Korean DJ learned this lesson the hard way. According to an article published by the Australian website Dmarge, DJ Hwang So-hee, known as DeeJay Soda, was kicked off her American Airlines business class flight for wearing pants that airline staff considered inappropriate. She also claims she was intimidated into taking them off in public. The artist was coming back from JFK to LAX with American Airlines. The incident happened because she was wearing pants with the inscription “F*ck you” all over the clothing. The pant was designed by a brand that sponsors the artist. “I was forced out of the plane and was harassed to take off my pants in front of the flight crews at the gate. I have never had an issue with wearing this pair of pants before in my many months of touring in North America and they did not have any problem with me wearing it at the time of check-in nor when I sat down at my seat,” DeeJay Soda said on her Instagram account. She has over 4,3 million followers. DeeJay Soda revealed that initially she entered the plane without any issues and was very welcomed by American Airlines business class crew members. She said that after boarding the flight, she was drinking in the airline’s business class when a staff suddenly approached her and took her off the plane with her belongings without any kind of explanation. “As I was escorted off the plane, they claimed that my sweatpants were ‘inappropriate’ and ‘offensive’ telling me that I need to take the next flight,” she commented. Soda added that she had an important meeting set up in LA on that day, and she did not have other options but to fly to LA on that AA flight. “I pleaded to stay on the flight but was ignored by the staff and the flight attendants. I even offered to get changed but the request was denied. What happened next was horrendous.” Then, in order to comply with the AA staff requirements and reboard the plane, she decided to take off her pants. “With my broken fingers, I hardly ended up taking off my pants in front of the whole crew and standing half-naked while they still refused to board me on the flight. They even sarcastically commented that I could have taken off my pants earlier. When they finally let me enter, I put my pants inside out and finally sat down after an hour of delay causing inconvenience to the members of the flights on board. I was mortified and trembling in fear for the next 6 hours on my flight back to LA.”
“
She added: “In my 8 years of touring, I have never experienced or been treated unfairly, especially in a country that is known for its freedom of speech and individuality.”",Business/Travel Noire,Passenger Kicked Off American Airlines Business Class For Wearing 'Inappropriate' Pants,https://news.yahoo.com/passenger-kicked-off-american-airlines-173552045.html
