2/12/2022,"Dozens of mainly young “kill the bill” protesters have been charged with riot – the most serious public order offence – following clashes in Bristol last year. The decision by Avon and Somerset police and the Crown Prosecution Service appears to be the biggest use of riot charges against demonstrators since the 1980s. The force launched one of its largest investigations after a confrontation between riot police and protesters opposed to the police and crime bill – which will allow the police to curb protests – spiralled into violent clashes outside a police station in Bristol on 21 March last year.  It has been accused of giving the impression of “revenge policing” and giving in to political influences. The police claimed mobs of people attacked officers, damaged police vans and a police station in a night of sustained violence. But MPs later heard evidence that the disorder was sparked by the police pepper-spraying and beating demonstrators taking part in a sit-down protest outside the station. The all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on democracy and the constitution also heard that the police’s use of force, including deploying dogs, batons, and shield strikes, known as “blading”, was often considered disproportionate in the days that followed. The report says it was not clear who struck first but that there was ‘“significant and serious” violence directed at police officers. At least 62 protesters reported injuries over the course of the week, including 22 with head wounds and seven who required hospital treatment, whereas 44 officers were hurt. The force withdrew widely reported claims that officers suffered broken bones and a punctured lung. Protesters charged with riot, which is rarely used and requires the sign-off of the director of public prosecutions, could face jail terms of up to 10 years. Analysis of Home Office figures shows only 22 people have been convicted of riot since 2011. Avon and Somerset police said it was still in the middle of one of its largest ever investigations after “police vehicles were damaged and set alight, officers were assaulted and our neighbourhood police station was vandalised during a riot in Bristol city centre on Sunday, 21 March 2021”. The charges against 38 protesters come amid growing concern from civil liberty groups that protesters are facing ever more serious public order charges, which could have an impact on the right to protest. Detectives are still seeking 34 people in connection with the Bristol clashes, so even more protesters could be charged with riot over the coming months. At least four of the people charged are homeless. Others have learning and mental health difficulties. Ryan Roberts – who attempted to set fire to occupied police vans in the most serious incidents of the night – has ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and was said to be living on the fringes of society. Roberts, of no fixed address, received a 14-year sentence in December. Many protesters face trials later this year but some have already gone to court. So far, 13 people have been sentenced to a total of more than 51 years in prison, including five charged with riot for kicking police shields, throwing items at police, kicking police station windows and hitting police vans. A woman was jailed for five months for urinating at the feet of an officer. Last week, Jasmine York, who was charged after she complained she was beaten by officers and mauled by a police dog at the protest, was cleared of riot by a jury. The court was shown footage of York, 26, being struck at least three times by batons and bitten by a police dog. She was convicted of a lesser charge of arson for pushing a wheelie bin towards a burning car and will be sentenced next month. Another woman, Mariella Gedge-Rogers, was found guilty of riot on Friday. Geraint Davies MP, the chair of the APPG on democracy and the constitution, which investigated the disturbances in Bristol, criticised the police. “They massively overreacted at the time and were found out after they misled the press and tried to mislead our inquiry,” he said. He questioned whether the riot charges appeared to be “seeking to punish peoplein an excessive and disproportionate way, not just for protesting but for challenging the police”. Davies added that the police should not be handed even more powers in the police and crime bill. “The police abuse the power they have but the government still want to give them all sorts of new powers to restrict protests. They need more accountability not less.” Avon and Somerset police added that the MPs’ report also recognised that officers faced real violence and hostility and put themselves on the line to keep people safe. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has taken an active interest in recent operational policing decisions in Bristol. She described the pulling down of the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in June 2020 as “utterly disgraceful” and demanded an explanation from the then-chief constable about why officers did not intervene. Patel and the prime minister, Boris Johnson, also backed the police’s version of events following the “kill the bill” protests in Bristol. Patel said the law-abiding majority would be appalled by the actions of a “criminal minority”, while Johnson gave the police his full support and branded the protest “a mob intent on violence”. Shami Chakrabarti, the former shadow attorney general, said she feared Avon and Somerset police had been influenced by the government’s increasingly harsh and authoritarian approach to public dissent. “Charging people with such serious public order offences is going to chill dissent and protest,” she said. “It is especially concerning when it comes after criticism of the force from the home secretary.” She added: “It is particularly worrying if people face serious charges after they have complained to the media about their treatment. Defensive and political policing only undermines public trust in the law.” Matt Foot, a criminal defence solicitor, who is co-writing a book on the policing of protests, said his research suggested the sheer number of demonstrators charged with riot in Bristol was almost unprecedented. “This is by far and away the biggest use of riot charges since the mid-1980s – and in all likelihood the most under the current public order act.”",News/UK news,‘Kill the bill’: surge in Bristol riot charges prompts alarm over civil liberties,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/12/kill-the-bill-surge-in-bristol-riot-charges-prompts-alarm-over-civil-liberties
2/12/2022,"“So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.” It is one of the most memorable literary payoffs in history, the end of F Scott Fitzgerald’s defining novel of the 20th century, The Great Gatsby. Yet this famous ending will be lost to many readers thanks to the proliferation of substandard editions, one of which loses the last three pages and instead finishes tantalisingly halfway through a paragraph.  Experts are warning that the freedom for anyone to reproduce or reimagine books once they are out of copyright is corrupting classic texts – all for the sake of making a quick buck. The Great Gatsby of 1925 is the quintessential novel of the hedonistic jazz age, the story of the mysteriously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his love for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. It entered the public domain on 1 January 2021, after 95 years of copyright protection. Ernest Hemingway’s The Sun Also Rises, his 1926 novel about disillusioned expatriates in postwar France and Spain, came out of copyright protection last month. William Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury and John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath are among classics that will follow soon. Alarm over the poor-quality editions of The Great Gatsby has inspired a study by James West, general editor of the Cambridge Edition of the Works of F Scott Fitzgerald and emeritus professor of English at Pennsylvania State University. He said that Fitzgerald would have been “appalled” by inferior editions: “The composition of The Great Gatsby was his finest hour. It’s a delicate work of literature and you hate to see it treated so roughly.” In his study, to be published next month in the F Scott Fitzgerald Review, West contrasts the focus on accuracy of Fitzgerald’s publisher, Scribner, with today’s “textual instability incarnate”. He pored over 34 new print editions released in the past year, from established and independent publishers and some that list neither the place nor publisher, although there are further digital ones: “Six are competently done, but the rest are rather careless, done just to pick up a slice of the yearly sales. While it was still in copyright, Scribner’s sold about half a million copies a year, which is remarkable for a backlist title.” To his dismay, 17 editions dropped Fitzgerald’s dedication to his wife, Zelda: “Her name has been erased – a serious problem … because she was Fitzgerald’s muse. She was partly the inspiration for Daisy Buchanan.” One edition is instead dedicated to individuals that only its publisher would recognise: “Dedicated to Logan and Olivia Barbrook/ May your lives be filled with wonderful stories, great adventures and happily-ever-afters, Love Mummy.” The first edition’s cover – artist Francis Cugat’s painting of a woman’s eyes hovering over an amusement park – is “probably the most famous jacket in all of American literature”, West said, with Fitzgerald particularly wanting it, saying that he had “written it into the book”. It may have inspired details such as Doctor TJ Eckleburg’s “blue and gigantic” eyes. It appeared on the novel’s numerous reprints, but not on the new editions. West despairs over one cover with “a languid-looking woman” whose dress style was probably meant to suggest the novel’s 1920s setting, but is instead reminiscent of Aubrey Beardsley, who died in 1898. Another depicts a couple next to what resembles “a Dodge Charger, the muscle car popular during the 1980s”. West writes that its text is also “bizarre”. “Fitzgerald’s words appear to have been translated into another language and then rendered back into English by an antic computer.” One passage begins: “Anyway, Miss Baker’s lips frizzed …” Fitzgerald’s original reads: “At any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered.” Its final three pages are missing, even though the novel’s ending “drives home the meaning of the book”, West said. “Maybe they just ran out of pages.” Although The Great Gatsby went into the public domain in the UK in the early 1990s, the shoddy editions have emerged since the US copyright expired. Professor Kirk Curnutt, whose specialisms include Hemingway and Fitzgerald, said: “Any time a text goes into the public domain, there’s some anxiety about what’s going to happen. I don’t think the anxiety has been as intense as when The Great Gatsby went in. There are a lot of public domain editions of Gatsby that are just awful.” He believes that corrupt editions of The Beautiful and Damned, Fitzgerald’s 1922 novel about a couple awaiting an expected inheritance, have contributed to its “critical diminishment”. Several editions even got the title wrong, appearing as The Beautiful and the Damned, he despaired: “A pretty big mistake.” Asked how Hemingway would feel about such editions, Robert Trogdon, another scholar, said: “I don’t think he’d be pleased with new errors being introduced into his volumes. He was very upset with the changes that Jonathan Cape, his British publisher, made to his works for the sake of propriety.” Verna Kale, associate editor of the Hemingway Letters Project, said: “It can be good for a work to enter the public domain because it can actually give new life to a work that might have otherwise been lost. But works like Winnie-the-Pooh or The Sun Also Rises, works that are not at risk of obscurity, can actually be damaged by careless editing.”",Arts/Books,The Great Gapsby?

2/12/2022,"My mother was Armenian, my father Jewish. My father died when I was seven and my mother never remarried. She lived the rest of her 50 years for me. It’s the greatest thing that happened to me – I had a mother who dedicated her entire life to her only son. I grew up in Baku, Azerbaijan, in the deep south of the USSR. Everybody spoke Russian because it was an imperial city. At 10, I was sent to the Young Pioneer Palace in Baku to learn how to play chess. It didn’t take long for me to see the gap between reality and propaganda.  I was the first from my class to take a trip abroad, to France, when I was 13. Travelling was a big deal, even inside the Soviet Union. Travelling to other, capitalist countries was unheard of. Whether you spell Garry with a G or an H in Russian, you still pronounce it with a strong G. I was named after President Truman – Harry – whom my father admired for taking a strong stand against communism. It was a rare name in Russia, until Harry Potter came along. I stayed on top for 20 years because of my desire to be at the cutting edge – it was a never-ending process of exploration. This was my mother’s wisdom: as long as you challenge your own excellence, you’ll never be short of opponents. Was it painful to lose against [super-computer] Deep Blue? I’d never lost before, so I was furious. But 25 years later, I’d say it was a blessing. I became a pioneer. Though now more people know me as a consultant for The Queen’s Gambit than the man who lost to the IBM machine. The thing about jail that sticks in my memory is the sound when they lock the door. You understand you’re alone then, in a cage. I was lucky that I was arrested in what we now call the “vegetarian” times of Putin, when people ended up in jail for five or 10 days. For the same peaceful protest against Putin’s dictatorship, you might now end up in jail for five or 10 years. Running for president in 2007 was just a message. I was trying to demonstrate that the official Russian campaign was under the control of criminals. Putin is a dictator with blood on his hands. I’m retired, but I’m probably the strongest amateur chess player in the world. I still feel the responsibility. Chess gave me so much – global fame, publicity – and it helped me forge my character. Giving back to chess is somehow my duty. Chess still takes up about 25% of my time. I live in New York with my wife and two of my kids. For me, relaxation comes in shifting intellectual activities. My daughter, 15, has a great interest in literature – I help her with her debate topics. I’m doing a jigsaw with my six-year-old son: 600 pieces – a big one. When did I last cry? That’s easy: 25 December 2020, when my mother died. How Life Imitates Chess by Garry Kasparov is out now in paperback from Penguin.

2/12/2022," Being an Amazon delivery driver sure sounds like a blast: you get to see the world (well, part of it anyway) as you cruise the open road. Yes, the hours are gruelling. Yes, you sometimes have to pee in water bottles because there’s not enough time and no available facilities in which you can take a proper bathroom break. Yes, hauling heavy packages means you are at high risk of being injured on the job. Yes, creepy surveillance equipment tracks your every move. But you know what? You get the unparalleled satisfaction of knowing that your hard work is helping Jeff Bezos afford an obscenely large superyacht. And while the work may be difficult, there are also moments of joy: you get to jive on the job! According to Vice, TikTok users have started leaving notes in the Amazon app asking their delivery drivers to dance for their door cameras. Then these delightful people post the videos on social media. There are, I suppose, some delivery drivers who may enjoy being told to do a “chicken dance” as they drop off a package. But many of the drivers that Vice spoke to understandably found the dance requests demeaning and irritating. “I’ve only seen these requests in the app,” one driver from upstate New York said. “If they said it in person, I would probably smack the shit out of them.” And that driver would be justified: asking an Amazon worker to dance for your amusement is, to put it bluntly, deranged. It would appear that the PR suits at Amazon HQ would beg to differ. Amazon’s official TikTok account has been boosting the dystopic trend and sharing videos of delivery people dancing on command with cutesey little comments like “poppin’ and lockin’ while box droppin.’” It should be said, of course, that these drivers are not being forced to dance. It’s not as if Amazon is threatening anyone who ignores customers commands with 10 years of hard labour in Bezos’s space colonies. But there’s a thin line between officially requiring something of your workers and strongly incentivizing it. Amazon delivery drivers are tracked by AI-powered cameras and smartphone apps that monitor their behaviour and assign them a score at the end of the week. If you don’t behave exactly as Amazon dictates then you risk a low score and your livelihood is in jeopardy. Drivers are also rated by customers: too many bad reviews can get them fired. So it’s not exactly surprising that some drivers told Vice that they feel pressure to dance for the people who demand it. “Customer is king” is an age-old business mantra but thanks to new technology that king can very easily become a tyrant. Continuing the dystopian theme: Republicans in Oklahoma have introduced a bill to the state legislature that would create a call center for pregnant women who want “pre-abortion” resources. What does this mean? It means a bunch of ghouls (“care agents”) at the end of the phone pressuring vulnerable women into not getting an abortion. People who contact the center are also given a “unique identifying number” to be registered and tracked in a database run by the state department of health. Per the bill, you would only be able to get an abortion if an abortion provider can confirm you’ve been given one of these numbers. Republicans excel at weaponizing bureaucracy to control women. The extremist Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene must have missed the memo about her party trying to control citizens through government databases because she went on a Twitter rant this week about “Nancy Pelosi’s gazpacho police.” Speaking to the Guardian, the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld said he found the whole thing soup-er disturbing. “How in the world can a grown person, who grew up in the 20th century, not know what the word Gestapo is?” he asked. “They say ‘You can’t write this shit.’ It’s beyond you can’t write this shit.” It certainly is. Anyway, if you’ve ever felt like you’re not qualified enough to forge a career in politics just remember that there are people like Greene in power. More specifically it’s a picture of 25 pairs of bare breasts. The point of this? To highlight the diversity of women’s breasts, apparently. And, rather more obviously, to grab people’s attention. Everyone is talking about the advert now so job well done! Will it sell bras though? That is yet to be seen. It looks suspiciously like she did. It’s not clear why this is and experts are calling for more gender-specific research on the issue. One issue could be safety gear: Florida is the only state in the US, for example, which requires helmets for girls’ lacrosse even though they are standard for male players. This was a game-changer: a study found girls who played lacrosse in states that don’t require helmets had a 59% higher concussion rate. (As an aside, it’s funny to see Florida has no problem with certain safety mandates!) The overall gender pay gap has narrowed slightly however. Do spend a bit of time with this brilliant collection of essays. I especially enjoyed this beautifully written piece by Dr Frances Ryan: “It is radical to love a body that the world says is wrong.” And Arifa Akbar has a brilliant essay on compulsory motherhood: “A capitalism of the body and mind that packaged up maternal instinct and sold it back to me.” Yours truly has an article in the first edition, which just dropped.

A zoo in the UK hired a Marvin Gaye impersonator to serenade a group of endangered monkeys in the hopes that they’d “get it on” and keep their numbers up. “We thought it could be a creative way to encourage our females to show a little affection to males that might not have been so lucky in love,” park director Matt Lovatt said in a statement.

2/12/2022,"On this year’s best new artist Grammy award shortlist (the ceremony is in April), Brit-winning pop revelation Olivia Rodrigo is battling it out with Billie Eilish’s brother, Finneas, and rapper Saweetie, among others; Arlo Parks is in the mix too. Gatecrashing this none-more-mainstream party, however, is a little-known electronic composer and jazz conservatoire graduate who sings songs of longing in her native Urdu. Arooj Aftab’s spellbinding music defies easy categorisation. Jazz, ambient and traditional forms such as the ghazal – a Persian/Pakistani form of poetry – are components, rather than complete accounts, of Aftab’s work, which is full of ancient sadness and modern compositional rigour. The point of her work is not to promote orientalist readings of traditional Pakistani music. Aftab’s is as much a New York state of mind (her current home) as it is a south Asian one. Singer Jeff Buckley is a relevant reference point; Aftab covered his cover of Hallelujah as a teenager and it went viral in Pakistan. Buckley, of course, admired the great qawwali singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.  Only one of Aftab’s mesmerising songs is in English: Last Night, a translation of a Rumi poem that meditates on a lover’s beauty. On her haunting third album, Vulture Prince (2021), it features a reggae rhythm. When she sings it starkly tonight, accompanied only by double bass and harp, Aftab repeats the song’s central melancholy phrase: “Last night, my beloved was like the moon, so beautiful,” eyes narrowed, hands fluttering. Each time, she imbues it with a different intonation in her velvety, reverb-laden voice. It all ends with a metaphorical mic drop as Aftab, gathering volume, declares her lover to be: “More beautiful than … the sun.” The crowd whoop their approval. You can see Aftab is slightly taken aback by this avid reception on a cold Monday night in Leeds. This gig was scheduled to be seated, but having sold most of the tickets and still fielding inquiries, she and the promoter agreed to ditch the seats to increase capacity. Some engrossing modular synth compositions by the support act, Jake Mehew, add to the feeling of a great, rather than a hushed, night out. Aftab is by now probably used to upending expectations. She arrives on stage wearing a sleeveless silver coat, like a Doctor Who villain, sipping whisky; Scottish harpist Maeve Gilchrist sports a similar iridescent dress. For an artist whose latest album is suffused with the sadness at the loss of her brother and a close friend, Aftab is also very funny. Her new label, she says, got her a stylist. “So that’s why I’m dressed like a can opener.” That high-profile Grammy nod is just the latest in a list of recent firsts for an artist who moved from Lahore to Boston aged 19 to study music and has since stationed herself in Brooklyn. Time magazine praised Aftab for releasing one of the best songs of 2021, Mohabbat, last spring; former US president Barack Obama put the track (also up for its own Grammy) on his influential summer playlist. Vulture Prince featured on a plethora of end-of-year charts. All of these events, she told an interviewer from Berklee College of Music (her alma mater), virtually melted her social media accounts when they happened, catapulting this previously niche artist into widespread renown. She’s now signed to jazz powerhouse label Verve, once home to names such as Nina Simone. So Billie Eilish has a fragrance? Aftab’s Bandcamp merchandise included (it has long since sold out) a Vulture Prince scent designed by an Egyptian Canadian perfumier to her specifications: “90s Lahore, huge oak trees, seasonal fruit, fire worship, empty space, [Prince’s] Purple Rain.” Tonight’s set – bar the encore – comes exclusively from Vulture Prince, a multilayered record replete with guitar, violin and flugelhorn that, despite the language barrier, seems to speak directly to anyone in any kind of pain. All the tracks have been reworked for Gilchrist’s harp and the double bass of Greek musician Petros Klampanis, a pared-down rendering that nonetheless packs an intoxicating punch. The most jazz thing about this setup is how Aftab encourages the players to extemporise – this is, in essence, a three-way conversation in which the sublime is summoned through multiple channels. On the extraordinary Suroor (Felicitation), Gilchrist plays what can only be described as a mean funk harp; at one point, both she and Klampanis percuss the bodies of their instruments. “It’s rude, how good they are,” notes Aftab of her musicians. “This will be the banger off the record,” she announces wryly as the set nears its end. The lighting tech turns some brights on to the spinning disco ball to howls of appreciation. This is, of course, Mohabbat (Love), the gateway drug for the album, and home to some of Aftab’s most elegiac intonations. The song concludes on a restrained shimmer of harp and the beat of one bass note, and Aftab’s voice – redolent of the cool of evening, but also of overwhelming emotion just kept at bay.",Arts/Music,Arooj Aftab review – a mesmerising ambient jazz threesome,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/12/arooj-aftab-review-mesmerising-jazz-threesome-brudenell-social-club-leeds-vulture-prince-maeve-gilchrist-petros-klampanis
2/12/2022,"A hospital patient in Bedfordshire has died from a confirmed case of Lassa fever – the third case to be identified in the UK in the past few days. All three cases of the potentially fatal disease are understood to be linked to recent travel to West Africa.  But where did the virus originate from, what are the symptoms and how transmissible is it? Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness, belonging to the virus family Arenaviridae, that lasts between two and 21 days, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The virus, for which there is no approved vaccine, is known to be endemic in Benin, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. But it also probably exists in other West African countries as well. After starting as a fever with aches and pains, the symptoms can progress to headache, vomiting and diarrhoea. Severe cases can cause victims to bleed from the mouth and nose. Humans can contract Lassa fever from eating food that has been tainted by the urine or faeces of rodents. The virus, like Ebola, can also be spread through contact with the body fluids of a sick person, but it does not spread easily between humans. According to the WHO, there is no epidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread from person to person. Most people with Lassa fever will make a full recovery although severe illness can occur. The overall case-fatality rate is 1%, according to the WHO. But the observed case-fatality rate among patients who are admitted to hospital with severe cases of Lassa fever is 15%. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival chances. The virus was first formally identified in Nigeria in 1969 and no cases were reported in the UK until the 1980s. Since then, there have been 11 confirmed cases in total, including the three cases identified in the last few days. These cases are the first to have been confirmed in the UK since 2009. In November 2019, three British nationals were brought back to the UK from Sierra Leone for medical assessment after coming into close contact with two people diagnosed with Lassa fever. However, no Lassa fever cases were ultimately confirmed. Four people have now died from the virus in the UK since 2000, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) told PA. One died in 2000, two died in 2009 and the fourth death was confirmed on Friday. Two cases of the virus were discovered in the east of England on Wednesday. A third was confirmed on Friday in a Bedfordshire hospital but the patient died. The UKHSA said the risk to the public “remains very low”.",News/Science,Lassa fever: What are the symptoms and is it easy to catch?,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/12/lassa-fever-what-are-the-symptoms-and-is-it-easy-to-catch
2/12/2022,"A “wonderful” three-year-old boy has died in hospital almost a week after a crash on a motorway in Wales that also killed a four-year-old girl. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had been travelling in a car on the M4 westbound carriageway, near Newport, when it was hit by a van on 5 February.  There was a huge emergency services response and the road was closed for about seven hours last week. The boy’s family said he died on Friday at 4.30pm after almost a week of being treated in the intensive care unit at University Hospital of Wales, also known as the Heath hospital, in Cardiff. A family member told the PA news agency: “Unfortunately, after a week of fighting, he has passed away. He was wonderful, creative and a kind soul. Turned the grey skies blue.” Four-year-old Gracie-Ann Wheaton, from Tredegar, was also severely injured in the crash and died the following day. Gracie-Ann had been returning home from a birthday party, her cousin Jamie Lucas, said. Lucas, 19, paid tribute to Gracie-Ann, describing her as “just fantastic to be around”. He said: “I’m just trying to wrap my head around the fact that she’s gone; it’s hard to believe. “She was so young. She had a bright future ahead of her. She was such a wonderful child. I’m just lost for words really. How she was returning from a birthday party and all of a sudden she’s gone,” he said. “She was very smart, she was very creative. She had a really great imagination as well. She was just fantastic to be around.” The van driver, 41-year-old Martin Newman, of Croeserw, appeared at Newport magistrates court on Monday charged with causing death by dangerous driving and two offences of causing serious injury by dangerous driving in relation to the accident.

2/12/2022,"One of the common anxieties of football’s age of billionaire owners and nation state PR projects is the fear that clubs will lose their long-standing identities, that they will become instead plasticised entertainment vehicles, anonymous machines for winning. Although not quite yet, it seems. Relax for a moment. Kick back. And take a long cool drink of the mixed and flowing substance that remains forever Spurs. There was at least something reassuringly familiar about the collapse at home to Southampton on Wednesday night. Tottenham Hotspur may have the greatest new-build ground in Europe. They may have an A-list manager in his mid-career prime. They may have in Harry Kane – and bear with this – the outstanding Premier League attacker of the last eight years. But the ability to shift effortlessly between fluent attack and showing all the defensive resilience of a beaded curtain remains intact.  The worst part of that home defeat wasn’t the fact Tottenham were 2-1 up with 10 minutes to play, then lost the game 3-2. The inept defending for both late goals wasn’t the worst part either. The worst part was Antonio Conte being nice afterwards. This is the same Conte who seems to generate his own ambient energy field with those fits of performative rage; for whom that gorgeously lush auburn hair transplant was probably written off as a necessary business expense, such is the importance to his professional wellbeing of the tousled and passionate mediaeval warrior king persona. The Italian was instead muted and conciliatory in defeat. He talked about the need to protect his players’ confidence. He said: “This is our life now.” And the reference to the present tense seems telling. Conte is being careful, in public at least. Southampton at home may have revealed the fragility of key parts of this team, but it was also the start of a run of five Premier League matches in 18 days that will decide the trajectory of Tottenham’s season. This is where they catch up on the fixture list. Four points off fourth with three games in hand is still a position of strength. The same run of games could also end up deciding the future of a player who looks increasingly like an unsustainable anomaly in this team. There has been a suggestion this week that Kane has warmed a little towards the idea of extending his contract at Spurs. Much will depend on how skewed that balance looks by the end of March, the gulf in quality between the squad’s base level and its outstanding player. To put this in context, Tottenham have signed just two first-team-ready central defenders since the summer of 2015 (both played – badly – in midweek). Their full-back stocks have declined from the heights of Kyle Walker and Kieran Trippier divvying up the right flank, to Emerson, Matt Doherty and Japhet Tanganga being rotated hopefully like a set of misaligned tyres. Kane hasn’t had a regular supplier of goalscoring passes since Christian Eriksen left.And somehow through that same period this declining team have managed to hang on to the best Premier League centre forward of his era. Kane has now scored more Premier League goals and more England goals without actually winning a single career trophy than any other player. He turns 29 in the summer. This is getting a little uncomfortable. At which point it is necessary to re-state just how good Kane is. It has become habit for those confused by team trophies, glitz, and a cinematic highlights reel, to say that Kane is an overrated footballer. If anything the opposite is true. Kane is underrated, his scoring feats taken for granted, his deeper gears, his supreme all-round game under-praised. He now has exactly 300 career goals: 236 for spurs, 16 for Millwall, Orient and Leicester City and 48 for England, with 43 in his last 50 internationals. Scroll down the Premier League list and only Sergio Agüero and Thierry Henry have a better goals-per-game record among those to reach one hundred. The difference being, both played in sublime teams surrounded by brilliant footballers. Whereas Kane has only ever played regularly for those notorious flakes and flunkers England and Spurs, teams that are to some extent defined by their lack of success. His entire first-team career has been spent without an adequate back-up striker, so he has been out there twanging his ankle, rushing back, carrying that burden alone. His record swimming against that tide is extraordinary. Even this season, which has seen two brand new managers and Kane either distracted by the summer’s drama or roving weirdly around the pitch, he has still somehow crept up to 21 goals, most of them sneaky, box-ticking filler against tadpole opposition, but classic Numbers Man stuff for that. This is the other issue Kane must wrestle with. His own tactical development of the last few years is becoming a problem. The tendency to drop into the No 10 role, to roam as a 360-degree playmaker, has confirmed that he can also moonlight as Spurs’ best midfield passer. No great shakesin itself. But it is also a bit like using an artisan Japanese steak knife to grout the kitchen floor. Conte has tried to reposition his best goalscorer as a cutting edge. “At the moment with us he is playing much more like a No 9,” he said after the win at Leicester, where Kane did play further forward and racked up 10 shots, a goal and an assist. But it is a vice that returns in moments of doubt, something Kane does when nothing is coming through the midfield. So Kane drops back to create because he’s better at doing this than anyone behind him. It works at times. Against Brighton in the FA Cup he scored twice while still playing nine long forward passes from those deep pockets. But it has also become a sign of a clog in the works, as it was against Southampton where the midfield simply collapsed after half-time. Kane should be playing in front of midfielders who make him look good, save his legs and expand his own game, not twirling about in a space more authoritative teammates would insist he vacated. It is similar to what Lionel Messi ended up doing at Barcelona, filling holes, patching up his team on the go, delaying the necessary structural work. Conte has tried to rebalance this weakness by bringing in a greater depth of passing quality in the January window. The next six weeks will test how well he can finesse these adjustments on the hoof, and how successfully Kane can clarify his own role. For all the horrors of that defensive display in midweek Spurs still have a manager who has won this league and a central striker with the chops to get them into the top four. “I am super happy,” Kane announced at the turn of the year. Wolves at home on Sunday is the next stage in a run that will test exactly how deep those feelings run.",Sport/Football,Harry Kane single-handedly offers glimmer of light amid gloom at Spurs | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/12/harry-kane-single-handedly-offers-glimmer-of-light-amid-gloom-at-spurs
