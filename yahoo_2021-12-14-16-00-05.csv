12/14/2021,"By Humeyra Pamuk, Michael Martina and David Brunnstrom WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A video feed of a Taiwanese minister was cut during U.S. President Joe Biden's Summit for Democracy last week after a map in her slide presentation showed Taiwan in a different color to China, which claims the island as its own. Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Friday's slide show by Taiwanese Digital Minister Audrey Tang caused consternation among U.S. officials after the map appeared in her video feed for about a minute. The sources, who did not want to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter, said the video feed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw2bfsjTXhA showing Tang was cut during a panel discussion and replaced with audio only - at the behest of the White House. The White House was concerned that differentiating Taiwan and China on a map in a U.S.-hosted conference - to which Taiwan had been invited in a show of support at a time when it is under intense pressure from Beijing - could be seen as being at odds with Washington's ""one-China"" policy, which avoids taking a position as to whether Taiwan is part of China, the sources said. The State Department said ""confusion"" over screen-sharing resulted in Tang's video feed being dropped, calling it ""an honest mistake."" ""We valued Minister Tang's participation, which showcased Taiwan's world-class expertise on issues of transparent governance, human rights, and countering disinformation,"" a spokesperson said. Tang's presentation included a color-coded map from South African NGO CIVICUS, ranking the world by openness on civil rights. Most of Asia was shown, with Taiwan colored green, making it the only regional entity portrayed as ""open,"" while all the others, including several U.S. allies and partners, were labeled as being ""closed,"" ""repressed,"" ""obstructed"" or ""narrowed."" China, Laos, Vietnam and North Korea were colored red and labeled ""closed."" When the moderator returned to Tang a few minutes later, there was no video of her, just audio, and a screenshot captioned: ""Minister Audrey Tang Taiwan."" An onscreen disclaimer later declared: ""Any opinions expressed by individuals on this panel are those of the individual, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the United States government."" One source told Reuters the map generated an instant email flurry among U.S. officials and the White House National Security Council (NSC) angrily contacted the State Department, concerned it appeared to show Taiwan as a distinct country. Washington complained to Taiwan's government, which in turn was angry that Tang's video had been cut. The source called the U.S. move an over-reaction as the map was not inherently about national boundaries, but the NSC was also angry as the slide had not appeared in ""dry-run"" versions of the presentation before the summit, raising questions as to whether there was intentional messaging by Tang and Taiwan. ""They choked,"" the source said of the White House reaction. A second source directly involved in the summit said the video booth operator acted on White House instructions. ""It was clearly policy concerns,"" the source said, adding: ""This was completely an internal overreaction."" The sources saw the move during a panel on ""countering digital authoritarianism"" as at odds with the summit's mission of bolstering democracy in the face of challenges from China and others. They also said it could signal that the administration's support for Taiwan was not as ""rock solid"" as it has repeatedly stated. An NSC spokesman said Reuters' account of the incident was ""inaccurate"". ""At no time did the White House direct that Minister Tang's video feed be cut,"" the spokesman said in an email, also blaming it on confusion over screen-sharing and adding that the full video could be viewed on the summit web page. Asked whether she believed the U.S. government cut the video due to the slide, Tang told Reuters in an email: ""No, I do not believe that this has anything to do with the CIVICUS map in my slides, or U.S. allies in Asia for that matter."" Taiwan's foreign ministry blamed ""technical problems."" It later said Tang's presentation had been provided in advance and not shown at the last minute. ""Taiwan and the United States have fully communicated on this technical issue, and the two sides have a solid mutual trust and a solid and friendly relationship,"" it said. The issue comes at a highly sensitive time for U.S.-Taiwan relations, when some Biden administration critics and foreign policy experts are calling for more overt shows of support for the island, including an end to a long-held policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" as to whether the United States would defend it militarily. Taiwan experts said they did not see the color-coding of the map as a violation of unofficial U.S. guidelines, which bar use of overt symbols of sovereignty, such as Taiwan's flag. ""It was clearly not to distinguish sovereignty, but the degree of democratic expression,"" said Douglas Paal, a former unofficial U.S. ambassador to Taiwan. Under U.S. government guidelines https://hiu.state.gov/cartographic_guidance_bulletins/37-Taiwan-2020.pdf as of 2020, U.S. government maps showing sovereignty by color require Taiwan to be shown with the same color as China, although exceptions can be made ""when context requires that Taiwan be specifically singled out."" Bonnie Glaser of the German Marshall Fund of the United States said the guidelines would not apply to a non-U.S. government map, ""but the U.S. would likely want to avoid appearing to endorse that Taiwan is not part of China."" ""It seems to me that a decision was made at the outset that Taiwan could/should be included in the Summit for Democracy, but only in ways consistent with U.S. policy.""

12/14/2021,"Pro fighter Conor McGregor said on social media he's packed on muscle after an injury in July. After six months of free weights and a strict diet, McGregor said he now weighs 190 pounds. For most people, gaining that much muscle that quickly is unrealistic. Experts say a slow, steady pace is best. UFC fighter Conor McGregor has been bulking up, according to his social media. Following a shocking mid-fight injury in July, McGregor posted he's now up to 190 pounds from his fighting weight of 156 pounds. He told Spanish outlet AS that the transformation is due to plenty of hypertrophy training, free weights, and six meals a day of carefully-measured carbs, fat, and protein. It's not the first time McGregor has dramatically shifted the scales; he previously packed on enough mass to compete in multiple weight classes in UFC. If you're not a pro fighter, though, it's more likely you'll see modest gains after six months. Even if your diet and exercise is on point, a pound or two of gains per month is more realistic, research shows. Experts say a slow and steady approach is a better bet for maximum muscle gains. Building muscle doesn't happen overnight. It takes years for athletes and fitness models to build their physiques. It is possible to see results of muscle-building efforts within a few months, according to research. A typical beginner to training might be able to gain four to seven pounds of fat-free mass (including muscle) in two to three months, according to research summarized by Strengthlog. More experienced athletes will gain muscle more slowly — two to four pounds within the same time period would be realistic, data suggests. As a result, reasonable estimates for six months might be anywhere from four to 14 pounds of muscle gain, depending on training experience, age, current body size, and genetics, as well as your workout and diet plan. To build any kind of muscle, regardless of fitness level, you also need to be sure to maintain a calorie surplus and get the right combination of nutrients. For those of us who aren't professional athletes, it's important to be realistic about your goals, since muscle-building is unlikely to be your full-time job. Unless you can hire an expert team dedicated to supporting your nutrition and fitness, you're not likely to have the ideal circumstances for gains. The good news is, you don't have to. You can see muscle gains in as few as 10 sets of exercise per body part per week, according to research. You may also have a slight advantage of being able to make major improvements to muscle and strength more quickly than experienced athletes, a phenomenon known as ""newbie gains."" Regardless, it's important to not be discouraged by a perceived lack of progress, and comparing yourself to celebrities isn't helpful. Instead, focus on maintaining good habits, and tracking small, consistent improvements to performance as well as aesthetics, experts say. ""It can take months to put on muscle but benefits in strength happen quickly,"" Noam Tamir, founder and CEO of TS Fitness in New York City, previously told Insider.
