3/2/2022,"Six days after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, there is mounting evidence that its military is committing war crimes with deadly attacks on civilians and the use of cluster munitions. Eliot Higgins, the founder of the investigative journalism site Bellingcat, said there was evidence of Russia causing “civilian harm”, including through the use of “cluster bombs in civilian areas”, from credible video and stills of the conflict. Footage of an attack on a car park in Kharkiv on Monday, described by a Bellingcat researcher as a cluster bomb strike, shows residents walking in a nearby park just as the sequence of bombs go off. The area appears to be residential. Dashcam footage, assessed by Russia’s Conflict Intelligence Team to have been shot in Kharkiv, is thought to show a cluster bomb landing in a road last Friday. The driver makes a hasty U-turn as explosions rain around the car. Given the lack of aircraft noise, the bomb was probably fired by a Russian Grad rocket system, the researchers conclude. Cluster munitions, which indiscriminately scatter small bombs over a wide area, are banned by more than 100 states including the UK, France and Germany because of their lack of precision. But neither Russia nor Ukraine (or the US) have signed up to a treaty first introduced in 2008 that bans them. Further evidence of the use of cluster munitions has emerged, including the remains of a rocket motor from a BMP-30 Russian cluster munition found in road in Kharkiv on Friday, and video of a similar bomb part landing in Bucha, north-west of Kyiv. Several NGOs have focused on an attack on a kindergarten in Okhtyrka, about 60 miles west of Kharkiv, on Friday, the second day of all-out fighting. Drone footage taken in the aftermath shows multiple blackened explosion spots, and dead or severely injured people by the entrance. Three civilians were killed, including a child, said Amnesty International. “There is no possible justification for dropping cluster munitions in populated areas, let alone near a school,” said Agnès Callamard, the secretary general of Amnesty International. Intentionally targeting civilians or civilian buildings is considered a war crime under international humanitarian law, as are attacks on military targets that cause excessive civilian casualties, according to the United Nations. Russia routinely denies it engages in illegal attacks. Roos Boer, a project leader with the Pax peace project in the Netherlands, said: “If you are in doubt whether a target is military or not, you should presume it is civilian. An indiscriminate attack therefore is unlawful.” Video evidence suggests Russian missile strikes on the eastern city of Kharkiv were launched with little regard for the impact on civilians. A missile strike on Tuesday – possibly a Kalibr cruise missile – on the regional government building in the centre of Kharkiv was filmed as it happened. At least 10 civilians were killed in the morning attack in the heart of the industrial city of more than 1 million people. Hours later, Russia said it would engage in what it called “high-precision” strikes on official buildings in Kyiv. On Monday videos showed serial explosions from multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) on other buildings in Kharkiv. One showed the distinctive 13-storey Diamond City tower clearly visible in the foreground. Bomb fragments were seen in roads in Kharkiv and rocket parts in apartments and dead civilians on the streets on a day where at least nine were killed. But despite concerns raised by western intelligence, clear evidence is yet to emerge of Russian forces using destructive thermobaric weapons (although Ukraine has claimed capture of a TOS-1A flamethrower) or cluster incendiary bombs of the type that its forces were accused of using in Syria during the siege of Aleppo. On Monday night one western official said there was “a requirement to record and capture” attacks on civilians, while another said: “I think we will be very attentive and alert to war crimes or breaches of international humanitarian law in this conflict.” But while governments talk about acting, researchers are already playing their part. Higgins said that unlike in other recent conflicts – such as the war in Syria – “an open-source intelligence community” collecting and studying video and photo evidence had emerged “from day one”. Aided by the willingness of Ukrainians and others to document the conflict on their phones, independent researchers such as Bellingcat have been able to quickly geolocate and document evidence that could be useful in the future. Bellingcat has also set up a partnership with Mnemonic, an NGO dedicated to archiving evidence collected from social media and mobile phones, which aims to secure material to the standard of evidence. “The day may come when all this ends up at the international criminal court,” Higgins said.",News/World news,Researchers gather evidence of possible Russian war crimes in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/researchers-gather-evidence-of-possible-russian-war-crimes-in-ukraine
3/2/2022,"When Adam Bailey last sought insurance for his antiques shop in Lismore, nobody would offer cover except one firm that demanded $70,000 a year. The shop with its 150 year-old Japanese kites and rare jewellery was “like a museum” but Bailey and his other neighbours balked at paying out such premiums. After this week’s flood topped previous flood heights by 2 metres, Bailey is facing half a million dollars of uninsured losses. “It’s still under water,” Bailey said on Wednesday, still unable to visit the shop. “We’re used to floods but nobody can deal with this,” he added. “I struggle to believe Lismore will survive this one.” Insurers are in the early stages of assessing the insured damages from the ongoing floods in northern New South Wales and Queensland. On Wednesday, the “rain bomb” looked set to include regions in and around Sydney. The insurance industry continues to count the cost of this week’s ongoing floods, with more damage expected in the central NSW region and Sydney. As of Wednesday, claims had reached 48,220, up by half in a day. The latest weather-related catastrophe reveals the scope of the perils Australia faces, particularly for residents in vulnerable communities like Lismore, insurance and climate experts said. While insurers are demanding more money be spent on boosting the resilience of communities to a heating climate, in some cases the response should be to encourage people to live elsewhere, they said. “As the climate changes, and the weather becomes more extreme, I think we’ll have to accept that in some places you just can’t treat the risk [by adaptation],” said Tom Davies, an insurance consultant who helped lead the Insurance Council of Australia’s climate strategy until December. “We’ll have to retreat.” The industry last month released its resilience report, appealing for the federal government to double annual spending to $200m to mitigate against disasters, and for states to match the increase. The money would go on building levees, strengthening bridges and other projects to limit damage, saving on recovery costs and keeping insurance premiums lower in the process. Davies, who co-founded consultancy Edge Environment, said authorities need to update building and planning codes that were developed for a stable climate that no longer existed as extremes worsen on a warming planet. Premiums would rise in many vulnerable communities, prompting more people to ditch insurance. “We can’t keep on putting houses in an area that’s set to a one-on-100 year flood height,” Davies said. He cited the Hawkesbury-Nepean floodplain to Sydney’s north and west, a region known to be flood prone but where planners continue to allow new housing developments. “You’ve got to stop putting homes in harm’s way … which is difficult because in particular, there’s a lot of pressure on land [development as] we need more homes,” Davies said. The director of the Australian Research Council’s centre of excellence for climate Extremes, Andy Pitman, said Australian settlements – along with many other places – were built close to rivers or the coast, or both, leaving them exposed to intense weather events. “If you think about where risk is magnified, it’s exactly those places,” he said. “So an awful lot of our settlements around the world are actually designed to be close to the things that bring the risk, which is awkward, really.” Pitman said insurance companies typically don’t insure against events that they know will occur. “They’re in the business of gambling,” he added. “They gamble that you’ll pay your premium and that they won’t pay out.” The climate crisis, though, was “weighting the odds” in ways that would discourage insurers from offering cover for certain events, particularly flooding and cyclone-related damage. In a bid to stem the exit of insurers from northern Australia, the Morrison government last month said it had finished the design of a $10bn reinsurance pool that will begin operations in July. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning More than 880,000 residential, strata and small business property owners are forecast to get premium discounts of as much as 58%, saving almost $3bn over 1o years, the government said. Insurers welcomed the move even as they predicted perils will increase. “Our research and data tell us that we’re going to see more intense extreme weather events, particularly in northern Australia, and the Cyclone Reinsurance Pool will play an important role in helping to prepare and protect people and communities,” said Nick Hawkins, IAG’s managing director and chief executive. However a senior adviser to the government, who requested anonymity, said a similar intervention in the US to fill an insurance void in hurricane-threatened areas ended up leaving billions of dollars of debt for the government. People were also encouraged to add rather than reduce their exposure to the threats. “It’s the opposite signal that you want to end up sending,” the adviser said. Davies agreed “they’re basically weakening the signal of an insurance premium”, while Pitman said insurers were better equipped than governments to assess perils. “Insurance companies deeply understand risk because their viability depends on that, and governments don’t,” Pitman said. “It’s very dangerous.” Governments might also be tempted to intervene to support communities such as Lismore, but the town’s levee was built only to withstand a one-in-10 year flood, and even that flood level was based on historical records. Any levee that would protect Lismore against one-in-a-century floods “was like putting the Berlin Wall through the city [which] was completely untenable to the people who live there”, Pitman said. Managing director of Risk Frontiers, Andrew Gissing, said the Wilsons River flood has a 0.2% chance in any year, a calculation usually expressed as a one-in-500-year event. S&P Global Ratings put an early estimate of the extreme flooding as a $1bn-plus insurance event.“This exposure could increase to $2b with ongoing Brisbane River inundation in urban areas and as the storm cell moves further into NSW,” S&P said. “This would place the insurance exposure alongside that of Australia’s largest flood events.” The January 2011 floods in Brisbane cost a normalised $2.1b, while the city’s 1974 floods is put at $3.2b.

3/2/2022,"In his small store in Mount Isa, almost 2,000km from the flood zones, grocer Joe da Silva is struggling to fill his shelves. His fresh produce is gone. Stocks of other basics are dwindling. And there’s no certainty about when the next truck will arrive. “If nothing comes, I have nothing to sell,” he tells the Guardian. Da Silva, who runs Mount Isa’s Foodworks, is far from the hardest hit by the crippling grocery shortages that followed the rising waters across south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales. But his situation is an indication of just how devastating the floods have been to the state’s supply chains. It also shows the fragility of a system still deeply reliant on key transport links to the south-east. “It’s difficult because we are so isolated from everything … so the moment that there are floods, or fires, or any disaster occurs on the coast, we are the first ones who feel it up here,” he said. The shortages continue to be most dire in towns and suburbs directly affected by the floods. Coles and Woolworths have closed hundreds of stores between them at some point during the disaster. Coles still had eight stores shut on Wednesday, with limited hours at others. For those supermarkets that were still open, stocks were dwindling and shelves were reported to be increasingly bare. In actions that mirrored the worst periods of the pandemic, both companies introduced purchase limits for customers. Coles and Woolworths both introduced two-pack purchase limits in affected regions, including fresh milk, meat and medicine, and one-pack limits on toilet paper and still water. Woolworths expanded its limit to the entire state on Wednesday and executed contingency plans to try to use alternative inland distribution lines to circumvent floodwaters and road closures and get as much stock as possible into affected regions. That included re-rerouting deliveries into Queensland from South Australia, and supplying northern Queensland from the state’s centre, via Emerald. “As floods continue to ravage the east coast, critical supply lines into northern NSW and throughout Queensland have been impacted by road closures, limiting how quickly we can get stock into flood-affected regions,” Woolworths director of stores, Jeanette Fenske, said. Evacuees, in particular, were facing acute challenges getting food. In Lismore, police had to coordinate a helicopter food drop to about 300 flood evacuees sheltering at a church in Coraki. Coraki resident Rudi Maxwell, who is sleeping in her car at the church evacuation centre with her dogs, said the evacuees have food but their supply is running low. “They are aware that food is needed here, so they are loading up the helicopter and sending it over from Casino shortly,” Maxwell said. “They have been really good at getting everyone fed and we have running water and it’s so hard to tell how many people are here, it’s so chaotic, a lot of us camping out in our cars. There may be upwards of 300 people and about that many cars as well.” The floods have cut off Australia’s busiest highway, the Pacific Highway, and left trucks stranded, with all local freight ceasing until the waters recede. The problem is compounded by the disruption to rail links and the derailment of a freight train near Gympie, and the flooding of warehouses. Coles said it was trying to keep as many stores open and stocked as possible, but faced significant difficulties. “We are working hard with our transport and supplier partners to reroute deliveries affected by road closures and ensure we can regularly maintain deliveries of essential groceries over the coming days,” a spokesperson said. In Longreach in central Queensland, well out of reach of the flood waters, some grocery stores have had to shut entirely. The Longreach Fruit Barn shut its doors on Tuesday, because it barely had any fresh produce to sell. That in turn created a knock-on effect for other local businesses, who use it as their source of fresh produce. Fruit Barn’s owner, Sam Tweedale, was staying positive on Wednesday, despite the significant financial hit he was taking. “Given that the region has been in drought for a long time, they just understand that these weather events are what they are and there’s no point really complaining about it,” he told the Guardian. “You can’t change it, I guess, at the end of the day.” Both Tweedale and the local Foodworks, run by Rose and Lloyd Leggett, say new deliveries are expected to arrive later this week. Rose Leggett said Longreach had, thankfully, avoided the kind of panic buying seen in cities during the pandemic. “People are very sensible. You can rely on them to be pretty sensible about things,” she told the Guardian. “Most people realise that you’ve just got to poke along and be a bit steady and not overdo anything. If everyone panics and you sell out of everything, well then everyone goes without until the trucks get here.” Earlier this week, Stephen Bartos, who authored a 2012 report examining resilience in Australia’s food chains, said connections to north Queensland had improved since the 2010-11 floods, but that the state’s south remained very vulnerable to being cut off because it was built on a flood plain. “We need more duplication of supply lines like rail lines and roads, and we need to consider shorter supply chains and more local sources,” Bartos said.",News/Australia news,‘Nothing to sell’: Queensland and NSW flood waters hit supermarkets and grocery supplies,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/02/nothing-to-sell-queensland-and-nsw-flood-waters-hit-supermarket-grocery-supplies
