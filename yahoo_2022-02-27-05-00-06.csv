2/27/2022,"Germany is sending 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger missiles to Ukraine. The announcement marks a reversal of restrictive policies in Germany that prohibited sending arms to conflict areas. ""The Russian attack marks a turning point,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Saturday. Germany is planning to send 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger missiles to Ukraine, according to a statement made by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Saturday. ""The Russian attack marks a turning point,"" Scholz wrote in a statement shared on Twitter. ""It is our duty to do our best to help Ukraine defend against the invading army of Putin. That's why we're supplying 1000 anti-tank weapons and 500 stinger missiles to our friends in Ukraine."" The announcement marks a significant shift of Germany's restrictive arms export policy. The country has previously said it held ""historical responsibilities"" that prevented it from sending weapons and arms to conflict areas, often citing guilt for crimes committed against the Soviet Union during World War II. As part of the new stance, Germany is also lifting restrictions it previously held among NATO allies that prohibited sending German-based arms to conflict areas. This will allow countries like the Netherlands to ship 400 rocket-propelled grenades to Ukraine, Axios reported. Ukranian officials and leaders in allied countries banned from sending arms expressed frustration over the strict policies in recent weeks, heading into Russia's attack against Ukraine on Thursday. The reversal comes as Russian forces continue their advance into the Ukranian capital of Kyiv, where the mayor announced a strict curfew on Friday. The decision could also foster wider support from the European Union, particularly given Germany's vast economic power and stature. The country also holds a large percentage of the continent's arms and ammunition, according to Politico.

2/27/2022,"China's Foreign Ministry on Friday stressed that Beijing believes the ""sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries"" should be respected — a principle that ""applies equally to Ukraine."" Why it matters: Reiterating that Russia's ""legitimate security demands"" on NATO expansion ""should be taken seriously and properly addressed,"" the statement marks China's most extensive one yet on Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free The big picture: Weeks before the attack began, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin issued an unprecedented joint statement seeming to align their visions for an anti-Western international order. The two authoritarian powers have fostered deeper ties, including in military cooperation, as tensions with the U.S. have soared over the past several years — raising major alarms in Washington. Russia and China said they ""oppose further enlargement of NATO"" and called on the West ""to abandon its ideologized cold war approaches."" Driving the news: Following a call with his British, EU and French counterparts, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi outlined Beijing's position on Ukraine in five points: China ""firmly advocates"" abiding by the UN Charter and respecting the territorial integrity of all countries, including Ukraine. The security of one country cannot be strengthened at the expense of another, and Russia is justified to have concerns about five rounds of NATO expansion. China believes ""all parties"" should exercise restraint and protect civilian life and property to prevent a large-scale humanitarian crisis. China supports ""direct dialogue and negotiation between Russia and Ukraine as soon as possible"" and believes Ukraine ""should be a bridge between East and West, not a frontier of great power confrontation."" The UN Security Council should be used to ""facilitate a diplomatic solution"" and ""cool tensions rather than fuel them."" China has always opposed UN resolutions that invoke Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which authorizes military and non-military steps to ""restore international peace and security."" Between the lines: The New York Times reported Friday that U.S. officials tried half a dozen times over three months to get China to help head off a Russian invasion of Ukraine, but that Beijing did not believe the warnings and even shared the information with Moscow. What to watch: With major Western sanctions set to isolate Russia from much of the global economy, many experts believe the Kremlin's dependence on China will dramatically increase.

2/27/2022,"STORY: Russian forces pounded Ukrainian cities for a third day on Saturday (February 26) with artillery and cruise missiles. But President Zelenskiy said the capital Kyiv remained in Ukrainian hands, despite Russian forces only 30km away. Kyiv's mayor warned saboteur groups were active in the capital, which is home to three million people. The nighttime curfew has also been extended. While the metro system is now serving only as an air raid shelter, hundreds of thousands have fled westwards. 100,000 refugees have crossed into Poland alone. Ukraine has prevented all men aged between 18-60 from leaving the country so they can fight. Almost 200 Ukrainians have been killed and over 1,000 injured. Ukraine has said more than 1,000 Russian soldiers had been killed, but no official Russian casualty figures have been released. The Kremlin said Putin had ordered troops to stop advancing on Friday (February 25) but that they were moving forwards on Saturday after Kyiv refused to negotiate. Ukraine has denied it is refusing to negotiate. Russia's Defence Ministry said its forces had captured Melitopol, a city of 150,000 in southeastern Ukraine. Britain has cast doubt on the report. If confirmed, it would be the first significant population center the Russians have seized. On Friday, Russia vetoed a draft U.N. Security Council resolution that would have condemned Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. China abstained from the vote. Putin has said he must eliminate what he calls a serious threat to his country from its smaller neighbor and has cited the need to ""denazify"" Ukraine's leadership, accusing it of genocide against Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine. A charge dismissed by Kyiv and its Western allies as baseless propaganda.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Russian forces pound Ukraine for third day,https://news.yahoo.com/russian-forces-pound-ukraine-third-180722944.html
