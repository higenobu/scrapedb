2/28/2022,"Eddie Jones has said England fear nobody in the Six Nations title race, insisting his side are in charge of their own destiny. Victory against Wales on Saturday keeps them in the hunt for the championship and, though sterner tests await against Ireland and France, Jones revealed Manu Tuilagi could be back for both matches and believes his side are still capable of lifting the trophy. England sit third in the table, a point behind Ireland and four behind France, who are the red-hot favourites for the title after putting Scotland to the sword on Saturday to maintain their 100% winning record. Ireland, meanwhile, got back to winning ways with a commanding 57-6 win over Italy on Sunday and while England got the better of Wales at Twickenham on Saturday they were outscored three tries to one and were left hanging on at the end. Ireland are next up at Twickenham after the championship’s second fallow week – a match Jones described as a “semi-final” – before England conclude their campaign in Paris. “There are three teams that can win it now and we are one of those three teams so we’ve got a lot more belief than the three teams that can’t win it,” Jones said. “We’re in a good position. We’re in charge of our own destiny. We’ve just got to keep playing better, keep improving every game. We don’t fear anyone. We don’t care what other people think. All we care about is what we think and we know we’re a good young squad and a team that’s developing. “All in all we’re in a really good position and we’re looking forward to playing a semi-final against Ireland. We’ve started off the Six Nations with a narrow loss to Scotland, we were probably the most dominant team, an emphatic win against Italy and a good tough win against the Six Nations champions. So we’re definitely going in the right direction.” England will hold a training camp in Bristol next week before stepping up preparations for the visit of Ireland. Tuilagi will be absent, while Luke Cowan-Dickie sustained a knee injury against Wales which could rule him out for the remainder of the tournament. Tom Curry will also have to progress through the graduated return to play protocols after he was withdrawn on Saturday with a head injury. Tuilagi was a late withdrawal last Thursday with another hamstring injury, having only just been named to make his England comeback. Jones said that Tuilagi would require a 10-day rehabilitation period but reserved judgment on whether he would be available to face Ireland. “I am not even thinking about it at the moment,” he said. “Injuries have their own life. We will just wait and see. When we pick the squad for Bristol, he’s obviously not going to be available for that. Then I will pick a new squad for Ireland and I will see whether he is available or not. If he is available and he’s fit we will pick him and if he’s not then we will move on.”",Sport/Sport,"England fear nobody in Six Nations race, says Eddie Jones",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/27/england-fear-nobody-in-six-nations-race-says-eddie-jones
2/28/2022,"Man walks into a bar. Herringbone cap, baby face, topcoat flapping in silhouette, weaponry secreted in case things turn sour. Which they always do. “Glass of water, please,” he says. The French stereotypes at table four give him the evils. Nobody orders soft drinks in these parts if they know what’s good for them. You could cut the tension with a – well, a razor blade concealed in the brim of your cap would do the job. It’s 1933, in a remote outpost of la Francophonie called Miquelon Island, which, as you know, is just off the coast of Newfoundland, and, therefore, beyond Canadian and American jurisdictions. For years, these Gallic stereotypes have been ferrying bootleg whiskey to Boston. But, now, prohibition is ending and their business model is collapsing. Enter our hero, Tommy Shelby (Cillian Murphy), with a proposal for the locals. He places his business card on the bar. It reads: “Thomas Shelby Company Limited. Importer Exporter. Birmingham Boston San Francisco Shanghai.” It’s the last of those cities that is most relevant. The small-time Small Heath gangster has gone big, buying up a shipment of Chinese opium, and he plans to use French supply lines hitherto used for illicit hooch to flood the US with dope. If south Boston gang boss Jack Nelson, who is also the father-in-law of his familial nemesis Michael, won’t grasp this golden opportunity, Tommy will take his proposition to the Jews and Italians of east Boston – thus precipitating, most likely, internecine infelicity by episode two. Such is the setup of the final series of Peaky Blinders (BBC One), the show that has become, balti curries notwithstanding, Birmingham’s leading export product. Given that the city’s most distinctive contributions to world culture (Black Sabbath, Steel Pulse, Cadbury chocolate, HP sauce and Jack Grealish’s calves) have broken up or sold themselves to foreign capital, every right-thinking Brummie is behind the looming Peaky movie that will, fingers crossed, prolong the franchise. But what’s most significant about Peaky Blinders is not so much its narrative arc or its bump to the regional economy as its sartorial reproof to our disgusting era. We live in a time, after all, in which people have to be told not to turn up to Sainsbury’s in their jimjams. What a pleasure it is to see Beau Brummies strut their heteronormative, masculinist stuff. I’ve mentioned Tommy Shelby’s peerless silhouette, but you could cite Arthur Shelby who, even when off his nut on opiates, is quite the dandy, or Michael Shelby, who, though in Stateside chokey, wears collar and tie under his prison duds. Instead of Birmingham’s customary civic self-laceration, writer Steven Knight has given the city swagger. I doff my cap. More swaggering yet is Anya Taylor-Joy as Michael’s spouse Gina. There’s a moment in this series opener in which Joy Division’s Disorder starts up on the soundtrack like a beautiful anachronism, and she sashays down a corridor, heels clacking in time to Hooky’s bassline. Moments later, we see her busting jazz moves to a dance band on the radiogram, with the same aplomb she gave us when cutting a rug to Cilla Black in Last Night in Soho. What we are witnessing here is the succession of the title of Peaky’s Queen of Swagger from Helen McCrory’s Aunt Polly to Taylor-Joy’s Gina Gray. McCrory’s untimely death last year created a problem for Steven Knight. How do you write out the family matriarch? Here, Aunt Polly’s corpse lies inside a burning Gypsy caravan while the Shelby men stand hatless. It’s Birmingham’s equivalent of a Viking funeral and, given her Romany blood, what Polly would have wanted. But who killed Aunt Polly? A scary woman from the IRA rings Tommy to take responsibility. Shelby’s plan to murder the British fascist Oswald Mosley was for some inscrutable reason contrary to republican interests and, in any case, with Polly out the way, the IRA can do business with Tommy directly. How ironic, though, that Irish actor Murphy, who starred in Ken Loach’s The Wind That Shakes the Barley as an IRA man battling the Brits in County Cork, here plays an Englishman bent on folly, namely avenging his aunt’s death by taking on the IRA. But before he can flood Boston with dope or avenge Polly’s death, Tommy has to deal with another crisis back in Birmingham embroiling his daughter Ruby. In this family fixation, Peaky Blinders is like Dynasty, with a twist of the Small Heath-set Man Like Mobeen. Tommy is facing a war on three fronts across two continents. Our Zelig-like hero has always enjoyed having his fingers in too many pies. Indeed, after failing to kill himself at the end of series five, the clothes horse from nowhere is back where we want him to be: in all kinds of trouble.

2/28/2022,"It used to be painting the Forth Bridge which was considered the ultimate in never-ending jobs. These days it is the England rugby team, a work in progress for so long that people have almost forgotten what the original timescale was meant to be. There are some weekends, and this was another of them, when it also feels as if Tracey Emin’s unmade bed might be the secret artistic inspiration for Eddie Jones’s still-ongoing project. Nothing is ever finished with Jones, regardless of the evidence available. “It’s got no ceiling,” he insisted on Saturday night on the subject of England’s supposedly limitless attacking potential. Maybe so but it takes a coach of supreme self-belief to talk in such terms when his side has just been outscored at home by three tries to one by a Welsh team who, by their own admission, really started to play only after half-time. Luckily for Jones there was not an additional five minutes available, with a depleted Wales unexpectedly looking the more dangerous side. It means that England, on paper at least, are still in the title hunt with two rounds to play and a chance to confound all those who regard France and Ireland as comfortably the two strongest sides in the championship. In that respect an opportunity clearly remains for England to tear off the dust sheets and masking tape and reveal themselves in a different guise against the Irish at Twickenham on Saturday week. Do that and everything would hinge on a final weekend showdown against Les Bleus in the City of Light, an 80-minute blank canvas crying out to be filled with something momentous and daring. But are England really about to confound the restless critics? For all the elusive promise of their diminutive half-backs, Marcus Smith and Harry Randall, a closer look at the stats does not necessarily suggest so. In three games to date they have registered one try – Kyle Sinckler’s late effort against a well-beaten Italy in Rome – after the 53rd minute and have managed to average barely 11 second-half points per game against the three sides in the bottom half of the table. Those figures have also been massaged by Alex Dombrandt’s slightly contentious try on Saturday, a gift courtesy of an overthrown Welsh lineout and the apparent nudge which prevented Adam Beard from jumping for the ball. Remember when Jones was touting his “finishers” as England’s trump card and challenging his squad to become “the greatest team that ever played”? The World Cup is clearly his over-arching priority but it is reaching the stage where the gap between some of the things Jones says in public and the actuality makes the Grand Canyon look like a surface crack. He was at it again after the Wales game, indulging in his favourite pastime of taking gratuitous aim at the slightest hint of media scepticism. “We’re definitely on the right track; no one needs to tell us if we are or we’re not,” he sniffed at one point, before informing one respected reporter that he would no longer be replying – “Have a nice life” – to any questions from him in future. If England do end up becalmed in mid-table, though, it will prompt many to ask – with Jones now into his sixth year at the helm – whether a country with England’s playing resources might have made more progress by now with another head coach in charge? The Rugby Football Union, for example, could have hitched their chariot to Andy Farrell and Shaun Edwards, both now threatening to become serious impediments to England’s World Cup prospects, or hired at least 100 more gracious alternatives with greater affinity and affection for the English game. Maybe that does not matter to the RFU hierarchy but the sport still waits for a head coach to win a men’s World Cup with a nation other than his own. To be successful in 2023, furthermore, England need to find a consistent identity and stick with it. Everyone can instantly see what a defensively tightened, powerful, ambitious France stand for and there is a similar coherence to everything Ireland are now doing. England? They still seem stuck between two stools, lacking the overwhelming forward aura to give their backs the extra momentum that will make all the difference. Last year in Dublin the Ireland game was barely a contest, the hosts winning 32-18 despite a red card for Bundee Aki. The same referee, France’s Mathieu Raynal, will be in charge again and will hopefully preside over a more flowing spectacle than Scotland’s Mike Adamson oversaw on Saturday. Adamson has now awarded 50 penalties in two Six Nations games this year and, as an assistant referee for the Ireland game, the odds would suggest he could yet be a central figure again. In the meantime England will head to Bristol to train this week, with Jones claiming the squad’s new leadership group is bedding in nicely. “If a pregnancy is nine months we’re talking about the first two months here of where we want to be – what we’re seeing are some good signs. You don’t win a game like that unless you’ve got good spirit.” Perhaps but England will need more than emerging team spirit to overcome Ireland and France. They can only pray Wales do them a favour against the French in Cardiff on Friday week but, for all the impressive defiance of Wayne Pivac’s side, that feels unlikely. Either way England’s destiny, as Jones says, is still in their own hands. Finish the job from here and the bigger picture will be stunningly transformed.",Sport/Sport,Ever-changing England still have Six Nations fate in their own hands | Robert Kitson,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/27/england-six-nations-fate-eddie-jones
2/28/2022,"Was this the day to herald French brilliance or to bemoan the same old faultlines that persist so stubbornly in Scotland’s constitution? The temptation, if the bearing of the two camps afterwards is anything to go by, is to opt for the latter. Certainly, Scotland seemed more traumatised by the defeat than France were euphoric about a resounding victory at one of their less favoured grounds of late. Then again, the shrug of the French shoulders, so often a symptom of their own faultline, on this occasion seemed quite ominous. Their travelling fans were raucous and numerous in equal measure, but the sangfroid of this iteration of French players was notable for its contrast to their delirious support – and all the more chilling for that. Six tries to two in Edinburgh tells its own story. Gregor Townsend found the margin of victory particularly galling. “It looks very disappointing,” he said. “I think we’ve shown over the last couple of years that we’ve either won games or lost them by close margins. But whether we’d lost by a point or 20, it doesn’t change things too much. Our goal is to win, and to do that you have got to take your opportunities. Then it becomes a different game. The opposition have to do something different.” He will no doubt be referring to Scotland’s missed chances in the first half, but particularly one just before the break, when Scotland had played their way back to within two points of the French, having faced a 12-3 deficit after only 12 minutes. Of all the pale, traumatised Scottish faces, Stuart Hogg’s looked the most drawn. Scotland’s captain made his first start for Scotland 10 years earlier to the day – against France at Murrayfield. The reputation he has built since has been based on brilliance and speed, but he could be forgiven for feeling as if his legacy was slipping away with the ball as he spilled a long pass from Chris Harris with a simple foot race to the line ahead of him. The kind of foot race he would have won. That would have put Scotland ahead at the break. It would have forced France “to do something different”, as Townsend put it. Alas, France were never worthier of their growing reputation than when they proceeded to punish the mistake with calm ruthlessness. Two tries followed, either side of the break. Game over, another Scottish championship in vain. France now proceed with that most precious of assets in this short, intense championship: momentum. Two more wins stand between them and their first grand slam since 2010. Neither assignment is a gimme. Wales and England are hardly pulling up trees at the moment, but both know how to raise themselves against France. A Friday night in Cardiff is very definitely the sort of trip that could ruffle the composure of French teams of the not-too-distant past. England, meanwhile, laboured to beat a compromised Welsh side at home, but to be written off for a final-weekend visit to Paris would suit their psyche far better. France know a grand slam remains some way off. The way they reacted to this win at Murrayfield makes that all too plain. Scotland must raise themselves to face Italy a week on Saturday. Hogg spoke of his anguish that they had to wait another two weeks to play again. He wanted to play Italy the next day. Townsend said he wanted to play France the next day. Both men were struggling with the torture of another season of unfulfilled promise, as the rest of the squad must have been. At least the performance of Rory Darge was a positive. Scotland were missing a few key players, three of them in the back row, but Darge led a trio that held their own. He’s just turned 22. Hogg and Finn Russell are still in their 20s. Time is far from up for any of them. But in another 10 years, will Darge be in as much pain as his seniors were this weekend? Or will Scotland have turned their talent into something more tangible?",Sport/Sport,Scotland succumb to old faultlines in the face of France’s cool brilliance,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/27/scotland-succumb-old-faultliness-in-face-france-cool-brilliance-rugby-six-nations
2/28/2022,"Not for the first time this Six Nations, Eddie Jones was left lamenting a lack of ruthlessness from his side following a nail-biting victory against Wales. It is a word he has used often of late – clinical being another – but so far England have not been able to display enough of a cutting edge in attack to suggest they will finish top of the pile. They remain in the hunt for the title after keeping Wales’s second‑half fightback at bay but it seems clear that improvements must be made if England are to overcome Ireland and France in their final two matches. In seeking solutions the obvious answer is Manu Tuilagi. It cannot have helped that he was such a late withdrawal because Jones’s attacking gameplan would have had to be drastically redrawn but the wider point is how England struggle without him. Jones is eager to play down his absence – pointing to how England have had to cope for long spells of his tenure without the Sale centre – but that does not tell the whole story because one of the most successful aspects of the 2019 World Cup campaign was how the backroom staff worked wonders to keep Tuilagi in prime condition throughout. “If you’ve got someone like Manu you can create opportunities in other ways, if you haven’t got Manu you’ve got to find other ways,” said Jones. “This obsession with gameplans and plan A and plan B and who you’ve got and haven’t got… we look at the game. The defence creates opportunities. We believe we’ve got an organisation in our attack that allows us to take opportunities of those chances the defence may give us.” The fact is, however, that those opportunities are rarely being created, rarer still, finished, and with Tuilagi not out of contention to face Ireland his shadow continues to linger over England’s campaign. For the statistics paint a stark picture and in his absence England managed just two linebreaks on Saturday to Wales’s five. It was a similar story against Scotland, who also made five to England’s three, and it is little wonder given that for all the qualities Henry Slade and Elliot Daly can bring in midfield, gainline punch is not among them. Indeed, it was a curious sight to see a footballer as gifted as Slade on the crash ball against Scotland and against Wales, and again without Tuilagi England could not make the dents required. Ellis Genge, Alex Dombrandt and Maro Itoje all stepped up in that regard, but Tuilagi’s power and the manner in which he occupies defenders is unrivalled. “Manu is a top-quality player, there is no one really like him in the world so we were always going to lose that little bit of physicality,” Slade said. “It is challenging, obviously we had a plan of what the side was going to be and then to have it changed at the last minute is going to challenge us but I thought we adapted really well. There is no one else like Manu in the world, he is such a good player at getting you over the gainline, attracting defenders in – he is unreal. “We may have lost a bit of physicality but Elliot brings other strengths that maybe Manu doesn’t have and I thought the way we recovered and regrouped and went again was really good this week.” The upshot is that, the 33-0 win in Rome notwithstanding, England have managed two tries in two matches. Marcus Smith has scored 48 of England’s 73 points – or 66% – which on one hand, shows how well he has settled into his first Six Nations campaign, on the other belies England’s inability to make the most of what opportunities they have created. “What we’re not good at now is finishing off half breaks which we’ve got to keep working on,” Jones said. “That’s the next step in our project. It’s not so much in terms of being clever with our attack, more with staying right if the opportunity is there let’s take it. Increasingly each week we’re getting a little bit better at that.” Previously Jones has hinted that in an attacking sense England intend to keep something up their sleeve until closer to the World Cup. That argument was made when Simon Amor was the attack coach and the manner in which he was cut adrift following last year’s fifth-place finish suggests it is one that does not carry weight. Nonetheless, Jones is convinced that England will add the layers to their attack that are evidently absent at the moment over the course of the next 18 months. “We’re going to be peaking at the World Cup, we’re quite clear about that.” On current evidence, much will depend on Tuilagi’s availability if Jones is to be proven right.",Sport/Sport,Manu Tuilagi absence takes the bite out of England’s attack | Gerard Meagher,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/27/manu-tuilagi-absence-england-attack-six-nations
2/28/2022,"By order of you-know-who, the Brummie outlaws swaggered in slo-mo back on to our screens for their swansong series. Here’s your breakdown of Black Day … This episode was bookended by a touchingly tender tribute to the late, great Helen McCrory. It’s only right that we begin by paying respects to our own Peaky matriarch: the much-loved journalist Sarah Hughes, a Blinders superfan and previous custodian of this blog. Sarah sadly died of cancer in April 2021 – within 11 days of McCrory, in fact – aged just 48, filing copy from her hospital bed right until the end. Our friend’s memory lives on, not just in her passionate, perceptive journalism, but via her charitable trust and annual memorial lecture. Her memoir, Holding Tight, Letting Go, is published next month. We raise a large Irish whiskey in The Garrison to you, Lady Sarah. We last saw gang boss Thomas Shelby (Cillian Murphy) on the verge of suicide in series five’s gloomy finale. The action picked up precisely where it left off: still in the eerie morning mist, Tommy holding a revolver to his temple. He pulled the trigger. There was a click rather than a bang. Well, writer Steven Knight couldn’t kill off our antihero that fast. Tommy’s indomitable wife, Lizzie (Natasha O’Keefe), emerged from the murk, spitting with fury that he was going to abandon his family in such cowardly style. Elder brother Arthur (Paul Anderson) had removed the bullets on the way back from Oswald Mosley’s rally, when traumatised Tommy stopped at a crossroads (how symbolic) to throw up. Ever-loyal Arthur clearly knew the signs. Tommy learned last series that their mother killed herself but it wasn’t his time to “pass through”. After grovelling photogenically in the mud, he hauled himself back to the house in time to take a shattering phonecall. The chillingly calm tones of IRA leader Captain Swing (Charlene McKenna in trademark beret) explained that it was their operatives who foiled the Peaky Blinders’ assassination attempt on Mosley (Sam Claflin). The republicans needed him alive, presumably due to Mosley’s vocal opposition to the Black and Tans and qualified support for Irish independence. To bring Tommy back in line, they dumped three bodies on his driveway: his shellshocked war comrade Barney (Cosmo Jarvis), Gypsy hitman Aberama Gold (Aidan Gillen) and … you guessed it, the mighty Aunt Elizabeth “Polly” Gray, company treasurer and Tommy’s closest adviser. Oh, Poll. Bafta-winning actor McCrory was due to star in this series but became increasingly ill during the pandemic-enforced production delays and died from breast cancer before filming began. She now got a poignant send-off, Peaky-style. Polly’s body was burnt in a traditional Romani caravan, funereal black to match her trademark cigarettes. Her oil portrait – painted by artist lover Ruben Oliver (Alexander Siddig) in series three – gazed out imperiously as the flames rose. This gut-punch sequence effectively represented two minutes’ silence, punctuated only by crackling fire and cawing crows. Considering the circumstances, it was a classy, credible way for Polly’s journey to end. She’ll be reunited with fiancee Aberama in the next life. We also heard her husky tones echoing throughout the episode, notably her ominous warning to Tommy about her son Michael (Finn Cole): “There will be a war and one of you will die. But which one, I cannot tell.” True to their feud, Michael swore vengeance. We ended on credits accompanied only by birdsong and a simple title card: “Dedicated to the memory of Helen McCrory OBE, ‘Polly Gray’.” Go well, both. Leapfrog forward four years to 5 December 1933, the last day of prohibition. Now greying at the temples, Tommy strode across Miquelon Island, a French territory in Newfoundland, ready to do business. Possibly deadly business. With the bootleg liquor trade winding up, the natives were restless. Their smuggling boats lay idle. Tommy duly got a frosty reception in the local bar, not least by ordering water. Yes, Tommy was now teetotal – although repeated efforts to make him partake will be wearingly familiar to anyone who’s ever tried to attend a party booze-free. Maybe he’s pregnant or on antibiotics? Once he’d seen off hostile Jean-Claude (Spiral’s Grégory Fitoussi) with a switchblade (not that much “calmer and more peaceful”, then), Tommy had a sit-down with newly moustachioed Michael and his Boston-Irish mobster allies. Once again, the ambitious cousin’s outsider status to the Shelbys was reflected sartorially: fedoras and spivvy suits rather than flat caps and traditional tailoring. Tommy’s proposal? Replace one illicit cargo with another, using the infrastructure to smuggle the five tonnes of Chinese opium that the Blinders secured from the Triads in the last series. They’d ship it from Shanghai to Liverpool to Miquelon, then into the US and Canada. That required the approval of east coast kingpin Jack Nelson – the feared uncle of Michael’s wife, Gina, (glorious to see Anya Taylor-Joy back, despite ascending to the A-list since her last appearance). A tense standoff saw Tommy reciting poetry, refusing more whiskey and informing Nelson’s sneering henchman Connor (Love/Hate’s Peter Coonan, who’ll surely get his comeuppance) of an FBI informant in their ranks. Tommy gave Michael a 5lb sample to take home to Uncle Jack, before tipping off the border police. Sneaky. The cousins’ blood feud looks like being one of this series’ driving engines. Back home, Lizzie and Ada (Sophie Rundle) had been saddled with the extended Peaky brood, who were running riot. Lizzie was due to be taking young Charles and Ruby across the Atlantic for a holiday with their father, hence hosting an early Christmas party. Unfortunately, Santa, AKA Arthur, was merry to the point of catatonia after over-indulging in opium. Again. There was no sign of his estranged wife Linda (Kate Phillips), although word is she’ll return at some point this series. Instead, longsuffering Ada was reduced to picking up the pieces – a waste of the politically astute Shelby sibling’s talents. How long before she’s brought back into the fold? Her teen son Karl (after Marx, naturally, and played by Callum Booth-Ford) also seemed interested in entering the family business. We know how that usually ends. Festive travel plans were derailed when young Ruby fell ill with a fever. Tommy was seriously spooked when Lizzie mentioned what she’d said in her delirium: “Tickner maura, o beng.” Ruby was having visions of the Romani devil. He told Lizzie to call in Gypsy protection and vowed to hurry home on the next steamer. He’s already haunted by his mother and murdered wife Grace (Annabelle Wallis). Now the lights flickered and Tommy spoke to his aunt’s ghost: “Polly, they’re coming for me.” They’ve been coming for six series, Tom. Michael was languishing in Norfolk prison (nowadays known as Massachusetts Correctional Institution), blaming the FBI mole identified by Tommy – who’d since been shot in the head and slung into Boston harbour. Gina, power-hungry but rattled, was furious he’d gone back into business with “the devil”. She was even more rattled when Tommy visited her cavernous art deco apartment. Dancing to jazz and gulping whisky (all a bit Queen’s Gambit), Gina was every inch the flapper girl. Tommy was on her turf, so she relished delivering the message: no deal. Uncle Jack was moving in A-list circles nowadays and couldn’t dirty his hands with the heroin trade. As (nearly) always, though, Tommy was several steps ahead in this game of mental chess. If Nelson didn’t do the $5m deal, he’d instead sell to the Eastside Jewish mob run by the family of his old frenemy Alfie Solomons (Tom Hardy), firmly tipping the balance of Boston gangland power against Nelson. What’s more, Tommy knew Nelson was currently heading to Britain to secure whisky import licences – joined by Gina. With the incandescent Michael stuck behind bars, Tommy strutted off to flirt with his wife and parlay with his boss. Thomas Shelby OBE MP is sailing back to Blighty with a glint in those icy eyes. The series is beautifully poised to kick off in earnest. “There’s a man out there having his face stitched back up,” said Michael, to which Tommy drily replied: “Just a misunderstanding.” This episode’s elegiac feel meant tunes were lower in the mix. We heard Anna Calvi’s cover of Ain’t No Grave, while Gina was jigging to Count Basie’s Sixteen Men Swinging. The highlight, however, was Disorder by Joy Division. A rare week off for Nick Cave, but we daresay he’ll be back next week. In his dusty black coat. With a red right hand. Tommy recited the opening lines of William Blake’s A Poison Tree, a parable about repressed anger and the dangers of revenge. I fear Michael didn’t get the message. Black dogs, black cats, shot pigeons, cawing crows … The animal imagery didn’t augur well.

2/28/2022,"Ali Marpet, who helped protect Tom Brady during Tampa’s Super Bowl title in the 2020 season, has announced his retirement at the age of 28. The left guard, who is in the prime years of his career and was named to the Pro Bowl last season, confirmed the surprise decision on Instagram on Sunday. ESPN reported the decision was down to health concerns. “After seven formidable years with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, I’ve come to the decision to retire from the game that has given me so much,” Marpet wrote in his post. “This organization and the people surrounding it have helped not only fulfill a dream, but also helped build me into the person I am today. I’ve made Tampa Bay my home and I look forward to serving this community in the coming years. To the coaches and teammates, family and friends, an Instagram post simply can’t express the profound impact you’ve had on me. I’m eternally grateful. Thank you Tampa Bay.” Marpet was due to make $20m in the final two seasons of his current contract. He has career earnings of $37m. Marpet took an unconventional path to the NFL. The son of a fashion videographer and a former rock star, he played for tiny Hobart College before becoming the highest-drafted player ever out of a Division III program when Tampa selected him with the 61st overall pick in 2015. However, he flourished in the NFL and according to ESPN Stats & Information he had the ninth-best pass-block win rate among NFL guards from 2018 to 2021. “I think he accomplished his goals, values his health, is looking for more challenges. Ali has a very strong inner voice, and he is courageous enough to follow it. I’m in awe,” Marpet’s father, Bill, told ESPN on Sunday. Brady also paid tribute to Marpet, leaving a comment below his Instagram post. “Congratulations, @AliMarpet you are a warrior,” Brady posted. “It was an honor!!” Marpet was active behind the scenes in the league, and served on the Bucs’ social justice advisory board. Last summer he discussed voting rights with US vice-president Kamala Harris during the team’s visit to the White House to celebrate their Super Bowl victory. “I can’t say enough about what Ali has meant to our team over the three seasons since my arrival. He has been the consummate professional and has been a rock for us in the interior of our offensive line,” Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians said in a statement. “We will miss him on the field and in the locker room, but I am happy that he gets to go out as a Super Bowl champion and Pro Bowler. It is never easy saying goodbye to a player who has meant so much to our success, but I support and respect his decision and wish him a great life after football.”",Sport/Sport,Bucs’ Ali Marpet walks away from NFL at 28 with $20m still left on contract,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/27/bucs-ali-marpet-walks-away-from-nfl-at-28-with-20m-still-left-on-contract
2/28/2022,"Thomas Tuchel said that nothing will change for him after Roman Abramovich passed stewardship of Chelsea to trustees of the club’s charitable foundation. Tuchel, who also defended his decision to bring on Kepa Arrizabalaga for penalties in the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool on Sunday,on Sunday, which they then lost 11-10, insisted he is not concerned after a weekend of drama at Chelsea. Abramovich’s move to relinquish the running of Chelsea came after a call in parliament for him to be sanctioned and was said to have been provoked by the growing focus on him following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However the Russian, who announced the move on Saturday evening, remains Chelsea’s owner and the club's leadership structure has not altered significantly. The charitable foundation is headed by Bruce Buck, the club’s chairman, and football decisions by the powerful director, Marina Granovskaia, and the technical and performance adviser, Petr Cech, both of whom are already close with Tuchel. “I think it will change nothing for me on a daily basis,” Tuchel said. “This is how I understand it. I am in close contact with Marina and Petr Cech to run the first team of Chelsea football club and to give my input in this and give my very best to win football matches. This will not change with the news from yesterday.” There was a poignancy to the occasion as the Wembley crowd stood as one before the game to show support for Ukraine. “Football stands together” was the message on the big screens before kick-off, there were Ukrainian flags in the crowd and the players of both sides came together to show unity after entering the field of play. The action would begin only after Tuchel and his Liverpool counterpart, Jürgen Klopp, removed blue and yellow flowers from the pitch before watching their sides lock horns in a thrilling contest. Chelsea have lost their past four domestic finals but Tuchel said he had no regrets about losing 11-10 on penalties. The German refused to blame Arrizabalaga after bringing the goalkeeper on for Edouard Mendy just before the shootout. Arrizabalaga, who had helped Chelsea to win three shootouts this season, was beaten by each of Liverpool’s takers and lifted the decisive kick over the bar. “I feel bad for him,” Tuchel said. “But no blame. We took the decision because Kepa is training with the players on a daily basis at penalties. They know how good he is. He has more time than Edou to do this. Everyone knows how good he is. This plays a part in how well we shot today. “Unfortunately he could not save any. It was a bit harsh on him to miss the one and only penalty. But there is no blame. I take the decisions when I take the decisions. I only take them when I want to take them. I cannot rejudge my decisions when I know the outcome. “This is how it is. No blame on him. Blame on me. Sometimes it works out, sometimes it does not work out. This is life as a football coach who does substitutions. Sometimes you bring a player on and he scores. Sometimes he makes a decisive mistake. No regrets. If it is necessary to take the blame, absolutely it is on me.” Liverpool had a potential winner for Joel Matip ruled out for a tight offside and Chelsea, who also had two Kai Havertz strikes chalked off, were aggrieved that Romelu Lukaku had a goal ruled out by VAR. “We have to accept the quality of the opponent,” Tuchel said. “This is the most dangerous attacking side in Europe at the moment. Defending like this and playing like this made me very proud today. I had the feeling we created a bit more but maybe that is subjective. This game easily could have gone either way. You need a bit of luck. If you look at the line drawn for the goal of Romelu it is a bit of a weird line [for offside]. But that’s it. We cannot have any regrets.” Klopp praised Caoimhén Kelleher after starting Liverpool’s No 2 goalkeeper instead of Alisson Becker. “It’s been quite a journey from the boy I first saw to the man he is now,” Liverpool’s manager said. Kelleher, 23, was asked what Klopp said to him after Arrizabalaga's penalty confirmed Liverpool’s victory. “He just said: ‘Well done for scoring the winning penalty, there’s a wall with all the goalkeepers on who have won cups so now you can go on that,’” the Irishman said.",Sport/Football,Tuchel says Abramovich’s Chelsea move does not concern him after Wembley defeat,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/27/tuchel-says-abramovichs-chelsea-move-does-not-concern-him-after-wembley-defeat
2/28/2022,"The West End musical Frozen, the story of an ice queen and her fearless sister that captivated a generation, has dominated the only major theatre awards decided by public vote. But the lavish production lost out in the category of best new musical to Back to the Future: The Musical, an adaptation of the hit 1985 film about a young man forced to set up his parents after being accidentally sent 30 years back in time. At a ceremony at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London on Sunday evening, the veteran actor Sir Ian McKellen received an award for services to theatre in recognition of his seven-decade career, with performances ranging from Richard III to Widow Twankey. McKellan, who performed a one-man show in venues across the UK for his 80th birthday tour in 2019, was honoured for raising more than £1m for theatre charities and arts organisations. The 22nd WhatsOnStage awards were a “testament to the brilliance and resilience of an industry, who even in the bleakest moments of the past two years kept faith and kept going”, said Sarah Coleman, the website’s commercial and development director. Frozen, described by the Guardian as a “stunning musical extravaganza … packed with visual thrills and gorgeous choreography”, won seven awards. Based on the Oscar-winning Disney film made in 2013 – which was inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s fairytale, The Snow Queen – it tells the story of estranged sisters Elsa and Anna and a kingdom trapped in eternal winter. Its signature ballad, Let it Go, has become an anthem for millions of children around the world. The stage musical opened at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane last September after a delay caused by the Covid pandemic, and was playing to sellout audiences. But, like many West End shows, it was forced to cancel pre-Christmas performances when Covid hit members of the cast and crews. It won awards for best direction, set design, costume design, choreography, video design, musical direction or supervision, and graphic design. As well as best new musical, Back to the Future received three further awards for best supporting performer in a male identifying role in a musical for Hugh Coles, lighting design and sound design. WhatsOnStage has changed the titles of the acting categories “to represent everyone within the theatre community”. “These are first steps as we evolve the awards in the coming years to truly make them fully inclusive,” a spokesperson said. Eddie Redmayne, the Emcee in Cabaret, won best performer in a male identifying role in a musical, and Carrie Hope Fletcher, who plays the title part in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Cinderella, won best performer in a female identifying role in a musical. Anything Goes won best musical revival, and a second award went to Carly Mercedes Dyer for best supporting performer in a female identifying role in a musical. Best new play went to 2:22 A Ghost Story, and best play revival was won by Cyrano de Bergerac. Rent, at the Hope Mill theatre in Manchester, won best regional theatre production. Coleman said: “The breadth of talent honoured today, in the first major theatre awards to return in full post pandemic, demonstrates that theatre is back, and then some. “Today we also honour the audiences who stuck with us, and have voted this year in numbers never seen before. We’re nothing without them, and we are enormously grateful for their unwavering support. Together we build our industry back.”",Arts/Stage,Back to the Future and Frozen dominate WhatsOnStage awards,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/27/back-to-the-future-and-frozen-dominate-whatsonstage-awards
2/28/2022,"At least 368,000 people have already fled their homes in Ukraine, according to the UN refugee agency, and more than 4.5 million more could follow if the fighting spreads, Ukrainian authorities have said, with reports of tens of thousands on the move within the country itself. The majority of people are fleeing to one of 12 border crossings Ukraine shares with its neighbour Poland, which by Sunday morning had registered 156,000 arrivals. Others are crossing at one of nine border points with Romania, or into Hungary, Slovakia or Moldova, according to figures collected by the UNHCR. Those with relatives elsewhere in Europe are trying to make their way to other destinations across the EU and beyond. Most of those arriving are women, children and elderly people. They are carrying their belongings in rucksacks, plastic bags and suitcases, children are clutching cuddly toys, and some have pets under their arms. Reports from the border crossings have related tales of largely warm receptions, as people arrive often exhausted, some elated to be in safety and reunited with relatives, others distraught over what they have left behind. An internal report by EU officials said there were lengthy waits at most borders, including up to 70 hours to cross into Poland and about seven hours to enter Slovakia, with many forced to sleep overnight in their cars in subzero temperatures. The hold-ups were said to be linked to the sheer numbers trying to leave, and mainly due to delays on the Ukraine border, with officials there on orders to stop men between the ages of 18 and 60 from leaving. Polish authorities are said to be making the entry into the country as straightforward as possible. National willingness to receive Ukrainian refugees is very high due largely to the 1.5 million Ukrainians already resident in Poland and the strong cultural ties between the people. Polish and German media reported cases of men bringing their wives and children as close to the border as possible, sometimes handing children over to their mothers or even to strangers who were then instructed to meet family members already in Poland, working or visiting relatives. Some men sought people they could trust to bring their families to safety, before hugging them goodbye and returning to Ukraine to fight. At the border there are also plenty of men who have left their homes in Poland and elsewhere and are waiting to return home to their native Ukraine. Janusz Wolski, a 70-year-old farmer from the region of Szczecin in Poland, told Der Spiegel he and his Ukrainian wife had driven 800km (500 miles) through the night with his son to pick up his daughter-in-law and his three young grandchildren from Lviv, who were due to arrive at the border crossing of Dorohusk, a village in eastern Poland. He said the plan was for his grandchildren to stay with him at least until the shooting stopped. “Who knows whether they will ever go back?” he told the magazine. “It is unbelievable what this criminal Putin is doing to the Ukrainians.” Emergency camps are being constructed along the border regions and in addition thousands of residents of the host countries have been turning out to hand out blankets, water, bread, chocolate and coffee. Clean nappies for babies and medicines are also being supplied by local volunteers. Some have set up field kitchens and have been handing out bowls of goulash, while others hold up handwritten signs offering accommodation and transport. EU home affairs ministers are to discuss how to provide humanitarian assistance in Ukraine. At least 17 member states have already offered medical equipment, tents and blankets after Kyiv requested aid from the EU’s civil protection mechanism on 15 February. An internal note circulated to national capitals, read: “All EU member states are called to respond to the best of their capacities to the request for assistance from the Ukrainian authorities.” EU countries facing the largest number of arrivals have been told they can trigger the aid mechanism to request contributions from other member states to help them manage arrivals. The ministers will also look at giving a role to the EU’s border agency, Frontex, and the police agency, Europol, if, as expected, refugee numbers continue to grow. In Germany, home to about 130,000 people with Ukrainian roots, a number of federal states have offered help. Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, which borders Poland, and Berlin have promised help will be quick and unbureaucratic. Before the crisis, Ukrainians were able to travel to the EU without a visa and to stay for 90 days. That has now been extended to 180 days. As pictures of refugees arriving reminded Germans of the summer and autumn of 2015 when about 1 million people arrived in the country mainly from Syria, the national rail operator, Deutsche Bahn, announced that people from Ukraine would only need to show their passports to get free travel. All long-distance trains from Poland into Germany and up to Berlin would be free “in order to ease the onward journeys of people who are fleeing”, a spokesperson for the company said on Sunday. Meanwhile, across the EU, ordinary people were accessing accommodation and neighbourhood assistance platforms as well as Facebook pages allowing Ukrainians and people who are offering space in their homes to connect with each other.",News/World news,"More than 360,000 people have fled war in Ukraine so far, says UN ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/more-than-360000-people-fled-war-ukraine-so-far-un
