1/25/2022,"Palm Trees and Power Lines, a remarkably sharp-eyed and bruising debut from writer-director Jamie Dack, opens in the distended, languid stretch of a teenage summer. Lea, played in a stunning first turn by newcomer Lily McInerny, is 17 years old and bored. She lives with her single mother, harried and yearning Sandra (Gretchen Mol), somewhere in small-town, coastal California – palm trees and power lines, railroad tracks and modest homes – and floats through the days with sunbathing, YouTube makeup tutorials, and trips to the cheap ice cream chain store with her lustful best friend Amber (Quinn Frankel).  Lots of films mistake glamorizing and maturing adolescence for capturing it, but Dack’s feature, developed from her 2018 short of the same name, is saturated with the teenage. The actors are fresh-faced and gangly, and Dack has a keen ear for the vacuity and experimental crudeness of teenage conversations – boys ranking girls they know on a 10-point scale, girls playing along to hang, fart jokes, generally talking about nothing. Lea spends a good portion of the first 15 minutes prone – on the ground, on the floor with Amber, on the couch, on a lounge chair, in the backseat of someone’s car during passionless sex with a clueless boy – and the camera is there with her, on her level, hemmed by the smallness of her world. So when Lea catches the eye of Tom (Jonathan Tucker), a handsome 34-year-old mechanic, at a diner, the stark gap of their ages is immediately clear. Tom is muscular, graying at the temples, his cool demeanor barely concealing some jittery menace. Lea is a near child. She sees his wink, his autonomy, his curiosity in her, as magnetic, intoxicating, special. We see a girl made vulnerable by loneliness, red flags and a cliche. Dack’s tracing of this ominous seduction over the film’s first half is a brilliant portrait of isolation and hunger to be seen. Through McInerny’s pooled brown eyes and quicksilver laugh, we see Lea come alive under his attention. We see the Tom she sees – charming, empathetic, interesting – and how lines like “You’re not like any girl I know” and “I feel like I can be open with you” are so potent, thrilling. But the things Lea does not yet understand are never obscured: possessiveness that isn’t romantic but alarming, the manipulation of said lines, the pure sketchiness of a man who spends his days with a teenage girl. When Tom takes her to “his place” – a motel – for sex, Lea is initially disappointed, but subsumes it in desire. Dack manages to build Tom’s allure for Lea while still consistently puncturing it. Her friends call him a pedophile; a waitress asks if she needs help after witnessing one of their dates, and we know she’s right. Casting is essential here. In order for the relationship to both entrance and repulse, the characters need to look believably their age, not a Hollywood 17. Such was an issue with the Hulu series A Teacher, about a sexual relationship between a thirty-something female teacher and her 17-year-old student. Episodes were bookended with warnings and resources, but intimate scenes between the 24-year-old actor Nick Robinson, as the student, and Kate Mara’s teacher were titillating rather than queasy; in any other show, the two could plausibly play lovers. Same with An Education, the 2009 British drama in which 24-year-old Carey Mulligan, in her breakout role, played the 16-year-old schoolgirl half of a heady relationship with a much older con man (played by Peter Sarsgaard). Palm Trees and Power Lines provides no such out. McInerny, knobby knee-ed and adolescent-metabolism thin, looks as most 17-year-old girls do: more child than adult. Tom looms over her. In one crucial scene in the film’s quiet scream of a second half, Tom whisks Lea away to a hotel and Dack sets the camera across the room, so we can view both of their gazes as he undresses her – she ravished, astounded and disbelieving; he greedy, lascivious, wrong. There is no sheen of sexiness here. The film’s final section questionably dives into some brutally dark material, but avoids the potholes of melodrama by remaining grounded in Lea’s flickering awareness, then devastation, at the peril of her situation. Credit to an all-female creative team, including co-screenwriter Audrey Findlay, producer Leah Chen Baker, and director of photography Chananun Chotrungroj, whose restraint during a gut-punch, extended intimate sequence in the hotel room (there’s no nudity) keeps Lea’s frazzled nerves and silent horror at the center of devastating encounter. We are aware of her exploitation, the shock and disillusionment and confusion of it, without ever exploiting her body. It’s trite to say a debut performance is a revelation, but the whole film simply does not work without McInerny, who is fully convincing as a girl on an emotional precipice. It’s an astoundingly calibrated turn, one of barely lidded emotions that eventually skitter about. By the end, I had a pit in my stomach, desperate to know how Lea proceeds from dawning disillusionment. The summer evenings are still light, but there’s a heaviness in this unnerving, meticulous debut, knowing the events Lea will litigate with herself for years to come.

1/25/2022,"The world’s largest and most powerful telescope has reached its final destination – an observation post one million miles away from Earth. Nasa’s $10bn James Webb Space Telescope launched on Christmas Day last year from French Guiana on a quest to behold the dawn of the universe. Due to its sheer size, the JWST had to launch folded inside the Ariane 5, a European rocket.  The mirrors on the space observatory must still be meticulously aligned and the infrared detectors sufficiently chilled before science observations can begin in June. But flight controllers in Baltimore were euphoric after chalking up another success. “We’re one step closer to uncovering the mysteries of the universe. And I can’t wait to see Webb’s first new views of the universe this summer!” the Nasa administrator, Bill Nelson, said in a statement. “Wow, what a ride this last month it’s been,” said Amber Straughn, a deputy project scientist for Nasa. The telescope has been described as a “time machine” by scientists and will enable astronomers to peer back further in time than ever before, all the way back to when the first stars and galaxies were forming 13.7bn years ago. That’s a mere 100m years from the Big Bang, when the universe was created. The JWST will also hunt for possible signs of extraterrestrial life. On 8 January, Nasa engineers completed the unfolding of the telescope, which includes an enormous gold-plated 6.5-metre (21ft) mirror and a tennis-court-sized sunshield. The process required a series of highly delicate and complicated manoeuvres, a choreography that has not been performed by any other spacecraft in astronomic history. The JWST has been designed as a replacement for the Hubble space telescope, which remains in operation since its 1990 launch. Unlike the Hubble telescope, JWST will not study the visible aspect of the electromagnetic spectrum. Rather, it will study only infrared radiation. As a result, it has been fitted with complex shielding and advanced cooling equipment to protect its equipment from solar radiation that can trigger misleading signals. At 1m miles away from Earth, JWST is over four times as distant as the moon. Last December, Nasa scientists estimated its life span to be “significantly more” than a 10-year science lifetime. Considered the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, which orbits 330 miles (530km) up, Webb is too far away for emergency repairs. That makes the milestones over the past month – and the ones ahead – all the more critical. Spacewalking astronauts performed surgery five times on Hubble. The first operation, in 1993, corrected the telescope’s blurry vision, a flaw introduced during the mirror’s construction on the ground. Whether chasing optical and ultraviolet light like Hubble or infrared light like Webb, telescopes can see farther and more clearly when operating above Earth’s distorting atmosphere. That’s why Nasa teamed up with the European and Canadian space agencies to get Webb and its massive mirror – the largest ever launched – out into the cosmos.

1/25/2022,"US stock markets were hit by another wave of wild trading on Monday as investors worried that the Federal Reserve would wind down its support for the economy faster than expected and fears of a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine intensified. Last week’s sharp selloffs were repeated in early trading on Monday but by the end of the day, the S&P 500 stock index regained its losses, ending up 0.29%, the Dow Jones rose 99 points, or 0.29%, after dropping 1,115 points at its low, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.5%.  Stock markets hit record highs after highs last year. But so far this year the S&P 500 has fallen at its fastest rate on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and on Monday it briefly fell 10% from its most recent high on 3 January before regaining ground. The Fed meets this week and on Wednesday will give a clearer picture of how quickly it will raise interest rates in order to tackle soaring inflation. European and UK markets racked up heavy losses earlier in the day. In London, the FTSE 100 fell 2.6% to a one-month low. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index closed 3.8% lower, its biggest one-day fall since June 2020. In Germany the Dax fell by 3.8%, and France’s CAC index lost 4%. The selloff swept across other assets, driving down the price of oil as well as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. B​​itcoin too regained ground but has now shed half its value since hitting record highs around $69,000 in November. Jack Ablin, founding partner and chief investment officer at Cressett Capital, said that, with some provisos, the worst of the falls might be over. “I don’t think this will go for much longer,” he said. “Most of the damage has been done.” Ablin said he expected more problems ahead for some tech companies, which enjoyed a boom period during the pandemic. Some of the companies that grew exponentially during lockdowns, including Netflix and Peloton, were already suffering sharp share price falls and there would be more to come, he said. “Tech got way ahead of itself,” he said. He added that if the situation in Ukraine deteriorated or China saw Russia’s move as an opportunity to push its claims on Taiwan, markets were likely to fall again. “Dealers are worried about the prospect of a war in eastern Europe, as the human and economic cost would be huge. Some central European economies, like Germany, are heavily dependent on energy from Russia, and should a war break out, it’s a possibility those energy supply lines would be cut, which would cripple economic output in the EU,” David Madden, a market analyst at Equiti Capital, told Reuters.",News/Business,US stock markets see another wild day amid concerns over Fed and Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/24/us-stock-markets-close-nasdaq-dow-jones
1/25/2022,"Martin Freeman in a nightmare is an absolute dream for viewers. In the new five-part BBC One drama The Responder, he plays Chris Carson, a police officer on the edge. We follow him on a handful of night shifts in Liverpool that threaten – virtually promise – to push him beyond the limits of mental endurance.  His job is to respond to emergency calls. These could be anything – the constant state of readiness is as exhausting as it is exciting – but they are almost always a manifestation of poverty, inadequacy or desperation. He tells his therapist (Elizabeth Berrington) that he feels as if he is playing whack-a-mole. “Except the moles wear trackies. Every night, there’s spit on my face and blood on my boots and it never stops.” The script (the first original work for the screen by Tony Schumacher, a former police officer) is an astoundingly tough, vigorous, sinewy thing without a wasted word or moment. Freeman – who must have fallen on it like a hungry dog – does every bit of it justice. Carson is a man comprising layers of rage, suffering and despair, and Freeman slowly illuminates each one; he will surely win awards for his performance. You can feel his dragging depression beneath the explosions of anger (generally aimed at the trackie moles, whose endless, futile criminality and lack of personal responsibility erode Carson’s restraint), the stress and frustration, the abraded conscience. There is a good man suffocating under the emotional rubble. During the first episode’s night shift, Carson helps collect body parts at the scene of a road traffic accident, deals with neighbours’ disputes and attends the scene of a natural death. He moves through a world of intended and unintended cruelties and ignores tirades of abuse from gangs of lads as he drives around the city. He gets a call from his slippery friend Carl (Ian Hart, of course – thank you, God and casting). Town Centre Casey (Emily Fairn) – a local “baghead”, or drug addict – has gone missing. Could he look for her? When Carson finds Casey, she says by way of greeting: “There’s no warrants out for me!” He replies: “Nobody wants you but me.” It is one of many tiny, bleak moments that hollow you out before you have time to register them fully. She tells him she stole Carl’s stash of coke. “It’s not my fault!” she says. Carson snarls: “Whose fault is it, then? Fucking Thatcher’s?” That line packs about 700 PhDs of sociopolitical discourse into seven words and should be revered by writers everywhere. It is clear that Carl is not just Carson’s friend, but also a dealer, with Carson at least half in his pocket. But rather than let Casey get beaten senseless by Carl, Carson gives her the money to get a train to Leeds and safety. He feels, for once, that he has made a difference. He even tells his mother (Rita Tushingham) when he visits her in her care home. “I did a good thing – just a thing for somebody who normally doesn’t matter.” “Everyone matters,” she chides him, gently. “They really don’t,” he says. It is a measure of the strength and beauty of the script and the performances that this isn’t a dramatic moment. It is simply a recognition of the truth the public can usually ignore, but which he lives with every night and we have watched play out for the past uncompromising hour. Of course, Casey hasn’t gone to Leeds. She hasn’t been robbed of the coke, either, as she told Carson. The torque on the remaining four episodes (I looked ahead – I was unable to look away) is phenomenal, as is the blistering humanity and desperation of it all. In the therapist’s office, historical damage is revealed as the misery handed on from man to man is overlaid by new, more urgent problems. The Responder is as fast and riveting as a thriller and as harrowing as a documentary. It says profound things about the toll frontline jobs can take on our compassion and our morals; how fragile every structure, from an individual’s psyche to society en masse, is without emotional, financial and political support; and what happens when we become uncoupled from each other and have nowhere to turn.

1/25/2022,"More than 17,000 refugees, mainly women and children, could be prevented from reuniting with close family members in the UK due to new rules the Home Office plans to introduce, according to analysis by the Refugee Council. It is often male refugees fleeing conflict zones who make hazardous journeys through several countries on foot, in lorries and in small boats across the Channel in the hope of reaching safety in the UK.  They hope to be granted protection and under current rules they then have the right to bring close family members to join them, such as partners and children. The family members can travel safely to the UK by plane and can avoid repeating the dangerous journey made by the first family member. However, according to Enver Solomon, the CEO of the Refugee Council, new government plans in the nationality and borders bill, currently being debated in the Lords, will severely restrict family reunion and “all but destroy” the main safe route used by refugee families to reunite with loved ones. The government’s New Plan for Immigration aims to restrict family reunion rights for refugees who travelled through a safe third country before reaching the UK. This applies to the thousands who travelled to the UK in small boats. While the home secretary, Priti Patel, repeatedly talks about breaking the business model of the smugglers who bring refugees to the UK, advocating safe and legal routes to the UK instead, Solomon told the Guardian that the new government proposals will lead to thousands of women and children having no other option but to pay smugglers to board dangerous dinghies to cross the Channel. The plans will reduce rather than enhance the safe and legal routes Patel has been advocating, according to Solomon. Government data shows that over the last five years 29,000 people, over 90% of them women and children, have been able to come to the UK safely under family reunion rules to join a close family member already here and granted protection in the UK. The Refugee Council has calculated, using this government data, that as many as 3,500 people per year could be prevented from joining loved ones if the proposals in the bill become law – 17,500 people in the next five years. One Syrian asylum seeker, who fled war, imprisonment and torture in his homeland before travelling through several countries and reaching the UK, said he was “horrified” by the government plans. “We did not leave our country in search of happiness,” he told the Guardian. “I am talking here as the head of a family deserted. Rather, we went out to save our family from a war that does not know the young or the old and does not differentiate between the strong or the weak, in which no one can survive. “We walked in the most dangerous country, crossed the desert and crossed the English Channel in a rubber boat, knowing we may die in the sea. Has any official asked themselves what motivated us to risk ourselves … I was ready to die in order to save my family. What Priti Patel is thinking now is to eliminate our families by depriving us of family reunion.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We will continue to uphold our international obligations. More than 39,000 family reunion visas have been granted since 2015 under our refugee family reunion policy, with over half issued to children. “Our New Plan for Immigration will fix the broken asylum system so that it is fair but firm, helping those in genuine need through safe and legal routes while stopping those who abuse the system. Family reunion will continue to play an important part [in] our immigration system.”",News/Politics,New rules could prevent thousands of refugees from joining close family in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/24/new-rules-could-prevent-thousands-of-refugees-from-joining-close-family-in-uk
1/25/2022,"Taylor Swift has called out Damon Albarn, lead singer of Blur and later of Gorillaz, on Twitter after the British musician told the LA Times she “doesn’t write her own songs”. “I was such a big fan of yours until I saw this,” the American singer, 32, tweeted at Albarn. “I write ALL of my own songs. Your hot take is completely false and SO damaging. You don’t have to like my songs but it’s really fucked up to try and discredit my writing. WOW.”  Albarn had used Swift, in a promotional interview for a concert in Los Angeles, as an example of modern artists who hide behind “sound and attitude”. When the interviewer pointed out that Swift writes or co-writes all of her songs, Albarn responded: “That doesn’t count. I know what co-writing is. Co-writing is very different to writing. I’m not hating on anybody, I’m just saying there’s a big difference between a songwriter and a songwriter who co-writes.” He also compared Swift unfavorably to the dark-pop phenom Billie Eilish, whom he called “exceptional”. (Eilish co-writes her songs with her brother, producer Finneas.) Producer Jack Antonoff, who worked with Swift on her albums Lover, Folklore and Evermore, also weighed in on Twitter on Monday afternoon: “i’ve never met damon albarn and he’s never been to my studio but apparently he knows more than the rest of us about all those songs taylor writes and brings in. herb.” “[I]f you were there … cool … go off. if not … maybe …. shut the fuck up?” he added in a separate tweet. This is not the first time Swift has taken to social media to address indirect slights. In March 2021, she posted on Twitter to express dissatisfaction with a joke made on the Netflix show Ginny & Georgia, in which a character said another goes “through men faster than Taylor Swift”. “Hey Ginny & Georgia, 2010 called and it wants its lazy, deeply sexist joke back,” she tweeted. “How about we stop degrading hard working women by defining this horse shit as FuNnY.” Albarn, for his part, once publicly feuded with Adele, after he told an interviewer she was “insecure”, called her 2015 album “very middle of the road”, and speculated that music they had worked on together would not end up on the record. Adele responded in a Rolling Stone cover story shortly before the release of 25: “He said I was insecure, when I’m the least insecure person I know. I was asking his opinion about my fears, about coming back with a child involved – because he has a child – and then he calls me insecure? “It ended up being one of those ‘don’t meet your idol’ moments,” she added. “And the saddest thing was that I was such a big Blur fan growing up. But it was sad, and I regret hanging out with him.”",Arts/Music,Taylor Swift criticises Damon Albarn for saying she doesn’t write her own songs,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/24/taylor-swift-damon-albarn-write-own-songs
1/25/2022,"The US supreme court agreed on Monday to hear a pair of cases on race-based affirmative action in college admission, giving the majority-conservative court an opportunity to overturn protections that increase opportunities for individuals belonging to groups known to have been discriminated against. It is the latest high-profile so-called “culture war” issue to be taken up by the court, which is also set to examine major cases on abortion, gun control, religious freedoms and Covid-19.  Both affirmative action cases have been brought by Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), a non-profit led by the conservative activist Edward Blum, who has spent much of the last decade trying to end affirmative action in higher education. Harvard, a private institution, and the University of North Carolina, a state school, are the defendants for the two court cases. “Any ruling that calls into question the legality of race-conscious admissions would be a reversal of more than 40 years of Scotus decisions that have repeatedly and consistently confirmed the constitutionality and legality of race-conscious admissions in higher education,” Legal Defense Fund, a prominent civil rights law organization that fights for racial justice, said in a statement. Blum was behind Fisher v University of Texas, the last case on affirmative action that the supreme court considered in 2016. In that case, Blum argued that the university’s admission policies discriminated against Abigail Fisher, a white applicant. In a 4-3 ruling, the court upheld affirmative action, with then justice Anthony Kennedy being the only conservative judge who ruled in favor of the policy. However, the makeup of the court has changed dramatically since then, with three conservative justices appointed during Donald Trump’s presidency. Chief Justice John Roberts, who has in recent decisions voted alongside the court’s liberal minority faction, has also spoken out against affirmative action in the past. The cases will be the first opportunity the Trump appointees will have to review affirmative action. Historically, the court has upheld the use of race-based considerations in college admissions since the first affirmative action case in 1974, often citing the benefits of having a diverse student body. Jen Psaki, White House press secretary, declined to comment on the litigation, but said the Biden administration “strongly believe[s]” in the “benefits of diversity in higher education”. Lawyers from Harvard and the University of North Carolina, along with the US justice department, urged the court not to take on the case, saying that the schools’ policies were in line with affirmative action protections upheld by previous supreme court cases. Two lower courts upheld Harvard’s use of affirmative action, with one federal court judge saying that Harvard’s use of race was meaningful, but not “impermissibly extensive”. “Harvard’s race-conscious admission program ensures that Harvard can retain the benefits of diversity it has already achieved,” said US circuit judge Sandra Lynch in the US appeals court ruling. In a statement, Harvard’s president, Lawrence Bakow, said that the court’s decision to review the case “puts at risk 40 years of legal precedent” that allowed institutions to “create diverse campus communities”. UNC said in a statement that their admissions process was “consistent with longstanding supreme court precedent and allows for an evaluation of each students in a deliberate and thoughtful way”. SFFA alleges that race-based admission – which has boosted the admission rate of applicants from historically marginalized backgrounds, particularly Black and Hispanic students – has led to discrimination against Asian Americans. “It is our hope that the justices will end the use of race as an admissions factor at Harvard, UNC and all colleges and universities,” Blume said in a statement. “The cornerstone of our nation’s civil rights laws is the principle that an individual’s race should not be used to help or harm them in their life’s endeavors.” The court will probably hear arguments for the case in its fall session, with a possible ruling in summer 2023.",News/Law,US supreme court will hear challenge to affirmative action in college admission,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/24/us-supreme-court-affirmative-action-cases-college-admission
