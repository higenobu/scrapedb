3/8/2022,"How many Ukrainians escaping the Russian war machine have entered European countries so far? Ukraine’s close ally, with which it shares a 310-mile border, had received 1,204,403 refugees by Tuesday, the UNHCR said. The government has announced plans to set up an 8bn złoty (£1.34bn) fund for people fleeing Ukraine, including the provision of a one-off payment of 300 złoty (£50) for each refugee. A country that seven years ago built barbed-wire fences and deployed attack dogs to keep out refugees had allowed 191,348 Ukrainians to enter by Monday, according to the UNHCR. Local media claim that the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has softened his longstanding anti-refugee rhetoric ahead of April elections. Slovakia, another neighbouring country, had taken in 140,745 Ukrainian refugees by Monday, the UNHCR said. On 24 February, the country’s prime minister, Eduard Heger, said: “Slovakia is ready to help every Ukrainian who asks for such help.” One of the poorest countries in Europe, which relies heavily on Russian gas, had accepted 82,762 refugees from Ukraine by Sunday, the UNHCR said. The government has expressed concerns about the possibility of being invaded by Russia, and is seeking to join the EU. Around 30,000 Ukrainian refugees have so far arrived, with most coming through Poland, according to reports on Monday. The interior minister, Nancy Faeser, told the weekly Bild am Sonntag that Germany would take refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine no matter what their nationality. Some 2,500 Ukrainians had arrived in France, with some then looking to go to Spain and Portugal as well as the UK, the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, said on Sunday. Irish government minister Roderic O’Gorman revealed on Tuesday that 2,200 Ukrainians had arrived in the country. The day after Russia invaded, the Irish government lifted all visa restrictions. It also instructed airlines to accept Ukrainians who did not have passports but had some other form of ID such a driving licence or birth certificate. The Home Office said on Monday evening that it has granted visas to 300 Ukrainian refugees under its family scheme. It said 17,700 applications to rejoin relatives were also being examined. A second visa scheme set up for Ukrainians, which involves being sponsored by an organisation or individual, is yet to begin. Boris Johnson has ruled out setting up a third humanitarian scheme, which the home secretary, Priti Patel, claimed was being explored. The government is under pressure to speed up and simplify the visa process. At present, applicants must hand over biometric details and fill in complex forms.",News/World news,Where in Europe are Ukraine’s refugees going?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/where-in-europe-are-ukraines-refugees-going
3/8/2022,"The US Senate has unanimously passed the Emmett Till Antilynching Act, a bill to make lynching a federal hate crime. Such efforts had failed for more than a century. Bobby Rush, the Illinois Democrat who introduced the measure in the House, said: “Despite more than 200 attempts to outlaw this heinous form of racial terror at the federal level, it has never before been done. Today, we corrected that historic injustice. Next stop: [Joe Biden’s] desk.” The New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker, Senate co-sponsor with Tim Scott of South Carolina, a Republican, said: “The time is past due to reckon with this dark chapter in our history and I’m proud of the bipartisan support to pass this important piece of legislation.” Subject to Biden’s signature, the bill will make lynching a hate crime punishable by up to 30 years in prison. According to the Equal Justice Initiative, about 4,400 African Americans were lynched in the US between the end of Reconstruction, in the 1870s, and the years of the second world war. Some killings were watched by crowds. postcards and souvenirs were sometimes sold. The bill heading for Biden’s desk is named for Emmett Till, who was 14 when he was tortured and murdered in Mississippi in August 1955. Two white men were tried but acquitted by an all-white, all-male jury, then confessed. The killing helped spark the civil rights movement. The House passed Rush’s anti-lynching measure 422-3. Three Republicans voted no: Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Chip Roy of Texas and Andrew Clyde of Georgia. In 2020, in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis and amid national protests for racial justice, the chamber passed an earlier version of the bill with a similar bipartisan vote. Then, the measure was blocked in the Senate. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, said he did so because “the bill as written would allow altercations resulting in a cut, abrasion, bruise or any other injury no matter how temporary to be subject to a 10-year penalty”. Paul also called lynchings a “horror” and said he supported the bill but for its too-broad language. Kamala Harris, then a senator from California, now vice-president, called Paul’s stance “insulting”. Late last year, in another high-profile case, three white men were convicted in the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, a young Black man who went jogging in a Georgia neighbourhood. In an interview published on Tuesday, Christine Turner, director of the Oscar-nominated short Lynching Postcards: Token of a Great Day, referred to the Arbery murder when she told the Guardian: “There are many what people refer to as modern-day lynchings that may cause some people to take our history of lynching more seriously.” On Monday, in a further statement, Rush said lynching was “a long-standing and uniquely American weapon of racial terror that has for decades been used to maintain the white hierarchy. “Perpetrators of lynching got away with murder time and time again – in most cases, they were never even brought to trial … Today, we correct this historic and abhorrent injustice.” He also cited a great civil rights leader: “I am reminded of Dr King’s famous words: ‘The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.’”",News/World news,US Senate unanimously passes bill to make lynching a federal hate crime,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/us-senate-unanimously-passes-bill-to-make-lynching-a-federal-hate
3/8/2022,"Buses have begun leaving two devastated Ukrainian cities in a fresh attempt to evacuate civilians, as the number of people fleeing the country from Russia’s onslaught passed 2 million and the World Health Organization (WHO) warned Ukraine was running out of vital medical supplies. The Ukrainian state communications agency posted video of people with bags and suitcases fleeing the north-eastern city of Sumy, 30 miles (50km) from the Russian border, along one of five “humanitarian corridors” promised by the invading forces. “Sumy was given a green corridor, the first stage of evacuation began,” the agency tweeted. The governor of the Kyiv region also said civilians were being evacuated from Irpin, near the capital, with more than 150 having left the town on Tuesday. More than 30 buses were also travelling to the southern port of Mariupol, Ukrainian authorities said, with a second “humanitarian corridor” reportedly due to open between the encircled city and Zaporizhzhia, (155 miles) 250km to the north-west, local agencies reported. There was no certainty, however, how long the evacuations would last. Previous efforts were abandoned after Russian forces continued to bombard residential areas, and civilians trying to take the routes to safety themselves came under fire. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk warned that the Russian side was “preparing to disrupt the work of humanitarian corridors” and a spokesperson for the presidency in Kyiv said success would depend on how long the routes remained safe. There was also disagreement about what routes had been agreed. Moscow said its troops would enter “silent regime” from 10am local time to allow corridors out of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol, mostly leading to Russia or Belarus. Vereshchuk, however, suggested only a route out of Sumy leading to Ukrainian city of Poltava had been agreed, and reiterated the Kyiv government’s position that any evacuation routes leading to Russia or its ally Belarus were unacceptable. Demand for safe routes out of Ukraine’s battered population centres has increased rapidly as Russia has intensified its missile attacks and heavy artillery shelling of residential areas, creating a humanitarian crisis of fast-dwindling food, water and medical supplies. In the encircled southern port of Mariupol, which has been without power, water or heating since Friday, an estimated 200,000 people – nearly half the city’s population – are waiting to flee, with Red Cross officials awaiting news on a safe corridor out. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Tuesday a child had died from dehydration in the city. “In 2022, from dehydration,” Zelenskiy said in a video address, likening Ukraine’s humanitarian crisis to that created by the Nazi invasion during the second world war. Further ceasefire talks between the two sides are expected in the coming days but after a third round failed on Monday, negotiators warned not to expect subsequent efforts to bring any rapid breakthroughs. The Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers are expected to meet in Turkey on Thursday. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said on Tuesday that the number of people who had fled Ukraine since the invasion began on 24 February had reached 2 million. Poland said on Tuesday it had welcomed about 1.2 million people, including 141,500 on Monday alone. The Romanian government said 291,081 Ukrainians have crossed its border since the start of the conflict, while the EU’s top diplomat warned that as many as 5 million Ukrainians could flee the country if the invasion continues. Grandi said that after the first exodus, a second would follow consisting of more vulnerable refugees. “If the war continues we will start seeing people that have no resources and no connections,” he said. “That will be a more complex situation to manage for European countries going forward, and there will need to be even more solidarity by everybody in Europe and beyond,” he added. The WHO on Tuesday said attacks on hospitals, ambulances and other healthcare facilities in Ukraine had surged, with at least at least nine people dying in 16 attacks on healthcare facilities since the start of the invasion, and warned the country was running short of vital medical supplies such as oxygen, insulin, personal protective equipment, surgical supplies and blood products. The WHO’s Europe director, Hans Kluge, said the agency was particularly concerned about the health needs of women, including maternal health and emergency obstetric care. “Past conflicts have shown us that adolescent girls, women with disabilities and elderly women are in the most vulnerable situation,” he said. Russia has made significant advances in southern Ukraine as it seeks to block access to the Sea of Azov and establish a land corridor to Crimea. Elsewhere, however, progress has become stalled, including a long military convoy that has been almost motionless for days north of Kyiv. Ukrainian soldiers and volunteers have fortified the capital with checkpoints and barricades designed to block a takeover of the city of nearly 4 million people, using sandbags, stacked tires and spiked cables. “Every house, every street, every checkpoint, we will fight to the death if necessary,” said the mayor, Vitali Klitschko. Ukraine said on Tuesday its forces had killed more than 12,000 Russian troops since the start of the conflict as well as destroying 48 aircraft, 80 helicopters, 303 tanks, 1,036 armed vehicles, 120 artillery pieces and 27 anti-aircraft warfare systems. Moscow has so far confirmed about 500 of its soldiers dead. Ukraine’s intelligence service on Monday claimed its forces had killed a second senior Russian army commander, saying Maj Gen Vitaly Gerasimov, chief of staff of the 41st Army, had been killed outside Kharkiv. Zelenskiy said Ukrainian forces were showing exceptional courage. “The problem is that for one soldier of Ukraine, we have 10 Russian soldiers, and for one Ukrainian tank, we have 50 Russian tanks,” he told ABC News in an interview on Monday night. Zelenskiy will address British MPs via video link on Tuesday, the first time a president of another country has addressed the House of Commons. Formal parliamentary business will be suspended and MPs will be given headsets for simultaneous translation The British defence minister, Ben Wallace, said on Tuesday the UK would support Poland if it decided to provide Ukraine with fighter jets, but warned it could bring the country “into direct line of fire”. As western governments have moved to isolate Moscow diplomatically and economically, Moscow stoked fears of an energy war by threatening to close a major gas pipeline to Germany after the US pushed its European allies to consider banning Russian oil imports over its invasion of Ukraine. In an address on Russian state television, the Russian deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, said on Monday night: “A rejection of Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market,” and claimed the price of oil could rise to more than $300 a barrel. Novak’s comments followed remarks by the European Commission’s climate policy chief, Frans Timmermans, who said the EU could wean itself off Russian gas – which accounts for about 40% of Europe’s supply – within years and start curbing its reliance within months. The commission is due to propose plans on Tuesday to diversify Europe’s fossil fuel supplies away from Russia and move faster to renewable energy.",News/World news,Buses begin leaving two Ukrainian cities in fresh evacuation effort,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/ukraine-war-civilians-sumy-irpin-refugees-russia
3/8/2022,"People have been leaving Sumy and Irpin in north Ukraine and buses are travelling towards the southern port city of Mariupol, as fresh attempts are made to evacuate civilians from devastated areas on the 13th day of Russia’s invasion. Russia has stepped up its shelling of Sumy, where 21 people, including two children, were killed overnight, according to local officials. Video footage showed people leaving the city on Tuesday: Shelling was also stepped up against Chernihiv in the north and Mykolayiv in the south-west. Officials have warned that the humanitarian situation in Mariupol, which has been without power, water or heating since Friday, is grave. Ukraine’s intelligence service claimed its forces had killed the senior Russian army commander Maj Gen Vitaly Gerasimov outside Kharkiv. The UN said the number of refugees fleeing Ukraine had passed 2 million. On Thursday 24 February, Russia attacked Ukraine along multiple axes, bringing to a calamitous end weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by western leaders to avert war. Fighting and other military activity took place around and on the way to Kyiv. A substantial attack was aimed at the eastern city of Kharkiv. Russian forces also headed north and east from Crimea. On Friday 25 February, Russian forces reached the outskirts of Kyiv and carried out an amphibious assault from the Sea of Azov near Mariupol. The shape of the Russian incursion became clearer: On Saturday 26 February, Russian forces in control of territory to the north-west of Kyiv continued their assault on the capital. Elsewhere, heavy fighting was reported in and around Kharkiv and there were Ukrainian counterattacks in some places previously claimed by Russian forces. On Monday 28 February, Russian rocket attacks killed dozens of people in Kharkiv. Pre-dawn blasts were heard again in Kyiv and in Mariupol, which was surrounded by Russian forces and under heavy attack. On Tuesday 1 March, Russian forces bombarded the government headquarters in Kharkiv, and the armoured column continued rolling towards the capital. On Wednesday 2, Moscow’s forces took the port and train station in the strategically important city of Kherson, on the Black Sea. Russian paratroopers landed in Kharkiv overnight, after several days of fierce bombardment that killed or wounded dozens of civilians. Kyiv came under more heavy shelling as Russian forces stepped up their offensive and moved closer towards the capital in an apparent attempt to encircle it. A week into the Russian invasion, on Thursday 3 March, the Black Sea port of Kherson became the first major Ukrainian target to fall under the de facto control of Moscow’s forces. On Friday 4, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was seized by Russian military forces after a fire sparked by overnight shelling burned for several hours at the largest facility of its kind in Europe. On Saturday 5 a deal to evacuate civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol and the nearby town of Volnovakha collapsed, and residents in occupied Kherson and Melitopol took part in anti-Russia demonstrations. On Sunday 6 civilians came under fire as they tried to leave areas including Irpin, where a young family was killed. On Monday 7 Ukraine dismissed as immoral and unacceptable Russian proposals to evacuate civilians along routes into Russia or Belarus. Over the previous few months Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Vladimir Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/russia-war-ukraine-complete-guide-maps-video-and-pictures
3/8/2022,"This is a quietly promising Irish Gaelic-language drama that features strong work from Dónall Ó Héalai as John, a handsome neurodivergent loner in the Connemara mountains who defies the expected categories: neither a victim, nor a holy fool. Gauche and often monosyllabic, he’s also quickly amused, embarrassingly horny and possessed of a solidity that seems to emanate from the land itself. Twenty-eight-year-old John finds himself marooned in the adult world and in desperate need of direction when his mother dies suddenly. The “little God”, as a family friend puts it, raised by his parents is barely able to look after himself – let alone deal with being pestered by a local entrepreneur keen to scoop up his family’s land in order to put a windfarm there. After being beaten senseless by a local oik jealous of John’s supposed riches, he winds up on long hospital convalescence – and excited to be in regular close physical contact with nurse Siobhán (Fionnuala Flaherty). Writer-director Seán Breathnach, adapting Donal Ryan’s novel The Thing About December for his second feature, opts for gently elliptical storytelling that has to lurch to join the different strands: the buy-out, the local intimidation, John’s ham-fisted attempts – egged on by Dave (Cillian O’Gairbhi), his hospital room-mate – to woo Siobhán. But the narrative style does seem a close fit for John’s off-kilter consciousness, and enables some striking cinematography; not just the sodden landscapes, but pathos-laden closeups such as the orphan’s eclipsed moon of a face at the funeral. If Foscadh flirts with and finally swerves a hackneyed rural-tragic destiny in its final quarter, its ending feels like something of a compromise – and it’s a pity that Flaherty, as John’s sharp-tongued lover/surrogate mother, is out of the picture by then. But Ó Héalai fills the main character with a squirming, unabashed lust for life.

3/8/2022,"Two oil paintings by one of Britain’s greatest artists that have not been seen in the UK for more than 100 years will go on display at the National Gallery later this year. The paintings by JMW Turner are of European scenes that feature the artist’s trademark expanses of water and sky. Harbour of Dieppe: Changement de Domicile and Cologne, the Arrival of a Packet-Boat: Evening were acquired by the American industrialist Henry Clay Frick in 1914 and have remained in the US ever since. The paintings are being loaned for the first time by the Frick Collection in New York and will be on display as part of the National Gallery’s Turner on Tour exhibition this winter. Painted in the mid-1820s, the works reflect Turner’s lifelong fascination with ports and harbours as dynamic, transitional places, depicted in both oil and watercolours throughout his career. He travelled extensively around Europe, drawing in sketchbooks and producing paintings from them back in his studio in England. Turner visited the French fishing port of Dieppe, in Normandy, twice in the early 1820s before painting Harbour of Dieppe: Changement de Domicile in his London studio. Both paintings were exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s. Almost a century later, they were displayed at the Knoedler Gallery in New York, after which they were bought by Frick. Gabriele Finaldi, the director of the National Gallery, said: “Turner’s glorious river and harbour scenes from the Frick Collection are, through a special set of circumstances, coming to London for an unprecedented showing at the National Gallery. I am enormously grateful to our friends at the Frick for sharing their masterpieces with us.” Turner was elected an associate member of the Royal Academy at age 24. He was acclaimed by his contemporaries and attacked by critics, especially for his late, more abstract and experimental works. By the time he died of cholera at the age of 76, he was a wealthy man. He bequeathed much of his work to the nation, and the majority of the paintings are now at Tate Britain. Turner on Tour is one of three free exhibitions at the National Gallery that feature rarely loaned paintings from American institutions. Gainsborough’s Blue Boy ends mid-May; Picasso Ingres: Face to Face runs from June to October; and Turner on Tour runs from November to February 2023.",Arts/Art and design,Turner paintings not seen in UK for 100 years to go on show at National Gallery,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/08/jmw-turner-paintings-national-gallery-exhibition
3/8/2022,"Whether it’s mimicking venomous creatures, or shooting jets of water at aquarium light switches to turn them off, octopuses are nothing if not resourceful. Now, an analysis of underwater images suggests octopuses are increasingly using discarded bottles, cans, and other human rubbish as shelter or as a sanctuary for their eggs. The study – the first to systematically evaluate and characterise litter use by octopuses using crowdsourced images – analysed hundreds of underwater photos posted on social media platforms and image databases, or collected by marine biologists and diving interest groups. The research, published in Marine Pollution Bulletin, documented 24 species of octopus sheltering inside glass bottles, cans, and even an old battery; burying themselves under a mixture of bottle tops and seashells; even carrying plastic items around while “stilt-walking” on two tentacles, to conceal themselves from predators. “The deep-sea records were extremely interesting, because even at great depths these animals are interacting with the litter,” said Prof Maira Proietti at the Federal University of Rio Grande in Brazil, who supervised the research. “They clearly see that there’s a lot of litter around, and it can therefore act as a kind of artificial camouflage. “It shows their extreme ability to adapt. They are very intelligent animals, and they will use what they have at their disposal to continue sheltering or walking around with protection.” The octopuses seemed to show a preference for unbroken items, as well as darker or opaque containers, and the most common interaction recorded was using rubbish as shelter. Proietti said: “While these interactions could seem positive for the animals because they are lacking natural shelters such as seashells, it is not a good thing to think that the animals may be using litter as shelter because the seashells are gone.” Sheltering or laying eggs inside discarded tyres, batteries or plastic objects could also expose octopuses to heavy metals and other harmful chemicals, she said.",News/Environment,"Bottles, cans, batteries: octopuses found using litter on seabed",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/08/bottles-cans-batteries-octopuses-found-using-litter-on-seabed
3/8/2022,"Of all the bucket list destinations out there a trip to the world rugby museum at Twickenham might not be every Irish citizen’s first pick. Which is a shame. Yes, there are a few sepia-dipped images of olde English heroes with huge moustaches but any supporters over for Saturday’s big game will also discover some significant emerald-tinted artefacts. There is the jersey, for example, worn by the Irish forward Harold Sugars in his country’s first international against South Africa in 1906, when Sugars scored two tries but Ireland still lost. There is also a salute to the evergreen (in every sense) Mike Gibson while Noel Murphy’s jersey from the 1959 Lions tour of New Zealand, complete with the jagged holes inflicted by assorted All Black studs, needs no additional subtitles. The exhibit that really resonated the other day, though, was Moss Keane’s appropriately moss-coloured old shirt. Because it was Keane who featured in the game at Twickenham in 1982 that even now, 40 winters later, is remembered fondly by Irish rugby fans of all creeds and backgrounds as the crucial springboard to their team’s first Triple Crown for 33 years. The economic depression in Ireland was dispiritingly deep and, with unemployment rampant, spirits in Ireland were at a low ebb. Hence the excitement, with the great Ollie Campbell in his pomp, when Ireland went to Twickenham and won 16-15, with Gerry “Ginger” McLoughlin famously scoring the decisive try. That night Keane went out for a few beers in Camden Town, still all dressed up in his dinner suit, and did not have to pay for a drink all night. At one point he bumped into an exiled builder, one of the legions forced to leave their homeland for work across the Irish Sea. “Moss, it’s an awful shame to see a big lump of a man like you wasted playing that ol’ rugby,” said his new friend. “You’d be a great man at feeding a cement mixer.” As recounted in No Borders, Tom English’s masterly first-person history of Irish rugby, Keane was forever struck by the numbers of displaced Irish working people resident in north London whom he was representing whenever he pulled on a green jersey. “I always thought of them when I was up against England.” Which, in addition to the history-driven emotions invariably stirred whenever England face their Celtic neighbours, further helps to explain why Irish visits to Twickenham always have a distinct rattle and hum about them. At times the home of English rugby has been a bogey ground, which is why the glory days stand out loud and proud. Simon Geoghegan’s try in 1994, for example, helped to secure the only Ireland win in south-west London in a 22-year period until 2004, when the newly crowned world champions were toppled at home for the first time since 1999. More recently there was Shane Horgan’s tip-toe sideline nudge to ruin Ben Cohen’s day in 2006 and the indelible memory of another flying green winger, Tommy Bowe, slicing irresistibly through, with seven minutes left and his side trailing, to clinch another stirring Irish win in 2010. The only other subsequent championship victory, however, was in 2018 when the in-form Jacob Stockdale helped a dominant Ireland clinch a deserved grand slam that left England languishing in fifth place in the championship table, their worst finish in 31 years. In short, history would argue that conquering fortress Twickenham, regardless of the circumstances, is a consistent kitemark of quality for any self-respecting Ireland sides. So is winning a Triple Crown. Johnny Sexton was interviewed the other day after his side’s loss in Paris and revealed he is mustard keen to win the latter, having done so only once (as part of the 2018 grand slam squad) in his 13 seasons in the side. England, too, have managed to subdue all the other three home nations only twice in Eddie Jones’s seven-season tenure, which goes to show how hotly contested the Six Nations continues to be. With France now steadily re-emerging as a global superpower it also reinforces how problematic the championship can be to win, even in a good year. Especially if you happen to be wearing white and everyone hates you. This week, though, the boot feels as if it is slightly on the other foot. It is Ireland who beat New Zealand last autumn and who boast the more settled side. It is Ireland who also look the more cohesive unit, by virtue of their players being centrally contracted and, in many cases, able to play alongside each other regularly for Leinster. And it is Ireland who, in some ways, are seeking to make the grandest statement. Win well and all roads will lead directly to the 2023 Rugby World Cup. Buckle under, against an England side who have stalled lately, and it will not only blow any lingering title hopes but prompt questions as to whether further research and development might yet be required. Either way it will be seriously physical, with the hand of history on every green giant’s shoulders. For “Ginger” McLoughlin and Moss Keane read Tadhg Furlong and James Ryan, passionate competitors for whom a 2022 victory at Twickenham would be both a respectful nod to the boys of 1982 and a prized museum piece.

3/8/2022,"Britain should refrain from criticising Ireland’s open-door policy towards Ukrainian refugees, an influential Conservative MP has said, after anonymous briefings claimed it was creating a security risk for the UK. Simon Hoare, the chair of the Northern Ireland affairs committee and frequent commentator on Anglo-Irish relations, tweeted: “Instead of criticism of our Irish friends and neighbours, [the UK] could be much better replicating its response.” He added that the UK “needs to move today from pettifogging process to active delivery”. “Don’t criticise Irish republic: replicate it. Remember how we responded to Ugandan Asian crisis? We can and must do this,” he said. He was responding to claims that Ireland’s decision to lift all restrictions for refugees fleeing war would create a back door to the UK, leaving the country vulnerable to potential criminal elements. The Irish government minister Roderic O’Gorman told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that giving shelter to refugees was “the right thing to do”, revealing that 2,200 Ukrainians had arrived in the country since Russia invaded on 24 February, compared with about 300 in the UK. The country lifted its restrictions shortly after the invasion allowing Ukrainians to arrive without pre-vetting or visas. Hoare was responding to a report in the Daily Telegraph that the common travel area meant Ukrainians who didn’t pass the British security checks could simply reach the UK by travelling to Northern Ireland and then getting a ferry to the UK. Under the common travel area rules, British and Irish citizens can travel freely between the two countries without passport checks – although in practice they are required by most airlines. A British government source alleged that this opened a back door to the UK. “Ireland has basically opened the door to everyone in Ukraine which creates a problem,” they told the Telegraph. “We’ve seen this before with migrants from Albania that they have come through Dublin, into Belfast and across to the mainland to Liverpool. That’s created a drug cartel route.” The briefing made headlines in Ireland, where government officials have set up a refugee assistance operation at Dublin airport offering Ukrainians social security numbers, medical cards, housing and other supports. It has also opened a website where householders can register to take refugees in. O’Gorman defended the open-door policy as “the right thing to do” and said the justice minister, Helen McEntee, was in regular contact with the UK home secretary, Priti Patel. He told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that Ireland’s “easy access” approach was part of a wider EU response to the unfolding humanitarian crisis. “Everyone who looks at the pictures coming from Ukraine right now understands that we need an immediate and generous humanitarian response,” he added. Ireland is to take 2% of all refugees flowing into the EU as part of a Brussels pact among member states. The open border between Ireland and the UK on the island of Ireland has existed for decades. It became an issue during Brexit talks, with leave supporters advancing similar arguments over open routes to immigration and criminal gangs. However, the Irish and British governments argued at the time that ongoing close cooperation between the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda was the best way to crack down on drugs and criminality.",News/World news,"UK should not criticise Irish policy on Ukrainian refugees, says Tory MP",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/uk-should-not-criticise-irish-policy-on-ukrainian-refugees-says-tory-mp
3/8/2022,"No wine is more typically Spanish; none is more widely recognised wherever it goes. But sherry is so much more than just, well, sherry. Behind the familiar name lies a complex world embracing history and tradition, art and science, climate and soil, all of it wreathed in the rich culture of Spain’s deep south. Just as much as Bordeaux or Barolo, the town of Jerez shares its name with a world-class wine. Sherry’s origins are thought to lie in the first millennium BC, when Phoenician merchants in what is now Andalucía made wine in clay amphoras for export to Rome. But it was in the 12th century, with the arrival of England as a thirsty market for the fine local wines, that sherry began its rise to global fame. Sherry was born in the so-called Marco de Jerez, a rough triangle bounded by the seaside towns of Sanlúcar de Barrameda and El Puerto de Santa Maria and by Jerez itself, home of the famous-name bodegas and site of the wine’s denominación de origen. Like all great wines, its character derives in part from a particular terroir – in this case the chalky-white soil of the Marco de Jerez, known as albariza, which retains moisture and gives the finished wine a haunting touch of salinity. Globalisation has tended to homogenise the world of wine, but sherry has stuck to its guns, retaining all its idiosyncratic charms intact. If you’re looking for crisp fruit and quaffability, pineapple and French oak, you may have come to the wrong place. But adventurous drinkers are increasingly turning to sherry’s sit-up-and-take-notice flavours – think roasted nuts and dried fruits, honey, tobacco and sea breezes – as the perfect antidote to generic, same-old sauvignon and chardonnay. What you won’t often find in the bodegas of Jerez are vats of fermenting grape juice. Instead you’ll see high-ceilinged halls where rows of time-blackened barrels stretch away into the cool darkness. The mosto or base wine for sherry, made from white palomino grapes, is fermented at rural wineries and brought into Jerez to embark on the long process of blending and ageing. Fortified to 15% alcohol, new wine is added to old barrels – and the magic begins. A layer of white bloom known as flor (flower) develops on the surface of the wine, both protecting it from the air and bestowing a subtle aroma of freshly-baked bread. Stimulate the taste budsThis, in a nutshell, is fino sherry – a wine whose vibrant personality is turning a new generation of foodies into fervent admirers. Either in its classic Jerez version or as manzanilla, which is made exclusively in Sanlúcar de Barrameda, fino is sherry’s flagship and standard-bearer – not to mention Andalucía’s signature wine, consumed in vast quantities at the region’s great spring fairs and fiestas. Versatility is fino’s calling card. While it’s perfect on its own served cold as a refreshing draught, it does beg to be partnered with food, even more than most wines, partly because its bracing flavours actively stimulate the taste buds. In its hometown you’ll often see fino drunk with a platter of mixed fried fish (pescaito frito), a bowl of artichokes braised in olive oil, or at the very least a slice of payoyo goat’s cheese with a few succulent green olives on the side. Kept in the fridge door, a bottle of fino will last a week or more with the cork in, meaning that you can pour yourself a glass whenever the mood takes you. Its robustness makes it a good foil for egg dishes (try it with a freshly made tortilla de patatas), and this is one of the few wines that can hold its own even with notoriously tricky partners such as asparagus or blue cheese. Fino is the entry-level sherry, but for many it’s only the start of a fascinating journey. Next stop might be amontillado, the stronger-tasting, darker wine that happens when a fino loses its layer of white bloom and begins to oxidise. With its deep notes of toasted almonds and sun-dried apricots, a fine aged amontillado opens the door to all sorts of creative pairings, from acorn-fed ibérico ham to thin slices of mojama, the air-dried tuna delicacy hailing from the coast of Cádiz. Further along the line is oloroso, pungent and rich though usually dry, and fortified to 17% from the start. Oloroso is currently fashionable in Spain as a wine match for long-simmered stews of meat or game. A star among the sweetiesThen come the sweet sherries, a whole new chapter in themselves. Pedro ximénez (PX), mahogany-dark and marmalade-sweet, is so rich and viscous it can be poured over vanilla ice-cream – though it’s practically a dessert course in itself. But the real star among the sweeties, and the hippest tipple in Jerez right now, is the well-balanced blend of oloroso and PX traditionally known as cream. At the midday aperitif hour, or as part of the evening cocktail round, you’ll see locals taking their ease in the bars of old-town Jerez and, as likely as not, what they’re sipping will be a cream sherry splashed over ice with a slice of orange. Fino, amontillado, oloroso, PX, cream … all so different, yet together they form an expanding universe of gastro possibilities. Whether enjoyed on a terrace table in a pretty square lined with orange trees, or at your kitchen table on a Friday evening after work, sherry is Andalucía’s generous gift to the world. Varied, vibrant and versatile, there’s a style of sherry for every occasion – whether you’re looking for an aperitif, table wine or nightcap.
