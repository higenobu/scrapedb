3/14/2022,"Only about 120,000 orangutans remain in the wild, and despite the whopping $1bn that has been spent on protecting them since 2000, their numbers continue to decline. The orangutan is the most endangered great ape, but the picture is only marginally less grim for the others – except us, of course – and the trend is the same across the living world: we’re witnessing a sixth mass extinction. Given that current conservation efforts aren’t working fast enough, many feel it is time for some out-of-the-box thinking. It doesn’t come much further out than giving other species their own money, but that proposal is now on the table. The first to benefit might be our intelligent, red-haired cousins. “Interspecies money” is the brainchild of British futurist Jonathan Ledgard, who has built a reputation for throwing out imaginative, left-field solutions to the planet’s existential threats. He started with a few key observations. First, biodiversity tends to be high where people are poor. Second, technological advances such as drones, smartphones, genomics and data storage have made it easier and cheaper to track wildlife. And third, new software tools including cryptocurrencies, blockchain and artificial intelligence make it possible to create digital avatars with agency – including spending power – in the real world. If we can do that for humans, he thought, why can’t we do it for nonhumans, allowing them to trade with us for the things that matter to each? It’s an idea that’s a little hard to get your head around, especially if, like me, you’ve observed orangutans learning to count and stumbling over their ones, twos and threes. But in Ledgard’s plan numeracy isn’t required, at least not by the nonhumans. An orangutan would be given its own digital wallet that would be managed by scientists or conservationists on its behalf. The wallet would initially be endowed with the proceeds from sales of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). If NFTs can capture the value of one-off digital artworks, they can presumably do the same for rare species – or related digital entities. This money would be paid out to people living near the animal in exchange for protecting or observing it. As more species were drawn into the scheme, their value having been similarly recognised, a digital currency might emerge – Ledgard dubs it the “life-mark” – overseen by a central “Bank for Other Species”. The idea of interspecies money struck John McArthur as mind-blowing when he first heard about it. The director of the Center for Sustainable Development at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC was already convinced that the UN’s sustainable development goals for 2030 were unlikely to be met without some kind of technological breakthrough, and he thought Ledgard’s plan harnessed one. “Ultimately it’s about digitising the ecosystems of the world in a way that allows us to understand [other species’] preferences, which is interspecies communication,” he says. Brookings included interspecies money in its list of frontier technologies for sustainable development this January. Another fan is Costa Rica-based economist and entrepreneur Ranulfo Paiva Sobrinho, who sees interspecies money as a way of empowering local people. Once they have understood the problem, Sobrinho says, locals often propose better solutions than people far away. Others have been more circumspect. Economist Pavan Sukhdev, former president of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) International, disagrees with Ledgard’s starting premise, which is that markets have failed to price natural capital correctly (this was also the conclusion of the recent, and controversial, Dasgupta review commissioned by the UK government). Markets deal in private assets whereas nature’s resources are a public good that is provided free of charge, he says – and the two don’t mix. “Ledgard’s paper is steeped in the underlying belief system of so-called free market capitalism, which is that markets are the solution to all problems,” Sukhdev says. “That is wrong.” Joshua Farley, an economist at the University of Vermont, agrees: “Rather than trying to internalise nature into the economy, we should focus on internalising our economy into nature.” He gives the example of Brazil’s Atlantic forest, which has been so denuded that many experts now fear it faces catastrophic biodiversity loss. Farley’s group has been exploring how a tax might be levied on carbon or wealth that Brazilians could only pay in an “eco-currency” – the Mata Atlântica Restoration Currency (Marc). Marcs in turn could only be earned through reforestation activities, with the regenerated forest’s extent and hence its value being determined with the aid of geolocation. The advantage of such a scheme is that it gives people an incentive to do the right thing, says Paul Ferraro, professor of human behaviour and public policy at Johns Hopkins University. For at least a decade debate has raged over the relative advantages of utilitarian and non-utilitarian approaches to conservation – or protecting nature in exchange for some personal reward as opposed to doing so because it fulfils a moral obligation. One thing seems clear, Ferraro says: on its own, “doing the right thing is not an effective conservation strategy”. Though the debate rages on, it looks as if the right incentives can complement people’s moral drive to conserve. His worry is that the wrong ones could detract from it, so the choice of incentives is critical. Ferraro is not sure the life-mark is the right incentive. It does not seem to solve the central problem that the costs of conservation are borne individually, while the benefits are enjoyed collectively, he says. But he agrees with McArthur that technology is providing exciting new ways to think about that problem. Building on Ledgard’s plan for orangutans, for example, he wonders if NFTs could be used to pair conservation goals with the acquisition of digital assets. One example might be a scheme just launched by the British-South African nature channel WildEarth TV, where people pay to own digital material relating to individual animals – rather like adopting an animal in the virtual realm. At any rate, a number of economists I spoke to welcomed Ledgard’s contribution to the debate, even if they don’t agree with him. “We should be entertaining all ideas, because we have not solved the problem,” says Ferraro. The problem is only set to get worse, and whether interspecies money is the correct response or not, Ledgard the provocateur has achieved at least one of his aims – by prompting people to search for answers in new places.

3/14/2022,"Arsenal cruised to victory over Brighton on Sunday night, inspired by the attacking flair of the duo now fondly known as Viv-stenius. The arrival of Stina Blackstenius in the winter transfer window has allowed the prolific Vivianne Miedema to drop into a traditional No 10 role. Having a focal point to aim at has allowed the Dutch star to show off her array of playmaking attributes. It would not work, however, without Blackstenius up front. The partnership they have built in such a short time is remarkable and the Swedish goalscorer added two to her tally on Sunday. Arsenal are now unbeaten in nine in all competitions. With a significant fortnight ahead and the resumption of their Champions League campaign, the form of their flair players will be key to any success. SD Caroline Weir is renowned for her long-range spectacular goals, just remember her catalogue of strikes against Manchester United. She is now, however, fast becoming as deadly inside the box. Last season, Gareth Taylor highlighted his desire to see more productivity from the Scotland midfielder from inside 18 yards. His wish has been granted. Weir’s winner against Tottenham on Sunday was as scrappy as they come – a poacher’s finish practically on the goalline – following on from the two she scored in last weekend’s Continental Cup final. It shows the progression of one of the league’s in-form players. She has racked up five in four games, helping to lead Manchester City’s charge for that priceless third place and Champions League qualification. SD The English public knows very well how it feels when your shot crosses the line but isn’t given (see Frank Lampard in the 2010 World Cup). On Saturday it was Ona Batlle and Manchester United who got a taste of that misfortune in the 42nd minute of their win over Reading. The Spanish full-back cut in from the right flank and let loose a fiery shot that clattered in off the crossbar - and it really, really looked like the ball had crossed the line. Sure, Alessia Russo followed up and her deflected curler just moments later found the net to make it 3-1. But surely there is time for goalline technology in the WSL now, it will help everyone, including the officials, who will have ended up grimacing when they saw the replays. MN You know you’ve had a good day in the office when your manager is trying to lift you off your feet. On Sunday Sam Kerr – once again – deserved the elevation when she scored the 92nd-minute winner against Aston Villa to keep her side’s title hopes alive. The goal marks her 50th in Chelsea colours - and a much-needed one in a match where her side were without Fran Kirby and Pernille Harder. Emma Hayes thought Kerr did such a good job that she “almost lifted up” the Australian in the immediate aftermath of her winner. Chelsea now turn their attention to Wednesday’s game against Everton, where another three points, and perhaps another Kerr masterclass, will go a long way in ensuring the title race goes to the wire. MN Anna Anvegård put in one of her best performances for Everton on Saturday as she scored a brace, including the match winner, and recorded an assist in the club’s thrilling 3-2 win over Leicester. Her first goal came after she pounced on a defensive mistake with a loose pass finding itself at her feet but the second was more controversial. The Sweden international seemed to be in an offside position when the ball was crossed into the box and she managed to bundle it into the goal. Leicester players petitioned the officials and the club tweeted the offside flag had been raised. But despite the protests from the visitors, the goal stood to round off a near-perfect outing for Anvegård, which moved her club up to ninth. SR Fans are used to lengthy breaks in play for injuries to players but supporters at West Ham’s 1-0 win over Birmingham on Sunday were waiting as assistant referee Stacey Fullicks received medical attention. The official slipped 25 minutes into the match and medical staff rushed around her after she did not jump back to her feet. Fullicks was then taken away on a stretcher and replaced by fourth official Steven Hughes. The injury has not been confirmed but both clubs sent their well wishes and so do we.

3/14/2022,"Naomi Osaka’s emotional, tear-filled comments after she was heckled during her second-round loss in Indian Wells on Saturday immediately drew comparisons to the infamous incident at the same tournament in 2001 when the Williams sisters were mercilessly – and unjustly - booed. While the setting was the same and both instances reveal an ugly side of fandom, the circumstances surrounding each are decidedly not similar. At the 2001 tournament, minutes before a highly anticipated semi-final clash between Venus and Serena (who at that point were already both slam champions), Venus withdrew due to an injury. The next day, during the final between Serena and Kim Clijsters, a significant portion of the crowd heckled and booed Serena, as well as Venus and their father Richard who were watching the match at courtside. Serena eventually won the final as a proud and defiant Richard looked on. There was much talk at the time that perhaps Richard Williams had “orchestrated” the withdrawal by Venus so as to give Serena a chance to shine. And while Richard Williams left himself open for criticism with his highly unconventional – and extraordinarily successful – coaching techniques, the thought that the sisters would conspire and rob the event of fair competition was a stretch. And, indeed, the sisters had already faced off on a bigger stage when Venus defeated Serena in the semi-finals of Wimbledon in 2000, just eight months prior. What made the 2001 situation with the Williams sisters particularly repulsive was the mob mentality of an overwhelmingly white, well-off throng spewing insults and raining down boos on a young, black athlete. Serena said afterward that, “Nothing like this had ever happened to me. What was most surprising about this uproar was the fact that tennis fans are typically a well-mannered bunch. They’re respectful. They sit still. And in Palm Springs, especially, they tended to be pretty well-heeled, too. But I looked up and all I could see was a sea of rich people – mostly older, mostly white – standing and booing lustily, like some kind of genteel lynch mob. “I don’t mean to use such inflammatory language to describe the scene, but that’s really how it seemed from where I was down on the court. Like these people were gonna come looking for me after the match.” The Williams sisters from that point on boycotted the event until 2015 when Serena once again played in Indian Wells (Venus joined her a year later). Fast forward 21 years to Saturday’s incident with Osaka and the circumstances are different. This time there was no entitled, bullying mob, but rather a sole fan who let loose with the pathetic invective of “you suck, Naomi”. If it wasn’t so hurtful to Osaka, there is humor in the utter absurdity and idiocy of such a comment. Osaka “sucks”, really? One of the greatest athletes on the planet, who no doubt has accomplished more and worked harder for such than the woman who felt it was OK to yell such a thing. Andrew Krasny, who handles the post-match interviews on-court for Indian Wells, was no doubt aware of the tournament’s history when he said to Osaka, “Out of about 10,000 people, one person’s voice can’t weigh out 9,999 others. We love you here.” Unfortunately, abuse from fans who feel they have the right to say anything, no matter how vulgar or just plain wrong, because they have paid to watch athletes perform, is increasingly common. Players at this year’s Australian Open questioned whether fans’ boos (or was it siuus?) had gone too far. In soccer, England players were racially abused by their own ‘supporters’ after their loss at last year’s European Championship; the NBA has banned fans for confronting players at games; and NFL players were booed during a moment of silence to acknowledge inequality. The behavior even extends to professional wrestling, where WWE star Seth Rollins was attacked by a fan at an event in New York last year. And the discourtesy is a reflection of a wider breakdown of respect in society. The unofficial rules of decorum, part of the collective and informal social contract, have been tossed aside. One need only to look back at Joe Biden’s State of the Union speech a couple of weeks ago when the ultra-conservative member of Congress Lauren Boebert booed while the president was speaking about military veterans’ issues and the death of his son Beau. Osaka has been struggling to deal with the demands of being in the spotlight and she’s had a very rough 12 months. Most striking was her refusal to engage in press conferences at the 2021 French Open, which resulted in her withdrawal from the tournament. Some believed answering questions is part of an athlete’s job, others commended Osaka for having the courage to reveal her vulnerability in a very public forum. She went on to miss Wimbledon due to mental health issues and, after a third-round loss at the US Open, she took another break from the sport saying that winning did not make her “feel happy” any longer. Yet putting aside the obvious fact that heckling someone who has been struggling with their mental health is ignorant and cruel, the woman who told Osaka she “sucks” should be reminded of this: though the 24-year-old has tumbled from world No 1 to 78, she has still won a slam in each of the last four years. No other tennis player aside from Novak Djokovic can say the same.

3/14/2022,"A Russian former foreign minister has joined a call for all sides in the Ukrainian war to return to diplomacy and so reduce “the dramatically elevated risk” of a nuclear conflict. The appeal co-authored by Prof Igor Ivanov, now the president of the Russian International Affairs Council, may be a sign that some in the Russian foreign policy establishment believe that pursuing a purely military solution in Ukraine is a strategic mistake. Ivanov was appointed foreign minister under Boris Yeltsin in 1998 and resigned in 2004, four years into Vladimir Putin’s presidency. He has retained a status in Russian foreign policy circles. The statement urged all sides to back a ceasefire and end the “unjustifiable” loss of civilian lives. It was signed by Ivanov and a group of foreign policy heavyweights such as Wolfgang Ischinger, the former chair of the Munich Security Conference, Sam Nunn, the former US senator and co-chair of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, and Des Browne, the former UK defence secretary. As a Yeltsin-era minister, Ivanov is hardly part of Putin’s inner circle. But his position may reflect unease in Russia’s marginalised foreign ministry. The statement was published as negotiators from Russia and Ukraine met for a third round of bilateral talks on Monday. In advance of the talks both sides sounded more optimistic than before, but the cause for their optimism was unclear. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is pressing for a direct meeting with Putin. France, the UK and the US remain sceptical that Russia is yet willing to negotiate a settlement that the Ukrainian leadership would find acceptable. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, flew to Turkey for talks with Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Turkey has been offering to act as a mediator, and hosted talks between Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s current foreign minister, and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba. The statement co-authored by Ivanov avoids attributing responsibility for the war and instead focuses on the responsibility of nuclear states to eliminate nuclear risks. It says the conflict in Ukraine elevates such risks dramatically. “The firefight at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine was the latest reminder of how nuclear catastrophe can quickly rise to the surface in the ‘fog of war’,” the statement says. “The leaders of China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States together affirmed in January that ‘a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought’. “The first and most essential step toward reducing the risks of a consequential accident, mistake or miscalculation is a ceasefire to end the unacceptable and unjustifiable loss of human lives, including innocent civilians. “Dialogue, diplomacy and negotiations are the only acceptable route to resolving the conflict in a way that can stand the test of time. We must return to diplomacy and dialogue to ensure current disputes on core issues are negotiated and not fought. We welcome the first attempts of Russia and Ukraine to start such negotiations. We also welcome the efforts of world leaders aimed at finding a political settlement.”",News/World news,Russian former foreign minister calls for Ukraine ceasefire,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/russian-former-foreign-minister-igor-ivanov-ukraine-ceasefire
3/14/2022,"Two years ago, I ended a friendship. There’s no right or wrong way to break up with a friend, but a sensible thing might be to tell someone that they are no longer serving your needs – and to quietly disentangle your life from theirs. I didn’t do this. I swore at them over WhatsApp and didn’t respond to their messages ever again. I’m not an advocate of the current “fuck your friends” mode of self care that posits you shouldn’t feel a need to answer your phone, accept invitations or listen to people’s problems if you don’t feel like it. I think friendship is about showing up even if you don’t particularly feel like it. But I also have a tendency to put up with some particularly bad friendships for much longer than is necessary, and this was one of them. I was strung out from making allowances and excuses for this friend, and that day I’d reached my breaking point. Close friendships have their ups and downs: hurt feelings, neglect and friction occur because of the natural ebb and flow of our lives. A bad friend is something else entirely, an eyesore in our social landscape that for some reason we dare not dismantle. I used to imagine that I was attracted to complex, challenging, or unsatisfying friendships because I have imagination and empathy. I can see through defence mechanisms developed after difficult childhoods and I can understand what on first glance appears to be a horrible attitude for what it is: poor self esteem! This person is an overlooked puppy in a shelter and I am the one who will take them home! No such thing as bad dogs, I say stoically, as the dog in question savages my hand and pisses on my furniture: only bad owners. Instead of saying that something is unacceptable, I simply put up with it for years, hoping that with love and kindness it will all somehow magically resolve itself. Naive! Narcissistic! Unhinged! One obvious outcome of the last couple of years has been that those habitual relationships have been interrupted, and a break in order to re-evaluate those we spend time with has been afforded us. I look back at my social habits and see something glaringly obvious: I have often formed friendships carelessly. It appeals to me to act quickly based on an immediate mutual attraction. I have crossed a room to tell a woman that we should be best friends after having had a single conversation with her; I have gone on ill-advised minibreaks that have ended in arguments and an empty bank account; I have ruined several of my own birthday parties by inviting someone who has acted rudely, and I have defended these people to the hilt afterwards. They’re complicated! They’re shy! They’re depressed! Perhaps all of these things are true about the people in question, but the main thing that they have in common is that I have decided to be their friend – and that has historically been reason enough for me. These sorts of friendships resemble romantic relationships: there’s a lot at stake, emotionally; there’s an us-against-the-world sort of feeling; there’s an excess of mutual affection and support. Bad friends tend to demand a lot of support, something we are surprisingly willing to deliver. If somebody does you a kindness, it stands to reason that you would be moved to act kindly towards them in return. What’s known as the Ben Franklin effect is the complementary, but somewhat surprising, psychological theory that a person who has done a favour is more likely to see the recipient of that favour in a positive light. To ask someone to do something for you is to state plainly that the two of you are on sufficiently intimate terms for this sort of request and to dare them to contradict you. They won’t. People love intimacy. They love to feel useful, and needed, and tightly bound to other human beings. What better way to offer a person this feeling than to ask them to put themselves out for a moment, for an hour, for a weekend? It’s a cruel irony that the fear of asking too much of people is more likely to push them away. In some of the best examples of toxic friendship depicted in contemporary literature – Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels, Sally Rooney’s Conversations with Friends, Mary Gaitskill’s Two Girls, Fat and Thin – the dynamic is fairly straightforward: one introvert and one extrovert, a hot mess and her bookish companion. Of course, in reality, these archetypes are stifling. My bad friends have tended to reflect many of my worst qualities back at me, as well as a few of my better ones. Perhaps it doesn’t quite work, artistically: a bookish hot mess and her bookish hot mess friend. Surprise! Men can also make envious, manipulative and mean friends, too. Most importantly, I have to acknowledge the fact that I am almost certainly somebody else’s bad friend. After all, I have in the past forgotten birthdays, not made an effort with my friends’ boring partners, and continued talking about my own problems long after my companion has started to show visible signs of irritation. Maybe I no longer have the desire to either be a bad friend or to put up with one in my mid-thirties, but more likely I’m just resting in between bad friends and the next one is waiting right around the corner. Frankly, I’m excited to meet them.

3/14/2022,"Squatters have occupied a mansion belonging to the Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska in central London in the early hours of Monday. The five squatters in the building in Belgrave Square – two from eastern Europe, though not from Ukraine – say they feel their countries are also under threat from Vladimir Putin. Their plan is to open up the mansion, which they say “has too many rooms to count” including a cinema and a wine cellar, to Ukrainians fleeing the war, along with other refugees needing shelter. In a message to Russian oligarchs, the squatters said: “You occupy Ukraine, we occupy you.” A significant police presence barred entry to the cream-coloured stone building with a black front door and pillars at the entrance. This part of London has been nicknamed “oligarchs’ quarter” because so many wealthy Russians have bought properties here, a stone’s throw from Buckingham Palace. Deripaska is an aluminium magnate. He has called on Putin to make peace with Ukraine. The squatters also criticised UK banks and parts of the establishment that they say have allowed oligarchs to launder their billions in London. They declined to say how they got into Deripaska’s property shortly after 1am on Monday but said “it required climbing skills” and “squatters’ magic”. “This is not ordinary squatting, this is property liberation,” one of the squatters said. In a statement sent to the Guardian, the squatters said the invasion of Ukraine was the latest in a long line of human rights abuses by Putin’s government, including the bombing of Syria and mistreatment of LGBT people. “This mansion will serve as a centre for refugee support for Ukrainians and people of all nations and ethnicities.” The squatters said they were invoking the spirit of Nestor Makhno, a Ukrainian anarchist revolutionary. They said they would not leave the property willingly and planned to barricade themselves in if police or bailiffs try to remove them. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan police said: “Police were called shortly after 01:00hrs on Monday 14 March to a residential property in Belgrave Square, SW1. Officers attended and found that a number of people had gained entry and hung banners from upstairs windows. Officers remain at the location.” This is not the first time squatters have occupied an oligarch’s London mansion. In 2017, a group occupied the mansion of Andrey Goncharenko in nearby Eaton Square, which they said they wanted to open as a homeless shelter.",News/UK news,Squatters occupy Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska’s London mansion,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/14/squatters-occupy-russian-billionaire-oleg-deripaska-london-mansion
3/14/2022,"A Russian airstrike has hit a residential building in Kyiv as Moscow’s forces step up their brutal campaign to capture Ukraine’s capital and other major cities, even as a fourth round of peace talks between the two sides got under way. A day after Russia attacked a military base near the Polish border, an airstrike in Kyiv’s Obolon district killed one person and wounded several others, emergency services said on Monday, revising an earlier death toll down by one. One person was found dead in the nine-storey apartment building, officials said, with three more people hospitalised as air raid sirens sounded in the capital and other cities hours before Ukrainian and Russian negotiators were sent set to resume talks. Kyiv city authorities also said on Monday that the Antonov aircraft plant, also known as Hostomel, about 11km north-west of the centre, had been shelled. The site is the country’s most important international cargo airport, as well as a key military airbase. They said the city was stockpiling two weeks’ worth of food for the 2 million people who have not yet fled. The fourth round of formal talks – held via videoconference – would focus on achieving a ceasefire, securing Russian troop withdrawals and establishing security guarantees for Ukraine, a Ukrainian negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on Monday, after both sides gave positive assessments for progress. “The parties actively express their specified positions,” Podolyak tweeted. “Communication is being held yet it’s hard. The reason for the discord is two different political systems.” Podolyak had said earlier that Russia was “beginning to talk constructively” and he thought “we will achieve some results literally in a matter of days”. A Russian delegate, Leonid Slutsky, also said daily contact between the two teams had allowed significant progress and draft agreements could be possible soon. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said one aim of the “difficult negotiating work” was to set up a meeting between himself and Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, with the ultimate goal of “Ukraine getting the necessary result for peace and for security”. The country’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, called on the west on Monday to supply Ukraine with weapons and apply further sanctions on Russia to help prevent other countries being dragged into a wider conflict. “To those abroad scared of being dragged into WWIII: Ukraine fights back successfully. We need you to help us fight. Provide us with all necessary weapons,” Kuleba tweeted. “Apply more sanctions on Russia and isolate it fully. Help Ukraine force Putin into failure and you will avert a larger war.” As Russian airstrikes and artillery fire continued to hit residential ares, Ukraine’s general prosecutor’s office said 90 children had been killed since the start of the conflict. The UN has recorded at least 596 civilian deaths since Russia invaded Ukraine, but believes the true toll is much higher. Frontline towns around Kyiv were being successfully evacuated for the fifth consecutive day, however, the regional governor, Oleksiy Kuleba, said, adding that a ceasefire to allow civilians to leave was “holding, albeit it is very conditional”. The country’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said local authorities would try to evacuate civilians on Monday from towns near the capital as well as besieged cities in the south and east along 10 “humanitarian corridors”. Further attempts would also be made to unblock a humanitarian convoy trying to get food and medicine into the stricken city of Mariupol, Vereshchuk said. A Ukrainian presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, said on Monday that more than 2,500 residents of the Black Sea port, many of whose residents have been without power, heat or water for more than a week, had died since the invasion began on 24 February. The talks come a day after Russian airstrikes hit a Ukrainian military training ground near the Polish border, killed at least 35 people and wounding more than 130, and a US journalist was killed by Russian forces in a town outside Kyiv. The strikes on the Yavoriv base in the far west of Ukraine followed warnings from the Kremlin that western military equipment destined for Ukrainian forces was stored at the facility and describing western supply lines into Ukraine as “legitimate targets”. Zelensky warned on Monday that Nato member states could come under Russian attack if it did not act to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. “If you do not close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on your territory, on Nato territory, on the homes of Nato citizens,” he said in a video address. Washington and its EU allies have sent funds and military aid to Ukraine and imposed unprecedented economic sanctions on Russia, but ruled out any direct intervention, with the US president, Joe Biden, saying Nato fighting Russia “is world war three”. The west has imposed sanctions on Russian billionaire oligarchs close to Putin, frozen Russian state assets and cut off much of the country’s corporate sector from the global economy in an attempt to force Moscow to change course. Russia warned on Monday that while it had approved a temporary procedure for repaying its foreign currency debt, payments would be made in roubles if sanctions prevented banks from honouring debts in the currency of issue. Several US officials have said Russia has also asked China for military equipment. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, who is due to meet China’s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, in Rome on Monday, said China would “absolutely” face consequences if it helped Moscow evade western sanctions. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said US assertions that Russia asked Beijing for military equipment for its campaign in Ukraine were “disinformation” from the US, while Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for China’s embassy in Washington, said: “I’ve never heard of that.” China found the situation in Ukraine “disconcerting”, he added.",News/World news,Residential building in Kyiv hit by airstrike as Russia-Ukraine talks resume,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/russia-ukraine-kyiv-air-strike-hostomel

3/14/2022,"Diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine have increased, with Ukrainian and Russian negotiators to resume talks after Russia attacked a base near the Polish border and fighting raged across Ukraine. A barrage of Russian missiles hit Yavoriv International Center for Peacekeeping and Security, a base just 15 miles (25km) from the Polish border that previously hosted Nato military instructors, killing 35 people and wounding 134, a Ukrainian official said yesterday.

People have also been shot dead in the street. Why is Tucker Carlson in the news today? According to a report on Sunday, earlier this month the Putin regime in Moscow sent out an instruction to friendly media outlets: use more clips of Carlson. What else is happening? Here’s everything we know on day 19 of the Russian invasion. It has been more than two years since Donald Trump declared a national emergency owing to the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic. Now, even though the threat from Covid remains, US public health officials and researchers are looking to the next potential pandemic – whether it’s influenza, another coronavirus, antimicrobial resistance, or a different health threat entirely – as they hope to build on the progress and avoid the pitfalls of the past two years, writes Melody Schreiber. Scientists, several of whom have advised Joe Biden, have released a 136-page roadmap for moving from the Covid crisis to what they describe as the “next normal”. These investments include supporting health workers and strengthening health systems, as well as supporting survivors with long-term symptoms. Has Obama tested positive for Covid? Yes. “I just tested positive for Covid,” the former president, 60, tweeted yesterday, adding that other than a scratchy throat, he felt fine. “Michelle and I are grateful to be vaccinated and boosted, and she has tested negative,” he said. Here are eight charts that capture the past two years. These graphics show the costs and cautious hopes for the future. Australia and the Netherlands have launched legal proceedings against Russia through the International Civil Aviation Organization for the downing of the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The legal action could compel Russia to take part in stalled negotiations with the two countries, and could also result in it being penalized by the UN-linked organisation that is responsible for the administration of international aviation law. Australia and the Netherlands want compensation and an apology from the Russian Federation for the MH17 disaster. Two hundred and ninety-eight people, including 38 Australians, were killed when the aircraft was shot down over Ukraine in 2014. Russia, which has denied involvement despite the findings of an international investigation, unilaterally withdrew from negotiations with the two countries in October 2020. On what grounds are the countries taking the legal action? The joint action is under article 84 of the convention on international civil aviation, and will allege that Russia is in breach of the Chicago convention that underpins aviation law. Was Russia responsible for the disaster? Australia and the Netherlands say there is the “overwhelming evidence” that the flight was shot down by a Russian Buk-Telar surface-to-air missile system, which was transported from Russia to an agricultural field in the east of Ukraine on the morning of 17 July 2014. The director Jane Campion has called the actor Sam Elliott “a little bit sexist” and “a bitch”, for criticising The Power of the Dog, her Oscar- and Bafta-nominated western, for its driving theme of repressed homosexual desire and for being filmed in New Zealand. Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, who is meeting China’s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, in Rome today, has warned that Beijing will “absolutely” face consequences if it helps Moscow evade sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine. William Barr has doubled down on his vow to vote for Donald Trump if he is the Republican nominee in 2024, despite writing in his new book that Trump is dangerously unsuited for the job. He said: “Elections are binary choice, and unfortunately sometimes it’s choosing the lesser of two evils.” Biden’s hardline stance on Russia has won him widespread plaudits, but with the most serious oil shock in decades now a reality, the president’s attempt to cushion the blowback continues to meet resistance from the two allies he needs most. At some point in the stretch of days between the start of the pandemic’s third year and the feared launch of world war three, a new phrase entered the zeitgeist, a mysterious harbinger of an age to come: people were going “goblin mode”. The term embraces the comforts of depravity: spending the day in bed watching 90 Day Fiancé on mute while scrolling endlessly through social media, pouring the end of a bag of chips in your mouth, writes Kari Paul. Rises in sea levels driven by the climate crisis could reach 40cm (15in) by 2050, says Ruth Cerezo-Mota, an oceanographer at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), with four to 20 metres of beach on the Quintana Roo’s coastline lost. “This would mean chaos”, says Christian Appendini, a coastal engineer at UNAM. “All the beaches in front of urban developments would probably disappear unless drastic nature-based beach restoration measures are taken.” The New Zealander who unwittingly sparked an agonising global debate over whether there are more doors or wheels in the world has come to his own conclusion – “I’m firmly team wheels”. Auckland man Ryan Nixon, 37, decided to create a poll for his fewer than 1,500 Twitter followers. “My mates and I are having the STUPIDEST debate … And I am here for it,” he wrote. “Do you think there are more doors or wheels in the world?” By Sunday, the poll had exploded.

3/14/2022,"From sponsored haircuts to spending chilly hours standing on doorsteps selling homemade hot chocolate to passersby, many children in the UK have been doing everything they can to help young people in Ukraine. Save the Children said it had seen “unprecedented amounts” raised by children since the start of the war, at an average of £1,400 per young fundraiser – more than treble the typical average total of £400. Evie and Rowan Lewis, 13 and 11, from Ilminster in Somerset, raised £2,568 for Save the Children’s Ukraine fundraising drive by shaving their heads on Thursday evening. Rowan was inspired to do something after hearing about the war at school and seeing images online. “I saw the damage a missile attack had done,” he said. “I thought it wasn’t fair on Ukraine and wondered how many people must be injured, and how I could help.” The siblings discussed various fundraising challenges before Rowan suggested getting out the clippers. But it was Evie who found that her shorn head had unexpected leverage. “Being young and female, people are more likely to ask you about [having a shaved head], which is also a great way to help spread awareness,” she said. The siblings’ aim was to raise £100. As they saw their JustGiving total soar to 20 times that sum, they realised how powerful children could be. “I’m still surprised at the impact we’ve made,” Evie said. “Children are definitely more powerful than we’re credited for. I’ve noticed a lot of people have said about how young we are when they hear about what we’re doing – in fact, most people have. Us being young and raising money to help other children who are in need seems to have a very emotional effect on people, and if that isn’t powerful then I’m not sure what is.” Rowan agreed. “It has made me feel like children can actually make a difference in the world,” he said. Nine-year-old Ella and five-year-old Leo Ketley raised £1,859 by pledging to walk 43 miles for the children of Ukraine and inspiring friends to undertake their own fundraising walks. All the children will complete their walks – the distance that some Ukrainian children and their families have walked from Lviv to Poland to seek refuge – in their spare time throughout March. “I wanted to do something because if I was a child in Ukraine I would be feeling really scared,” Ella said. “I heard on the radio and I saw on Newsround that people had to leave the country, leaving toys and school behind. “I hope our money helps children have food and water, maybe some toys and books, and I hope that they can live the rest of their lives without worrying a bit and be happy.” Eight-year-old Zachary Clare raised £500 in 24 hours for the Red Cross DEC appeal for Ukraine last weekend, walking 10 miles from Amersham to Great Missenden in Buckinghamshire. Seven-year-old Veda Plotkin and her three-year-old brother raised £256 by selling hot chocolate and homemade cookies to passersby from their doorstep in Haringey, north London. “I felt that if I was in that war I would be really scared and upset, and I would not want that to happen to other children,” Veda said. “I felt like I had to do something for those other children. I was really happy to raise so much money. It made me feel I could be in charge of something. I felt it showed children can take the lead and don’t have to wait for adults.” Lisa Aubrey, the head of regional fundraising and engagement at Save the Children, said that within the first week of the Ukraine crisis the charity saw a tenfold increase in community fundraising, with at least 21 fundraisers coming directly from children. “We are so grateful for these amazing young fundraisers and are in awe of their creativity, courage and drive to help other children around the world,” Aubrey said. “We’ve seen children getting more and more imaginative with how they’re raising money.” She added: “Many people will feel incredibly inspired by the tenacity and enthusiasm of these young fundraisers. We can’t thank them and their families enough for their support. Our ambition to make the world a better place for children around the world simply couldn’t happen without their efforts.”",Lifestyle/Money,"UK children raise funds for Ukraine with haircuts, walks and bakes",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/14/uk-children-raise-ukraine-funds-charity
3/14/2022,"In January, a clip from The Tonight Show featuring Jimmy Fallon and Paris Hilton went viral: not because either had said anything particularly interesting or scandalous, but because the interview was so uncanny in its content and its style. In the video, Hilton, who looks like a telegenic, radioactive Barbie in a lime green cocktail dress, is discussing Bored Ape NFTs, the popular crypto images that have been selling for a minimum of $200,000 since their first release in April 2021. “I’m so happy I taught you what they were,” she informs Fallon in a voice a little lower than her usual characteristic purr. “You taught me what’s up,” he agrees, “and then I bought an ape.” Their back-and-forth, in spite of both these people having worked in entertainment for at least two decades, has all the breezy naturalism of a conversation between chatbots, as if somebody had made a Paris-Hilton-Jimmy-Fallon deepfake carefully designed to fail the Turing test. Hilton, as it happens, is not the only quintessentially 00s cultural icon to have embraced NFTs (non-fungible tokens; a one-off digital artwork), even if she might be the only one who describes them as having “literally taken over my entire mind and soul”. Lindsay Lohan, who once helped advise the readers of Interview magazine on how to get “filthy rich on NFTs”, has worked with a collective called Canine Cartel to release a much-mocked “fursona” NFT that depicted her as a sultry cartoon wolf. Gwyneth Paltrow revealed last month that she had acquired a Bored Ape NFT, its blond hair and Breton shirt selected to reflect her subtle taste. Eminem – never one to miss an opportunity for wordplay – bought a so-called “EminApe”. There is something oddly perfect about the marriage between NFTs and the most memorable figures of this period, maybe because many of the most popular works tend to approximate a mid-to-late-00s aesthetic: bright, cartoonish, closer to a two-dimensional Funko pop than to fine art. “A lot of the NFT market is based on collectibles,” the art critic JJ Charlesworth told Vice, “and there’s always been a visual culture in collecting: from comics, to trainers, baseball cards – that is very mainstream.” The most popular NFTs feature a single figure on a colourful background, making Charlesworth’s comparison to a baseball card especially apt. The Bored Apes all showcase the same humanoid ape wearing a variety of accessories and disguises; Lazy Lions do the same thing, but with lions; CryptoSharks, at least, have the distinction of being shown in various lurid, vaguely rendered global settings, as if they have been transposed into an acid-tripper’s vision of Hollywood or Beijing. I recently received an email about a limited run of NFTs called “Lobstars”, which depict “hyper pop” lobsters dressed as familiar works of art, including Andy Warhol’s soup cans and Marcel Duchamp’s urinal. On OpenSea, the popular NFT marketplace, it is possible to type in almost any animal and find a corresponding series. (I was somewhat stunned, for instance, to discover that some enterprising soul had produced 11 loudly patterned “Lazy Anglerfish”; one has sold so far for roughly the equivalent of £22). The upside of many NFTs having a uniform visual style is that, theoretically, as many of the medium’s biggest fans will stress, there is something inherently democratic about their design and their acquisition. If not every NFT creator makes the kind of money Bored Ape Yacht Club makes, they still have a fairly equal opportunity to share their work. Searching OpenSea for pieces is still easier by far than buying physical work from a gallery or an auction, and the only barrier to entry is a working knowledge of cryptocurrency. Buyers and artists who grew up on the internet of the 00s, meanwhile, may experience deja vu when given the opportunity to customise what is effectively an avatar, harking back to online cartoons like Blingees or Dollz Mania. When a rash of articles appeared in 2021 suggesting NFTs might be the Beanie Babies of the 2020s, the comparison was meant to be an insult; still, it is hard to overestimate the power of nostalgia when it comes to millennials on the web. In part, the interchangeability of these bestselling NFTs is the result of the way they are produced: Bored Apes and Lazy Lions, for instance, are created with an AI that adds minor variations to a template until 10,000 unique versions have been minted. Their similarity also allows those who purchase them to mark themselves out as a member of a club, making them as obvious a flex of the purchaser’s wealth as a Birkin bag or a shiny red Ferrari. In the case of Bored Ape NFTs, the purchase literally buys the owner entry into private online parties, making them a gateway into networking with other influential people. Unlike Fallon, I have not been lucky enough to have NFTs explained to me by Hilton; I can see, though, why they might appeal to internet-savvy celebrities, especially those devoted to growing a social media following. If they recall any previous art-world trend among extremely famous people, it might be the craze for buying pieces by the New York artist KAWS, whose Mickey Mouse-like figures with cartoonish skull-and-crossbones heads began cropping up in celebrity homes in the 2010s, and whose work became particularly popular with the Kardashians due to its Instagrammable aesthetic.“If branding and concept are the two most important elements in becoming a world-conquering artist in 2021,” a GQ profile of the artist suggested, “then KAWS is one of the few to have mastered both.” Setting aside the fact that this may be one of the most depressing sentences that anyone has ever written about art, if “branding” does make up a 50% share of what it takes to become “a world-conquering artist”, it makes sense that NFTs are conquering a very similar space to the one previously dominated by figures such as KAWS and, even earlier, by pop artists including Jeff Koons. Art that exists as a status symbol-cum-investment, packaged in a shell so mainstream that it requires absolutely no knowledge of art history to appreciate its style, has long been of interest to those looking to express themselves, impress their moneyed peers, and add to their financial portfolios in one fell swoop. Like Koons, who has produced garish bags for Louis Vuitton, and KAWS, who has designed a runway show for Dior Homme, Bored Ape Yacht Club has recently announced it is undertaking its own fashion collaboration with Adidas – a move that proves to be far easier for an artist or collective when its work already resembles a logo. If Bored Apes, Lazy Lions and Lobstars might be seen as fitting into an age-old tradition of artists depicting animals in their art, they might just as easily be seen as following the Ralph Lauren Polo horse, the Lacoste crocodile or the Swarovski swan in a long line of instantly recognisable fashion creatures designed to telegraph status and expensive taste. Just because the most popular NFTs tend to be simple, bright, cartoonish and produced in enormous, variable sequences does not, of course, mean that this is the only form of NFT that can be minted. It is possible, for instance, to make one out of a video. Rewatching that very eerie, very 2022, segment of Hilton and Fallon talking with restrained enthusiasm about MoonPay and Bored Apes, I found myself wondering whether anyone had yet been savvy enough to make this particular clip into an NFT. The flatly artificial TV lighting and the stilted dialogue both give the scene an unreal, almost hallucinatory quality. As in some of the CGI pop culture collages minted by the artist Beeple, who once released an eye-popping NFT of an absurdly muscular Elon Musk in front of an exploding rocket, we are seeing familiar figures in a disconcerting, unfamiliar context. As a historical artefact, the interview also ably captures a very specific time in human history: one in which the phrase “You taught me what’s up, and then I bought an ape” means something entirely different from what it might have only six months earlier. At the end of the video, Hilton tells the audience that she is giving each of them an NFT, and Fallon says that this must be the first NFT giveaway in television history. “Iconic,” Hilton smiles, and in accordance with the loosey-goosey, hyperbolic modern usage of the word – one that can apply to a TikTok or a jpeg of an ape as easily as it can apply to, say, a work by Basquiat – she may be right.",News/Technology,Are NFTs really art?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/14/are-nfts-really-art
