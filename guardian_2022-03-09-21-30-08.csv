3/9/2022,"The water regulator Ofwat has serious concerns over the way sewage treatment works at five water companies have been operated, as it continues to investigate the industry. Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, Thames Water, Wessex Water and Yorkshire Water submitted reports in December that have worried the regulator, Ofwat said on Wednesday. It said it was taking further action against the five companies and had started enforcement cases against them all. In 2020 the Guardian revealed that water firms had discharged raw sewage into England’s rivers 200,000 times the previous year. And last year Ofwat and the Environment Agency announced an investigation into potentially illegal dumping of raw sewage into rivers and coastal waters by water companies. The inquiry came after evidence that the scale of illegal discharges of raw sewage could be 10 times higher than disclosed by the firms. As part of the inquiry, water companies had to disclose information about the way they operated their treatment works, including details of potentially illegal discharges into waterways. “The data that emerged at the end of last year suggested widespread shortcomings in how water companies were running sewage treatment works. The first phase of our investigation suggests those concerns are credible,” said Ofwat’s interim boss, David Black. “We have identified shortcomings in most water and wastewater companies and are continuing to investigate. But we have already seen enough in five companies to cause serious concern and warrant us taking further action.” Ofwat said companies either reported a large number of wastewater treatment works that might not be meeting environmental rules, or failed to show how they were operating their works, or it had concerns about how companies met environmental obligations. “We will now dig deeper into what these five companies have been doing, with the prospect of formal enforcement against them if we find they are failing on obligations Ofwat enforces,” Black said. “We will have further questions for all companies on this. In the meantime, we expect them to make quick progress in addressing any potential non-compliance they might have, whilst strengthening how they manage their environmental obligations as a whole.” Earlier this year MPs on the environmental audit committee called for more assertive regulation of water companies as they said England’s rivers had become a “chemical cocktail” of sewage, agricultural waste and plastics. MPs want to see an urgent review of the way water companies are allowed to self-report pollution, and are alarmed at the extent of sewage discharge, large spills by water companies and misreporting. Southern Water was given a record £90m fine last year for discharging billions of litres of raw sewage into coastal waters off Kent and Hampshire over a period of five years.",News/Environment,Ofwat raises serious concerns over five firms’ sewage treatment works,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/09/ofwat-raises-serious-concerns-over-five-firms-sewage-treatment-works
3/9/2022,"It is August 2000. In a Seoul hotel at the second state-organised reunion of divided Korean families, Seung-Ki (from South Korea) is reunited with her father Kwan-Suk (from North Korea) for the first time in half a century. Allowed to meet for a total of 12 hours, arranged into six meetings over three days, there is much to be remembered, revealed and reconciled as the clock runs down under the surveillance of officials, CCTV cameras and the amassed international press.It is an almost unbearably dramatic situation. Evocatively directed by Sita Calvert-Ennals to a script by David Lane that is based on real-life accounts, Seung-Ki and Kwan-Suk’s meetings are punctuated and interspersed by Dan Canham’s choreographed physical sequences. On a stage of functional corporate hospitality designed by Lulu Tam and lit by Peter Small, there is an overwhelming sense that the time permitted is never enough. The musical score by Jae-Moon Lee and Duncan Speakman (with sound design by Speakman) causes fissures in time; it jarringly skips ahead, stretches back decades, and the future hurries to arrive.Words feel inadequate in such a pressing moment, and here the physical sequences are particularly compelling. A slowly collapsing body, a cheek almost set in a palm, or eyes that glisten as arms are outstretched, reveal a deep subtext. What is unsaid – by choice, ignorance or instruction – is articulated through movement, and it is a powerful exploration of the protracted quietude of grief. The acting is beautifully detailed, with both Jung Sun den Hollander as Seung-Ki and Kwong Loke as Kwan-Suk offering deeply committed performances. There’s an unsettling incongruence between the banality of the hotel setting and the unimaginable emotionality of the situation. Such contrasts are navigated deftly by both performers, and an extraordinary high domestic drama never strains incredulousness. Minor interactions are striking: a meal, eaten in stubborn silence, is a highlight.What Remains of Us is absorbingly staged, movingly acted and there is something unnerving about bearing witness to this brief enactment of reconciliation and hope in the ongoing Korean conflict while history turns another catastrophic page half a world away.

3/9/2022,"Good morning. Russian armed forces have agreed to hold fire in areas of humanitarian corridors from 9am to 9pm local time today, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister has said. Iryna Vereshchuk said the evacuation corridors would be open in several areas including the port city of Mariupol, but warned Russian forces against opening fire in those areas. Meanwhile, US congressional leaders in the US reached a bipartisan deal in the earlier hours this of Wednesday morning to provide $13.6bn to help Ukraine and European allies, reports the Associated Press. Joe Biden originally requested $10bn for military, humanitarian and economic aid, but the backing from both Democrats and Republicans was so strong that the figure rose to $13.6bn. Are there any more diplomatic talks planned? The Russian foreign ministry has actually claimed that its goals in Ukraine would be better achieved through talks and that it does not plan to overthrow the country’s government. Maria Zakharova, a Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, said Russia hopesd to make more significant progress in the next round of talks. Is this really a fossil-fuel war? That’s is what Ukraine’s top climate scientist believes. Both the invasion and the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report crystallized the human, economic and geopolitical catastrophe of fossil fuels for Dr Svitlana KrakovskKrakovska. What else is happening? Here’s everything we know on day 14 of the Russian invasion. The leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have declined to arrange calls with Biden in recent weeks as the US and its allies have sought to contain a surge in energy prices caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. According to the Wall Street Journal, citing Middle East and US officials, both the Saudi crownprince, Mohammed bin Salman, and his Emirati counterpart, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, have been unavailable to Biden after US requests were made for discussions. “There was some expectation of a phone call, but it didn’t happen,“ a US official said of a plan for Prince Mohammed and Biden to speak. “It was part of turning on the spigot [of Saudi oil].” Last week, the oil cartel Opec+, which includes Russia, declined to increase production despite western entreaties. Why won’t they talk to Biden? Relations between the US and Saudi Arabia have chilled during the Biden administration over American policy in the Gulf region. Issues include the revival of the Iran nuclear deal; lack of US support for Saudi intervention in Yemen’s civil war and its refusal to add Houthis to its list of terrorist groups. A Texas man who joined the assault on the US Capitol by Trump supporters was found guilty for his role in the attack on Tuesday, a milestone victory for federal prosecutors in the first such case to go before a jury. Guy Reffitt was found guilty on all five of the felony charges he faced, including bringing a gun on to the Capitol grounds and obstructing an official proceeding. His trial was seen as an important test case as the Department of Justice attempts to secure convictions from hundreds of defendants who have not taken plea deals. The federal jury in Washington returned the unanimous verdict after just two hours. What did he do on the day of the attack? Reffitt never entered the Capitol on 6 January 2021 but video showed him egging on the crowd and leading other rioters up a set of stairs outside the building. “I didn’t come here to play – I’m taking the Capitol. I just want to see Pelosi’s head hitting every stair on the way out,” he is heard saying during the footage. How was he caught? Reffitt’s estranged son Jackson, now 19, turned his father in to the FBI and testified against him during the week-long trial. The wreck of Sir Ernest Shackleton’s ship has been found off the coast of Antarctica, according to the Falklands Maritime Heritage Trust. Endurance had not been seen since it was crushed by ice and sank in the Weddell Sea in 1915. It was found at a depth of 3,008 metres. The Republican-dominated Florida legislature passed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill which forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade, despite a wave of criticism from Democrats and others that the legislation marginalizes LGBTQ+ people. About 40,000 residents in eastern New South Wales, Australia, remain under evacuation orders Wednesday morning as a dangerous weather system is predicted to bring damaging winds before drifting off into the Tasman Sea. Meanwhile, rivers in Sydney were still at major flood levels. Title 42, which was enacted under Donald Trump and kept in place by Biden, has led to hundreds of thousands of people being denied their right to asylum since the start of the pandemic. “Title 42 has nothing to do with Covid, it’s a terrific vehicle for stopping immigration,” said John Orlowski from Shelters for Hope. Texas’s highly restrictive abortion law has forced thousands of women to cross state lines to seek the procedure, according to research by the University of Texas. Since the passing of the law, known as senate bill 8 (SB8) last year banning almost all abortions in the state, an average of 1,400 Texan women a month traveled to nearby states between September and December 2021 seeking abortion services at 34 facilities. Without work or children taking up their time, and with decades of experience, many older people say sex has never been more enjoyable – whether it ends in orgasms or a cup of tea. Kate, 71, says she is having the best sex of her life. She met her partner, Lindy, nearly two years ago. “There is no more pretence any more,” she says. “All the bumps and bruises of our lives, all the experiences, it’s like a fire that burns off all the unnecessary stuff. I think it’s the understanding that this really is the last bit, and to make the very best of it.” “The global community was extremely complacent, and I see two reasons: hypocrisy, based on greed. People would make statements that they did not support Putin’s politics, and his oppression of the political opposition, and the wars that he started – this isn’t the first war by any means. But at the same time they would continue doing business with him … Stupidity. This is the second reason. People underestimate how dangerous dictators are,” says Nadya Tolokonnikova. Removing carbon dioxide from the air will now be essential if there is to be any chance of meeting global climate targets, a UK based thinktank has warned. Carbon offset markets will need to be tidied up and managed properly, as offsets will form a critical route to limiting global heating to 1.5C in line with scientific warnings, according to the Energy Transitions Commission, as switching to renewable energy alone will not produce enough carbon savings. Other methods, such as tree planting and carbon capture and storage, will also be critical. Scientists have found the oldest known ancestor of octopuses – an approximately 330m-year-old fossil unearthed in Montana. The researchers concluded the ancient creature lived millions of years earlier than previously believed, meaning that octopuses originated before the era of dinosaurs. The 4.7-inch (12-cm) fossil has 10 limbs – modern octopuses have eight – each with two rows of suckers. “This is a very exciting finding. It pushes back the ancestry much farther than previously known,” said Dr Mike Vecchione, a zoologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.

3/9/2022,"The British government has been accused of “betraying” women and girls after the harmful impacts of its aid cuts were outlined in a leaked report. Completed months before the government confirmed in September which aid programmes would be cut, the equalities assessment report warned a reduction in aid would have a significant impact on programmes for vulnerable groups, including women and people with disabilities. The report said the scale of the cuts would reduce services for women and girls who’d experienced sexual violence, while also affecting girls’ education and limiting attempts to advance gender equality. It warned the scale of funding cuts would affect the majority of social protection programmes designed to help “the poorest and most marginalised”. Sarah Champion, chair of the International Development Committee (IDC), said it was “appalling” that she had to use parliamentary privilege to make the report public. She said the government had blocked the committee from scrutinising the report for close to a year. “Our committee was denied access to the equalities assessment seemingly for ministers to dodge the humiliation of admitting their own aid cuts undermined the government’s key development objective: to support women and girls,” said Champion. Before posting it on the IDC website on Tuesday, which was International Women’s Day, Champion made a final plea in parliament for the report to be published. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, refused. “We are restoring the aid budget for women and girls back to previous levels and we’re also restoring the humanitarian aid budget, but it is a matter of policy that we don’t publicly report equality impact assessments because it has a chilling effect and people can’t be honest internally,” said Truss. Champion responded that this was untrue, as the government had published similar reports into Covid policy. Stephanie Draper, CEO at Bond, a UK international development network, said the government had put lives at risk by not publishing the report. “It’s saddening that the harmful impact of the aid cuts on women and girls was known before it happened – and that nothing was done,” said Draper. “If this assessment had been made public a year ago, NGOs and our partners could have mitigated risks to programmes protecting women and girls from gender-based violence and delivering clean water to marginalised communities.” Rose Caldwell, chief executive of Plan International UK, called the government’s actions shameful. “This is nothing less than a betrayal of women and girls around the world,” she said. “To add insult to injury, we are only now learning about this through the legal immunity of an MP, and not in response to numerous letters and asks by MPs, peers, and civil society. This lack of transparency is unacceptable and suggests the government intended to bury these findings.”",News/Global development,UK accused of ‘betraying’ women as leaked report warns of aid cut impacts,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/09/uk-accused-of-betraying-women-as-leaked-report-warns-of-aid-cut-impacts
3/9/2022,"Ramen is more than just a noodle soup, though it is indisputably one of the best. It’s an international obsession, a dish with Chinese origins that’s said to define modern Japanese food culture, and now enjoyed on every continent. And I mean every: instant ramen is popular fare on polar expeditions. But at home, go one better and make some yourself. Prep 10 minCook 3 hr 15 minServes 44 bunches ramen noodles 100g tinned sweetcorn75g tinned bamboo shoots For the broth4 chicken wings 500g piece pork belly, rolled and tied 500ml good-quality chicken stock 5g dried shiitake mushrooms 15g root ginger, thickly sliced but not peeled 4 spring onions, whites only (save the tops to serve)10g kombu (dried kelp) For the eggs4 medium eggs1½ tsp caster sugar 100ml Japanese soy sauce For the chilli sauce300ml neutral oil 2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped 1 spring onion, finely sliced 1 tbsp grated fresh ginger 20g chilli flakes 1 tsp sugar (optional)1 tbsp sesame seeds For the tare150g red miso 150g white miso 2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed 1½ tbsp sugar 1 tbsp mirin 1 tsp neri goma (Japanese sesame paste, optional)1 tbsp oil Though there are many different varieties of ramen, this umami-packed miso version from the northern island of Hokkaido is one of my favourites. Ramen generally consists of a rich, often meaty broth, noodles, a seasoning paste known as the tare, and toppings that can be varied according to preference (see step 9). If you’re preparing the stock in advance, I’d recommend making another batch of the egg marinade as below, then submerging the cooked pork belly in it until you’re ready to cook the ramen itself. Otherwise, store the pork in the stock in the fridge once it’s ready, because this will stop it drying out too much. Put the wings and pork belly in a large pot with the remaining broth ingredients and one and a quarter litres of cold water. Bring to a boil, skim, turn down the heat, partially cover and leave to simmer gently for about three hours, until the belly is tender. (Vegetarians, leave out the meat, use vegetable stock and simmer for 15 minutes.) Meanwhile, pierce the eggs at the round end with a needle, boil for six and a half minutes, cool under cold water, then peel. Whisk the sugar for the marinade into 100ml water to dissolve, stir in the soy sauce, then add the peeled eggs and marinate for at least three hours, or overnight in the fridge, turning occasionally so they colour evenly. Put the oil in a medium pan with the garlic, spring onions and ginger, and cook on a medium heat until golden. Add the chilli flakes and turn off the heat. Stir regularly until cool, then mix in the sugar and sesame seeds. Store in a jar and use any left over on rice, noodles, vegetables and so on. Mix all the ingredients for the tare except for the oil, then heat the oil in a small frying pan over a medium heat and fry the paste for five minutes, stirring regularly. (If you can’t find neri goma, tahini makes an imperfect but adequate substitute. If one of the miso pastes eludes you, use twice as much of the one you have.) When you are ready to eat, finely slice the reserved spring onion tops, discarding any tough, dry bits, and cut the pork into thin slices. Carefully cut the eggs in half, bearing in mind the yolks should still be fairly liquid. Put all of these within easy reach of the hob, along with the chilli oil, sweetcorn and bamboo. Heat the broth and whisk the tare into it to dissolve. Cook the noodles according to packet instructions. When the broth is steaming, divide the noodles between bowls and pour over the broth. Top with the eggs, pork, spring onion tops, sweetcorn and bamboo, and a dollop of chilli oil to taste. Eat immediately. Toppings are very much up to you: sweetcorn and bamboo are traditional, but most vegetables, cooked as appropriate, will work. Plant-based eaters might like some wobbly tofu in there instead of the egg, some sauteed mushrooms or indeed their favourite meat substitute in place of the pork – a few strips of seitan spring to mind.

3/9/2022,"An Indigenous nation is turning to a novel legal tactic in the hopes that it can save a beleaguered salmon population: it is suing on the salmon’s behalf, alleging that dams preventing it from migrating are a violation of the fish’s “inherent rights to exist, flourish, regenerate, and evolve”. The lawsuit is part of the growing “rights of nature” movement, a legal theory that seeks to give natural entities, like rivers or plants or animals, similar legal rights to humans. The salmon, called TsuladxW in the Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe’s Lushootseed language, are named plaintiffs in the case. The dammed rivers in Washington state no longer provide enough salmon for the tribe to conduct all of their ceremonies, let alone feed their members, and scientists have determined that nearby dams are hurting the salmon population. The tribe is arguing that the dams are violating TsuladxW’s fourth amendment right to be free from illegal seizures and their due process rights. Jack Fiander, a tribal member and lawyer representing the tribe in the court case, said the tribe is forcing the owner of the three dams – the city of Seattle – and the courts to recognize rights that the tribe has always believed fish have. “People need to know that these are our laws and if you come into our territory and do things that affect us you should be familiar with our laws and show us respect,” Fiander said. “These tribal beliefs shouldn’t be ridiculed. They’re based on ancestral knowledge that shouldn’t be discounted.” The rights of nature movement has only recently gained traction in the United States. Ecuador granted legal rights to all natural beings in its constitution in 2008 and an Indian court gave legal personhood to two rivers, the Ganges and the Yamuna, in 2017. In the US, some local governments have attempted to pass laws that give legal rights to natural entities, like the City of Toledo granting a “Bill of Rights” to Lake Erie in 2019 (it was struck down by a federal judge a year later). But the American rights of nature movement has largely been driven by Native American attorneys and tribes like the White Earth Nation, a tribe located in Minnesota that passed a law in 2018 recognizing manoomin, a wild rice sacred to the tribe, as having inherent legal rights. Last summer, the tribe sued the Minnesota department of natural resources on behalf of the manoomin, arguing that a recent permit for a new natural gas pipeline violated the rice’s right to “exist and flourish”. Seattle’s public utility has asked a federal judge to dismiss the Sauk-Suiattle case, arguing that the city’s Skagit River dams are outside the tribe’s jurisdiction. The public utility declined to comment on the lawsuit but said in a statement to the Guardian that they “value our longstanding relationship with the Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe and continue to work closely with the Sauk-Suiattle and other Tribes on many issues related to hydropower operations, including protecting and strengthening fish populations”. Both the Minnesota pipeline and the Skagit River dams are already subject to extensive environmental regulations, but advocates for rights of nature say that these existing protections are inadequate because there is little recourse when regulators overlook or weaken the rules. For example, Seattle negotiated a 1995 deal with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that allows the city to damage salmon habitat by draining a portion of the Skagit River, even though the river’s salmon are listed in the Endangered Species Act. If salmon or the river had their own rights there would be a legal route to demand environmental justice anytime a regulator ignores protections, according to Elizabeth Kronk Warner, the dean of the SJ Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah. “People will ultimately bargain for and negotiate for something that might be in their best interest rather than the river’s best interest,” Kronk Warner said. “At the end of the day an individual acting in their individual capacity is just not going to be able to protect the rights of nature in the same way that the natural element can itself.” Seattle is currently negotiating a new license with the FERC that could last as long as 50 years. With wild salmon disappearing, Fiander said the Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe can no longer trust agencies like the FERC to protect their sacred fish. “You can’t count on that federal agency to do the right thing. They take into account business considerations and so using these other legal means is appropriate,” Fiander said. “What Seattle is doing could go on for 50 years and the salmon could be extinct within 10 or 15.”",News/US news,Not going with the flow: salmon ‘sue’ US city over harm to population,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/09/salmon-sue-us-seattle-harm-population
3/9/2022,"Grosse Freiheit (Great Freedom) is the name of the Fassbinder-ish gay bar in this film with a dungeon-style sex club beneath: director and co-writer Sebastian Meise leaves it to us to gauge the exact level of irony in his title. It is visited by Hans, to whom 36-year-old German actor Franz Rogowski brings his typically intense, coiled and opaque personality. It is 1969, just after the West German government has decriminalised gay sex. Hans, recently out of jail for this crime, wanders the subterranean sex-filled corridors with an unfathomable smile. Perhaps he sees their resemblance to prison, whose interiors themselves resemble the public lavatories where Hans broke the law, that prison to which lifer Hans had an institutionalised loyalty, part of the lost generations of gay men whose entire lives were pointlessly consumed. Great Freedom is a formidably intelligent and well-acted prison movie and also a love story – or perhaps a paradoxically platonic bromance, stretching from the end of the second world war to the moon landing. Hans had been sent to the concentration camps in wartime and in 1945 finds himself back in prison with his number tattooed on his arm. Throughout the film, his civilian existence – his non-prison life – is mostly a mystery. We don’t know about his family or whatever jobs he’s been (briefly) doing. But we do know that he had a love affair with Oskar (Thomas Prenn) who is in prison with him in the 1950s. In the 60s, Hans has a prison moment with Leo (Anton von Lucke), the young teacher arrested with him in the toilet, and for whom Hans makes a self-sacrificial gesture to secure his freedom. Hans’s real relationship is with his cellmate, a stolid straight man called Viktor (Georg Friedrich), like Hans a recidivist veteran of the system who is initially overwhelmed with homophobic disgust at Hans, but then feels compassion on seeing his tattoo. As their friendship develops, Viktor (after glumly pondering his collection of straight porn) gruffly asks if Hans might, on what both men understand to be a strictly prison basis, attend to his personal needs. Poignantly, in fact tragically, both Viktor and Hans have a sense of themselves which is frozen in the 1940s: prison is for them their only life, certainly their only erotic life. Yet freedom, of a kind, has been available from within.

3/9/2022,"Bob Dylan will publish a new essay collection celebrating songs by peers such as Elvis Costello, Hank Williams and Nina Simone. Dylan began work on The Philosophy of Modern Song in 2010, according to a press release. His first book of new writing since 2004’s Chronicles: Volume One, it contains 60 essays in which the 80-year-old musician “analyses what he calls the trap of easy rhymes, breaks down how the addition of a single syllable can diminish a song, and even explains how bluegrass relates to heavy metal”. Publisher Simon & Schuster (S&S) described the essays as “mysterious and mercurial, poignant and profound, and often laugh-out-loud funny. And while they are ostensibly about music, they are really meditations and reflections on the human condition”. Combined with nearly 150 “carefully curated photos as well as a series of dreamlike riffs”, the collection “resembles an epic poem”, said S&S. Jonathan Karp, president and chief executive of S&S, said in a statement: “The Philosophy of Modern Song could only have been written by Bob Dylan. His voice is unique, and his work conveys his deep appreciation and understanding of songs, the people who bring those songs to life, and what songs mean to all of us.” Dylan won the Nobel prize in literature in 2016. His latest album, 2020’s Rough and Rowdy Ways, received mass critical acclaim and was placed highly in many publications’ end-of-year lists.

3/9/2022,"If you were to believe his recent tweets, poor Elon Musk is perhaps the world’s richest victim of bullying. In February, the chief executive of Tesla accused the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of harassing him and his company with “endless” investigations in retaliation for his vocal opinions of regulators. “The SEC seems to be targeting Mr Musk and Tesla for unrelenting investigation largely because Mr Musk remains an outspoken critic of the government,” Alex Spiro, a lawyer for the South African billionaire and his company wrote in a letter last month. The letter, filed to the US district judge who oversaw a previous settlement between Tesla and the SEC, said the agency’s “outsized efforts seem calculated to chill his exercise of First Amendment rights.” The accusations come as Musk faces increased scrutiny over his social media posts; allegations of worker discrimination and animal abuse at his companies; and recalls of Tesla vehicles. While the court will need to weigh in on whether Musk is indeed being unfairly targeted, it is undeniable that his companies have been slapped with a staggering number of legal and regulatory actions in recent months. Here are some of his biggest problems of late. All atwitter The letter Musk sent in February came days after Tesla disclosed it had been subpoenaed in November by the SEC. The agency has reportedly requested more information on Musk’s compliance with a 2018 settlement. That suit was filed after Musk tweeted in 2018 that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 per share – when, according to the SEC, he did not. As a result of the settlement, Musk and Tesla were required to pay $20m each in civil fines and Musk stepped down as chairman of the board. As part of the agreement, Musk would also need to submit any future tweets that may impact Tesla’s stock price to company lawyers for vetting. The new subpoena – filed just 10 days after Musk polled his Twitter followers on whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stake, triggering a sell-off – argues that has not been the case. Yesterday Musk asked a district judge to terminate the agreement and block the SEC’s subpoena. His lawyers said the 2018 consent decree resolving SEC securities fraud charges should not allow “roving and unbounded investigations” into the Tesla CEO, while impeding his constitutional right to free speech. “The SEC’s pursuit of Mr Musk has crossed the line into harassment, which is quintessential bad faith,” Musk’s lawyers wrote to US District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan. The tweeted poll sent Tesla shares falling and set off a new series of problems for Musk, including an investigation of him and his brother Kimbal Musk over insider-trading allegations. According to a filing, Kimbal sold $108m Tesla shares just days before Musk’s tweet, leading officials to investigate whether he was told about it in advance. In response, Musk tweeted that he was “building a case”. “I didn’t start the fight,” he said on Twitter, “but I will finish it.” These are not Musk’s only social media struggles: his Twitter account, which has 77m followers, has long been a source of drama. In 2019 he faced trial for defamation relating to tweets he made about a British cave diver; he was ultimately exonerated. In March 2021 an investor sued Musk and the company, accusing them of violating the SEC agreement regarding his tweets, and a second lawsuit was filed later in the year on behalf of a number of Tesla shareholders, who said Musk’s tweets had caused “billions of dollars in losses”. That suit also addresses Musk’s recent Twitter feud with Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat, which allegedly drove down the stock price another 9.6% in December. “Musk remains undeterred and continues to post on Twitter and social media on matters that are material to Tesla and its stockholders, and which ultimately have an impact on Tesla’s stock prices,” the suit says. Case in point Besides attempting to outrun attacks from financial regulators and investors, Musk is being targeted by his own employees over working conditions in Tesla factories and offices. Tesla was served in February with a comprehensive discrimination suit from California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing on behalf of dozens of workers in its flagship Fremont, California, plant. Experts say the lawsuit is likely to succeed and could result in structural changes to how the company works. (Tesla has called the action “misguided”.) It comes after a separate employee from the same plant was awarded $137m over racial discrimination – a settlement the company is still trying to have thrown out. “When a single worker sues Tesla, the company may be motivated to sweep the allegations under the rug. But here, the potential for actual, systemic change is much greater,” said Veena Dubal, labour law professor at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. Meanwhile six women have sued the company over sexual harassment in its factories, which two of them described as “rampant”. Actions-reactions Tesla is reportedly facing at least five lawsuits from customers who claim defective vehicles led to accidents. In February the family of a Florida man who died in a car accident filed a civil suit against the company, saying the suspension system in his Tesla vehicle failed and caused the fatal crash. In a separate lawsuit filed in February, another Tesla customer claimed that the defective self-driving technology on his Tesla Model 3 caused the vehicle to run into a stationary fire truck, killing his wife. That complaint said the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is aware of at least 12 incidents in which Tesla’s software failed to react to emergency vehicles with flashing lights. Musk has previously tweeted: “Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle.” In late 2021 and early 2022 Tesla issued 10 US recalls over four months, some under pressure from the NHTSA. What will actually come of this? While the list of legal actions taken against Musk and Tesla grows almost unbelievably long, the company’s bottom line has shown shockingly limited response, posting record profits in recent earnings reports. The company’s recent success in the face of both legal difficulties and industry-wide struggles with supply chain concerns and shortage show Tesla’s resilience, said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com. “With Tesla in high-growth mode and producing record earnings, investors will ignore the latest regulatory action at this initial stage unless it snowballs into something more significant,” he said. Dominating the tech discourse this week is, of course, the conflict in Ukraine: how it is being observed through our screens and what role tech giants should play in regulating that content. Misinformation expert Jane Lytvynenko wrote for the Guardian about citizen diplomacy and the growing trend of Ukrainian citizens fighting Russian disinformation with their own social media documentation of the issues and on-the-ground news. And social media use has never been more widespread during a conflict, putting users in a unique position to witness horrifying international events in real time. This piece in Vanity Fair explores the strange phenomenon – and its impact on how we process information. And here is an always relevant reminder that we do not need to tweet about everything.

3/9/2022,"The sound of the station piano drifts down the St Pancras International concourse, past the shops selling last-minute gifts before the Eurostar check-in. Nothing unusual there – but get closer and other sounds emerge: a clarinet, soprano and tenor, telling a post-pandemic story about reconnecting with the small pleasures of commuting. This was It’s the Little Things by the composer Rose Hall and librettist Katie Colombus, one of seven micro-operas written by all-female teams for the Royal Opera House, popping up around the station to mark International Women’s Day. Each had a bare handful of players and singers conducted by Yshani Perinpanayagam or Ellie Slorach and directed by Diane Page. The idea for the project – titled Lost and Found – had come from the Belgian chamber ensemble Casco Phil, who staged something similar last year in Antwerp and Brussels, and who provided the instrumentalists here. The pieces, though, were all new, themed to the venue and intended to draw in passing, unsuspecting audiences – which to some extent they did, although by definition people at a station rarely have time to stop and listen for long. That’s unless they are pathologically early like the anxious main character in The Hardest Journey, a miniature by composer Anna Braithwaite and librettist Kerry Priest in which with some deftly witty writing the voices of Siri, the station tannoy and a hungry child, plus some body percussion train noise effects, are provided by three male singers. Couple dynamics were treated in comic style in Mini-Break by Victoria Bernath and Teresa Howard or as a breakup in The Parting Place by Sarah Lianne Lewis and Sophia Chapadjiev. With each piece lasting only a few minutes, and with the performance spaces spread out around the station, works were performed two or three times in a row. Hearing things again immediately, often interpreted by different singers, made for some of the most satisfying listening. I Just Wanna Be (in Center Parcs), by Joanna Taylor and Kerry Priest, really needed two listens, once to enjoy the pointed complaining of the female character, against itchy percussion and violin backing, and once to listen to the drawn-out dreamings of her mismatched tenor partner. The same was true of Detritus, a sombre duet for bass and violin with music by Laura Reid and words by Oge Nwosu, a monologue on belonging delivered by a migrant station cleaner and apparently inspired by St Anthony of Padua – not that you needed to know that to be moved by it. Blaise Malaba was incisive, directly addressing members of the audience; Jamie Woollard was more reticent. Each interpretation made an impact. All 10 singers – all part of the ROH’s Jette Parker Young Artists Programme – impressed, and several stood out, including Malaba for magnetic presence, Siân Dicker for her knack for comedy, and April Koyejo-Audiger for a gloriously full-bodied soprano that it would be good to hear in a big role soon.",Arts/Music,Lost and Found review – micro-operas transport commuters as station becomes pop-up venue,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/09/lost-and-found-review-royal-opera-house-st-pancras-station-micro-operas-transport-commuters
3/9/2022,"The buck-passing between Poland and the US over the possible use of elderly MiG-29s to hit Russian forces inside Ukraine is one of the west’s few diplomatic failures of the past month. It also raises questions about how far European countries are prepared to escalate militarily before they believe they will touch a dangerous Russian tripwire. The US and Europe have worked hard to keep their differences over sanctions and oil embargos to a public minimum, and tried to accommodate each other’s national interests. So it was striking on Tuesday when first the Pentagon described a Polish offer to send plans to the US airbase in Mannheim as “untenable”, then the deputy US secretary of state said the US had not been consulted about the plan. Part of the problem was that the Polish proposal was subtly but critically different to a scheme that had been previously discussed in private. Against the backdrop of highly charged diplomatic tensions, presentation matters. In essence Poland said it would cooperate in strengthening the Ukrainian air force so long as this would be seen in Moscow as a US, Nato or EU scheme, but not a Polish one. In its original US-conceived iteration, the proposal was a trilateral deal whereby Poland would hand over the MiGs to Ukrainian pilots to fly into their homeland, and the US would then provide some substitute planes. Boris Johnson, an enthusiast, described the plan as “rent a MiG”. That proposal, arguably, was not qualitatively different to Nato members providing Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank missiles. In return, Poland would eventually fill the hole in its air force with 28 F-16s being provided by the US. But under private pressure from the US, Poland felt the plan unduly exposed its citizens to Putin’s ire. So instead, in a game of diplomatic pass the parcel, Poland tweaked the proposals so the planes would be sent free of charge to the US airbase in Ramstein, Germany, rather than being flown out of Poland into Ukraine. The move would literally take Poland out of the line of Russia’s fire since the plan could be labelled as that of the US, Nato or the EU. Poland also suggested other frontline Nato countries with MiG planes should match its plan, a proposal directed at Slovakia and Romania. If executed it would mean Ukraine had 70 extra planes at its disposal. The Pentagon’s response – “it is simply not clear to us that there is a tangible justification for this” – was swift. Passing the parcel back, it said any decision to hand over planes ultimately rested with the Polish government, although it did not kill off the proposal altogether. It is possible that Poland’s nationalist government launched its plan with the aim of relieving pressure from the US Congress and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, knowing full well it would be rejected. Either way the public spat is a setback. Over the weekend, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, had said a plan involving planes was under active consideration. The upshot after this mini-debacle is Russia retains air superiority. Ukrainian pilots who were being trained in Poland to fly the planes are now grounded with no machines with which to defend their country. An opportunity has been squandered. The episode may have lessons for both sides. The possibility of making the MiG-29s available first appeared publicly on 27 February, when the EU made the unprecedented decision to provide military aid to a country outside the bloc. The first tranche of equipment for Ukraine is expected to amount to €500m (£417m), but up to €5bn is to be spent under the European Peace Initiative. It was then that the head of EU diplomacy, Josep Borrell, said that aid for Kyiv would also include offensive weapons, including planes. At that point it became clear that the planes would either only be MIG-29 and Su-25, because Ukrainian pilots only have experience with these machines. Poland, it would seem, did not appreciate the issue being disclosed. However, the country has emerged strengthened in another way from the past 24 hours. The US has provided Poland with two Patriot defence missiles. Each battery consists of two firing platoons with two launchers. This means there will be 16 launchers in Poland. They can have either four or six missiles. The latest Pac-3 MSE missiles are capable of shooting down the Russian Iskander ballistic and manoeuvring missiles. Unfortunately, they are also the anti-aircraft defence that Ukraine lacks. Nato, as its constitution requires, looks after its own.",News/World news,Clash between Poland and US over MiG-29s reveals tensions in escalating war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/clash-over-poland-and-us-missile-plans-reveals-tensions-in-escalating-war
3/9/2022,"On 3 March, the last remaining independent TV channel in Russia, Dozhd – or TV Rain in English – stopped broadcasting. Over the past year, journalists’ few remaining freedoms in Russia have been evaporating, with the censors tightening their iron grip, and last week they finally reached their ultimate goal. This sounds dramatic, but I believe that the era of independent media in Russia has ended. The free press is officially and legally over for now. I hosted a news show on Dozhd called Here and Now. We’ve been broadcasting since 2010, and we’ve been through tough times before. During the poisoning and later arrest of Alexei Navalny – and the subsequent protests – in 2020 and 2021, we totalled 1.1bn views through our streaming and YouTube channels. Despite being thrown out of the Kremlin journalist pool, and being branded “a foreign agent” by the justice ministry, we were proud to stay on air and reach millions during those historic times. Still, the war in Ukraine came as a shock to all of us. It was announced by Vladimir Putin on state TV at 5am. Like the beginning of the great patriotic war after the Nazis bombed Kyiv, there was no formal declaration: it was called only a “special military operation”. After the initial shock, we broadcast on air 24/7; many of us slept in the office. We are a small team, but we all felt the historic importance of the endeavour – the need and demand for objective and independent information for the public. We told the truth from the beginning: we called it a war (this terminology was later banned by the censors). We ran segments saying what was really happening in Ukraine. I interviewed Ukrainian officials and journalists, and ordinary people in Kyiv, Mariupol, Lviv and other cities as they were being bombed by the Russian military. This sort of thing would never appear on state TV. It felt as if we really were the powerful free press of Russia. On YouTube we were getting 10-25m views a day. In some ways I’ve never felt more invigorated than during that excruciating first week. But it rapidly became too dangerous to continue. A law introducing a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison for spreading “fake news” about the actions of Russian soldiers came into effect on 4 March. This, in effect, left us with the Russian defence ministry as the only remaining legal source of information on the war, and it was still denying any civilian casualties – and reporting very few military losses. At the same time, the prosecutor general’s office started qualifying any financial or strategic help to Ukrainian residents as treason, punishable by a 20-year prison sentence – absurdly, even an interview with a Ukrainian journalist could theoretically be considered treason now. This raised the stakes too high; it effectively made true journalism too risky to pursue in Russia. Last Thursday we were forced to close down, hours before the law came into effect, in order to protect our team from inevitable persecution. It’s temporary, we hope, as all of us are willing to find ways to continue working in some shape or form. “It’s not the end of the show, only of a season – to be continued,” were the parting words of Natalya Sindeyeva, our co-founder and CEO. Sindeyeva and Tikhon Dzyadko, our editor-in-chief, exhibited a heroic work ethic and inspirational leadership during the final weeks of Dozhd. Since then, the situation for the press has deteriorated further. Facebook and Twitter have already been blocked and it’s only a matter of days until YouTube follows. The great Russian firewall is being built, brick by brick in front of our eyes, leading to complete isolation from the outer world. The iron curtain is returning, reminding us of the Soviet times so dear to Putin’s heart – but something tells me that USSR 2.0 will be an even eerier place than its ill-fated predecessor. Like a dark and absurd Coen brothers creation, this will not be a country for journalists old or young. Modern Russia as we know it is coming to an end. It’s not only Ukraine that Putin is bombarding right now, but Russia too – its culture, its heritage, its civilisation. Expecting the worst, on Sunday I made the most difficult decision of my life and boarded the last Aeroflot flight allowed to land in the EU. Just like in 1922 when intellectuals fled the newly established Soviet Union on board the “philosophers’ ships”, hundreds of Russian independent journalists, politicians, artists and public intellectuals have now relocated to Europe with flights landing in Georgia, Latvia and Armenia among others. I will pursue journalistic work in France, a country I have long admired for its values and principles. I am writing a letter directly to Emmanuel Macron, who showed courage and persistence in attempting to counter Russia’s aggression, to request permission to work. Living through all this, the theory I hold to is that Russia is not fighting Ukraine, but rather Putin himself is. It is his revenge for the democratic transition it embarked upon, and its turn towards Europe. Putin hates this, and so he also attempts to erase the signs of Russian Europeanisation. Political debate, the free press: it is all part of the battlefield. But I am still convinced that Russia is Europe, even as it temporarily diverges from its path in the most criminal way possible. We will end up back on course, and not even Putin with his bombs can prevent this from happening. We will continue the spirit of the free press embodied by Dozhd, by that name or another, from abroad if we have to. And one day, both Russia and Ukraine, alongside each other yet independently, will become fully integrated peaceful members of Europe and will be seen as such. We work towards that.
