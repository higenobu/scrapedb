3/8/2022,"One of the things people often say when they see a colourised photo from the past is how vividly it brings history to life. The type of historical images we are more accustomed – and perhaps more inured – to seeing in monochrome are made breathtakingly new in colour, and this or that photo from the second world war is given such immediacy that it feels like something more relatable from our present. Yet for the first time yesterday, I saw the technique work in the other direction. When an image of the vast and desperate crowds at Kharkiv train station was flying around, an ITN cameraman posted the same picture but in black and white, and it instantly felt 10 times more arresting. Happening right now was a tableau straight from Europe’s dark past – thousands of tightly packed people massed on a station platform and trying to flee, vastly outnumbering the available train space. Perhaps we know best how to read this picture when we literally see it in black and white. Nearly 1,700 miles away in Calais, alas, another image surfaces. This is a piece of printer paper taped to a wall, perhaps by some cursed emissary of the British home office, which reads: NO VISAS DELIVERED IN CALAIS. For the exhausted Ukrainians who find it, two sparse instructions follow: 1. Type in a long and unwieldy URL to fill in a form. 2. Go all the way to Paris or Brussels to apply for a visa. Why are we like this? In the words Alf Dubs, who arrived in the UK on the Kindertransport in 1939: “Shouldn’t we be ashamed of ourselves?” Why – yet again – does the Home Office respond to a crisis in a manner that appears to run the full gamut from nasty to useless? Contrary to all manner of contradictory spin from No 10 and the home secretary, “world-leading”, “tailored” and “bespoke” solutions and innovations are not making things easier for Ukrainians in their time of need. Instead, the inevitable humanitarian crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine seems to have taken those who should have known better by surprise. Boris Johnson’s administration is tough on war but weak on what we know is its timeworn fallout. At the time it was reported that Poland had taken 800,000 refugees, the UK had accepted a mere 50. Which, to put things into perspective, is half the number of people you’d invite to a Downing Street bring-your-own-bottle party in the middle of a lockdown. Outraged by this dated inaccuracy, the Home Office yesterday corrected the record to show that a whole 300 visas had now been granted to fleeing Ukrainians. Which is three BYOB guestlists, and a mere 2.7% of the number of refugees who arrived in Berlin last Friday alone. The UK is reduced to preposterous sleights of hand, attempting to make a virtue of what amount to bars to entry. Yesterday the Home Office was trumpeting having “the first visa scheme in the world” to launch post-invasion, studiously ignoring the huge number of countries that have waived the need for visas entirely to tackle the crisis. “I am not going to be drawn into this,” breezed Foreign Office minister James Cleverly. “Because really this is a team sport, and we’re pulling together as a team on this.” The numbers indicate we’re not. We’re letting other countries do the pulling together while we sit in the boat and pontificate about the view. Shambles is the kinder reading. The suspicion is that the system is functioning as designed – that these things are not happening to the Home Office and the government of which it is part, but because of them. Both No 10 and the Foreign Office slapped down Priti Patel’s mooted plan to open easier access for all those fleeing Ukraine. Fellow secretaries of state either offer pointed assistance to the Home Office or wash their hands of its operations. This morning Ben Wallace volunteered Ministry of Defence personnel support; yesterday Liz Truss sniffed: “It’s really a matter for the home secretary exactly how the visa process works.” Can one of them – any of them – just get it together on this front? In the years and decades after the second world war, many nations in Europe and beyond looked back on their actions and came to the painful realisation that they could and should have done more in various ways, not least in accepting refugees. As images of exodus are now reminding us, history is never in the past. History is now. It will be to our enduring shame if we don’t try much harder to be on the right side of it.

3/8/2022,"President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s speech by video link to the European parliament last week was so powerful it brought the English translator to the verge of tears. “Prove you are with us,” he said to leading EU politicians, a clear and emotive call for greater support that he is expected to replicate in Westminster today. The Russian invasion has already turned the khaki-wearing Ukrainian leader into the most powerful – and effective – political communicator in the world. The addresses from his office in Kyiv are designed to shift political and public opinion, and they have already had a dramatic impact. A private speech to EU leaders a few days earlier is credited with helping bring forward tougher than expected sanctions on Russia from Brussels. In that address he told the gathered presidents and prime ministers he believed his life was under threat, and from their relative safety in the Belgian capital, the continent’s leading politicians felt they had little choice but to step up. Zelenskiy may have got his tough sanctions but they have not turned the tide in the war. Despite a chaotic and messy start, Russian forces continue to menace Kyiv and analysts at the Institute of the Study of War believe the start of attack on the capital could be 24 to 96 hours away. What the Ukrainians want immediately is greater military support from the west, as demonstrated by another speech from the president – a private video address made to 280 members of the US Congress on Saturday. One of those listening was Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, who said Zelenskiy “made a desperate plea” for the implementation of a no-fly zone – or failing that more fighter planes and other advanced military aid. Ukrainian officials told the Guardian he is expected to make similar remarks to the House of Commons on Tuesday (although his speeches tend to be extemporised, so it is hard to be certain: “I don’t read off the paper off this sheet because the paper phase in the life of my country is ended,” he told the European parliament). But that may not be what the British government wants to hear. Boris Johnson is expected be in the Commons when Zelenskiy speaks. But he, in common with other Nato allies, has made clear he does not support a no-fly zone, partly because it is feared that it could lead to a general war with Russia. “When it comes to a no-fly zone in the skies above Ukraine, we have to accept the reality of that involves shooting down Russian planes,” the prime minister said last week. It may depend therefore on how Zelenskiy pitches his request. If Ukraine’s leader pivots, as he appeared to on Saturday, from asking for a no-fly zone towards an alternative demand for greater military aid, it could be effective. That would start with a call for Poland and other eastern European countries to supply Russian made fighter jets of the type Ukraine’s pilots know how to fly. Britain’s role here would be both to help persuade eastern European countries to part with their MiG-29s or similar and help provide replacement air support, and other more capable arms, such as air defence systems – all likely to be needed in the defence of Kyiv. The risk for Britain and the west is that greater rearmament will further provoke Russia, but facing a national existential crisis, Zelenskiy has no time to worry about that when he addresses MPs today.",News/World news,What can Zelenskiy expect as he prepares to address the Commons?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/what-can-zelenskiy-expect-as-he-prepares-to-address-the-commons
3/8/2022,"Book now It’s entirely untrue that in order to write a memoir, you need to be a former president, a key player in or witness to a historical event, or a reality TV star. Some of the most poignant, moving and funny memoirs have been written by people who held the belief that they had something interesting to say, and that there might be an audience for it. The process itself begins with an idea - and this is the easy part, since it’s most likely an idea born from your personal experiences. But how do you develop those ideas into an angle that will make people want to keep reading? This weekend masterclass with Gavin Evans builds on his short memoir-writing class, to invite you to dig a little deeper. Over the two days, you will learn how to expand the seed of your idea into one sentence, and then one page. Drawing on the work of other memoir writers, you will also explore the technical aspects of form and style, voice and tone, and tense. Gavin will also take you through how to structure your work into chapters, and you will have the opportunity to receive personal feedback on your writing from Gavin.

3/8/2022,"This documentary about school life brought back happy memories of Nicolas Philibert’s classic Etre et Avoir from a generation ago, about a gentle teacher in rural France helping his infants understand the meaning of life. Kevin McArevey is the dynamic headteacher of Holy Cross Boys’ primary school in north Belfast, in a community once scarred by the Troubles. Mr McArevey loves Elvis, martial arts – and classical philosophy. For his nine-and 10-year-olds, he has introduced lessons with maxims from the great thinkers of Ancient Greece as talking points, and he is using these lessons as a way of learning new modes of thinking, strategies to defuse violence and head off confrontation, and it culminates with his bold plan to put up a big new mural on the streets: not the traditional icons of sectarianism, but Plato, Socrates and Aristotle. It hardly needs to be said that McArevey believes Belfast’s men of violence learned their mindset in the school playground (maybe some learned it in his own school playground) so he wants to plant something new. This is an open and good-natured film, with some great setpiece scenes with poignant closeups on kids’ faces as they ponder why they are so angry and what can be done about it (although I have to admit I found myself thinking about the classic classroom scene from the TV comedy Derry Girls about what Catholics and Protestants have in common). In some ways, this is a film about the “Dr Jekyll” side of the school: the rational disavowal of violence and genuine demonstrations of penitence that follow the “Mr Hyde” flashes of violence that inevitably happen off camera, and so the effect is sometimes, perhaps not entirely intentionally, one of dysfunction. But the school is no more dysfunctional than any other institution and a lot more intelligent and self-questioning than many. A very engaging film.  Young Plato is released on 11 March in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Young Plato review – Belfast headteacher inspires playground philosophers,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/08/young-plato-review-belfast-headteacher-inspires-playground-thinkers
3/8/2022,"Aweek ago, Masouma Tajik found herself running for her life for the second time in six months. Evacuated from Kabul after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, she was now fleeing another country in another continent, this time to escape Russian bombs and bullets. A software engineer and data analyst, 23-year-old Tajik says the shock and trauma of finding herself in another war zone has shaken her sense of reality. “Sometimes, when I close my eyes, everything seems surreal,” she says, from the Polish capital Warsaw where she has finally found a place of relative safety. “When I was on my way to the Polish border from Lviv, I saw scenes which took me back to my evacuation in Kabul. Every time I saw these scenes, I felt deja vu. I had the feeling I had lived through this before. I couldn’t believe that. I left my family and friends in Afghanistan a few months before, and I was now leaving my friends in Ukraine.” War and conflict have followed her since birth. She was born a refugee in Tehran, after her family, who are Hazara, an ethnic minority persecuted in Afghanistan, were forced to leave their home. After the family returned, and despite all the obstacles stacked against her because of her gender and ethnicity, she managed to win a scholarship to the American University of Afghanistan and became one of the top students in her class. Last August, Tajik was studying and living in Kabul when the Taliban arrived at the gates of the city on 14 August. Within 24 hours, thousands of Afghans who once felt protected by the Afghan National Army and the US military found themselves living under Taliban law. As a Hazara and a professional woman, Tajik was a target. “My boss called me to tell me that I had to leave the city and that he had found a way to get us out,” she says. Along with thousands of other desperate Afghans she managed to make it to Kabul airport where a chaotic evacuation effort was under way. “When we entered the airport, the situation was getting worse. The case was dire, with the Taliban beating people on the run. I was whipped by a group of Taliban. I was terrified.” After days of waiting, on 21 August, Tajik, carrying only a backpack containing a laptop and Elif Shafak’s book The Forty Rules of Love, managed to find a seat on a plane bound for Kyiv. Alone in a strange city with a different language and living as a refugee, she began to try to rebuild her life. “After a few months, I found myself jobless because the company I worked for was closing down,” she says. “But I didn’t give up and got another remote job as a data analyst for a Serbian company.” Six months later, as Tajik was starting to make friends, her life imploded without warning, once more. On 24 February, Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine and head for Kyiv, which was hit by the first airstrikes soon after. For Tajik, it was time to escape again. “I started to think, is there any country where there is no war, so I can go there?” says Tajik, with tears running down her face. “And why, among all the people in the world, why me? Why can’t I just have a normal life like that of any other 23-year-old girl in Europe?” Tajik managed to reach Lviv where she got in touch with a group of Polish volunteers on Facebook, who crossed the border into Ukraine to bring her to safety in Poland. “Before leaving, I wasn’t eating and drinking just to save the little money I had – in order to save myself,” she says. Tajik arrived in Warsaw last Thursday and was reunited with an Afghan friend from Kabul who has been living in Poland since the Taliban takeover. She now faces the prospect of having to start her life over again for the third time. “This time, I will live each day as it comes,” she says. “Because if I have learned one thing from life in these six months, it is that we really do not know what tomorrow has in store for us.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,From Taliban bullets to Russian bombs: war chases Afghan refugee across Europe,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/08/from-taliban-bullets-to-russian-bombs-war-chases-afghan-refugee-across-europe
3/8/2022,"What are the best recipes for using the whole of a citrus fruit?Jon, London E11 The most famous, of course, is Claudia Roden’s zero-waste orange and almond cake, and rightly so. She boils a couple of oranges in water until super soft, then cuts them open (discarding the seeds) and purees in a food processor. This is then added to a batter of eggs, caster sugar, baking powder and ground almonds, poured into a greased and floured tin and baked. The result is wonderfully moist, so if you haven’t tried this, Jon, it should be your first port of call. Georgina Hayden, whose latest book Nistisima is released this month, also boils an orange for portokalopita, AKA her “all-time favourite way of using whole citrus – skin, pith and all”. For this orange filo pie, Hayden blitzes the boiled orange with yoghurt, eggs and sugar. “This custard is baked into finely shredded filo, which creates a light and interesting, sponge-like texture. It’s then drenched in a spiced orange sugar syrup and left to cool.” Roden has a penchant for boiling lemons, too. In her latest book, Med, she cuts them into pieces (pips discarded) and nestles them between chicken thighs (which have been coated in olive oil, lemon juice, turmeric, ginger, honey, white wine and chopped garlic) on a roasting tray. She adds capers and olives, pours over the remaining oil/lemon mix (used for the chicken), and roasts. Boiling is also a good tactic for spent shells, says Douglas McMaster, chef-owner of Silo, the zero-waste restaurant in east London. “We blanch them to death in water – about six or seven times – to take away the tannic bitterness, then blend with sugar.” You’ll end up with an “incredible floral, bitter-sweet” lemon pith sauce that pairs beautifully with shellfish, brown crab (or any fish, really) or radicchio. Peter Sanchez-Iglesias, chef-owner of Casamia and Paco Tapas in Bristol and Decimo in London, does likewise but with a slightly different method: “Add the same weight of water and sugar as you have leftover fruit, boil it and blend.” Eaten on yoghurt for breakfast, it is simply the zest (sorry). If you have spare lemon juice or zest knocking about, Martyn Lyons, head chef at Toklas in London, turns them into curd (“for use in tarts, ice-creams or to dunk shortbread into”), while Hayden adds the latter to avgolemoni (“a Greek chicken and rice soup in which the broth is thickened with a mixture of egg and lemon”). Shaun Hurrell, chef-owner of Barrio Comida in Durham, meanwhile, uses lime juice in ceviche or turns the whole fruit into the Mexican sweet, limones rellenos de coco (or coconut-stuffed limes). “Boil limes in sugar syrup, scoop out the insides, then return the shells to the pan.” Stuff the candied shells with softened, shredded coconut. Pickles and preserves are also ripe for the picking – don’t be afraid to mix and match fruits in, say, marmalades. “We preserve Marrakesh lemons by packing them in rock salt,” says Lyons, who also does the same to oranges and mandarins. “Both add a lovely, savoury perfume to soups, stews and braises.” Or blitz them into dressings or aïoli, or add the sliced zest to salads and carpaccio to put a pep in your step.

3/8/2022,"The shockwaves from the Russian invasion of Ukraine will cut UK living standards by £2,500 per person, lead to more persistent inflationary pressure and slow the economy to a standstill next year, economists fear. Following reports of an escalation of the west’s economic measures against the Kremlin, forecasters have cut their estimates of growth in 2022 and 2023 and become gloomier about the outlook for the cost of living. The Centre for Economics and Business Research consultancy said the prospect of living standards taking their biggest hit since records began in 1955 would put pressure on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to announce fresh help in his spring statement on 23 March. Based on the assumption that sanctions would have a marked impact on global commodity prices and inflation, the CEBR said growth this year would be halved – down from a previously forecast 4.2% in 2022 to 1.9%. Its growth estimate for 2023 has been reduced from 2.0% to 0.0%, while after peaking at 8.7% in the spring, inflation is expected to remain above 7% until early 2023. “As a result of higher commodity prices, we estimate that disposable incomes will fall in 2022 by 4.8% with a further fall of 1.4% in 2023. The forecast fall in living standards this year is an estimated £71bn – which amounts to £2,553 per household. As a result, we estimate that disposable incomes will fall in 2022 by 4.8% with a further fall of 1.4% in 2023. The fall in 2022 is the largest since records started in 1955.” The chancellor is not currently planning on making his spring statement a mini-budget but the CEBR said he was “likely to be under further pressure to put the economy on a semi wartime setting on 23 March”. James Smith, developed market economist at ING bank, said: “The war in Ukraine and the associated spike in energy costs means a growing risk that the UK will enter a consumer spending downturn. It’s early days, but we have revised downwards our forecasts, and quarterly growth rates are likely to hit zero later this year. [We] will likely see inflation peak close to 8% in April and end the year near to 6%.” Paul Dales, UK economist at Capital Economics, said he now expected inflation to peak at 8.3% in April – up from 8% previously – and be at 6.6% in December rather than 4.6% as previously expected.",News/Business,"Russia sanctions ‘to cut UK living standards by £2,500 a person’",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/08/russia-sanctions-to-cut-uk-living-standards-by-2500-a-person
3/8/2022,"A Russian governor in Siberia has been confronted by angry citizens who blamed him for deploying a local riot police unit to Ukraine to become “cannon fodder”, a video clip circulating online showed. The footage, first posted by Radio Free Europe (RFE) on Monday, showed a fiery exchange between Sergei Tsivilyov, the governor of the Kemerovo region, and people in the city of Novokuznetsk. “They lied to everyone, they deceived everyone … Why did you send them there?” one woman asks Tsivilyov, saying that the soldiers thought they were going for military drills in Belarus. “They didn’t know their objective … They were sent as cannon fodder,” the woman adds. The governor would not have been responsible for the decision to deploy the unit, which would have been made by the country’s national guard, a separate internal military force directly subordinated to the president, Vladimir Putin. According to RFE, the confrontation took place on Saturday at the gymnasium of the training base for riot police units, some of whose officers were killed or captured in Ukraine. As the fighting in Ukraine nears its third week, more and more relatives of killed and captured Russian soldiers have expressed their opposition to the war, saying their loved ones were not told in advance about the country’s plans to invade Ukraine. Videos of captured Russian soldiers issued by the Ukrainians also appear to show that Russian troops were not informed of the invasion until the very end. Western military experts have raised questions about Russian troops’ morale and preparedness in Ukraine, which could explain why Moscow’s blitzkrieg plan to overwhelm Ukraine and take Kyiv has so far failed. Russia has revealed very little information about the state of its soldiers fighting in Ukraine. Last week, Russia’s defence ministry said that 498 Russian soldiers had died in Ukraine. Ukraine’s military claimed on Sunday that more than 11,000 Russian troops had been killed since the invasion of Ukraine began. In the video, Tsivilyov defended the invasion, saying that Russia’s actions in Ukraine “shouldn’t be criticised”. “Look, you can shout and blame everyone right now, but I think that, while a military operation is in process, one shouldn’t make any conclusions,” Tsivilyov said. Russian officials, as well as state media, have been referring to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a “special military operation” rather than a “war” or “invasion”. Authorities have also introduced a number of new laws aimed at stifling public opposition to the war. On Friday, Putin signed into law a bill that introduced jail terms of up to 15 years for fake news about the Russian army, forcing many Russian and international outlets to cease their coverage of the events. And while the authorities have been successful at getting a large segment of the population behind its war efforts, videos such as the Novokuznetsk footage circulating online suggest the war is deeply unpopular among those who have lost friends and relatives in Ukraine. The Guardian previously spoke to family members of a Russian sniper captured in Ukraine, who similarly expressed anger and shock about their relative’s involvement in the war. “Young boys are thrown like cannon fodder, and most importantly for what? For palaces in Gelendzhik?” the close family member of the captured sniper Leonid Paktishev said, referring to the palatial mansion on the Black Sea that Russian independent journalists have said is linked to Putin.",News/World news,‘They were sent as cannon fodder’: Siberian governor confronted by relatives of Russian unit,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/they-were-sent-as-cannon-fodder-siberian-governor-confronted-by-relatives-of-russian-unit
3/8/2022,"Coco Chanel borrowed her first tweed jacket from the Duke of Westminster, her lover, in 1924; within a year she had made the look her own, with a tweed skirt suit appearing in her Paris collection for the first time. In true showbiz style, Paris fashion week ended with one of its greatest hits. A Chanel show in homage to the iconic tweed suit was a surefire crowd pleaser. Clutching the squares of pink tweed sent out as invitations, guests sat on tweed-upholstered seats to view a pageant of tweed dresses, coats and suits. If it was possible to sing along with a catwalk show, the audience would have known all the words. The designer Virginie Viard said she had been thinking about Coco Chanel who, on walks in the Scottish countryside, would gather ferns, flowers and heathers to use as the blueprint for her next collection’s colour palette. This season, Coco came with a generous side order of Kristen Stewart as Diana, Princess of Wales in Pablo Larran’s recent film Spencer. The bright tweeds on the runway, worn with short skirts and baubled with gilt buttons, recalled the opening scene in which Stewart, whose on-screen wardrobe was made by Chanel, runs across a muddy English field in a tartan tweed blazer and gobstopper pearl earrings. When Karl Lagerfeld was at the helm, every Chanel show was a 15-minute fashion funfair ride – guests were immersed in a spaceship launchpad one season, a Parisian bistro the next. Since taking over in 2019, Viard’s shows have been subtle and restrained in comparison. Her designs have proved a hit with consumers, with a bullish average price increase of 71% in three years on handbags reflecting a confident mood at Chanel. This lighthearted show – with jokey touches such as chain-strapped mini hip flasks, and double-C logo wellies and galoshes – saw Viard edge closer to Lagerfeld-era showmanship. The war in Ukraine has continued to redraw alliances within the fashion industry as it emerged that a Russian designer had been dropped from the Paris fashion week schedule, while the high street retailer Uniqlo announced its intention to keep all 50 stores in Russia open. Valentin Yudashkin’s digital show was removed from the official Paris fashion week programme after the designer refused to break his silence over the war. In 2008, Yudashkin, who came to prominence in the 1980s dressing Raisa Gorbachev, designed new uniforms for the Russian army, although Ralph Toledano, the president of the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode said that this was not a decisive factor in the decision. “We have nothing against the Russian people, but we will not support or accept to have in our calendar those who support his [Putin’s] position,” Toledano told Women’s Wear Daily, describing Yudashkin as “an affiliate of the regime”. Against an exodus of fashion brands from Russia, Uniqlo bucked the trend by announcing its intention to keep trading in the country. Tadashi Yanai, the CEO of Japan’s Fast Retailing, the parent company to Uniqlo, said: “Clothing is a necessity of life. The people of Russia have the same right to live as we do.” Yanai said that he was opposed to the war, but that business decisions should not be politically motivated. The decision runs counter to a wave of fashion businesses, including Fast Retailing’s Spanish-based competitor Inditex, who have exited Russia in recent days.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Chanel leaves Paris fashion crowd pleased with tweeds,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/08/chanel-leaves-paris-fashion-crowd-pleased-with-tweeds
