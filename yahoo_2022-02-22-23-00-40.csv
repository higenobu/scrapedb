2/22/2022,"Since the days of President Jimmy Carter and the 1970s oil crisis, the United States has relentlessly pursued the utopia of energy independence. Indeed, energy independence is a worthy pursuit that both Democrats and Republicans readily agree upon. After all, relying on other countries for oil, natural gas or coal is an inherently risky proposition since It can lead to wars, or compromise the country’s relationships with foreign powers. The notion that the country could become self-sufficient by producing enough energy to sustain the entirety of its population and industries was first floated by Nixon when he declared war on foreign oil during the oil crisis of the 1970s. It was later popularized by Bush in a state of the union address in February 2006 when he decried United States’ addiction to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts of the world before announcing plans to break this addiction by developing several alternatives, including a multibillion-dollar subsidized ramp-up of biofuels. Bush went on to boldly declare that by 2025, America would “...make our dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing of the past” by cutting imports from Gulf states by three-quarters. Well, it turns out the former president was prescient on some key predictions, which in hindsight appears quite remarkable when you consider that back then, the shale industry was barely on its feet. The revelation that the U.S. is currently producing more energy than it consumes suggests that America has finally achieved the seemingly elusive goal of producing enough fuels to avoid relying on the rest of the world. Net Energy Exporter According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the United States was a net energy exporter in 2019 and 2020. EIA notes that total U.S. annual primary energy net imports (imports minus exports) generally increased in most years since the mid-1950s, reaching a record high in 2005, equal to about 30% of total U.S. energy consumption. Since 2005, total annual energy imports have gradually decreased while total energy exports have increased. The United States became a net total energy exporter in 2019 for the first time since 1952, and maintained that position in 2020 even though both total energy production and consumption were lower in 2020 than in 2019. Total U.S. energy exports exceeded total energy imports by 3.46 quadrillion British thermal units (quads) in 2020, the largest margin on record. U.S. energy exports in 2020 totaled 23.47 quads, and energy imports fell 13% to 20.0 quads, the lowest level since 1992. Crude oil accounts for the largest share of U.S. energy imports on an energy content basis. Even though the United States remained a net importer of crude oil in 2020, crude oil net imports were at the lowest level since 1985. Moreover, some of the imported crude oil is refined into products that are exported. Source: EIA Despite a 4% drop in domestic crude oil production in 2020 from 2019, U.S. crude oil net imports in 2020 were the lowest since 1985. U.S. total annual crude oil exports have increased every year since 2010 and reached a record high in 2020 of about 3.18 million barrels per day (b/d). U.S. crude oil imports fell to about 5.88 million b/d in 2020. U.S. petroleum products (excluding crude oil) imports and exports declined in 2020 from 2019: imports by 15% and exports by 5%. However, total annual petroleum products exports in 2020 were the third highest on record behind 2019 and 2018. Propane was the most-exported petroleum product in 2020, followed by distillate fuel oil. Gross exports of natural gas have increased every year since 2014, and in 2017, the United States became a net exporter of natural gas for the first time since the late 1950s. In 2020, natural gas gross exports reached a record high of 14.43 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), and gross imports of natural gas fell to 6.99 Bcf/d, the lowest level since 1993. Increases in domestic natural gas production and increases in liquefied natural gas (LNG) export capacity have contributed to growth in natural gas exports. Trade volumes of coal and other fuels account for relatively small shares of U.S. total energy trade. U.S. coal exports, which had increased in both 2017 and 2018, decreased in both 2019 and 2020. The United States has been a net coal exporter since at least 1949. Net Petroleum Exporter In 2019, for the first ever, the U.S. became a net exporter of petroleum--which includes crude oil and petroleum products. Unfortunately, U.S. crude imports have remained stubbornly high even during the shale boom thanks to healthy domestic demand. U.S. crude oil production has shot up 160% to over 13 million b/d since the advent of the shale era; meanwhile, domestic demand has remained flat but very high at 19-21 million b/d. In 2019, the country still imported 9.1 million b/d of petroleum and other liquids, with 6.8 million b/d of those being crude oil, due to constraints such as regional supply/demand imbalances, infrastructural challenges, and other factors. Further, many of the refineries in the United States are optimized to process the heavier crude grades from Canada, Venezuela, and Mexico instead of the lighter, sweeter oil crude from its own shale fields. Source: EIA The big consolation here is that a bigger proportion of its oil imports have been coming from its northern ally, with crude imports from Canada clocking in at 134 million barrels in 2019 from 76 million in 2008. As Bush predicted, the United States is no longer as heavily reliant on OPEC for its oil, with the organization supplying less than 30% of imports. Renewables Offer The Best Solution It’s, therefore, clear that whereas the overall trend is that the U.S. has been exporting more energy than it imports, it’s still a very mixed bag with many regions still importing vast quantities of crude and other petroleum products. To complicate matters further, the planet’s fossil fuel reserves are finite, with experts estimating that the U.S. only has enough natural gas reserves to last 93 more years, and enough coal to last about 283 years. In other words, the United States will never achieve true energy independence while still relying so heavily on fossil fuels. Indeed, some experts now contend that the only one surefire way to be completely and indefinitely energy independent is by adopting 100% renewable energy. At first, this sounds like a pipe-dream, considering that only tiny Costa Rica has come close to achieving that goal after it generated 98.1% of its electricity from renewables in 2016. The Central American nation, however, has a population of 5 million vs. 330 million by the U.S. and a land area 0.5% the size of the U.S. But some experts still insist that 100% renewable energy in the U.S. is not only feasible but can lower costs. Renewable resources generate only around 19 percent of U.S. electricity in 2020. However, last year, a group of researchers at Stanford University set out to prove that a 100% renewable energy grid by 2050 is not only feasible but can be done without any blackouts and at a lower cost than the existing grid. The researchers matched time-dependent energy supply with demand and storage in a grid integration model for every 30 second interval in 2050 and 2051. The study authors analyzed U.S. regions and countrywide demand until the model produced a solution with what the authors called zero-load loss--meaning, essentially, no blackouts with 100% renewable energy and storage. Wesley Cole, a senior energy analyst at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), says that hourly interval models are more common, but this new study gives researchers like himself a boost of confidence that they are not missing anything by modeling at a higher temporal resolution. “The question is much more an economic question, not so much a technical question,” says Cole. According to Cole, the pathway to a 100% renewable grid is not as expensive as first estimated due to huge cost reductions in solar and wind energy over the years. Unfortunately, politics always seem to get in the way.

2/22/2022,"By Siddarth S (Reuters) - A Wall Street analyst upgraded Advanced Micro Devices to a buy rating after 10 years on Tuesday, highlighting its growing market share, a strong portfolio of computer chips to rival that of Intel and a relatively cheap stock price. ""This is not the AMD of a decade ago,"" Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon said, lifting the brokerage's rating on the company to ""outperform"" — its highest stock rating — from ""market-perform"". AMD's market share for laptop central processing unit (CPU) chips had climbed to nearly 20% in the third quarter of 2021 from a low of under 5% six years ago, Bernstein said, citing data from Mercury Research and its own analysis. ""The quality of AMD's portfolio continues to improve ... AMD's desktop CPU are now, on average, on par with Intel's,"" Rasgon said. AMD shares have ballooned from roughly $2 when Bernstein last had an ""outperform"" rating on them in 2012 to about $114 today, an ascent Rasgon called ""the absolute biggest missed call in our entire Wall Street tenure."" Shares in AMD were slightly lower in premarket trading on Tuesday, but the chipmaker's market value surpassed that of Intel last week. Still, AMD's stock price is currently below 30 times its projected earnings for the next 12 months, with shares nearing their cheapest in five years and ""entering into the realm of downright attractive,"" Rasgon said. Recent commentary from Intel suggests the next several years may be ""open season"" in the key data-center market, another positive for AMD, he added. AMD could also derive more revenue from its recently closed $50 billion acquisition of Xilinx than first thought, Rasgon said. ""Our math suggests the company might see an annual revenue run rate that could be hundreds of millions of dollars higher than current expectations,"" he wrote.

2/22/2022,"Oil price soars to seven-year high as Putin orders troops into Ukraine FTSE 100 rises 0.2pc in volatile trading; Pound falls against dollar Russian stocks and rouble tumble; Gas prices surge Jeremy Warner: How to protect your money from a war in Ukraine Sign up here for our daily business briefing newsletter​ Natural gas prices surged after Germany slammed the brakes on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, while markets were subdued following the UK’s first raft of sanctions against Russia. Boris Johnson outlined sanctions against five Russian banks and three oligarchs in response to Vladimir Putin’s decision to move troops into Ukraine. The Prime Minister said he would not hesitate to roll out further measures if needed, but markets were largely unfazed. Kremlin critic Bill Browder branded the response “pretty tepid”. Meanwhile, European and UK gas prices jumped 10pc after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline couldn’t go ahead, sparking fears of disruptions to energy supplies across the continent. Arch-Kremlin critic Bill Browder has weighed in on the UK's sanctions against Russia, saying they were ""pretty tepid if you ask me"". The financier, who describes himself as Putin's No. 1 enemy, questioned why other major banks such as VTB and Sberbank hadn't been included on the list, as well as the ""other 50 oligarchs"". Read more: Bill Browder: Why I never fly over Russian airspace – and nor should you Investors in Evraz have breathed a sigh of relief after the mining giant dodged the UK's initial raft of sanctions. Shares had fallen this morning amid fears the company, in which Roman Abramovich holds an almost 30pc stake, could be targeted be tough economic measures. But these failed to materialise, sending shares up 5.2pc to the top of the FTSE 100. FTSE 250-listed Petropavlovsk, which had dropped as much as 11pc, pared losses to trade down 4.3pc. Wizz Air will keep flying to Ukraine despite Vladimir Putin’s decision to move Russian troops into parts of the country in a decision that sets it apart from many other western airlines. Oliver Gill has more: The London-listed budget carrier said Ukraine remains “an important part of our growth plans” and would continue running a normal schedule to the country. Germany’s Lufthansa and Swiss Air suspended flights to Ukraine over the weekend amid safety concerns for passengers and crew. Dutch flag carrier KLM has also stopped services to the country and British Airways halted flights last summer. Ryanair has scaled back its services to Ukraine. Michael O’Leary, its chief executive, said it had a duty to fly to Ukraine as long as war had not broken out. It is yet to confirm whether it will now suspend flights. He said last week: “Is it our duty and obligation... to support the people of Ukraine as long as there is no war or missiles flying there.” Wizz said on Tuesday that flights will go ahead as normal. If markets aren't reacting much to the sanctions, it's probably because Britain has decided not to target some of the country's biggest assets. Bloomberg's Javier Blas says VTB, SberBank and Gazprombank are the Russian banks that really matter for oil and gas trading, but they're not targeted. Neither is Gazprom itself. Critics are likely to argue that Boris Johnson's initial sanctions don't go far enough. But the Prime Minister said it was vital to hold further measures in reserve, adding he'd have no hesitation in using them if necessary. For now, the West isn't targeting the 3 state-owned Russian banks that really matter for the oil, gas and other commodity trade: VTB, SberBank, Gazprombank https://t.co/MC6KCuP4o5 — Javier Blas (@JavierBlas) February 22, 2022 There's been very little market response to Britain's sanctions against Russia, with investors left somewhat underwhelmed by the measures. The FTSE 100 is still up 0.3pc after reversing its earlier losses. The pound has extended its fall against the dollar, dropping 0.5pc to $1.3546, though the fall is being driven largely by a rush to safe haven assets and interest rate expectations. Gas prices are still flying after Germany said it's halting the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, while oil has fallen back from its highs and is currently trading at around $97.50. Markets are generally holding up after Ukrainian president Zelensky said that there will be no war with Russia and economic sanctions (so far) have been relatively mild.  Still a fluid situation, but traders see a chance of avoiding outright war. — Matt Weller CFA, CMT (@MWellerFX) February 22, 2022 Boris Johnson said the Government is using ""new and unprecedented powers"" to target Russia with sanctions. The sanctions target the following banks: Rossiya Bank IS Bank General Bank Promsvyazbank Black Sea Bank They'll also target three high-net worth individuals, whose assets held in the UK will be frozen and who will be banned from travelling to the country. These are Gennady Timchenko, as well as Boris and Igor Rotenberg. The Prime Minister said the measures represented a ""first tranche"" of sanctions against Russia and that Britain was ready to go further if needed. He said that Vladimir Putin's venture in Ukraine must fail. Boris Johnson confirms that Britain will sanction five Russian banks in response to the crisis. It is also rolling out measures against three individuals. Boris Johnson has said that the West will continue to pursue a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis. But he warns we have to be ready for President Putin to plough ahead with his offensive regardless. We must ""brace ourselves"" for the next stage of Putin's plan, he adds. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just stood up in the House of Commons to outline details of new sanctions against Russia. He says Russia's actions amount to a ""renewed invasion"" of Ukraine, adding that Vladimir Putin was establishing a pretext for a full-blown conflict. It's set to be a negative start for Wall Street this afternoon as markets grapple with the latest developments in the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Futures tracking Wall Street's three main indices fell 1pc before recouping some of their losses. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones fell 0.2pc, while the Nasdaq lost 0.6pc. We're expecting an announcement from Boris Johnson imminently outlining the details of sanctions against Russia. Here's a handy guide from my colleague Simon Foy on which companies could be affected by the measures, and what sort of impact they could have. What sanctions the UK could place on Russia Gold has dipped below $1,900 an ounce as demand for the safe haven asset waned ahead of fresh sanctions from the UK and EU. The precious metal had surged to an eight-year high earlier in the day, but the gains eased alongside a wider pause in markets as traders took stock of the latest developments in Ukraine. Ole Hansen, head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank, said: “Gold’s rally has paused ahead of a heavy layer of resistance in the $1,917/23 area with momentum not strong enough to take it through at this stage. “We probably have a fair amount of risk premium priced in which normally doesn’t tend to stick around for a prolonged period of time.” All eyes will now be on the announcement of sanctions against Russia to give an indication of how strongly the West will react to Russian aggression. Fuel prices may already be at a record high, but escalating tensions in Ukraine mean it's going to cost even more to fill up at the pumps. That's according to the RAC, which warned forecourt prices would escalate even further as retailers pass on the costs from higher wholesale prices. The average price of petrol hit a new record of 149.12p per litre on Sunday, while diesel hit 152.58p. Crude oil is now closing in on $100 a barrel amid mounting concerns of a war in Ukraine. Simon Williams at the RAC said the crisis was ""already causing oil prices to rise and will undoubtedly send fuel prices inexorably higher towards the grim milestone of £1.50 a litre"". He added: ""The price of oil is likely to go above $100 and stay there on the back of traders fearing future disruptions in supply."" Germany's decision to halt Nord Stream 2 won't affect gas supplies to Europe as the pipeline isn't yet in operation, the EU has said. A spokesman for the European Commission said: ""Nord Stream 2 is not yet functioning, is not supplying energy to Europe. ""It's not a different source of energy, it's a different pipeline for an existing supplier... There's no change in the current situation."" Meanwhile, German Vice-Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck said Germany's gas supply was secured even without Nord Stream 2, which would have doubled flows of gas from Russia. But he admitted the move would contribute to further price rises. Meanwhile, there's fresh scrutiny over interest rate rises on the markets this morning following surprisingly dovish comments from a key Bank of England official. Dave Ramsden, who was one of four officials to vote for a larger 50 basis point rise this month, said his vote was ""finely balanced"". This prompted traders to scale back bets on a half-percentage point increase in March. Mr Ramsden said the Bank was facing its biggest challenge on inflation since it gained independence in 1997. Still, he also said there was only a need for a further ""modest"" tightening of monetary policy in the coming months and pushed back against expectations of aggressive interest rate increases. In case you missed it, here's footage from earlier showing tanks rolling into Donetsk after Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised the independence of two separatist-held regions. These are the images that are rattling both markets and global leaders today, as fears mount that a full-blown invasion is only a matter of time. My colleague Lucy Burton has delved a bit more into HSBC's results this morning. Here's the latest: HSBC’s exposure to the Chinese property market has led to the banking giant taking a $500m (£368m) hit against the potential fallout from the crisis that has rocked the sector. The bank, which makes most of its money in Asia, said that the charge would cover an ""increase in allowances to reflect recent developments in China’s commercial real estate sector"". Developers such as Evergrande, the Chinese property behemoth, have defaulted under the weight of debt payments in recent months and upended the country's property sector. HSBC last year insisted that it expected no material fallout from the saga surrounding debt-riddled Evergrande. The London-based bank is placing all of its bets on growth in Asia and has been moving top executives from London to Hong Kong, where it was founded in 1865 to support international trade between China and Europe. ​Read Lucy's full story here Germany has slammed the brakes on the approval process for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline after Vladimir Putin pushed troops into Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said certification of the controversial gas link couldn't go ahead, describing Russia's actions as a ""serious breach of international law"". The Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which runs between Russia and Germany, has been the source of much controversy, with the US and some EU member states warning it would increase Europe's reliance on Moscow for energy. Germany had been reluctant to include it in any sanctions, as the move will hurt its own gas supplies. However, Mr Scholz said Russia's actions had gone a step too far and the pipeline should not be approved. Prices for key commodities ranging from wheat to platinum have jumped as the escalating conflict between Russia and Ukraine sparked fears of supply disruptions. The region is a major global supplier of raw materials such as wheat, corn and sunflower oil, while Russia is one of the world’s most important sources of metals including aluminium and nickel. Wheat futures rose 2.8pc, while corn traded 2.1pc higher. Aluminium jumped as much as 3.1pc, closing in on an all-time high, while nickel hit a new 10-year high. The surge in prices for raw materials – used in everything from food to cars – will add more fuel to the inflation already hitting economies around the globe. Meanwhile, energy markets were also rattled by the rising tensions. Gas prices jumped as much as 13pc, while Brent crude surged towards $100 a barrel. Well, it's been a volatile morning on the markets. After plunging 1.4pc at the open, the FTSE 100 pared its losses and is now trading up 0.4pc. Oil giants BP and Shell are the biggest upward push on the index, tracking oil prices as they hurtle towards $100 a barrel. There are also gains for Smith & Nephew, InterContinental Hotels Group and Legal & General following updates this morning. The midcap FTSE 250 is now trading flat after dropping as much as 1.8pc. John Wood has suffered its biggest fall in almost two years after revealing it will take a $100m (£74m) charge on a project in Poland. Shares sank as much as 16pc – the most since the outbreak of Covid in March 2020 – after the company announced the charge at its long-delayed Aegis project, which involves constructing buildings at a US missile defence facility. It's the latest blow for the Scottish engineering company, which has already been hit by lower spending among oil and gas producers. John Wood said the charge mainly relates to an assessment of “future customer recoveries,” legal expenses and additional costs of about $20m to complete the project. The company will delay its 2021 results, previously due on March 8, until a review of the project is finished. Several key members of the Opec producer cartel have insisted there's no need to pump more oil even as prices surge towards $100 a barrel. Iraq and Nigeria said the group’s strategy of gradually raising production is enough to balance the market and the group has no need to be more aggressive. Opec has come under pressure to pump more oil amid an extended rally in prices. An escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict has pushed Brent crude to $99, extending this year's jump to 27pc. The 23-nation alliance, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, next meets on March 2. It is factoring in growth in output from non-Opec members such as Brazil and Canada and says it doesn’t want to see any increase in commercially-stored oil around the world. Coca-Cola's European bottling company has said it's got contingency plans in place to cope with the escalating Ukraine crisis as it posted a huge rise in profits driven partly by its Russian business. Coca-Cola HBC said it was considering stockpiling ingredients to limit any disruption in Russia after the West said it would roll out sanctions on Moscow. Chief Executive Zoran Bogdanovic told Reuters: ""We have contingencies in place for all scenarios, including alternative sourcing, so that we can act swiftly to whatever happens."" The London-listed company, which operates in 29 European and African countries and counts Russia and Nigeria as its two biggest markets, had learned lessons from its experience during the 2014 Russia-Ukraine conflict. It came as Coca-Cola HBC beat expectations by posting a 24pc rise in pre-tax profit for last year to €831m (£693m) as the easing of Covid restrictions drove up demand for fizzy drinks. Still, shares dropped more than 5pc, plunging the firm close to the bottom of the FTSE 100. Dubravko Lakos-Bujas at JP Morgan says: While the path of Russia-Ukraine crisis remains unclear with potentially elevated market volatility in the short-term, tightening monetary policy, in our view, still remains the key risk for equities as central banks attempt to aggressively re-anchor inflation expectations lower. Overly restrictive monetary policy could result in an outright policy error especially if the business cycle continues to deteriorate. At the same time, the Russia/Ukraine crisis could force a reassessment of the Fed tightening path resulting in central banks turning less hawkish, while policymakers may consider additional fiscal stimulus. Sean Darby at Jefferies says: Whilst the escalation in tensions is unwelcome, it is unlikely to alter global economic variables that much. The initial reaction to President Putin's declaration was an immediate risk-off with oil prices spiking. Our sense is that part of the equity move was a miscalculation over the earlier Russian troop withdrawal. Russia's economy is itself strong with record foreign exchange reserves, signs of inflation peaking (January 8.7pc), its highest current account ever and debt-to-GDP of around 20pc. The Ukrainian currency has been under pressure recently, while government bond yields have spiked but not to the extent seen during the annexation of Crimea. Here's a round-up of some analyst reaction as the escalating conflict between Russia and Ukraine rattles markets. Elisa Lignos at RBC Capital Markets says: The short-term market reaction will depend on the extent of sanctions imposed by the West. Western leaders have two options – a 'modest' approach, trying to signal de-escalation (what markets 'want' to see) or a firmer approach, recognising that allowing Putin to dismantle Ukraine piece by piece will still achieve his end goal, over a longer timeframe. EU ambassadors are meeting today to discuss their plan for sanctions... The US response is probably more important. This boils down to whether this is termed 'an invasion' or not. Blinken is still scheduled to meet Lavrov in Geneva on Thursday. Mark Haefele at UBC Global Wealth Management says: While we believe it is too early to make a final assessment on what Monday's events may mean for the course of events, we remain of the view that the severe risk case we described earlier – including fighting and a prolonged interruption of Russian energy exports – still represents a tail risk at this stage. Allocations to commodities and energy stocks are an attractive option to help investors hedge portfolio risks. Energy prices would likely rise in the event of an escalation around Ukraine, as well as if cooler heads prevail amid rising demand and somewhat constrained supply. It was a less positive update from Hargreaves Lansdown this morning, however. The investment platform plunged as much as 18pc – its biggest one-day drop on record – after net new inflows for the first half fell short of analyst estimates. Net new business inflows stood at £2.3bn, below estimates of £2.9bn. The company also disappointed on assets under administration, revenue and pre-tax profit. Hargreaves Lansdown enjoyed a pandemic boom as market volatility drove up trading levels, but it seems business is returning to normal. Analysts at Jefferies said the company was sacrificing profitability for growth, adding it was possible that bigger clients had left the platform or drawn down, while newer ones were smaller. After all the market turmoil this morning, let's check in on the big corporate news of the day... HSBC has handed out a whopping $3.5bn (£2.6bn) in bonuses after its profits more than doubled. The staff bonus pool increased by a third, while bosses landed £4.9m in pay and bonuses, as well as £4.1m in long-term performance share awards. Chief executive Noel Quinn picked up a total pay package of £9m for 2021. The huge payouts came as HSBC reported pre-tax profits of $18.9bn (£13.9bn) last year, up from $8.8bn in 2020, when pre-tax profits fell 34pc due to hefty provisions for pandemic loan losses. 2021 is proving to have been a lucrative year for bankers, with NatWest and Standard Chartered announcing large increases in their bonuses. Barclays is expected to follow suit later this week. Russia has brushed off the threat of sanctions, saying the West would impose them regardless of events and describing the response to Russia's recognition of two breakaway Ukrainian regions as predictable. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said: ""Our European, American, British colleagues will not stop and will not calm down until they have exhausted all their possibilities for the so-called ‘punishment of Russia’. ""They are already threatening us with all manner of sanctions or, as they say now, 'the mother of all sanctions'. ""Well, we're used to it. We know that sanctions will be imposed anyway, in any case. With or without reason."" While the FTSE 100 and its European counterparts have pared the worst of their losses, there was no such relief in Asia. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index tumbled more than 3pc – its worst daily drop in five months. China's main Shanghai Composite index fell just shy of 1pc. The MSCI index of Asian stocks was weaker by 1.6pc, while Japan's Nikkei index closed down 1.7pc. This picture pretty much sums up the mood... Alison Ring at accounting body ICAEW said the latest borrowing figures highlight the challenge facing Chancellor Rishi Sunak. The strong tax receipts reported today will provide a welcome respite for the public finances, reducing the shortfall in the government’s income compared with its expenditure from previous forecasts. However, the deficit is still on track to be the third highest ever recorded in peacetime, while public debt is more than half a trillion pounds higher than it was at the start of the pandemic. The challenge for Rishi Sunak will be balancing the strong pressures on him to increase the support package for households facing rapidly rising energy costs and retail prices, with the need to strengthen the resilience of the public finances in the face of a great deal of economic uncertainty and increasing global security concerns. The Chancellor will be acutely aware that while inflation is adding to tax revenues today it will go on to add to public spending tomorrow. Let's turn our attention back to domestic matters now. Tom Rees has all the details from the latest public borrowing figures: Britain’s debt interest bill leapt to its highest level for January since records began last month, eating into the Chancellor’s first-ever budget surplus following two years of heavy borrowing. Government income exceeded spending by £2.9bn last month as a £4.5bn increase in debt servicing costs meant that day-to-day spending was even higher than a year earlier. Interest costs rose from £1.6bn to £6.1bn as high inflation lifted payments on a quarter of the Government’s debt linked to the Retail Price Index. The higher debt servicing costs mean the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is no longer undershooting the Office for Budget Responsibility’s (OBR) forecasts on a monthly basis, cutting his fiscal wiggle room ahead of the Spring Statement. In addition, some of the extra firepower will be used to help households facing much higher energy bills from April. However, the coffers were bolstered by the recovery lifting receipts from a number of taxes, including income tax, stamp duty and business rates. ​Read Tom's full story here Sterling has also clawed back some of its early losses, but it's still trading lower against the dollar. The Russia-Ukraine tension has boosted the US currency as investors flocked to safe haven assets. But closer to home, focus will be on a speech by Bank of England official Dave Ramsden, who's one of the more hawkish members of the monetary policy committee. Analysts at Citi said: ""Ramsden was one of those voting for a 50 basis point rise in February, so the market will monitor his speech today for any clues as to whether he still thinks 50bp is appropriate or whether he may switch to 25bps."" There's also a focus on government finances after the UK's debt interest bill leapt to its highest level for January since records began last month. The pound fell 0.2pc against the dollar to $1.3595. Against the euro it was down 0.3pc to 83.37p. After an initial plunge, markets are starting to claw back their losses as investors wait for the next update in a highly febrile environment. The FTSE 100, which dropped 1.4pc at the open, is now trading down 0.4pc. The pan-European Stoxx 600, which had been 2pc lower, is now down around 0.5pc. Gold – a safe haven favourite for investors – is back down below $1,900, while Russian markets and the rouble have both risen from their worst levels of the day. Geopolitical tensions are notoriously hard to price in, so it's likely investors are sitting back and waiting for the next development in the conflict. Russia's energy minister Nikolay Shulginov has insisted that the country plans to continue exporting natural gas without any disruption. Speaking at a conference in Doha, Mr Shulginov said: ""We are looking for balance in global markets for gas."" The latest escalation in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine pushed up natural gas prices as much as 13pc this morning, while the UK equivalent rose 8pc. The Prime Minister is due to set out further details of measures against Russia in the House of Commons later today. We don't know exactly what they'll look like yet, but Mr Johnson has promised a ""first barrage"" of sanctions. He said the measures will be ""targeted not just at entities in Donbass and Luhansk and Donetsk, but in Russia itself – targeting Russian economic interests as hard as we can"". He added: I think that the tragedy of the present situation is that President Putin has surrounded himself with like-minded advisors who tell him that Ukraine is not a proper country. And I think that he is going to find that he has gravely miscalculated. Boris Johnson added that the UK must move away from its dependence on Russian gas. This is a major issue for European energy markets. Around a third of Russian supplies to the continent come via pipelines passing through Ukraine. Sanctions could disrupt supplies further. However, Britain is less dependent on Russian gas than many of its EU counterparts. Boris Johnson has warned that Vladimir Putin is ""bent on full-scale invasion of Ukraine"", adding that there was ""more Russian irrational behaviour to come"". He's vowed immediate sanctions against Moscow, details of which will come later. The Prime Minister said: [The sanctions] will hit Russia very hard and there is a lot more that we are going to do in the event of an invasion. Be in no doubt that if Russian companies are prevented from raising capital on the UK financial markets, if we unpeel the facade of Russian ownership of companies, of property, it will start to hurt. Boris Johnson has confirmed the UK will target Russia with an immediate package of economic sanctions. The Prime Minister, who's just chaired an emergency COBRA meeting, said Putin had ""completely torn up international law"". He added that Britain will now impose an ""immediate package of international sanctions"". These will include some in Russia itself, with Mr Johnson saying they would hit the ""economic interests that have been supporting Russia's war machine"". He's set to outline more details in the House of Commons this afternoon, hinting that tougher measures could be imposed if there's a full-scale invasion. EU foreign ministers may decide on Russia sanctions after a meeting in Paris this afternoon, according to an EU official. Reuters reports that EU ambassadors in Brussels were set to discuss a wider sanctions package than considered on Monday. We're still waiting for details of the UK's sanctions against Moscow. We're not far away now. Russia's incursion into Ukraine has pushed oil prices ever higher, with the $100 milestone now very much in sight. Benchmark Brent crude is up 3.8pc to just over $99. Many analysts have been predicting the milestone would be hit even without a full-blown conflict between Russia and Ukraine. China is concerned about the ""worsening"" situation in Ukraine, Foreign Minister Wang Yi has said as he repeated calls for all parties to show restraint and resolve differences through dialogue. Mr Wang told US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a telephone call that the legitimate security concerns of any country should be respected, according to the Chinese foreign ministry. He told Mr Blinken: ""The situation in Ukraine is worsening. China once again calls on all parties to exercise restraint."" The US State Department said that on the call Mr Blinken underscored the need to preserve Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity amid Russia's ""aggression"". Earlier today China's embassy in Ukraine warned its nationals there not to venture into unstable areas, but stopped short of telling them to leave, as many other nations have advised their own citizens. It's been a rough start for markets this morning as investors weighed up the prospect of war in Europe. The FTSE 100 plunged 1.4pc at the opening bell, though it's since pared losses to a decline of 0.7pc. There are losses across the board for heavyweight stocks, while Russia-exposed miners Polymetal International, Petropavlovsk and Evraz fell between 3.5pc and 11.7pc on the possibility of sanctions. HSBC was down 1.4pc as its profits fell behind expectations, while Hargreaves Lansdown slumped 15pc following its disappointing results. The domestically-focused FTSE 250 was down 1pc, having dropped as low as 1.8pc. Jeffrey Halley, an analyst at OANDA, says a conflict in Europe could disrupt monetary policy plans and fuel volatility. A full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia will leave many central banks with itchy hiking trigger fingers in a quandary. The immediate impact would be an exacerbation of the rampant inflationary pressures globally as oil hits $130+ a barrel. But the inevitable slump by equity markets and high-yield bond markets, just as credit is tightening around the world will probably have them, along with the Fed, hitting the pause button on tightening, and even perhaps unwinding forward guidance. Volatility will continue to be the winner, as will the US dollar and gold, and global stagflation could be the fait accompli for some time to come. Russia's central bank has said it's ready to take all necessary measures to support financial stability, as Russian assets were hammered by geopolitical fears after Moscow sent ""peacekeeping"" forces into eastern Ukraine. In an effort to help the financial sector adapt to increased volatility, the central bank said banks would be permitted to use the market value of stocks and bonds in their portfolios as of February 18 in earnings reports until October. The rouble sank to a 15-month low against the dollar this morning as Vladimir Putin puts Russia on a war footing. The Russian currency suffered its biggest one-day drop since the start of the pandemic on Monday, plunging on fears that Putin's deployment of ""peacekeeping"" forces was a precursor to a full-scale invasion. The volatile rouble fell 1.1pc to 80.64 against the dollar this morning after hitting 80.97 – a level last seen on March 23 2020. The jitters are being felt in equity markets across the globe this morning. After the FTSE dropped 1.3pc, it's an even worse start for Europe's main indices. France's CAC and Germany's Dax are both down more than 2pc. As expected, the FTSE 100 has dropped sharply at the open. The blue-chip index slumped 1.3pc to 7,387 points as Russia's decision to push troops into Ukraine rattled global markets. We'll be keeping an eye on the index ahead of expected sanctions against Moscow, which could send shares down even further. Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions towards Ukraine show he has chosen confrontation with the West over dialogue, Sajid Javid has said. The Health Secretary told the BBC: ""We've always preferred dialogue and still continue to do so but it's clear from President Putin's actions that he has chosen confrontation over dialogue."" His comments come as Boris Johnson chairs an emergency meeting of COBRA to determine sanctions against Russia. As the conflict escalates, fears are mounting that European energy supplies could be disrupted. About a third of Russian gas supplies to Europe normally travel through pipelines crossing Ukraine. Sanctions against Moscow could also upend commodity markets from oil and gas to metals and agriculture. Benchmark European gas prices surged as much as 13pc, before trading up around 10pc. The UK equivalent is up more than 8pc. Meanwhile, oil prices have continued their ascent after a brief hiatus, with Brent crude hitting a new seven-year high of over $97 a barrel. The escalation in tensions means oil could well hit the milestone of $100 in the coming days. It's not just Britain threatening sanctions, though. US ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield has confirmed that the US will impose measures against Moscow for its violation of international law. In a tweet she wrote: ""We can, will, and must stand united in our calls for Russia to withdraw its forces, return to the diplomatic table & work toward peace."" Tomorrow, the U.S. will impose sanctions on Russia for its violation of international law and Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. We can, will, and must stand united in our calls for Russia to withdraw its forces, return to the diplomatic table & work toward peace. — Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield (@USAmbUN) February 22, 2022 Sajid Javid has warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has begun, adding we were ""waking up to a very dark day in Europe"". Tanks have been spotted rolling into breakaway regions of Ukraine after President Vladimir Putin recognised their independence. The Health Secretary told Sky News that Putin had ""decided to attack the sovereignty of Ukraine and its territorial integrity"", adding: ""You could conclude that the invasion of Ukraine has begun."" Boris Johnson is currently chairing an emergency meeting of COBRA, during which he's expected to finalise financial sanctions targeting Russian businesses. Russian stocks have dropped even further this morning after suffering their sharpest decline since March 2014 as the standoff between the West and Russia intensifies. The benchmark MOEX Russia Index dropped 7.1pc, with energy giants Gazprom and Lukoil – as well as financial services firm Sberbank – suffering the biggest falls. The index had slumped as much as 14pc on Monday – its biggest drop since the global financial crisis in 2008. The rouble plunged to a 15-month low against the dollar. Good morning.  It's set to be a tumultuous day on markets after Russian President Vladimir Putin stepped up the assault on Ukraine. The Russian leader ordered the deployment of troops to two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine after recognising them as independent on Monday, sparking fears of a full-blown conflict. Asian markets slumped, and the FTSE 100 is set to follow suit. Fears of disruption in energy markets sent natural gas prices surging 13pc, while oil prices pushed towards $100 a barrel. 1) The City takes on Brussels in 'high stakes poker' over Brexit freedoms EU-era regulations under scrutiny as bloc ramps up plans to poach clearing off London 2) Lotus courts investors to capitalise on China's electric car revolution British supercar maker hopes China's middle-class can be its new growth engine 3) Richard Branson's Hyperloop slashes half its staff in cargo shift Redundancies follow exodus of executives at vacuum-based transport company 4) British regulator wades into Sir Nick Clegg’s battle with Google Search giant’s move to block ad-tracking tech could cost Facebook tens of billions of dollars 5) Heathrow chief quits civil service recruitment panel after backlash from airlines John Holland-Kaye steps down after airlines raised impartiality fears Global stocks tumbled while safe-havens rallied and oil surged as Europe's eastern flank stood on the brink of war after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine.

2/22/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Most of the world hates inflation. For Nikhil Choraria and a small band of traders, it’s an opportunity. Most Read from Bloomberg U.S. Condemns Russian Move at UN, Reassures Kyiv: Ukraine Update Porsches, Lamborghinis Lost at Sea May Cost VW $155 Million Stocks Retreat, Ruble Weakens on Ukraine Tension: Markets Wrap Kremlin Cautious on Prospect of Biden-Putin Summit Amid Tensions Trump Holds Onto Piles of Cash, Gives None to GOP Candidates The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner is a leading practitioner of the obscure art of inflation trading, a niche business that’s exploded -- very lucratively -- for some of the world’s major banks and hedge funds. Choraria, 38 and based in London, orchestrates often-complex transactions designed to profit from gyrations in inflation. Over the past year, his team picked the right side on trades underpinned by the biggest inflationary spike in decades, which convulsed the global economy and even blindsided some central bankers. They helped generate $450 million in revenue in 2021, twice what they made in previous years, according to people familiar with the bank. At JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York, global head of non-linear rates Gil Holmes helped generate about $300 million from inflation trading last year, while traders at Barclays Plc and Morgan Stanley also profited, people familiar with the situation said. In all, the biggest Wall Street banks shared some $2.3 billion from the business in 2021, more than double what they made in 2019, according to data from Vali Analytics Ltd. -- a welcome boost as other kinds of fixed income trading dried up. There are outsized risks too. The sterling inflation market is known as “the widow maker,” reflecting the danger of becoming trapped in huge losses when traders can’t keep up with the many, messy factors that drive real-world prices. The U.K. market is so small and specialized that a few people moving jobs can make it tricky to find anyone who’s willing to trade. It’s not a market for the faint of heart, and not everyone gets it right all the time. But for those who can navigate these challenges, inflation has finally become a goldmine as rising energy costs and snarled supply chains drive up the cost of just about everything. Trading Surge Interest rates were left at rock-bottom after the 2008 financial crisis, removing a key factor in inflation volatility and making this business a relative backwater. “Kind of boring,” according to Tim Magnusson, chief investment officer at Garda Capital Partners, a hedge fund that’s traded inflation since about 2006. Now, investors are flocking to protect themselves or speculate on where consumer prices might go from here. Average daily trading in inflation-linked government bonds and derivatives is up 30% on a year ago and more than double the level in 2019, according to data from Tradeweb Markets Inc. in London. “With fixed-income investors becoming more nervous that the zero-interest-rate environment is over, they will have to move toward these kind of investments,” said Peter Hahn, a former banker at Citigroup Inc. who is now emeritus professor at the London Institute of Banking & Finance. “And that will make Wall Street money.”The U.S. Consumer Price Index climbed to 7.5% in January, the highest since 1982 -- before Choraria was born. In the U.K., one in 10 may not be able to afford consistent heat and electricity. Governments across the European Union are doling out relief packages to help citizens cope with rising bills. Households from Latin America to South Asia are also dealing with rising prices. Central banks globally are mulling how much they should jack up interest rates to cool some of this pressure without hampering the economic recovery. Traders are trying to spot the peak. As expectations for U.K. price rises approach their highest since 2009, concerns in the U.S. and Europe have already begun to ease from last year’s level. “Inflation volatility has picked up significantly,” said Semin Soher Power, head of inflation trading at Bank of Ireland Group Plc in Dublin, who drew on her Turkish roots to accurately predict the price hikes last year. “With higher volatility, we also had more opportunities for inflation trades.” Choraria’s team profited by correctly predicting the direction of European inflation in the wake of the pandemic, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing private information. He joined Goldman Sachs in London as a trainee, earning promotion to managing director in 2012 and then six years later to partner -- its most elite rung. The team at Goldman Sachs includes Pushkar Jha and Wajih Ahmed, who was once described by a local newspaper as a “child prodigy” when he enrolled at the University of Southampton at the age of 14. They generated most of what the bank made from this business globally last year, the people said. Sebastian Howell, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment. Choraria declined requests for an interview. Barclays spokesman Matt Scully, Morgan Stanley spokesman Tom Walton and JPMorgan spokesman Richard Hillary all declined to comment. “Interest in inflation markets has grown beyond anything we’ve seen in the past 10 years, and we believe we are just getting started,” said Lindsay Politi, a former inflation trader who now helps oversee more than $2 billion at Greenwich, Connecticut-based One River Asset Management LLC. “Market participants have yet to truly recognize the regime that we have entered. Most market observers have been expecting inflation to revert back to normal levels for over a year now and that hasn’t played out.” Link to the Past Inflation-linked bonds can be traced back to 1780 when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts issued them to U.S. soldiers fighting the Revolutionary War to protect them from spiraling prices. Two centuries later, the U.K. began selling similar securities known today as “linkers” while the U.S. followed in 1997 with Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS. Derivatives tied to inflation, such as inflation swaps, also emerged. One way a trader might make money on inflation nowadays is with a derivative known as a zero-coupon inflation swap. They pay a fixed rate to a seller, and in return get a floating interest rate tied to a benchmark such as the U.S. CPI after a set period of time. An investor who bought a 12-month swap a year ago would today receive a gain of more than 5%, Politi said. Traders also buy and sell the securities to exploit price swings and book short-term profits. Prices for the derivatives hit an all-time high in November and are still trading at more than double their historical average. They jumped the most in more than a decade on Feb. 10 when the U.S. Labor Department released the unexpectedly high inflation figures, Bloomberg data show. These assets grew up around the needs of long-term investors such as pension funds and insurance companies. With high volatility, though, comes a new generation of participants, and traders outside the big banks are also stirring the market. Hedge funds such as Brevan Howard Asset Management and Citadel, which use borrowed money to inflate potential gains, are behind much of the recent surge and are trading at levels not seen since before the 2008 financial crisis, according to market participants interviewed by Bloomberg. Spokespeople for the funds declined to comment. “If there’s money to be made, hedge funds like ours and everyone else will chase the opportunity,” said Magnusson at Garda, which has $8 billion under management. “And the opportunity in inflation has been there for sure. But opportunity means you can lose money as well.” Some investors, meanwhile, are hedging their bets elsewhere. CME Group Inc. saw a 20% increase in Bitcoin futures contracts during January compared to the previous month. Some traders see the cryptocurrency as insulated from monetary policy and a haven from price pressures, according to Tim McCourt, CME’s managing director and global head of equity products. Intercontinental Exchange Inc. has seen a surge in futures and options linked to the Sterling Overnight Index Average, which traders use to hedge against inflation. The number of outstanding contracts reached a record high of more than 7.9 million on Feb. 15, with an estimated notional value of 1.99 trillion pounds ($2.7 trillion), a spokeswoman said. Merry-Go-Round Banks and hedge funds across Wall Street and London have been hiring to keep up, according to Canice Hogan, founder of recruitment firm Shadowhound Ltd. in the U.K. capital. But there are a limited number of specialists in this increasingly complicated world, he said. That’s especially true in the bazaar for sterling-based inflation products. Last summer, a handful of job moves in London had an impact on market liquidity, according to a senior inflation trader at one of the world’s biggest banks who requested anonymity. Guy Winkworth, who led European inflation trading at Morgan Stanley, left for Deutsche Bank AG. James Bucknall moved from the German bank to NatWest Group Plc, while Su Liu, who oversaw sterling rates trading at BNP Paribas SA, moved to Citigroup Inc. “At least half of the market was on gardening leave,” said Hogan. “With such a small pool of talent, this means that the merry-go-round of movement was more obvious.” Widow-Maker The London inflation scene -- the market known somewhat outdatedly as “the widow maker” -- has a particular propensity to inflict sudden losses, said Hogan. Any kind of “semi crisis” in the wider economic picture can scare away buyers, leaving traders with no escape route from large loss-making positions, he said. When energy prices exploded in the U.K. last year, the market for inflation-linked bonds became “completely dysfunctional,” said Mike Riddell, who manages about $8 billion at Allianz Global Investors. Some hedge funds “blew up” in September and October while traders at banks were left holding losses, he said. “Dealers at banks couldn’t offload any risk they were hit with,” said Riddell. “Liquidity dried up.” NatWest Group Plc’s inflation trading desk was caught out during that period. The British bank said in its latest earnings that market moves in sterling rates and inflation led to losses that breached its internal risk gauge, known as the value-at-risk model, on three occasions during October. The desk lost about $30 million on sterling and euro inflation trading during the second half of the year, according to one person familiar with the matter. A spokeswoman for the Edinburgh-based lender declined to comment. Another risk stems from obscurity. Inflation trades take place between parties, rather than through a public exchange. This model is more profitable for the banks that tailor them but also harder to value and manage. Today’s inflation traders have little experience of the current conditions, said Hahn, the emeritus professor in London. “It doesn’t mean they’re fools and they don’t know what they’re doing, but it’s probably a big issue for risk managers,” said Hahn. “Anybody with experience trading into an increasing rate environment is probably retired.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Removing Résumés From Hiring Process Can Improve Diversity Elon Musk’s Boring Company Plots Texas Tunnels Wall Street Is Buying Starter Homes to Quietly Become America’s Landlord ‘Zero-Click’ Hacks Are Growing in Popularity.

2/22/2022,"Time for a touch of optimism. Recession concerns may be on the rise (see Google search trends below) thanks to soaring inflation, rising gas prices and an unpredictable conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but that doesn't mean building out an all defensive stock portfolio is the correct move, warns veteran JPMorgan market strategist Mislav Matejka. ""We think it is wrong to position for a recession given still extremely favorable financing conditions, very strong labour markets, under-leveraged consumer, strong corporate cash flows and banks’ strong balance sheets. The sector leadership remains risk-on, and it is not consistent with a continued slowdown,"" Matejka said in a new note to clients. Matejka thinks investors should stay bullish on banks, mining, energy, insurance, autos, travel and telecom stocks. ""We believe one should look through the widespread 'slowdown' calls that are currently in vogue,"" Matejka adds. It's those economic slowdown calls from Wall Street — in part also reflecting fears of faster-than-expected interest rate hikes — that has weighed heavily on stocks almost two months into 2022. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-6.2%), S&P 500 (-8.8%) and Nasdaq Composite (-13.4%) are all down for the year. Slowdown worries have hammered the once hot FAANG (Facebook's parent company Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) complex even more — the average stock in this cohort is down 19% year-to-date. Meta is the worst performer, down nearly 40%. In turn, investors have rotated into perceived safe havens. Gold prices have gained in 12 of the past 15 sessions as the yellow metal knocks on the door of $2,000 an ounce. Shares of dividend-paying, consistent growing soda giant Coca-Cola are trading at a record high. ""Upcoming recession scare best played via long bonds-short commodities,"" said the latest Bank of America fund manager survey. Other big names on the Street agree that recession fears are perhaps too elevated right now. Queens' College, Cambridge University president and Allianz advisor Mohamed El-Erian said on Yahoo Finance Live a recession this year is unlikely despite inflationary pressures. ""I think for the United States, don't under estimate the resilience of the U.S. economy. I think the biggest risk to the U.S. economy is a policy mistake [from the Federal Reserve]. That is the biggest risk,"" El-Erian said. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

SoftBank sold 20 million Alibaba shares in the last quarter and ""will need to sell more in 2022,"" Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a note. The group will need $40 billion-45 billion of cash this year, Goyal estimates, if it maintains the current pace of investing in startups and share repurchases as part of the 1 trillion yen ($8.7 billion) programme announced in November. SoftBank is prioritising Vision Fund 2, which has taken stakes in more than 200 companies including recent investments in AI software firm 6sense, digital financing platform Funding Societies and cryptocurrency business Polygon. While earlier this month SoftBank said there was no link between Alibaba registering a U.S. share facility and any plan to sell down its stake, the group is under pressure to trim stakes following the collapse of the deal to sell chip designer Arm to Nvidia. ""We will definitely be selling a good chunk of assets,"" SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son told analysts earlier this month, pointing to options including the public Vision Fund portfolio, where many assets are trading below their listing price. The conglomerate, which was forced to sell Arm after it was hit by falling valuations during the COVID-19 pandemic, hopes to list the British firm in New York. SoftBank's loan-to-value ratio rose to 22% at December-end from 19% three months earlier. When additional borrowing is included the ratio is closer to 30%, Goyal estimates. A successful Arm listing will give the group more dry powder for options including buybacks, Son said, amid executive frustration over the group's persistent conglomerate discount. ""It's a big buyback time now,"" Son said in a recent English language video aimed at investors.

2/22/2022,"By Tom Sims FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Allianz has dismissed two asset managers who oversaw a group of investment funds that collapsed after racking up massive losses when the spread of coronavirus triggered wild market swings, according to regulatory filings. The downfall of the $15 billion Structured Alpha funds has landed the German insurance company in hot water with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and Securities and Exchange Commission, which are both investigating what went wrong. The funds were run by portfolio manager Greg Tournant, who had been with Allianz Global Investors since 2002, according to a profile that used to be on Allianz's website. ""(Tournant) was discharged for violation of firm policies designed to ensure compliance with industry regulations and standards relating to the preparation and provision of client communications,"" according to a filing on Dec. 13 by the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Reuters reported in October that the DOJ was looking into possible misconduct by managers of the Structured Alpha funds and the misrepresentation of risk to investors. Tournant did not immediately respond to a LinkedIn message seeking comment and has not responded to multiple previous efforts by Reuters to contact him. Allianz declined to comment. A second Allianz employee, Stephen Bond-Nelson, was ""discharged for violation of firm compliance policies"", according to a separate filing. Reuters was unable to reach Bond-Nelson for comment. Investors in the funds, which were predominantly U.S. public pension funds, have sued Allianz for a total of $6 billion in damages, though settlements have now been reached with some. The Allianz funds used complex options strategies to generate returns but when the coronavirus pandemic sent stock markets into a tailspin in February and March 2020, they plummeted in value, in some cases by 80% or more. In their lawsuits, investors alleged Allianz had strayed from its stated investment strategy of hedging to limit potential losses. The funds catered in particular to normally conservative U.S. pension funds, including those for labourers in Alaska, teachers in Arkansas and subway workers in New York. Last week, Allianz announced a 3.7 billion euro ($4.2 billion) provision to deal with the fallout, pushing the company into a fourth-quarter loss and resulting in a cut in pay for its chief executive and other board members. In a 2016 video reviewed by Reuters, Tournant likened Structured Alpha's strategy to insurance. ""Our strategies are not race cars looking to speed their way to high returns. They're four-wheel drive vehicles designed to tackle rough terrain,"" he said in separate marketing material.

2/22/2022,"The adherents of the YOLO movement are a young bunch of diehard optimists believing in a single stock and its future performance, pitching in all the chips they have, while hoping for the best. The meme phenomenon has spread far and wide beyond the obscure dark and not-so-dark humor online boards into the financial market, with crypto meme coin tickers taking up the precious characters of Tweets posted by some prominent investors like Elon Musk. But it has recently overspilled into the conventional financial industry of Wall Street, taking on the form of the YOLO movement. This bizarre phenomenon has seen stocks being pumped beyond even the most optimistic prices by online message boards in an almost coordinated tidal wave that swept across the booming market through 2020 and 2021. With over 80% of investors in YOLO stocks being born in the late 1990s, their overconfidence in continued market growth is staggering, allowing them to take on leverage in the form of credits and debts to start investing in selected stocks. And though there is no actual asset class that could be termed YOLO, it pertains to companies that have posted immense gains and generated headlines during the pandemic lockdown period. Among the most notable examples over 2020 to 2021 are AMC Entertainment (AMC), which skyrocketed by over 2,000% in just under a year, and GameStop (GME)– up 5,232% in the past year. Others in the league are Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBY) with 328% gains, Blackberry (BB) – 113% year-to-date, and others. It all started in early 2021 with GameStop Corp. (GME), which saw its stocks boosted by a group of Reddit users who started investing in it and attracted others to do so. The price soared tenfold from $4 in 2020 to $350 in early 2021. And though stocks eventually took a nosedive to $40 by February of 2021, the GME saga allowed some investors to make millions in short positions on its traction in under a few weeks. Needless to say, a legend was born that took on a life of its own and spread like wildfire, feeding on the hype frenzy and the trusting nature of YOLO stock investors. In fact, stocks with considerable short interest attract droves of buyers. In turn, the short-sellers have to start covering their positions by buying back the shares that they had previously borrowed and sold. Such a rush results in massive artificial demand fueled by message board posts, pushing prices up. Youth is oftentimes described as a disease of inexperience. And rightly so, considering the young age of most investors in YOLO stocks. Such inexperience in true market dynamics is the reason why the strategy is extremely risky, as most investors in one-off stocks hyped by message boards have never seen a bearish market, nor have they any clue of what a market crash looks like. Considering that, and the fact that many of them are investing borrowed funds, their life savings, or even their mom-&-pops’ money, is painting out an eerie picture of the potential consequences of what a sudden market crash or shakeup could result in. Past the fun and excitement of YOLO investing lies the harsh reality that only a meager portion of quick in-&-out investors rake in millions on the strategy. The risks far outweigh the benefits, as the odds of losing all are roughly the same as making some. Intuition and message board posts from users pursuing their own interests are far from ideal investment consultants. When taking on the murky path of YOLO investing, one must never forget about portfolio diversification — a pillar of investment management that most young investors simply disregard. Apart from offering some interaction with a community of concurring investors that may vanish as quickly as the investment in hyped stocks, YOLO is not a sound long-term investment strategy. The mere fact that YOLO stocks were chronic underperformers is a clear indicator that their price spikes are doomed to be grounded the moment the hype wears out. However, if one is eager to try out YOLO investing, the first step would be to select the proper stocks. Reddit channels like Wallstreetbets are the go-to venue, where heated discussions and real-time updates can shed light on potential unicorns and gems. Doing some proper research is also vital, making sure that selected companies have high short interest and available call options, so essential for leveraged investments and bets on positive price traction. YOLO is a fad, a fleeting phenomenon that is certainly not for the average or inexperienced investor. Such stocks are best suited for professional traders with leverage to spend, while novice or entry-capital market players should opt for lower-risk instruments like growth stocks, value stocks, dividend stocks, and large-cap stocks of major companies. Considering that a great many YOLO investors entered the market out of boredom during the first lockdowns, or after being chatted into it by friends and message board users, the risks they bear with every cent injected are immense. YOLO is more like gambling with borrowed money, where the chances are teetering on the edge of the blade either way. Far worse is the fact that YOLO stocks serve the experienced investor and the lucky few, attracting droves of fresh liquidity providers by splaying a handful of success stories as the norm of future stock performance for all involved. With less experience and even less money than previous generations, YOLO investors are playing naked with fire.

2/22/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - Tech-dominated ""growth"" stocks are still not cheap despite some sharp falls over the last six months, analysts at U.S. investment bank JPMorgan cautioned on Monday. The so-called FAANGs have seen some of their COVID-era surges cut back this year, with Facebook down 38%, Apple down 5.7%, Amazon down 8.5% and Netflix and Google down 35% and 10% respectively.. JPMorgan's analysts estimate that on average tech firms that are yet to even make a profit have lost 30% of their value since peaks around September last year, while 'fintech' firms which focus on tech-savvy banking apps and tools have dropped 40%. ""As Growth stocks weakened of late, they derated, but are still not outright cheap,"" JPMorgan's analysts said in a note to clients, adding that banks and commodity-linked stocks which have rallied this year thanks to rising oil and metals prices or interest rates were still ""far from expensive"". The chance is that the earnings of 'growth' sectors might not be exceptional anymore, although the big driver remains bond market borrowing costs, which have shot up this year as top central banks have laid the groundwork for interest rate rises. Years of record-low rates have fuelled the tech stock rally but with those rates now rising again the appeal of stratospherically-valued tech stocks gets dimmer for investors, especially if their growth trajectories splutter. ""We believe that bond yields will keep moving higher through the course of the year,"" JPMorgan said referring to the bond market costs ""Our fixed income strategists expect U.S. 10-year (Treasury) yields to reach 2.35% by the end of this year, and German 10-year yields to reach 0.5%."" Treasury yields are now at 1.92% and Germany bunds are at 0.2%. They also said that the tensions building between Russia and Western powers over Ukraine shouldn't drive a return to big tech names, which carved out a safe-haven reputation during the pandemic.

2/22/2022,"The Biden Administration has delayed or stopped work on federal oil and gas leases and permits following a court ruling that struck down the Administration’s “social cost of carbon” metric to account for climate risk when holding lease sales or issuing permits. Earlier this month, Judge James D. Cain, JR of a Louisiana district court granted a preliminary injunction sought by major fossil fuel-producing states in a lawsuit against the Biden Administration challenging the so-called “social cost of carbon” in rule-making and decision-making regarding lease sales. As a result of this court ruling, the Administration has stopped or delayed work on leases, grants, permits, and rules so that agencies can assess whether and how they can proceed, the U.S. Justice Department said in a court filing on Saturday. In it, the Administration filed a motion for a stay pending appeal. “The Court’s injunction not only bars any mandatory obligation imposed by Section 5 of Executive Order 13990 for Defendants to use the Interim Estimates when monetizing the social costs of greenhouse gas emissions in regulatory analysis, but also bars Defendants from exercising their authority to operate independently within the policymaking boundaries set by Congress and to agree with the Working Group’s analysis to the extent the agency deemed appropriate within its statutory authority,” the U.S. Administration said. The injunction over the “social cost of carbon” interim estimate further complicates the Department of the Interior’s efforts to comply with a separate court ruling. In that ruling by a D.C. court in January 2022, a federal judge threw out the biggest oil and gas lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico on the grounds that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management broke the environmental law—the National Environmental Policy Act—by failing to properly factor in the emission-related impact of the lease sale.

Restaurant employers must understand that keeping workers’ tips or diverting a portion of these tips to managers or supervisors in a tip pool is illegal,” Steven McKinney, the division's district director in Manchester, New Hampshire, said in a news release.

2/22/2022,"(Reuters) -McDonald's Corp on Sunday said Carl Icahn has nominated two members to its board of directors in an escalating fight over the treatment of pigs by the burger chain's suppliers. The billionaire activist investor, who stated that he holds 200 shares in the company, nominated Leslie Samuelrich and Maisie Ganzler to stand for election at the 2022 annual meeting, the company said in a statement, adding that it would evaluate the nominees as it would any other board candidates. Icahn has previously said that it is ""obscene"" how the animals used for McDonald's products are treated. Icahn has insisted on new McDonald's commitments, including requiring all of the company's U.S. pork suppliers to move to ""crate free"" pork, and set specific timeframes, the company said. Such a commitment would be impossible given the current supply ""and would harm the company's shared pursuit of providing customers with high quality products at accessible prices,"" the statement said. McDonald's pledged in 2012 to source pork from producers who do not use small crates to house pregnant sows. Icahn pushed for the change behind the scenes, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month. ""Since making this commitment, McDonald's has led the industry, and today an estimated 30%-35% of U.S. pork production has moved to group housing systems,"" the company's statement said. The company expects to source 85% to 90% of its U.S. pork volumes from sows not housed in gestation crates during pregnancy by the end of 2022 and expects 100% of its U.S. pork to come from sows housed in groups during pregnancy by the end of 2024, it added. McDonald's also said it was ""noteworthy"" that Icahn, the majority owner of Viskase, a company that supplies packaging for the pork industry, ""has not publicly called on Viskase to adopt commitments similar to those of McDonald's 2012 commitment."" Icahn did not immediately respond to a request for comment. McDonald's said it sources only approximately 1% of its U.S. pork production and does not own any sows, or produce or package pork in the United States. Icahn, who became known as a corporate raider on Wall Street, was embroiled in a proxy battle with Southwest Gas Holdings Inc in November last year.

2/22/2022,"U.S. stock futures bounced back from overnight lows Tuesday morning but remained below the flatline to start the holiday-shortened week as investors continued to monitor tensions between Russia and Ukraine and await the Kremlin’s next move. Futures on all three major indexes traded just below breakeven as of 7:15 a.m. ET ahead of Tuesday’s open. Contracts on the S&P 500 were mostly flat, down 0.28% to 4,331.50, while futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked slightly lower by 0.32% to 33,899. Nasdaq futures fell 0.74% to 13,893. Wall Street was closed for trading on Monday in observance of Presidents Day, but investors will return from the long weekend to a series of new developments on the geopolitical front that are likely to extend the recent pressure on stocks. Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized the deployment of Russian troops into two breakaway pro-Moscow regions in eastern Ukraine after announcing Monday evening he would recognize their independence. The move was seen by the West as a provocation and intensified worries a war was underway. Just last week, the Biden administration warned that recognizing the self-declared ""People's Republics"" of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine would defy international law and Ukraine's sovereignty and ""necessitate a swift and firm response"" from America and its allies. President Joe Biden signed an executive order Monday imposing sanctions that target the two Russia-backed separatist regions, specifically prohibiting ""new investment, trade and financing by U.S. persons to, from, or in"" the so-called Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. In the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson is also set to unveil a ""significant"" package of sanctions on Russia Tuesday morning, Sky News reported. “There are three different buckets of economic impact of what’s ongoing right now between Russia and Ukraine,” Douglas Rediker, founder of the policy and markets advisory firm Capital Strategies and non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told Yahoo Finance Live. “The first is the direct impact of a potential Russian invasion and the disruption of commerce and economic activity on the back of that invasion, the second is sanctions, and the third is if we do put on sanctions what the retaliatory measures might be that Russia might impose on the U.S. and Europe.” The conflict creates an added headwind for markets already holding its breath in anticipation of the Federal Reserve’s next move as it looks to tighten monetary conditions to mitigate surging inflationary pressures. A war between Russia and Ukraine could exacerbate inflation and spur other economic disruptions. Robert Schein, chief investment officer of Blanke Schein Wealth Management, argued while the markets have been sensitive to headline risk from Russia-Ukraine tensions, central bank policies remain the most critical concern for investors right now. “We believe the risk of a Russian invasion of Ukraine is overstated, as war invasions are not typically telegraphed in advance and there is usually an element of surprise, which is clearly not the case with Russia-Ukraine,” Schein said in a note. “Federal Reserve policy remains the market's biggest risk and investors are hoping that the Fed can engineer a soft landing, which would involve tightening policy just enough to calm rising inflation.” “The market is in 'wait and see mode,' as investors brace for the Federal Reserve's next move,” he added. — Home price growth in the U.S. stalled in the last month of 2021, but the full year logged in record gains. Standard & Poor’s said Tuesday that its S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index saw an 18.8% annual gain in December, unchanged from November. The 20-City Composite posted an 18.6% annual gain, up from 18.3% a month earlier. The 20-City results were higher than analysts’ expectations of an 18% annual gain, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. “For the year, the National Composite Index recorded a gain of 18.8%. This is the highest calendar year increase in 34 years of data, and substantially ahead of 2020’s 10.4% gain,” said Craig J. Lazzara, managing director and global head of index investment strategy at S&P DJI, in a statement. “The 10- and 20-City Composites rose 17.0% and 18.6%, respectively — a record for the 20-City Composite, and the second-best year ever for the 10-City Composite.” — The U.K. has imposed targeted economic sanctions on five Russian banks and three high net-worth individuals following a move by President Vladimir Putin to send troops into eastern Ukraine on Monday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the ""first tranche"" of sanctions are aimed at Rossiya, IS Bank, General Bank, Promsvyazbank and the Black Sea Bank when addressing lawmakers in the House of Commons on Tuesday. The three “very high net worth” individuals also targeted were Russian billionaires Gennady Timchenko, Boris Rotenberg and Igor Rotenberg, who will be banned from traveling to the country and see U.K. assets frozen as part of the measure. ""This is the first tranche, the first barrage, of what we are prepared to do,"" Johnson said. ""We will hold further sanctions at readiness, to be deployed alongside the United States and the European Union if the situation escalates still further."" — Macy's Inc.

2/22/2022,"Bitcoin brought in the future wave when it debuted back in 2009. Although it took the world about ten years to notice its actual value, today, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are becoming a part of some major financial institutions across the globe. Still, at the same time losing the core values it was built upon. The Man Institute explained that the rising correlation of the king coin with pre-established investment institutions leads to the cryptocurrency turning into just another “rate sensitive risk asset.” Bitcoin was created to allow people to control their own money and finance without being dependent upon the traditional financial system of banks. And while that same dream led to the birth of multiple other similar assets, the present market conditions seem to be killing that dream. Equities are usually the riskiest assets as their value is tied to distant cash flows. And up until 2019, the correlation between Bitcoin and the stock exchange NASDAQ was negative. However, since then, this correlation has been rising. Standing at 0.51 at its peak in August 2020, the correlation came down significantly around March 2021 but shot back up soon. Right now, Bitcoin shares a correlation of 0.46 with NASDAQ. Similarly, its correlation with Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds has also risen. In a way, ETFs are also subjected to the same treatment as equities, and thus a high correlation with it indicates that Bitcoin is changing entirely as an asset class. On the rising correlation, the report stated: “This mirrors bitcoin’s journey along the Gartner hype cycle: from being an underground tech phenomenon, the flagship cryptocurrency is now a mainstream way for both institutional and retail investors to speculate. In our view, it is therefore unsurprising that it is becoming increasingly correlated with the very riskiest assets – equities (sic).” Adding to the same, the Man Institute iterated: “…the higher the correlations get, the more bitcoin seems to be another manifestation of a crucial facet of investing over the past decade: there is too much capital chasing too little genuine economic growth.” After five straight days of red candles, Bitcoin today looked somewhat green at press time. In the last few days, the king coin’s value has trickled down by over $6k (13.86%) to trade at $38,757. The bearish crossover visible on the MACD that occurred three days ago is only gaining more strength as the bearishness continues to rise. This is not a good sign for Bitcoin since even the Parabolic SAR signals a downtrend.  If the indicators turn right, BTC could witness further price fall.

2/22/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Union members, who’ve been locked out of Exxon Mobil Corp.’s Beaumont refinery on the Texas Gulf Coast since May, accepted the company’s latest contract offer Monday, people familiar with the vote said.

Temporary workers have been running the refinery since May 1. The approval comes four months after members of the local United Steelworkers union resoundingly turned down a previous deal to end the labor dispute. The new local contract makes Martin Luther King Jr. a paid holiday and amends some language including the makeup of a workmen’s committee. Approving a new worker agreement removes uncertainty about having an adequately trained labor force at a time when Exxon is working to expand the 369,000-barrel-a-day site by 250,000 barrels.

2/22/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese authorities told the nation’s biggest state-owned firms and banks to start a fresh round of checks on their financial exposure and other links to Ant Group Co., renewing scrutiny of billionaire Jack Ma’s financial empire, according to people familiar with the matter. Most Read from Bloomberg U.S. Condemns Russian Move at UN, Reassures Kyiv: Ukraine Update Porsches, Lamborghinis Lost at Sea May Cost VW $155 Million Stocks Retreat, Ruble Weakens on Ukraine Tension: Markets Wrap Kremlin Cautious on Prospect of Biden-Putin Summit Amid Tensions Beijing Backs Hong Kong Lockdown as Covid Crisis Worsens, Sources Say Multiple regulators, including the banking watchdog, recently told institutions under their oversight to closely examine all exposure they had to Ant, its subsidiaries and even its shareholders up to January, said the people, asking not to be identified as the matter is private. Those people described this as by far the most thorough and wide-ranging look into deals with Ant and said institutions were told they must report findings back as soon as possible. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which owns a third of Ant, slumped 5.1% at open in Hong Kong on Tuesday, nearing a fresh now since its listing in the city in 2019. It was unclear what triggered the new scrutiny or whether it will lead to any actions or conclusions by regulators, the people said. The National Audit Office is leading the initiative, two of the people said. The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission and the top auditor didn’t immediately respond to requests seeking comment. Ant declined to comment. More than a year after the Chinese government snuffed out the biggest initial public offering in history by Ant, Beijing has showed no letup in a crackdown that has snowballed into an assault on every corner of China’s technosphere. Officials have handed out billions of dollars in antitrust fines to end the domination of a few heavyweights as President Xi Jinping pushes for more “common prosperity.” Chinese technology shares slumped for a second session Monday, with Tencent Holdings Ltd. sinking 5.2% on Monday due to renewed fears Beijing may roll out more restrictions for private enterprise. Meituan lost $26 billion of market value on Friday after China issued new guidelines asking for food delivery platforms to cut fees, underscoring that investor angst over the nation’s tech giants remains high. The regulations and probes have pummeled the shares of firms such as Tencent, as well as dented their profits and growth and forced some to shelve listing plans. The Hang Seng Tech Index is trading near its lowest level versus its 12-month forward earnings and sales forecasts. Ant was hit the hardest among them all. Beijing scuttled the fintech giant’s $35 billion IPO in November 2020, ordering it to overhaul businesses including lending, insurance and wealth management, and set up a financial holding company so it could be regulated like a bank. As part of the restructuring, Ant has ramped up its capital base to 35 billion yuan ($5.5 billion) and moved to build firewalls in an ecosystem that once allowed it to direct traffic from Alipay, with a billion users, to services like wealth management, consumer lending and delivery. Consumer loans jointly made with banks were split from its “Jiebei” and “Huabei” brands. Assets under management at its money-market fund Yu’ebao -- once the world’s largest -- dropped by more than a third last year to 765 billion yuan by December. The process was delayed last month, however, after state-owned bad-debt manager China Cinda Asset Management Co. surprisingly backed out of a plan to take a major stake in Ant’s consumer finance unit. The fintech firm has yet to apply for a financial holding company license. A least a dozen Chinese banks have been paring their years-long cooperation with Ant on consumer lending since the clampdown. Meanwhile, the nation’s top anti-graft group in January made rooting out corruption tied to “disorderly expansion of capital” one of its priorities. A month later it arrested a former party chief of Hangzhou -- the home city of Ant and Alibaba -- on corruption charges, including using his influence to help his younger brother’s businesses. One of those companies had received investment from a firm controlled by Ma’s Ant, according to a local media report in August. Neither Ant nor Ma have been accused of wrongdoing related to the case. What Bloomberg Intelligence Says: “Beijing’s call for China’s banks to check their exposures to Jack Ma’s unlisted Ant Group may jeopardize the company’s ties with financiers for its online-loan business, with our scenario analysis suggesting its valuation could plunge to $63 billion vs. the $320 billion level targeted in the 2020 IPO.” --Francis Chan, banking & fintech analyst Click here for the research The myriad restrictions mean Ant is worth a fraction of its former self as its growth prospects wane, according to some of its early Wall Street backers. Fidelity Investments slashed its valuation estimate for at least the second time last year to about $78 billion as of June 30. Others are more optimistic: BlackRock Inc. values the company at $174 billion and T Rowe Price Group Inc. views it at $189 billion.

Greg Tournant and Stephen Bond-Nelson, who managed the Florida-based Structured Alpha hedge funds for Allianz Global Investors, were dismissed in December, regulatory filings show. A third manager involved in running the funds, Trevor Taylor, left at the same time, a person familiar with the matter said. Tournant was “discharged for violation of firm policies designed to ensure compliance with industry regulations and standards relating to the preparation and provision of client communications,” while Bond-Nelson’s position was terminated for a “violation of firm compliance policies,” regulatory filings show. It isn’t clear why Taylor departed. Tournant didn’t respond to a request for comment from Bloomberg News via LinkedIn. Calls and messages to phone numbers and email addresses listed as linked to him in a public database were unsuccessful. Bond-Nelson, Taylor and an AGI spokesman declined to comment. Their departures are the latest in a series of fund-manager exits at the insurance giant. Late last year, Allianz SE’s top asset-management executive, Jackie Hunt, also stepped down.

Allianz liquidated two of the vehicles in March 2020 and has been unwinding the others. The pain isn’t expected to end there. Allianz has warned that probes by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice are ongoing and further charges are likely.

2/22/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Emerging markets are standing firm despite escalating tension along the Ukrainian border, with investors more closely eyeing the impact of major central banks catching up on the global tightening cycle. Most Read from Bloomberg U.S. to Squeeze Harder Over Putin Separatist Nod: Ukraine Update Stocks Retreat, Ruble Weakens on Ukraine Tension: Markets Wrap Kremlin Cautious on Prospect of Biden-Putin Summit Amid Tensions Ponzi Schemer Bernie Madoff's Sister, Husband Found Dead Trump Holds Onto Piles of Cash, Gives None to GOP Candidates From stocks to local currencies, pockets of emerging markets are on the up. Aggressive central banks and high commodity prices are driving advances this year in more than half of the 24 developing-world currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Analysts have sent corporate earnings expectations to an eight-year high. And investor risk appetite is holding strong: South Africa, considered a bellwether for emerging-market risk, is the best performer this month in the local-currency debt market with total returns exceeding 6%. “Emerging-market assets have been fairly resilient through the past several months of elevated Russia-Ukraine tensions,” said Phoenix Kalen, head of emerging-market research at Societe Generale in London. “Increasingly, Russia is treated as an idiosyncratic story, which implies limited contagion risk into other emerging markets via the investor sentiment channel.” While Wall Street is closely watching developments in Moscow and Kyiv, some money managers say the more important development will be how much the Federal Reserve and other key central banks affect global growth by raising interest rates and pulling back the massive stimulus pumped into the financial system since the pandemic. “The big driver will be another war -- that war being global organic growth versus the tide of liquidity and fiscal stimulus receding in the global economy,” said Jack McIntyre, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management in Philadelphia, who said his base case is still that tensions between Russia and the West will ease. “Emerging-market assets have priced in a significant amount of bad news over the past decade and therefore we don’t think there will be a major repricing.” But deeper geopolitical risk is still there. Signs of a protracted and severe military conflict could shock global markets, growth and inflation. That’s been underscored in the past week as markets were whipsawed by reports signaling easing or escalating tensions. The U.S. said Russia has massed as many as 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. Listen: EM Weekly Podcast: Ukraine Tension; Korea Rates, Mexico Minutes While Russia told the U.S. it has no plans to attack, the Belarusian Defense Ministry said Russia and Belarus will extend their joint military drills, which were scheduled to end on Sunday. Most emerging-market currencies edged higher Monday on news of the proposed summit between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, according to statements from the White House and France. There was no immediate confirmation from the Kremlin. Political risk in Russia has risen every day since Nov. 7, according to a GeoQuant measure. Yet, it has coincided with a rally in emerging-market currencies that’s sent their benchmark gauge to the highest in eight months. That suggests traders’ optimism over successive interest-rate hikes may outweigh concern over the geopolitical tensions. Most Vulnerable Still, a spike in oil prices if Russia were to invade could lead to a performance gap between emerging-market energy importers and exporters. Already, elevated crude prices may linger due to supply-and-demand dynamics, which could underscore opportunities in the Middle East -- a region already showing robust credit fundamentals, said Anders Faergemann, London-based senior portfolio manager for global fixed income at PineBridge Investments, which manages $149 billion. For Societe Generale’s Kalen, central European currencies from Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania are among the most vulnerable to Russian escalation and could see selling if risk aversion grows in the region. Uncertainty has also hit Russian assets. The ruble is down more than 3% so far this year, but the largest U.S. exchange-traded fund tracking Russian equities, the VanEck Russia ETF (RSX), is fresh off five straight weeks of inflows. Such volatility hasn’t stopped BNP Paribas Asset Management or Legal & General Group Plc from hanging on to more bullish calls on regional assets. BNP is keeping its Russian and Ukrainian fixed-income holdings with a strategy to stay nimble by avoiding the 10-year part of the yield curve, said Jean-Charles Sambor, the firm’s head of emerging-markets fixed income in London. “My base case is that there is not a full invasion into Ukraine, but rather the ‘frozen conflict’ continues, as it has for the past eight years,” said Uday Patnaik, a London-based money manager at Legal & General Group Plc, who recently added to his holdings of dollar bonds issued by Kyiv-based Kernel Holding SA and MHP SE. “It is not new. It is one of the reasons that Ukraine trades relatively cheap.” Here are some the most important economic data events to watch this week: Chinese banks kept loan prime rates unchanged in February, according to a report Monday Thailand’s economy grew faster than expected last quarter, buoyed by rising exports and tourist arrivals, firming its recovery. Gross domestic product during October-December rose 1.9% from a year ago, versus the median estimate of 0.8% in a Bloomberg survey Stronger-than-expected government revenues in South Africa’s budget, to be released on Wednesday, could mask underlying fiscal risks, according to Bloomberg Economics Traders will watch a reading of Argentina’s December economic activity, as well as any developments on a deal with the International Monetary Fund Mexico is expected to release its final fourth-quarter gross-domestic product figures after preliminary data showed the economy fell into recession.

2/22/2022,"Crypto mining has been an area of intense regulatory and government scrutiny recently. Following China’s ban on Bitcoin (BTC) mining last summer, government chatter had been silent until the start of the year. In January, an energy crisis across Eastern Europe led to the Kosovo Government banning crypto mining. The government imposed a ban to curb energy consumption. By global standards, Kosovo only accounted for 0.01% of Bitcoin’s global hash rate in August 2021. According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, the U.S. was the largest, with a total Bitcoin mining hashrate of 35.4%.  As a result of the U.S ranking as the world’s largest Bitcoin miner, U.S Congress held a subcommittee hearing on Crypto-mining and the environment back in January. Bitcoin mining and Proof-of-Work protocols had a tough day of it on Capitol Hill. Other governments have also become vocal on Proof-of-Work mining in general. In January, European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) vice-chairman Erik Thedeen had called for a ban on Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining. Thedeen talked of the significant risks that mining poses to the environment. The ESMA vice chair added that EU regulators should encourage more environmentally friendly Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mining due to its significantly lower energy profile. Global agencies have also stepped forward, vocalizing concerns over mining and the environment. These include Fitch Ratings and the U.S Inland Revenue Services. With government and regulatory scrutiny heightened, there has been an even greater need for a more environmentally friendly Proof-of-Work Asic. In late January, we had reported an Intel (INTC) plan to enter the Bitcoin mining space. Intel planned to introduce a new “Ultra-Low-Voltage-Energy-Efficient Bitcoin Mining Asic”. Intel aimed to “reduce overall power consumption by approximately 15%.” According to the news wires, Intel unveiled the Bonanza Mine at the International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC). The conference runs from 20th to 28th February. The Intel first-generation Bonanza Mine Asic includes a 300 BMZ chip, with a 3,600 Watts (W) power rating while delivering 40 terahashes per second (TH/s) of computer power. While with less power than leading Asic miners, the Bonanza Mine Asic is reportedly more energy efficient. Big names have signed up for the more energy-efficient Intel miner. These include Argo and Block. On Wednesday, 23rd February, Intel will participate in a live Q&A session. For governments raising concerns over Proof-of-Work mining, it remains to be seen whether the Bonanza Mine will satisfy.

2/22/2022,"By Medha Singh and Lisa Pauline Mattackal (Reuters) - Bitcoin miners are feeling the heat - and the pain's rippling downstream to pressure prices. The cryptocurrency's spectacular rally in 2021 drew thousands of entrants into mining, or producing new coin. As a result the hashrate, or combined computational power used by bitcoin miners globally, has roughly quadrupled over the past six months to blow past 200 million ""terahashes"" per second. But what's that got to do with the price of bitcoin? A rising hashrate makes it becomes harder for miners to earn coin and cover their costs of hardware, electricity and staff - so many are more likely to sell, rather than hold, their newly minted cryptocurrency, exerting a bearish force on the market. ""Running costs are a major factor in miners' decision to hold or sell newly acquired coins. They are the first and most natural sellers in the crypto space and so definitely impact prices,"" said Justin d'Anethan, institutional sales director at crypto financial services firm Amber Group. The total value of coins held in miners' wallets has fallen to around $75 billion from $114 billion at the start of November, as their profitability has been squeezed by the rising hashrate as well as falling prices, according to Oslo-based crypto research firm Arcane Research. Miners have been transferring more coins to exchanges than adding to reserves, according to crypto industry analytics firms, a sign of selling or intent to sell. Such flows are adding to pressures facing bitcoin, whose drift towards the mainstream has seen it caught up in a selloff in global markets driven by tensions on the Ukraine border and the Federal Reserve's policy tightening. The world's dominant cryptocurrency is trading at about $37,400, which is 40% below its Nov. 10 high of $62,000. WHAT IT COSTS Bitcoin mining, in simple terms, is the process by which a network of computers checks and validates a block of transactions that then get added to the blockchain. Miners get rewarded for completing a block. It's an expensive business, though, requiring not just sophisticated and fast ""rigs"" costing upwards of $10,000, but also a huge amount of power. And it's getting pricier. The seven-day average of total mining cost per transaction validated has fallen to $176.8 from a record $235.57 hit in May last year, data from blockchain.com shows. ""As more miners join the network, each individually earns fewer bitcoin. This is because network difficulty increases in order to slow the issuance of new bitcoin,"" said Joe Burnett, analyst at infrastructure and mining firm Blockware Solutions. Waning mining profitability is also hitting the broader market because some institutional investors, who are unable or unwilling to invest directly in cryptocurrencies, instead buy shares of listed miners or ETFs that track miners as an alternative way of gaining access to the young industry. Shares of U.S.-listed crypto miners Marathon Digital Holdings and Riot Blockchain have plunged 66% and 52% respectively since early November. The Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF is meanwhile trading at a roughly 5% discount to its net asset value since the fund's launch in early February, and the Viridi Clean Energy Crypto-Mining & Semiconductor ETF has lost 23% since the beginning of the year. THE LAST BITCOIN Some of the pressures on miners flow from bitcoin's inherent structure. The decentralised blockchain was created anonymously with a final limit of 21 million coins, of which nearly 19 million has already been minted. It takes around 10 minutes to mine one block and the reward for miners - who currently get 6.25 bitcoin per block - is halved about every four years. ""There could be one miner or a million, it doesn't change anything. There's only one block and a set number of bitcoins issued,"" said d'Anethan at Amber Group. A final note: don't lose sleep fretting about what will happen when the last bitcoin is mined - that's not expected until the middle of the next century, 2140 to be exact.

2/22/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- A pile-up of inventories suggests that China’s metals consumption remains on the back-foot after disruptions to industrial activity during the Winter Olympics and Lunar New Year. Most Read from Bloomberg Kremlin Cautious on Prospect of Biden-Putin Summit Amid Tensions Ponzi Schemer Bernie Madoff's Sister, Husband Found Dead U.S. Says Biden-Putin Summit Agreed in Principle: Ukraine Update Stocks Retreat on Ukraine Tension, Ruble Weakens: Markets Wrap Trump Holds Onto Mountains of Cash, Gives None to GOP Candidates How quickly demand recovers now that the festivities are over, and whether consumers will accept relatively elevated prices, will help set the direction for markets in coming days and weeks. Although the central bank kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged on Monday, and declines in new home prices eased last month, there seems little doubt that Beijing stands ready to buttress demand against the backdrop of wider distress in the property sector and other indicators like slumping car sales. Among Chinese fabricators, the recovery in consumption has been slower than expected, with copper rod producers operating at just 59% of capacity last week, according to Shanghai Metals Market. A resurgence of Covid-19 cases in eastern China has also affected purchases, it said. That’s driven a spike in stockpiles. Copper held in warehouses tracked by the Shanghai Futures Exchange surged 28% last week and have more than quadrupled this year. Inventories of aluminum and zinc also extended gains. The Yangshan premium, an indicator of import demand for refined copper, is at its lowest since July. In ferrous markets, the slowdown in construction has lifted rebar inventory to a 10-month high, according to Steelhome. And iron ore stockpiles at Chinese ports haven’t been this strong since June 2018, despite the government’s campaign to prevent hoarding and cool prices. Still, Beijing’s efforts to keep markets like iron ore and coal in check surely presage broader fiscal stimulus that can only lift demand. In the meantime, steel mills in Hebei province are gearing up to restart production after curbs to combat pollution during the Olympics, according to Mysteel. Today’s Events (All times Beijing unless noted) Nothing major scheduled Today’s Chart Asia’s best-performing equity funds of last year have tumbled as their bets sour on renewables. Part of the problem is a mismatch in China “between green ambition and the reality of near-term dependency on traditional energy,” said Hao Hong, chief strategist at Bocom International.
