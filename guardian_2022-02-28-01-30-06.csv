2/28/2022,"Prince Charles has been given the green light to build a new school for farming in Scotland that will aim to draw in people who have no connection to agriculture to learn traditional skills including one of his private passions: hedgelaying. Planners have granted approval for an education centre at Home Farm at Dumfries House, the East Ayshire Palladian mansion operated by the Prince’s Foundation, one of Charles’ charities, after he stepped in to help save it in 2007. About 1,800 teenagers, school leavers and adult learners are expected to pass through the education centre each year. The move cements the heir to the throne’s continuing interest in rural affairs that observers expect him to continue to champion when he becomes king. It will also teach drystone walling and butchery and will include barns to teach livestock handling. Charles’ involvement with Dumfries House has recently led him to become mired in a donations for honours row. Scotland Yard is investigating allegations that a Saudi donor to the Prince’s Foundation was offered help to secure a knighthood. Clarence House has said the Prince of Wales had no knowledge of the alleged offer of honours on the basis of donations to his charities. The teaching complex, to be built at Home Farm on the 2,000-acre Scottish estate, will be built with materials salvaged or sourced locally, such as larch cladding boards. The south-facing part of the “education shed” will be covered with photovoltaic panels, with ground source heat pumps supplying warmth. “The underlying principle is to bring new talent into the farming and rural sector, specifically targeting those with no current connection to it,” said a design statement submitted to planners. “Delivery would be hands-on and practical, allowing students to immerse themselves in their subject area, giving them maximum opportunity to grow their knowledge, skills and passion for the industry”. Charles is chairman of the National Hedgelaying Society and has spent time practising the art on his own farm near Highgrove in Gloucestershire. In a speech to the society last December, he said: “Their ability to sequester carbon, help prevent flooding and soil erosion whilst providing stock control, shelter, green corridors and an abundance of food and protection for wildlife, make our hedgerows as precious a natural asset to our planet as any other I have experienced. And this is without recording their immense historical or cultural value as living history with some 30 different styles of hedgelaying to be seen across Britain.” “This development will allow The Prince’s Foundation to carry out important work in agricultural education at an impressive new facility next to Home Farm on Dumfries House estate, our headquarters,” said Gordon Neil, an executive director of the Prince’s Foundation. “Our charity already practises and passes on traditional and rural skills, and this new development will build on our work to encourage the next generation to learn such skills and consider careers in rural industries.”",News/UK news,Prince Charles gets go-ahead for farming school in Scotland,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/27/prince-charles-gets-go-ahead-for-farming-school-in-scotland
2/28/2022,"Tesco is to become the first of the main UK retailers to stop selling baby wipes containing plastic, which cause environmental damage as they block sewers and waterways after being flushed by consumers. The supermarket said it was stopping sales of branded baby wipes containing plastic from 14 March, about two years after it ceased using plastic in its own-brand products. The UK’s largest grocer is also the country’s biggest seller of baby wipes. Its customers purchase 75m packs of baby wipes every year, amounting to 4.8bn individual wipes. Tesco said it had been working to reformulate some of the other own-label and branded wipes its sells to remove plastic, including cleaning wipes and moist toilet tissue. It said its only kind of wipe that still contained plastic – designed to be used for pets – would also be plastic-free by the end of the year. Tesco began to remove plastic from its own-brand wet wipes in 2020, when it switched to biodegradable viscose, which it says breaks down far more quickly. Sarah Bradbury, Tesco’s group quality director, said: “We have worked hard to remove plastic from our wipes as we know how long they take to break down.” Tesco is not the first retailer to remove wipes from sale on environmental grounds. Health food chain Holland and Barrett said it was the first high-street retailer to ban the sale of all wet-wipe products from its 800 UK and Ireland stores in September 2019, replacing the entire range with reusable alternatives. The Body Shop beauty chain has also phased out all face wipes from its shops. It is estimated that as many as 11bn wet wipes are used in the UK each year, with the majority containing some form of plastic, many of which are flushed down the toilet, causing growing problems for the environment. Last November, MPs heard how wet wipes are forming islands, causing rivers to change shape as the products pile up on their banks, while marine animals are dying after ingesting microplastics. They are also a significant component of the fatbergs that form in sewers, leading to blockages that require complex interventions to remove. Tesco said any wipes it sold that could not be flushed down the toilet were clearly labelled “do not flush”. Nevertheless, environmental campaigners and MPs have long called on retailers to do more to remove plastics from their products and packaging. The supermarket said it was trying to tackle the impact of plastic waste as part of its “4Rs” packaging strategy, which involves it removes plastic waste where possible, or reducing it, while looking at ways to reuse more and recycle. The chain said it had opened soft plastic collection points in more than 900 stores, and had launched a reusable packaging trial with shopping service Loop, which delivers food, drink and household products to consumers in refillable containers.",News/Business,Tesco to stop selling baby wipes that contain plastic in first for UK supermarkets,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/27/tesco-to-stop-selling-baby-wipes-that-contain-plastic-uk
2/28/2022,"West Ham might appear outsiders in the top-four race but they are not going away. They needed to beat Wolves in order for that to hold true and did so deservedly, winning through Tomas Soucek’s first goal in two months and moving fifth. The Czech midfielder’s close-range prod in the 59th minute came as a largely cautious Wolves appeared to have dulled the home side’s threat; the visitors were undone in London for the second time in under 72 hours and their hopes of gatecrashing the Champions League places now appear highly fanciful. For David Moyes it was a welcome response to a frustrating spell and, given sixth-placed Arsenal’s three games in hand come against fellow contenders at the top, he will feel their chances remain realistic. Moyes made two changes to the starting XI that drew disappointingly with Newcastle eight days ago, although the absence of one of West Ham’s substitutes felt a more pressing matter. Andriy Yarmolenko was given compassionate leave on Friday in light of the war unfolding in his native Ukraine and his manager had said he was “not in a really good position at the moment”. As the teams lined up side by side before kick-off, Declan Rice held a “Yarmolenko 7” shirt in front of him. A message on the scoreboard in Ukrainian yellow and blue read: “Sending love and prayers to Andriy Yarmolenko and the people of Ukraine.” Football pales far into insignificance when set alongside the horror Yarmolenko and his compatriots are experiencing. In its specific and narrow context, this fixture felt particularly important to both teams. They have lost ground in the top-four battle in recent weeks and neither could really afford to lose. Wolves had been badly bruised by an added-time defeat against Arsenal three days previously and it was no surprise to see Bruno Lage make five changes to the side that finally buckled in the 95th minute at the Emirates. It hardly took an expert to predict proceedings between two efficient and expertly-drilled sides would be tight. What openings arose in the first half mainly fell to West Ham, who will have felt they had done enough to go ahead. Aaron Cresswell crossed just beyond a lunging Jarrod Bowen in the sixth minute and, midway through, curled a free-kick just wide. José Sá, whose unfortunate own goal had secured that pointless return from north London, was called upon to make amends on a couple of occasions and did so. When Bowen rounded him at the tightest angles, Sá was able to pluck the resulting chip out of the air. Just before the half-hour there was rather more to do when Michail Antonio, found in the right of the box by Soucek, drilled towards the near post and demanded a smart parry. Antonio was then not quite positioned to capitalise after Sá had flipped Ben Johnson’s cross behind him. West Ham were knocking at the door and Rice beat Sá with a glorious whipped effort from 20 yards, only to see it rebound off the far post. There had been almost no threat from Wolves, who had started Fábio Silva up front in place of Raúl Jiménez but saw him waste one glorious counterattacking opportunity, until the stroke of half-time. When they created a chance it was a good one, Hwang Hee-chan running onto a loose ball after some desperate defending but placing wide from 15 yards. Wolves had suffered at Arsenal after retreating into their shell, which always felt ill-advised on the night given they had looked inventive in attack. In a further suggestion that they had at least loosened the shackles, Francisco Trincão shot over with the first significant action of the second half. Soon they would be given no choice. West Ham had been kept at arm’s length since the interval but, as the hour approached, Soucek marked his 27th birthday with a strike that could look crucial at the season’s end. A neat move following a throw-in saw Pablo Fornals backheel to Cresswell, who found Antonio via a deflection off Rúben Neves. Antonio centred low from the left of the area and Soucek, sticking out a long leg, diverted past Sá. Silva squeezed a shot wide as Wolves sought instant parity but in the next dozen minutes they should have been sent packing. Slick play from Fornals created a clear chance to Bowen, who ought to have taken it with his right foot but prodded uncertainly with his left. Then Antonio spun Conor Coady scintillatingly on halfway, proceeding to outsprint Max Kilman and seemingly set himself up for one of the season’s better solo goals. Going for the unselfish option with Sá to beat, he attempted to locate Bowen but saw Wolves scramble clear. The goalmouth action more or less ended there. Lukasz Fabianski was equal to the little Wolves could muster and Moyes could greet the whistle with arms aloft.",Sport/Football,West Ham revive top-four challenge as Tomas Soucek delivers win over Wolves,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/27/west-ham-wolves-premier-league-match-report

2/28/2022,"The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has urged the Conservative peer and former minister Greg Barker to quit his lucrative role on the board of the Russian aluminium firm EN+, whose owners include the oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Lord Barker, an energy minister in David Cameron’s government, earned $4m last year as executive chair of the firm, and devised a plan to help the company respond to US government sanctions levelled against the company and Deripaska in 2018. In 2018, the US government sanctioned Deripaska over his alleged links to the Russian government. It also designated EN+ because of its ownership by Deripaska, who has previously said the US allegations were based on “false rumour and innuendo”. Asked whether Barker should quit the Lords or the company, Wallace told the Mail on Sunday: “He should quit all of them.” He added: “I think Lord Barker should explain why he works with people like Deripaska.” Wallace’s aide later clarified he meant Barker should quit the company. The intervention follows calls last week from Chris Bryant, the Labour MP and chair of the parliamentary committee on standards, for Barker to step down from the role. The call comes amid rising pressure on western businesses and political leaders to sever ties with companies with links to the Russian government, amid the war in Ukraine. Last week, Esko Aho, the former prime minister of Finland, quit the board of Russian bank Sberbank, and Matteo Renzi, Italy’s ex-prime minister, walked away from his role at Delimobil, one of Russia’s largest car-sharing services. EN+ says it is the largest aluminium producer outside China and it also operates power networks in Siberia. It employs 90,000 people and was built up through acquisitions by Deripaska, 54, of aluminium and power-producing companies. In 2008, Deripaska was named Russia’s richest man in by Forbes magazine. That same year, the then shadow chancellor, George Osborne, met Deripaska at Davos and again on holiday in Corfu with Nat Rothschild and Peter Mandelson, sparking a controversy over discussions about Deripaska or his companies potentially donating to the Conservative party. Last year, it was reported that Osborne had won business for the investment bank for which he now works from a subsidiary of EN+. Barker joined the board of EN+ in 2017 and the US introduced sanctions against the firm in 2018. But these were dropped after Deripaska gave up his controlling stake under a plan overseen by Barker to bring Deripaska’s shareholding below 50%. The peer, who has taken a leave of absence from the House of Lords, ​​became the company’s executive chair in 2019. In 2019, he was paid $7.8m in salary and bonuses, according to the firm’s accounts.

2/28/2022,"Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar, members of Congress who spoke at a white nationalist event in Florida this week, are “morons” with no place in the Republican party, Mitt Romney said on Sunday. “I’m reminded of that old line from the Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid movie,” the Utah senator and 2012 presidential nominee told CNN’s State of the Union. “One character says, ‘Morons. I’ve got morons on my team.’ I have to think anybody that would sit down with white nationalists and speak at their conference was certainly missing a few IQ points.” Greene, from Georgia, and Gosar, from Arizona, spoke at the America First Political Action Conference, or AFPAC, organised by the far-right activist Nick Fuentes. Greene defended her attendance, saying she did not know Fuentes or endorse his views. Calls for the censure of the two Republicans, familiar from previous instances of extreme behaviour, rang out again on Saturday. Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee, said: “In any other world, Greene speaking at a white supremacist conference where attendees have defended Vladimir Putin and praised Adolf Hitler would warrant expulsion from the caucus, to say nothing of her advocacy for violence and consistent antisemitism is disgusting. “Quite simply, the longer [House Republican leader] Kevin McCarthy gives Marjorie Taylor Greene an unfettered platform and promises to elevate her, the more complicit he is.” The Republican party chair, Ronna McDaniel, said: “White supremacy, neo-Nazism, hate speech and bigotry are disgusting and do not have a home in the Republican party.” But McDaniel and McCarthy lead a party in which the far right is strong, former president Donald Trump its figurehead. McDaniel is Romney’s niece, though she reportedly stopped using his name at Trump’s request. On CNN, Romney mentioned McDaniel’s statement about Greene and Gosar as well as strong words from Liz Cheney, the Wyoming Republican congresswoman and Trump critic. “Talking about how repugnant these white nationalists are,” Romney said, “look, there’s no place in either political party for this white nationalism or racism. it’s simply wrong. “Speaking of evil, it’s evil as well. And, you know, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar, I don’t know them.” Cheney is a stringent conservative but remains at odds with her party. She was not invited to CPAC, the larger conservative event in Florida at which Trump and Greene appeared. In video posted online, Vaughn Hillyard, a reporter for NBC, asked CPAC organiser Matt Schlapp why Greene had been invited despite her long record of extremist behaviour and her participation in the white nationalist event. “I think it’s great that Marjorie Taylor Greene was on this stage because she was elected by her constituents to have a vote in Congress,” Schlapp said. “[House speaker] Nancy Pelosi decided to strip her of her rights as a congressperson to serve on these committees and Twitter has decided to shut her down.” Hillyard said: “But you’re inviting legitimacy to that white nationalist movement that was just down the road when a member of Congress from the Republican party appears at that event and you bring her here.” Schlapp said: “I’m providing legitimacy to you and your network by being allowed to be in this room. It’s called the first amendment and you are a member of the press and you have a right to be in this room. If I had said you couldn’t come into this room, how would that make America better?” Hillyard asked: “Did you extend an invite to Liz Cheney?” Schlapp said: “No.”",News/US news,Romney: Marjorie Taylor Greene a ‘moron’ for speaking at white nationalist event,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/27/mitt-romney-marjorie-taylor-greene-paul-gosar-morons
2/28/2022,"Sonny Ramadhin, whose beguiling spin-bowling helped West Indies to their first Test series victory in England in 1950, has died at the age of 92.Born in Trinidad in 1929, Ramadhin was the first man of Indian heritage to represent the region in cricket and a star of his time, claiming 158 wickets from 43 Test matches during a 10-year international career.His partnership with Alf Valentine, the Jamaican slow left-armer, was legendary, never more so when the pair first came together in England in 1950; they shared 59 victims as a West Indies team also containing the three Ws - Frank Worrell, Everton Weekes and Clyde Walcott - made its presence felt on the world stage with a 3-1 series triumph.The feat was immortalised on both sides of the Atlantic in the song Victory Calypso. Its composer, Lord Beginner, was among the first arrivals on the HMS Windrush in 1948 and part of the jubilant supporters who celebrated on the Lord’s outfield after Ramadhin’s match figures of 11 for 152 set up a 326-run win in the second Test. A surprise pick that year aged 21 and after just two appearances for Trinidad, Ramadhin became a dominant force through his ability to turn the ball both ways, taking his 758 first-class wickets at an average of 20.24 and finishing with 51 five-wicket hauls.The news of Ramadhin’s passing was first announced on Sunday morning by Friarmere CC, the Pennine Cricket League club in Delph, Oldham, where he was president.Ramadhin had settled in the north-west of England after his playing days, having featured in the Lancashire league, played two seasons for Lancashire in the 1960s and then enjoyed a further spell with Lincolnshire in the Minor Counties Championship. His grandson, the former seamer Kyle Hogg, also played for Lancashire.Tributes are expected during England’s latest tour of the Caribbean and the three-match Test series for the renamed Richards-Botham trophy that starts in Antigua on 8 March.

2/28/2022,"These are challenging times. The reconstruction job from Covid-19 had barely begun when Russia invaded Ukraine. Now the international consensus to build back better from the pandemic has been replaced by an urgent need to stop the conflict and prevent it escalating. With such high stakes, economic sanctions not bombs are the western weapon of choice, limiting Vladimir Putin’s ability to muster guns and butter. But while there will be harsher consequences for Russia, made a pariah under the Putin regime, it is a battle not without economic collateral damage. European leaders will this week announce a strategy to cut Europe’s reliance on Russian energy – a plan in the works before the first tank rolled into Ukraine, now given added urgency. With Russia accounting for 40% of EU gas imports – rising to 65% in Germany and 100% for some eastern European states – it is a prudent move. Yet it is a process likely to take years. In the meantime, the shock of war will drive up energy prices across the continent – adding to what was already the worst squeeze on living standards in decades. In Britain the inflationary surge could lead to the sharpest annual fall in living standards since at least 1956, the year of the Suez crisis. Not even the oil price shocks of the 1970s or the 2008 financial crisis come close, witnessed as the fallout from Covid holds back recovery from the worst recession in a century. The fact that such a squeeze will result is damning. Inflation is forecast to peak close to 8% this year, but that is still less than half the rate seen four decades earlier, when it hit almost 23% in 1975. Instead, today’s cost of living crisis is not only inflationary but also stems from weaker rates of wage growth, made worse by harsh benefit cuts hitting the poorest in society. The big difference in the 1970s was worker power, with higher rates of trade union membership enabling employees to demand higher wage settlements to deal with rising costs. Despite the record postwar inflation rate, pay growth rocketed by 29% in 1975. It was two years later in 1977, when wage growth of 11% was outpaced by inflation of 15%, that set the previous record for the worst year for growth in living standards since Suez. At the Bank of England the concern is that a rerun of the 1970s would lead to a wage-price spiral, when workers demanding higher pay leads to companies raising their prices to accommodate a higher wage bill, in an unsustainable game of leapfrog. Such a process would hurt those with the least bargaining power, and is a big fear today for the Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey. Back then, central banks ramped up interest rates to eye-watering levels to spike inflation, alongside western governments embracing neoliberalism and global trade and tackling worker power. Such an option would lack credibility today. The inflation shock of the 2020s comes with trade union membership and headline rates of income and corporation tax half what they were in the 1970s. Globalisation has peaked, public utilities are in private hands, while support is limited for slashing employment rights and product standards. Central banks are particularly hamstrung, as changes to interest rates take time to fully feed through to the economy. As Ben Broadbent, the Bank’s deputy governor, pointed out last week, getting ahead of our current energy-driven inflation shock would have required action in the summer of 2020. Against this backdrop, it is unthinkable that the government’s recent package of energy support measures will prove the last word in insulating households from the worst cost of living crisis since the mid-1950s. However, Westminster sources suggest Rishi Sunak is not preparing any tax and spending changes to announce at next month’s spring forecast statement. The chancellor is due only to deliver economic and fiscal forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility to meet legal requirements for a biannual update. Sunak will probably give a narrative of recent progress and vision for the future; talking up the government’s management of the economy as prudent in challenging times, with a promise made for lower taxes in future. The news is expected to be positive, with the OBR likely to update its forecasts for 2021-22 to show public borrowing of about £20bn less than forecast in October. However, the chancellor will face growing demands to loosen the purse strings in response to the conflict in Ukraine and its knock-on consequences for UK households and businesses. Calls will be made from left and right, with the national insurance hike planned for April and plans for fuel duty likely to animate his backbenchers. There will be demands to bolster defence spending and calls to invest in diversifying the UK’s energy supplies. While rightwing Conservatives will push for an embrace of fracking and domestic oil and gas, the climate emergency means that turning away from the green transition must be avoided. The biggest short-term demand, however, will be on insulating households from a further rise in their energy bills. Poverty campaigners warn the benefits system is the best mechanism for helping those most in need. At present the government plans to uprate benefits by just 3.1% in April – less than half the forecast rate of inflation – in a real-terms cut for the poorest families in the country at a time when the UK’s main out-of-work support is already the least generous in 30 years following a decade of cuts. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation estimates 400,000 people could be pulled into poverty by this real-terms cut. Still, rather than tackle this head on, the government last week bizarrely chose to make matters worse – announcing the end of pandemic support measures that will leave Britain with among the most miserly sick pay regimes in the western world. With the dust still settling from Covid-19 and the government waging economic warfare against Russia, more needs to be done to prevent the worst hit to living standards for more than half a century.",News/Business,Sunak must offer more support to counteract collateral damage of sanctions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/sunak-must-offer-more-support-to-counteract-collateral-damage-of-sanctions
