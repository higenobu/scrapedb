4/19/2022,"Amid its struggles in Ukraine, Russia's military has relied heavily on its most highly trained troops. The fighting has taken a outsize toll on those troops, including Russia's famed Spetsnaz special operators. Moscow may rely on those operators even more as it renews its campaign with a focus on eastern Ukraine. Russian forces have struggled in Ukraine, failing to achieve any of their primary objectives after two months of fighting. Moscow has reduced its ambitions, focusing on eastern Ukraine. It appears to be renewing its offensive, but its performance has already affected assessments of its military prowess, calling into question its status as a ""near peer"" force. Among the Russian units affected are the famed Spetsnaz. During and after the Cold War, these special operators achieved legendary status in the West. Recent successes in Crimea and Syria seemed to add to their credentials. Alongside the rest of the Russian military, however, their reputation is being tarnished in Ukraine. The city of Irpin, only miles from Kyiv, was a base Russian special-operations forces until Ukrainian forces ousted the Russians in late March. The brutal fight for the port city of Mariupol — the kind of strategic target where Moscow has concentrated its most capable forces — appears to have taken an outsize toll on Russia's special operators. Moscow established the Spetsnaz, its first special-operations unit, in the 1950s to conduct strategic missions. Spetsnaz initially had a strategic role, but now every special-operations unit in the Russian military, law enforcement, and emergency and security services are called Spetsnaz. In general, military Spetsnaz units are a light infantry airborne force that can act as shock troops. A few elite Spetsnaz units, such as Alpha and Vympel Groups, have strategic missions, such as counterterrorism, counterproliferation, and the security of nuclear installations. There has been limited reporting on what Russian special-operations units have done in Ukraine or how they've performed, but their missions there may include special reconnaissance, direct-action operations, and unconventional warfare. One of the few advantages that Russia's military has leveraged against Ukraine is its long-range weapons. Russia has launched more than 1,500 ballistic and cruise missiles at Ukrainian targets. Russian special operators could infiltrate close to those targets and use specialized equipment to help guide the munition. Moscow's utter disregard for collateral damage means it may not be using such targeting assistance, but that skill set could still be used if the Kremlin wants to take out the Ukrainian leadership with a strategic strike. Russian special-operations forces might also be conducting direct-action operations, such as raids and ambushes, in pursuit of tactical-level goals, such as capturing a city block. Generally, it would be folly to use special operators for conventional operations, as their potential casualties would squander the time and expense used to train them to a high level, but the lack of progress may prompt Russian commanders to do so, especially in urban settings where the close-quarters-combat training of Russian commandos might make the difference between winning and losing. Russia may also use its special-operations forces for unconventional warfare and asymmetric operations. Russian forces have been supporting separatist forces in eastern Ukraine for years, and that effort may expand as Moscow redirects its military campaign toward that region. Russian special operators may also target Ukrainian strategic targets, such as airfields or fuel and arms depots. There have already been reports of Russian naval commandos attacking a Ukrainian military intelligence ship. When it comes to special-operations forces, the Russian military has had ample opportunity to learn from the US. For the past 20 years, US special operators have been at the tip of the spear. Their ability to conduct high-reward missions with less military or political risk than larger conventional units has made them a go-to option for American policymakers. Russia's military began a major reorganization in 2008, part of which was the formation of a dedicated special-operations command organization. Created in 2009, the Russian Special Operations Forces Command is a strategic-level special-operations organization tasked with the hardest, most important missions. ""The Russians aren't stupid. They would have seen how successful we've been employing SOF [special-operations forces] downrange during the GWOT [Global War on Terror] and have taken their notes. That's what we would do,"" a retired Delta Force operator told Insider. What Russian forces have learned in terms of military doctrine isn't apparent, but open-source information showed ""how our operations have influenced their equipment and training,"" said the retired operator, speaking anonymously because they still work with their unit. ""It's funny because sometimes it's hard to distinguish between an American and Russian operator because they tend to both wear MultiCam [camouflage], high-cut helmets, and carry similar assault loadouts. It's only from the weapons that you can really tell the difference,"" the former operator added. Moscow drew on the creation of the US's Joint Special Operations Command, which is a component of US Special Operations Command, as a model for its new command. Although smaller than Russia's new command, JSOC contains the US military's special missions units, the most elite special-operations organizations that comprise the US national mission strike force. Moscow wanted to replicate the effectiveness of the JSOC, bringing together its top special-operations units to facilitate better command and control. Even Spetsnaz units from the GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency, were transferred to the new organization, though they were reassigned to the GRU in 2013. ""People in SOF tend to be cut from the same cloth. The training, mission sets, and funding might be different — and in some cases worlds apart — but the people at the highest levels tend to be very similar,"" the retired operator said.

4/19/2022,"By Maria Starkova and Pavel Polityuk LVIV/KYIV, April 19 (Reuters) - Ukraine said Russia had started an anticipated new offensive in the east of the country, with explosions reported all along the front lines as well as attacks in other regions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia had begun the ""Battle of Donbas"" in the east on Monday and a ""very large part of the entire Russian army is now focused on this offensive."" ""No matter how many Russian troops they send there, we will fight. We will defend ourselves,"" he vowed in a video address. Zelenskiy's chief of staff Andriy Yermak called it ""the second phase of the war"" and assured Ukrainians that their forces could hold off the offensive. ""Believe in our army, it is very strong,"" he said. Ukrainian media reported a series of explosions, some powerful, along the front line in the Donetsk region, with shelling taking place in Marinka, Slavyansk and Kramatorsk. Ukrainian local officials and local media also said explosions were heard in Kharkiv in the northeast of Ukraine, Mykolaiv in the south and Zaporizhzhia in the southeast. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the reports. Ukrainian officials said Russian shelling killed four people in the Donetsk region on Monday, while a man and a woman were killed in Kharkiv when shells hit a playground near a residential building. They said a Russian missile attack also killed seven people in Lviv, the first civilian victims in the western city about 60 km (40 miles) from Poland. Ukraine's top security official, Oleksiy Danilov, said Russian forces attempted to break through Ukrainian defences ""along almost the entire front line of Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions"" on Monday morning. Driven back by Ukrainian resistance in the north, Moscow has refocused its ground offensive in the two eastern provinces known as the Donbas, while launching long-distance strikes at other targets including the capital, Kyiv. Donbas has been the focal point of Russia's campaign to destabilise Ukraine, starting in 2014 when the Kremlin used proxies to set up two separatist ""people's republics"" in the ex-Soviet state. It is also home to much of Ukraine's industrial wealth, including coal and steel. Russia's defence ministry said it had hit hundreds of military targets in Ukraine overnight. It said air-launched missiles had destroyed 16 military facilities in the Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions and in the port of Mykolayiv, which are in south and east Ukraine. It added that the Russian air force had launched strikes against 108 areas where Ukrainian forces were concentrated and Russian artillery struck 315 Ukrainian military targets. BIDEN TO HOST CALL WITH ALLIES Western capitals and Kyiv accuse Russian President Vladimir Putin of unprovoked aggression, and the White House said U.S. President Joe Biden would hold a call with allies on Tuesday to discuss the Ukraine crisis, including on how to coordinate on holding Russia accountable. The United Nations said on Monday the war's civilian death toll had surpassed 2,000, reaching 2,072 as of midnight on April 17 from the start of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24. About 4 million Ukrainians have fled the country. Russia denies targeting civilians in what it calls a special operation to demilitarise Ukraine and eradicate dangerous nationalists. It rejects what Kyiv says is evidence of atrocities, saying Ukraine has staged them to undermine peace talks. Last week, Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the aid to include heavy artillery ahead of the expected Russian assault in the east. The U.S. military expects to start training Ukrainians on using howitzers in coming days, a senior U.S. defence official said, adding that this would take place outside Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron said his dialogue with Putin had stalled after mass killings were discovered in Ukraine. 'HELL ON EARTH' Russia has been trying to take full control of the southeastern port city of Mariupol, which has been besieged for weeks and which would be a huge strategic prize, linking territory held by pro-Russian separatists in the east with the Crimea region that Moscow annexed in 2014. Major Serhiy Volyna, commander of Ukraine's 36th marine brigade in Mariupol, appealed for help in a letter to Pope Francis, saying women and children were trapped among fighters in the city's steel works. ""This is what hell looks like on earth ... It’s time (for) help not just by prayers. Save our lives from satanic hands,"" the letter said, according to excerpts tweeted by Ukraine's Vatican ambassador. At least 1,000 civilians were hiding in underground shelters beneath the vast Azovstal steel plant, the city council said. Video and audio footage showed explosions rumbling and smoke rising from the steelworks, which contain myriad buildings, blast furnaces and rail tracks. Azovstal is the main remaining Ukrainian stronghold in Mariupol. The city's defenders include Ukrainian marines, motorised brigades, a National Guard brigade and the Azov Regiment, a militia created by far-right nationalists that was later incorporated into the National Guard. Russia's invasion has damaged or destroyed up to 30% of Ukraine's infrastructure at a cost of $100 billion, a Ukrainian minister said on Monday.
