1/14/2022,"An inquiry into lockdown parties in Downing Street, which could determine the fate of Boris Johnson, is expected to lay bare a “farcical” culture of drinking and impromptu socialising, with little oversight from senior officials, the Guardian understands. Whitehall sources said the investigation, overseen by the senior civil servant Sue Gray, was also likely to unearth other drinks events across government buildings as special advisers and officials were encouraged to “come clean” about breaches of lockdown rules.  Gray’s report is being anxiously awaited by Conservative MPs, some of whom have already called for Johnson to resign after he was forced to apologise for attending a “bring your own booze” gathering in the No 10 garden on 20 May 2020 – claiming he believed it was a “work event”. The prime minister’s fate may now lie in the hands of Gray, who is understood to still be gathering evidence amid claims from Labour that Johnson’s explanation and half-apology was unbelievable. Johnson ducked out of a public engagement in Lancashire on Thursday after a close family member tested positive for Covid. While self-isolation for contacts of coronavirus cases is no longer mandatory, Johnson’s spokesman said the prime minister would heed guidance to limit outside contacts as much as possible for seven days after the test. “In line with the guidance, he’s reducing contact. He’ll be working from No 10, doing daily tests and limiting contact with others both outside No 10 and indeed inside No 10 as well,” they said. Several Tory MPs, including the party’s leader in Scotland, Douglas Ross, said Johnson should resign immediately after he gave his account of the lockdown-busting drinks event. It emerged on Thursday that Boris Johnson will not be involved in this spring’s Scottish Conservative conference – an unprecedented snub for a UK leader of the party. A Scottish Tory source said: “I don’t see a way he could be involved really.” Few other MPs have so far publicly joined Ross’s call for Johnson to go; but many are now awaiting the findings of Gray’s investigation before deciding whether they can continue to back the prime minister. Sources said that Gray’s team – based in the Cabinet Office – was still gathering evidence about the drinks parties in Whitehall. These include an alleged Christmas party and a Zoom quiz in December 2020, as well as gatherings in the garden on 15 and 20 May. It is understood that the team are examining the culture and the management structures within No 10. Sources said the inquiry’s staff believe that No 10’s structures are “farcical”. The disclosures, which will call into question the management of No 10 by Johnson and the cabinet secretary Simon Case, come as Johnson’s cabinet allies took to the airwaves to defend him. The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, endorsed the idea that the prime minister might not have actually done anything wrong, saying his apology had been over what the public “perceived had happened”. She also argued that it was a good public health decision to have used the Downing Street garden for gatherings. “I don’t accept that he’s in the wrong,” Dorries told Sky News. “What I support the prime minister in is his apology. He said very clearly that he understood the upset and the anger that people felt at what they perceived had happened, and what had been reported. But what we all want is the inquiry to conclude. Priti Patel, another staunch Johnson loyalist, appeared to argue the event in the No 10 garden had been part of a “24/7 government working night and day at the height of a pandemic”. “He was thanking staff,” the home secretary told Sky. “Let’s not forget that was in May 2020, at the time when there was a lot of work.” Gray’s inquiry will assess why no one saw fit to stop the 20 May gathering, after the prime minister’s principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, sent out an invitation to staff to “socially distanced drinks”. Among the questions that will be asked is why no one felt able to “blow the whistle” on Reynold’s party invitations, even though several people believed that they broke Covid regulations. The report is expected to lay out a series of factual statements about the drinks parties, when and where they took place, how many people attended them, and, crucially, their purpose. This will then be compared with the guidelines at the time. In theory, Gray could recommend that Johnson is investigated under the ministerial code. But if she does so, Johnson would have to decide whether to launch an inquiry into his own alleged rule breaches. The Metropolitan police confirmed in a statement that they would not launch their own investigation into events in Downing Street in May 2020 unless Gray found evidence of rule-breaking. “The Met has ongoing contact with the Cabinet Office in relation to this inquiry. If the inquiry identifies evidence of behaviour that is potentially a criminal offence it will be passed to the Met for further consideration.” One former cabinet minister suggested that even if the prime minister is not explicitly condemned in Gray’s report, Tory MPs could move against him, with key council elections looming. “We’re heading for an absolute hammering in May. I think colleagues will want to act before then,” they said. Gray’s appointment to head the inquiry came amid a panicky atmosphere in Downing Street, insiders claim. Case stood down in mid-December after allegations emerged of a drinks event taking place within his own office. A Tory adviser who attended meetings in Downing Street during the pandemic contrasted the lax Covid safety regime in the building with the much tougher rules in place elsewhere across government that saw many people working from home. “In No 10 they were told they had to be in: it was a totally different attitude. That was why Covid ripped through that building. There was no testing, there were no bubbles. You can understand why the party happened when you understand that broader culture.” Another senior Tory who previously worked in Downing Street said opening a bottle of wine at the desk was not unusual if people were working into the evening, particularly on a Friday.",News/Politics,"No 10 party inquiry will reveal ‘farcical’ culture, say Whitehall sources",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/13/no-10-party-inquiry-will-reveal-farcical-culture-say-whitehall-sources
1/14/2022,"Navient, one of the largest student loan servicing companies in the US, has made a $1.85bn settlement with a coalition of attorneys general who accused the company of predatory loan practices. The payment, which will go toward the cancellation of certain student loans and payouts, settles a series of lawsuits that date back to 2017. Multiple states accused Navient of directing students toward repayment plans with exorbitant interest rates, specifically targeting students with poor credit who were attending for-profit schools with low graduation rates.  Under the settlement, 66,000 from 39 states and Washington DC, many who attended for-profit schools and have already defaulted on their loans, will have their debts cancelled, according to the Washington Post. Another 350,000 federal loan borrowers who were placed under specific types of long-term forbearances will receive a portion of the settlement – worth $260 a borrower – as part of the company’s payout. In total, Navient is expected to pay $1.7bn in loan cancellation and $95m in payouts. “The predatory practices used by Navient exploited students who wanted nothing more than an education. The company placed borrowers in risky subprime loans, causing them to incur debts they could never repay,” said Michigan attorney general Dana Nessel, one of the attorneys general who sued Navient, in a statement on Thursday. “This settlement reflects accountability for affected borrowers across the country.” The attorneys general accused Navient of encouraging students to enter into costly forbearances instead of directing them to better repayment plans to pay off their loans. Borrowers who enrolled in forbearances between January 2010 and March 2015 accumulated more than $4bn in interest after the forbearance plans saw accrued interest being added on to existing loan balances, according to the lawsuits. The bulk of the loans in question were serviced by the student loan company Sallie Mae, the loan servicing operations of which ultimately in 2014 branched off into Navient, which absorbed the liabilities of most of the assets tied to Sallie Mae’s loan servicing arm. Until last fall, Navient was the largest service provider of federal student loans under a contract with the Department of Education. In a large shakeup, Navient declined to renew its contract and opted to transfer its 5.6m federal loan accounts to Maximus, a different loan service operation. Despite the settlement, Navient denied any wrongdoing and said it had opted for a settlement in lieu of paying the cost of resolving each individual lawsuit. “This is really about eliminating a time-consuming, distracting and costly process,” Navient’s CEO, Jack Remondi, told the Washington Post. “With the ability to explicitly deny the claims that were made in these cases and borrower harm, I think it’s noteworthy that we’re not giving up on our defense here. We’re just agreeing that it’s time to move on.”",Lifestyle/Money,Navient reaches $1.85bn settlement over claims of predatory US student loans,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/13/navient-us-student-loan-debt-cancellation-settlement
1/14/2022,"You might think, in our age of safe spaces and “cowering” from Covid (in Sajid Javid’s coinage), there’d be mileage in Hanoch Levin’s 1970s comedy about condom selling, caution and risk-aversion. But Gamayun Theatre’s revival could itself be bolder – not least by curtailing the 160-minute running time. Its first half may dramatise a humiliating case of premature ejaculation, but under Asya Sosis’ direction, The Rubber Merchants suffers from the opposite problem, thrusting wearily onwards long after the pleasure has peaked. Forgive the coarseness – but it’s in keeping with Levin’s odd three-hander, in which two lecherous men talk endlessly about women’s beautiful backsides, and bawdy condom comedy dominates the first act. Maybe people found condoms funnier in the 1970s? (Sosis’ production is imprecise about both location and the period in which it’s set.) Certainly, the saucy humour obstructs the play’s ambition to conjure lives wistfully unlived and romantic opportunities missed.  It’s more fatal that the characters are two-dimensional at best. They’re broadly played: lascivious, money-grabbing Bella (Hadas Kershaw), who runs a failing pharmacy; her enfeebled suitor Yohanan (Tom Dayton); and swaggering Shmuel (Joseph Emms), who’s inherited 60,000 prophylactics from his dead dad. Fear keeps these characters from spending happy lives together, the play insists, contrary to the spectacle on stage of three caricatures with little in common, and not a spark of emotional connection between them. There are highlights, and hints of what might have been, in Shmuel’s pining for Odessa, his erotic Shangri-la, and in the songs performed on an upstage dais. From the comic to the plangent, these sometimes seductive numbers (music by Dmitriy Saratskiy) allow us to feel, now and then, what is only ever asserted elsewhere.

1/14/2022,"Good morning. Spiking Covid cases are disrupting goods needed for PCR testing. Nearly a quarter of the world’s population experienced a record hot year. And Novak Djokovic has been included in the Australian Open draw with a decision on his visa still pending. The impact of Covid-19 on supply chains has begun to disrupt goods needed for PCR testing, forcing the closure of clinics in one jurisdiction. The highly contagious Omicron variant has caused widespread staff shortages and a “crisis” in transport and other supply chain businesses, leading to shortages at supermarkets, retailers and other key industries. The supply chain issues are so severe that the Australian Capital Territory on Wednesday announced it was closing three testing clinics – a significant chunk of its testing capacity – until Monday. The federal health department bought $62m worth of rapid antigen tests earlier this week to cope. But small businesses and unions have condemned as inadequate Morrison’s response to a burgeoning staffing crisis caused by the Omicron wave. Meanwhile, business and unions say national cabinet’s response to the Omicron staffing crisis falls short.  The Queen has removed a range of military affiliations and royal patronages held by Prince Andrew, Buckingham Palace has said. The move, which includes the prince losing the use of “His Royal Highness”, comes after a United States judge gave the green light for her second son to face a sexual assault civil lawsuit. The move comes hours after more than 150 military veterans wrote to the Queen to ask her to strip Andrew of his honorary military roles amid what they described as their “upset and anger”. The palace had said earlier on Thursday that it had no comment on their open letter. Prince Andrew’s accuser, Virginia Giuffre, is unlikely to accept a “purely financial settlement” to end her sexual assault civil lawsuit against the royal, her lawyer has said. Novak Djokovic has been included in the Australian Open draw as the wait to see if his visa will be cancelled for a second time stretches into another day. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has suggested Djokovic will not be allowed to stay in the country and contest the Australian Open unless he can substantiate a medical exemption allowing him to be unvaccinated against Covid. Meanwhile, the Greek tennis player Stefanos Tsitsipas said Djokovic has been “playing by his own rules” and has put his bid for a 21st grand slam title at risk by not following Australia’s Covid-19 vaccination requirements. For the next three days, artists will dance on a 2.5 tonne block of ice suspended above Sydney harbour to draw attention to climate change. The art installation is part of this year’s Sydney festival. Australia has matched its hottest ever reliably recorded temperature, with Onslow airport near the remote Western Australia town of Onslow registering 50.7C. Many of Australia’s beaches are eroding due to urbanisation and industrialisation. While there are regeneration programs under way, fixing these beaches is no easy task. Indigenous communities argue that renaming landscapes should not be limited to removing overtly racist colonial names: restoring Aboriginal place names, they say, is key to recognising Indigenous histories. “Devastating” cuts to Medicare telehealth have left rural psychiatric patients in the lurch. From 1 January, the federal government removed a 50% loading for some rural psychiatric services, meaning a string of consultation providers are no longer able to bulk-bill their items. An Australian man has pleaded guilty to murdering a United States mathematician who fell from a Sydney cliff in 1988 in a homophobic hate crime that was dismissed by police at the time as suicide. Russia has refused to rule out a military deployment to Cuba and Venezuela if talks with the west on European security and Ukraine fail to go its way, while warning the latest discussions with Nato were hitting a dead end. Humanitarian organisations in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia are running perilously low on food and fuel stocks as an intensified wave of airstrikes further hampers a threadbare aid effort already stymied by lack of access. Nearly a quarter of the world’s population experienced a record hot year in 2021, as the climate crisis continues to unleash escalating temperatures around the globe, according to new data from leading US climate scientists. Dozens of journalists and human rights defenders in El Salvador have been subjected to “jaw-dropping” phone hacks using the Pegasus spyware allegedly deployed by governments around the world against dissidents, reporters, diplomats and members of the clergy, according to internet security researchers. A German court has sentenced a Syrian former intelligence officer to life in prison in a case the United Nations rights chief said could lead to accountability for other perpetrators of the war’s “unspeakable crimes”. After independence in 1960, Senegal cast off western influences and forged a new African style full of triangular forms, rocket-shaped obelisks and rammed earth. Is this spirit now being suffocated? Some travellers who spend longer periods of time in India exhibit a curious condition: a spectrum of behavioral and psychological changes that can be all-consuming. Known as the “India Syndrome”, the condition has cousins around the world: religious tourists to Jerusalem are struck with a spontaneous psychosis upon visiting the city, certain that they are hearing God; visitors to Florence are physically overcome upon viewing the beauty of the city’s art. But is it India that causes these transformations or do people go there determined to be transformed? “What is extraordinary about the last two weeks in Australia is not only the large numbers of people infected with Covid,” writes Brigid Delaney. “But the psychological volte-face required to withstand this new reality.” 2021 was an important year in the fight for gender equality, and the national women’s safety summit in September was a platform for experts and advocates to discuss key issues surrounding gender equality and violence against women and children. But Scott Morrison’s keynote address – and his failure to enact meaningful reform on key issues – left some underwhelmed and others furious.Political editor Katharine Murphy speaks to Laura Murphy-Oates about Australia’s ongoing cultural reckoning for women and how the Morrison government’s response to this was hamstrung by an “empathy gap”.

1/14/2022,"The Metropolitan police will not investigate alleged parties held at Downing Street in apparent breach of lockdown rules unless an upcoming inquiry finds evidence of criminality. The force said it does not normally investigate breaking of coronavirus regulations “long after they are said to have taken place”.  Senior civil servant, Sue Gray, is investigating allegations of parties held at Downing Street while the UK was in lockdown due to Covid-19. The force added that if this showed criminality took place then the police force would “reconsider” its stance. On Wednesday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, admitted attending a gathering at 10 Downing Street on 20 May 2020, during the height of the first UK coronavirus lockdown. An estimated 100 people were invited, with about 30 believed to have attended. Johnson said he was there for 25 minutes. When the event took place parties were banned and people were not able to see friends or family, even those unwell in hospital. A spokesperson for the Met said the force was “aware of widespread reporting relating to alleged breaches of the health protection regulations at Downing Street and Department for Education on various dates and has received correspondence in relation to this reporting”. It added: “The Met has ongoing contact with the Cabinet Office in relation to its inquiry. If the inquiry identifies evidence of behaviour that is potentially a criminal offence it will be passed to the Met for further consideration.” An inquiry announced by the prime minister and led by Gray will also look into a party allegedly held in No 10 when London was in tier 3 restrictions, which banned social events. Several dozen people – a mix of civil service and political staff – reportedly attended and were told to bring “secret Santa” presents, with cheese and wine laid on. The Met has previously been criticised for not taking action and “deferring to the powerful” against parties that took place. The Good Law Project has already started legal proceedings over the Met’s refusal to investigate reports of the Christmas party on 18 December 2020. The campaign group said that in letters between it and the Met, police said they had “relied on the government’s assurances that no rules had been broken” and “there would have been no point in interviewing No 10 staff about the parties because they would have refused to answer questions that exposed them to a risk of prosecution”. Jolyon Maugham, the director of the Good Law Project, said: “You can have the rule of law, or you can defer to the powerful. But you can’t have both. Cressida Dick’s cat will know that multiple criminal offences were committed. It shames the Met, and ultimately all of us, that she refuses to investigate.” Police officers who saw laws broken while on guard duty at Downing Street would be expected to report it, former Scotland Yard police chief Robert Quick said this week. He said: “The garden at Downing Street would be monitored by police officers. You would have thought the police would be reasonably aware of what was going on there.” Asked if officers could be told by their bosses to prioritise their protective duties and ignore the law, Quick said: “You could not give that advice to a police officer.” The Green party peer Lady Jones said the invitation to the May 2020 garden party, sent by Johnson’s top aide, Martin Reynolds, was troubling. “This garden party raises big questions for the Met police, as their officers must surely have monitored this gathering via their security cameras and been aware of the rules in place at the time,” she said. “The police are losing public trust with their attitude that there are lots of rules for us and no rules for Conservative ministers. Did Martin Reynolds consult with Met police officers about the Covid restrictions, or inform them of the event?”",News/UK news,Met police won’t investigate alleged No 10 lockdown party,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/13/met-police-wont-investigate-alleged-no-10-lockdown-party
1/14/2022,"Britain’s intelligence agencies have been gradually stepping up their warnings about their fears of Chinese espionage and influence peddling over the past couple of years – but until now there has not been such an public warning about a covert campaign in the UK. Thursday’s warning from MI5 that accused the lawyer Christine Lee of engaging “in political interference activities” on behalf of China’s ruling Communist party contrasts with its response when it concluded three spies were operating in the UK in 2020.  They had been posing as journalists, the agency concluded, and were quietly expelled – news of which only emerged in February 2021. Until now, MI5 has favoured caution when it comes to China. A warning from the agency last April that at least 10,000 Britons had been targeted by people using fake profiles, hoping to elicit information by posing on LinkedIn as online recruiters, was made so diplomatically that it did not even mention China at all. Yet sources at the agency privately admit Beijing is believed to be behind the activity. What has changed, in part, is a growing willingness by British intelligence to call out its concerns about China’s activities, against a backdrop of deteriorating government relations. It is just over six years since President Xi Jinping was invited to the UK on a state visit; even two years ago there was nervousness in official circles about criticising Beijing. The tone changed in November when Richard Moore, the head of the foreign intelligence agency MI6, declared China was the agency’s “single greatest priority” for the first time in its history. Like MI5, it believes that after reorganisations mandated by Xi, China has professionalised is espionage activities, developing, for example, a capacity for global surveillance. The warnings have had something of a theoretical quality about them. But this time MI5 used a rare device – a formal “interference alert” – to warn MPs and peers about its fears relating to Lee. Sent via the Speakers’ offices in both the House of Commons and Lords, parliamentarians received a pdf with information about Lee and her mugshot, with the agency’s own logo visible on the top left. It could have been more public only if the warning had been published on the MI5 website. MI5 won’t say how long it has been investigating Lee, although one source suggested it was about a year. Sources indicate that it has been deliberating about how to act for some weeks, and that the timing of the warning was of its choosing, unrelated to political difficulties faced elsewhere by Boris Johnson. Nevertheless, the agency will have not acted without informing Priti Patel, the home secretary, who is responsible for MI5, of what it believes it had discovered. A prominent Anglo-Chinese lawyer, Lee has been active and courting politicians for many years, making her first donation to a Labour MP in 2005, and making donations of £584,177.88 to the office of the Brent North MP Barry Gardiner (according to figures provided by Labour), largely in benefits in kind to help fund his researchers. Lee has also been pictured with David Cameron and the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, and has received an award from Theresa May. All this might have been discreetly prevented had MI5 been actively concerned about her activities at the time, but for whatever reason the intelligence agency has decided the time to act is now. Such episodes are likely to be repeated. For 20 years, since 9/11, Britain’s intelligence agencies have primarily been focused on tackling Islamist terrorism. But, stung by accusations that they took “their eye off the ball” when it came to the threat posed by Russia, MI5 and MI6 are keen to demonstrate they are on top of the evolving threats to British security – posed increasingly, they say, by determined nation states, not terrorists.",News/UK news,MI5 warning shows tone has changed when it comes to China,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/13/mi5-warning-christine-lee-tone-has-changed-china
1/14/2022,"The Republican party has signaled plans to withdraw from traditional US presidential debates, which it claims are biased against it. The New York Times first reported the move, citing a letter sent on Thursday by the Republican National Committee (RNC) to the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD).  The commission was set up in 1987, as a non-partisan body “to ensure, for the benefit of the American electorate, that general election debates between or among the leading candidates for the offices of president and vice-president … are a permanent part of the electoral process”. In the most recent election, in 2020, Donald Trump made headlines with an aggressive performance in the first debate, in Cleveland, Ohio. The second debate was cancelled after Trump was hospitalized with Covid-19 and the CPD sought to move the event online. Trump and Republicans protested that doing so would help Joe Biden. The final debate took place in Nashville, Tennessee as planned, with Biden widely adjudged the winner. A vice-presidential debate between Mike Pence and Kamala Harris also went ahead, in Salt Lake City. In December this year, the Guardian first revealed the stunning news that Trump tested positive for Covid before the first debate but concealed the result, potentially putting Biden’s life in danger. Trump said that was fake news. So did his former chief of staff Mark Meadows – who wrote the book which contained the bombshell. The Times said the Republican move against the CPD was born of longstanding complaints that it favors Democrats, “mirroring increasing rancor from conservatives toward Washington-based institutions”. Among Republican complaints in 2020 was that the first debate took place on 29 September, more than a month before election day but after nearly a million votes had been cast. Trump and Republicans also complained about supposed bias among debate moderators – even from Chris Wallace, then of the conservative Fox News network, in the first debate. Trump remains favorite to be the Republican nominee in 2024. The threatened withdrawal from CPD debates, the Times said, followed “months of discussions between the commission and party officials”. David Bossie, a longtime rightwing operative with strong links to Trump, was reported to be leading the RNC on the issue, seeking among other aims to insert political representatives in meetings of the CPD board. Withdrawal will have to be approved at the RNC’s winter meetings in Utah in February, the Times said. In her letter, according to the Times, the RNC chair, Ronna McDaniel, said: “So long as the CPD appears intent on stonewalling the meaningful reforms necessary to restore its credibility with the Republican party as a fair and nonpartisan actor, the RNC will take every step to ensure that future Republican presidential nominees are given that opportunity elsewhere.” In a statement, the CPD said it “deals directly with candidates for president and vice-president who qualify for participation”, and said “plans for 2024 will be based on fairness, neutrality and a firm commitment to help the American public learn about the candidates and the issues”.",News/US news,Republican party signals plans to withdraw from US presidential debates,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/13/republican-party-signals-plans-withdraw-presidential-debates
1/14/2022,"Sajid Javid has ordered the boss of the health service to give private hospitals up to £270m, even though they may not treat any NHS patients in return, despite her deep misgivings about the deal. The health secretary ignored strongly worded warnings from Amanda Pritchard and instructed her to hand private hospitals £75m to £90m a month from NHS England funds for the next three months, in case they are needed to help manage a new Omicron-driven surge in Covid cases. Operators of the facilities will receive the money as a “minimum income guarantee” simply for being on standby until the end of March to receive NHS patients, even if they treat none.  Pritchard also raised grave doubts about a deal under which her organisation would have to pay independent hospitals up to £525m if they did end up treating any NHS patients. The extraordinary clash has been revealed in an exchange of letters in which Pritchard, NHS England’s chief executive, laid bare her concerns about a new contract between NHS England and 10 private hospital groups, which was announced on Monday. At the time NHS England stressed that the arrangement had been “struck under the direction of the secretary of state” but gave no further details. In Pritchard’s letter to Javid, she said either deal would leave the health service “exposed financially” and involved “a material risk that the NHS pays for activity that is not performed”. Either scenario represented poor value for money for the NHS because private hospitals’ lack of staff meant they could not be relied upon to treat any NHS cases, even if asked to do so, she said. The disclosure prompted immediate criticism of Javid. Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrats’ health spokesperson, accused him of meddling by forcing Pritchard to agree to make payments about which she had significant reservations. “We trust the NHS to plan ahead. They are the experts, not Sajid Javid,” she said. “Interference in the day-to-day running of the NHS at worst leads to meddling and politicisation, and at best creates a bureaucratic nightmare, where no one knows who is in charge. “We must remember that the two areas Javid’s predecessor, Matt Hancock, had power over were PPE and test and trace, both of which were extremely badly handled.” Colin Hutchinson, a retired consultant ophthalmic surgeon who chairs the campaign group Doctors for the NHS, which opposes privatisation of NHS care, questioned whether the NHS was in effect helping private hospitals negotiate a downturn in business. He said: “Do they have the staff to do this or is this deal again bailing them out at a time when they can’t maintain their cashflow from their normal activities? “The independent sector in healthcare is acting as a parasite, absorbing public funding that could be used to address the workforce crisis within the NHS. It’s being portrayed as being the cavalry riding to the rescue of the NHS, but it is more like a tapeworm.” The letters show that, in an unusual move, Pritchard requested a “direction” from Javid – an order in effect – on whether or not to conclude a deal with the private sector, given her fear that it would prove a waste of valuable NHS funding and that she might be in breach of her legal duty, as NHS England’s accountable officer, to follow the Treasury’s rules on “managing public money”. In her letter, Pritchard told the health secretary: “The independent sector is not typically used for medical bed capacity and its staffing model does not easily support significant 7/7 staffed bed capacity. It is therefore not possible to be sure what additional effective medical bed capacity would be available,” should the NHS declare a Covid-19 surge and ask private hospitals to help by taking patients. While private hospitals had indicated that they could provide “around 5,600 physical beds in surge if required, it is estimated that approximately 2,000 to 3,000 of these beds could be staffed, but the independent sector providers cannot guarantee this to us”. It is understood that the private hospital groups involved, including Spire, Circle and Ramsay, felt they were due compensation for their facilities going on standby, as doing so could limit their ability to earn money by treating their usual fee-paying private clients. The £75m to £90m a month “minimum income guarantee” is intended to cover that. Sid Ryan, a researcher at the Centre for Health and the Public Interest, a thinktank that has challenged private hospitals being handed deals to help the NHS during the pandemic, said: “There are real concerns not just on value for money, but on the industry’s ability to deliver too, so it’s not clear why this deal is necessary, especially at this late stage in the Omicron wave. “The National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee must look into this deal urgently, and we expect the department [of health and social care] and NHSE to publish a full account of what the private providers actually deliver under this deal.” In Javid’s reply, he overrode Pritchard’s concerns and ordered her to conclude the deal. “I recognise the managing public money issues that these arrangements cause for you as the accounting officer,” he wrote. “However … I believe the need to protect NHS services and prevent a further reduction in NHS capacity are compelling reasons to justify their introduction.” A spokesperson for the Independent Healthcare Provider Network, which represents private hospitals, said: “In response to a call by the government for further independent sector support during the Omicron wave of Covid-19, the new deal agreed will provide much needed additional capacity to the NHS this winter and help to bolster planned NHS care, including the delivery of vital cancer treatment. “The arrangements also provide the NHS with additional targeted support in the event that local NHS pressures are deemed as unsustainable.”",News/Society,Javid tells NHS England to give private hospitals up to £270m in case of Omicron surge,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/13/sajid-javid-nhs-england-private-hospitals-omicron
1/14/2022,"The Operation Brock system installed to manage expected traffic chaos in Kent after Brexit will now itself cause a year of disruption as the barrier is moved from the edge to the middle of the motorway. The scheme, costing an initial estimated £35m, was designed to reduce blockages on the roads to and from the Channel ports with a contraflow system for queueing lorries held up by border and customs requirements.  Steel sections originally in use were replaced by a movable concrete barrier from 2020, meant to minimise disruption by reducing installation and deactivation times. Now that barrier itself needs moving, according to National Highways, on to the central reservation while it tackles drainage issues on the motorway. Work to move and store the barrier will see overnight closures of parts of the M20, which runs from London to Folkestone, starting at the end of January, with lanes closed on both sides for an expected 40 weeks. The concrete barriers run on a 16-mile stretch of the Kent motorway, and are currently stored on the London-bound hard shoulder. While queues never reached the worst-case predictions of up to 13,000 lorries, the system was briefly revived last July when the start of the school holidays raised fears of congestion around the Channel ports. Last October it was revealed that the government was retaining the emergency powers to implement the system in case of future border disruption. National Highways said it would need to carry out an extensive drainage upgrade and ground work to allow the Brock barrier to be stored on the central reservation. Work could last up to 12 months, it said. Confusingly, the Brock barrier will be placed on the motorway to seal off the necessary works until October. National Highways said this will “not mean the Brock contraflow system will be active” – but it could be. The measure “will provide a more efficient and cost-effective way of being able to deploy the contraflow quickly and effectively should it be required”, the agency added. Reduced speed limits will also be in place on parts of the M20 for the duration of the works. Councillors said they do not fully understand the reasons behind the latest developments in Operation Brock, whose deployment has long been a source of irritation for local people and motorists. Ashford borough council’s deputy leader, Paul Bartlett, told Kent Online he believed there were safety concerns, adding: “It seems extraordinary for it to take 12 months. They’ve sent a very long letter out about it but it doesn’t give a great deal of information about why they are doing it.”",News/Politics,Work on post-Brexit lorry contraflow system in Kent will disrupt M20 for a year,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/13/work-on-post-brexit-lorry-contraflow-system-in-kent-will-disrupt-m20-for-a-year
1/14/2022,"Kyrsten Sinema publicly and bluntly reaffirmed she would not support any change to the filibuster rules on Thursday, effectively killing her party’s hope of passing the most sweeping voting rights protections in a generation.  Sinema took to the Senate floor around noon on Thursday and said she would not support any changes to the filibuster, the Senate rule that requires 60 votes to advance legislation. “While I continue to support these [voting rights] bills, I will not support separate actions that worsen the underlying disease of division infecting our country,” said Sinema, a first-term Democrat from Arizona. “We must address the disease itself, the disease of division, to protect our democracy, and it cannot be achieved by one party alone. It cannot be achieved solely by the federal government. The response requires something greater and, yes, more difficult than what the Senate is discussing today.” Sinema’s speech comes at an extremely perilous moment for US democracy. Republican lawmakers in 19 states have enacted 34 new laws, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, that impose new voting restrictions. They have also passed a slew of bills that seek to inject more partisan control into election administration and the counting of votes, an unprecedented trend experts are deeply concerned about and call election subversion. Many of those measures have been passed in state legislatures on simple majority, party-line votes. For months, Sinema and fellow Democrat Joe Manchin have staunchly defended the filibuster, which stands as he major hurdle to voting rights reform. No Republicans support either the voting rights bills or changing the rules of the filibuster, so Democrats cannot do anything unless both senators are on board. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, has pledged a vote on the measure and rule changes by Monday, a public holiday to celebrate the civil rights leader Martin Luther King. The opposition is also a major blow to Joe Biden, who gave a speech in Atlanta on Tuesday calling on Democrats to support the bill. Sinema gave the speech about an hour before Biden traveled to the Capitol to meet Democrats to urge them to support rule changes. The White House said it did not have a comment in response to Sinema’s speech. Civil rights leaders quickly denounced Sinema after her speech on Thursday. “History will remember Senator Sinema unkindly. While she remains stubborn in her ‘optimism’, black and brown Americans are losing their right to vote,” said Martin Luther King III, the son of the civil rights leader. “She’s siding with the legacy of Bull Connor and George Wallace instead of the legacy of my father and all those who fought to make real our democracy.” “Arizonans value leaders who can compromise and work across the aisle, but let me be clear: the filibuster is non-negotiable. Indivisibles, like myself, worked tooth-and-nail to get Sinema elected in 2018 – we made calls, registered voters and knocked on doors in the 120F weather,” said Signa Oliver, an activist with the Arizona chapter of Indivisible, a grassroots group. “We know the weight of this trifecta, and we will not sit idly by as Sinema lets our hard work and the prospect of a better country for all wither so she can be branded a bipartisan leader.” Jared Huffman, a Democratic congressman from California, tweeted: “Shame on you.” Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, praised Sinema’s speech as an act of “political courage” that could “save the Senate as an institution”, according to the Associated Press. For months, Democrats have championed two bills, the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The former measure would overhaul federal election rules to set baseline requirements for voter access. It would require 15 days of early voting, as well as same-day and automatic registration. It also includes provisions that make it harder to remove election officials without justification, and would make it easier for voters to go to court to ensure their votes aren’t thrown out. The latter bill would require states where there is repeated evidence of recent voting discrimination to get changes approved by the federal government before they go into effect. It updates and restores a provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, that was struck down by the supreme court in 2013. The US House passed a mega-bill on Thursday morning that combined both of those measures into a single bill. It was a procedural move to allow the Senate to quickly hear and debate the measure.",News/US news,Sinema says no to filibuster reform and scuttles Democrats’ voting rights hopes,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/13/kyrsten-sinema-democrats-filibuster-voting-rights
