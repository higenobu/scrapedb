1/8/2022,"Iam sitting at the kitchen table. My wife is standing at the sink with her back to me, washing something up while telling me about all the upcoming social obligations she has managed to extract us from. “Is it a good idea,” I ask, “us never going anywhere again?”  “I don’t care,” she says. “I’ve forgotten how to socialise, and I don’t want to learn again.” “No, I mean, me neither,” I say. “It’s just, I don’t know.” “If you would like to be in charge of our social lives from now on, feel free,” she says. I remain silent for a minute, keeping open the possibility that I didn’t hear this bit. “What do you want to do for our 30th wedding anniversary?” I say. “Oh God,” my wife says, turning round. “How close is it?” “It’s the next one,” I say. “But still months,” she says. “Many months.” ‘’ “There’s probably still time to get divorced first, if that’s what you’re worried about.” I say this with the confidence of someone who thinks: there is nowhere near enough time to get divorced first. “I don’t want to do anything,” she says. “I know, but it’s 30 years,” I say. “It feels like the sort of thing where we should invite everyone we know to a remote island.” “And kill them?” she says. A brief silence follows. “Well, maybe,” I say. “But don’t put anything about that in the save-the-date email.” I didn’t intend to give my wife the opportunity to reconsider three decades of marriage; I only raised the subject in a bid to distract her from the idea of passing sole responsibility for our social calendar to me. She did the same thing with cooking about two years ago, and I have not coped well. The afternoon brings on an urge to take a long and solitary walk, but the sky turns black and rain comes down in billowing sheets. I lie on the sofa with a book on my chest. Thirty years is more than half my life, I think. I have been married for most of the time I’ve been alive. And in that time countless opportunities to be a better husband have been squandered. My eyes are just beginning to roll to the back of my head when my wife comes in and speaks some words. “What?” I say, the book sliding off my chest. “It’s garden waste,” she says. This is shorthand for a particular phase in the rotating collection cycle: the night of the three bins – black rubbish, food scraps, green garden waste wheelie. “Ugh,” I say. Half of our front garden is given over to a small paved drive (it was like that when we moved in), so it’s impossible to get the rubbish to the kerb without somebody – my wife – backing the car up a bit while somebody else – me – drags the bins from their normal resting place. I’ve had hundreds of chances to perform this office with something like grace over the years, and I’ve seized none of them. Rain runs into my collar as I pull the garden waste across the bricks in the glare of the car’s headlights. The wheels of the bin catch in some gravel, nearly turning it over. “Shitting hell,” I say. Behind the windscreen my wife’s face glows as she looks down at her phone. That night my family draw amusement from the shrivelled carrots I produce for supper. “They look like raisins,” says the middle one. “They were small to begin with,” I say, “but then I forgot about them in the oven.” I thought adding an unrehearsed vegetable dish to a standard Tuesday meal was within my capabilities, but it turned out to be akin to adding a fourth chainsaw to a juggling routine right before showtime. “The rice isn’t done,” the oldest one says. “I forgot about the rice,” I say. “Because of the carrots.” “Is this meat safe to eat?” the youngest one says. “I don’t recommend you eat any of it,” I say. Lying in bed later with the rain still hitting the roof, my mood lightens. It’s wrong to dwell on past opportunities for improvement missed, when there are still opportunities ahead: islands to be hired, guests to be invited, quicksand traps dug and covered with leaves.

1/8/2022,"Frostbitten faggots, a tub of mystery white sauce and a big lump of blue cheese sit on my counter defrosting: is this food still even edible, I ask myself, and if so, how should I cook it? I haven’t had time to check my freezer for a while, but when used properly, it’s an excellent food-waste-prevention tool, prolonging shelf life by months. You can freeze pretty much anything, to preserve nutrients as much as to prevent waste. Freeze food before its use-by date, and make sure it’s packed in airtight bags or freezer-proof containers to avoid freezer burn.  In case of any spillage and therefore cross-contamination, ideally keep meat and dairy in the bottom drawer, cooked food in the middle and fruit and fresh foods at the top. Inspect your freezer’s contents before going to the shops, not least because building them into your meals will both prevent them getting freezer burn and keep your weekly shopping bill down. Label items clearly, with a description and use-by date, to avoid freezer confusion. Most foods will freeze well for two to six months, after which their texture will probably deteriorate, though it’s often still usable for up to a year. Blend defrosted food into soups to avoid any unpleasant textures, while even freezer-burnt meat can be marinated, minced or stewed to help improve its mouthfeel. Defrost food in the fridge overnight, to avoid the so-called danger zone, because bacteria can form above 8C. Once defrosted, it’s a good general rule to eat it within 24 hours, and don’t refreeze unless it’s been cooked since thawing. The Food Standards Agency says: “It doesn’t matter if you cook your meat from frozen or fresh, you can use your leftovers to make a new meal. This new meal can then be frozen, but make sure you only reheat it once.” How to freezeFruit Love Food Hate Waste estimates that 81.25% of the fruit we waste is because we just haven’t used it in time. Raw or cooked fruit can be frozen whole or sliced for ease of use in smoothies or porridge, say (we even freeze brown bananas and our daughter’s half-eaten ones, peeled and sliced, in a tub). Foods that have a high water content, such as fruit, may turn mushy as they defrost, but they are still fine to blend or cook. Vegetables The National Center for Home Food Preservation in the US recommends blanching vegetables before freezing to prevent flavour, colour and texture loss; if you have time, prep and cut them, too, for ease of use (if need be, though, you can always freeze something whole to prevent it from going to waste). At home, we keep a freezer container for vegetable scraps to make stock, and if we have an excess of vegetables at the end of the week, we blanch and freeze them for later. Herbs These perish quickly, so catch them before they turn to mulch. Chop up, spread on a tray, freeze, then pack into a container so they don’t freeze in one solid block. Or pack into ice-cube trays, top up with water and freeze. Meat and fish The cost and resources that go into producing meat make it a product with a big foodprint. Even a small amount of frozen leftovers is a win-win, and can form the basis of a future thrifty meal, be it ragu, curry or pie. And remember, meat stores better in liquid, such as in a stew or curry, or double wrapped in a sealed bag to reduce the risk of freezer burn. Dairy The equivalent of 3.1m glasses of milk are wasted in the UK every day, yet only a quarter of the population freezes the stuff, compared with half who freeze meat, fish and bread. The government waste scheme Wrap estimates that just matching those levels for milk would cut more than 10,000 tonnes of waste, saving £5m. Freeze in a suitable container with space for the liquid to expand. (Milk can sometimes turn lumpy when it’s been frozen, in which case it’s best used in cooking.) Freeze cheese in portions or grated for ease of use. Other Freeze leftover wine for sauces. Freeze batches of pastry or bread dough (it defrosts really quickly and is much better than shop-bought). Batch-cook meals and freeze, ready to reheat and fake-away a takeaway. According to the food systems charity Feedback, UK households throw away 24m slices of bread a day, so freeze and pop straight into the toaster as required. Incidentally, in the end, I made a blue cheese fondue with my freezer scraps, while the faggots fed the compost monster.

1/8/2022,"It all started with a hooded tracksuit worth less than £30. The unwanted item, processed online at one second past midnight on Christmas Day because it was too large, was the first in a torrent of festive returns for ZigZag Global, a company that specialises in handling online returns. Within an hour, 709 products had been returned online via ZigZag; at 3.51am a £99 off-the-shoulder dress was the first item to be deposited at an InPost locker, and when newsagents began opening at 10am, queues began forming at counters to post back unwanted items.  Shoppers have sent back more goods than ever this Christmas as the cancellation of parties, the return to working from home and a shift to online shopping led to an enormous pile of unwanted goods. Since Christmas, returns have surged by 24% on the year before, according to ZigZag, which works with the likes of Boohoo, Selfridges and Gap. Fellow returns specialist ReBound has recorded even higher demand, with returns in December 40% greater than a year earlier. With up to half of clothing bought online returned to some retailers, the whole process is estimated to cost businesses about £7bn a year, according to a 2020 study by consultancy KPMG. It is tricky to measure the environmental costs, but the transport, storage and disposal of items that cannot be resold because they are damaged or dirty is likely to weigh heavily on brands’ carbon footprints, and poses troubling questions about the dark side of the online sales boom. Anita Balchandani at consultancy McKinsey says managing the flow of returned goods is a “sustainability imperative for the industry”, not just looking at the impact of the “last mile” delivery to, and from, homes – but also what happens to an item that is no longer wanted. While the percentage of items sent back by online shoppers dipped in the early days of the pandemic, it has since risen as trends have changed: easy-fitting tracksuits, popular during the start of working-from-home, have been ditched in favour of more structured items such as suits and dresses, thanks to the return of weddings and office working. Last month, online fast fashion specialist Boohoo was forced to slash sales and profit expectations, partly as a result of the change in habits. About 15% of electrical goods sent back after being bought online are disposed of, according to one major reprocessor, because either they are unfixable or not worth fixing or cleaning. Every brand or retailer has a different benchmark, but as it costs up to £20 to reprocess each individual item many returns lose retailers money. Many small products, unless still untouched in their original packaging, will never be reused. A considerable effort is involved in processing returns. Checking goods are in safe working condition, clean and that any software has been wiped of personal images or data, must be done manually and is a time consuming, sometimes tricky process. While some brands supply reprocessors with free parts to mend faulty items and avoid them being landfilled, others do not. A large expensive item, such a washing machine or even a food processor, is likely to be checked, fixed and resold – probably via an auction site such as eBay – for 15% or 20% less than its retail price. But the best that can be expected for most broken or used hair clippers or electric toothbrushes is that they are dismantled for recycling. Cosmetics are another tricky area. Unless they are completely untouched and in their original package, resale is not possible because of the hygiene risk. About 80% of returned clothing is likely to be resold without significant work – perhaps requiring new packaging or a steam. Of the rest, most can be reprocessed but about 5% is likely to be deemed unfit for resale, either because it is too damaged or potentially unhygienic – such as worn underwear or swimwear. Items that have clearly been on a night out, had tags removed or are marked with cosmetics may not easily be revamped for sale by the original retailer and, again, the value of that item will influence the decision over whether it is to be to put through a cleaning or mending process or ditched. Al Gerrie, the chief executive of ZigZag Global, says: “Fast fashion has about a six-week life cycle. If it spends three or four weeks off the shelf it is losing value in that time and, if it can’t make it back [in time], it will be less attractive or unsaleable. If it’s a Christmas-themed item, it may have to wait until next year.” Many unwanted items may be sold in bulk to charities or to resellers who then mend or repurpose them for sale on eBay or Depop. For the rest, the vast majority of major retailers now send those unwanted items to charities or for recycling, but a proportion is still thought to be either burned or sent to landfill despite a furore over such practice in recent years. However, pressure to behave more sustainably and to cut down costs is driving retailers to reduce the amount of unwanted goods. Laura Gee at another returns specialist ReBound, says: “Brands are on a learning curve. They are getting better at [reprocessing] as shoppers are becoming more sustainably minded.” Technology firms such as ZigZag and ReBound help retailers track returned items more closely, monitoring why a sale has not been successful and taking decisions on where and how to reprocess goods without necessarily bringing them all back to the UK, if sold overseas. Last year, eBay said it had seen a surge in retailers setting up their own online stores to clear unwanted products and seconds. Other techniques to reduce returns rates include posting customer reviews which flag how a garment fits, using avatars to enable virtual trying on of a dress or encouraging customers to bring an item back to a store where they can pick up, and try on, the alternative. Geerie at ZigZag says: “Even fast-fashion retailers are becoming more conscious about corporate social responsibility and being more sustainable and trying to recover product whenever possible. It is a shift in the market for the good but not at a low cost, they are definitely losing money on some products.” Change is partly being driven by the threat of legislation. In France, companies must monitor what happens to unsold goods and from this month are banned from destroying them. Other European countries are expected to follow suit. In the UK, charities called for an anti-waste law, to be introduced after Amazon was forced to deny it sent household goods such as laptops and TVs to landfill after employees were filmed by ITV last year placing such products into boxes labelled “destroy”. The company said the items were donated or recycled. Balchandani says better consumer education about the effects of buying more selectively will be key to reducing the wasteful merry-go-round of returned goods. “In a world where consumers are increasingly conscious of their carbon footprint I don’t think brands are doing enough talking about how do you consume more thoughtfully,” she says.",Lifestyle/Money,UK surge in post-Christmas returns reveals dark side of online shopping boom,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/08/uk-surge-in-post-christmas-returns-reveals-dark-side-of-online-shopping-boom

1/8/2022,"Hunter Lewis left his father’s home on California’s far northern coast last week with a plan. The adventurous college student, 21, had spent years creating an elaborate treasure hunt for his friends and family. Now it was time to hide the final prize. On 30 December, Lewis is believed to have launched a 15ft green canoe into the frigid Pacific waters to hide the treasure that would complete the journey.  He never returned home. Lewis’s adventure had been years in the making. An experienced outdoorsman who was scuba certified and had a second-degree black belt in Taekwondo, Lewis had always been fearless, his father, Corey Lewis, said. The boy grew up outdoors, strapped to his father’s back as a one-year-old while the elder Lewis went snowshoeing in the Sierra Nevada. The Lewises loved movies involving lost treasure, such as National Treasure and the Goonies. And, over the course of the pandemic, while studying aerospace engineering and earning his pilot’s license, Lewis designed his own epic treasure hunt: the search for the “lost Lewis treasure”. Whenever he was back home visiting from California State University, Long Beach, he sketched maps and created riddles. The days before his disappearance had been joyful. Lewis spent the holidays with family, and then the treasure hunt commenced. The searches took participants all over Humboldt county, rappelling down a cliff, climbing a railroad trestle and hiking secret trails. Dozens of people participated in the adventure, which had elaborate clues, involving code and, in one case, Braille. “I’ve seen more secret beaches and coastlines and trails in the last few days than in the last decade,” Corey Lewis said of the hunt. “He was just wanting to give us all an adventure and an experience. He wanted everyone to experience those adventures.” Lewis wanted everyone to join. He spent three hours teaching a friend who was afraid of heights how to rappel, so that he could search for the treasure, Corey Lewis said. “We would stay up late at night poring over maps and riddles trying to solve ciphers. We’d get up early in the morning. We’d celebrate when we saw pictures and videos of someone finding a clue. It was wonderful,” Corey Lewis said. “He would show up and hang out with you for an hour or two as you kept searching and then celebrate with you when you found it.” On the last Thursday of December, Lewis set off to prepare the final part of the quest. He launched his canoe at Trinidad state beach. When he didn’t come home, the US Coast Guard began an overnight search. In past days, pieces of the canoe and other items Lewis had with him that day have begun washing ashore. Lewis’s family and friends refocused their search, no longer looking for a hidden treasure, but their loved one’s body. Joined by hundreds of others, they have scoured local beaches and caves by foot and on horseback and with boats, ATVs and planes. Lewis’s family believes he never made it out of the water. “We know it is not a rescue operation. It is a recovery of the lost Lewis treasure: my son Hunter’s body,” his father, Corey Lewis said. The coast guard suspended its search last week after canvassing 1,000 sq nautical miles, citing difficult conditions and exhaustive efforts. “It’s always difficult to suspend a search when you don’t have any answers as to what happened. In this case, with no further information to go on and given the conditions, we’ve exhausted our reasonable search options. We can only hope that additional information is found in the future that helps reveal what happened to this young man,” said Captain Mark Hiigel, the sector Humboldt Bay commander, in a statement. Using the treasure hunt he designed for them, Lewis’s loved ones believe they know what happened. Corey Lewis and his son’s fiancee, Kinsley Rolph, solved the last clue in the treasure hunt on Saturday with a heart-shaped key Lewis had created on his 3D printer. The grooves of the key match the pattern of sea stacks off the beach where Lewis was last seen, and the heart points to Flatiron Rock, a small island just offshore. Corey Lewis suspects his son, unaware of a hidden dangerous reef along one side of the island, capsized while approaching Flatiron Rock. Volunteers have recovered pieces of a large bucket, which Lewis was using to hide the treasure, from the shore, along with a small wooden cigar box. Lewis had the box since he was a kid when his father set up a treasure hunt for him and his younger brother. “It’s both just epically heroic and tragic,” Corey Lewis said. “Here we are involved in this epic treasure hunt, which started out with a letter which says ‘you are inheritors of the lost Lewis treasure. Part of the Lewis family years ago went down at sea and that treasure is hidden but you can find it’. Tragically that’s what happened. We’re searching for the lost Lewis treasure, and that’s him.”",News/US news,‘Epically heroic and tragic’: how a family treasure hunt ended with a son lost at sea,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/07/hunter-lewis-treasure-hunt-california
1/8/2022,"Boris Johnson’s ethics adviser has been accused of failing to investigate a potential “funds for favours” scandal after the prime minister was cleared of rule-breaking over his Downing Street flat refurbishment. Christopher Geidt shut his investigation without commenting on Johnson seeking funds for the works from a Conservative donor while promising to consider plans for a “great exhibition”. Expectations also faded that another inquiry, led by parliament’s standards commissioner Kathryn Stone, would go ahead.  However, it emerged that the UK’s data watchdog has launched an investigation into the Cabinet Office after a complaint that it failed to release WhatsApp messages exchanged between Boris Johnson and the Tory peer who financed his flat renovation, David Brownlow. Pressure on Lord Geidt to reopen his investigation mounted on Friday night when Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said his decision to close the case “raises a number of serious concerns and questions”. She claimed the original finding that Lord Brownlow had “altruistic and philanthropic motives” for paying for the flat refurbishment, and that there was “no reasonably perceived conflict”, appeared undermined by the WhatsApp messages. The existence of the messages emerged as part of a probe by the Electoral Commission that concluded in December but their contents were only published on Thursday. They showed Johnson told Brownlow parts of his No 11 flat were a “tip” and he was keen for his decor designer to “get on with it”, asking if he could put her in touch “for approvals”. The prime minister added: “PS am on the great exhibition plan Will revert.” In his reply, Brownlow said he would “get it sorted” and “approval is a doddle as it’s only me and I know where the £ will come from”, adding: “Thanks for thinking about GE2.” The great exhibition plan was backed by Brownlow, who several weeks later met to discuss it with the then culture secretary, Oliver Dowden. On Friday, Johnson’s spokesperson confirmed that No 10 passed on an inquiry about the suggested event to Dowden’s department. Johnson was forced to offer a “humble and sincere apology” for not recalling the messages, and blamed “security issues” – thought to relate to when his personal phone number was posted online – for not having access to the phone they were on. Rayner said it was “irrelevant” whether Brownlow’s motives were altruistic, and added: “The issue is that a reasonable person could surely perceive that his financial relationship with the prime minister has provided him with privileged access to government, and that relationship was undeclared at the time.” Rayner accused Geidt of holding Johnson to a “far weaker” standard for potential conflict of interests than that set out in the MPs’ code of conduct, adding: “This suggests that you will hold ministers to a lower standard of transparency than backbench MPs.” She called on Geidt to publish a new or amended report, but senior Whitehall sources downplayed such a possibility. “It’s probably not going to get anywhere,” said one. “I’m sure Lord Geidt will issue a polite reply.” While Stone was waiting for the Electoral Commission and Geidt’s inquiry to conclude before proceeding, the standards commissioner was said to be unlikely to launch an investigation of her own. This is because Johnson’s flat was used by him in a ministerial capacity, meaning any potential wrongdoing would need to be judged against the ministerial code. Rayner called on 9 December for Stone to launch an investigation into whether Johnson broke the rule that MPs have to be honest, given the non-disclosure of the texts with Brownlow. However, even if Stone dismisses it, Labour could make a separate complaint based on the new evidence that emerged this week. The MPs’ code of conduct makes clear that ministers are bound by the ministerial code, which is not enforced by the standards commissioner. But it adds allegations about “failure to abide by the rules on lobbying for reward or consideration” are within Stone’s scope. In further criticism of Geidt’s inquiry, Labour’s lawyers wrote to him on 4 January after stories appeared in the press suggesting Johnson would be cleared of breaching the ministerial code. The solicitors’ firm Edwards Duthie Shamash said the “apparent failure” of Geidt’s investigation to obtain the WhatsApp messages was “more than unfortunate”. Geidt was accused in the letter of “failure to ask the searching questions necessary to get to the truth of this matter and that such failures should not allow the prime minister to escape the consequences of apparent breaches of the ministerial code”. The lawyers added: “The recent briefings have done little to restore my client’s faith in the processes over which you preside.” Geidt did not respond, but his office said in reply to another letter sent several weeks previously that it “is not generally appropriate” for him to “engage in legal correspondence in respect of the discharge of his functions”. Separately, the Cabinet Office is being investigated after it was asked in a Freedom of Information request for all correspondence between Johnson and Brownlow but claimed there was nothing to hand over. The data watchdog, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), received a letter from Rayner in December raising “concerns” because the Electoral Commission report had unearthed texts exchanged between Johnson and Brownlow. “We are now conducting inquiries about the handling of this request,” a senior official at the ICO confirmed in response, saying it was a “live case”. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, defended Geidt, saying he was “very well respected and has a very fiercely independent role”. Downing Street said Brownlow was given no special treatment. “Ministers have a range of ideas and proposals put to them by various people – through MPs, through other parties,” Johnson’s spokesperson said.",News/Politics, ‘Funds for favours’: Geidt pressed to reopen investigation into PM’s flat,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/08/alexander-geidt-investigation-boris-johnson-flat
1/8/2022,"The US has been battered by extreme weather in recent weeks. Heavy snowfall swept the west coast, with Seattle recording an unseasonable 9in of snow. On 2 January, Washington was struck by “thundersnow” storms that left five dead and 850,000 homes without power. And, conversely, extreme heat was recorded in southern states, with temperatures soaring to the mid-30s Celsius. The former tropical cyclone Seth made landfall on the north-east coast of Australia this week, bringing gale-force winds of about 65mph and waves rising to 9 metres. The gusts, which coincided with high tides, caused hazardous conditions on 3 and 4 January in south-east Queensland, putting a strain on coastguards on the Gold Coast.  In Malaysia, 50 people were killed and 125,000 evacuated from their homes in the past two weeks after extreme flooding. While floods are not unusual during the monsoon season, the region was hit by one month’s average rainfall in one day, leading to one of the worst incidents of flash flooding on record. The government has promised to provide $300m in aid, and requested an additional $3m from the UN’s Green Climate Fund to help adapt to an uncertain future.",News/News,Thundersnow and record rain bring extreme weather to parts of world,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/jan/08/thundersnow-rain-extreme-weather-us-australia-and-malaysia
1/8/2022,"North of Tywyn, a 19th-century land reclamation dyke heads from the Wales coastal path to the Ynysymaengwyn estate. At wintry dawn through a glass, I watched passing squadrons of dark, goose-sized birds, necks outstretched, wings beating powerfully before they glided down into Morlyn – a square kilometre of coastal lagoon formerly known as Broadwater. The birds were cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo). Their rookery – the only inland breeding colony in Wales – is four miles upriver on a former sea cliff, Craig yr Aderyn, where their presence was first recorded in 1695 by the Welsh naturalist Edward Lhuyd. (An early Welsh poem suggests that they were already long established at that date.) These prehistoric-seeming birds splashed down, sat low in the water with heads upraised, then dived with the serpentine spasm that earns them their Welsh name of Bilidowcar (Billy the ducker) to seek out flatfish and eels. After they’d caught and swallowed their awkward prey, they emerged from a channel through Morlyn to waddle on to sandbanks in the twisting course of the river. There they stood in habitual pose, wings outstretched. (Their wings lack weatherproofing, to decrease buoyancy in diving – a marvellous evolutionary touch – so must be dried before flight.)  Until recent times, Welsh angling associations offered bounties for the heads of cormorants. Now even the wildfowling fraternity around Broadwater SSSI has its activities constrained, mainly thanks to diligent work by Marged Tudor-Turner in pressing the Ordnance Survey to resurvey tidal limits along the Afon Dysynni. Her work with oceanographers from Bangor University has established that the lagoon “predominantly fluctuates in response to river inputs, rather than tidal exchange”. This has been of crucial importance here, for crown estate leases of shooting rights are dependent on foreshore classification: if the banks are riparian, they’re not crown estate and can’t be leased by that body to the shooters. The Unesco Dyfi biosphere (of which Morlyn should be a part) is a haven for lapwings and curlews – both declining species, here being one of their last strongholds. Marged and her fellow conservationists have won a famous victory for wildlife. Let’s hope the threat of species loss prevails against this bloody “sport”.
