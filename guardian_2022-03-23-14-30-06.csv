3/23/2022,"Almost 100,000 people remain trapped in the ruined city of Mariupol, facing starvation amid “constant” Russian bombardment, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said, as he appealed for the release of a convoy he said had been captured by Russian forces. In a video address late on Tuesday, he renewed his calls for Russia to allow safe humanitarian corridors, and said civilians faced “inhumane conditions. In a total siege. Without food, water, medication, under constant shelling and under constant bombing.” More than 7,000 people had escaped the city in the past 24 hours, he said. However one humanitarian convoy travelling on an agreed route west of the city had been “captured by the occupiers”. The convoy near Mangush consisted of bus drivers and emergency service personnel. “We are doing everything we can to free out people and unblock the movement of humanitarian aid.” he said. Tens of thousands of residents have already fled the besieged southern port city, bringing harrowing testimony of a “freezing hellscape riddled with dead bodies and destroyed buildings”, according to Human Rights Watch. Satellite images of Mariupol released by Maxar WHEN showed a charred landscape, with several buildings ablaze and smoke billowing from the city. The Pentagon has said Russia was now pummelling Mariupol using artillery, long-range missiles and naval ships deployed in the nearby Sea of Azov. “They bombed us for the past 20 days,” said 39-year-old Viktoria Totsen, who fled into Poland. “During the last five days, the planes were flying over us every five seconds and dropped bombs everywhere on residential buildings, kindergartens, art schools, everywhere.” “It is clear that the occupiers are not interested in the city of Mariupol, they want to raze it to the ground, to reduce it to ashes of a dead land,” one local official said. Amid the bloodshed, Zelenskiy held out hope for negotiations, which have yielded little since the invasion began on 24 February. “It’s very difficult, sometimes confrontational,” he said. “But step by step we are moving forward.” For the first time, there are signs that Ukrainian forces are going on the offensive, retaking a town near Kyiv and launching counter attacks in the south of the country, amid claims that Russian forces have just a few days of supplies remaining. In the face of intense Ukrainian resistance, the Pentagon believes Russia’s forces may have been reduced by as much as 10% in the four weeks of fighting since the invasion began. “The Russians may be slightly below a 90% level of assessed available combat power,” a senior defence official told reporters in Washington, adding that some Russian forces were suffering from frostbite. The US president, Joe Biden, is due to travel to Brussels this week for Nato and G7 talks to discuss further action against Russia, including tighter sanctions. Biden discussed Moscow’s “brutal” tactics in a call with European leaders on Monday. Biden will then head to Poland, which has received the bulk of more than 3.5 million Ukrainians fleeing war in their country. Zelenskiy will speak virtually at the Nato summit in Brussels on Thursday. Amid concerns that Vladimir Putin, who Biden believes has “his back against the wall”, is considering the use of chemical and biological weapons, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov spoke to CNN about the circumstances in which Russia would use nuclear weapons. Speaking to Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday, Peskov repeatedly refused to rule out that Russia would consider using nuclear weapons against what Moscow saw as an “existential threat.” US Department of Defence spokesman John Kirby said Moscow’s nuclear remarks were “dangerous” and were “not the way a responsible nuclear power should act”. However, Kirby added that Pentagon officials “haven’t seen anything that would lead us to conclude that we need to change our strategic deterrent posture”. Peskov also insisted that the military operation was going “strictly in accordance with the plans and purposes that were established beforehand.” In other developments: Russian forces “looted and destroyed” a laboratory at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Ukrainian officials said. “Russian occupiers illegally seized the newest laboratory,” Ukrainian authorities said in a statement late on Tuesday. The laboratory processes radioactive waste and contains “highly active samples” which are now in the hands of Russian forces, the agency added. The deputy head of Kyiv’s police force accused Russia of using white phosphorous munitions in the city of Kramatorsk in Donetsk. Oleksiy Biloshytskiy shared online footage, which could not be independently verified, of material burning fiercely underneath a pile of aggregate. “Another use of phosphorus ammunitions in Kramatorsk,” he said. The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, has said it is time for Russia to end its “absurd” and “unwinnable” war in Ukraine, as the EU prepared to set up a “trust fund” aimed at helping Kyiv repel the invasion and rebuild afterwards. “Even if Mariupol falls, Ukraine cannot be conquered city by city, street by street, house by house,” Guterres said. Russia plans to unleash a “great terror” on Kherson by kidnapping residents and taking them across the Russian border, an FSB whistleblower has claimed. The Kremlin was no longer willing to “play nicely” with protesters in the Ukrainian city, a letter said. About 300,000 people in the occupied southern city of Kherson are running out of food and medical supplies, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry said. Russian forces have “kidnapped” 2,389 children from the Russian-controlled areas of Luhansk and Donetsk, the US embassy in Kyiv has said, citing figures by Ukraine’s foreign ministry. The embassy said: “This is not assistance. It is kidnapping.” With Agence France-Presse",News/World news,"100,000 civilians trapped in Mariupol amid Russia’s ‘constant bombing’, says Zelenskiy",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/ukraine-100000-civilians-trapped-in-mariupol-amid-russias-constant-bombing-says-zelenskiy
3/23/2022,"When Amanda Liu Chang and Jia Shihan grow old, they can tell their family members of the time they got married in the middle of a pandemic, Liu having to trudge with her wedding dress through the snow. The story began on 19 March when the couple awoke in their respective Tangshan city apartments in China’s Hebei province, looking forward to formalising their three-year romance with family and friends. But unknown to them, authorities had locked down Jia’s gated neighbourhood overnight, banning all residents from leaving, after some had tested positive for Covid-19. In keeping with custom, Jia had planned to pick up his fiance from her home at 6am. “When I tried to go outside our neighbourhood, our guard said we can’t go out at this time, that we’re isolated,” Jia told the Guardian. He phoned Liu with the bad news. “At that second I knew our wedding and everything could not be held. So I decided if he cannot get out I will come for him,” Liu says. She gathered her dress, shoes, makeup and other belongings. In a thick red coat, white sneakers and laden with bags, Liu jogged the three blocks to his community. It had snowed overnight, and temperatures had dropped to -6C. But when she arrived the guards were confused. Lockdowns were coming suddenly, amid China’s worst outbreak of the pandemic, and the guards didn’t seem to know the rules of this one. Eventually they told Liu she could come in but then she wouldn’t be allowed out again until the lockdown lifted. “Of course I wanted to come in. The guard unlocked the door and let me in, and I ran into Jia’s arms,” she said. The couple decided to push on with their plan to get married. A neighbour helped Liu with her hair and makeup, but halfway through they were ordered to get a PCR test. They complied, finished getting ready and the couple held a small ceremony inside Jia’s apartment. A neighbouring aunt acted as officiant, while Jia’s parents – who had been staying with him – looked on as witnesses. “My mum and family were in my home because they didn’t know the policy if they go outside,” says Liu. “It’s OK … My mum likes him, she thinks he is a very good son-in-law.” The couple were napping after the festivities when a relative’s classmate uploaded a video of the day to social media. By the time they woke up they were famous, with hundreds of millions of views and Chinese netizens praising the couple for finding a way through the restrictions to go ahead with their wedding. As attention built, they filmed themselves answering questions from viewers. “How does this affect our future life?” Jia read from one. “Going viral is just a short-term thing. We still have to go back to our normal life,” Liu answered. The couple are still locked in the compound. Many of Jia’s family members also live there, and so they’ve been helping to care for Jia’s nine-year-old nephew. They open one wedding gift a day, to keep themselves entertained, and are still fielding interview requests. To keep busy they play Uno and plan future trips. Jia spent four years studying in England and Scotland, and hopes to go back with his wife one day, when they are allowed to travel internationally again. Liu says she has two messages for people. “Stay home and do what you should do to help our world become normal quickly. The second thing is, you should go for your love.” Additional reporting by Xiaoqian Zhu",News/World news,"A run through the snow, PCR tests and no guests: a wedding in China’s Covid lockdown",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/a-run-through-the-snow-pcr-tests-and-no-guests-a-wedding-in-chinas-covid-lockdown
3/23/2022,"Marina Valentini is still bewildered as she surveys the scene of the crime, pointing to the floor of her bakery in Roccaraso, a small mountain town and ski resort in Italy’s Abruzzo region, where the crumbs of her freshly made biscuits were scattered. “My husband had popped to the bakery,” she said. “I was at home, expecting him for dinner, when he called and said: ‘Marina, there’s a bear in the bakery’. My first response was: ‘Have you been drinking?’” Valentini’s husband was very much sober. It was about 9pm in late November when a rare brown bear, fondly nicknamed Juan Carrito, sauntered up the town’s main street and crossed the terrace of Dolci Momenti (Sweet Moments) bakery, before turning into a side alley, smashing a small window with its claws and clambering over a ledge into the kitchen, where he scoffed a batch of biscuits. “He must have smelled them wafting down the street,” Valentini said. “I had baked so many, some were on the table, the rest were in the oven … the doors were slightly open and he managed to pull out all the trays and eat the biscuits.” It wasn’t the first time Carrito had brazenly ventured into Roccaraso. The two-year-old Marsican – a critically endangered subspecies of the brown bear living in the Apennine mountains that straddle the Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise regions – was practically a resident, as well as a star attraction for tourists, until his recent controversial capture. He would often stay overnight, sleeping among pine trees at the entrance to the town of about 1,500 inhabitants, before going in search of food, rummaging through bins and dining off leftover pizza and sandwiches. On one occasion he was spotted drinking from a fountain and, as skiers flocked to the town this winter, Carrito became increasingly bold, once standing on his hind legs as the curious visitors took photos. Valentini said the bear would often hang around outside the bakery, but he took the biscuit with the break-in. A few days after the break-in, forest rangers tranquillised the bear, flying it by helicopter to a remote area of wilderness in Majella national park. That, however, did not keep him away – Carrito, who is fitted with a radio collar, was soon back in Roccaraso, where he was filmed in the snow shrugging off a dog biting and barking around him. It was his growing, albeit unusual, affinity towards dogs that led rangers to take more drastic action, and in early March, Carrito was lured by apples into a “tube trap” – a device commonly used to capture bears – tranquillised and taken to an animal reserve 20km away in Palena, where he is monitored while being prepared to re-enter the wild. His capture has pitted residents in Roccaraso – with some saying he should be left to roam free – against authorities, who said it was necessary to remove him to prevent him causing harm, and for his own wellbeing. “Bears are often seen in inhabited areas but Carrito was becoming problematic, he was completely linked to the urban life of the town,” said Luciano Di Martino, a biologist and director of Majella national park. “We’ve seen him eating from bins, also eating plastic. His time at Palena will be temporary as we try to adapt him to his natural environment.” The Marsican bear population across the area has dwindled to an estimated 65 over the past two decades, thought to be the result of illegal hunting or the animals being hit by vehicles. Some bears have died after unwittingly eating poison laid down by truffle hunters intended for their rivals’ dogs. The bears are not known to be aggressive, but authorities are erring on the side of caution. “They do have long claws and teeth that are bigger than those of a wolf,” said Antonio Antonucci, a wildlife biologist at Majella national park. Bears that gravitate towards towns tend to be females with cubs, or young bears, although experts struggle to explain their motives, as there is an abundance of nutritious food in their natural environment. One explanation for Carrito’s sociability is his upbringing: he was one of four cubs born to a bear called Amarena. Such was the rarity of the event – on average, female Marsicans give birth to between one and three cubs – that the family attracted much attention. One of the first villages Amarena and her cubs appeared in was Carrito, hence the nickname. “Amarena became a phenomenon and was confident,” said Antonucci. “She raised them near a town, and so Carrito practically grew up among people, but this wasn’t good for him.” Human contact is ruled out at the enclosure in Palena, although Carrito is accompanied by three other bears, one a female rescued after 20 years in a cement cage as a visitor attraction run by the mafia. Food – a variety of fruit or deer meat – is given to him through a tube. “He can’t go near the other bears but he can see and smell them – the idea is for Carrito to be familiarised with his own species rather than dogs, and for him to adapt to his natural food,” Antonucci said. The bear’s stay at Palena is expected to last another couple of weeks before he is returned to the wild, although Antonucci is sceptical he will stay there. Back in Roccaraso, Valentini is prepared: the window through which Carrito entered the bakery has now been fitted with bars. “It was a disaster at the time, we had to throw everything away and disinfect everything,” she said. “Now I have to deal with the crazy publicity: tourists come in and ask: ‘are these the biscuits the bear ate’?”",News/World news,Italian bear removed to sanctuary after bakery break-in takes the biscuit,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/italian-bear-removed-to-sanctuary-after-bakery-break-in-takes-the-biscuit
3/23/2022,"The New South Wales government will move to suspend, rather than expel, embattled MP Gareth Ward from parliament while he awaits trial, after he was charged over allegations of sexual abuse against a man and a 17-year-old boy, following advice from the crown solicitor. Ward, the member for Kiama, denied the allegations and said he will be fighting the charges, but did not indicate if he planned to leave parliament while he did so. On Wednesday the NSW deputy premier, Paul Toole, confirmed the Coalition would not move to force Ward, a former minister, out of the state’s parliament, despite the premier yesterday saying he would “move a motion to remove” the Kiama MP if he refused to quit. Premier Dominic Perrottet said on Tuesday that Ward was entitled to the presumption of innocence, but that “the standards expected of an elected member of parliament are not compatible with the seriousness of the charges he is facing”. Instead, after advice from the crown solicitor, Toole told parliament the government would move to suspend Ward from parliament until a verdict is reached in a criminal trial against the MP. The decision, he said, was taken to “ensure alleged victims in this matter have their day in court”, he told the parliament. Toole, who is the state’s acting premier while Perrottet is on parental leave, tabled a motion stating that in “the interests of alleged victims … having their complaints considered by the criminal justice system” and the “fairness of criminal trials”, the government would move a motion to suspend Ward on Thursday. According to the motion, the suspension would last “until the verdict of the jury has been returned on the five criminal charges laid against him yesterday”. The decision means Ward will probably continue receiving his $169,000 annual salary as he faces criminal charges for alleged sexual abuse against a man and 17-year-old boy. In the motion, Toole conceded the parliament “does not have the power to withhold a member’s remuneration” but said the government “has sought advice on options” to “affect the withholding” of his “remuneration and all other entitlements”. The decision comes after Perrottet on Tuesday released a statement saying he would seek to remove Ward from parliament after police charged him with three counts of assault with acts of indecency, and one count each of common assault and sexual intercourse without consent. “Should Mr Ward not resign, the government will move a motion to remove him from the parliament,” Perrottet said. But the government says it has been unable to reach Ward since the charges were laid, and amid uncertainty about its legal power to expel him parliament the Coalition began walking back expectations it would expel the Kiama MP. Earlier on Wednesday finance minister Damien Tudehope said the government was considering two standing orders – one that would see Ward suspended and another expelled – but insisted the premier had not suggested he would seek to expel the MP. “[Perrottet] used the words excluded from the house – he did not use the word expelled,” Tudehope said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The premier has made it clear about his attitude towards the member remaining in the house, has asked him to resign from the house. In circumstances where he doesn’t resign, then there are appropriate processes that need to be gone down and explored.” The charges against Ward relate to two alleged incidents involving a 27-year-old man and 17-year-old boy. The charges laid on Tuesday came more than 10 months after Ward stepped aside as a minister and moved to the crossbench after revealing he was the subject of the police investigation. Opposition deputy leader Prue Car was asked on Wednesday what the threshold was for Labor to support an expulsion motion for a member – which it has done for Ward. “Everyone obviously is entitled to a presumption of innocence but we’re talking about a higher standard that members of parliament have to be held to,” she said. “Any reasonable person would think that does not pass a test that should be applied to members of parliament.” She called on the premier to explain when Ward would be removed. “Dominic Perrottet has to act swiftly as he promised to do to remove Gareth Ward from parliament.” In a Tuesday statement, Ward said he was “completely innocent” of the allegations and said he was looking forward to proving his innocence in court. He has been granted conditional bail and will appear before Port Kembla local court in May.",News/Australia news,"NSW government will move to suspend, not expel, MP Gareth Ward from parliament",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/23/nsw-government-will-move-to-suspend-not-expel-mp-gareth-ward-from-parliament
3/23/2022,"Flown out on one of the last flights to leave Kyiv before Russia invaded, the Ukrainians take in the scene. To their left lies the Mediterranean, to their right a palm tree-fringed five-star hotel. “We all work for a multinational IT firm which has an office in Cyprus,” says Xenia Karpenko, who since late February has been in the seaside resort of Limassol. “Less than 48 hours before the Russian invasion it said: ‘We’ll fly you out, with your family, your partners, your pets.’ There were 200 of us onboard. Now we have no idea what tomorrow will bring.” It may seem an unusual place for them to be. Until Cyprus began clearing up its act, it was better known as a refuge for high net worth Russians, many hiding ill-gotten gains. At least five Russian oligarchs with links to the eastern Mediterranean island are on EU sanctions lists. And no Cypriot city has lured Russians more zealously than Limassol. With its 40,000-strong Russian community, Russian banks, Russian media outlets and privately run Russian schools, it is easy to see why the waterfront metropolis is also known as Limassolgrad. On boulevards lined with billboards emblazoned with Cyrillic script, it is Russian that is frequently heard. Russians account for the vast majority who have also invested in multimillion-euro homes – often in high-rise apartment blocks changing the city’s skyline – to attain citizenship under a now scrapped cash-for-passports scheme reputed to have raised more than €9bn (£7.6bn) for the island. It also has its own Russian political party. “We love it here,” says Valentina Ivanova, who was out strolling with her sausage dog. “It’s hard to miss Moscow in the sun but to be honest we understand our president. The west pushed Russia too hard. Putin didn’t have a choice with Ukraine; he had to go in.” Although Cyprus has a growing Ukrainian community (estimated at about 4,000), it is not lost on those now forced to flee that they have ended up in one of Europe’s most pro-Russian milieus. Almost alone among EU capitals, Nicosia has borne witness to both protests in support of Vladimir Putin’s “special military operation” as well as fiery anti-war rallies. Tensions have erupted between Ukrainian and Russian youngsters in schools and university lecture halls. But the bloc’s most easterly member is keen to emphasise it has thrown its weight behind the west. The tiny state has taken in more than 3,000 displaced Ukrainians to date. Last week it delivered what was described as its biggest-ever humanitarian aid package to the war-torn nation. To punish Moscow for its military actions, the non-Nato member has also banned Russian naval ships from mooring in Cypriot ports to refuel and restock, the island’s foreign minister has said. “There is a war going on. We are not going to be seen to be aiding and abetting it,” said Ioannis Kasoulidis, noting that Cyprus, like fellow-Orthodox Greece and the rest of the EU, has been placed by Russia on an “unfriendly countries” list. “We used to be exposed to money laundering but now we’re good boys. The shell companies, the ‘golden passport’ stories are over. All possible loopholes have been closed … and we’re doing everything we can not to allow anyone to say we’re not observing EU sanctions.” Despite initial reluctance, Nicosia also agreed to exclude Russian banks from accessing the Swift international payment system. The move is seen as particularly significant because of the island’s role as one of Russia’s biggest foreign investors, the result of Russian-owned offshore companies reinvesting in the country. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, was quick to hail the decision a diplomatic victory. For Ruslan Nimchynskyi, Kyiv’s ambassador to Cyprus, there is no doubt whose side Nicosia is on. Although sleep-deprived and exhausted – “diplomacy like the army are working 24/7” – the envoy is animated by what he sees as an outpouring of solidarity towards Ukraine. In addition to official expressions of support, there are smaller gestures, such as the flowers that are placed almost daily outside the villa that houses the embassy, alongside placards denouncing Russian aggression. “We are deeply grateful to the government of Cyprus for the support and unity it has shown,” he says. “I see that ordinary Cypriots feel our pain.” President Nicos Anastasiades has said his compatriots’ experience of war, division and ongoing Turkish occupation underpins local compassion towards Ukraine. But EU diplomats and analysts say official condemnation of Russia’s move towards war was slow at first. “Russia was not mentioned by name because they didn’t want to offend a power perceived to be pro-Greek Cypriot in the UN security council even if, in reality, Moscow has no interest in a solution of the Cyprus problem since keeping the island divided and out of Nato suits it just fine,” says Hubert Faustmann, professor of history and political science at the University of Nicosia. It was only when, days before the invasion, Putin recognised the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk “people’s republics” as independent states that alarm bells sounded in government circles. “It was too close to the situation here,” Faustmann says, referring to the breakaway Turkish republic of northern Cyprus that unilaterally declared independence in 1983, nine years after Ankara sent in troops prompted by a coup aimed at uniting the island with Greece. For a country so dependent on tourism, Cyprus will pay a heavy price for its support of sanctions. The island’s GDP is projected to contract by 2%, largely because of the closure of Cypriot airspace to Russia, the island’s second largest tourist market after the UK. “Tourism accounts for 20% of our GDP and it has become increasingly dependent on Russians,” says Philokypros Roussounides, the Cyprus Hotel Association’s director general. “Before Ukraine, we were talking of a 10%-to-15% increase in Russians and Ukrainians who together make up around 22% of our entire tourism pie. The impact is definitely going to be big.” Stanislav Osadchiy, Moscow’s longtime ambassador to Cyprus, has already said that Nicosia has “shot itself in the foot” by backing measures “aimed at demonising” his country. After predicting Russian tourists would instead head to Turkey, which has not endorsed the flight ban, he made clear that Moscow was watching Cyprus closely. “Everything will be taken into account [including] those measures that Nicosia will take in relation to our country,” he told Phileleftheros, a Cypriot daily. “For our part, we will try to maintain those good relations which were previously formed. We hope that Nicosia will respond in a similar way.” Kasoulidis is sanguine. “All EU member states have some impact from the sanctions. They were unavoidable and we all agreed in unanimity about them,” he says, insisting that while Nicosia has reserved the right to lift the ban on Russian flights, if Turkey fails to follow suit, he does not think it would. “We are working to bring tourists in from other areas. It is anyway better to diversify our sources.”",News/World news,Cyprus: displaced Ukrainians adjust to life in Russia-friendly resort,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/displaced-ukrainians-adjusting-to-life-in-cyprus
3/23/2022,"On a mission to quicken the Big Apple’s economic recovery, New York City’s freshly installed mayor, Eric Adams, was among those attending at Ralph Lauren’s first physical fashion show since the pandemic at the Museum of Modern Art. Adams posed with Anna Wintour, in her customary dark glasses, and tweeted after Tuesday night’s show that his attendance had been conceived to “celebrate the groundbreaking work of @RalphLauren and to send a clear message: #NYCisBack!”. Devised months ago, with an optimistic mood and hoped-for return to normality in mind, the set was a sleek, monochrome recreation of the designer’s Manhattan residence. Actors including Lily Collins and Jessica Chastain sat in the audience, with supermodels Gigi and Bella Hadid, Shalom Harlow and Tyson Beckford on the catwalk. Clothes were designed for cocktail hour and the boardroom, ranging from shimmering cut out dresses to houndstooth and checked Annie Hall-style layered suiting. The final look was not a wedding dress, as has sometimes been customary, but a New York Yankees baseball cap and varsity jacket worn over a tuxedo. These were ideal clothes for a longed-for return to carefree city life, a dream that felt a lot closer a few months ago when the event was conceived, said Lauren, in notes distributed at the show. A few months ago, he said: “there was no war in Ukraine. The tragedy and devastation we are witnessing now was unthinkable. Back then all I could think about was coming back together with my teams and all of you to share the hopefulness that collaboration and creativity can inspire. So, in the midst of this sadness, we go forward united in our hope for peace, and our hope for the end of this pandemic and a return to being together. I am so proud to be with you again sharing not only a collection, but an optimism for living that respects the dignity of all”. Frequently held up as the living embodiment of the American Dream, Lauren caused few surprises by using his return to the catwalk to celebrate New York City. The son of Jewish immigrant parents from Belarus, who grew up in Queens in relative poverty as Ralph Lipschitz, Lauren launched his own fashion line in 1967 and is now, at the age of 82, worth $7.2bn. The themes of his work mirror his life story, exploring Americana and taking tropes associated with an “old money” lifestyle – most famously polo shirts – and selling them widely. Last week, Ralph Lauren’s Polo line unveiled a well-received collaboration with two historically black universities – Morehouse College and Spelman College – comprising of varsity jackets, logo sweaters and three piece suits. The collection, modelled by an all-black cast of students, was inspired by a conversation with a Lauren employee, design director James Jeter, who is a Morehouse graduate, during the Black Lives Matter protests of summer 2020. Lauren said it was “about sharing a more complete and authentic portrait of American style and of the American dream – ensuring stories of Black life and experiences are embedded in the inspiration and aspiration of our brand.” Along with brands such as H&M, Hermes and Prada, Ralph Lauren label announced it would pause all operations in Russia on 7 March.",Lifestyle/Fashion,“#NYCisBack!”: Ralph Lauren celebrates Big Apple in first show since the pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/23/nycisback-ralph-lauren-celebrates-big-apple-in-first-show-since-the-pandemic
