2/23/2022,"Australia is spending billions to build thousands of kilometres of new gas pipelines that may end up worthless stranded assets as the world moves to deal with climate change. The warning comes in a new report by Global Energy Monitor tracking 600km of pipelines currently under construction and 12,200km of proposed new infrastructure across Australia, with the total value of this work amounting to $25.8bn (USD$18.6bn).  According to the report, these projects include “substantial capacity expansions planned along the existing national network”, which “highlights the Australian government’s unbridled enthusiasm” for the gas industry despite the risk of creating stranded assets. Should they all go ahead, these pipelines would lock in decades of new production in several basins on the east coast including Beetaloo and Narrabri, and the Scarborough gas field in the north-west, by connecting them to export terminals. While the projects tracked in the report are consistent with what appears in the 2021 National Gas Plan, it also includes the west-east pipeline proposed by former Dow Chemical Global chairman Andrew Liveris. Liveris, the CEO of oil and gas engineering consultancy Worley and director of the world’s largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, revived the idea of a $6bn trans-continental pipeline in 2020 as an architect of the Australian government’s gas-fired recovery in response to the global pandemic. The proposal – first suggested in the mid-1970s – has long been considered unviable for a range of reasons and the most recent iteration has faced opposition even from within the fossil fuel sector. Australia’s building boom comes amid $485.8bn in pipeline construction activity globally – made up of 408 new pipelines, 70,900km of which are currently under construction and an additional 122,500km planned – despite a global push to divest from new fossil fuel investment. “The world is at an inflection point, where it can hasten the transition to renewables or further entrench itself in fossil fuels,” the report says. “It is choosing the latter.” The burning of fossil fuels such as gas is a key driver of global heating. Last year the International Energy Agency said limiting global heating to 1.5C, a goal set out in the Paris agreement, meant exploration and exploitation of new fossil fuel basins had to stop in 2021. Dan Gocher, Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility’s director of climate and the environment, said the scale of construction in Australia showed the “toxic level of influence” fossil fuel companies had on government. “We don’t need the gas,” Gocher said. “Gas demand on the east coast is forecast to flatline or decline. And once state governments get serious about addressing domestic gas demand that demand will really start to decrease. “It’s a massive stranded asset risk either for the taxpayers that build them or the companies that operate them.” Tim Buckley, energy transition analyst and director of Clean Energy Finance, said despite “platitudes to decarbonisation” companies were not taking divestment risk seriously. But he said that would change over the next few years as governments and regulatory authorities begin to crack down on “greenwash” and large investors grow serious about pulling their money out of fossil fuel production. “You can’t keep investing half a billion bucks in gas pipelines and think that in anyway that aligns with the Paris targets,” Buckley said. “When you build a gas pipeline you build it for 50 years, we’ve got a climate emergency which we need to act on in eight years. How can you build an asset like that when you have to change by 2050?” Global Energy Monitor is a San Francisco based energy monitor that tracks new fossil fuel developments and advocates for a transition to clean energy. It also publishes the Global Coal Plant Tracker, which follows investment in new coal power plants worldwide.",News/Australia news,Australia spending billions on new gas pipelines that may end up worthless stranded assets,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/23/australia-spending-billions-on-new-gas-pipelines-that-may-end-up-worthless-stranded-assets
2/23/2022,"The motto of Black-owned New York fashion brand Telfar is “It’s not for you – it’s for everybody”. If this has been hailed as a win for inclusivity, the epic show at New York fashion week was about defining what that meant for designer Telfar Clemens and his collaborators. A press release, handed out to guests, asked “how can a Black business with almost entirely Black customers - be the result of someone else’s inclusivity?” The exploration of what inclusivity means to Clemens and collaborators was an assault on the senses.  It began with a film from Telfar TV – the channel set up by the brand earlier this year. With the raw but fun feel of late night TV, presenters included designer Telfar Clemens and singer Ian Isiah, with different fans of the brand calling in, spontaneous prayers and sleepcams. This was followed by a more conventional fashion show, with a diverse cast and live experimental jazz collective, Solange collaborators Standing On The Corner Art Ensemble. The models wore an extremely covetable collection of sportswear-influenced clothes – the inspiration for which began with Clemens’ work for the Liberian Olympic team last year (he is Liberian-American). Here there were longline basketball shirts to baseball tops and ski suits. A pair of tracksuit trousers with cut-outs on the model’s legs managed to give a new spin to this extremely familiar item. The Telfar T logo found on its sell-out bags was transposed to the top of knee-high boots set to be equally in demand next season. After a further screening from Telfar TV, a second part of the collection was debuted – with oversized denim, long skirts and more baseball shirts. It culminated with all the models, Clemens and collaborators flooding the stage. “Wow,” said Clemens over a microphone. Any guest watching the hour-long visual spectacle would have to agree. Telfar was founded in 2005 by Clemens and his business partner Babak Radboy. Initially popular within the club scene they were part of, the brand hit the radar of the wider fashion industry with the vegan leather shopping bags they are now known for. First on the catwalk in 2014, the bags – which were based on the dimensions of a Bloomingdale’s bag – have become a runway success. Sometimes called the “Bushwick Birkin” thanks to its popularity in the fashionable Brooklyn area, the bags have now been worn by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Oprah and Solange, and won Telfar the Fashion Design of 2020 award from the Design Museum. The bag was a pandemic success story. Lyst named Telfar’s medium shopping bag the “hottest product” in the third quarter. Searches for the brand rose 61% while demand for its totes increased 270%.",Lifestyle/Fashion,New York Fashion Week: inclusivity centre stage at raw and diverse Telfar Clemens show ,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/feb/23/new-york-fashion-week-inclusivity-centre-stage-at-raw-and-diverse-telfar-clemens-show
2/23/2022,"Fred believes Manchester United being led by an interim manager in Ralf Rangnick is causing uncertainty that is “a little bit bad” for the team. Although Rangnick has lost only one league game since his arrival, Fred claimed United are unstable as a result of the temporary nature of his role. “It’s a bit strange,” the midfielder told TNT Sports Brazil.  “I know in football it’s important to get good results as soon as possible but it’s also important to have a long-term plan. I think it’s a little bit bad for us not to have one. At the moment it’s all about the short-term goals. We don’t know how it’s going to be after the end of this season.” Although Rangnick has a chance of being appointed as the permanent manager, Paris Saint-Germain’s Mauricio Pochettino and Ajax’s Erik ten Hag are the frontrunners. Rangnick takes United to Atlético Madrid for their Champions League last-16 first leg on Wednesday. Fred expects a feisty tie against Diego Simeone’s side, who are 15 points off Real Madrid at the summit of La Liga. “Even when not playing well, they’re a hard team to beat,” the Brazilian said. “Their manager is Argentinian, so they’re warriors, defend really well. They like a bit of a fight on the pitch and play collectively as a unit. So it really doesn’t matter if Atlético is going through a bad moment. It’s a match for players that have balls – pardon my French. They’re the most South American team in the Champions League.” Fred said he was aware of the criticism his displays can draw from United supporters. “It’s a mixed bag: some fans like me and others don’t,” he said. “It’s all about the results and they will dictate the supporters’ mood. But sometimes even with good results you’ll be criticised as well. “I’m not the best player, the most technical, but I give my blood and life every time I’m on the pitch. As we say in Brazil, I carry the piano for the artists to play. It’s been nice to play lately more as a box-to-box midfielder. It’s my favourite position – I’ve been creating chances and even scoring. It’s similar to the position I play internationally for Brazil.” The 28-year-oldHe embraces how his midfield partnership with Scott McTominay has been nicknamed “McFred”. “I like it,” he said. “I’m very happy to play alongside him but also it’s important to value every member of our midfield.” Bruno Fernandes believes United have more identity under Rangnick than under Ole Gunnar Solskjær, who was sacked in November. “We have to follow what the manager thinks is the best way for us,” Fernandes said. “In this club I never heard someone complain about the tactics. I hope no one will do that – it is not respectful to the manager. We have been doing so well since he arrived. We have more identity as a team, I think.”",Sport/Football,Fred says Rangnick’s interim status ‘a little bit bad’ for Manchester United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/22/fred-says-rangnicks-interim-status-a-little-bit-bad-for-manchester-united
2/23/2022,"The Australian Bureau of Statistics last week released a new report on Covid mortality in Australia. The data is important – it exposes the inequality in how the pandemic is affecting Australians, with deaths higher among people from lower socioeconomic areas, and shockingly high death rates for people born outside Australia. Experts told Guardian Australia a key reason for this is Australia’s reliance on migrants to undertake essential, insecure work and a failure of government to engage migrant communities early in pandemic planning.  These are issues rarely heard about from politicians and some media outlets during the pandemic, despite the trends being clear since at least August 2020. However, rightwing radio hosts and columnists saw something different in the figures – support for an ongoing narrative that lockdowns and other interventions represented an “overreaction” or were the result of a “scare campaign”. Paul Murray, on SkyNews Australia: Of the 2,639 deaths, 96.7% of those already had serious, life-threatening underlying health conditions … So, how many people have actually died, not with, but exclusively from Covid in Australia in the past couple of years? It is 83. Now every one of those is absolutely a tragedy, as is the two and a bit thousand before that. Murray went on to use this figure to question government responses: Get rid of the codes, pull down the borders, take care of the people that are most at risk. Ben Fordham, on 2GB and then repeated on news.com.au: We know Covid-19 is serious, but it doesn’t warrant the fear campaign we’ve been seeing. Today we have further proof. This isn’t opinion, it is certified data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Then later in the broadcast Fordham said: Again, let me be clear because some people take these stats the wrong way. We’re not playing down the situation, we’re not ignoring the grief of families. But these records expose the overblown scare campaign that we’ve witnessed. In 92% of our Covid-related deaths to 31 January each patient had roughly three other underlying health conditions. In other words it wasn’t just Covid that claimed their lives. And finally, he summed up: If you’re overweight or smoking, you’re putting yourself in danger, and you’re more likely to be in the 1% of Australians who have died with coronavirus. Yes, 1%. If you need any further evidence that it’s time to get on with our lives, you’ve just heard it. Rita Panahi, writing in the Herald Sun (the online version is different to the original): The Australian Bureau of Statistics put out some crucial data this week that should shame every alarmist bureaucrat, politician and media blowhard who championed lockdowns, school closures and mandates. Of the 2,639 deaths from or with Covid-19 in Australia, 2,556 had serious pre-existing conditions, on average three pre-existing conditions. That means more than 91% of Covid-19 deaths in Australia, up until 31 January 2022, had underlying health issues, with cancer, dementia and chronic cardiac conditions among the most common pre-existing conditions. And then later in the article, after comparing the number of Covid deaths to the annual number of deaths: It’s hard not to conclude we needlessly crippled our societies, debased our hard fought for liberties and caused untold damage to children, not to mention accumulating enormous debt and destroying countless lives and livelihoods. Joe Hildebrand, writing in news.com.au: And now we have formal confirmation from the Australian Bureau of Statistics that not only did so-called “Covid deaths” account for just 1% of fatalities during the pandemic, but 92% of that 1% were people with pre-existing health problems ranging from pneumonia to heart disease. All the scare-mongering was wrong, all the catastrophic predictions were wrong, all the fear and fury at lifting of restrictions was wrong, wrong, wrong. Besides the lack of originality in these opinion pieces, there are quite a few problems here. All of them managed to get at least one of the basic numbers from the ABS report wrong, with some of them messing up multiple stats. They’re also misrepresenting what the numbers actually mean. Paul Murray got both the number of people who died from Covid wrong, and the proportion of deaths where people had a chronic condition, prompting this fact check by AAP after his incorrect numbers were shared on Facebook and Twitter. The actual number of deaths where only Covid was reported on the death certificate was 220, not 83 – which is actually the number of people who died primarily due to something else, but who had also tested positive to Covid. The same mistake was made by the Herald Sun in a now-deleted tweet linking to Rita Panahi’s piece, which is strange as Panahi does not use the 83 figure. Fordham, Panahi, Hildebrand and Murray all got the percentage of Covid deaths with underlying health conditions wrong, citing 91% or 92% when it should actually be 69.5%. They’ve used the number of cases where only Covid was reported on the death certificate, which is 220 or 8.6% of total Covid deaths in this period, and subtracted this from the total. However, they should have included a further 560 deaths where another condition was “reported with causal sequence of events only”. This means those people did not have a pre-existing chronic condition prior to the chain of events leading to death, but conditions that developed due to Covid-19, such as pneumonia. While this may seem a bit complicated, the ABS clearly states within the same report the actual number of deaths with pre-existing chronic conditions in very plain terms: “Pre-existing chronic conditions were reported on death certificates for 1,776 (69.5%) of the 2,556 deaths due to Covid-19 deaths outlined in this report.” Another major issue is that several of these commentators imply that deaths are somehow not fully attributable to Covid if people had a chronic health condition. Again, the ABS report states in clear terms that this is not the case: “The majority [2,556] of these 2,639 deaths were due directly to Covid-19”. While various health conditions and other factors such as age can put you at an increased risk of dying if you catch Covid, it is an increased risk, not a guaranteed death sentence. To put it another way – if it weren’t for Covid these people would not have died when they did. It’s also important to realise that a very large number of Australians have chronic health conditions (I’ve got one myself!), so implying that deaths of entirely healthy people are somehow more important is unhelpful. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) estimates that 47% of Australians aged 18 and over had one or more chronic health conditions, and this rises to 60% in the 45 to 64 age bracket, and to 80% for those over 65. While the AIHW figures include conditions like back problems and mental and behavioural conditions not included in the ABS Covid deaths report, other figures show how widespread these conditions are. One in three Australians have high blood pressure, and a similar proportion of adults are obese. Both are on the list of the pre-existing chronic conditions listed in the ABS report. Unfortunately, according to data from social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle, most of these articles have been enthusiastically shared by accounts known for sharing anti-vaccination and anti-lockdown conspiracy theories. This is likely because questioning how many deaths are actually due to Covid alone is an ongoing theme for these communities. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Another issue with several of the opinion pieces is that they make an argument that I’ve taken to calling the “Y2K fallacy“ for lack of a better term. They’re using the comparatively low number of Covid deaths relative to other deaths over the same period to make the argument that people overstated the seriousness of Covid or the need for various interventions. However, this ignores the fact that this comparatively low number of deaths has been achieved by interventions including lockdowns, border controls, mask rules and vaccinations, and without these, the death toll would have undoubtedly been higher. One estimate in October 2020 suggested Australia’s interventions may have saved 16,000 lives. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, suggested in May 2021 that Australia had avoided the loss of 30,000 lives. That’s not to say that every intervention necessarily worked, or that there wasn’t a health and financial cost to strict policies like lockdowns and border controls, but to argue that these death numbers show that we have “needlessly crippled our societies” is misleading in the extreme.",News/Australia news,Australian Bureau of Statistics report on Covid deaths misrepresented by rightwing media,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/23/australian-bureau-of-statistics-report-on-covid-deaths-misrepresented-by-rightwing-media
2/23/2022,"Jürgen Klopp has said the punishing demands of a title race with Manchester City ensure Liverpool can never afford to “get a bit soft” in their pursuit of the Premier League leaders. Klopp’s team can close the gap to three points on Wednesday by winning their game in hand on City against Leeds at Anfield. Liverpool, who recently trailed Pep Guardiola’s team by 12 points, have won their past eight matches and suffered only two defeats in 48 games in all competitions. Klopp admits that relentlessness must continue to reclaim the title from City.  The Liverpool manager said: “Obviously both teams were able to do some special stuff, I have to say. With all respect, what Man City is doing is incredible and we are pushing each other as well. It is not only us because there is also Chelsea, United, Arsenal, Tottenham, whoever is there. I don’t forget all the other teams. But I think we can say we are pushing each other. It keeps you going. There is no chance to get a bit soft or whatever because the other one will be there immediately to catch you.” Guardiola jokingly referred to Liverpool recently as “a pain in the ass all the time” given the continued threat they pose to City in the Premier League and Champions League. Klopp concurred: “I think Pep said we are the pain in the … lower back. That is a good description and that is how it should be. “We try to be as annoying as possible until we have a chance to overtake. I don’t know when that will be or if it will be the case but in the decisive moments of the season – which is not now in February but in March or April – you have to be close enough to make a decision in your direction. “We have to be at our absolute best to play the best possible season for us. And unfortunately only twice a year we face the ‘other team’ in the Premier League. The first one was a draw when we were not brilliant but good enough to get a point. The next one has not been played yet and we play all the others as well. “It is just difficult, but what the boys did over the past four years is pretty special. I am happy with that but not overly happy where I think that is enough. We have to go from now on. So far it is not a bad season but the decisions will be made later. We just have to make sure that we are always in and around when these decisions are made.” Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino will again be absent against Leeds as they recover from ankle and muscle injuries respectively. The strikers have not been ruled out of Sunday’s Carabao Cup final against Chelsea but Klopp cautioned: “They are not on the pitch for training and that is not a good sign.”",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp warns Liverpool not to ‘get soft’ in their Premier League title pursuit,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/22/jurgen-klopp-warns-liverpool-not-to-get-soft-in-their-title-pursuit
2/23/2022,"For Antonio Conte, defeat has always felt like a mortal insult, a scar on the soul, and it is not difficult to imagine how low he was after Tottenham’s shambolic home loss to Wolves on the Sunday before last. It came hard on the heels of the defeat against Southampton – also at home, also deserved – and nobody was particularly optimistic about their chances when they went to the Premier League leaders, Manchester City, on Saturday. Cue the Harry Kane-inspired 3-2 win, one of the shock results of the season and, certainly, the statement performance of Conte’s near four-month tenure. Kane scored two, including a 95th-minute winner, and might have had four but he helped to set the tone with his work rate, always “linking with the team defensively”, to borrow Conte’s words.  Conte’s players ran their socks off, they put their bodies on the line, they followed his tactical instructions to the letter. There was even a bit of nastiness, at times. And, for Conte, it added up to evidence that his messages about mentality were getting through. It is doubtful that anyone at Spurs will ever torture themselves quite so much as the manager after a bad result. But Conte suggested that those against Wolves and Southampton had stirred something in his players; something he wants to see again and again, picking up at Burnley on Wednesday night. “It’s very simple,” Conte said . “We lost two games against Wolverhampton and Southampton and then we won against City. The first step to change your mentality is, after a loss, you have to understand that you lost a game and, for sure, the atmosphere has to be different. When you lose a game and you come back to the training ground and, OK, it’s the same like yesterday … but yesterday you lost! “If we start to change the atmosphere, to understand that atmosphere also depends on the win or the defeat … because when you know that the atmosphere is different, you try during the game to do everything to have a good atmosphere the day after or two days after.” Conte brought up Bayern Munich, who suffered a shock Bundesliga defeat at Bochum on the Saturday before last and then drew at Red Bull Salzburg in the Champions League. They got back on track with a home win over Greuther Fürth on Sunday. “I read that the Bayern players were very, very angry,” Conte said. “They said: ‘No. We can’t continue this way. We have to be strong.’ You show you are feeling that. The situation has to be different when you win and lose. Otherwise, if the atmosphere is always the same, always joy and celebrations, it will be very difficult to install the right mentality. You have to suffer. If you don’t suffer, it means that you don’t want to improve your winning mentality.” Conte can count on Kane and his goalkeeper and captain, Hugo Lloris, even if the latter made goal-costing errors against Wolves and City. “I continue to say that it’s important to match experienced players with young players because when you have players with experience, the young players learn a lot,” Conte said. “We are lucky to have these two players, who are top, top players.” Conte mentioned a somewhat injudicious line from his friend Pantaleo Corvino, the veteran sporting director at Lecce. “He says that you can make a mistake about your wife but not about your striker and goalkeeper – for me, that is the best quote I understand in football,” Conte said. And when asked whether the knock that Kane took to his back at City might rule him out of the Burnley game, Conte replied: “No. He had a hit in his back but he has to play. If he has one leg, he has to play.” Conte went on to say that he was only joking and he would never force an injured player to play, but, with Kane his only specialist, senior centre-forward, his tongue might not have been entirely in his cheek. It was striking, though, to see Conte in such upbeat mood. He has done plenty of complaining during his time at Spurs, especially about the level of his squad, stoking lots of creative tensions. Post-City, has something changed in him? In the aftermath of victory, Conte had described the group as the best he had coached. “I’m finding a lot of availability of these players to work, to improve, to have more football knowledge,” Conte said. “They are very open. And it’s not certain that this type of situation can happen in every team. Sometimes you find players who want to stay in their comfortable zone, saying: ‘OK, I had my career and I don’t want to prove [anything] and follow you.’ “I come to the training ground with a smile because I know I stay two to three hours with people who want to work seriously and follow a path to improve the level and try to go another step.”",Sport/Football,‘It’s simple’: Tottenham and Conte feel mood change after win at Man City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/22/tottenham-and-antonio-conte-feel-mood-change-after-win-at-city
