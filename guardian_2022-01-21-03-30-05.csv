1/21/2022,"Secondary schools across England say they will encourage students to wear masks indoors while the Omicron variant continues to spread rapidly, despite the government’s announcement curtailing the wearing of masks in classrooms this week. The move comes as many schools report severe staff shortages, with some primary schools asking parents to conduct daily lateral flow tests on their children before coming to school.  Headteachers say Boris Johnson’s announcement on Wednesday that the government would no longer advise wearing masks in classrooms took them by surprise and gave them no opportunity to consult parents or local authorities. Schools North East, a network in the north-east of England, said 80% of schools in the region planned to retain some Covid-related measures, with many secondary schools retaining face masks in classrooms and communal areas. Case rates in England remain highest in the north-east, with 1,410 reported per 100,000 people. A majority of schools in the region reported that more than 10% of staff and students were absent, while one in four said 20% or more of their staff were off. “Schools are still facing real challenges in getting staff cover, increasing staff workload and stress and impacting negatively on wellbeing. There are serious concerns for schools, with local pictures often radically different from the national picture,” said Chris Zarraga, the director of Schools North East. St Peter’s Church of England school in Exeter is among those that has told parents it plans to continue with masks worn indoors, citing predictions that Covid cases would continue to increase around Devon. “Despite the prime minister’s announcement [on Wednesday] regarding wearing of face masks in classrooms, I will be requesting that students do wear them in classrooms as well as corridors in line with other local and national schools,” the headteacher, Phil Randall, said in a message to parents. Wearing a mask was “a kind and thoughtful approach that supports our school community and our families, many of whom have vulnerable children and adults living with them,” Randall said. Andy Byers, the headteacher of Framwellgate school in Durham, said face masks were still needed because Covid rates in the region remained high. Byers wrote to parents on Wednesday evening notifying them of the decision, telling them that more than 60 students at the school were currently absent due to Covid, as well as 10 members of staff. “Speaking to colleagues in other local secondary schools, we are all in a similar position,” with high levels of absence, some students missing important face-to-face teaching and a reliance on temporary supply teachers to fill in for absent staff, Byers said. Other schools, including those in the Harris Federation multi-academy trust, said that masks would be optional for pupils who wanted to wear them. The rate of new cases of Covid-19 among primary schoolchildren in England has reached record levels, according to new data from the UK Health Security Agency. The figures show 1,936 cases per 100,000 five to nine-year-olds in the week to January 16, up 41% from the previous week. While masks have never been advised for primary school pupils, headteachers are taking other measures. Helmshore primary school in Rossendale, Lancashire, this week asked parents to give their children lateral flow tests every day, after six staff members and 26 pupils at the school tested positive. Greatfield Park primary school in Cheltenham has also asked parents and carers to test their children every morning. Worcestershire county council said it has been working with 41 schools for “Covid-related support” since Monday. Hanley Castle high school in Worcestershire is among those retaining mask-wearing indoors, with head teacher Lindsey Cooke telling the BBC the school wanted more time to see if local infection rates were falling. “Our year 11 and year 13 exam groups have missed so much school already, what we do not want to do is to rush into taking masks off and then get another outbreak in those year groups,” Cooke said. The government’s advice since the start of the school year has been for pupils in year 7 and above to wear masks in communal areas such as corridors. When schools reopened after Christmas, the advice included wearing of masks in classrooms. But Johnson told MPs on Wednesday that the advice for classrooms would be withdrawn the next day, while the advice to wear masks in communal areas would end on 27 January, along with other plan B measures. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, defended the decision because of national falling case numbers and the impact of mask-wearing on learning. “The government’s job is to take a balanced and proportionate decision, in this case balanced against the best interests of children. It is harder to teach children and it will have an impact on their education if they are required to wear masks,” Javid said.",News/Education,Masks to stay in many secondary schools despite England rule change,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/20/masks-to-stay-in-many-secondary-schools-despite-england-rule-change
1/21/2022,"Austria has announced plans to give Covid-19 vaccine recipients an almost one-in-three chance to win a €500 (£415) gift voucher while MPs voted to fine those who decline it, as the Alpine republic implements its “carrot and stick” strategy for overcoming reluctance to take the jab. The conservative-green coalition government of chancellor Karl Nehammer on Thursday morning unveiled what it called its “vaccination lottery” programme, which will run from 15 March until the end of the year and cost the government approximately €1.4bn.  Under the scheme, Austrians will receive a ticket for each shot of vaccine they take or have already taken, meaning those who have got their booster jab will hold three tickets. Approximately every tenth ticket will win a €500 gift voucher that can be redeemed in shops, restaurants, tourism and at cultural or sporting events. In addition, Austria is trying to encourage local authorities to promote the immunisation programme by tying vaccination rates to additional funding. Nehammer cited an example whereby an administrative district with a population of 3,000 would be rewarded with €30,000 if it managed to jab 80% of its population – or €120,000 for a 90% rate. About 72% of Austria’s population are considered fully immunised after receiving either a booster shot or their second dose within the last six months, one of the lower rates in western Europe. Critics say the vaccination lottery programme is at odds with a general vaccination mandate due to be phased in from February, under which people who refuse to have a jab are fined up to €3,600. The lower house of Austria’s parliament on Thursday afternoon voted 137-33 to make vaccines mandatory for all adults except for pregnant women and people who are advised against vaccination on health grounds. If, as is expected, the law is also approved by the upper house, on 3 February, it will come into immediate effect but will not be enforced until mid-March, and even then only through spot checks. Initial fines of €600 can increase up to €3,600. Because of logistical challenges, a systematic enforcement of the vaccine mandate, drawing on Austria’s digital vaccination registry, will not be possible until April. By then, the government said, it hoped to have achieved a high enough pickup among the population to make such enforcement redundant.",News/World news,Austria creates Covid lottery with €500 prizes to woo vaccine hesitant,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/20/austria-creates-covid-lottery-with-500-prizes-to-woo-vaccine-hesitant
1/21/2022,"Henry Slade will seemingly be able to take part in England’s entire Six Nations campaign after he was declared available for Exeter’s trip to Montpellier this weekend. England face away matches against Italy and France, where both governments have introduced restrictions which effectively rule out players who have not been fully vaccinated. Slade has previously expressed hesitancy over the vaccine but the Exeter director of rugby, Rob Baxter, hinted on Thursday that the 28-year-old centre is now fully jabbed after revealing he can play against Montpellier on Sunday.  Slade’s availability this weekend bodes well for England and their coach, Eddie Jones. Slade was among England’s best performers in the autumn and England’s trip to France on the final weekend of the championship could prove decisive. On this weekend’s match, Baxter said: “He’s available, yes. I don’t think we’ve got any player who is actually available who can’t go. I know Henry doesn’t mind me saying this, Henry never said he wasn’t going to get vaccinated. He said at the time he wanted to see what the situation was, and that was months and months ago. “He never said he wasn’t going to have it, he said he wanted to see what the situation was. [The French government requirements] have had virtually no effect on us. It is not for me to discuss players’ medical status, you will see the team and we have not got any players with medical exemptions so there is no Novak Djokovic situation.” Meanwhile, the Rugby Football Union is weighing up whether to drop the requirement for supporters to have Covid passes for England’s two home matches against Wales on 26 February and Ireland on 12 March. The RFU stipulated that supporters must have a valid Covid pass for the three autumn matches in November even though the government had not yet introduced its plan B measures. Those measures are due to be lifted before the end of January but the RFU is conducting talks with the DCMS, the local authority and medical experts before making a decision. Supporters traveling to Murrayfield for England’s opening match against Scotland on 5 February must have either proof of vaccination or a negative lateral flow test. England fans can also attend the match in Rome on 13 February but will have to be fully vaccinated or be able to demonstrate they have recently recovered from Covid.",Sport/Sport,Slade’s availability for Montpellier trip gives England Six Nations boost,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/20/henry-slade-availability-for-montpellier-trip-gives-england-six-nations-boost
1/21/2022,"The culture secretary’s recent attacks on the BBC – freezing the licence fee for two years, promising a dire funding vacuum when the royal charter rolls around in 2027 and the TV licence isn’t renewed – lack the power to terrify. Nadine Dorries, clueless and inconsistent, is not a serious politician. More saliently, I can’t see this government in power in 2027. However, the debate has one unsettling element: it reminds me of Brexit. I’m aware of the new common sense, that serious people have moved on, and that it is a childish or hysterical thing to harp on about. But in this case, the parallels are too insistent.  This is the game plan: the right flank of the Tory party attack an institution that is so much a part of national life that you’re minded, initially, to ignore them. They may as well attack postboxes, or hydrangeas. Nevertheless, they keep going, becoming more trenchant. The rhetoric appeals to, and mobilises, their base: it doesn’t make much logical sense (what does a Surrey pensioner have against Brussels? Don’t Somerset landowners love the Archers?), but it’s understandable at some hindbrain level, an act of self-assertion. You think we’re yesterday’s people? Let’s see how relevant we are when we’ve broken everything. There follows a sudden, on-the-back-foot scramble to express everything people love about the institution: look what amazing value for money it is, its rich history, its noble foundations, its global reach, its many triumphs. There’s a bit of disbelief and discombobulation (who would ever want to destroy these good institutions, so painstakingly built?), self-soothed with number crunching – the BBC costs just 43p a day, for this richness. A resistant stance takes shape, a form of progressive conservationism. There’s nothing wrong with resistance, but now the progressive side is riven by a fundamental contradiction. Left-liberal politics simply doesn’t exist to stand around with muscles clenched saying “Everything is great, please don’t change it”; it draws its energy from critical analysis, from trying to make change, from progress. A few on its edges, understandably, would prefer to see the whole thing burn than to live with their new role as aggrieved cheerleaders, and they become Lexiteers, or people who are happy to see the BBC destroyed because they think Laura Kuenssberg is partisan. It is precisely because Dorries has such slim prospects that it’s worth the risk of having this conversation differently. Have you ever thought the BBC needed to change? Have you ever found it too servile to the sitting governments, or too dominated by the print media’s agenda, or insufficiently responsive to a digital age, or lacking diversity? In 2018, a few proposals were made: the election of some board members by staff and licence fee payers; transparency about workforce diversity; a permanent statutory footing, to end political control through charter renewal; a digital licence fee paid by tech giants or internet service providers, to reduce the costs for poorer households. These sober ideas, having emanated from Jeremy Corbyn, were written off at the time as indicative of a dangerous, borderline totalitarian attempt at controlling the media, even though they address all the problems of household cost and impartiality raised by Dorries and her allies, without starting a bin fire. But it would be childish, hysterical, to relitigate. The writer Dan Hind and academic Tom Mills posed much further-reaching questions that same year: what if there were a partner organisation, a British Digital Corporation, that could function as a platform for news and civic participation, incorporating online payment systems and platforms for sale and exchange: a Facebook, PayPal and eBay rolled into one, except not extractive or commercial or private, but publicly funded and transparent. How would that interact with, and change, the BBC? How could the BBC foster real diversity and launch a more robust defence against fake news? How could it disperse its power across regions, and get away from the current hierarchy in which the centre controls discussion of the “big issues”. I returned to that last idea in the light not of Dorries but of the Downing Street parties. There are two elements to that scandal: the shambolic unravelling of the prime minister and his revellers; and the contrasting accounts from citizens, burying their loved ones at socially distanced funerals, paying vast fines for tiny infractions. It is at once a national and a local story. There’s no shame in the fact that the BBC didn’t uncover it, as other investigative news organisations are available. But its journalistic scrutiny trailed behind that of the print media – “peripheral” details of people’s lives, the stories of the relatives whose funerals they were not able to go to, the people they were not able to see, were not deemed relevant until they had the crunch of Westminster hypocrisy to give them texture. Never mind the politics: this was a news gathering failure, which came from outdated norms in public service broadcasting over who gets to stay silent and who gets to be heard. Criticism is a precondition for imagining change, and the potential to change and modernise is what makes any institution truly valuable, rather than a much-loved relic. We should never be chased from the territory of what could be better by the threat of those who long for the worst.

1/21/2022,"While it remains to be seen whether Tory opponents of Boris Johnson can generate enough MPs’ letters to trigger a confidence vote in the prime minister, let alone win one, it is clear that the parliamentary party contains a series of factions with their own gripes and wishes, some overlapping. By no means do all of them actively want Johnson gone – at least not yet – but they do at least hope his current woes could prompt a No 10 reset in a direction they would like. Here is a brief guide to who is seeking what.  Grouping together the largely overlapping contingents of fervent Brexiters and low-tax, low-spend Tories, these MPs are frustrated that after departure from the EU Johnson has not fully seized what they believe are the opportunities for slashing regulations and focusing on growth through unfettered free enterprise. Often citing Singapore as an example – while ignoring elements of the city-state’s model such as mass social housing – they want the government shrunk and taxes cut. As a starting point they would like the imminent rise in national insurance cancelled. Steve Baker is a key proponent of this (and several other) issues. Best represented by the European Research Group, which played a pivotal role in toppling Theresa May, these share many of the small-state views of the above, but with a particular focus on Brexit-related issues, particularly the impasse over Northern Ireland. They would like Johnson or his successor to trigger article 16 as a means to resetting the Irish border issue, and to take a combative line more generally with the EU. A key No 10 role for David Frost would be welcomed. Also largely represented by a formal and influential body – the Covid Recovery Group, headed by the former chief whip Mark Harper – these MPs will have been cheered by the announcement on Wednesday of government plans to phase out more or less every remaining pandemic rule in England over the next few weeks. However, they would still like more assurances from Johnson and from the health secretary, Sajid Javid, that such restrictions will never return. A group that often crystallises wider Tory worries over the cost of living, this increasingly influential contingent says the best way to reduce energy prices would be to not just remove VAT from bills but also green-based taxes, which pay for renewable energy schemes and the like. More widely, some such as Craig Mackinlay oppose targets for an end to conventionally powered cars and gas boilers, while some want investment in domestic gas and shale gas production. By no means a unified or coherent group, not least because there are 107 MPs who first joined the Commons in the landslide Tory election win, 2019ers have nonetheless been at the centre of efforts to remove Johnson due to the party allegations, in the so-called pork pie putsch, named after the Rutland and Melton constituency of one member, Alicia Kearns. The motive appears to be largely that they feel let down and worry that the man who helped propel them into parliament is now electorally toxic. Some longer-standing Tory MPs say part of the rebellion is down to some 2019ers’ annoyance at missing out on promotion, but this is arguably a factor in most attempts to change prime ministers. Like the Brexiters, this contingent has probably got much of what it wanted out of Johnson. Such efforts are led by Munira Mirza, a key figure in No 10 policy, who has helped oversee initiatives including a report on racial disparities that largely dismissed structural factors, and a robust defence of the rights of statues. However, some want more, perhaps not least the Common Sense Group, led by the veteran MP John Hayes, which opposes what it calls “subversives” such as Extinction Rebellion and Black Lives Matter. Some of these MPs suspect Johnson remains an Islington liberal at heart, and might prefer someone such as Liz Truss. The final group is the most disparate but is united by one thing: they have openly called for Johnson to step down. A handful, such as Caroline Nokes, are from the more obviously liberal wing of the party, and never had a huge amount of faith in Johnson. Others, such as Andrew Bridgen, are former supporters who have become disillusioned. Their policy ask is very simple: that he quits.",News/Politics,From Brexit ultras to net zero sceptics: what the Tory factions want,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/20/from-brexit-ultras-to-net-zero-sceptics-what-the-tory-factions-want
1/21/2022,"Vishal Garg, the CEO of online mortgage lender Better.com, has officially returned to work after taking a hiatus in December when he was criticised for firing more than 900 employees by video chat. In a letter sent to Better.com employees and reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, the company’s board of directors announced Garg’s return, saying he had reflected on his leadership style and received executive coaching during his time off.  “We are confident in Vishal and in the changes he is committed to making to provide the type of leadership, focus and vision that Better needs at this pivotal time,” it said. The board also said the company’s leadership would be expanded to include a board chairman, a president and a chief of human resources. Last December, Garg, who founded Better.com in 2016, fired more than 900 of his employees over Zoom video chat. The footage of the mass layoffs was posted online and seen by millions. During the call, Garg began by telling employees: “This isn’t news you’re going to want to hear”, and informed them they “are part of the unlucky group that is being laid off”. Following the mass dismissals, Garg went on to accuse his employees of “stealing” from the company by being unproductive, according to Fortune, which confirmed Garg made his comments from an anonymous account on a professional network site. “You guys know that at least 250 of the people terminated were working an average of 2 hours a day while closing in 8 hours+ a day in the payroll system,” he wrote. “They were stealing from you and stealing from our customers who pay the bills that pay our bills.” Following the firings call, Garg held an additional video call with the company’s remaining employees where he warned them that their productivity would be watched. Staff members present at the meeting called his tone “harsh and threatening”. The company responded to the ensuing outcry by announcing Garg would be taking time away from his CEO position, and calling in consultants to address company culture and leadership. Garg also posted a separate apology, saying he “failed to show the appropriate amount of respect and appreciation for the individuals who were affected. “I own the decision to do the layoffs,” Garg said. “But in communicating it, I blundered the execution.

1/21/2022,"My father-in-law, David Hutchison, who has died aged 84, was a multi-skilled precision engineer who created items ranging from Jacobean furniture to a catapult for HMS Ark Royal in his garden shed. He was born in Forest Gate, east London, the only child of Betty Whittaker. She later married Ronnie Hutchison, an actor, writer and variety performer under the name Harry Tate Jnr (and son of the comedian Harry Tate), with whom David would appear on stage and whose surname he took.  Betty was a wardrobe mistress and the house was often visited by celebrities of the 1960s calling for their costumes. David met Morecambe and Wise, Frankie Vaughan, Alma Cogan, and Freddie and the Dreamers, but was particularly bowled over by Sylvia Sims, whom he had to entertain (stall) while her dress was finished. After school in Forest Gate, and in Yapton, West Sussex, he was apprenticed to the gunmaker Holland & Holland (1952-57), where he learned basic engineering skills. Soon afterwards he left to set up his own company, HPI, with a friend – in his garden shed in Chesham Bois, Buckinghamshire – producing thermometers for refrigeration units. These were so successful that David progressed, after a name change to Adam Instruments, to owning two factories in Aylesbury, with a substantial staff . He was completely indiscriminate in hiring – all he required from prospective employees was a willingness to learn. This venture was so successful that at one stage he reckoned that one in three refrigerated lorries on the road carried his gauges. At home he continued to make bespoke precision instruments, and was invited to tender by the MoD. His work for the navy included the mechanism for the catapults and restraining hook on the Ark Royal; before he set to work they sent round an admiral to inspect his shed. His passion was restoring antiques – from furniture to clocks to blunderbusses, all of which were bought as scrap. One Jacobean chair was delivered in worm-eaten pieces in a sack, a clock was in 30 bits, the blunderbuss was a pile of rusty iron. These were all restored to painstaking perfection: if a part was missing he would make it to the original specification. His entire house was furnished with 17th- to 19th-century furniture and artefacts – all restored by him. From David, I learned everything from how to wire an electric cooker to the mains (by telephone instruction) to identifying furniture, clocks, glass and anything else from his preferred period: how it was made, where it was made, what it was made of and whether it was well made or not. He was a man of rare skills and knowledge, generously imparted. David met Barbara Pugh in Kilburn dance hall in the early 1960s, the last of four girls he asked to dance that night – he later excused himself by saying he thought she was too young to be out because of her youthful appearance. They were married in 1964. She survives him, along with two daughters, Amanda (my wife) and Tracey, and three granddaughters, Rosie, Amelia and Isabella.",News/Technology,David Hutchison obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/20/david-hutchison-obituary
1/21/2022,"Tottenham are in talks with Paris Saint-Germain over a deal to loan Tanguy Ndombele to the Ligue 1 leaders. The midfielder is keen on the move, which could include an option for PSG to buy at the end of the season. Discussions are being held over what percentage of Ndombele’s salary, if any, Spurs would pay. The transfer would reunite the 25-year-old with Mauricio Pochettino, who made him Tottenham’s record signing for an initial £55.45m in July 2019 and is now in charge of PSG.  Ndombele’s time at the Premier League club has not been a success, the player showing only flashes of his ability, and he is out of favour under Antonio Conte. Jeered off by Tottenham’s fans when substituted against Morecambe on 9 January, he was not in the squad for the two matches since. After the Morecambe game Conte said in reference to Ndombele: “You have to be good to change the opinions.” The France international, previously with Lyon, was told by the manager in November that he had to work harder and learn to play “for the best of the team”. Wolves have rejected Tottenham’s £15m offer for Adama Traoré, who has 18 months left on his contract, and are holding out for £20m.

1/21/2022,"Energy companies want the government to implement policies to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions, the industry’s leader has said, despite claims from some on the political right that high energy prices should spark a rethink. Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of Energy UK, which represents the industry, said: “The government should press on with net zero policies. That’s something they still need to do. We are missing the carbon budgets.”  She called on ministers to “tighten energy efficiency”, by insulating more homes, and changing planning and construction rules, while developing a strategy for decarbonising the UK’s fleet of gas-fired power stations. She rejected claims that renewable energy had increased costs, saying the problem was clearly an over-reliance on gas, especially for heating. She told a meeting hosted by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit: “The UK is exposed to gas because we have a huge amount of gas burned in our homes, and so helping people get off gas boilers on to other forms of heating technology is critical over the next decades to reduce our reliance on places like Russia.” She added: “But [it’s also necessary] to make our building stock much more energy-efficient. The reason we have high rates of fuel poverty in the UK isn’t just about the commodity we burn, it’s the volume of it we burn because our energy efficiency rates here are much lower than other countries.” Households are facing an energy price cap rise this April, likely to amount to £2,000 for the average bill, and possibly a further rise to £2,400 in October. The cost-of-living crisis has embroiled the government in calls from its own backbenches to scale back or abandon measures to promote renewable energy and pay for home insulation for poor households, even though renewable energy is many times cheaper than gas and improving home insulation would cut bills for the most vulnerable. Bim Afolami, Conservative MP for Hitchin and Harpenden, called on his fellow Tories to get behind net zero policies, saying only “a very small number” of MPs were questioning them. “Let’s be clear, in terms of delivering net zero, there is no real option other than what the government has set out. It’s a shame that it needs saying, but everyone should rest assured that the bulk of the Conservative party and the government is four-square behind this, and committed to getting it done,” he said. Net zero is the commitment to reducing emissions by 100% so that the UK is producing no more carbon than it removes from the atmosphere. This will have to be achieved by reducing the amount of greenhouse gases created by activities such as industrial processes, power generation, transport and intensive agriculture, while removing emissions at the same time by capturing carbon or planting more trees. It is considered the minimum necessary to stop dangerous climate breakdown increasing the world’s temperature by more than 1.5 degrees celsius. However, there is a debate about how to get there, and how quickly, and how the costs will be spread. The current UK government wants to meet net zero by 2050, which will necessarily involve replacing gas boilers, moving to electric cars, improving insulation and lowering high-carbon consumption such as flights and meat-eating. Michael Grubb, professor of energy and climate change at University College London, said consumers were paying unnecessarily high prices for their electricity, as well as their gas, because of the way the UK energy market works. Electricity prices are set by the gas price, even though gas makes up only about 40% of electricity generation and renewable energy prices are far lower. He said the government could ease this by changing the way the UK energy market is structured, allowing for a “pool” of green energy contracts. Ministers should levy a windfall tax on fossil fuel producers, which have seen bumper profits from the global rise in gas prices and Russia’s constraint on European supplies, added Tessa Khan, founder of campaigning organisation Uplift. Taxes on fossil fuels in the UK were far too low, and tiny compared with those of other countries, at about $2 (£1.47) a barrel in the UK compared with more than $20 a barrel for Norway. Even at such low rates, thanks to favourable rules, some fossil fuels had received payouts from the government in recent years, rather than pay tax, she said. Oil and gas producers faced no extra costs but were reaping “windfall profits” from the gas price. “These profits are being privatised. The UK tax regime has made this the most profitable country in the world for oil and gas companies,” she said.",News/Environment,UK energy industry urges ministers to stick with net zero plan,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/20/net-zero-plan-uk-energy-industry
1/21/2022,"To leave feels unthinkable but to stay would be worse. Like ending a marriage or quitting a job you loved, abandoning one’s political tribe is never easy. But after months of agonising, the final break often brings with it a giddy feeling of relief. Odd, then, that there was so little sense of catharsis in Christian Wakeford’s “welcome to Labour” photocall with Keir Starmer, in which the defecting MP for Bury South looked like a man whose sleepless nights were just beginning. Perhaps he was worrying about his former colleagues scrolling furiously through their phones for old text messages with which to embarrass him. Or maybe he was anticipating a furious denunciation from the left, the minute they checked his voting record. (Young Labour swiftly obliged, tweeting that he shouldn’t be allowed to join the party, while Laura Pidcock – who lost what had been a safe seat for Labour in 2019 – tweeted that her former colleagues’ cheers for a defector swelling their ranks were a “deep insult to all of those fighting this disgraceful government”.)  Wakeford’s personal journey is certainly harder to follow than some. Quentin Davies, who crossed the floor to Labour in 2007, was a passionate pro-European exasperated by his leader’s flirtation with Euroscepticism. Shaun Woodward, the suave millionaire Tory who defected to Labour in 1999, did so after being fired from the Tory frontbench for his support for gay rights (and, many years later, came out as gay himself). Their stories made instinctive emotional sense. Wakeford, meanwhile, says he has wrestled for months with his unease at Conservative decisions on issues such as free school meals and the universal credit cut. But if so, why not rebel? Nor is it lost on either side that he had a paper-thin majority in Bury South, a seat he won only after the outgoing Labour-turned-independent MP, Ivan Lewis, urged constituents to vote Conservative in protest against antisemitism in the Labour party. For many on the left, welcoming him aboard while continuing to deny Jeremy Corbyn the whip just rubs salt into their wounds. Yet welcomed he must be, albeit with a silent prayer that due diligence was done first, and that’s not the worst of it. They’re going to have to take at least part of his advice, too. Wakeford’s defection has spooked his colleagues into briefly suspending their plotting against Boris Johnson, partly for practical reasons – if there was one spy in the rebel camp, then there might be others, just waiting for their moment to decamp to Labour and take all the party’s secrets with them – but also for more emotional ones. Watching one of their own choose a new party over a new leader as the best way out of the current mess was a brutal reminder that voters could easily do the same, coming as it did just as Theresa May’s former pollster James Johnson released polling giving Labour an 11-point lead in the so-called “red wall” seats captured by the Tories in 2019. It’s not Wakeford himself that matters but all the other Wakefords: the countless Conservative voters who share his stirrings of unease, aren’t yet sure what to do about it and are watching closely now. The last thing they need to see is a Labour party recoiling in disgust at the very idea that such people might be attracted to them. For that fat Labour poll lead hides a large pool of formerly Conservative voters who have shifted only as far as the “don’t know” column, where they’re waiting to see what happens next. Starmer’s job now is to seal the deal with these hovering voters before a punch-drunk government, which is willing to do whatever it takes to get them back, has time to scrape itself off the floor. If parts of the Labour movement can’t conceal their distaste for that project, then they have forgotten what politics is for. To the horror of some who backed Starmer for leader and the delight of others, last autumn he came off the fence on which he has been sitting since the leadership contest and landed, with a thud, on the side of doing what it takes to win. The playbook is familiar to anyone old enough to remember pre-Corbyn Labour – speeches on patriotism, claims to be “the party of business” – but this isn’t 1997 all over again. Many of the Conservative voters Starmer needs to win over aren’t alien to Labour traditions; rather, they are its tradition. They’re people who voted Labour all their lives before taking a punt on Boris Johnson and regretting it. Tales of boozing through lockdown made them feel taken for fools, and Labour’s task is to connect that anger, which crosses party lines, to an economic argument that resonates equally widely but moves the battle on to Johnson’s likely successors. In a week when inflation topped 5%, that no longer looks impossible. In talks before he defected, Wakeford reportedly advised Starmer to focus on rocketing energy bills, telling him that “we’ve got nothing” in response. Here, political necessity marries happily with gut Labour instincts. Soaring food and heating costs will force the poorest into unimaginably dire straits; who on the left isn’t incensed by that? But higher heating bills will also be keenly felt by pensioners on fixed incomes, businesses at a fragile point of post-pandemic recovery and ordinary families who were managing until the price of everything started going through the roof. So where is the chancellor? For weeks, Rishi Sunak has sidestepped all the scandal by piously insisted he’s just getting on with the day job. What has he got to show for it? Where’s the plan to soften the blow everyone knows is coming this spring, when soaring energy bills meet national insurance rises? Rachel Reeves, his Labour shadow, has been weeks ahead of him with detailed proposals. Winning over former Tory voters won’t always be this easy. Obviously there are painful conversations to come, on issues that threaten to split the Labour party all over again. But right now a government waiting for Sue Gray to put it out of its misery is in no fit state to set the agenda and Labour has a priceless chance to show its concerns are the country’s. If it throws that away in favour of yet more glorious infighting, then frankly it deserves to lose.

1/21/2022,"Álvaro Cervera had the look. He also had the T-shirts, the slogan and even the sign, a symbol all of his own. Not for him a bat beamed across the sky but a pair of stylised yellow specs, like some sort of short-sighted superman. Which he kind of was and always will be now, even for those who accepted it was time to let go: a cult figure in Cádiz, city of carnival and comedy. This great counter-cultural anti-hero who changed them and let them change him too, if maybe not quite enough in the end. ‘Mr Glasses’, Salvi Sánchez called him. Salvi knew what he had done, they all did. Born in the province, across the bay in Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Salvi had been at Cádiz when Cervera turned up as an unknown and unlikely coach in April 2016 and he was still there when he left last week, sacked after six years and bidding farewell to appreciative applause. Back then, Cádiz were in the Second Division B, Spain’s 80-team, regionalised, third-to-seventh division, and on the edge of the abyss; by the time he had gone, they had been promoted twice and were a top-flight team, having returned at last in 2020.  Así se despide un hombre que es historia viva del #CadizCF.Se despide Álvaro Cervera, con todo el cariño gaditano.Tremendo@ElGolazoDeGol pic.twitter.com/FKn0bCqIY6 Cervera always insisted he wouldn’t be remembered like Mágico González, the forward they were as fond of for sleeping in and sitting on the beach strumming his guitar as for scoring goals. In a place with a reputation for silliness and fun, where the football team supposedly fit that ideal too and fans pride themselves on being a little different, blowing kisses rather than hurling insults at opponents, he was unapologetically practical, a defensive coach who celebrated being more boring than bohemian, a prophet of parking the bus. He was also wrong, as it turned out. Even when his superpowers waned, Cervera’s popularity didn’t. He had taken Cádiz back to the first division after 15 years. Within three months, they had beaten Athletic, Madrid and Barcelona, the three teams who have only ever been there. He is, the club’s president said, the best manager in their history, the achievement too huge and the gratitude too great to get hung up on aesthetics. On the pitch anyway. Because if there was a sort of joy taken in being so bloody-minded, something almost funny about the way they socked it to the man, off the pitch there was something about him too. When he turned up in bright yellow glasses, Cádiz colours, it worked somehow. Something in how the city reached him reached them. Even in his style there was a straight-talking humility that hit home. When he used the phrase “fight is non-negotiable”, it got printed on T-shirts that soon sold out. One fan called his house that – and found Cervera popping in to say hello. He was the club, breaking down in tears when they returned to primera. Everyone knew this wasn’t easy and hadn’t been easy on him. They also kind of knew they shouldn’t really be there. The problem was, they weren’t likely to be there much longer. Last year Cádiz survived surprisingly comfortably but the second season was always likely to be harder. Their enemies had got wise to them, which didn’t take much. “It worked last year, but teams watch a lot of videos,” said striker Álvaro Negredo. Their signings have not had a particularly significant impact. Beaten 2-0 at Osasuna, Cádiz ended week 20 second bottom, three points from safety. They hadn’t won in nine games and had only two wins all season. Something was broken, between president and coach particularly, while defender Juan Cala understandably sounded like a man who feared they had already given up, relegation inevitable now. Talking of the need to “swim and swim, even if we die on the shore”, “to pull together, even if the boat is sinking”, he insisted: “No one escapes the fire.” Not even Cervera, and he knew that better than anyone. “We won’t survive like this,” he said after the Osasuna game, “salvation is possible but a lot has to change, and you could think of me in that too.” The following day he was sacked. The day after, Sergio Fernández was introduced as his replacement, arriving on a mission to keep them in the division. On a mission to give them the ball back too. It wasn’t just that results were bad; it was that even good ones might no longer be enough. When they drew 0-0 at Madrid recently, it was described by full-back Carlos Akapo as pure Cervera. But while that felt good, it was still only a point at a time when they need wins, and only lasted seven days. The style that had served them started to divide not bind. When he was sacked, Alex Fernández was one of many players calling him “a father”, but the fun had gone. Cervera, though, clung even tighter to the way they were, doubling down on his discourse to the point where it felt deliberate. Asked if Cervera had been “asking to be sacked”, the president said no, but there was something in how he spoke that seemed that way. He talked about how the more they tried to do, the worse they were, how he didn’t want the ball. There had been a perverse pleasure in that message before; now, it sounded like a self-parody. At times, the tone felt taunting, challenging. For players, it didn’t exactly feel like faith in them. The weight grew. “We’re a long way from our target and there’s a sadness about the team,” the president Vizcaíno said. Which is why Cervera was sitting there behind a picture of his specs and his hashtag – #LLNSN, fight is non-negotiable – last week, a shirt listing his achievements alongside him. “Gracias Álvaro” was written across the shoulders, the glasses symbol beneath. “I never imagined that I would come here at 50 and find a place that would change me so much,” he said, “but now I have a family that is waiting for me.” He closed by reciting a line from the club’s unofficial anthem, a pasodoble from the 1998 carnival called Me Han Dicho Que El Amarillo. “Long live Cádiz, long live cadistas, long live their bollocks!” he said, slapping the desk and standing to leave for the last time. Fans were furious, audible outside the ground. A banner declared Cervera the best manager in their history and they were sure the blame lay with Vizcaíno instead. A week on, at Cádiz’s first league game under Sergio against his former club Espanyol on Tuesday night, some called for the president to resign and chanted Cervera’s name. They owed him so much, after all. And it wasn’t like things were getting better, at least to begin with. Cádiz timid, inhibited, second to every ball: a team that looked beyond help. Espanyol were one-up and should have ended it. But at half-time, something shifted. “We had nothing to lose,” Negredo said afterwards. “Sergio told us to take the ‘rucksack’ off our shoulders, that we have to enjoy this.” Cádiz took control and took the ball. Negredo scored an equaliser and had two ruled out by VAR – “it’s been a long time since I had so many chances,” he said – and around the ground something shifted, a hint of hope, and then a chant. “Yes, we can,” it ran. They almost could too. In the 91st minute, Iván Alejo escaped up the right, and slipped a superb finish through Diego López’s legs to put them ahead. The place went wild, and no wonder: they had not been in a position like this for as long as anyone could remember, on the verge of a first home win of the season to take them within a point of salvation. Hope reappeared. All they had to do was hang on, defend one last throw of the dice and the ball, and they could experience something they hadn’t experienced for too long. They didn’t. The throw was taken on 94.58, the ball hit their net on 95.02, Raúl de Tomas heading in and skidding to his knees in celebration while Cádiz’s players fell to theirs. “It hurts,” Sergio said. It wasn’t just the points, how they were caught or that Cádiz had not won at home all season, or since the ground’s name had been forcibly changed from the Carranza to the Nuevo Mirandilla, a curse that needed lifting. It was worse: when at last Cervera had brought Cádiz back, they did so without their supporters; when the supporters came back, the team stopped winning. The fans had not been there to see a first division win since May 2006.

1/21/2022,"My brother, Simon Foxley, who has died aged 64 of circulatory problems, was an accomplished musician, conductor, teacher, arranger and composer. He was born in Harrow, north-west London, the son of Doreen (nee Hartle), a nurse specialising in anaesthetics, and Ray (Raymond) Foxley, a professional jazz pianist. He grew up in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, and began playing the piano at a young age, encouraged by his father. At North Bromsgrove high school Simon also took up the French horn and played in the school and county youth orchestras.  In the early 1970s along with three friends he formed the band Hunkpapa. They played a diverse set list at local gigs in and around Birmingham while still at school, earning a commendation in a competition from Melody Maker. Simon went on to study music at the University of Manchester, graduating in 1978. During his time there he established himself as a conductor and began his lifelong interest in contemporary classical music. After graduating he worked as a freelance conductor, pianist and piano teacher in Manchester before moving to London in 1980, where he was a senior music tutor with the Inner London Education Authority for 10 years. From 1990 to 1996 he was education and community officer for the Spitalfields festival and was a project coordinator for the London Arts Board (1994-95), and the Women’s Playhouse Trust (1995-96). Simon was also music director for Contemporary Music-Making for Amateurs (Coma) from its inception in 1992. In 1994 he became head of the Centre for Young Musicians in Hackney. He stopped working in 2006 but continued to write music, embracing new music technology as he came across it. In 2020, he completed a large-scale piece for violin and electronics called The Day’s Deep Midnight. The violin would be accompanied by a mixture of bells, clocks and birdsong. It is intricate and strikingly original. He possessed an enormous collection of CDs, minidiscs and other recorded music; a fiercely guarded hi-fi system, including a Linn turntable whose virtues he never tired of extolling; and a sophisticated home recording studio. He also played bridge, was a devoted supporter of Manchester United and read the Guardian daily. Simon believed that making music was a life-enhancing experience that should be available to everyone, regardless of age, experience, or financial circumstances. His passion for this goal, along with his flowing mane of hair, will remain a lasting memory for those who knew him. Simon is survived by his sisters, Kate and me.

1/21/2022,"“Iwant it to be big,” says Jade Atkin of the Cardiff Met Archers. “I want people to be saying: ‘you’re on TV, we want to watch you’ and I want people to want to come and I want the sport to do well. We all want the sport to do well. And to be honest, I think that can happen.” The sport is wheelchair basketball and Atkin, a Great Britain international, is going to be part of a revolution. When the Women’s Premier League taps off for the first time this weekend it will not just create a new professional league in women’s sport, it will be the first ever in women’s parasport in the UK. Four teams – Worcester Wolves, Loughborough Lightning, East London Phoenix and the Archers - will compete for the title and the BBC is committed to showing eight games live, including the final in May.  “Whenever you see sport on the TV it’s always the men, and always the men making all the money,” says the American Curran Brown, who will play for the Phoenix. “Women as a whole struggle to make a name for themselves in the sporting world and when you put disability with it it’s even lower, it’s not represented at all. I think we have two barriers on top of each other. So I think this is a great beginning, to show what we represent and that we can play toughly as well.” Wheelchair basketball was the third most watched sport during Channel 4’s Paralympics coverage last year. It’s fast, technical, tactical and easy for newcomers to understand. Supported by a network of 200 clubs and community organisations across the country the British Wheelchair Basketball Women’s Premier League (or BWBWPL for shorter) starts from strong foundations and 1,000 tickets have been sold for Saturday’s opener in Worcester between the Wolves and the Lightning. The BWBWPL is breaking sporting ground, not just in itself as a competition but by aiming to shift perceptions more broadly. Speak to any Paralympian and they say that the next challenge for parasport is to take the attention and passion that alights on the Games every four years and bring it back into domestic competition all year round. This is a chicken and egg situation to an extent, with the contribution of broadcasters a crucial component but regular compelling competition a pre-requisite too. Women’s wheelchair basketball now aspires to provide that offering. Beaming parasport (and, as Brown observes, women’s sport too) into the nation’s homes then provides other opportunities. “This is hugely significant in getting disability representation out there,” says Lisa Pearce, the CEO of British Wheelchair Basketball, “and also to help more disabled people across the country and around the world see how incredible this sport is and how great it is to get involved in sport and physical activity.” Seven in every 10 people who died from Covid in the UK to this point have been registered disabled, but the pandemic has also brought a disproportionate impact on activity levels of people with disabilities more broadly. “It’s completely unacceptable,” says Pearce, “and we need to create more opportunities for disabled people to have sporting and physical activity opportunities. We need to create a platform to have wider conversations too and sport, wheelchair basketball in this instance, offers a great opportunity to have a wider societal discussion about why there are so many systematic issues with disability in this country.” The opportunities for disabled people to engage in sport are limited and so to is the awareness. Atkin says she did not know about wheelchair basketball herself until a few years ago. At that time she was not disabled herself, but she accompanied her sister as she discovered the sport, forming an enthusiasm of her own. When Atkin later developed the same condition as her sister, a form of hereditary spastic paraplegia, she continued to pursue that passion. Now Atkin can dream of being someone who people want to watch on TV, and can seek to inspire both other young women and other people with disabilities. Among that audience may be the parasport champions of tomorrow. More importantly, however, there may be more people who simply find the opportunity to fall in love with the sport as Atkin has. “It’s so much fun”, she says. “Every time I play whether it’s internationally or national league [a mixed sex competition], wherever I play, I play for fun. I play for fun no matter what and that won’t change, it will never change. I love basketball.” To find out more about the BWBWPL and to buy tickets, go to www.britishwheelchairbasketball.co.uk/womens-premier-league",Sport/Sport,Welcome to Britain’s newest televised pro league: wheelchair basketball,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/20/welcome-to-britains-newest-televised-womens-pro-league-wheelchair-basketball
1/21/2022,"The UK government has rejected plans from a leading Tory donor to build a controversial £1.2bn electricity and internet cable running from the UK to France. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, has refused to grant consent to Aquind Energy for the project, which has provoked fierce opposition over national security and environmental concerns from MPs and campaigners in the UK and France.  Aquind applied more than two years ago for permission to run the giant subsea cable from near Dieppe to Portsmouth. It would have carried one of Europe’s biggest internet data links and enough electricity to meet almost 5% of the UK’s annual demand. After multiple delays, Kwarteng refused the application on Thursday, in what campaigners have described as a “victory” for Portsmouth residents. The business secretary said he was unable to conclude that the benefits of the proposed development would outweigh its adverse impacts on the local area. Penny Mordaunt, the Conservative MP for Portsmouth North and a former defence secretary, had led calls against the project, saying it was not helpful to the UK’s energy security. She had raised concerns France could cut the supply in any future dispute. Welcoming Kwarteng’s decision, she said: “If you stand up for what you believe in and you fight for it you can actually change things”. Together, we stopped Aquind.Thank you Portsmouth. pic.twitter.com/V4Ma1QWh6j The cross-Channel cable also faced steady criticism from Portsmouth city council, which raised almost £250,000 to oppose the venture, saying the project could severely disrupt local traffic and threaten parts of the South Downs national park. Concerns were raised in parliament as well as in the Guardian’s Pandora Papers investigation into the source of the company’s finances and its close links government ministers. Aquind and one of its directors have made multiple donations to the Conservative party. A source close to Kwarteng said the application was refused consent “on planning grounds alone”. Lawyers for Aquind and its owners have previously denied any wrongdoing, said they operated in an open and transparent manner and that their donations were “entirely lawful, properly declared and have not been made in return for any special treatment”. Aquind is co-owned by Alexander Temerko, a friend of Boris Johnson. At least £1.3m has been donated to the Conservatives by Temerko, who was born in Soviet Ukraine, and the companies he is connected to, including Aquind. The donations were made to at least eight ministers and MPs including the former business secretary Alok Sharma and Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary and former security minister. The junior minister and peer Martin Callanan is a former director of Aquind, while fellow House of Lords member James Wharton, recently appointed as head of the universities watchdog, has disclosed that his consultancy received fees from Aquind. Aquind has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its financial disclosures or political donations. Stephen Morgan, the Labour MP for Porstmouth South, said the decision to reject the application was “a victory for the people of Portsmouth over years of uncertainty”. Morgan paid tribute “to local campaigners who have helped me lead our city’s united opposition”, adding: “Without our efforts, this would not have been possible. Together, we have stopped Aquind,.” A spokesperson for Aquind said the company was “naturally disappointed” that its application was refused and that it would consider the decision and whether a legal challenge was worth pursuing. they said. “We believe our application for a development consent order to be accurate and robust, and it has met all the requirements.”",News/Business,Kwasi Kwarteng rejects Tory donor’s plan for £1.2bn subsea cable,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/20/kwasi-kwarteng-rejects-tory-donors-plan-for-12bn-subsea-cable-aquind-energy
1/21/2022,"My aunt, Susan Waller Thomas, who has died of cancer aged 80, was an inspiring and dedicated teacher, councillor, lord mayor and high sheriff in Swansea and West Glamorgan. She was compassionate and fiercely intelligent and had a deep belief in the power of advocacy to change lives and create opportunities. Born in Stamford, Lincolnshire, Susan was the daughter of Mary (nee Peasgood) and Freddie Amoore, an RAF engineer. Her schooldays in Lincolnshire she described as appallingly awful, and she went on to dedicate many years of her life to young people and to improving the experience that they would have of education and wider society. She always listened to what people had to say and never dismissed the concerns of others.  Sue studied psychology and English at Liverpool University, graduating in 1963. At Liverpool she met Derek Waller, a mathematician. After their marriage in 1964, they moved to south Wales, where Derek became a lecturer in mathematics at University College of Swansea (later Swansea University). They intended to stay for only two years but instead built their lives in Wales. Sue taught English at Gowerton girls’ grammar school, at West Glamorgan Institute and Gorseinon College. In 1978, Derek died of leukaemia aged 37, leaving Sue to parent their three young children – which she did with immense devotion and courage. Sue also had an extraordinary commitment to community and became actively involved in Swansea’s services for refugees from the Vietnam war. She was an English teacher and advocate to Vietnamese refugee families, many of whom became lifelong friends. In the early 1980s she was elected a Liberal Democrat councillor for Newton ward on Swansea council. After many years as a councillor, Sue served as lord mayor of Swansea in 2007, and as high sheriff of West Glamorgan in 2011. In 2008 Sue married Alan Thomas, an academic at Swansea University. Their home was a place of delicious dinners for family and friends, barbecues and Easter egg hunts. She continued to support causes that were dear to her, including charities for young carers, and sponsoring Guide Dogs for the Blind. She was honorary chair of the Gower Badgers cricket club.

1/21/2022,"Beleaguered pubs and restaurants are reporting early signs of a recovery in trade, fuelling hope that pent-up demand from a dismal Christmas for the sector is about to be unleashed. Hospitality bosses told the Guardian that takings have picked up pace lately and that the easing of Plan B Covid restrictions – including the dropping of work-from-home guidance – could further bolster the recovery.  As research revealed that the UK lost more than 8,000 licensed premises in 2021 – the equivalent of 13 a day – pub bosses warned the industry was not out of the woods yet and called on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to extend support for the sector. Early signs of recovery included a stock market update from Revolution Bars, which has 67 venues. It said many of the office parties that were cancelled in December due to concerns about Omicron had been rebooked for early 2022. The number of pub-goers is on the rise, according to Chris Jowsey, the chief executive of 1000-strong Admiral Taverns chain, although he called for further Treasury support to help take advantage of higher footfall. “There is some pent-up demand because so much of Christmas was cancelled,” he said. “Even last week, we saw signs of people starting to go back to the local, and our trading over last weekend was decent.” However, he called on Sunak to extend the lower, temporary 12.5% rate of VAT for hospitality businesses, and bring forward budget plans to reduce duty on draught beer, scheduled for 2023. Restrictions on socialising forced pubs, restaurants and hotels to close, or drastically reduce capacity, during large parts of 2020 and 2021. Figures from the industry analysts AlixPartners, released on Thursday, showed a net loss of 8,228 hospitality venues, a 7% decline, during 2021. The group echoed calls for further government support, saying any recovery could be choked off by “rapidly rising food and energy costs, staff shortages and supply problems”. While the recovery remains fragile, the figures showed an apparent rebound in the final quarter of 2021, with a 1.6% increase in the total number of licensed premises between October and December, by 1,672 to 106,880. The rise was partly led by nightclubs, with numbers increasing by 3.1%, as they enjoyed the first sustained period of being allowed to open. Growth in city centre venues was particularly strong, with the number of Edinburgh premises up 3.3%, Leeds up 3.9% and Liverpool leading the way on 4.4%. A survey by the CGA data consultancy suggested a third of people were planning to increase the frequency of their evenings out. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of the trade body UK Hospitality, said the sector was hoping for renewed momentum from the easing of restrictions, in particular the work-from-home guidance. “Now that’s being lifted, that will accelerate those events and activities that are going on. Consumer demand is out there, there’s an appetite to get back out and if we can get through the next few months I’ve no doubt the industry can look forward to a successful recovery from Easter onwards.”",News/Business,UK hospitality shows signs of recovery after Omicron-hit Christmas,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/20/hospitality-showing-early-signs-of-recovery-in-uk-after-omicron-hit-christmas
1/21/2022,"I read Nesrine Malik’s article (For the Tory party, Boris Johnson is a blip not a crisis, 17 January) and I sincerely hope that she turns out to be wrong for all our sakes, because so many in this country cannot afford yet another Tory government. I hear Neil Kinnock’s warning “not to be young, not to fall ill, not to grow old”, on a continuous loop in my head at the moment. Surely, I keep telling myself, when people witness first-hand the irreparable damage done to the NHS and the care sector, they will not vote the Conservatives in again. Surely people will realise that the Tories’ laissez-faire attitude to market forces dictating the way our public utilities are run, and the bleak prospect of inflation creating a perfect storm for millions, is not the way forward.  I fear that many want some kind of return to their rose-tinted memories of the Thatcher years. Having grown up in the Thatcher years on the outskirts of Manchester, that thought petrifies me. Because those years are ingrained in my memory – when it was made painfully clear that if you didn’t have money, your value as a person was minimal. Do we really wish that on our children and grandchildren, for them to feel that unless they earn a good living they are a burden on society? If that is what people believe would improve our lot, they are sorely mistaken.Sue HardmanWoodbridge, Suffolk  Nesrine Malik is spot-on regarding Boris Johnson’s position vis-a-vis new Tory voters in the “red wall” constituencies. It reminds me of Prof Stuart Hall’s commentary on how Margaret Thatcher constructed a new ultra-rightwing hegemonic consensus, supported by most of the national press, which began the dismantling of the Keynesian “mixed economy”, and replaced it with market fundamentalism, outsourcing, privatisation and the financial deregulation that has wrecked our society and culminated in the catastrophes of austerity and Brexit. Thatcher managed to capture older and working-class voters with the discounted sale of council houses and the slashing of social security for those deemed undeserving. Boris Johnson’s perceived strength with early vaccination, culture war policies and Brexit has maintained his popularity among new Tory voters, despite the long list of his lethal pandemic failures, mendacity and abuse of public office. Labour ought to be 20 points in front. Keir Starmer has got no room for complacency and needs to craft a pro-European, vote-reforming, green alliance with centre-left parties to finally end Conservative electoral dictatorships and Britain’s decades-long rightwing folly.Philip WoodKidlington, Oxfordshire  I smiled at Nesrine Malik’s reference to people’s perception of Boris Johnson as a pantomime villain. He grasps the electorate’s attention and media headlines by dint of his incompetent, crass and inept behaviour. Meanwhile, his government introduces legislation that attacks the very tenets of our democracy – restricting the right to protest, curtailing the effectiveness and independence of the country’s major broadcaster, increasing the privatisation of the NHS, restricting our right to vote and so much more. Let’s not get distracted by Johnson’s pantomime behaviour. Let’s keep our focus on the real threats to our future democracy, because these threats will endure whether or not Johnson remains.Peter RiddleWirksworth, Derbyshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
