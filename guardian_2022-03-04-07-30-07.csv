3/4/2022,"There was no seismic upset at Goodison Park but no FA Cup rout or humiliation either. Boreham Wood, bidding to become only the second non-league club to reach the quarter-finals, made life extremely difficult for Everton before Premier League superiority told. Salomon Rondón struck twice in the second half to take Frank Lampard’s team into a last eight meeting away at Crystal Palace. They will need to improve significantly on this display to reach the semi-finals at Wembley but the night belonged to Luke Garrard and his accomplished side. The Hertfordshire club defended expertly throughout and underlined why they are firmly in pursuit of promotion to the Football League this season. Everton have been a class act since drawing the non-league side, Garrard had said, with the Premier League club paying for their visitors’ specially commissioned fifth-round kit, taking care of travel arrangements and sorting their accommodation. The same was true of Everton’s moving anti-war statement prior to kick off too. Ukraine international Vitalii Mykolenko, the club’s January signing from Dynamo Kyiv, was named captain for the night by Lampard. He led out an Everton team draped in Ukraine flags, as were the players of Boreham Wood, and as the teams emerged on to the pitch the traditional pre-match strains of Z-Cars were replaced by John Lennon’s Imagine. Both sets of players gathered behind a blue and yellow banner carrying a hopeful, poignant line from the song. “Imagine all the people, Sharing all the world.” Outside, all MegaFon branding had been removed from the stadium after the suspension of Everton’s sponsorship deals with Russian companies backed by Alisher Usmanov, the oligarch close to the club’s majority shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, and who has been sanctioned by the EU and the UK. The sombre opening gave way to a fiercely committed display from Boreham Wood and palpable frustration in the Everton ranks as a result. The National League promotion chasers had started their FA Cup story with a 1-0 win at Barnet in the fourth qualifying round on 16 October. Eastleigh, St Albans City, AFC Wimbledon and Bournemouth had also fallen to Garrard’s team en route to a prestigious date at Goodison, where their manager looked genuinely taken aback by the surroundings before kick-off. Garrard took a good look around the entire stadium, opening his arms at the size of the Main Stand looming above him, and accepted well-wishes from Everton’s backroom staff and supporters during the warm-up. But he and his team were not over-awed. Boreham Wood pressed immediately with a three-man forward line and caused several palpitations in the Gwladys Street end at Everton’s awkward attempts to escape. They were soon forced into a deep block, with a five-man defence closely protected by three in central midfield, and managed to contain their Premier League hosts with some comfort. Everton’s opening chance fell to Mykolenko, and what a fleeting release it would have been for the Ukrainian had he scored his first goal for the club on his fourth appearance. Receiving Abdoulaye Doucouré’s pass on the left, the 22-year-old connected cleanly with his strike but Taye Ashby-Hammond pushed clear. The Boreham Wood goalkeeper also denied Anthony Gordon’s dipping attempt from the corner of the penalty area but that was the full extent of his workload in the first half. Everton lacked guile to unlock the compact unit in front of them. When the hosts did create space out wide the quality of their deliveries was consistently poor, from the right particularly. There was a brief stoppage in play as medics attended to a fan who had fallen ill in the Bullens Road Stand. Boreham Wood departed to a raucous ovation from their fans, and Everton to grumbles, when the half-time whistle sounded with the contest goalless moments later. Lampard had seen enough, and paid the non-league side the compliment of introducing Richarlison alongside Rondón for the second half. The Brazil international replaced Nathan Patterson, who has had to be patient for his debut since arriving from Rangers in January and could count himself unfortunate to be withdrawn. But the decision was tactical, and vindicated when Everton eventually ended the stalemate. Rondón squandered an excellent chance when Jonjoe Kenny, switched to right back following Patterson’s substitution and Lampard’s move to a 4-4-2, swept an inviting cross over Connor Stevens early in the second half. Rondon, arriving in behind, headed dreadfully over from six yards out. The Venezuela striker atoned minutes later, however, after more good work by Kenny. Receiving Allan’s pass in space, the full back sent a fine first time cross towards the near post where Rondon held off David Stephens to sweep a finish beyond Ashby-Hammond. Richarlison had a goal disallowed for handball by VAR after Adrian Clifton headed Gordon’s cross into the Brazilian’s face, the ball then touching his arm before crossing the line, but Rondon brought Everton the comfort of a second late on. Andros Townsend collected Gordon’s short corner and floated a cross to the far post where the centre-forward powered a header beyond Ashby-Hammond, the ball crossing the line before the keeper clawed it away.",Sport/Football,Salomón Rondón doubles up to send Everton past battling Boreham Wood,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/03/salomon-rondon-doubles-up-to-send-everton-past-battling-boreham-wood
3/4/2022,"More than 500 international students are trapped in Sumy, a town 40km from Ukraine’s northeast border which has been battered by days of shelling by Russian forces. Most of the students are Nigerian, while others are from Ghana, Ethiopia, Angola, Tanzania, Rwanda, Ireland, India, Lebanon and Turkey. They have all suddenly found themselves stranded in a war zone. Trains and buses have stopped running; roads and bridges out of the city have been destroyed and fighting has been reported in the city’s streets. The students have remained in five hostel buildings since the Russian invasion began last week, after advice from their university to stay behind – even as many Ukrainian students fled. Oluwaseun Adefemi, a Nigerian medical student who arrived in Sumy in January, said that food and water supplies were already running low and it was no longer safe to head to local stores. “We are hearing blasts every day. We have to run into our bunkers each time. Yesterday we heard the blasts at six or seven in the morning. When we hear them, we run to the basement – that’s our makeshift bunker,” he said, speaking by telephone late on Wednesday. “We are running out of food, we’re running out of water. What we have now is mainly soda water,” Adefemi said. While the conflict has so far mainly focused on the outskirts of the city, fears are rising that troops may soon enter the city. Adefami said that many of the students felt let down by the university. “We expected that the school would give us the best information. They told us to stay in our hostel, to stock and buy food that we’d need for the days ahead. If we’d have known we’d have gone to neighbouring cities – but now we are stuck.” Before the conflict, thousands of international students were studying in Ukraine, drawn by low fees and living costs and the legacy of close ties between the Soviet Union and developing countries, especially in Africa. Some students said they had initially stayed because they feared they would have to retake classes and pay further tuition and accommodation fees if they left. Racheal Diyaolu, a 19-year-old medical student from Carlow, is one of several Irish students in the group. When she arrived in Ukraine in November she was reassured by tutors that Russian threats of invasion were just that. She said she was trying to stay positive. “We are taking each day as it comes and just hoping the situation resolves itself,” she said. “There is not much more you can do.” While the sounds of “bangs and ammunition” surround them, the students have been told that Sumy remains under Ukrainian control, she said. “It’s up and down. We are safe for the time being, but it can get scary at times,” she said. In phone calls last week and again on Wednesday, Ireland’s department for foreign affairs had advised her to stay put for the moment, she said. Diyaolu was more concerned for her mother back in Ireland, she said. “She is very very worried. It is not an easy thing for any mother to go through but I just hope I will be home soon”. ""We are just trying to stay positive.""A 19-year-old medical student from Carlow who is stranded in the Ukrainian city of Sumy has provided an insight into her life in the war-torn country. Racheal Diyaolu has been confined to her student accommodation since the conflict began. pic.twitter.com/77O7yzaDs6 Train and bus services out of Sumy are suspended and, while the conflict has so far mainly focused on the outskirts of the city, fears are rising that troops may soon enter the city. Some drivers in Sumy have offered to take students to other regions, charging as much as 1,600 dollars to drive them to Poltava, 175km south of Sumy. But many students cannot afford such inflated fees. Foreign citizens of colour, mainly students from Africa and Asia, have faced discrimination and violence as they’ve attempted to flee Ukraine. In response to outrage at reported abuse by Ukrainian border officials, security forces and local groups, the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba said yesterday an emergency hotline had been setup for African, Asian and other students wishing to leave Ukraine. “We are working intensively to ensure their safety & speed up their passage. Russia must stop its aggression which affects us all,” he said. A spokesperson for Ireland’s government said “Irish citizens currently in Ukraine are advised to shelter in a secure place” adding they should only consider leaving “if they judge it safe to do so”. Nigeria’s government said it was working on securing safe passage for its students from Russia, through appeals made by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) UN agencies, but that progress was slow. Nearby churches are also involved in trying to supply food to the students, yet packages have grown less frequent as the conflict has appeared more intense. Toluwalase Kolapo-Bello, a medical student from Lagos, has been in Sumy for four years and said that much of Sumy was gripped with fear. “We’ve been surrounded by Russian troops and soldiers for days now, crying out for help. “We are just ordinary students who came here to get a degree, to further our education and our career. We just want to go home and see our families.”",News/World news,Sumy: more than 500 international students trapped in Ukrainian town battered by shelling,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/sumy-more-than-500-international-students-trapped-in-ukrainian-town-battered-by-shelling
3/4/2022,"Leeds Rhinos secured their first victory of the season at the fourth attempt, beating a Wakefield side who remain without a win in 2022. There were numerous individual displays of note for Richard Agar’s side, who led 30-0 at half-time in appalling conditions and were able to ease off the gas somewhat in the second half. In the week Shaun Wane named his latest England training squad, Ash Handley provided a clear reminder of his ability with a wonderful hat-trick. Encouragingly for Wane there were also standout displays from young English talent including Morgan Gannon and Harry Newman but Handley, who was perhaps surprisingly left out by Wane, showed his international potential here. After struggling in their opening three outings of the season, this was much more like it from Leeds, with a near-faultless performance in the first half likely of great satisfaction for Agar. For Wakefield, however, it was a frustrating night for a side who are likely to be in the mix to avoid relegation. Despite commendable effort in the second half the result was decided before the interval, with Trinity’s unforgivable first-half defending contributing to their downfall. The early season performances of these sides had suggested Wakefield were closer to their first win of the season than Leeds. But by half-time, the result had been put beyond doubt by the visitors after a completely one-sided and ruthless first half in which Trinity could have few complaints about the scoreline. The writing was on the wall as early as the fourth minute, when David Fusitu’a barged over for his first Super League try. By the midway point of the half, Leeds had opened up an 18-point lead that was already beginning to look unassailable. Slick handling led to Gannon crossing for their second try before Newman marked his first appearance of the season with a fine finish. Rhyse Martin added a penalty to make it 18-0 and leave Wakefield, who were offering little in the way of a response with the ball, looking lacklustre at best. The hosts were without a string of frontline backs, forcing them to field two forwards in the centres. They looked disjointed without question and after Lewis Murphy, on his debut on the wing, spilled a towering Blake Austin kick, Liam Sutcliffe collected and gave Handley the opportunity to finish in the corner. Martin converted again, just as he did on the stroke of half-time when Handley cut through on the angle past a hapless Wakefield defensive line to make it 30-0. There was at least a semblance of respectability added to the scoreline by Wakefield after the break. Defensively, they were much more resolute, and they avoided the ignominy of losing without scoring when an error from Fusitu’a led to Matty Ashurst crossing for Trinity, but the momentum was soon back with Leeds. After Murphy made another unforced error inside his own half, Leeds laid the platform for Handley to complete his hat-trick in stunning fashion in the corner despite the attention of three Wakefield defenders. The hosts completed the scoring in the final moments with tries for Max Jowitt and Tom Johnstone, but the damage had long since been done.

3/4/2022,"Polls have closed in the Birmingham Erdington by-election, amid jitters among Labour campaigners that a low turnout could jeopardise the party’s hold on the seat. The byelection was triggered by the death of the Labour MP Jack Dromey, who had represented the constituency since 2010. It has been held by Labour since 1974: as long as it has existed in its current form. Dromey had a majority of 3,600 at the last election. Labour poured campaigners into the local area on Thursday on a concerted get-out-the-vote drive, as wet weather risked further depressing turnout in a seat where it has previously been low in past contests – making the result harder to predict. One activist said they had run out of potential voters to rally by 6.30pm, and were anxious about the result. Two Labour MPs campaigning in the seat said they thought they would hold it, however. The Conservatives made gains in the West Midlands in the 2019 general election, winning longstanding Labour seats including Birmingham Northfield, and Tom Watson’s former constituency of West Bromwich East. A Tory source said Boris Johnson’s party did not expect to win in Erdington, but hoped to maintain its 2019 vote share, which was 40% to Labour’s 50%. The elections expert Patrick English, of YouGov, said: “All signs point to what should be a comfortable hold for Starmer’s party tonight.” He highlighted the fact that when Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection to the Conservatives last May, they were trailing the Conservatives by about 10 points in the national polls, but have now been leading consistently for almost three months. The Conservatives’ poll lead has been obliterated after months of debilitating headlines over lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street, and there is little sign as yet that the prime minister’s handling of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is helping to restore his reputation in voters’ eyes. The party suffered the humiliating loss of the North Shropshire byelection to the Liberal Democrats in December, after the resignation of disgraced former MP Owen Paterson, and senior Tories are concerned they could see significant losses in forthcoming local elections. Labour’s candidate in Erdington, local nurse Paulette Hamilton, was embroiled in controversy this week when comments emerged from 2015 when she attended a meeting called “The Ballot or the Bullet – Does Your Vote Count?” about increasing minorities’ representation in politics. Hamilton said she was not sure “we will get what we really deserve in this country using the vote”. Labour said the remarks had been taken out of context. Hamilton brought up her five children in Erdington and has sat on Birmingham city council for 18 years. She returned to the NHS frontline during the pandemic. The Conservative candidate is another local councillor, Bobby Alden, the leader of the Conservative group on the council, who has contested Erdington unsuccessfully four times in the past.",News/Politics,Birmingham Erdington: low turnout has Labour anxious as polls close,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/03/birmingham-erdington-byelection-low-turnout-labour-anxious-polls-close
3/4/2022,"Taking on Ireland at Twickenham a week on Saturday will be a “step up” in the Six Nations for England, says the forwards coach, Richard Cockerill. After an opening defeat by Scotland and victories against Italy and Wales, Eddie Jones’s side are third in the table with two matches remaining. Andy Farrell’s Ireland sit second behind France, also with two wins out of three, but marginally ahead having scored three bonus points to England’s two. Ireland recorded an emphatic 57-6 victory against Italy last Sunday after the Azzurri were reduced to 13 men but their first-round fixture, a 29-7 demolition of Wales in Dublin, provides a more accurate reflection of the talent at Farrell’s disposal. Under the tutelage of the attack coach Mike Catt, Ireland aim to play a high-tempo attacking game in which their powerful forwards play a full part. “They’re a very good side, aren’t they?” Cockerill said on Thursday. “They play a really good style of rugby, very physical, the way they carry the ball and the way their forward pack go about their business. And their backs have been impressive. We’re looking forward to the game, but we know it’s going to be a step up from what we’ve played so far.” Cockerill is tasked with coordinating England’s pack against an accomplished Ireland front eight, although it emerged on Thursday that the increasingly influential Leinster prop Andrew Porter will miss the rest of the Six Nations with an ankle injury. According to Cockerill the set piece could decide the outcome of an encounter that, if England win, would set up a tournament “final” against France in Paris on 19 March. Ireland finish their campaign at home against Scotland on the same day, and are aiming to be in contention for the championship by first winning in south-west London. “Ireland are very good at their set piece and that’s going to be a real battle, both scrum and lineout,” Cockerill said. “That’s going to be where the game is probably won or lost. We know what they’re going to bring, and we aim to match that and make it a fierce contest.” England have front-row injury problems of their own, with Exeter’s Luke Cowan-Dickie ruled out for the rest of the tournament after damaging knee ligaments in the win against Wales. The hooker will potentially miss the rest of the domestic season, and Cockerill said: “Disappointed for himself and Exeter, and obviously ourselves. He’s a really important player to the team, a leader of the group as well, so it’s a bit of a blow.” In Jamie George, however, England have a more than adequate alternative, and Cockerill expects the Saracens hooker to prove his worth in the pivotal matches against Ireland and then France. “He will be key with his experience,” he said. “When you’re in big games and you get real pressure on your game, experience is the thing that holds it together, and Jamie will bring that in bucketloads.” Cockerill had upbeat injury news on the back-rower Tom Curry, who sustained a knock to the head against Wales, and the Exeter lock Jonny Hill, who has been sidelined since early January with an ankle stress fracture. “Tom’s going through normal return-to-play [concussion] protocols as any player would,” Cockerill said. “We expect him to come through that and be ready for training next week. Jonny Hill has taken full part in training both yesterday and today, so positive news on him … If he comes through training fully, with no reactions, there’s a good chance he’ll be available for selection.” A hamstring strain ruled the Sale centre Manu Tuilagi out of the Wales game at the last minute. Asked if he could recover in time to feature against France, Cockerill said: “Let’s see how he goes in the next couple of weeks. It’s a decision to be made at a different time.”",Sport/Sport,"Six Nations clash with Ireland a ‘step up’ for England, says Richard Cockerill",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/03/six-nations-clash-with-ireland-a-step-up-for-england-says-richard-cockerill
3/4/2022,"Like her 2012 memoir, A Natural Woman, this jukebox musical is bookended by Carole King putting on a concert. The show opens and closes at New York’s Carnegie Hall in the wake of her phenomenally successful 1971 album Tapestry and traces King’s journey into the spotlight as a solo artist, focusing on her songwriting partnership with her first husband, Gerry Goffin. Nikolai Foster’s touring production is staged with his customary elan and finds Molly-Grace Cutler in fine voice as a quirky and compassionate King. But the musical – which won Tony awards in New York in 2014 and Olivier awards in London the following year – shortchanges the singer-songwriter both in her personal and professional lives, never fully capturing her character or how she blazed a trail, on her own terms, through the industry. Douglas McGrath’s book begins by minimising King’s childhood – her younger brother, who was moved into a residence for disabled people, goes unmentioned while her father, a firefighter, is defined primarily as an adulterer. The story hurtles into her meeting with mogul Don Kirshner (portrayed as a jovial uncle by Garry Robson) and her teenage achievements seem breezy as she crafts pop songs at a time when, one medley reminds us, the charts were full of yakety-yak, stupid cupids and splish-splashing on a Saturday night. On the other side of Goffin and King’s cubicle in Kirshner’s hit factory is another songwriting couple, Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann, and the show captures their friendly rivalry as both duos pull an all-nighter to write a new song for Kirshner’s approval. Several songs are smartly used to reflect King’s changing circumstances: Some Kind of Wonderful marks the discovery that she’s pregnant and Up on the Roof alludes to Goffin’s turbulent childhood, though it could equally have mirrored King’s career-long search for private space in a noisy industry. Will You Love Me Tomorrow? comments not on the pair’s first night together but King’s fears of her husband’s infidelity; One Fine Day presents his eventual affair from both women’s perspective. Foster’s production, which cuts the original’s overture, has an attractively loose feel. Songs are often first heard in embryo form, followed by polished performances from the groups who recorded them. Within a giant mosaic frame, Frankie Bradshaw’s set features studios and writing booths but these busy anonymous settings also accentuate the lack of quiet intimacy in the script. In her song Goodbye Don’t Mean I’m Gone, King wrote of holding a baby in one hand and a pen in the other; her family life is never as convincingly evoked here as her job. Too often the script favours a quick gag over emotional depth. Tom Milner captures Goffin’s unpredictability but the book glosses over the severity of his mental illness, which resulted in electroshock therapy. Seren Sandham-Davies is a brassy Cynthia, even before picking up her trumpet, and Jos Slovick’s hypochondriacal Barry is humorous. Concentrating on their relationship means we hear Weil-Mann classics like You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feelin’ (played here for laughs) but at the expense of developing King’s characterisation and her long career beyond the release of Tapestry. It is a stark contrast to Katori Hall’s masterfully lean chronology in Tina: The Tina Turner Musical. But Edd Lindley’s costumes are a delight (cloudy suits and eye-popping glitter jackets for the Drifters, fur-trimmed gowns for the Shirelles) and the multi-rolling support are strong. Give it up for Amena El-Kindy who, as King’s former babysitter Little Eva, performs The Loco-Motion on rollerskates and does it with ease. At Curve, Leicester, until 12 March.

3/4/2022,"A 28-year-old man has been charged with hate crimes in New York City in connection with a spree of attacks against seven Asian American women. The New York police department arrested Steven Zajonc outside a library in midtown Manhattan on Wednesday evening after two security guards recognized him from surveillance videos. Roshanta Williams, a New York Public Library guard who works at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Library, saw the suspect on Wednesday morning and realized that he frequented the library in the past months, according to an NYPL press release. Another guard, Lt Elmirel Cephas, told the New York Times that he had seen Zajonc, who is believed to be homeless, multiple times in the library in recent months, often six to seven days a week. According to Cephas, Zajonc would stay in the library from opening to closing hours and would keep to himself warm, occasionally getting up to go to the bathroom where he would change into slippers. “I was definitely surprised that it was him,” Cephas said. Iris Weinshall, the library’s chief operating officer, praised the guards, saying: “Our guards have the extremely challenging job, especially under recent circumstances, of keeping our branches safe and welcoming for all New Yorkers. “They do this extremely well every day, but today went above and beyond to help the NYPD keep our streets safer. We are so proud (but not surprised) of their quick thinking and good work,” she added. Zajonc, who is originally from Florida, has been charged with seven counts of assault and attempted assault classified as hate crimes, as well as with seven counts of aggravated harassment and harassment. According to police, Zajonc is currently in custody and has declined to make a statement. On Sunday evening, the suspect punched, shoved or elbowed the women without provocation in the span of two hours. Several women were left with facial swelling and cut lips. At least one had to be taken to a hospital for medical assistance. The attacks come as Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders face an alarming spike in hate crimes across the city. Earlier this week, the family of GuiYing Ma, an Asian woman who was struck by a man with a rock last fall in Queens, announced she had died after 10 weeks in a coma. Ma is the fourth Asian American in two months to die in New York as a result of violence against members of the AAPI community.

3/4/2022,"The House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack has subpoenaed Kimberly Guilfoyle, the fiancée of Donald Trump’s eldest son. House investigators issued the subpoena Thursday, after she had abruptly ended a voluntary interview with the panel last week. The committee is investigating the events surrounding the insurrection at the Capitol last year, when a mob of Trump supporters violently attacked the building in a failed attempt to halt the certification of Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory. The chairman of the select committee, Bennie Thompson, said in the subpoena letter to Guilfoyle that the panel was compelling her testimony because of her proximity to the former president and the rally that preceded the Capitol attack on January 6. Thompson said the panel had been left with no choice but to force her cooperation. “Because Ms Guilfoyle backed out of her original commitment to provide a voluntary interview, we are issuing today’s subpoena that will compel her to testify. We expect her to comply with the law and cooperate,” Thompson said. Guilfoyle met virtually with the panel for an interview last week, but cut off questioning when she learned that select committee members Adam Schiff and Jamie Raskin – in addition to counsel – had joined the call. After news of her appearance was leaked to news outlets, Guilfoyle refused to continue, and her lawyer accused the select committee of trying to “sandbag” her and not keeping participants limited to committee counsel, according to a source familiar with the interview. Members of the select committee are actively involved in the investigation, and are almost always present at depositions. But Guilfoyle’s lawyer said in a statement that the panel sought to use her cooperation as a “political weapon” against Trump. “Ms Guilfoyle, under threat of subpoena, agreed to meet exclusively with counsel for the select committee in a good-faith effort to provide true and relevant evidence,” Joseph Tacopina, Guilfoyle’s lawyer, said in a statement after she halted her interview. “However, upon Ms Guilfoyle’s attendance, the committee revealed its untrustworthiness, as members notorious for leaking information appeared,” Tacopina said, referring to the two congressmen Schiff and Raskin. The lawyer for Guilfoyle added that after he asked for a break to address the issue with House investigators, the select committee leaked the breakdown in proceedings to reporters. A spokesman for the select committee has denied Tacopina’s claim. The select committee did not address those complaints on Thursday. But the subpoena authorization suggested the panel does not believe the matter precludes her from testifying about her contacts with Trump and rally organizers on January 6. The panel additionally noted that it had earlier informed her legal team that members would be present in her interview and even offered to reschedule Guilfoyle’s interview, but she declined. Guilfoyle was notably present for an Oval Office meeting that morning when Trump pressed then vice-president Mike Pence to reject slates of electors for Biden at the joint session of Congress and thus return him to power, the subpoena said. House investigators added in the subpoena that they were also interested in Guilfoyle’s claims that she helped fund the “Save America” rally that preceded the Capitol attack, as well as discussions with Trump about who spoke at the rally. Guilfoyle told at least one rally organizer that she had “raised so much money for this. Literally one of my donors Julie at 3m” – a reference to Julie Fancelli, who did in fact finance the event, the panel said.",News/US news,"January 6 panel subpoenas Kimberly Guilfoyle, fiancee of Donald Trump Jr",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/03/kimberly-guilfoyle-subpoena-january-6-committee
3/4/2022,"Paul Farmer, the physician, anthropologist and visionary leader of the American non-profit organisation Partners in Health (PIH), defied sceptics who said poor countries are “health deserts”. Forging partnerships between governments, academic institutions and philanthropists, he made it possible for even the poorest communities to have world-class hospitals and astonishingly successful health programmes. Farmer, who has died suddenly aged 62, co-founded PIH in 1987 and led its work in 12 countries, including Haiti, Rwanda, Peru and Sierre Leone, with 18,000 staff. A passionate believer in social justice and building local capacity, he said medical treatment is not enough if people are sick because they are starving and destitute. He said PIH had to be “the house of yes”, working with government partners to build wraparound care that met both short- and long-term needs, from cash so patients could buy food, to community health workers, sanitation, hospitals and schools. Farmer’s ambition to found PIH was sparked while living in Haiti aged 23. Having studied anthropology at Duke University, North Carolina, he was working for a Haitian charity before going to Harvard medical school. It was a country scarred from centuries of exploitation, poverty and colonial rule. Following the construction of the Péligre Dam in the centre, displaced families were living in camps with little food, sanitation or running water, at the mercy of malaria, TB and typhoid. Spending time in this region, in the village of Cange, Farmer was appalled and wanted to set up a decent medical service. In Haiti and later at Harvard, Farmer discussed his ideas with kindred spirits, Ophelia Dahl, then volunteering in Haiti, his Duke University friend Todd McCormack and fellow Harvard medic Jim Yong Kim, who became his co-founders of PIH. The project received a huge fillip when the Boston philanthropist Tom White read an article Farmer had written. White offered $1m funding, and in 1987 PIH began. By now Farmer was a medical student. He would cram his studies into four days and fly on a Thursday night to Cange in Haiti (sometimes with medicines begged from the Harvard dispensary in his suitcase) to treat patients in the tiny clinic funded by PIH, which was the only medical centre for miles. Central to its success was a network of community health workers who could hike into outlying settlements and check up on patients at home. After qualifying in 1990, Farmer worked his way up to become chair of global health and social medicine at Harvard Medical School and chief of global health equity at Brigham and Women’s hospital in Boston. Wiry, tall and always working at a furious pace, throughout his career he combined teaching and treating patients in Boston with writing books and continuing to provide the road map for PIH. The organisation grew exponentially from the 1990s, helped by partners that included governments, corporations and charitable organisations such as the Gates Foundation. In addition, every time Farmer won an award (such as the “genius grant” of $200,000 in 1993 from the MacArthur Foundation) he funnelled it into PIH. For decades Farmer was in perpetual motion, flying from country to country, furthering PIH’s projects. His ambitions to bring quality healthcare to Haiti culminated in the state-of-the-art university hospital in Mirebalais in 2013. In the recent earthquake in 2021, the first responders were the new cohort of doctors and nurses trained at Mirebalais. In Peru, Farmer desperately wanted to tackle TB. It had come into sharp focus when in 1995 his friend the Catholic priest Jack Roussin died of a drug-resistant form of the disease contracted while living and working in the country. PIH set up programmes to help TB patients in Peru, with a success rate of 83%. It expanded its remit in that country to run programmes in mental health, HIV and maternal and child health. At an Aids meeting in New York, Farmer met Dr Agnes Binagwaho, later Rwanda’s health minister. As a result, PIH was invited to help rebuild Rwanda’s healthcare system, which had been wiped out by the genocide in 1994, and worked in the country from 2005. Some of the world-class initiatives included vaccinating 93% of girls against cervical cancer in record time, opening the Butaro Cancer Center in 2012 and creating the University of Global Health Equity. Farmer faced one of his biggest challenges when he visited west Africa in 2014 to organise the fight against Ebola in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. He documented this fast-moving episode in his 2020 book Fevers, Feuds, and Diamonds: Ebola and the Ravages of History. He wrote a dozen books and was the subject of a 2017 documentary film, Bending the Arc. His story was first told in Tracy Kidder’s book Mountains Beyond Mountains: One Doctor’s Quest to Heal the World (2003). Farmer was born in North Adams, Massachusetts, the second of six children. His father, also Paul, was a teacher and his mother, Ginny (nee Rice) worked in a supermarket. They were a family of free spirits, encouraged to take risks and follow their dreams, which were all quite different; his younger brother Jeff, for example, became a professional wrestler. When Paul was seven, the family moved to Alabama, but, disliking the racist politics there, they moved on to Florida. Their home was a bus, which originally had been a mobile TB clinic, and for a short time they lived on a houseboat. He went to school in Brooksville, Florida, before winning a scholarship to Duke University. He spent a summer in Paris, where he became fluent in French, and read the work of Rudolf Virchow and became fascinated with epidemiology and public health. While he was at Duke, Farmer met a nun, Sister Julianna, who was working with Haitians employed in the tobacco plantations and he became interested in their history. After he graduated in 1982, it seemed natural to visit Haiti while he waited to go to medical school. Farmer’s long association with Haiti was further strengthened when he married Didi Bertrand, a Haitian medical anthropologist, in 1996. He pushed himself constantly, always concerned there was another patient to treat, another paper to write. He died in his sleep from a cardiac event, after a day teaching students in the hospital he helped build in Butaro, Rwanda. Farmer is survived by Didi and their three children, Catherine, Elizabeth and Sebastian; his mother, Ginny; his brothers, James and Jeffrey; and his sisters, Katy, Jennifer and Peggy.

3/4/2022,"Police have been granted extra time to question a man arrested on suspicion of the murders of a divorced couple in Gloucestershire. Clive and Valerie Warrington were found by emergency services with stab wounds at separate locations on Wednesday. Magistrates at Cheltenham magistrates’ court authorised that the man can be held in custody for an additional 36 hours. This will expire in the early hours of 5 March, police said. The body of Clive Warrington, 67, was found after reports of a serious assault in Sherborne Place, Cheltenham, at around 6.25am. The body of his 73-year-old ex-wife was found a short time later about 15 miles away at an address in the Cotswold village of Bourton-on-the-Water. The suspect was arrested near to the scene in Cheltenham. Gloucestershire police said the two victims and the suspect were known to one another and they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths. The couple’s children have thanked well-wishers for the messages they have received. They said in a statement: “We are devastated by the sudden and tragic loss of our parents. “We thank everyone for their messages of love and support, which are of great comfort to us. “We would like to request privacy at this time so that we can come to terms with what has happened and grieve in peace with the rest of the family.” On Wednesday, detectives called on anyone with any information to get in touch, particularly those who may have dashcam or CCTV footage of the two areas.",News/UK news,Extra time for police to question Gloucestershire double murder suspect,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/03/extra-time-for-police-to-question-gloucestershire-double-suspect
3/4/2022,"There hasn’t been so much drama on Q+A since an audience member threw a shoe at then prime minister John Howard as he was talking about Australia’s involvement in the war in Iraq 12 years ago. On Thursday night, a pro-Putin member of the Q+A audience was dramatically booted out of the ABC studio by the host, Stan Grant, after he asked a pro-Russia question that Grant said was not vetted by producers. The world is watching as Russian troops continue a full-scale invasion of Europe’s second largest country. If you have a question for the panel, submit it via the #QandA website now: https://t.co/BOVpYtQB0j pic.twitter.com/2wqeEm7cJw The young man, Sasha Gillies-Lekakis, had asked a “rogue” question, Grant said, that prompted shouts of “lies” from the audience. “As someone who comes from the Russian community here in Australia, I’ve been pretty outraged by the narrative created by our media depicting the Ukraine as ‘the good guy’ and Russia as ‘the bad guy’,” Gillies-Lekakis said. Has Western media lacked nuance in its depiction of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and ignored Russian voices who support Putin? #QandA pic.twitter.com/E4j1oIff3S “Believe it or not, there are a lot of Russians here and around the world that support what Putin is doing in the Ukraine, myself included. Since 2014, the Ukrainian government together with Nazi groups like the Azov Battalion have besieged the Russian populations in the Donbas killing an estimated 13,000 people according to the United Nations. “My question is: where was your outpouring of grief and concern for those thousands of mostly Russians?” An audience member interjected with “That’s a lie” and “Don’t do this, it’s propaganda” before Grant tried to clarify the figures involved. “The United Nations has listed 13,000 total people killed since the conflict, but you’re trying to suggest that is Russians killed by Ukrainians,” Grant said. “The United Nations has pointed out there is 13,000 killed since the conflict began in 2014.” After a brief discussion, the program moved on to other issues including the floods in New South Wales and Queensland but a visibly unnerved Grant returned to address the young man later in the show. “Something has been bothering me, I have to admit, since we had Sasha’s question earlier about Russia, and it’s been playing on my mind,” Grant said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Sasha, people here have been talking about family who are suffering and people who are dying. You supported what’s happening, hearing that people are dying. Can I just say – I’m just not comfortable with you being here. Could you please leave?” But Gillies-Lekakis did not want to leave and protested. Grant said: “You can ask a question but we cannot advocate violence. I should have asked you to leave then. It’s been playing on my mind and, I’m sorry, but I have to ask you to leave.” The audience applauded Grant’s stance and, while Gillies-Lekakis initially resisted, he did leave while the camera stayed on Grant. Grant apologised for the disruption. “It was not a vetted question,” he said. “It was a question that was, you know, a rogue question, if you like. It’s not good to exclude people, but we have to take those steps from time to time.” Gillies-Lekakis on Friday morning posted a lengthy statement on Facebook – that he said he’d also sent to the ABC – regarding his question and subsequent removal from the Q+A audience. “I am aware there has been a lot of controversy surrounding certain statements I made and the position I took regarding the Russia-Ukraine situation,” he wrote. “I am unequivocally against war and the loss of any lives, be they Ukrainian, Russian, or any other, and want to be clear that I made no statements indicating anything to the contrary – I made no direct statement sanctioning violence or conflict. “I was hoping to make the point that I support Putin’s grievances regarding the breaking of the Minsk peace agreement by the Ukraine, and the ensuing loss of life, particularly in the Russian-populated areas of the Donbas.” Gillies-Lekakis also said it was “simply not true” that his question was unvetted. He said he submitted it online and was told to edit it via email and again in the studio before the program. “The only addition I made to my question when actually delivering it was my reference to the Azov Battalion … and some sentences were left out towards the end as I was interrupted,” he said. Gillies-Lekakis said being asked to leave and Grant’s statements following his departure were “disappointing and unprofessional”. “I am genuinely sorry things took the turn they did,” he said. “However, at the same time, an acknowledgment of the ABC’s questionable conduct would also be appreciated – if my question was not appropriate for the show after being vetted and edited, I wonder why I was invited at all.”",News/Australia news,Q+A audience member booted from studio after asking pro-Russia ‘rogue’ question,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/04/qa-audience-member-booted-from-studio-after-asking-pro-russia-rogue-question
