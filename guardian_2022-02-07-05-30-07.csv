2/7/2022,"The numbers of cancer patients facing delays in seeing a specialist for the first time and starting their treatment have hit record highs in England, amid fears that overstretched NHS services can no longer provide prompt care. The disclosure comes as a new row over how quickly hospitals can clear the record 6 million-strong NHS backlog has forced ministers to delay publication of the long-awaited plan to tackle it  Half a million people in England with suspected cancer will have to wait longer than the supposed two-week maximum to see an oncologist this year, an analysis for the House of Commons library reveals. The number of patients confirmed to have the disease who are unable to start treatment such as surgery or chemotherapy within the 31 or 62 days that hospitals try to guarantee is expected to exceed 75,000 for the first time. Experts, who claim significant shortages in the NHS cancer workforce are to blame, fear delays in getting diagnosed and starting care could reduce a patient’s chances of survival. Cancer charities highlighted the “unimaginable distress and anxiety” they induce in patients. “Cancer care is in crisis,” the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, said. “As this new analysis shows, terrifyingly large numbers of people are waiting longer than they should to receive vital cancer care and treatment with the insecurity of not knowing.” Streeting, who was treated for kidney cancer last year, asked the Commons library to analyse the NHS’s performance against the array of targets introduced 11 years ago that in theory guarantee patients speedy care. The analysis found that between April and November last year 290,428 people with possible symptoms of cancer did not get to see a specialist within 14 days of being urgently referred by a GP. After seven months of the year that is already far higher than the previous highest number breaches of the target, the 235,549 recorded last year. They include 91,896 people who may have breast cancer, 76,307 with suspected skin cancer and 47,936 who GPs believe may be suffering from lower gastro-intestinal cancer. The total figure equates to 41,490 people a month. If that trend continues, as many as 497,877 people who have a lump, unexplained bleeding or other potential sign of the disease will have missed out on a first appointment by the time 2021-22 ends at the end of next month. If confirmed, it will represent an almost 11-fold rise on the 45,291 such cases seen a decade ago. “These figures show the huge challenge the NHS faces in clearing the cancer backlog. This is a time of real worry and anxiety for people waiting for a cancer diagnosis, with any delay creating the risk of a worse prognosis”, said Minesh Patel, the head of policy at Macmillan Cancer Support. The analysis also shows that the proportion of women who GPs fear may have breast cancer who see an oncologist within two weeks has fallen to just 72.7% – the lowest since records began. Delyth Morgan, the chief executive of Breast Cancer Now, said: “It’s highly alarming that increasing numbers of women with potential breast cancer symptoms are waiting over two weeks to be seen by a specialist. “Ensuring that women with breast cancer get a prompt diagnosis and start treatment as quickly as possible gives them the best chance of survival.” She urged ministers to “put an end to agonising delays for women” and boost the NHS breast cancer workforce “which was already overstretched and chronically under-resourced prior to the pandemic”. Some hospitals are so short of specialist cancer nurses that they have had to limit the amount of chemotherapy they provide. Commons researchers also found that 12,498 people diagnosed with cancer during the first seven months of 2021-22 were unable to undergo their “first definitive treatment” within 31 days of doctors deciding to treat them. That is another record high compared with the 13,907 such cases recorded in 2020-21 and could mean that by the end of March about 21,425 people will have waited longer than a month this year. Ten years ago the same figure was 4,005. Even larger numbers of cancer patients are not having their “first definitive treatment“ 62 days after an urgent GP referral. Between April and November in all 32,647 people missed out on undergoing surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy within that timescale, which is another key NHS cancer target. Again, if the 4,664 people a month denied that chance is repeated until the end of next month, then a total of 55,966 people across the whole of 2021-22 will have been affected. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) was expected to publish the “elective recovery plan” detailing measures to tackle the 6-million backlog, on Monday. That, however, has been delayed for a second time by a fresh bout of wrangling between NHS England and the government over how how demanding the targets imposed on hospitals should be. The disagreement centres on the deadline by which NHS trusts will have to have treated all those who have been waiting either one year or two years for care, usually an operation. “Conversations about the targets have become protracted and difficult. The Treasury wants a certain scale of ambition, they want tougher targets than NHS England thinks is feasible”, said an NHS source. Another NHS source said: “There will be an aim to end 104-week waiters by the end of March. And nobody will wait more than a year for treatment by March 2025, but the government are trying to bring that forward to March 2024, and that is still being negotiated.” The Commons library’s research shows that the number of patients not getting cancer care on time has been rising relentlessly every year since Labour first created the targets in 2009. “The Conservatives blame the pandemic”, said Streeting. “But the state of cancer care has been worsening every year since 2010, and the NHS had record long waiting lists and 100,000 staff shortages before Covid hit. It’s a bit rich for the Tories to now declare a ‘war on cancer’ when they spent the last 12 years disarming the NHS through mismanagement and underfunding.” The Guardian approached the DHSC for their response.",News/Society,NHS England waiting times for cancer referral and treatment at record high,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/06/nhs-england-waiting-times-for-cancer-referral-and-treatment-at-record-high
2/7/2022,"Allies of Boris Johnson have insisted that “grownups” are now in charge of his operation as he heads into critical week for his beleaguered premiership that could see him face a confidence vote and the threat of further damaging revelations. Tory MPs said Johnson may have bought some time by bringing a new team into No 10. One major Conservative donor, Alexander Temerko, told the Guardian that the prime minister should now take the opportunity to “purge” the cabinet of disloyal leadership rivals.  However, critics of Johnson’s leadership said they thought the number of letters of no confidence in the prime minister was now not far off the 54 necessary to trigger a ballot on his premiership. “It’s really hard to know, but I’m pretty sure the numbers are in the 40s, so it’s only a small surge that could take it over the line,” said one former cabinet minister. “Having said that, he may well survive the vote itself. There are people doing that calculation, saying they’ll hold off until they think he’ll lose.” Johnson is also facing the possibility of more revelations from Dominic Cummings, his former senior adviser. Cummings, who revealed details of some of the No 10 parties, is said to be planning to raise further questions this week about the furore over the funding of his £112,000 flat refurbishment initially funded through a loan from a Tory donor. A report in the Sunday Times also said the prime minister’s wife was tiring of the pressure they are both under. More than 15 MPs have called on Johnson to resign, about half of whom have publicly confirming they have submitted letters of no confidence. On Sunday, Mark Harper, a former chief whip and major sceptic of Covid rules, gave a scathing assessment of the prime minister’s conduct, saying: “No 10’s repeated denials, changing stories and drift resulting from the scandal around unlawful lockdown parties have led to many of my constituents questioning the prime minister’s honesty, integrity and fitness for office. These views now appear to be widespread across the country.” He added: “Conservatives still have so much to offer to our country, so it’s vital for Conservative MPs to consider all the options necessary to get our party back on track.” No 10 is planning a fightback this week with a series of policy announcements to show it is trying to turn the page on the partygate scandal, even though 12 gatherings are still under police investigation and the final Sue Gray report is yet to come. Johnson has also implemented several staff changes, bringing in Guto Harri, a former aide and ex-BBC journalist, as his new communications director and making Cabinet Office minister Steve Barclay his chief of staff. Henry Newman, a deputy chief of staff and ally of Carrie Johnson, is expected to return to a role with his former boss Michael Gove. Harri told the Guardian he was “proud to join a team of capable, grownup, professional and pragmatic people that will hopefully allow the PM and his cabinet to operate effectively and deliver what they promised to the people”. He added that there were big post-pandemic challenges that they would “really need to get on with”. Harri’s appointment was for the main part welcomed by Tory MPs despite his having backed remain in the EU referendum, with two senior Brexit-supporting MPs saying it was “very positive” and a return at long last to “sensible” appointments. One said it would hopefully provide more stability after the era of Cummings and the subsequent era of aides close to the prime minister’s wife. However, there was more scepticism among some Tories about Barclay’s role; one MP said he was seen with suspicion by some who believe he is an ally of Rishi Sunak. The chancellor has given Johnson only lukewarm support over the parties and distanced himself from No 10 over the prime minister’s false Jimmy Savile slur towards Labour leader Keir Starmer. Experts have also questioned whether Barclay is taking on too wide a brief, with his Cabinet Office ministerial role in addition to his chief of staff job and responsbilities as an MP. A spokesman said many of his ministerial responsibilities would be redistributed to other ministers within the Cabinet Office. With Johnson’s future still hanging by a thread, Temerko, who has given more than £600,000 to the Conservative party, said he was urging other donors and his “friends in parliament” to continue supporting Johnson. The Ukrainian-born businessman, who co-owns an energy firm called Aquind, last month threatened legal action against the government for turning down its plans to build a controversial £1.2bn electricity and internet cable running from the UK to France. Temerko said: “Our party leader, Boris Johnson, is today the best candidate to be the prime minister; he now has nothing to lose, and so must be bold, and thus make urgent decisions to stabilise the situation in the energy market and the general economy, I believe. I can only recommend him to consider a serious reshuffle, and to purge from the cabinet those who try to trigger internal party contests, rather than focusing on their ministerial duties.” Penny Mordaunt, the Conservative MP for Portsmouth North and a former defence secretary, had led calls opposing the project, saying it was not helpful to the UK’s energy security. The majority owner of Aquind was revealed in 2020 to be Viktor Fedotov, a Russian-born billionaire.",News/Politics,Johnson allies insist ‘grownups’ in charge of new team at No 10,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/06/johnson-allies-insist-grownups-in-charge-of-new-team-at-no-10
2/7/2022,"Good morning. There are fresh warnings about a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Morrison government says it will restore ABC funding. And the future of Neighbours is in doubt. Russia has enough troops in place to seize Kyiv or another Ukrainian city but not yet for a full takeover and occupation of the country, Ukraine’s former defence minister has said, as Washington warned that an invasion could take place at any time. Andriy Zagorodnyuk said in an interview with the Guardian that the situation looked “pretty dire”: “Russia could now seize any city in Ukraine. But we still don’t see the 200,000 troops needed for a full-scale invasion.” Germany is preparing to send reinforcements to its battle group in Lithuania as the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, headed to Washington to reassure Nato allies his country can be relied upon.  The government will restore ABC funding to 2018 levels, when Malcolm Turnbull imposed an $84m indexation pause, with the public broadcaster to be given $3.3bn for the next three years. The communications minister, Paul Fletcher, has also announced SBS will receive $953.7m, including an additional $37.5m in ongoing funding to support its long-term sustainability, as part of the government’s response to the media reform green paper. On the eve of the Winter Olympics, China promised the world a “streamlined, safe and most splendid” Games. But just two days into the event organisers are facing a litany of complaints from athletes and countries on multiple fronts. The Swedes have suggested that the conditions in the mountains are perilously cold. A Polish skater says she was living in fear in a Beijing isolation ward and has “cried until I have no more tears”. The Finns have claimed an ice hockey player is being kept in Covid quarantine for no reason. And the Germans? They are frustrated there is no hot food at the downhill skiing. Rapid antigen Covid tests will be made tax deductible for workers and businesses, but the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, says other economic support measures must wind up as the economy returns to normal. Neighbours has been axed in the UK in a move that could sound the death knell for the show. Australian broadcaster Network Ten says it is determined to save the show but it needs a new backer. The Sex Work Decriminalisation Act 2021 is to be debated in Victoria’s parliament this week. The bill will repeal offences for consensual sex work, strengthen anti-discrimination protections for workers and allow the industry to be regulated using existing laws that apply to all other Victorian businesses. Here’s a closer look at the legislation. Western Australia holds the key to Australia’s emissions goals. But can a government so committed to gas deliver? Environmentalists fear the premier could legislate away regulations and undo progress towards net zero at the stroke of a pen. A landmark homelessness report reveals health and discrimination problems, with the paper’s authors calling for a new national strategy. The US has suffered 900,000 deaths from Covid-19, the highest figure of any nation. America also has the highest death rate of any wealthy country, with half of the deaths occurring after vaccines became available. A prominent journalist has been arrested under terrorism and sedition laws as a crackdown on the press in Indian-administered Kashmir continues to escalate. Tributes have been paid to Rayan Oram, the five-year-old Moroccan boy whose body was recovered from a well on Saturday, and whose plight had moved his country and the world. The Prince of Wales has paid tribute to his “darling wife” the Duchess of Cornwall for her “steadfast support” after the Queen announced that Camilla would be known as “Queen Consort” when Charles becomes king. Amid the hype over her acclaimed performance as Diana, Princess of Wales in Spencer, Kristen Stewart briefly stopped awards pundits dead in their tracks when, upon being asked about her Oscar buzz, she drily admitted: “I don’t give a shit.” Sacrilege! Some of the best films and performances of all time haven’t been considered by the Academy, she continued. “There’s five spots. What the fuck are you going to do?” Nobody disagrees with Stewart on any of this: just ask our critics, whose ideal Oscar ballots are knowingly far from the expected reality of next week’s nominations. On the eve of his new double album, Johnny Marr takes questions from readers and celebrity fans on being a style icon, marrying young and 20 years without booze. At 30, Adeel Akhtar was all but homeless – now he’s been nominated for this year’s Baftas. Here the actor talks about the beauty of ordinary lives, racism, role models and feeling hopeful. Joe Rogan’s popularity is down to his ability to connect with his predominantly white male listeners – and to be a relatable, self-optimising role model, journalist Devin Gordon tells Michael Safi. Rogan says he has learned from controversy. But how much is he prepared to change the approach that brought him success?

For the first time in Winter Olympics history Australia had won more than one medal on a single day: Tess Coady claimed bronze in the women’s snowboard slopestyle. This past week has marked five years since the first AFLW game was played. It is still far too easy to identify cracks in the league, including a lack of representation, a truncated season and an ongoing pursuit of pay parity. Equally, though, looking back also serves as a way of counting blessings. In five years, all AFL clubs now have a women’s side. The AFLW has gone from being a largely symbolic league moulded in the shape of the men’s competition to a distinct and strategic offering for the AFL. Women and girls have signed up to play football in droves. During an interview with 60 Minutes, the parents of Cleo Smith, a four-year-old girl who was abducted for 18 days, said their daughter was still coming to terms with being held captive, WA Today reports. Cleo is “happy, bubbly, sad and angry”. Australian skier Katie Parker will not be able to compete in the giant slalom after continuing to test positive for Covid-19, despite having recovered from the virus, Sydney Morning Herald reports. Most Queensland students return to school. An inquest into the death of Kevin Bugmy, 57, an Aboriginal man who died in custody at a correctional centre, will be held.

2/7/2022,"Syl Johnson, the blues, funk and soul singer whose work was much sampled in US hip-hop, has died aged 85. No cause of death was announced by his family, who said of Johnson: “He lived his life as a singer, musician and entrepreneur who loved black music … A fiery, fierce, fighter, always standing for the pursuit of justice as it related to his music and sound, he will truly be missed by all who crossed his path.”  Born in Mississippi in 1936, Johnson was raised in Chicago where he remained throughout his life. He released his first solo material in 1959, and wrote genre-straddling work that led him to describe himself as “a jack-of-all-trades. More soul than Marvin [Gaye], more funk than James [Brown]”. He had his biggest hit in 1975 with Take Me To the River, the song by labelmate Al Green that would also be recorded by Talking Heads. It reached No 7 in the US R&B chart and crossed over into the Top 50 of the pop chart. Perhaps his most famous song, though, is Different Strokes, sampled by dozens of hip-hop artists: its catchy brass line was used by the Wu-Tang Clan while Kanye West and Jay-Z used Johnson’s energetic exclamations on their track The Joy. It also appears on classics such as De La Soul’s The Magic Number, Public Enemy’s Fight the Power and Eric B & Rakim’s I Know You Got Soul. Another key Johnson track was Is It Because I’m Black?, a slow, disconsolate ballad that is among the most affecting of the civil rights era. It too was frequently sampled, once again by Wu-Tang Clan and also Snoop Dogg and Cypress Hill. Johnson attempted to sue the latter group, arguing their sample wasn’t cleared, but lost in 2008 and on appeal in 2011. Johnson reached a settlement with West and Jay-Z over their use of Different Strokes in 2012. “I’m not Bill Gates, but I’ll never have to worry about money again because of the rappers,” he said in 2010. After releasing 10 albums, Johnson retired in the late 1980s, but returned to music in the mid-1990s. He recorded with daughter Syleena Johnson, an R&B singer best known for her guest vocal on Kanye West’s hit single All Falls Down. His albums found a new audience after they were reissued by the label Numero Group in 2010 – their box set of his work earned him two Grammy nominations. The label said in tribute: “Sock it to ‘em wherever you end up next, old friend.”",Arts/Music,"Syl Johnson, much-sampled blues, funk and soul singer, dies aged 85",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/06/syl-johnson-much-sampled-blues-funk-and-soul-singer-dies-aged-85
