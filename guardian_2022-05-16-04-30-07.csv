5/16/2022,"Frank Lampard was critical of the officials after Everton lost 3-2 to Brentford. Jarrad Branthwaite and Salomón Rondón were sent off and the manager was left upset by his side not being given a penalty in the buildup to the first dismissal, when the home side were 1-0 up. Richarlison was having his shirt pulled by Mads Bech Sørensen in the area but Michael Oliver did not award a penalty, allowing Brentford to clear the ball up the pitch, where Branthwaite pulled down Ivan Toney to earn his first-half red. “I thought it was a penalty,” Lampard said. “It’s a shirt pull, a clear shirt pull, it’s a foul in the box. If you’re asking Richarlison to go down then you’re asking people to fall on the floor. My players have been criticised, when they shouldn’t have been, for going down for fouls that are fouls. I think that was a penalty. I can’t complain about the red after that. If they don’t give that [the penalty] then it’s a red card. “The reality is we’re on the bad end of a lot of decisions this season. That’s hard because I have to represent the club and the fans that come here and those small margins can affect our position. I do believe if it’s a penalty on the shirt pull means 2-0 and 11 men, and I think we all know how that game goes.” Sørensen did give away a penalty for a pull on Richarlison before half-time but the defender was not given a second yellow card, which Lampard believes would have been deserved. Rondón will be unavailable for Everton’s crucial final two games against Crystal Palace and Arsenal and Branthwaite for the first of those, a further blow to Lampard. Rondón was sent off for a two-footed lunge on Rico Henry four minutes after coming off the bench. “Salomón’s is a bad tackle, I think you see in his reaction then he comes off. It’s a hot-headed reaction. It’s not the Salomón I know.”",Sport/Football,‘We’re on the bad end of decisions’: Lampard unhappy after Everton lose,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/15/were-on-the-bad-end-of-decisions-lampard-unhappy-after-everton-lose
5/16/2022,"Boris Johnson is poised to give the green light to controversial legislation on the Northern Ireland protocol this week as he flies to Belfast for crunch meetings, gambling that the move will restart stalled talks. Amid frayed relations between the prime minister and Liz Truss, Johnson will emphasise the need for restrained language to his foreign secretary. However, he is still poised to sign off her preferred tactic for new legislation which would override parts of the protocol to remove checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. Truss has prepared a bill giving the government the right to suspend elements of the Brexit deal relating to Northern Ireland, a move which the EU has warned could spark a trade war. Measures in the bill are expected to include a new “green lane” for goods for sale only in Northern Ireland and stronger penalties for those smuggling into the EU via the Republic. One official said they expected the time frame for the legislation to be decelerated to allow diplomatic efforts to resume. Another Whitehall official acknowledged the legislation was “several weeks away” from being formally put to MPs. Dozens of Conservative MPs have suggested they would vote against a bill in its later stages. A Whitehall source said they acknowledged the internal briefing war of the past week, which included cabinet splits and threw the internal choreography in crisis, had been unhelpful with a decades-old peace process at stake. “The priority tomorrow is to calm things down,” they said. The source suggested Johnson would tell Truss to handle things more delicately. Sources close to Truss have denied her team leaked details of the planned legislation and say they have not been responsible for some of the more inflammatory rhetoric – which they claim has irritated the foreign secretary. “The ideal solution is that we work through the problems with the protocol with the EU and through a negotiated solution and get the executive back up and running,” a government source said. “If they are not willing to show flexibility it’s our responsibility as a government to look at other options. [Truss] does favour looking at legislation as a way of doing that. But there is a difference between giving ourselves the powers to do something and then actually doing something.” No 10 said it was Johnson’s priority to restore the conditions for negotiations – claiming he had a “conciliatory” call with Ireland’s taoiseach last week. However, the Irish Times on Saturday reported sources describing it as “the single worst call he [Martin] has ever had with anyone”. Johnson is expected to meet the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Féin in Belfast on Monday. The DUP blocked the election of a speaker at Stormont on Friday, meaning the assembly is unable to function after the elections where Sinn Féin became the largest party. Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O’Neill who is first minister designate, said she would warn Johnson that any unilateral action to walk away from the protocol would be “reckless” and “deepen political instability”. “Any threat of unilateral action by the British government to denounce the withdrawal agreement, or disapply the protocol would be reckless. Walking away from international obligations would also represent an appalling attack on the international rule of law,” she said. “Only through joint agreement with the EU can solutions to problems or concerns be resolved. I will be telling Boris Johnson that unilateral action deepens political instability and economic uncertainty and must not happen.” On Sunday the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said the UK had “the right to act in a sovereign way” and to “reopen or re-examine the protocol” but he denied the actions would constitute a breach of international law. Johnson has previously vowed not to scrap the protocol and said he is only seeking reform that has “the broadest possible cross-community support”. Simon Coveney, Ireland’s foreign minister, “criticised sabre-rattling and grandstanding” from ministers over the past week. Johnson has already been told that dozens of Conservative MPs would attempt to stop the bill from becoming law if it reaches the later stages – though many see it as a negotiating tactic. Coveney said the behaviour of UK ministers was “creating a lot of tension in my country, your closest neighbour, and also potentially being on the verge of making a decision that could fundamentally undermine the functioning of the institutions of the peace process in Northern Ireland”. He told Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News that the relations between Britain and Ireland were being fundamentally damaged because of “unhelpful briefings that we’re getting from very, very senior levels within the British government this week”. Coveney said the EU had not threatened any specific retaliation – though several European parliamentarians have said there will be consequences, including the potential suspension of the trade deal, should the UK government act unilaterally. “There’s no way the EU can compromise if the UK is threatening unilateral action to pass domestic legislation to set aside international obligations under an international treaty that, don’t forget, the UK was the primary designer of along with the EU,” he said.",News/UK news,Boris Johnson poised to give green light to bill on Northern Ireland protocol ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/15/boris-johnson-poised-to-agree-controversial-bill-to-suspend-parts-of-ni-protocol
5/16/2022,"David Tennant and Catherine Tate will return to Doctor Who for the show’s 60th anniversary celebrations, the BBC has announced. The duo have reunited after 12 years to film scenes that are due to air next year. Tennant, 51, first stepped into the Tardis in 2005 to play the 10th Time Lord, with his final episode airing on New Year’s Day in 2010. Comedic actor Tate, 52, starred as his companion Donna Noble. The Doctor and Donna parted ways when the Time Lord had to wipe her memory in order to save her life. He left her family with a warning that if she had a memory of the past, she would die, because the powers that she possessed threatened to overwhelm her brain. Russell T Davies, Doctor Who’s returning showrunner, said: “They’re back! And it looks impossible – first, we announce a new Doctor, and then an old Doctor, along with the wonderful Donna. What on earth is happening? “Maybe this is a missing story. Or a parallel world. Or a dream, or a trick, or a flashback. The only thing I can confirm is that it’s going to be spectacular, as two of our greatest stars reunite for the battle of a lifetime.” Tennant took over the protagonist’s role in 2005 from Christopher Eccleston, and was succeeded by Matt Smith. The Scottish actor returned for an appearance in the 50th anniversary special, The Day of the Doctor, in 2013. Like his predecessors, Tennant has continued to play the role off-screen in a series of spin-off audio releases. In 2020 he was voted the fans’ favourite Doctor. Tennant and Tate’s collaborations extend beyond Doctor Who. The pair worked on a stage version of Much Ado About Nothing together in 2011 and Tenant also made a cameo appearance on The Catherine Tate Show. Doctor Who returns to BBC One later this year with a 90-minute special episode to celebrate the BBC’s centenary, which will be Jodie Whittaker’s last appearance as the 13th Doctor. Sex Education actor Ncuti Gatwa, 29, will be taking over from Whittaker and becomes the fourth person of Scottish origin to take up the post following on from Sylvester McCoy, fellow Royal Conservatoire graduate Tennant and Peter Capaldi. Showrunner Chris Chibnall, who cast Whittaker as the programme’s first female protagonist, is leaving to be replaced by Davies, who was behind the programme’s 2005 reboot and left in 2009.",Arts/Television & radio,David Tennant and Catherine Tate to return to Doctor Who in 2023,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/15/david-tennant-catherine-tate-return-doctor-who-2023
5/16/2022,"The Metropolitan police are investigating social media footage which appears to show a man being repeatedly struck on the head by officers while on the ground in an incident in east London on Saturday evening. During a pre-planned operation to tackle moped and e-scooter crime in Dalston, an area which is often crowded with food delivery riders, police attempted to arrest a man for immigration offences and a crowd gathered to prevent it. The footage, posted to Twitter, shows a protester clashing with officers outside Kingsland shopping centre, and during a struggle he is seemingly struck in the head five times. Police said a number of officers were assaulted during the incident and that “any footage showing use of force” was being “reviewed” by the directorate of professional standards. On Twitter, the incident was described as “a bit of a standoff”, with the crowd in Dalston chanting “fuck the police”. A Met spokesperson said: “We are aware of a number of videos on social media filmed during the incident. We would urge people to remember that such videos rarely provide a full and accurate picture of what is taking place. “Police officers are aware that any use of force must be proportionate and reasonable, and they understand that their actions will be scrutinised as they go about their work and that they will be held to account where appropriate.” Nine people were arrested for offences including violent disorder. They remain in police custody. It comes after a similar standoff in Edinburgh on 5 May during which dozens of protesters gathered to stop Home Office vans leaving an area of the city after a raid. A Home Office spokesperson told the Daily Record that two people had been found to be in breach of immigration rules and have been placed on bail.",News/UK news,Met investigating video appearing to show man struck on head by officers,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/15/met-police-investigating-video-appearing-to-show-man-struck-head-officers-dalston-east-london
5/16/2022,"My grandmother, Elisabeth Evans, was a refugee from the Nazis during the second world war who found sanctuary in Britain. An only child, she lost most of her family during the conflict and went on to have eight children of her own. Elisabeth, who has died aged 96, was born in Pottenstein, Austria, to Rose (nee Fanta), who was Jewish, and Ludwig Achtner, a Lutheran lawyer who worked for Jewish clients in Vienna. Her later childhood was marked by the rise of Adolf Hitler, whose long speeches Elisabeth had to endure at compulsory youth rallies. By the eve of war, the family were in danger and Ludwig took his own life. Virtually all of her maternal family perished, murdered in ghettos and camps. She never fully recovered from the heartbreak of losing her grandparents and father. In the summer of 1939, Elisabeth and her mother arrived in London, the Quakers having helped arrange safe passage. Rose went into domestic service and Elisabeth was accepted into the celebrated Bunce Court school in Kent, run by Anna Essinger for children escaping from the Nazis. Elisabeth excelled at school and made lifelong friendships. By the mid-1940s she was living with Jewish friends and activists in what she described as a “London kibbutz” in Highgate. The property was destroyed one evening by German bombing, killing her friends, with Elisabeth surviving because her room lay above the rubble. A political person, astute and progressive, she met her husband, William Evans, an architect, when they were both active in the Labour party in Paddington. They married in 1948 and Elisabeth converted to Catholicism. She went on to have eight children, and later explained that she had been denied birth control. Her years as a busy mother and wife supportive of her husband’s career masked her own abilities. She was a talented pianist and mathematician. She was nonetheless devoted to her family. Always forgiving and loyal, she loved music, played the piano, read extensively, and was always informed (and usually angry) about politics. She smoked like a chimney for decades, until suddenly stopping in solidarity with one of her sons who was trying to quit. She did not drink, but had a taste for fine food, especially Austrian dishes. It was a blow to her when in the 1980s her marriage broke up, though she and William never divorced. Elisabeth is survived by seven of her eight children, 13 grandchildren, eight great-grandchildren and three great-great grandchildren.",News/World news,Elisabeth Evans obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/elisabeth-evans-obituary
