3/9/2022,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland is ready to deploy all its MIG-29 jets to Ramstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the United States, and urges other NATO members that own planes of that type to do the same, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday. U.S. lawmakers pushed President Joe Biden's administration on Monday to facilitate the transfer of fighter aircraft to Ukraine from Poland and other NATO and Eastern European countries, after a plea on Saturday from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. ""The authorities of the Republic of Poland...are ready to deploy – immediately and free of charge – all their MIG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America,"" the ministry said. ""At the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes,"" it said in a statement. Poland is supporting Kyiv with defensive weapons, but has said it would not send jets to Ukraine, as it is not a direct party to the conflict between Ukraine - which is not a NATO ally - and Russia. ""...any decisions on delivering offensive weapons have to be taken by the entire NATO and on a unanimous basis,"" Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Tuesday during a joint news conference with his Norwegian counterpart in Oslo. ""This is why we are ready to give all of our fleet of jet fighters to Ramstein, but we are not ready to make any moves on our own because, as I said, we are not party to this war,"" he added.

Zelensky added, ""The alliance is afraid of controversial things and confrontation with Russia."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that he has ""cooled down"" about Ukraine's bid to join NATO amid Russia's war with the eastern European country. ""Regarding NATO, I have cooled down regarding this question long ago after we understood that NATO is not prepared to accept Ukraine,"" Zelensky told ABC News in an exclusive interview published on Tuesday. Zelensky added, ""The alliance is afraid of controversial things and confrontation with Russia. I never wanted to be a country which is begging [for] something on its knees. We are not going to be that country and I don't want to be that president."" Ukraine's pursuit of NATO membership has been cited by Russian President Vladimir Putin as a justification for his decision to invade Ukraine. In 2008, Ukraine applied to begin a NATO Membership Action Plan and the alliance welcomed Ukraine's bid, pledging that the country would eventually become a member, though declining to offer a specific timeline. In addition to his NATO comments, Zelensky said on Tuesday that he is open to discussions about the control of Russian-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, possible openings to peace talks with Russia. ""It is important to me how people who want to be part of Ukraine will live there. I am interested in the opinion of those who see themselves as citizens of the Russian Federation. However, we must discuss this issue,"" Zelensky said. Before Putin launched Russia's war on Ukraine, Putin signed a decree recognizing the separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in the eastern province of Donbas as independent states. Putin demanded guarantees that Ukraine would not join NATO in the run-up to his invasion, a demand which the alliance's leaders repeatedly rejected. ""The people who elected me are not ready to surrender, we are not ready for ultimatums,"" Zelensky said. ""But we can discuss with Russia the future of Crimea and Donbas."" This story is developing.

3/9/2022,"Guests at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida were forced to wade through ankle-high waters following flash flooding. Footage from March 7 shows Disney visitors moving through flooded streets. One cast member told BBC Weather host Sara Thornton, who was at Disney World at the time, that “he’d never seen the likes [of this] in 17 years.” Christian Cowan grew up idolizing pop music’s biggest stars — and now he’s dressing them: Thornton also uploaded a video that showed the exit to the park, and some children can be seen playfully kicking the water. Nobody in Thornton’s clip seemed to be in any rush to leave. In another video she posted on Twitter, this time from Hollywood Studios, guests were lying down in the water and splashing one another as passersby covered in rain ponchos filmed the aftermath of the thunderstorm. According to the National Weather Service, the weather in Orlando, Fla., was somewhat unexpected. At about 8:52 p.m., thunderstorms and heavy rain struck the area. TikTok user @pagingmrmorrow was at Disney at the time and recorded the downpour when it hit. He captioned the video, “The best day ever,” and it racked up almost 3 million views. Another Twitter user, Ed Holmstrom, tweeted at a meteorologist for New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, saying, “Lake Buena Vista has the tri-state region beat tonight. We weren’t expecting 3 [inches] of rain while at Hollywood Studios.” @nynjpaweather Lake Buena Vista has the tri-state region beat tonight.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture highlighted several areas around Orlando that were “abnormally dry.” The drier-than-normal weather can lead to an increase in wildfire risk for the region. So the unexpected thunderstorm was certainly welcomed by locals. “Definitely welcomed rain for the region. We’ve really needed it,” said Fox 35 meteorologist Brook Garner. “The bottom line is we’re going to rinse and repeat the next few days because we’ve got hot weather on the way with the high around the 90s the next couple of days.” Tinashe is calling the shots: The post Disney guests shocked by unexpected Fla. flash flooding: ‘Never seen the likes [of this] in 17 years’ appeared first on In The Know.

3/9/2022,"By Essi Lehto HELSINKI (Reuters) - Hundreds of Russian passengers have filled up trains to Finland's capital Helsinki from Saint Petersburg every day since the war in Ukraine began and mutual airspace closures cut off flight connections between Russia and the European Union. The two trains on that route were almost empty before Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 but were now fully booked with 700 people arriving from Russia daily, Finland's public railway operator VR said. Hundreds more are driving to join lengthy queues at Finnish, Estonian or Latvian road border crossings as many Russians fearing a wider Russia-West conflict over Ukraine seek ways to leave the country. More than 2 million Ukrainians have so far fled the fighting in their country, most of them into neighbouring central and eastern European countries. [L2N2VB0W9] The EU has agreed to grant temporary residency to Ukrainian refugees but the status of Russians seeking extended stays in the bloc is unclear. For 40-year-old Philip, his wife and young daughter, the trip to Helsinki was supposed to be a much awaited four-day holiday for the Russian family but now they are not sure they will go back home. ""We just came here because that seemed to be the only quick way to get out of Saint Petersburg,"" he told Reuters after stepping off the train. ""People who understand what is really going on are really upset and I have already heard about several of my friends and colleagues who have either already left or they are desperately trying to leave,"" he added, requesting Reuters not mention his last name. Before the trip, he and his wife spent several days trying to withdraw as much money as they could from their savings accounts as financial uncertainty caused by western sanctions sent Russians scrambling for cash and a possible way out of the crisis. UNCERTAIN FUTURE Due to Russian COVID-19 restrictions, only Finnish and Russian citizens are allowed on the trains. The Finnish rail operator was negotiating with Russian authorities to allow other nationalities onboard as well, VR Finnish-Russian passenger service director Viktoria Hurri said. ""We are negotiating about putting a third train to run daily from Saint Petersburg and from Helsinki - but let's see what the authorities will say about that,"" Hurri said. Traffic at the Burachki road crossing from Russia into Latvia has also heavily increased since President Vladimir Putin ordered the attack on Ukraine. Moscow describes its actions in Ukraine as ""a special operation"" to disarm its neighbour. ""I have two sons close to military age. We got into this (decision to leave) late but we jumped in a car and left Moscow,"" said a Russian woman in her late 40s who had driven the eight hours from Moscow to the Burachki crossing. ""It does not matter if we cannot return, I have seen different things in my life, including the 90s in Russia. Now the key is to leave, to have some sleep and then decide how we will go to Italy to our house,"" she said, declining to be named. The future is unclear too for 23-year-old engineer Fedor who was at the train station in Helsinki to pick up his girlfriend who lives in Saint Petersburg. ""I'm not sure if she's moving permanently to Finland,"" said Fedor who no longer sees returning to Russia as an option even though it is his homeland. On the return journey to Russia, the trains have been a lot less busy, with roughly a quarter of seats occupied, VR said. Among those waiting on the platform to board is Islam, 29, who works as a systems engineer. ""My main goal is to see my friends because I suspect that I will not have any opportunities in the future,"" he told Reuters.

3/9/2022,"By Pavel Polityuk and Carlos Barria LVIV/IRPIN, Ukraine (Reuters) - A Western ban on Russian oil imports may more than double the price to $300 a barrel and prompt the closure of the main gas pipeline to Germany, Moscow warned on Monday, as talks on Ukraine hardly advanced amid efforts to agree on civilian safe passage. Russia's invasion, the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two, has created 1.7 million refugees, a raft of sanctions on Moscow, and fears of wider conflict in the West unthought-of for decades. Sieges and the bombing continued as Kyiv rejected possible humanitarian corridors to Russia and Belarus, but said some limited progress had been made on agreeing logistics for the evacuation of civilians. Moscow would give the residents of the Ukrainian cities of Sumy and Mariupol the choice of moving elsewhere in Ukraine on Tuesday, setting a deadline in the early hours for Kyiv to agree, Russian news agencies reported. Seeking to ratchet up the pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin, the United States said Washington and its European allies were considering banning Russian oil imports. Oil prices spiked to their highest levels since 2008. ""A rejection of Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market,"" said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, saying the price could more than double to over $300 per barrel. U.S. President Joe Biden held a video conference call with the leaders of France, Germany and Britain as he pushed for their support on the ban. But if need be the United States is willing to move ahead without allies in Europe, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Many countries on the continent are heavily reliant on Russian energy. Germany last month froze the certification of Nord Stream 2 that was due to pipe gas from Russia to Germany. ""We have every right to take a matching decision and impose an embargo on gas pumping through the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline,"" said Novak. The Russian economy, banking system, and currency have been under intense pressure as punishment for the assault on Ukraine. The country will be excluded from all of JPMorgan's fixed income indexes, the bank said in the latest such development on Monday. TALKS 'NOT EASY' More than 1.7 million Ukrainians have fled to Central Europe since the conflict began on Feb. 24, the United Nations refugee agency said on Monday. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. After the third attempt to ease the bloodshed at talks in Belarus, a Ukrainian negotiator said that although small progress on agreeing logistics for the evacuation of civilians had been made, things remained largely unchanged. ""As of now, there are no results that significantly improve the situation,"" Mykhailo Podolyak said. Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky told journalists the talks were ""not easy"". ""We hope that from tomorrow these corridors will finally work,"" he said. Russia has proposed two corridors inside of Ukraine, according to Interfax. Escape routes to Russia and Belarus, its close ally, were earlier called ""completely immoral"" by a spokesperson for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. A fourth round of talks are due soon, Russian negotiator Leonid Slutsky told Russian state television. ""Our president is not scared of anything, including a direct meeting with Putin,"" said Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba late on Monday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Reuters Moscow would halt operations if Ukraine ceased fighting, amended its constitution to declare neutrality, and recognised Russia's annexation of Crimea and the independence of regions held by Russian-backed separatists. French President Emmanuel Macron, who spoke with Putin multiple times last month in the run-up to the invasion, said he saw no impeding breakthrough. ""I don't think that in the coming days and weeks, there will be a real negotiated solution"", he said. FAILED EVACUATIONS The general staff of Ukraine's armed forces said Russian forces were ""beginning to accumulate resources for the storming of Kyiv"", a city of more than 3 million, after days of slow progress in their main advance south from Belarus. Outside the capital, attacks continued. A Russian strike on a bread factory killed 13 in the town of Makariv in the Kyiv region, Ukrainian officials said. Reuters could not verify the details. Russia denies targeting civilians. In the encircled southern port city of Mariupol, hundreds of thousands of people remained trapped without food and water under regular bombardments. Deputy mayor Sergei Orlov told CNN that authorities were ready to evacuate 6,000 people on Saturday but Russians had bombed buses that were to transport them. Moscow has accused the Ukrainians of blocking the planned evacuations. In the eastern city of Kharkiv, police said the total death toll from the Russian bombardment was 143 since the start of the invasion. It was not possible to verify the toll. In Irpin, people picked their way over the twisted ruins of a large bridge. ""It's like a disaster,"" a young woman leaving with her children told Reuters. Ukraine said on Monday its forces had retaken control of the town of Chuhuiv in the northeast after heavy fighting and of the strategic Mykolayiv airport in the south. Neither could immediately be verified. In a humanitarian update, the United Nations described one psychiatric hospital 60 km (40 miles) from Kyiv running out of water and medicine with 670 people trapped inside, including bedridden patients with severe needs. U.S. congressional negotiators on Monday were nearing a deal on a bill to provide Ukraine with billions of dollars in emergency aid. A senior U.S. defence official said Putin had now deployed into Ukraine nearly 100% of the more than 150,000 forces that he had pre-staged outside the country before the invasion. Moscow has acknowledged nearly 500 deaths among its soldiers, but Western countries say the true number is much higher and Ukraine says it is many thousands. Death tolls cannot be verified, but footage filmed across Ukraine shows burnt-out wreckage of Russian tanks and armour, and parts of Ukrainian cities reduced to rubble by Russian strikes.
