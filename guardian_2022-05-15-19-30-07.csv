5/15/2022,"Finland has formally confirmed it intends to join Nato, abandoning decades of military non-alignment in a historic decision triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Finland is applying for Nato membership,” said the country’s president, Sauli Niinistö, at a press conference. “A protected Finland is being born as part of a stable, strong and responsible Nordic region. We gain security and we also share it. It’s good to keep in mind that security isn’t a zero-sum game.” The prime minister, Sanna Marin, said the proposal would now be sent to parliament for ratification. “Our decision is historic,” she said. “As a member of Nato, we will also be responsible for the security of the alliance as a whole.” With neighbouring Sweden’s ruling party also holding a decisive meeting on whether to join the 30-member defensive alliance next week, Moscow’s onslaught on Ukraine looks set to usher in the expansion of Nato that Vladimir Putin claimed he wanted to prevent. Finland shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia and, like Sweden, has maintained strict policies of neutrality then non-alignment since the end of the second world war, viewing Nato membership as a provocation of Moscow. However, Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February has led to a profound change in its thinking, with public support for Nato accession trebling to about 75%. Polls show a majority of between 50 and 60% are also in favour in Sweden. Three days after Finland’s leaders said it “must apply for Nato membership without delay”, the membership proposal is expected to be laid before parliament for ratification on Monday. Niinistö called his Russian counterpart, Putin, on Saturday and informed him his country aimed to join Nato, in a conversation he described as “direct and straightforward”. He added: “Avoiding tensions was considered important.” Russia has repeatedly warned Finland and Sweden against joining Nato, saying such a move would oblige it to “restore military balance” by strengthening its defences in the Baltic Sea region, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Putin responded to Niinistö’s call by saying Nato membership “would be a mistake, since there is no threat to Finland’s security”, according to a readout of the call released by the Kremlin. After a cross-party Swedish parliamentary review on Friday said joining Nato would boost Sweden’s national security and help stabilise the Nordic region, leaders of the country’s ruling Social Democrats were also poised on Sunday to jettison the party’s longstanding opposition to Nato membership. With a decision expected in the early evening, Swedish media reported that – assuming Helsinki sends its application in on Monday – Stockholm is likely to follow suit as early as Tuesday, with the alliance set to launch the accession process immediately afterwards. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said both countries would be “welcomed with open arms” and that the accession process would be quick, though formal approval by all the alliance’s members could take several months. However, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has expressed his opposition to the move, based on what he said was the countries’ accommodating attitude towards the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), which is on the EU’s list of terrorist organisations. Nato’s deputy secretary general, Mircea Geoană, said on Sunday he was confident Turkey’s concerns over Finland and Sweden joining the alliance could be addressed. “I am confident if these countries decide to seek membership in Nato we will be able to welcome them to find all conditions for consensus to be met,” he said. Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, also said he was “confident” of reaching an agreement with Turkey.",News/World news,Finland formally confirms intention to join Nato,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/finland-formally-confirms-intention-to-join-nato-russia
5/15/2022,"Imagine, for a moment, you’re the goalframe at the east end of Wembley. Last summer, you watched as Marcus Rashford, at the climax of that sulphurous July night, took a straight run-up, stuttered, and then, as Gianluigi Donnarumma fell to your left, dragged his penalty to your right. You like the young man, his obvious decency, his stance on various social issues – and you are an English goalframe after all. You wanted him to score. You tried to just stretch a bit further, to widen your stance, but your feet were rooted and the ball cannoned off the base of your post and away. If only he had struck it three inches more centrally you probably could have helped it in, and if you had, England would probably be European champions and Rashford might not have had such a miserable season; Manchester United might not feel like quite such a faded force in need of desperate reconstitution. On Saturday, César Azpilicueta’s penalty clipped the outside of your left-hand post and went wide, and immediately Thiago Alcântara’s effort nudged the inside of your right-hand post and went in. If either had been three inches the other way, the outcome would have been different and Édouard Mendy’s save from Sadio Mané – the great psychodrama between international teammates, which Jürgen Klopp acknowledged he had needlessly complicated by telling Mané not to go with his usual approach – would have won the final for Chelsea. And had that happened, how different the aftermath would have felt, how different the emotions on Sunday morning. What a sense that goalframe must have of the arbitrariness of human destiny, how life can teeter on a knife edge before taking a decisive plunge in one direction or the other. If Chelsea had won, we would now be talking of a spirit born of adversity – albeit an adversity characteristic of football’s age of high decadence, the crisis of oligarchal funding being turned off when the invasion of a sovereign state on the other side of the continent finally persuades people that merrily lapping up cash from this highly litigious associate of a brutal authoritarian leader might not quite be on. (And as the Cup celebrated its 150th birthday with a bizarre kick-off time, the booing of Abide With Me and a DJ set that obstructed the view from part of the press box, you wonder what Charles W Alcock, the Sunderland-born Old Harrovian whose idea it was, might have made of it all. “Look, Charles, there’s some really good news: your competition will still be going on in 2022. But I have to warn you, it’s moved on a bit – not really a giggle for public schoolboys any more, more a theatre for soft-power gameplaying between petro-states and American capital.”) There might be some grumbling about another duff performance from Romelu Lukaku and the weird striking dearth that meant a 14-minute cameo as an emergency centre-forward from Ruben Loftus-Cheek: how bad must he be at penalties that he had to be withdrawn? And how bad must Ross Barkley, who Thomas Tuchel said was brought on for Loftus-Cheek because of his penalty record, now be in open play that he couldn’t be risked for 14 minutes? But there would have been a sense that the storm had passed, that the foundations remained for the Todd Boehly-led consortium to build on. And for Liverpool there would have been a nagging sense that this season, which could yet in terms of trophies won be the best enjoyed by any club, might end up like a typical Don Revie season at Leeds in the late 60s and early 70s: fatigue-induced near misses, great memories and not much in the trophy cabinet. Klopp acknowledged that winning the league looks unlikely now. And with injury doubts over Fabinho, Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah, the build-up to the Champions League final could only have been pessimistic. Just a League Cup? After playing every possible game this season, after keeping the possibility of a Quadruple alive longer than any side has before? However great the achievement to have come so close, that would have been an extreme disappointment. Sign up for our new and free women’s football newsletter! Liverpool came within inches of defeat – and yet the truth is the final never felt that close. Liverpool may have drawn four times with Chelsea this season, but they are very obviously a better side. In part that is down to Klopp, to his charisma, his organisational skills and the belief he instils. But he also credited neuro11, a German neuroscience company that has been working with Liverpool for more than a year, for the penalty success: the team’s record of 17 scored from 18 attempts in shoot-outs this season suggests he’s right to do so. That is the other side of Klopp. His personality tends to draw most of the attention, but he is also extremely receptive to specialists who can offer a competitive advantage, from neuroscientists to data analysts to throw-in coaches. That’s one of the reasons Liverpool haven’t really made a poor signing since Christian Benteke in 2015. The mentality and the thrilling football have an advanced scientific underpinning. The goalframe, with its awareness of angles, may understand how contingent everything is, how dependent results can be on the fractional movement of a piece of leather. But behind all that lies a great science that helps tweak those margins.

5/15/2022,"This story was published in partnership with The Guardian and The Trace, a non-profit newsroom covering gun violence in America. Sign up for its newsletter here. There’s no such thing as an average day for Nasser “Nash” Baker, but they do tend to start the same way. Most people may know about Baker’s line of work from Nightcrawler, the 2014 film in which Jake Gyllenhaal skulks around Los Angeles to film car crashes and murder scenes. But Baker refers to himself as a “daycrawler”, leaving his home in south Los Angeles every day around noon wearing his bulletproof vest and helmet. Baker usually parks his blue Crown Victoria at a Starbucks in a plaza at the intersection of Western and Slauson avenues, not far from his home, and starts listening to his police scanner and browsing news wires. Inevitably, at some point, he hears three beeps over the scanner and “goes into another zone” as he drives toward the site of a shooting. For more than 20 years, Baker, 49, has covered the aftermath of shootings and police violence in south LA’s historically-Black neighborhoods and cities like Inglewood, Watts and Compton. He works as a stringer for Onscene.tv, a southern California news gathering service from which local outlets buy footage. He also runs A Million Hits, an Instagram account and YouTube channel that have become the go-to source of information on shootings for many Angelenos living in the communities that face the most gun violence. Over the course of Baker’s two-decade long career, his car has been shot up, he has administered first aid to gunshot wound victims and has had police threaten to break his equipment. Unlike Gyllenhaal’s character, he doesn’t salivate when he hears news of a shooting. But he continues to hit the streets daily to report reliable information in communities many other reporters either forget about or overlook, he says, hoping to help keep neighborhoods safe, dispel the rumors that follow homicides and can lead to retaliation, and force police accountability. “Most outlets aren’t writing about what happened on 81st and Figueroa, so the people are using me to verify and fact check so they can do their homework because they know if I say something, it’s backed by an official,” he said. “A Million Hits is here to be the first outlet to record, edit and report our stories. We’re here to film the officer with their knees on people’s necks.” “South LA check-in, South LA check-in.” They are usually Baker’s first words on Instagram as he pulls up to the scene of a shooting. His appearance belies his profession, wearing black-rimmed glasses, dressed in camouflage, and arms toned by more than a decade of holding a professional camera, sometimes for hours as a crime scene unfolds. His helmet and can carry cell phones and holders, a flashlight, a digital police scanner, two GoPro cameras and a backup video camera. He tells his followers what he knows – location, number of people shot, whether anyone’s been taken to the emergency room – and implores those living nearby to check on their loved ones and take their kids inside. His videos come with a healthy dose of commentary, soliciting prayers and answers for a victim’s family, critiquing local police or speaking on the larger scourge of gun violence’s impact on Black Americans. Baker’s profile has grown significantly in recent years, amassing nearly 15,000 YouTube subscribers and over 22,000 Instagram followers, an enviable count for an independent journalist. He was featured in the 2017 Netflix documentary series Shot in the Dark, which focused on the world of videographers who film and sell footage of the aftermaths of car accidents, fires and homicides. Baker’s work intersects with that of others. There are several social media pages solely dedicated to putting out information about gun violence affecting Black people living in American cities, like the Instagram accounts @nogunzone and @unsolvemurdersinphilly in Philadelphia. There are stringers all over the country racing to capture footage of local crime scenes. They have different approaches, goals, motivations, and reliability. But Baker has shaped A Million Hits into its own thing: a reliable source of information on neighborhoods that rarely get the in-depth treatment, with Baker shooting, editing and verifying the footage. It’s made A Million Hits a staple of the news diet of many people living in places like south Los Angeles, Compton and Watts. Many of his followers are families and friends of people who were killed. He now regularly gets calls from people in jail or prison, who ask him what he knows about a recent shooting. He’s happy to take the calls, he says, since they allow him to dispel rumors that have made their way around the streets or prisons and can lead to retaliation. “You have to be a counterweight and can’t let things get too out of control,” Baker said. In addition to making sure verified information is available to the communities where the most shootings occur, Baker has come to see himself as an ardent defender of the first amendment. So much so that he’s gone head to head with police officers to ensure that he can film the aftermath of shooting scenes. He’s filed a complaint against the Los Angeles police department and sued the LA county sheriff’s department over incidents in 2020. Baker alleges that Los Angeles police officers targeted him and photojournalist Nicholas Stern with batons and rubber bullets and unjustly arrested them while covering a protest following the police killing of George Floyd. He also says that later that year, sheriff’s deputies assaulted him while he was filming an interaction between protesters and deputies outside of a hospital where two deputies were being treated for gunshot wounds. One deputy threatened to break his camera, he says. Both the Los Angeles police department and sheriff’s department declined to comment on Baker’s allegations, citing pending litigation. Baker has also worked with the Los Angeles press club to push for the enactment of SB 98, state legislation that makes members of the press exempt from police dispersal orders while they cover demonstrations. “We have to protect our first amendment rights,” Baker said. “I continue to film police and file complaints and lawsuits to make sure our rights will be protected. And that’s something I’m going to pass down through generations. It’s our civil right.” Baker was born in Chicago and grew up in South Central LA in a Muslim family. Growing up, he learned martial arts and prepared the bodies of other Muslims for burial in a process called Ghusl. He undertook the pilgrimage to Mecca, called Hajj, when he was 18. He credits these experiences as the driving force behind his impulse to protect his community and empower people to rely on each other. “We grew up with those values and were trained to help the community,” Baker said. “I was trained to survive in the streets before I started filming them. I had to know the areas and work with the people in them.” He watched high school classmates, and even his brother, become engulfed in gang life and says most of the people he met in high school have been killed or incarcerated for decades. “They were gonna be football or basketball players. Some even went to community college. No one started off just being involved in gun violence,” Baker said. Equally formative were the 1992 LA riots. Baker was about to graduate high school when four Los Angeles police officers were acquitted in the savage beating of Rodney King, and LA neighborhoods rose up. Dozens of businesses were destroyed and 50 people were killed, 10 of them by police. It put into stark focus the pain his community was facing from police violence, over-incarceration, the crack-cocaine epidemic and the gun violence that accompanied all of these phenomena. Before his foray into news, Baker had a successful rap career under the name LA Nash. He got his start in the local press in the early 2000s, doing camera work with other independent journalists who would film police interactions throughout south LA. He got his first press pass when he started working for Ombudsman Press International, a local outlet for the oversight body that investigates claims of misconduct against officials, law enforcement and government contractors. Baker would take photos for the newspaper, conduct video interviews and film police stops and other interactions throughout the city. He knew nothing about stringing and selling footage to local news stations until he was thrust into what he refers to as the worst day of his life. On 19 February 2008, Baker was on a job for the Ombudsman Press in an unincorporated neighborhood of south Los Angeles, when he heard a high-pitched long beep on the scanner, followed by the announcement of an apparent shooting with multiple people injured on Denker Avenue. Back then, Baker’s only equipment was an eight millimeter video camera and the analog police scanner that picked up a few Los Angeles police, county fire and sheriff’s channels. Baker recognized the address the dispatcher on the other end of the device gave as Washington Preparatory high school, the school he graduated from in 1992. “There was a football game going on and by the time I got to the school there was a lot of yelling and screaming,” Baker recalled. “The paramedics were just getting there and it was like a war zone. I didn’t know if there was an active shooter on the loose. I just wanted to come in and help.” He began filming as people were loaded into ambulances and showed the footage to terrified parents who were desperately seeking information about their kids. A reporter noticed what he was doing and suddenly multiple people were coming up to him asking who he was with and how much the ambulance transport footage was going for. From then on, he started filming footage of transports via ambulance or coroner van and detectives as they analyzed a crime scene and sold them on his own. He joined Onscene.tv later that year. At Onscene.tv, he continued to focus on the areas he knew best: South Central, Watts and Compton. Car accidents and fire footage was, and in many cases still is, the bread and butter of stringing for local news, he said. And over the years, news stations would buy shooting footage less and less frequently. Uninterested in covering weather or car crash scenes, he started A Million Hits, which he named after an excerpt from a speech given during the fifth anniversary of the Million Man March in 2000. “I cover urban stuff in my area. I cover what my children would need to know,” Baker said. In March 2019, Baker covered his most high profile shooting yet. He was driving toward Leimert Park, when he heard on the scanner three people had been shot at the intersection of Slauson Avenue and Crenshaw Boulevard, just a u-turn and a few minutes’ drive from where Baker had been. Once he pulled up, he realized the shooting was at the Marathon Store, which was founded by rapper Nipsey Hussle. Baker parked at a nearby donut shop and watched as police taped off the scene, police cars arrived, and a crowd of locals began to gather. No one knew who had been shot until a woman yelled, “Nip!” and the crowd went under the police tape to get answers for themselves. Baker went to the back of the store and saw Hussle’s beard. “That’s when I realized it’ll never be the same around here,” he recalled. Between the protests and the homicide scenes, Baker says he’s seen things so traumatic that he has to leave them at the door before coming home to his two young sons and wife. “My wife strings with me so we have to let out those cries and make sure the stories are edited and published that day. You can’t keep it in. If we hold all these stories in it’s like cancer. We spend most of our time helping so we don’t carry the weight.” Baker met his wife, Mia Robinson, in the Starbucks on Western and Slauson, and they bonded over their shared passion for videography. Robinson went to film her first shooting scene in 2016 and says she, too, has been hooked on stringing ever since. “It’s real, it’s almost like you feel alive for the first time and you realize that gun violence is real and it’s breaking up families,” she said of her time as a videographer. “You’re tapping into a world that, if you look, is right under your feet, but people don’t pay attention.” They both worry about each other’s safety in the field but say they see how much the people who live where gun violence is concentrated value A Million Hits. To soothe her anxieties, Robinson surprised Baker with an upgraded bulletproof vest as a Christmas gift. The couple hopes A Million hits will eventually be able to compete with other local outlets and stand out as a site specifically for the communities where gun violence happens most. “One of the benefits of A Million Hits is that I have my videos on both sides, the social media and the news, but we work to serve people who need to know what happened to their loved one,” Baker said. “I don’t need a major endorsement from anyone to do this because this is the area I grew up in.” “I hope that he can turn his brand into a real network and be that outlet people go to instead of having to go to channel seven. He can be that credible voice,” Robinson echoed. Over the years, Baker has seen the communities he covers, and the gun violence within them, evolve. In his teens and early adulthood, nearly everyone he knew was affiliated with a gang, he said. As years passed, those people either died or were locked up in prison. “Gang life is what it was out there. Whether it’s prison or more violence. They both begin with a gun in LA. There was no other tool people would use to solve their issues,” he said of the 1990s. Since then, south LA has transformed from a place that was once primarily associated with violence and crime by people living outside of its neighborhoods and suffered from the disinvestment that comes with this perception to one that is rapidly gentrifying, he says. For more than a decade, gun violence in Los Angeles has decreased exponentially, as has the Black population in communities where they were once sequestered due to the racist housing policies of the mid-20th century. “We were losing people in South Central LA, and this is the first time people are moving back and walking their dogs,” Baker said of how he’s seen the area change. “No one even cared about what was happening back then but some of us never left.” And even as he’s seen rents and property increase and news businesses emerge he says that gun violence has been a stubborn constant for south LA natives. “Black folks have to realize that we’ve done … so much violence has happened among us, I think that going forward it’ll be hard to curb,” he continued. For South Central natives like Tina Sampay, Baker has been a go-to outlet for years. She started following A Million Hits from the early days to keep up with what was happening in her hometown while she was away at college in northern California. “He was the only one doing that type of work within South Central and other inner-cities,” she said. “I would hear about shootings here and there but It was hard to find [more] information. But, Nash was the one who had his boots on the ground and was going to these places.” Since coming back to Los Angeles, Sampay has founded her own news media outlet under the name Slauson Girl, gaining nearly 40,000 Instagram followers with daily news posts about topics ranging from celebrities to local crime and politics. She first met Baker when she was driving through her neighborhood and came across a shooting scene where Baker was also filming, and hopes that Baker will become an outlet of record and play an integral role in the larger Black media ecosystem in LA county. “For the level of work he has done, he should be compensated and have his own van and production space,” Sampay continued about Baker. “If we as Black media are not able to compete at the same level as other journalists with more resources then we’ll have to keep allowing people to exploit our communities for views.”",News/US news,South LA’s ‘daycrawler’: the man who’s captured the aftermath of gun violence for 20 years,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/15/a-million-hits-la-gun-violence-california
5/15/2022,"Well this is a treat. A new building that is serious and responsible – the Keir Starmer virtues, you could say; adjectives that might be synonyms for dull – that is also sumptuous and surprising, that takes delight in the things that architecture is made of, in materials, space, light and craft. Which is a touch strange and wilful. That takes the risk of looking weird and is rewarded with being beautiful. This is the new dining hall of Homerton College, Cambridge, built by Barnes Construction of Suffolk and designed by Feilden Fowles – Fergus Feilden and Edmund Fowles – under-40-year-old architects with several accomplished works to their name, in particular in historic and sensitive settings such as Carlisle Cathedral and Yorkshire Sculpture Park. They have sometimes looked as if they were becoming an unimpeachably safe and careful practice of a kind that this country periodically produces. This building, though, is bold. Homerton, formerly dedicated to training teachers, has only been a full Cambridge college since 2010, and now offers all subjects of the university’s tripos. It is literally on the wrong side of the tracks, reached via a busy road bridge over the railway lines into Cambridge station. Although the college itself stands in pleasant grounds, its neighbourhood lacks the punts and willows and venerable architecture for which the city is famous. These “perceived minuses”, says Geoff Ward, Homerton’s recently retired principal, are actually “pluses”. It is near the biomedical campus where the likes of AstraZeneca have their headquarters, which creates the possibility of collaboration. The college also has the most diverse intake of any in the university. It offers “a Cambridge education without the Cambridge stereotypes”, was how one student explained its attraction. So its new £10.4m building has to project the confidence of a newly transformed institution and cater to its growing student numbers, while embodying an open and unstuffy spirit. The college has an older dining hall, which will now be used for receptions and functions and suchlike, in a wannabe neo-gothic that tries too hard to emulate the interiors of the ancient colleges. It is a dark and suffocating place, with the soul of overcooked meat and gravy. It is introverted. The new space, while using the rectangular plan and timber vault of a traditional hall, is both light and full of light. Glazed openings run along one side, giving generous views into lush gardens. The opposite side opens into humbler spaces, a server and a kitchen beyond, and an informal cafe. The pitched roof of an old-fashioned hall is inverted into a big extruded V of a ceiling, which rises on each side to allow high bands of glazing. Where once there would have been massive oak beams, engineers Structure Workshop have here devised a structure of pale X shapes, manufactured from sweet chestnut coppice, with all the skinniness that modern technology allows. The timber is held together with interlocking joints and wooden pegs, without any steel bolts or plates, which brings some benefit in terms of sustainability. It is also an example of the sort of unasked-for thoughtfulness in which the building abounds. The wooden panelling of the walls gently corrugates to catch light and shadow. The floor is in shades of grey-green terrazzo in a strong pattern of pointy triangles, subtly complementary to the mulberry-pink concrete that frames the openings to the garden. The colours and shapes quietly zing off one another. The openness and consideration of the design extends to the kitchens, light-filled and well-organised and visually connected both to surrounding spaces and the outside. A big glass wall on the cafe faces back towards the gable of an older college building, such that it becomes the backdrop of the interior. Every element, historic or functional, has its dignity. But what really gives the building oomph is its exterior. Here the V-shaped ceiling is expressed as an M-shaped gable at either end of a big box, entirely clad in green faience. The material is mottled and aqueous, always shifting with light and angle of view, catching shadows and bouncing reflections. Flat though it is, it invites you to gaze into its depths. On the building’s flanks the faience is shaped into a shallow relief of thin vertical triangular shapes, designed to echo a small copper spire on top of the college’s old dining hall. These triangles extend into tall, vertical fins at the top of the elevation, framing the glass panels of the hall’s high-level windows. The whole is placed on a satisfyingly substantial base in that pinkish concrete, where students are invited to sit on built-in benches in its deep openings. Round the back is something else again, a handsome brick structure containing the kitchens. For the sheer joy of materials, the dining hall is hard to beat: the play of flat and sculpted, matt and shiny, pink and green, the angular faience and rounded shadows formed in the concrete concavities. The way that the superstructure stands on its low base, contrasting in almost every respect, arguably out of proportion, is borderline awkward, but it’s all the more arresting for that. If you wanted to quibble with the architecture you might say that it’s slightly precious and un-radical, a tiny bit complacent in its Cambridge bubble, but you’d have to be in a mean mood to make much of that. The design also does something to your perception. The exterior cladding makes the building look more solid and opaque than it is, the extensive glazing at the topbarely noticeable amid all the greenish shiny stuff, with the vertical fins hiding the glass in oblique views. This makes the fragility of the interior surprising. What the Tardis does with size the dining hall does with mass: it resembles a big glazed brick on the outside, a balsa wood biplane within, yet these two characters somehow come together to make the same building. There is, in other words, paradox and inversion. What you see is not what you get. This quality makes the dining hall more than an exercise in good details and well-chosen finishes. It engages your mind and senses. It makes weight and light more palpable. It invites you to understand it through moving round it. By refusing to settle on a single reading, by keeping you guessing as to what precisely it is, the architecture’s ambiguity inoculates it against both grandiosity and blandness. Architecture gets asked to carry many loads. It is expected to be sustainable and socially virtuous, to be accessible and sensitive to historic settings. Which is as it should be, as it’s a public art, a setting for people’s lives, but in all the concern about doing good, what can be overlooked is what actually makes buildings enjoyable, and what the skills and arts of an architect can contribute. These might be summarised as doing stuff with stuff, as composing the necessary minerals and volumes of a building in such a way that you are moved, provoked and engaged, and that the experience of whatever it is that goes on in and around it is heightened. Homerton College’s dining hall does right and proper things by the environment and its users. It’s also an architectural pleasure.",Arts/Art and design,"Homerton College, Cambridge dining hall: good enough to eat in",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/15/homerton-college-cambridge-university-new-dining-hall-feilden-fowles-good-enough-to-eat-in
5/15/2022,"Fonthill Abbey in Wiltshire is one of the great lost wonders of British architecture, a neo-gothic giant with cathedral-sized interiors, built from 1796 to 1813, whose 90-metre tower collapsed and was rebuilt several times. It fell for the last time in 1825, since when the rest of the building has all but disappeared. It also takes its place in Queer Spaces: An Atlas of LGBTQIA+ Places and Stories, alongside clubs, bars, railway carriages, bookshops, community centres, public parks, private houses and a Castro-era ice-cream parlour in Havana. Fonthill Abbey was built for his own use by an exceptionally wealthy man, William Beckford, whose prospective career in public life was ended when he was outed as a “sodomite”. He “consoled his unhappiness”, as the book puts it, by building his fantastical house, where he longed “for a ‘beatific vision’ in which a beautiful angelic youth would come forth from the heavens to embrace him with love and understanding”. As conspicuous as it was, its main purpose was to shelter him from a hostile world, creating instead a private internal universe of mirrors, stained glass, “lustrous multicoloured objets d’art” and carefully framed views out to the surrounding landscape. Queer Spaces is edited by Adam Nathaniel Furman, an architecturally trained artist and designer well known for his taste-busting adventures in colour and decoration, and Joshua Mardell, an architectural historian. Together they have invited more than 50 contributors – film-makers, artists, planners, activists, urban geographers, researchers, writers – to choose and write about queer spaces that mean something to them. Each place gets a spread or two of words and images to communicate what makes them special. Examples come from all over the world – Italian villas where European aristocrats photographed local youths, the Oddbird theatre in New Delhi, the Today x Future bar in the Philippines – and there is absolutely no conformity of appearance. Some are conventional places made queer only by the lives led inside them, such as working-class houses and pubs in Sheffield or the Guildford hotel in Leeds, which unwittingly hosted, in 1974, a seminal conference on what was then called “transsexualism”. Some are purpose-designed to celebrate their queerness. Some are transitory, some permanent, some – like the zoom-based Queer House Party – virtual more than physical. Within an orderly graphic layout, the book offers a riotous array of imagery, one that includes more actual human beings than the average book on architecture. Yet certain themes recur. One is interiority, the need and desire, as at Fonthill, to create inner worlds protected from external aggression and misunderstanding. Others are ingenuity and subversion, as in the earthquake-damaged cathedral in Managua which, deemed unsafe for worshippers, was from 1972 to 1990 “an ‘underground’ home for queer communities”. “A defining characteristic of queer space,” one contributor writes, “is its deformation, subversion and appropriation of space.” Another recurring theme is a free and transgressive attitude to the conventions of architecture and construction. A star of the book is Finella, a house in Cambridge where, between the wars, the gay English don Mansfield Duval Forbes conjured an interior out of wired glass panels backed by silver leaf, copper Plymax and yellow silk. Finella promiscuously mixed gothic, classical, modern and Chinese motifs, somehow to conjure the palace of the legendary Scottish queen after whom the house was named. Many of the works show a different attitude to eternity from the architecture you get in conventional history books. The Cave of Harmony, a cabaret club in 1920s London, migrated around three locations in eight years. Fonthill Abbey, monumental as it was, wasn’t really built to last. Queer Spaces has an acknowledged debt to a book of almost the same name, Queer Space, published in 1997 by the American architecture critic Aaron Betsky, which broke new ground by treating the architecture of same-sex desire as a subject of architectural-historical study. The older book is analytical and focused, developing arguments as it goes. The new one is looser and broader, with a wider definition of “queer” than Betsky’s. Queer Spaces is generous in range and rich in creativity. It doesn’t try to draw conclusions, just to offer examples of what Furman calls “spaces where you can act freely in a manner that is truly consonant with your inner self”. Which, really, is a fair definition of what all architecture should achieve.

5/15/2022,"Close your eyes for three seconds, Dr Stephanie Cacioppo instructs me early in our conversation. You might like to do the same at home, or on the train, or wherever you are. Now think of the person that you love most in the world. Got them? Remember the last time you made them laugh out loud. One-two-three. “Did that bring a smile to your face?” asks Cacioppo, a neuroscientist at the University of Chicago, who specialises on the impact of love on the brain, and is the author of a new book, Wired for Love. It did. “It works all the time,” she goes on. “It’s because of this fantastic wiring we have in our brain that activates the love network, but also the mirror neuron system. That’s the neuro system that is activated when you move, but also when you anticipate or think about the actions or emotions of others. So imagining someone smiling, it’s like activating your own smile as well.” Dr Cacioppo suggests the exercise might be useful for astronauts, who can spend months away from their loved ones on a space station. It could also come in handy, say, during a global pandemic that makes us housebound for the better part of two years. But the memory game has a personal resonance for Cacioppo, who is 47 and has a big smile and rolling wave of platinum-blonde hair. In March 2018 her partner, Dr John Cacioppo, a social neuroscientist who was a pioneer of research into loneliness, died unexpectedly, aged 66. Theirs had, in some ways, been an unlikely relationship: not least because it brought together two experts who had been christened in the media as Dr Love and Dr Loneliness. When they met in January 2011 at a neuroscience research symposium in Shanghai, she was in her mid-30s and he was in his late-50s; both were adamant they were not looking for a partner. But in less than a year, they were married and inseparable. They worked inches apart at one desk and shared an office at the University of Chicago with “The Cacioppos” on the door. They came at their research from opposite ends of the spectrum, but both passionately believed that the human need for social connection was as essential to a person’s wellbeing as clean water, nutritious food or exercise. So, when Stephanie Cacioppo closes her eyes, she sees John. “Love is a biological necessity. We cannot live without it,” she says. “And that’s hard to say for someone who lost their best friend, their soul mate, and the love of their life. But I realised that love does not have to be with the person who is physically here with you. Like we mentioned with the astronaut, we can be in love with someone even if they live far away from you. Or even if they passed away; we lost so many people in our lives during Covid and I think many people can relate to that. “One key to keeping John’s love alive was actually to realise that he was gone, and to face the pain that he was not physically here,” Cacioppo goes on. “And once I let go, once I really faced that pain, I saw him everywhere, all around me. In different ways I could feel his love and I still really feel his love everywhere. That was beautiful for me and I hope that can inspire people to feel connected and not lonely.” Wired for Love: a Neuroscientist’s Journey Through Romance, Loss and the Essence of Human Connection is very much not the book that Cacioppo expected to write. She has spent her career attempting to prove that love was a worthy subject of scientific study (she received strong pushback on this idea from other researchers who considered it a primitive impulse, almost an addiction). Her work was evidence-based: she conducted electroencephalogram (EEG) tests to track electrical signals produced by the brain and functional MRI scanning techniques to delineate between love and lust. Understanding love was about science, not stories or, heaven forfend, poetry. It was an important time for an in-depth analysis of love, Cacioppo felt. By several parameters, humans appear to be experiencing less love, and more loneliness, than ever before. Marriage rates for opposite-sex couples have been in steady decline in the UK since the 1970s. In 2018, the Office for National Statistics reported that they were the lowest ever recorded. Despite the proliferation of dating apps, we seem to be having less sex than ever. In 2018, nearly a quarter of Americans – again, another record – said they had no sexual encounters in the previous year. Among the factors believed to contribute to this “sex drought” are smartphones, the gig economy, open-plan offices (perhaps counterintuitively) and more people living in cities. But when Cacioppo came to work on her serious science book, details of her own relationship with John kept bobbing to the surface. As she wrote them down, she began to realise that she had never told even her closest friends most of what happened in their rollercoaster, seven-year relationship. “Sharing that story was really excruciating,” she says, “because it’s really against my nature. I’m a shy and private person, but I felt like it was kind of a mission for me to conquer my shyness and share my story and the science behind my story with the readers. The hope being that it will help people not only appreciate more the beauty and the nature of human connections, but also perhaps find love and maintain love in their own life.” The strange truth is that romantic love has been elusive for Dr Love for most of her life. Growing up in the outskirts of Chambéry in the French Alps, Stephanie Ortigue was the only child of passionate French-Italian parents who set a dauntingly high bar for what a relationship should look and feel like. To avoid feeling like a gooseberry, she threw herself first into tennis and then science. “I didn’t understand why I was born an only child,” says Cacioppo, who now lives in Oregon, in a house near some woods with her dog, a shar-pei called Bacio. “I thought that just because of that, that was my fate: I was born alone, I will die alone. Typical romantic, French dramatic. And on top of that, my dear Italian grandmother told me to dress up nicely every day just in case that was the last day of our life. So my attitude was: I live as if I were going to die tomorrow and I enjoy life as if I am going to live forever. “On top of that, I had my parents displaying this beautiful, perfect relationship that seems quite honestly unattainable. But it was inspiring and I love challenges. So I don’t take impossible as an answer and I always thought that maybe one day…” Cacioppo didn’t have serious boyfriends as a teenager or in college, and in her 20s she threw herself into her research, initially at the Geneva University Hospital and then Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. One of her early findings was that romantic love seemed to activate 12 specific brain regions. Some of these were not a big surprise: Cacioppo expected it to fire up the so-called “emotional” brain and the dopamine-hungry “reward” system. What was unexpected was that passionate love – distinct from friendship or maternal love – also triggered some of the most sophisticated, higher-order regions of the brain. One in particular: the angular gyrus. The angular gyrus, which is found tucked behind the ear, was developed relatively recently in our evolutionary history (only apes and humans have it). It is generally linked to abstract thought and language; photos of Einstein’s brain have shown that this area was unusually large. For Cacioppo, the discovery was proof that “love played a more complex role in the brain than anyone could have reasonably guessed”. Her research also showed that, while we might believe that how we experienced love was unique, what was happening on a biological level was pretty much identical for all of us. “Regardless of where you were born, whether you were gay or straight, male, female, transgendered, if a person – or persons – were significant to you, they can light up this network in the same essential way,” Cacioppo writes in Wired for Love. It was groundbreaking work, but for Cacioppo personally, love remained a theoretical concept. That changed at the conference in Shanghai in 2011. She has no doubt that “love at first sight” exists and there is scientific research to back it up: directeye-to-eye contact has been shown to spark activity in that core area of the angular gyrus. “I felt really fulfilled in a way, at that time,” recalls Cacioppo. “And I genuinely thought I was happy until I met my husband, who really proved me wrong! I was happier with him than ever before.” In the beginning, John Cacioppo, who had been married twice before, was the more wary of the pair. After their first meeting, with him back in Chicago and her in Geneva, it was Stephanie who sent the follow-up message. “I’ve always been a fiercely independent woman, but yes, I did send that email,” she says. “And I’m really glad I did. Because his prefrontal cortex – what I call ‘the parents in the brain’ – was more dominant than his intuition, or the part of his mind that felt like his heart. So I don’t think he would ever have sent an email.” The Cacioppos’ relationship moved fast, and in many ways they felt like they had the blessing of the science. Stephanie’s research suggested there were significant mental and physical benefits to being in love: rather than being distracted, people in love can benefit from the explosion of activity in their angular gyrus and be more creative and motivated. Likewise, data from one of John’s studies found that chronic loneliness increases the odds of an early death by 20%. This was about the same impact as being obese – “though obesity does not make you as miserable as loneliness”, John Cacioppo told the Observer in 2016. “We joked about Dr Loneliness meeting Dr Love, but the title didn’t really play a role in our relationship,” she says. “But our science really was part of our life: we tried to apply our science to everyday to make sure that Dr Love and Dr Loneliness will have this lasting love and will be happy ever after.” Theirs was not an uncomplicated coupling. In 2015, John was diagnosed with a rare form of salivary gland cancer; he had to undergo aggressive chemotherapy and radiation treatment, and for months was fed through a tube. But he recovered well enough to return to full-time teaching. His appetite came back and he rebuilt his depleted body with daily exercise sessions. Eventually, he was told by doctors that he had “turned another corner”, but soon afterwards he started coughing violently. The cancer had spread to his lungs. In Wired for Love, Cacioppo is unsparing about the impact her husband’s death had on her: she was depressed, unsure that “a meaningful life” was still possible. Today, she is still clearly raw, but defiant. “When you go through all these emotions, like I did, you feel like the passenger of your life, rather than the driver of your life,” she says. “And this is really disturbing in a way, because you really don’t know what’s happening. “But I’m a living proof of my science; I survived partly thanks to it,” Cacioppo continues. “That’s why I want to share it with readers; I want to share that experience and all the tricks and drills of the mind. And help them understand how the brain works, so then they can regain control of their own brain and feel that they are in charge of their emotions, rather than being the victim of their emotions.” The first stage of recovery for Cacioppo was exercise. She ran six miles a day (a 20-minute daily walk will also help) and realised she was happiest when she was helping others. “Losing my husband was a huge mental shower,” she says. “I really understood what was important in life – and it’s not me. I used to be an only child, always spoiled and the centre of attention, at least for my Italian grandmother. But now I see there is something bigger than me and it’s very humbling.” One of the great challenges for our society, says Cacioppo, is tackling loneliness. It’s an invidious problem, but there are strategies that can help. “The worst thing you can do to a lonely person is try to help them,” she notes in Wired for Love. “If you know somebody who’s lonely, ask them to help you. Being shown respect, being depended upon, being made to understand your own importance – all these things can give a lonely person a sense of worth and belonging.” Even the simple exercise we started the article with can reduce feelings of isolation. “Understanding that our brain is our best friend,” says Cacioppo, “that we can really stay connected with others just with the power of our mind, just by imagining them with us right now, that will also help people feel less lonely.” As for what’s next for Cacioppo, personally and professionally, she’s not sure. “I’ll talk to my dog and see what she thinks about it,” she says, with a giggle. But then she turns more serious. “If there is one take-home message from my story, it doesn’t come from me, it comes from Maya Angelou, who beautifully wrote, ‘Have enough courage to trust love one more time and always one more time.’” Wired for Love by Dr Stephanie Cacioppo is published by Little, Brown at £20, or buy a copy from guardianbookshop.com for £17.40",News/Science,‘We cannot live without love’: when Dr Love met Dr Loneliness,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/15/we-cannot-live-without-love-what-happened-when-dr-love-met-dr-loneliness
5/15/2022,"Never a director known for his gentle handling of an audience, Gaspar Noé applies the cinematic thumbscrews with his latest picture, in some ways his most punishing film to date. It’s also a world away, stylistically, from the bold, synapse-sizzling aesthetic of films such as Enter the Void and Climax. A painfully bleak portrait of an elderly couple at the end of their lives, Vortex is brutally matter-of-fact about the indignities of old age. The film’s one concession to Noé’s normally showy directing style is a split-screen device, used to convey the disengagement and disorientation of dementia – the wife (Françoise Lebrun) struggles to recognise her husband and anxiously prowls their labyrinthine Parisian apartment, hoping to find an anchor of familiarity. The husband (neither character is named) is a petulant intellectual, played by the writer-director Dario Argento. He views his wife’s deterioration as an inconvenience. There’s a despairing inevitability to the film’s incremental pacing – we feel every aching minute of the nearly two-and-a-half-hour running time.

5/15/2022,"In this atone age – the age of looking sceptically at old assumptions – the American musical is coming in for scrutiny. It is hard to imagine a show being more effectively rethought than Daniel Fish and Jordan Fein’s Broadway production of Oklahoma!. All around the pale wood set designed by Laura Jellinek and Grace Laubacher, guns hang above the heads of the audience, who face each other on either side of the stage, as if ready for hoedown – or mow-down. Daniel Kluger’s reorchestration has stripped away lushness from the music, which is played by an onstage string band: country-twanging, roaring into rock, making a chorus sound less like a cowboy whoop than a war cry, yet capable of melting into intimacy with People Will Say We’re in Love. Being a no-disguise production, for much of the evening the house lights are up, but Scott Zielinski’s lighting plunges the action into total darkness for some disturbing encounters and turns the air an eerie turquoise at fantasy time. The hopeful young couple Curly and Laurey are last seen in wedding clothes, spattered with blood. The killing that prompts that ending has been altered, made still more sinister, yet in general it is not simple change but re-emphasis that makes this Oklahoma! feel so new, together with finely recalibrated central performances. As Jud, the isolated hired hand, Patrick Vaill haunts the action, onstage throughout, casting an outsider stare on any hints at traditional dress-swishing, chap-slapping, pizzicato-pony-trotting jollity. Arthur Darvill’s Curly and Anoushka Lucas’s Laurey are less wholesome than sexy and taunting. The triumph is in showing that the buoyancy is not separate from darker aspects but dependent on them. There is subtlety from Liza Sadovy – fresh from Cabaret success – and fine, dim-wit deadpan from James Davis. And lusciousness. Marisha Wallace’s glorious voice summons admirers like a bell, turning I Cain’t Say No from a comic sideshow into an anthem. Every now and then there is a shade of self-consciousness, of working too hard on pressing a point, but the detail is unflagging. The corn cobs alone are worth a thesis: being prepared for a picnic, they are greedily torn apart by one woman, carefully dissected by another. Oh, and waved around like phalluses. Rebuilding is the theme of this year’s Brighton festival, co-curated by the Syrian architect Marwa al-Sabouni and Tristan Sharps, artistic director of the Brighton-based site-responsive company dreamthinkspeak. Al-Sabouni has created a colonnade venue on the front – the Riwaq, a pop-up space that hovers between inside and out. Meanwhile Sharps’s Unchain Me weaves in and out of city buildings, aiming to look at the need for reconstruction of inner lives and social structures. If only the result were as dynamic as the company’s dazzling reimagining of Hamlet 10 years ago. Unchain Me takes off from Dostoevsky’s The Possessed, in which a revolutionary band with an unstable leader wreaks havoc in a town. Here the plot involves a struggle for the heart of Brighton. A wicked boss figure, the Governess, running the city for personal profit, is challenged by a group determined that decisions should be taken by “the people”; but is their own leader reliable? The audience – treated as potential recruits, and as vulnerable to dangerous influences – are divided into groups, and set off on different routes with the same destination. Each follows instructions on iPads (with warnings about infiltrators) and guidance by “activists” who lead them around the Pavilion gardens, through an underground tunnel (where a locked door is labelled “foul linen store”), past locked-up museum display cases (described as “plundered artefacts”) and finally into the courthouse for a reckoning between Governess and opponents. Every now and then you stop for a lecture: from the activists about governmental failures, or to hear from an undercover cop about the activists’ unreliability. The menace level is low. The speeches are stilted. The geography is insufficiently startling: at times it feels as if you are just doing 10,000 theatrical steps. Most damagingly, the audience, constantly herded and harangued, seem to have the power of interaction and curiosity sucked from them. The intention is presumably to raise questions about compliance and resistance: which path would you take? Yet the alternatives are posed so doggedly, and tendentiously, as to drain away curiosity. Only the final scene flickers with dreamthinkspeak’s customary illuminations. Brought together in one room, the audience watch videos of actors/activists delivering accounts of radicalisation. Behind them, windows look on to the Brighton streets and unsuspecting civilians. Silently, actors appear in their frames, like monochrome spectres brought to full life. Everyone is being watched. Beru Tessema’s perceptive first play has a troubled centre, bouncing dialogue, a bright, realistic design (jammed windows on a council estate) by Frankie Bradshaw, and a striking performance from newly graduated Michael Workeye, who gangles across the stage, hitching up his trousers, spilling out his rap, halfway between awkwardness and command. The plot of House of Ife – triggered by the death of a young man partly estranged from his family – unfolds unevenly, sometimes overexplicitly, but it has a particular new edge made apparent in Lynette Linton’s vivacious production. The family is divided between Addis Ababa and London; each is looking for a life that includes the experience of both countries. And, literally, a language. Has Amharic, so often heard in London shops and streets, ever been heard before on the English stage? It has now.

5/15/2022,"Along time ago in a galaxy far, far away (pre-Brexit that is), I was vaguely involved in British politics. One thing that always stood out for me was how people from both main parties would often complain that British politics was very drab. They always meant in comparison to the US variety – with its higher production values that mirrored television long before Donald Trump turned it into a grim reality show. Among the reasons for our political glamour deficit are the limits on how much parties can spend on campaigns (£30,000 per constituency) and what they can spend it on (TV advertisements are banned). But people in Westminster should get over their dreams of reliving The West Wing, because it’s a small price to pay for ensuring money doesn’t play an even bigger role in our politics. Those needing further convincing should read new research that examines the impact of spending limits in mayoral elections in Brazil. Areas with more stringent limits attracted more candidates (a 25% lower spending cap resulted in 9% more candidates) and saw fewer incumbents re-elected. Some (idiots) defend high spending limits by arguing that political candidates raising funds from their fellow citizens is key to the cut and thrust of democracy. But is that what actually happens? The Brazilian research work shows that winners in the high spending cap regions did have more cash. But where did the money come from? Themselves. Allowing more money into our politics would be a very dangerous game. You’ve got to keep the spending limits down to keep the oligarchs out.

5/15/2022,"Strawberries and asparagus are, for me, forever charged with the optimism of a full spring and a long summer that’s bound to arrive at any moment. They grow locally where I grew up in Kent. I understand the asparagus puritan who likes their stems no other way but in a slick of salty melted butter right now, but I like to try new things. This recipe is basically a soft garlic sauce; good enough to want to sponge up any remainder with bread. There is also cucumber and fresh chilli – a nod to the summer to come. The strawberries also deserve a clear approach and few things scream summer like a decadent strawberry cream cake. A word on the rainbow chard and mozzarella: I can’t eat these without thinking of the time I spent as a rookie chef in Sydney. Happy sunburnt days they were. The lemony crème fraîche with melting mozzarella is all ooze and zing, wrapped up in a colourful, earthy package. Great as antipasto or a complete dish with a tomato and oregano salad. Serves 4 rainbow chard leaves 8, medium-sizedmozzarella 500gcrème fraîche or thick double cream 8 tsplemon 1, zestedsea salt and black pepperolive oil Split the chard down the centre of the stem, from the middle of the leaf. Blanch in boiling salted water for 2 minutes and remove with a slotted spoon. Slice the mozzarella into 16 pieces. Heat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Open out a chard leaf and place a slice of mozzarella in the middle. Top with a teaspoon of crème fraîche, and a sprinkle of salt, pepper and lemon zest. Place another piece of cheese on top and wrap the leaf around, tucking the stalks under. Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet and repeat with the other leaves. Bake for 8 minutes, then sprinkle with salt, pepper and olive oil. Eat while still warm. This sauce is really quite gentle despite the whole garlic, relying solely on the acidity of the yoghurt. As soon as the season permits, I will swap asparagus with fresh tomatoes and grilled peppers. Serves 4 garlic 1 whole headsalt and pepperthyme 6 fresh sprigsfull-fat yoghurt 150mlolive oilred chillies 4, largeasparagus 250gcucumber 1, mediumblack olives 50ggreen olives 50g Heat the oven to 150C/gas mark 2. Cut the head of garlic in 2, so that the cloves resemble halves of an orange for juicing. Lightly season with salt, lay across 2 of the thyme sprigs, close the garlic back up and wrap in tinfoil. Roast for 50 minutes. With a stick, or other blender, blitz the garlic cloves, squeezed from the skins, the yoghurt, a pinch of salt and 4 good tbsp of olive oil. This makes the dressing. Over the medium flame of a gas burner, or in a dry pan on a medium-high heat, blister the skins of the chillies all over. Cover and set aside to steam until they are cool enough to peel. Then split and scoop out and discard the seeds with a teaspoon. Lightly salt the chilli flesh, dress with olive oil and then wash your hands well. Increase the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Wash the asparagus, trim or snap the hard end off, and cut in half. Peel the cucumber and split in 4 lengthways. Use the point of the knife to remove and discard the seedy part, and cut into chunks. Place the asparagus and cucumber side by side on a baking sheet, sprinkle with salt and olive oil and bake for 15 minutes. Add the olives halfway through. On a serving plate, mix the warm vegetables and chillies, and dress with the garlic sauce. Pick over the remaining thyme leaves and season with cracked black pepper. A simple recipe with so much to give. This is best with a thick fillet of fish. Unlike traditional salt cod, this is seasoned shortly before cooking. Serves 4 cod 800g filletfine sea salt 60gsugar 10ggarlic 1 cloveolive oilpine nuts 25gdried chilli 1basil 2 sprigsplum tomatoes 2, from a tin An hour ahead of cooking, sprinkle the cod fillet all over with the salt and sugar and set aside on a tray for 45 minutes. Then wash well, pat dry and place to one side. Slice the garlic and place in a pan with 2 tbsp of olive oil, the pine nuts and chilli. Fry over a medium heat until the garlic is slightly sticky. Add the fish, basil and torn tomatoes. Add ½ a cup of water, turn to a simmer and cover with a lid. Baste from time to time as it cooks. Check for doneness at about 10 minutes: it is ready when the cod yields to a fork. Serve with bread. You can make the feather-light pan di spagna cake a day ahead. If you want to avoid grappa, use lemon juice on the strawberries instead. Serves 6 butter for the paneggs 3saltcaster sugar 90gvanilla pod seeds of ½, or ½ tsp vanilla extractpotato flour 45g (or cornflour)‘00’ flour 45g (pasta flour)strawberries 400gsugar 2 tbspgrappa 5 tbspdouble cream 500mllemon zest of ½icing sugar for dusting Heat oven to 160C/gas mark 3. To make the sponge, line and grease a 20cm cake pan. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt on a medium-high speed. Once fluffy, add the caster sugar, spoon by spoon, and then the vanilla. Keep on whisking for 15 minutes. This seems like ages, but by the end the eggs will be very thick and stable. Turn off the whisk and sieve over the flours and gently fold in, until completely incorporated. Fill the pan and bake for 45 minutes without opening the door. Then turn the oven off and crack the door open and allow the cake to cool in the oven for 15 minutes. Wash, hull and slice the strawberries thinly. In a bowl, sprinkle them with the 2 tbsp sugar and grappa and stir with a spoon. Set aside for 30 minutes. Whisk the cream with the lemon zest. Slice the cake in two and drench the bottom half with the juice from the bottom of the strawberry bowl and half of the fruit. Cover with as much cream as seems practical, then add the top of the cake and a dusting of icing sugar. Serve with the remaining cream and strawberries.
