3/26/2022,"Jurors who sat on the Zachary Rolfe murder trial in the supreme court of the Northern Territory might be feeling cheated. A week after the not-guilty verdict came down, the court lifted more than two dozen suppression orders that had kept from the jury information about the alleged previous conduct of the accused. This was “tendency evidence” that Justice John Burns ruled would prejudice the jury if made available during the trial of Rolfe on charges relating to the death of Kumanjayi Walker. His defence team successfully argued that his alleged history within the NT police was not admissible as evidence, in part because no findings of wrongdoing had been made against Rolfe in relation to four allegedly violent arrests, and because a judge agreed they were not directly relevant to the shooting death of Walker. The suppressed information included statements by a NT magistrate in another case that Rolfe had lied about what happened during an arrest of Alice Springs man Malcolm Ryder. Judge Greg Borchers found that Rolfe lacked credibility and had injured Ryder by punching him in the face and deliberately banging his head on the floor – injuries that required 16 stitches. Unfortunately, Rolfe hadn’t turned on his body camera, claiming that the device was relatively new in Alice Springs and his “muscle memory hadn’t developed”. Fortunately, another’s officer’s body camera was on and showed, contrary to Rolfe’s evidence, that Ryder had not tried to hit anyone at the time of his arrest. In April 2019, it is alleged that after a chase he banged another young man’s head into a rock, again requiring stitches, and again his body camera was not activated. In October that year, there was an allegation that the police officer pushed a man into a wall, resulting in nine stitches to a bleeding head. An encounter the previous month saw Wayne Spencer hospitalised after being chased by Rolfe and allegedly pushed with full force into a barricade. The prosecution at the trial for the murder of Kumanjayi Walker wanted evidence of these events involving violence included in the proceedings so they could argue that Rolfe had a tendency to use excessive force and to lie in justifying his conduct. There were also text messages from the police officer to his army pals, sent in February and July 2019, that the prosecution sought to have admitted, arguing they gave insights into his attitude towards policing. Alice Springs he described as a “shit hole” … like the “wild west” … with “fuck all … rules in the job”. When he was deployed with a tactical squad it was possible to do “cowboy stuff with no rules”. Rolfe’s barrister, David Edwardson QC, argued that the tendency evidence was “misconceived and unsubstantiated”. He maintained there were significant differences because the Walker case involved the use of a gun, whereas the other incidents didn’t. In January, three weeks before the trial commenced, Justice Burns rejected the crown submission saying that the evidence sought to be admitted did “not have significant probative value”. Further, it would effectively mean five separate trials within a trial for the crown to prove the facts in each of those cases where violence was alleged. He also found the previous cases were not relevant to the shooting. As to the text messages, the trial judge originally accepted the argument that they should be before the jury because “the evidence reveals the expression of an attitude … that the rules do not apply to him in his activities as a police officer”. Later, the defence persuaded him that the texts were isolated chats among friends and could not necessarily reflect Rolfe’s state of mind in November 2019 at the time he shot Walker. The tests for admissibility of tendency evidence are not always easy to navigate. The Australian Law Reform Commission refers to situations where the “probative value is such that there is no rational view of the evidence that is consistent with the innocence of the accused”. The Judicial Commission of New South Wales points to situations where “the probative value of the evidence substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect the evidence may have on the accused”. Criminal trials are carefully constructed affairs where the information that is excluded from a jury can be just as important as the information they get to see and hear. Jurors are only to consider what is served up in the courtroom itself, except on occasions when they are taken on a “view” of the crime scene. To that extent, a jury exists in an artificial environment where selected facts are presented for determination. This was much easier to enforce in times where there might be one newspaper in a town with a court reporter who abided by the “rules”, or in cities where the mainstream media generally was compliant with instructions from the bench. In an age drenched in blogs and social media and where everyone can be a reporter, this is well-nigh out the window. People have their own ideas about what should be published and, in any event, information posted on news sites overseas can still be read by Australians in cases where evidence or verdicts are supposedly suppressed. So it was in the case of Cardinal George Pell, where the original guilty verdict in his child sexual abuse case was subject to a court-ordered suppression in Australia, but could be freely read on international news sites. The suppression in that case rested on a belief that a jury in a subsequent trial would be prejudiced if they knew that he had been found guilty of the sexual abuse and assault of choirboys in Melbourne.

Eighteen months after the Pell verdict, the NSW parliament amended the Evidence Act to allow more background details about an accused to be considered by juries. This was in response to recommendations from the child sexual abuse royal commission. In NSW, the figures from 2018 showed 91% of defendants in criminal proceedings were found guilty of an offence, yet for child sexual assault cases the conviction rate was 60%. The legislation opened up to juries in child sexual abuse cases more information that in other sorts of criminal trials might be regarded as prejudicial. The submissions and judgments about what goes in and what stays out of a trial are heard well out of earshot of jurors. It’s understandable if they feel disappointed to discover later they made a decision based on incomplete information.

3/26/2022,"A P&O ferry has been detained in Northern Ireland “due to failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training”, according to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA). The agency said the ship, the European Causeway, was impounded at the port of Larne. Transport secretary Grant Shapps said that the ferry was detained for being “unfit to sail”. Shapps wrote on Twitter: “Following my instruction to inspect all P&O vessels prior to entering back into service, the MCA has detained a ship for being unfit to sail. I will not compromise the safety of these vessels and P&O will not be able to rush inexperienced crew through training.” The MCA said: “The vessel will remain under detention until all these issues are resolved by P&O Ferries. Only then will it be reinspected.” Detention of ships is based on concerns over their safety and to prevent them going to sea. Karl Turner, Labour MP for Hull East, wrote on Twitter: “It gets worse for P&O Ferries, news just in that the European Causeway on the Cairnryan-Larne route has failed her Port State Inspection. “The vessel is arrested and detained by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency in Larne.” Earlier this week, an inspection was carried out by the MCA on a P&O ferry docked in Hull to ensure agency staff brought in to replace 800 sacked workers can operate it safely. Downing Street has called for the chief executive of P&O Ferries to resign over the sacking of the staff and pledged to push through legislation next week to force the company to reverse the move and pay its crew the minimum wage. Peter Hebblethwaite admitted to MPs on Thursday that his company broke the law by sacking the 800 workers without consultation. The transport union RMT said it welcomed the detention of the European Causeway and it demanded the government “seize the entire fleet” of P&O vessels.General secretary Mick Lynch said: “The seizing of the European Causeway by the MCA tonight shows that the gangster capitalist outfit P&O are not fit and proper to run a safe service after the jobs massacre.“This mob should be barred, their ships impounded and the sacked crews reinstated to get these crucial ferry routes back running safely.”",News/Business,"P&O ferry detained over crew training concerns, says coastguard agency",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/25/po-ferry-detained-over-crew-training-concerns-says-coastguard-agency
3/26/2022,"Grenada is playing host to an absorbing series decider between West Indies and England, if not always by way of quality out in the middle then certainly in terms of injecting some much needed Caribbean soul into proceedings. The steel drummers have been wonderfully relentless and the locals have already turned up in good numbers for what is the island’s first Test match in seven years; the arrival of the weekend promises a further rise here, so too a match situation which, after two topsy-turvy days, appears on a knife edge. Those who are drawn to the National Cricket Stadium in St George’s first thing will see West Indies resume on 232 for eight, with a lead of 28 over their visitors. It follows three hard-fought sessions of cricket that, like the previous day, saw a top-order collapse offset by a feisty rearguard down the order. Joshua Da Silva, the young Trinidadian wicketkeeper who says he is loving every second of his first taste of a proper crowd in Test cricket, will start out unbeaten on 54 from 152 balls. He had played beautifully in the final session, marshalling stands of 49 with Alzarri Joseph (28) and then an unbeaten one of 55 with Kemar Roach, 25 not out, like an old pro. Da Silva is a bit of an imposter at No 8, it must be said, having dropped down the West Indies batting card due to the inclusion of two all-rounders. But as an insurance policy, the 23-year-old has worked wonders here, arriving with his side on 95 for six – 109 runs behind – and changing the complexion of the day. Obduracy was his default setting but when the right-hander took on the second new ball before the close, whipping Craig Overton through mid-wicket for a stylish four that brought up his fourth Test half-century, England’s attack looked ready to plunge their feet in buckets of ice overnight. After the dull draws in Antigua and Barbados, the capricious nature of this surface has upped the entertainment levels significantly. And though England could not muster the same lavish sideways movement as their hosts found on the opening day, they discovered during the first two sessions that by smashing the ball hard into the pitch, its variable bounce brought rewards. This was a tactic Chris Woakes used to good effect during an afternoon that saw West Indies crumble from 71 for three to 134 for seven. Sheepish after an all-too friendly new ball spell that induced the double teapot from Joe Root, and knowing this tour had so far done little to assuage talk of a poor overseas record, Woakes delivered a fine three-wicket burst that gutted the middle order. First went Nkrumah Bonner, gloving behind after he failed to drop his hands while evading a bouncer, then Jason Holder for his third sorry dismissal in a row when he top-edged a pull shot third ball. Jermaine Blackwood might have felt a touch unlucky in a series of poor umpiring – some 16 decisions have been overturned – when he was lbw to one projected to merely scratch leg stump. Ben Stokes, who capped the second session with a gifted removal of Kyle Mayers for 28, had led the way here first thing. Battling an angry left knee and hobbling all day, Stokes claimed the first precious breakthrough in the 17th over when he charged in from the Darbeau End – named after the verdant neighbouring hills that are pockmarked with colourful cottages – and shot one low into the pads of Kraigg Brathwaite on 17. It was the simplest of lbw decisions for the umpire, Gregory Brathwaite, followed by an almost carbon copy grubber from Saqib Mahmood that sent Sharmarh Brooks packing for 13. Neither England bowler even felt compelled to appeal, proving Stuart Broad is here in spirit, at least, while he and Jimmy Anderson negotiate the fairways of St Andrews back home. At the other end Overton followed the approach amid a fiery battle with John Campbell. The opener cracked a couple of lusty fours during Overton’s innocuous opening spell but the England man won round two with a knockout, twice hitting Campbell on the helmet with nasty bouncers before a short ball to the hip area was gloved behind on 35. Overton was also the bowler when England picked up their solitary wicket of the evening session, Joseph having once again shown his fighting qualities during a restorative eighth wicket stand with Da Silva, only to attempt an ambitious slog down the ground on 28 and under-edge behind. But as had been the case 24 hours earlier, when Mahmood and Jack Leach had turned the tide with a 90-run 10th-wicket stand in England’s 204 all out, the softening of this Dukes ball and miles in the legs of the bowlers saw conditions ease significantly for lower-order batters prepared to fight their corner; Roach, who drove Stokes through cover to bring up the lead, is certainly one of those. England have the benefit of knowing West Indies must bat last on this surface but equally they must get a defendable target on the board first. Going by how the two top orders have fared so far, this won’t be entirely straightforward.",Sport/Sport,Joshua Da Silva stands firm to give West Indies narrow lead over England,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/25/resilient-joshua-da-silva-gives-west-indies-narrow-lead-over-england
3/26/2022,"Of course, it had to end with Pat Cummins. Two stumps dazed and blinking on the ground like the survivors of a big night out. Two arms outspread to the world. One high-wattage smile. There is no great achievement in firing a ball past Naseem Shah, a teenage No 11 who by batting ability should be classed as a No 15. The achievement was everything that came before the end of the third and deciding Test match in Lahore, everything this moment capped off. Even before the era when Australian teams did not visit Pakistan, Australian teams did not win in Pakistan. Sure, one series in 1959 against a fledgling side from a fledgling nation. Then the 1998 series against the grain, the last visit before the current tour. Those aside, Pakistan trips went a particular way: lose the first Test in Karachi on a spinning track, move to placid surfaces, be held to two draws. Lose the series 1-0. Rinse, repeat. Even Australia’s 1998 win followed the Pakistani model: a first-up win, this time in Rawalpindi, then two matches of stalemate. So on this long-awaited return in 2022 the Australian approach was a massive throwback. They managed to channel that old style, with 15 days of pure Test cricket grind. But this time around, the moment to take a lead did not come until the very end, deep on the fifth day of the final match. These Australians had to hold their nerve. Luckily, Cummins has had a charmed run since his abrupt elevation to captaincy on the eve of the recent Ashes. His contributions to this success have been substantial, both as captain and as leader of the attack. There will be times ahead when his decisions are as sound and his bowling as good and things still won’t go his way, but for now he can enjoy the spoils. Not that the series was perfect. He would have been deeply frustrated after Pakistan drew in the second Test in Karachi, and there was criticism of his choices around declarations and the follow-on. But it is absurd to look at a captain who leaves 172 overs to bowl out an opposing team and say they should have done more. Pakistan’s survival was an epochal effort, with captain Babar Azam’s 603 minutes at the crease the second-longest stand for any player in the fourth innings of a Test. Missed catches, not tactics, were Australia’s defining problem of that second Test. Steve Smith had the same issues in the third Test, a fine slip fielder starting to look fragile. He didn’t miss anything easy, but couldn’t position himself to get more than fingertips to the chances that kept flying past to his left. Until deep into the final day, another fast chance on that inside line from Nathan Lyon’s straight break, but Smith’s left hand snared the vital wicket of Babar. Rags to riches, a Cinderella story when Australian supporters had started to worry they had a glass slipper. Around that defining moment and Lyon’s eventual five wickets, Australia’s win was built on pace and its measured employment. In the first innings, Cummins timed to perfection an onslaught of reverse swing from himself and Mitchell Starc, rushing through seven wickets for 20 runs in the gathering gloom. Cummins allocating an extra over to Starc and being rewarded with Babar’s wicket was key to banking a sizeable lead. After Australia’s third-innings declaration, when Pakistan put together a serene opening partnership to finish day four with a big dent in the final target of 351, a sense of concern could well have prompted Cummins to start the fifth day with himself and Starc to try to blast a hole in the retaining wall. Instead he used all-rounder Cameron Green, whose natural length drew an edge behind from Abdullah Shafique. Cummins himself would intervene later in the day, knocking over Fawad Alam and the vital Mohammed Rizwan within minutes of one another to set Pakistan on a sure path to defeat. He is probably the best dead-track bowler in the world, able to bash the ball into the surface in such a way that he can create a threat where none should exist, while also having the skill to exercise swing and reverse swing subtly when on offer. As a leader, he kept his players calm through three matches of trying cricket, and playing the ultimate long game, was able to take the prize in the end. Forget a whole series: before Lahore, Australia had only even won three Test matches in Pakistan. The fact that a rare visit has now yielded an even rarer victory? It started with the captain, just as it ended with him.",Sport/Sport,Australia’s 15 days of pure Test cricket grind in Pakistan pay off with series win | Geoff Lemon,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/26/australias-15-days-of-pure-test-cricket-grind-in-pakistan-pays-off-with-series-win
