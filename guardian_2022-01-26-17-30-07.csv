1/26/2022,"Sir Elton John has postponed his concerts in Dallas, Texas, after testing positive for Covid-19 a week after restarting his farewell tour. The singer, 74, had just returned to the stage for the first time after a hiatus of almost two years, resuming his Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour in New Orleans last week.  The tour, John’s last after more than half a century on the road, started in 2018 but was postponed owing to the pandemic and then because the star musician needed hip surgery after a fall in September last year. After revealing on Instagram he had contracted the virus, John said his symptoms were mild and that he expected to perform in Arkansas at the weekend. “Hi everyone, wanted to send a message to let you know that I have contracted COVID and so have had to reschedule my shows in Dallas,” he wrote. “If you have tickets, you’ll be contacted with the new dates really soon. “It’s always a massive disappointment to move shows and I’m so sorry to anyone who’s been inconvenienced by this but I want to keep myself and my team safe. “Fortunately, I’m fully vaccinated and boosted and my symptoms are mild so I’m fully expecting to be able to make the Arkansas shows this weekend. “As always, thank you for all your love and support and I can’t wait to see you all soon!” John is the latest musical star to have a tour hit by Covid after Adele postponed the start of her Las Vegas residency because of Covid-related delays. The residency, titled Weekends with Adele, was due to begin on 21 January at the Colosseum in the Caesars Palace casino, celebrating her latest album 30, which topped music charts in the UK, Australia and the US. Adele said the show had been “absolutely destroyed by delivery delays and Covid”, adding half the crew were down with the virus. John is expected to play in states across the US until the end of April, after which he will begin the European leg of the tour. In November, he announced two special homecoming shows at Vicarage Road, the home of Watford football club, to end the tour in July. The singer recently claimed the No 1 position in the singles chart with a festive collaboration with Ed Sheeran and collaboration with Dua Lipa.",Arts/Music,Elton John postpones Dallas concerts after positive Covid test,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/26/elton-john-postpones-dallas-concerts-after-positive-covid-test
1/26/2022,"Simple changes to messages on restaurants’ menus can double the frequency of customers choosing plant-based options instead of meat, research on the impact of food on the climate crisis has found. The production, transportation and consumption of food has become an increasing focus for climate researchers, with a recent study finding the food industry accounts for more than a third of the world’s total annual planet-heating emissions.  Much of the pollution is centered on meat. Raising cattle, chickens and pigs for meat, a process that often involves clearing large tracts of forest, causes about double the emissions of plant-based foods. Meat consumption remains stubbornly high in the US – the average American gobbled down 264lb of meat in 2020 – and is rising quickly in countries such as China. Many people are receptive to the idea of switching to vegetarian options in order to help the environment, however, the research found, with messaging on restaurant menus a potentially significant way of shifting behaviour. A multi-stage experiment by the research non-profit organisation World Resources Institute (WRI) involved about 6,000 people in the US and their reaction to menu descriptions. Researchers tested responses to 10 different sustainability-themed messages when the participants were asked to choose between different options on a menu, such as a bean burrito or beef burrito. Several of the messages produced dramatic results. Diners who read “Each of us can make a positive difference for the planet. Swapping just one meat dish for a plant-based one saves greenhouse gas emissions that are equivalent to the energy used to charge your phone for two years. Your small change can make a big difference” on their menus chose a vegetarian dish 25% of the time, more than double the rate of diners who were shown no message at all. Another message – “90% of Americans are making the change to eat less meat. Join this growing movement and choose plant-based dishes that have less impact on the climate and are kinder to the planet” – prompted 22% of people to opt for a plant-based dish, again far higher than the standard group. Other messages, about the taste of the food and the need to protect the planet for future generations, also yielded positive results in choosing vegetarian meals, suggesting that consumers’ choices can be significantly shaped by how menus are presented. “We know behavioral science is critical, it really moves the needle,” said Edwina Hughes, head of the “cool food pledge”, an initiative by WRI and the United Nations. “Themes of making a small change for a big impact and also around joining a movement really boosted the plant-based options.” Hughes said Americans were ready for a “nudge” towards vegetarian options, likening such messages to hotels requesting their guests not demand their towels to be replaced every day, as a way to save water needed to wash them. “Using descriptive messages that show the benefits of plant-based food choices can empower people to change their behaviour and choose lower-carbon dishes,” Hughes said. “We can do this because people are primed and ready for this sort of messaging. They are receptive to seeing messages about the climate and are actively seeking out brands and logos that indicate climate-friendly products and services.” WRI researchers said previous attempts to promote vegetarian options had fallen short. Dishes have functionally been named “vegetarian lasagne” or “meat-free sausages”, as compared with more enticing meat nomenclature such as “grass-fed beef” or “butter-fried chicken”. When dishes are called vegan it “really turns off mainstream audiences. It comes across as preachy, righteous, aggressive,” said Jonathan Wise, a consumer researcher who added that more “inclusive” messages could get people to switch more easily to plant-based meals. “We launched a falafel burger in 2009, we said it is organic and it’s for vegetarians – it never sold well and we shut it down,” said Kaj Torok, chief sustainability officer at Max Burgers, a fast-food company that originated in Sweden. “The main thing we thought was: ‘Let’s not just go for this tiny group.’ It was important to go for the flexitarians [people who can skip eating meat] and those people who want to reduce their impact upon the climate.” Torok said Max Burgers’ focus was now taste, rather than whether what’s being served is meat or not, allowing it to drastically increase the number of plant-based burgers on menus. The company is part of WRI’s Cool Food Meals scheme, which has seen several food producers, including the Panera Bread chain, agree to disclose the carbon footprint of menu choices. Such labeling is far from universal, however, with most people unaware of the climate cost of the things they eat. “The time should be here where we have third-party verification of this,” Torok said.",News/Environment,Messages on menus can double number of diners choosing plant-based options,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/26/plant-based-food-restaurants-climate-menu-messages
1/26/2022,"“Fulham are top of the Championship with a goal difference of +48. I am acutely conscious of their capacity to screw things up, however, so what is the best goal difference a team has had and not been promoted?” asks Richard Hirst. It’s looking good for the Cottagers right now, a positive goal difference of +16 from their last four games sending them soaring at the top. But if you are looking for any historical pointers elsewhere to justify your wariness, then here you go.  Here’s Richard Askham. “Huddersfield Town, 1980-81, Steve Kindon et al,” he writes. “Goals for: 71; against: 40 … +31. They finished fourth behind promoted trio Rotherham, Charlton and Barnsley. It would have been +32 had the ball not gone in off the referee deep into injury-time at Hull. Promotion to the Premier League in 2016-17 with a goal difference of -2 more than made up for 1980-81, though.” Then again, teams have qualified for Europe before with negative goal differences … some have even won titles with them. “Brentford finished third in the 2019-20 Championship with a goal difference of +42,” recalls John Curry. “They were not promoted. But in the old Third Division North, where only the winner was promoted to the Second Division, Stockport County finished runners-up in 1929-30 with a goal difference of +62.” The National League also offers a few recent examples, including Wrexham (+52, 2011-12) and Luton (+44, 2009-10 and +48, 2010-11). Worst of all, Hereford United finished second in 2003-04 with 91 points and a +59 goal difference, finishing a point behind champions Chester and losing to Aldershot in the play-offs. Rough, but not as rough as in the Highland League. “Got two belters for you,” begins Mick McMenemie. “Formartine United finished second in 2016 with a goal difference of +102 (32 better than the winners Cove Rangers), but only the champions got entry into the play-offs for a league place. The year before, Brora won the league with a goal difference of +121, but lost to Montrose in the play-off final. No promotion but at least they got a trophy. Formartine got nothing.” “In making his debut for Aston Villa, Philippe Coutinho has now played for five European Cup or Champions League winners,” tweets Jez Orbell. “Can anyone better that?” Coutinho’s loan to Espanyol scuppers his perfect record, but in terms of teams the original Ronaldo can equal this, with his quintet of teams being PSV, Barcelona, Internazionale, Real Madrid and Milan (he also played at the South American champions Cruzeiro and Corinthians). The former Barnet star Edgar Davids can match this European mark too, having turned out for Ajax, Milan, Inter, Juventus and Barcelona. But several readers pointed to someone who has six. “Zlatan Ibrahimovic is an obvious candidate,” mails Paul Fenton, “having played for six European Cup winners (Ajax, Juventus, Inter, Barcelona, Milan and Manchester United) and two runners-up (Malmö and Paris Saint-Germain). All his European clubs have played in the final at some point, but he never has: his clubs have racked up almost 50 finals without him reaching one. Has any other player played for so many without actually playing in a final?” Last week we looked at matches with TV score abbreviations within one character of the two teams playing. But there are more incidents of note … Including this, from Michael Thomas: “When Dunfermline Athletic hosted Dundee a while back on TV, the BBC made us ‘DUN’ and Dundee, ‘DEE’. So it just said ‘DUN-DEE’.” And going back to the mention of Crystal Palace losing on penalties at home to Colchester in the 2019 League Cup, Robert notes that “they are also the UK military standard abbreviations for two different army ranks: Corporal and Colonel. In this context, it was no longer a giant-killing, as the far higher-ranking Colonel defeats the lowly corporal (10 ranks apart).” And then there is this. @TheKnowledge_GU As an aside to close abbreviations, how about abbreviations with music connections? This Prince related one has stuck with me since Dover player Crystal Palace in the third round of the Cup in 2015... pic.twitter.com/y0ytlC4gbN “I have taunted my fellow workers in our ad hoc quiz, asking who the first-ever sub in Premier League history was,” wrote Dag Fjeldstad in 2016. “I thought the correct answer should be Erik Thorstvedt coming on for Ian Walker. My hunch was hard to prove, but it is to some extent corroborated by the Spurs Firsts website. How nice it would be if you look into this and put the record straight if necessary.” We identified the first ever substitute in the English leagues back in 2001 here. When it comes to Premier League substitutions, sadly the taunting has to stop. The first season of the newly-rebranded Premier League was 1992-93, and Thorstvedt came on for Walker at half-time in Tottenham’s second game of that campaign, a 2-0 defeat at home to Coventry, thus missing out on the title of the new-look top-flight’s first sub by a considerable margin. That honour instead belongs to Mike Phelan, who replaced the crocked Paul Ince seven minutes into Manchester United’s 2-1 defeat at Sheffield United on the season’s opening day. The Guardian’s reporter at this game raged that the Mancunians’ disappointing performance demonstrated, er, “Alex Ferguson’s propensity for dubious judgments”, the need “for Ferguson to learn the difference between a striker and a goalscorer” and “Ferguson’s suspect ability to make the best use of what he has”, after which United went on to win the league not only that season but in six of the following eight as well, while Paul Ince – “rarely fit” – was runner up in the PFA Player of the Year voting and Ryan Giggs – “he seems to have stopped taking on players” – wrapped up the Young Player of the Year award, as well as finishing third in the voting for the Football Writers’ Association main gong. Anyway, this particular title was won by Phelan by a margin of 22 minutes, the next substitution coming at Crystal Palace, where Blackburn brought on Chris Price to replace Alan Wright in the 29th minute of a 2-2 draw. “As a Blackburn fan I put more stock in 19th century trophies than perhaps I should,” writes Simon Elliott. “However, are Rovers unique in winning major trophies in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries? Are there any equivalents from other countries? For the purposes of this, the 2002 League Cup is a major trophy.” “What are the oldest floodlight pylons that are still in use at a football ground in the UK?” wonders Gordon Smith. @TheKnowledge_GU After the Leicester v Spurs game just finished now, the latest two goals in a game for a team from come from behind to win? Apart from a game with a huge amount of injury time can’t be many later? “When Morocco played against Comoros, it occurred to me that this might be the highest ever number of o’s in a first-class fixture (six, three each),” suggests Daniel Marcus. “Can anyone come up with more?”“Has there even been, in a UK match, another pair of opposing captains whose surnames start with Z?” posed this commenter. “Katie Zelem (Manchester United) and Shelina Zadorsky (Tottenham) faced each other on Sunday.” After rumours of Lingard to Newcastle. Which player has played for the most 'Uniteds'?He'd be on 3 if it went through. “I was unpacking some deliveries at our shop which arrived in an old copy of the Sun sport pages from about 2010,” begins Warwick Bassett. “In the results, there was a team by the name of ‘The South Coast Team’.

1/26/2022,"As longstanding human rights campaigners, we are both well acquainted with the harsh realities of inequality and injustice in modern Britain. But the government’s nationality and borders bill – which will be in the committee stage at the House of Lords for the next two weeks – feels like a very personal insult. This is because it lays bare an uncomfortable and usually unspoken truth: that people like us, born in Britain but with foreign-born parents, are second-class citizens. We are talking about the bill’s provision to strengthen the government’s ability to deprive people of citizenship – a profound exercise of state power. Currently, the home secretary has the power to do this if they determine it is “conducive to the public good” and if they believe the person being deprived is eligible for the citizenship of another country. This last condition has been estimated to be applicable to several million people.  Hundreds of formerly British citizens, especially from ethnic minorities, have already been stripped of their citizenship in the past 15 years. But Boris Johnson’s government wants to go even further. Clause 9 of this generally poisonous bill would give ministers the ability to remove our British citizenship without even telling us. This would severely affect the right of appeal; contesting government decisions needs to be done in a timely and effective way, but how would this be possible if you don’t know that the decision has been made? It seems the government is saying, if we take your citizenship, you’ve lost it. Period. This is why we have come together, as members of the House of Lords, to oppose the government’s plans and will be supporting an amendment removing clause 9 in committee stage, along with other amendments to restrict already draconian citizenship removal powers. Why does clause 9 feel so personal? Because it seems to say that no matter that this is the only country we’ve ever lived in; no matter that our life’s work has been to make our nation fairer; no matter that we are both peers of the realm because of this work; no matter that our ancestors gave their lives in two world wars: our citizenship is precarious and conditional in a way that isn’t the case for many others. It can be stripped away by the government of the day. For those pushing through this bill, the history of Commonwealth migration of British citizens to the UK counts for nothing. Simon’s mother arrived in the late 1950s to give her best years to the recently formed NHS. Soon afterwards, the then health minister Enoch Powell (before he became an overt racist) flew to Barbados to call on British overseas citizens to come to the UK and support the NHS: thousands responded to that call. In that same era, Shami’s parents came from Kolkata to London. Years of race discrimination and even physical attacks never deterred them.In a House of Lords debate on the bill this month, peers spoke about the hundreds of thousands from Africa, the Caribbean and Asia who fought for Britain in two world wars, believing they were part of a wider family. They believed they had earned the right for their children and grandchildren to be treated as equals. It seems they were wrong. And this is not just an argument about morality: because when you have a second class, precarious version of citizenship it becomes open to political interpretation – as we have tragically seen in recent years. Everyone now accepts that the Windrush scandal – which saw legitimate British citizens denied healthcare and benefits, or hounded out of their country and left to die impoverished in places they had left as toddlers – is a stain on this country. So why are hundreds of British citizens still being stripped of their citizenship? Just recently a British-born man with Bangladeshi heritage had his citizenship removed and spent four years challenging the decision. He is now on his way back to the UK after winning his appeal. What the Windrush scandal and other cases show is that governments make a lot of mistakes. The idea that a “good British citizen” – particularly those from the most affected groups of Black and Asian people – can be safe and secure is frankly fanciful. Rather than continuing to erode fundamental rights, the government should be trying to strengthen security and belonging for everyone. That also goes for other parts of the bill, which trash even the 1951 refugee convention by treating the most desperate, who escape persecution by clandestine means, as second-class asylum seekers. This shouldn’t be a partisan issue. When the Conservative Lord Moylan spoke passionately about witnessing citizenship ceremonies as wonderful celebrations of belonging, he said: “My conception of British nationality is much more profound than a mere travel document. It is – or should be – a permanent and reciprocal bond of loyalty on the one hand and protection on the other … we should be building up and strengthening the bond between citizen and nation, whereas it seems to me that this provision goes only to dissolve it further.” He is right, of course. Millions of people in this country, whose passport photos show faces that are not white, are vulnerable to structural racism – including when turbo-charged by broad powers of citizenship deprivation. The thought of citizenship being stripped without notice will only create fear and alienation, and do nothing to bring the people of this nation closer together.

1/26/2022,"What’s the opposite of a cliffhanger? As the Premier League packs up for its winter break, as those depleted muscle fibres begin to regain their tensile strength, as English World Cup glory is all-but guaranteed (this was the plan wasn’t it?) by winter sun global marketing trips, it is hard to avoid the sense of dramatic entropy. The Premier League has always sold itself as blockbusting cinematic entertainment. As every screenwriter knows the key ingredient of any pulp drama is tension, obstacles, storylines that twang like an overtightened steel guitar string. Twenty-odd games in, the season has dished up something very different.  What we have here is a first act marked by the absence of tension: the greatest league in the history of leagues being great, reimagined as a piece of Japanese anti-cinema, all soporific repetition and meandering story arcs. Can we still fluff up some kind of title race out of this thing? Those hopes of a three-way pursuit to the line were all-but extinguished by Manchester City’s annihilating 12-match winning run from November into January. Saturday’s 1-1 draw at Southampton, during which City had 20 shots at goal and 74% possession, is pretty thin gruel when it comes to dredging up some new life. Cut forward to early May and perhaps this perfectly calibrated machine, this suffocating blue mist, a squad so perfectly grooved it has come closer than any other English team to making victory an inevitability, might be persuaded to collapse in a heap of nerves and shanked passes. We might yet see a damp-eyed Pep, headphones clamped, finger jabbing into the camera lens, saying: “I’ve kept quiet about this but when you say that about a man like Thomas Frank, well, you can tell Jürgen, if he’s watching this …” Or perhaps not. In reality the most obvious drama in the Premier League is located elsewhere. The only tension close to the top is the run-in to see which team gets the final place in the VIP lounge, also known as The Race For Fourth Place. There is even a sense of mild inevitability about this. In theory the final Champions League spot could go down to the wire, with Wolves still very much in contention from eighth place. There are interesting, evolving teams in that mix. Are Antonio Conte’s rage-ball contortions really a sustainable plan? Is this all going to be too much for that furred and fragile Tottenham heart? Are Arsenal good now? Is Mikel Arteta creating a new kind of energy, something homegrown and self-propelling, the first genuine post-Wenger iteration? Or is this just styling, soundbites, an expensive jacket, indestructible hair, spun out into a simulacrum of elite modern football? It is evidence of the strangeness of the league, and indeed the herd-think of social media, that it seems possible to believe both of these things almost simultaneously, depending on the last half-hour of football and whether Granit Xhaka has just been sent off or not. The most likely outcome is that the top four will remain as it is now. City, Liverpool and Chelsea are already out of sight. And for all their flaws Manchester United have four of the five best-paid players in the league, can afford to drop £90m footballers and have a revolving roster of attacking talent to hurl at the wall when their own incoherence starts to bite. Wealth and tortured momentum are still probably just about enough. The real heat is located much further down the table. It is probably apt in the current stratified landscape, with a sense of the world being divvied up into the saved and the damned, that the battle to remain in the Premier League is by some distance its most vital strand. There are hard commercial reasons for this sense of lifeboats being divvied up. The Premier League is in the process of refreshing its overseas broadcast deals. North and South America have been locked in over the last few weeks. But outside the top tier there is a genuine sense of flux. Derby County may be the most cinematic example of commercial hubris, but plenty of others have also taken on vast debt. This is not the moment to get stuck in the sunken place. Hence that sharpened sense of jeopardy. Forget titles and top fours. Repurpose the graphics. Add some minor chords to the triumphant music. Redirect the truck carrying Gary Neville and his lighted plinth. Who knows, we may be in for one of the great relegation races. The margins already look tight, with seven points separating bottom-placed Burnley from Everton in 16th. There is plenty of life down there too. Anyone present at Selhurst Park just after Christmas to see Norwich’s 3-0 defeat by Crystal Palace will have assumed we had our first confirmed casualty. That was the day the sarcastic goal-applause went mainstream, when Norwich’s players just looked too timid and broken for his battle. Fast forward three weeks and Dean Smith’s team are 17th and on a roll. The return of key players has helped, with six changes to their Palace starting XI in the team that beat Watford on Friday. Norwich have a tendency to assert their own game against weaker opponents then fall away against teams that can also pass and keep the ball. But it might just be enough, because, frankly, it’s chaos down there. Leeds are surely the most secure of the back markers – dragged into this by circumstance, but still there, just above the lip of the pit. Otherwise that race to the bottom really is wide open. Watford look the most doomed, a club where this kind of jeopardy is factored into the business model, although Roy Hodgson turning up adds an intriguing note of pragmatism. Hodgson is 74 years old now, but he does know how to organise a team. Burnley have the unity of purpose to defy the limitations of an ageing squad. They have also played a massive four games fewer than Norwich and five fewer than Brentford, who have lost six of their past seven and really do need a deep breath and a time-out over the winter break. Much as it might rile a pre-riled fanbase, Newcastle being relegated would be one of the stories of the season in European football. But it seems unlikely from here. The pure, ruthless genius of paying £25m for Chris Wood might yet prove to be the key stroke, a chess move that hurts Burnley more than it aids Newcastle. This is where instant liquidity, and the freedom to chuck that money around without consequence, really does make a difference. Eddie Howe has a sleek, hungry look about him. Kieran Trippier is a very smart signing, and also tactically on-trend: gamechanging emergency right-backs are the new gamechanging emergency centre-forwards. On the other hand Newcastle’s final five games include Liverpool, City and Arsenal, who always beat them, plus Norwich away and the mouthwatering prospect of Burnley on the final day. Things may well settle before then. But there is a grand final act in the making here, a breath of competitive life in a moribund year, and a fitting sense that the real game, right now, is simply surviving.",Sport/Football,In this season’s Premier League look down for the real drama | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/26/in-this-seasons-premier-league-look-down-for-the-real-drama
1/26/2022,"Kitty Wallace remembers very clearly the first time she felt there was something horribly wrong with her face. She was eight years old, in her downstairs bathroom with a friend as they washed their hands before dinner. “I just remember looking at our reflection and thinking how different I looked to her,” she says. “At that moment, I had this very strong feeling that my face was offensive or disfigured compared with hers, and then a sudden realisation that this must be as obvious to everyone else as it was to me.”  This belief in the “wrongness” of her own face grew stronger and stronger. By the time Wallace reached her teens, it was all she thought about, along with an acute paranoia about public humiliation. “The fear of people noticing how deformed I was, of being made fun of, was overwhelming,” she says. “It was like everyone was looking at me and judging me.” What Wallace didn’t know at the time was that she was suffering from body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), a condition that causes a debilitating preoccupation with perceived defects in your appearance, often causing crippling self-consciousness and fear of social rejection. Wallace is now one of the UK’s leading campaigners for BDD, using her own battle to raise awareness of this often misunderstood and still largely hidden illness. The Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation (BDDF), for which Wallace now works, says there could be hundreds of thousands of undiagnosed cases across the UK. “One study estimates that BDD affects about 2.2% of the population, which is about 1 in 50 people,” says Wallace. She says that, despite celebrities including Billie Eilish, Robert Pattinson and Shirley Manson talking openly about their struggles with BDD, “there’s still barely any recognition or real understanding of what this condition is among health professionals. People just aren’t getting the help or treatment that they need. Most people suffer for 10-15 years before they get a diagnosis.” In her job now, as the BDDF’s head of operations, Wallace is constantly in contact with people who have BDD and sees her story reflected in their struggles. “For me, it was an overwhelming belief that there was something wrong with the very core of who I was, inside and out, and that is really isolating,” she says. “At the BDDF, a lot of our work is trying to show people that they’re not alone and it’s not their fault.” As the charity’s main staff member, Wallace not only fundraises, organises events and manages the website, she also facilitates support groups and organises a biannual national BDD conference. “I was still really struggling in 2016, which was when I went to the first BDD conference as an attender,” she says. “And then the next time they ran the conference in 2019, I was organising it!” Wallace remembers feeling a huge sense of compassion and empathy for everyone who was brave enough to attend. She was 19 when she was diagnosed. “I just think of how different my life could have been if I’d known earlier. All those years I lost to BDD and how it’s still affecting my life now. Nobody should have to go through that.” One of the biggest problems, she says, is that BDD typically manifests in late childhood or early adolescence, around the time of puberty when many people are going through emotional and physical upheavals. “So it’s often just dismissed as a phase or misdiagnosed as anxiety or depression,” she says. “Even though I have really supportive family and friends, people just expected me to grow out of it, which left my BDD to run wild and completely control my life.” Looking back, she now sees the signs were always there. Even as a very small child she always struggled with acute anxiety. “I never remember feeling naturally comfortable or secure in myself, or safe in the world,” she says. She also exhibited many tendencies associated with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) that she now recognises as signposts to her BDD. “I remember being very young and being obsessed with my clothes being clean – even the slightest mark would mean I’d have to change. I had this really strong feeling that if I spilled something down myself, people would think I was dirty and disgusting.” By the time she was sent to an all-girls boarding school at the age of 12, her BDD had already taken control. “I was already fixated on my face, and I had acne, short hair and glasses. In what was a really image-obsessed environment, it made me the focus of a lot of attention,” she says. “There were constant comments on my appearance and how I needed to change or improve. It was confirmation that I had to find ways to make myself, and my face specifically, acceptable.” Soon, Wallace engaged in multiple lengthy makeup sessions every day. She would get up at 5am every morning and spend two hours on her makeup before she was able to leave her room and go down to breakfast. “I’d eat breakfast really quickly, run back up to my room to check my makeup, go to class, go back to my room to check my makeup, always checking, checking, checking that I’d managed to hide how disgusting my face was. I couldn’t let it slip for a minute. It was exhausting and I was desperately lonely.” Over the years, her BDD shifted focus from her hair to her skin, to individual features on her face. “As well as spending hours on makeup routines, I became obsessed with hair washing, then checking my skin to make sure there were no blemishes,” she says. “I was constantly picking at my skin, which a lot of people with BDD do; everything had to be smooth and perfect. The idea of a whitehead on my face was torture.” Wallace’s nose became an acute source of fear and shame. “I would think all day about when I could have a nose job, how that was the only thing that would make me normal. I grew a long fringe that was my security blanket and I hid behind it for years, trying to cover as much of my face from public view as possible.” Wallace finished school, but says that many students with BDD drop out of education altogether. One study found that almost 60% of young people between 12 and 18 years old with a diagnosis of BDD were either not attending school at all or attending only sporadically. Wallace also points to a study that estimates the risk of suicide among those with the condition is 45 times higher than the national average. She says that she has felt suicidal at points and that if it hadn’t been for the support of her family she doubts she would have survived. “We’ve lost so many people because GPs, health practitioners and teachers simply don’t know what BDD is,” she says. “There are virtually no treatment programmes available, yet BDD leads to suicide, depression and self-harm. Many people alter their faces through multiple cosmetic surgeries and get acute anxiety, which means they lead very limited and painful lives.” When Wallace first heard about BDD, she had finished school and was living “in self-imposed seclusion” at her family home while her friends took gap years and attended universities across the country. Then, her twin brother got a call. A friend had seen a documentary about BDD. “He said: ‘I think this is what’s wrong with your sister,’ so my whole family watched it and there was a collective ‘Oh my God, this is Kitty’ moment,” she says. Her mother found the BDDF online. When Wallace visited the website she says it wasn’t much more than a landing page, but it did have a BDD symptom checklist and when she read it she felt “like someone had crawled inside my brain and written down everything they could find. The idea that what I had was a condition, that it wasn’t my fault, was like a huge weight disappearing from my shoulders. For years, I’d blamed myself for everything.” Wallace checked in to the Priory which, at that time, ran one of the only specialist BDD clinics in the country. She was subsequently referred to Dr Rob Wilson, a specialist cognitive behavioural therapist working on BDD and the co-founder of the BDDF, for counselling. “At the beginning, going into treatment was really tough but soon I was having these huge moments. I clipped my fringe back off my face for the first time and was able to walk down the street without believing that everyone was staring at me,” she says. “It was a slow release from the grip that BDD had held over me since childhood.” It hasn’t been a straight line towards recovery. At 28, Wallace relapsed after she developed dermatitis, which caused her face to break out in an angry red rash. “I didn’t leave the house for six months,” she says. “I totally gave up. I wouldn’t even sit in the back garden in case the neighbours saw me.” She returned to counselling and, during one of her sessions, Wilson told her that most of the BDDF’s funding came from In Memoriam donations from families who had lost children to the condition. “It just made me so angry to realise that my life could be worth more when I was dead than when I was alive,” she says. “I suddenly felt that I owed it to the people who hadn’t made it to get involved and try to change things, so that others didn’t die needlessly.” Wallace started volunteering at the BDDF and, three years on, became its first paid staff member. Since she started working at the foundation she has managed to secure lottery funding to launch a dedicated email helpline, which has helped hundreds of people with BDD get help and treatment. She has also revamped the website and has seen the number of annual visitors more than double, with 500,000 this year alone. “Seeing the numbers go up is hugely gratifying because you know that people will now be able to understand what’s happening to them. But it’s also frustrating because we’re a small charity and we’re struggling to cope with the numbers asking for help,” she says. Prior to lockdown, she co-facilitated monthly face-to-face support sessions, which brought people with BDD together for group counselling. When the pandemic hit, they stopped meeting in person but quickly realised that their community was struggling and launched weekly online sessions. “When we went online, the numbers just boomed,” she said. “We had people from Norway, the US, India, Italy; people in their teens all the way up to their 70s.” She says that facilitating these groups is one of the most rewarding parts of her job. “Sometimes, the people in our groups have never met anyone else with the same condition. You get to see that person change when they realise that they’re in a safe place and that they don’t need to apologise or explain their behaviour, they can just talk and be themselves. There is no judgment.” She says that things are worse for young people with BDD now, compared with when she was growing up: “Now, there is a relentless barrage of images of people looking flawless on social media, with no transparency about how much these [pictures] have been airbrushed or filtered.” Earlier this year, Wallace helped launch a partnership between the BDDF and the fashion brand Monki , lobbying for EU legislation that would see brands and social media users legally required to put a notice on advertising or social media posts that had been altered or filtered. Since it was launched three weeks ago, their petition has been signed by more than 30,000 people. “The campaign with Monki is so important because it gets awareness of BDD out to a huge number of people and this could save lives,” she says. “We’re still a small charity and we’re dealing with such a huge problem, but there is also so much hope for people with BDD if they get the right help.” It is this hope that keeps Wallace fighting. “Even though my BDD is still with me, I’ve got a great job and I’m getting married next year – these things seemed impossible even a few years ago. I just want people with BDD to know that they can get better and that they’re not alone.” The BDDF website is bddfoundation.org and more information about their petition calling for social media image transparency can be found here.

1/26/2022,"A strange thing happens when rage builds; the tears follow. And with that, the lump in the throat, the burning in the eyes, comes the fear.  “Am I making a fool of myself?” “Have I caused more problems?” “Am I even making sense?” Giving voice to that rage comes with constant calculations. And if you’re a woman, it’s usually followed by an apology. So what happens when we’re no longer willing to make nice? What happens when decades of conditioning to smile through the discomfort, for the sole purpose of making others feel comfortable, shatters? What happens when women start declining to make Very Important Men feel better about themselves and their offensive opinions? I found myself thrust into that moment, when appearing on The Project to discuss an essay I had written on covering the sexual assault allegations that dominated the last parliamentary year, as a sexual assault survivor myself. Day after day I had relived parts of my rape while listening to leaders discuss whether we were even able to have a discussion on sexual violence. People, mostly women, told me their stories – countless stories of lives thrown off course, of potential never realised, of fear and shame and anger – while men lamented how tired they were of covering the “issue”. Politicians were quick to deflect, like rape and sexual violence was just another political game, one they could play to their advantage, or dead bat away. I wrote about the rage I saw building, and spilling, the rage that has not dissipated, that is not forgotten. The rage that still simmers below the surface. Today, Grace Tame met with the Prime Minister at the Lodge, with now-viral photos appearing online. We discuss the day and the differing opinions with @AmyRemeikis. #TheProjectTV pic.twitter.com/9TsYJbFKfY Since then we have been assured, by Very Important Men, things have been happening. Action was being taken. Women were being listened to. And then Grace Tame didn’t smile at a staged political photo opportunity. Never mind that she had shaken the prime minister’s hand. Never mind that she appeared to be walking past quietly when the prime minister called out to stop her. Never mind that she survived being groomed and told what to do by a predator who attempted to steal her sense of self away from her as he raped her. Grace Tame didn’t smile or appear at ease while having her photo taken in a situation which clearly made her uncomfortable, and in the politics of civility she had committed the worst of crimes. And then one of those men whose actions and words and decisions had contributed to why I wrote of the rage women felt in those months, and still feel now, felt the need to write a piece criticising Tame. Faced with the audacity on national television, my rage bubbled to the surface. I shook. I heard my voice struggle past the emotion in my throat. My eyes burned, my breath caught, and I found I could no longer play nice. And as I shook afterwards, I could only think “Did I embarrass myself?” “Did I even make sense?” We expect women and those with less institutional power to keep the peace. We expect them to smile. We coach children to smile in situations where they are clearly uncomfortable, and then some are expected to keep smiling for the rest of their lives. Because sexual assault is obviously very serious – but could you just be polite while you speak on it? Surely you could just smile for the camera? And if you can’t do that, then just don’t show up. You can have your place in the room – but only if you behave yourself. How can Very Important Men take you seriously when you’re ranting and raving like that? The response to not playing nice has been a little overwhelming, but it has also revealed just how little we see it. Very Important Men and crumb maidens have made a career out of speaking over smaller voices, of challenging others, of playing “devil’s advocate”, of using false equivalence to trip someone up, and discredit what they are saying. But if someone outside of the accepted mould challenges the politics of civility, then civility is weaponised against them. In that arena, it doesn’t matter what you have to say. You didn’t say thank you, so you no longer deserve a seat at the table. Until you learn some manners, you can stay in your place. That place, of course, being far away from any position of power or authority which could challenge the status quo. And in the end, that’s what it is all about. Orders to smile, to be polite, to play nice are just orders to stay quiet. It’s just dressed up in a more polite way.
