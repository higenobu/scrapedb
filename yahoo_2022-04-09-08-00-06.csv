4/9/2022,"Babraham Institute in Cambridge announced on Thursday researchers had successfully rejuvenated skin cells. Scientists reprogrammed adult skin cells to look and behave 30 years younger than the original. The technique cannot be taken to a clinic yet because previous studies have found it may increase the risk for cancer. A team in the Babraham Institute in Cambridge has successfully rejuvenated a 53-year-old woman's skin cells to look and behave like a 23-year-old's, the research center announced on Thursday. The team had initially set out to create embryonic stem cells, which can divide into any type of cell in the body, using adult cells. Nobel Award winner Shinya Yamanaka, a researcher at Kyoto University in Japan, first turned ""normal"" cells that have a specific function into stem cells back in 2006. The BBC reported German molecular biologist Wolf Reik, postdoctoral student Diljeet Gill, and a team at Babraham Institute built upon Yamanaka's work. Yamanaka grew stem cells by exposing adult cells to four molecules for about 50 days — a unique method he named iPS. Reik and Gill's team exposed skin cells to the same molecules for only 13 days, then let them grow under natural conditions. By studying collagen production in the cells, the researchers found age-related changes on skin cells were removed and they temporarily lost their identity. After growing under normal conditions for a period of time, researchers found the cells began behaving like skin cells again. The team then measured age-related biological changes in the reprogrammed cells, and found the cells matched the profile of those 30 years younger to reference data sets, Gill said in a release. ""I remember the day I got the results back and I didn't quite believe that some of the cells were 30 years younger than they were supposed to be,"" Gill told BBC. ""It was a very exciting day."" The research was done in a lab, and Reik told the BBC the team cannot take the technique to a clinic because the technique used to rejuvenate the cells has the potential to increase the risk of cancer, likely due to creating lasting genetic changes within cells. But the biologist said the method of rejuvenating cells could help speed up healing time in burn victims, and may eventually extend human life. ""Eventually, we may be able to identify genes that rejuvenate without reprogramming, and specifically target those to reduce the effects of aging,"" Reik said in a press release. The researchers published their findings in the journal eLife on April 8.

4/9/2022,"The U.S. Navy quietly declared the controversial aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford ready for combat in late 2021. Ford, whose keel was laid in 2009, suffered from cost overruns and technical headaches that put it years behind schedule. It’s a mystery why the Navy did not announce the news about the aircraft carrier until now. The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, the most expensive warship ever built, is finally ready for combat duty. The U.S. Navy quietly approved the ship for initial operations capability during the tail end of 2021, with little to no fanfare—an unusual ending to a ship development process that saw more than a half-decade of terrible publicity. Ford will head out for its first deployment later this year, four years later than originally planned. Gerald R. Ford is the first of the Ford-class aircraft carriers; the class will eventually replace existing Nimitz-class carriers. As the first class in decades, Ford-class ships will integrate a whole slew of new technologies. Ford was designed with a new radar system, the Dual-Band Radar; new electromagnetically-powered aircraft launch catapults and weapons elevators; new aircraft arresting gear; and more. The result was supposed to be a highly efficient warship capable of more aircraft sorties. Unfortunately, much of the new equipment ran into serious technical problems. While these issues were gradually knocked out, the most pervasive problem—the advanced weapons elevators (AWEs) that lifted aircraft bombs and missiles from the bowels of the ship to the flight deck—was only completely solved last year. The program manager for Ford, quoted in DefenseOne, tied the eventual AWE solution to the ship’s initial-operations-capable declaration. Initial operations capable (IOC) is a term used to describe new weapons systems that have been certified as cleared for certain combat duties. It does not mean that the weapon system is rated to conduct all of its combat duties, but it can conduct enough of them to be considered deployable for combat. It is not clear what, if anything, is holding Ford back from being considered fully operations-capable. The U.S. Navy’s 100,000-ton, 1,092-foot-long super-carriers typically take five years to build. Construction on Ford began in 2009, but production difficulties meant she would only be commissioned in 2017, eight years later. Despite commissioning, she would be unable to actually serve as a fleet-ready aircraft carrier until December 2021. Here’s a video of one of the advanced weapon elevators in operation, courtesy U.S. Naval Institute News: According to the Congressional Research Service, USS Ford ultimately cost $13.3 billion, making her one of the most expensive (if not the most expensive) ships ever built. The cost does not include the unit cost of Ford’s 70+ aircraft, which will include 40 to 50 F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and F-35 Joint Strike Fighters; five EA-18G Growler electronic attack aircraft; 19 MH-60 Seahawk helicopters; four E-2D Hawkeye airborne early-warning aircraft; and two MV-22B Osprey cargo transports. It also does not factor in the cost of protecting the ship, which falls to a mixture of guided-missile cruisers, destroyers, and nuclear-powered attack submarines, and the logistics ships that keep Ford and her escorts supplied at sea. It’s a bit of a mystery, as DefenseOne points out, why the U.S. Navy was so quiet about Ford’s IOC status. Ford’s news coverage has been deservedly negative over the years, as costs grew and equipment failed to work as advertised. Now that the long, tortured road is over, it should be time for the Navy to celebrate and communicate to the world that the ship is finally ready for duty. In related news, shipyard Huntington Ingalls Industries laid the keel for the third Ford-class carrier, USS Enterprise. Enterprise will be the ninth U.S. Navy warship bearing the name; previous ships have included an aircraft carrier that served in World War II and the world’s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. At this rate, Enterprise should be commissioned in the 2027 to 2028 timeframe. The fourth carrier, USS Doris Miller, will follow her in the shipyard.

4/9/2022,"Talk of a looming recession is rampant around the globe, and now a major U.S. bank has issued its own dire forecast for the global economy. It’s been over a month since Russia invaded Ukraine, leading to an unforeseen and prolonged fallout for the global economy. Combined with an inflation problem that was already spiking the prices of virtually every commodity, global institutions have begun ringing the alarm bells that we are on the brink of a long-anticipated recession. In an investment strategy report sent to clients on Thursday, Bank of America analysts warned that “inflation always precedes recessions” and that tighter monetary policies being put in place to control surging prices make a “recession shock” very likely. Inflation has been the bane of the U.S. economy for months, and rates have hit new highs since the war began. The annual inflation rate jumped to 7.9% in February, the highest it’s been in four decades, and the latest forecasts suggest March’s rate could reach 8.5%, according to investment bank UBS. Such a rate would be the highest since 1981. The Federal Reserve has been laser-focused on the problem for months, and the central bank began hiking interest rates weeks ago in an effort to temper demand and counter runaway inflation. Higher interest rates have led to an inversion of the so-called yield curve, which means that short-term yields have suddenly become much more attractive than the traditionally higher long-term ones. A surge in short-term yields is an indicator that investors believe the immediate future of the market is better than the long-term view. BofA analysts say this inversion is a sign that a recession is nigh. “Yield curves always steepen as recessions begin,” the report read. BofA has joined a chorus of financial institutions warning about the likelihood of an immediate recession. Market-watchers have cautioned that an economic slowdown is the reasonable outcome to assume, given current low unemployment numbers in the U.S. and rising inflation rates. And a growing list of billionaires, global investors, and Wall Street personalities have expressed more and more certainty that the trends we are seeing point to one clear conclusion: A recession is close.

4/9/2022,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Mike Gibbons, a leading Republican Senate candidate from Ohio, said at a media event last fall that middle-class Americans don't pay “any kind of a fair share” of income taxes. “The top 20% of earners in the United States pay 82% of federal income tax — and, if you do the math, and 45% to 50% don’t pay any income tax, you can see the middle class is not really paying any kind of a fair share, depending on how you want to define it,” Gibbons said. The comments by Gibbons, a millionaire investment banker from Cleveland, were made in a September episode of “The Landscape” podcast by Crain's Cleveland Business. But they could take on new resonance after Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, a potential 2024 presidential candidate, introduced a governing plan in February that has divided the party over its call to raise taxes on millions of Americans who don’t earn enough to pay federal income taxes. Scott, who leads the Senate Republicans’ campaign arm, has said that paying even a small tax would give poor people “skin in the game” to boost their interest and involvement in how tax dollars are spent. Other leading Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have distanced themselves from Scott's proposal, worried that the prospect of raising taxes on lower-income Americans could prompt election-year attacks from Democrats. Campaign spokesperson Samantha Cotten said Friday that Gibbons has pledged not to raise taxes on individuals or businesses. “Mike Gibbons does not support tax increases on any American — and never has,” she said in a statement. “Mike is a businessman, not a career politician and he understands economics and how to implement smart ideas and strategies that will benefit all Americans.” Yet, ahead of the May 3 primary, Republican rivals are looking to use the comments against Gibbons. One opponent, Republican Mark Pukita, has had it posted on his YouTube page for the last three weeks with the caption ""Tax Hike Mike Gibbons.” Asked about the Scott plan during a Republican Senate debate last week, former Ohio Republican chair Jane Timken said she opposes his proposal to raise taxes on the middle class, while “Hillbilly Elegy” author J.D. Vance said the GOP needs to stand for “middle-class people being able to raise a family and do it on a single income.” In the video, Gibbons is pictured before a campaign backdrop and criticizes Democrats for advancing an “absolutely false” narrative that “the middle class is getting screwed and the wealthy, the elite, are cheating everybody” because they ""need the middle class to win an election.” He says he doesn't have a problem with a ""progressive tax system structure"" but notes that the wealthy already pay a lot in taxes. Gibbons asks: “How much of the total tax bill can a very small percentage of the nation pay and still be a democracy?"" Democrats have spent the better part of a decade pushing for higher taxes on top earners and will likely do so again this year. President Joe Biden included a “Billionaire Minimum Income Tax” in his 2023 budget proposal. In announcing the tax proposal, the Democrat asserted that “a firefighter and a teacher pay more than double” the tax rate that a billionaire pays. According an analysis of 2019 Internal Revenue Service data, the most recent available, by the fiscally conservative Tax Foundation, the top 10% of Americans earn 47.3% of reported income and pay 70.9% of the income taxes. The bottom 50% of American wage earners report 11.5% of the income and pay 3.1% of the taxes. That leaves the middle 40% of Americans earning 41.2% of the income and paying 26.1% of the income taxes. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, argues that such figures do not reflect considerable amounts of wealth among high-income Americans that are shielded from taxation or are taxed at lower rates than wage earners.",Politics/Associated Press,Ohio GOP Senate hopeful: Middle class doesn't pay fair share,https://news.yahoo.com/ohio-gop-senate-hopeful-middle-220541018.html
