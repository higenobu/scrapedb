1/25/2022,"A Chinese teenager who was sold by his parents as a baby, and reportedly rejected by them after a recent reunion, has died. Liu Xuezhou apparently took his own life in Hainan province on Monday morning, according to reports. His story has gripped China and prompted an outpouring of sympathy. The 17-year-old's story first came to national attention after he posted a video asking for help finding his biological family. According to media reports, Liu was sold by his biological parents in 2005 and was taken in by another family. However, his adoptive parents later died in an accident, and he spent most of his life with his grandparents and other relatives. In December last year the 17-year-old managed to track down his birth parents, who had since divorced and remarried, after he started an online search. Mr Liu said on social media that it had been a happy reunion at first - but things took a turn after he reportedly claimed he needed financial help. He said he had asked his parents if he could live with them, or to buy or rent a home for him as he did not have one of his own. However, he alleged that his parents cut him off instead, with his mother even blocking him on messaging platform WeChat. His parents have disputed this, with his mother saying Mr Liu tried to force her into buying him a home, which she could not afford. Mr Liu later said he would sue his birth parents for abandonment, saying in a Weibo post that he would ""see them in court"". The teenager was then reportedly cyberbullied, with many saying that he had only wanted a house from his parents and that he was trying to gain sympathy. Bullied for being 'effeminate' in China New China child policy sparks tales of 'trauma' The secret note that led to my birth parents Just after midnight on Monday, Mr Liu posted a long essay on Weibo, in which he detailed the events of his life and how he was attacked online. ""I have endured being called many names,"" he said, saying he had been effectively ""abandoned twice"" by his biological parents. In the final lines of his note he said he was ""ending this life of mine"". The post triggered frantic comments urging him not to take his own life, and calls for those in the nearby vicinity to find him. His aunt later confirmed his death with local media, saying he was later found hours after the note was published and rushed to a hospital where he died in the early hours of Monday. Mr Liu's Weibo page has since been flooded with sympathetic comments, with many expressing anger towards the cyberbullies. ""The cyberbullying he endured was too much to bear for an adult, let alone a child,"" one said. Others said they hoped he would find a good family ""in his next life"". ""I hope in your next life you find parents who protect you, brothers and sisters who love you and live a life without worries"".

1/25/2022,"DURACH, Germany (AP) — Andrzej Sitkowski was 15 years old when his mother told him that she had been asked by a neighbor to hide a little Jewish girl from the Nazis at their home. “It was a short conversation, and then, yes, we decided to take in Hadassah and she was brought over to our house in 1943,” Sitkowski says, looking back at those difficult years during World War II when he lived with his widowed mother Helena and younger sister Magda on the outskirts of the Polish capital of Warsaw under German occupation. “Of course, we were afraid, but fear was our daily dish during those years anyway,” Sitkowski told The Associated Press at his home in the Bavarian village of Durach where he settled 10 years ago with his German wife. Almost eight decades after Hadassah Kosak's rescue, the 93-year-old Polish man is still regularly in touch with Kosak, now 84, who after the war immigrated via Israel to the United States where she became a professor of history in New York. For their efforts to help save the lives of Kosak, her sister Marion and their mother Bronislawa, who later also came to stay with the Sitkowskis, Andrzej and his mother were given Israel's highest honor in 1995. They were named “Righteous Among the Nations” — a title bestowed on non-Jews who took great risks to save Jews during the Holocaust by Yad Vashem, the country’s official Holocaust remembrance organization. This year, as the world commemorates the 77th anniversary of the liberation of the German Nazi Auschwitz concentration and extermination camp on January 27, 1945, Yad Vashem and the Conference on Jewish Material Claims against Germany have teamed up to highlight the stories of ""Righteous Rescuers"" like the Sitkowskis who risked everything, even their own lives, to save Jews from getting slain by the Nazis and their henchmen. As part of a social media campaign called #Don'tBeABystander, the Claims Conference and Yad Vashem are releasing several videos and launching a website about people who saved Jews during the Holocaust in which 6 million Jews were murdered across Europe. “One of the amazing thing about the rescuers is that not only did they rescue the specific person who was hidden, but all of their children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren — an entire family tree,” said Greg Schneider, the executive vice president of the Claims Conference. “It says in the Jewish tradition that if you save one person it is as if you save the whole world,"" Schneider told the AP. Over the past 60 years Yad Vashem has recognized about 28,000 individuals from some 50 countries as “Righteous Rescuers.” The organization still receives hundreds of applications each year to honor others, mostly posthumously. Of all the rescuers still alive today, most helped their parents as children or teenagers. “We believe about 200 of them are still alive and most of them are living in Europe,” said Dani Dayan, the chairman of Yad Vashem. “As antisemitism is growing again on all five continents, we need to stress again the moral stature of these persons and their actions.” In Poland, home to Europe’s largest Jewish community before the Holocaust, the Nazi occupiers punished those who helped Jews by executing not only the helpers, but their entire families. Still, when you ask Sitkowski about why he and his mother decided to help Jews despite the huge personal risks, he shrugs and says it simply was their duty as human beings. “When my mother told me about the request from the neighbor there were no long deliberations. The approval was somehow obvious,” Sitkowski remembers, tucking in his red scarf. “It was just an impulsive decision of a Mensch,"" he adds, using the German word for human being that in Yiddish also refers to a particularly good person. Sitting in his living room overlooking the snowy foothills of the Alps, he smiles when he thinks of Hadassah. “She was a beautiful little girl, very smart, with sort of darkish hair and black eyes — I grew very fond of her.” Even today, there's still a strong bond between them. In the past, they would visit each other and nowadays they talk on the phone and exchange letters. In their conversations, their memories often wander back to those months of hiding when the Sitkowskis shared their meager food rations with Hadassah, when Andrzej taught five-year-old Hadassah how to read and write, and when they made their neighbors and acquaintances believe a fabricated story in which Hadassah was not a Jew, but a Christian-Polish girl whose mother had been taken to Germany as a forced laborer. In reality, Hadassah's mother was hiding as a maid with another family and her sister Marion was hiding at a Catholic convent. But when those hiding places were no longer safe, the two joined Hadassah at the Sitkowskis. In September 1944, however, the Nazis first burned down the Sitkowski home and many other houses on their street and then later expelled all people who had lived there. So they needed to escape again and eventually the Sitkowskis and Kosaks had to split up and survived the last months of the war in different places across Poland until the Soviet Army liberated Poland in January 1945. While Hadassah Kosak first moved to Israel and later to the United States, her mother and sister ended up in Britain, where Marion married Ralph Milibrand and where their two sons Ed and David, two well-known politicians with the British Labour Party, were born. The decision of Andrzej and his mother to offer a shelter “was a true act of humanity,” Hadassah Kosak told the AP. “Thanks to their bravery, and at a great risk to themselves, we survived the Nazi horrors.”",World/Associated Press,"77 years after Auschwitz, Jews honor those who rescued them",https://news.yahoo.com/77-years-auschwitz-jews-honor-074006991.html
1/25/2022,"BERLIN (AP) — Germany’s refusal to join other NATO members in providing weapons to Ukraine has annoyed some allies and raised questions about Berlin’s resolve in standing up to Russia. The issue rose to the fore over the weekend following a report that Berlin had gone so far as to block Estonia from supplying old German howitzers to Kyiv to help defend itself against Russian troops massing near the Ukrainian the border. Germany's stance on arms supplies does “not correspond to the level of our relations and the current security situation,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter. Speaking to reporters Monday in Berlin, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz denied a decision had been made on the howitzers and insisted that his country stands with its NATO and European Union allies in opposing any Russian incursion into Ukraine. “Should this situation occur, we will jointly act,"" he told reporters. ""There would be a high price.” Still, while Germany would continue to provide help to Ukraine, there would be one exception, he said: “We don’t provide any lethal weapons."" That stance, criticized in Kyiv and — less loudly — in Washington and London, has caused consternation among some in Germany who worry that their country may not be considered a reliable partner. “How many in Berlin are actually aware how our seemingly confused Ukraine policy harms not just (Germany) but the entire EU?” asked Wolfgang Ischinger, Germany’s former ambassador to the United States and now head of the annual Munich Security Conference. Experts say Germany’s position is partly rooted in its inglorious history of aggression during the 20th century. “There’s the obvious legacy of Germany’s own militarization in Europe during two world wars that has led many German leaders to view any military response as the last resort,” said Rachel Ellehuus, deputy director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia program at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. That attitude could backfire, she said. “The current government does not seem to grasp that sending defensive weapons to Ukraine might actually deter further Russian aggression.” And while Germany has pointed to its restrictive position on arms exports to conflict zones in the past, analysts say the rule has not been consistently applied. ""There have always been borderline cases here, such as the Kosovo war or support for the Kurds against IS in Syria,” said Sabine Fischer, a senior Russia expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. The debate over German weapons was unfolding days after the head of the German navy resigned following criticism at home and abroad for comments he made on Ukraine and Russia. Speaking at an event Friday in India, Vice Admiral Kay-Achim Schoenbach said it was important to have Russia on the same side against China and suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin deserved “respect.” With Scholz's Social Democrats steeped in the legacy of Cold War rapprochement pursued by his predecessor Willy Brandt, and the Greens rooted in a tradition of pacifism, two out of Germany's three governing parties would balk at the idea of supplying arms to a non-NATO country in a conflict with Russia. But letting Estonia pass on the old Soviet-designed 122-mm D-30 howitzers to Ukraine might be an acceptable compromise. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock made clear that, qualms about exporting arms to Ukraine aside, Berlin takes a dim view of Russia's behavior. “In recent weeks, more than 100,000 Russian troops with tanks and guns have gathered near Ukraine for no understandable reason. And it’s hard not to see that as a threat,"" she said during a recent visit to Moscow. Speaking alongside her Russian counterpart — whom she referred to as “dear colleague” — Baerbock acknowledged the “suffering and destruction that we Germans brought upon the peoples of the Soviet Union” during the Nazi era, but warned that Germany was willing to consider tough steps if Russia acts against Ukraine. This includes calling into question the future of the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline meant to bring much-needed natural gas from Russia to Germany. Such a move against its biggest energy supplier would come at a high price for Germany, too. With plans to switch off its last three nuclear power plants this year and phase out the use of coal by 2030, Germany’s reliance on gas will increase in the short term until enough renewable energy comes online, said Georg Zachmann, a senior fellow at the Bruegel economic think tank in Brussels. Yet German officials believe that being a large customer of Russian gas can give it leverage, as Moscow won’t want to harm its reputation as a reliable supplier of gas, painstakingly built up over decades. Speaking Monday at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, Baerbock said the German government's priority is to deescalate the situation over Ukraine, dampening allies' calls for military support to Kyiv and swift new sanctions against Moscow. “Berlin will have to deal with the criticism that is now coming from Ukraine, other European countries and Washington,” Fischer said. “At the same time, Germany remains an important player in the negotiations surrounding the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and, I predict, will continue to support sanctions and other measures in the future.” ___ Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.",World/Associated Press,"German caution on arms to Ukraine rooted in history, energy",https://news.yahoo.com/german-caution-arms-ukraine-rooted-075109850.html
