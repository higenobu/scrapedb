2/23/2022,"If Russian forces try to take new territory in Ukraine, they will face an army that is far smaller and less well equipped than their own but hardened by eight years of fighting. Nearly a decade of war has also left Ukraine with nearly half a million combat-experienced veterans, many now preparing to fight again, officially or unofficially.  That combination, and the sheer size of Ukrainian territory, means that even if Russia can outgun Ukrainian forces on a conventional battlefield, any military clash could lead to a protracted and bloody partisan conflict. “The Russian army has better weapons and technical equipment than us, so we may lose battles or campaigns. But they can never win the country if the Ukrainian people are motivated,” said Serhiy Kryvonos, a retired special forces general and former deputy secretary of the national security and defence council. Kryvonos is travelling the country speaking to veterans and organising weapons training to prepare for a popular uprising should Russia invade. “Look at the experience of Afghanistan. It could not be held by the Soviet Union, by the USA, by the United Kingdom,” he said. “They could not beat the Taliban because they were well motivated. Their strongest weapon was their partisans, civilians by day, then at night they took up weapons to shoot or bury a bomb in the road.” In Kyiv, politicians joke that Vladimir Putin did more to create modern Ukraine than their own parties, by giving them a shared enemy and forcing them to unite around a Ukrainian identity. Putin’s years of aggressive policy towards Ukraine also helped hone the military he may now order Russian soldiers to fight. In 2014, when Russia seized Crimea and Russia-backed forces took control of the east, the Ukrainian army was in such degraded form that soldiers weren’t even getting food. In the years since the collapse of the Soviet Union, discipline had frayed, weapons systems had gone without maintenance for decades, and hardly any of Ukraine’s soldiers had seen combat. “The Ukrainian military in 2014 and the Ukrainian military now are two entirely different things, although without [that army] we wouldn’t have a country at all,” said Taras Chmut, a veteran and military analyst with Come Back Alive, an NGO in Kyiv that supports frontline fighters with equipment and training. “We had a big army, with lots of equipment, but it was old and wasn’t in good condition. Food wasn’t getting to the frontline; people were fighting in jeans,” he said. “Even basic supplies weren’t reaching soldiers, from body armour to first aid kits and communications equipment.” Today, logistics and training have been improved, and the army has expanded by about 100,000 soldiers, to number about 260,000. Chmut estimates that a total mobilisation including veterans and security forces could put more than a million Ukrainians in arms. But when it comes to hardware, Ukraine is still extremely vulnerable. It has a long coastline but, after Russia seized Crimea and its ports, almost no naval capacity. It has no missile defence system, and anti-aircraft defence systems are mostly Russian-made, outdated, and impossible for Ukraine to repair as it cannot get parts. If Russia gains control of the skies over Ukraine, Chmut says he fears civilian slaughter like that seen in parts of Syria, where Russian weapons were used in rebel-held areas. “We are trying to highlight that we need to work on strengthening our air force,” he said. “It doesn’t matter how many people are ready to fight, if the enemy control the airspace, it could be like in Syria, bombing of towns and cities with [a] great number of deaths among civilians.” Kryvonos was concerned that civilians could be targeted with punitive measures, even if they are not targeted by weapons. “They don’t even need to open fire. You can cut off Kyiv’s electricity outside the city,” he said. “The larger the city, the easier to create panic and bring it to its knees. If you cut off power it will become a nightmare in a few days, with no water and no heat.” He said governments had not done enough to warn civilians to prepare supplies of food and water, or even put up signs to bomb shelters. That is particularly worrying because in addition to Russia’s superior force of arms in conventional airspace, it could unleash devastating cyberattacks that would make it harder for Ukrainians to access information as any invasion unfolds. While the government is not moving fast enough for him and many other Ukrainians, people are making their own plans and preparations for the resistance that Chmut says would follow a Russian attack “If it comes to an invasion, it will be total war like in 1939. The whole country will be fighting back, there will be a massive resistance. The west should know there will be a large number of refugees too, maybe 5 to 10 million.” Those determined to fight include Oleg Sentsov, a film director from Crimea who became a national hero after he was detained in his home city in 2014 and convicted of terrorism in a Russian military court. Human rights groups denounced it as a show trial. He spent five years in Russian jails, including in Siberia where the cold severely damaged his health, before he was released in a prisoner swap in 2019. He says he is ready to fight, even as his latest film, Rhino, is feted at festivals. “I will be in uniform. I have some military training and I know how to act in war,” he said in an interview at a central Kyiv cafe, hours before Putin announced his plans to recognise breakaway regions of Ukraine. “The main thing I learned in this life is not to be afraid. In such a difficult time, I will not be the person running from my country.” Additional reporting by Iryna Gorlach.",News/World news,Ukrainians ready for resistance: ‘The whole country will be fighting back’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/ukrainians-ready-for-resistance-the-whole-country-will-be-fighting-back
2/23/2022,"Plugging methane from leaky oil and gas facilities would be free of cost almost everywhere in the world, and in many cases would produce a significant profit, at today’s soaring gas prices, the International Energy Agency has found, suggesting that governments have few excuses for not taking action to curb emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas. Governments have been underreporting their emissions of methane to a dramatic extent, and those emissions are still rising fast, according to the Global Methane Tracker report from the IEA published on Wednesday. Using satellites and other new data, the energy watchdog found emissions were about 70% higher than national governments had suggested, showing the need for far greater monitoring, as well as efforts to staunch leaks.  Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, a leading authority on energy economics, said: “At today’s elevated gas prices, nearly all of the emissions [of methane] from oil and gas operations worldwide could be avoided at no net cost. The IEA has been a longstanding champion of stronger action to cut methane emissions. A vital part of those efforts is transparency on the size and location of emissions, which is why the massive underreporting revealed by our Global Methane Tracker is so alarming.” Russia is one of the biggest sources of methane emissions from its vast oil and gas operations, but few efforts are made there to control the leaks. According to the IEA, Turkmenistan and Texas are also leading sources of leaks. Methane is the main component of natural gas, used for fuel, and also one of the most powerful greenhouse gases, responsible for as much as 30% of the rise in global temperatures to date. About 40% of methane emissions from human activity come from the energy sector, mostly from leaky oil and gas wells and pipelines, or fracking operations, but in many countries few attempts are made to control emissions. Last year, leaks from fossil fuel operations amounted to as much gas as Europe burns for power in a year. If that methane had been captured and used, the current gas crisis and soaring prices could have been largely avoided, the IEA said. The IEA’s findings show that there are few excuses for countries to stall on plugging leaks, which come from poorly maintained pipelines and badly managed production facilities, where the gas can be vented or burned – known as flaring – instead of captured and used. The technology needed to eliminate leaks is widely available: Norway, for instance, has some of the world’s best oil and gas infrastructure, having introduced strict regulation on its industry. Christophe McGlade, lead author of the IEA report, said governments needed to step in to ensure companies used the technology. “One reason companies don’t is a lack of awareness of the problem, or a lack of awareness of how cost-effective abatement is,” he said. In other cases, the company that operates the pipeline or facility may incur the cost of cutting leaks while the benefits accrue to the seller of the gas. “That’s why regulation is very important – policies are needed to correct the market failure, to take on the leaks.” More than 110 countries signed up to a Global Methane Pledge at the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow last November, aimed at cutting methane emissions from all sources by 30% by 2030. But some of the world’s biggest methane emitters have not signed up, including Russia, China, Iran and India. Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser, now with the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington DC, said the IEA’s findings should come as a warning to EU policymakers, amid the crisis in Ukraine and soaring energy prices at home. “Putin has deliberately hidden Gazprom’s massive methane leaks for decades, fooling a complacent Europe,” Bledsoe said. “In fact, Russia’s huge fugitive emissions of methane make its natural gas worse from a climate perspective than the coal it’s meant to replace. It has taken the current crisis for Germany and the EU to recognise that its codependence on Russian gas is a geopolitical and climate nightmare from which they must finally awake. Reducing Russian gas reliance is a huge climate and moral imperative that Europe must prioritise.”",News/Environment,"Oil and gas facilities could profit from plugging methane leaks, IEA says",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/23/oil-and-gas-facilities-could-profit-from-plugging-methane-leaks-iea-says
2/23/2022,"Russian forces massing near Ukraine’s borders can only remain in position for a few days before they have to be sent back to nearby bases or risk their capability being significantly degraded, western officials and experts believe. That means that President Vladimir Putin will come under increasing pressure to use them in a full invasion of Ukraine – or send them back to staging areas, still in Russia’s south or west, but tens or even hundreds of kilometres back.  Such advance positions, often with poor protection from the cold, can be held only for a short period – and there is some evidence on social media of the poor conditions endured by soldiers near the border. Postings spotted by military analyst Rob Lee on Monday showed about 100 soldiers camped out – or rather lying down – at a train station about 20km from Ukraine’s border, without rations and having to buy food for themselves. Russian troops based in Belarus, in forests near the town of Khoyniki, 50km from the Ukraine border, were described by one local a few days ago as people who “drink a lot and sell a lot of their diesel fuel”, suggesting a lack of discipline despite the heightened political tensions. Western intelligence estimates that roughly a third of the overall Russian forces are now believed to be “tactically deployed” in frontline positions “poised for operations”. Their movements have been monitored closely using aerial and other reconnaissance for several weeks, as they edge closer to the border. On Monday, one senior official said they believed it would only be possible for Russia to maintain them in their forward positions for “a matter of days” – a conclusion that is endorsed by independent experts. Nick Reynolds, a land warfare analyst with the Rusi thinktank, said: “If the troops are to be used then they will likely be used very soon, while they are as fresh as possible” and concurred with the assessment that commanders would want to move them on in “a few days” if they are to be effective. Latvia’s defence minister, Artis Pabriks, agreed the next few days were crucial. He argued Putin will test western reaction to his recognition of the separatist territories and the formal deployment of Russian forces there. “They will have a small period of reconnaissance and thinking what the west is doing and what the west is planning. They will assess our responses. And if these responses will not be strong enough or convincing enough, then the next stage will be more incidents on the de facto Ukrainian border,” he said. It remains perfectly possible for Russia to reverse the frontline deployment and return troops to the staging areas they occupied in January, in a similar way to what happened last spring, ready to escalate at short notice once they have resupplied. But, either way, military pressures mean the next few days are likely to be significant.",News/World news,Harsh conditions mean Russian troops near Ukraine will need to be moved soon,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/harsh-conditions-mean-russian-troops-near-ukraine-will-need-to-be-moved-soon
2/23/2022,"It was launched with great fanfare as a “generational reform” that would fund 1,700 new social and affordable homes in Victoria each year. But just five days later, the Victorian government’s proposed social housing levy on developers is in doubt, with the premier accusing the building and property sectors of reneging on a deal to allow them to make “super profits” in exchange for paying the contribution.  The levy, announced on Friday, would see all newly built developments with three or more dwellings or lot subdivisions forced to hand over 1.75% of the expected project value to a social housing growth fund from July 2024. Victorian treasurer, Tim Pallas, said the contribution would affect fewer than 30% of all residential planning permits but raise more than $800m each year, paying for up to 1,700 new social and affordable homes and supporting 7,000 jobs in the construction sector every 12 months. The announcement was immediately met with criticism by the building and property sectors, who said the associated costs were all but guaranteed to be passed on to new homebuyers. On a house valued at the median Melbourne price of $1.1m, the levy would equate to about $19,600. Pushing back against the criticisms on Wednesday, Victoria’s premier, Daniel Andrews, said industry had been extensively consulted on the proposal. He said a deal was struck to introduce the levy in exchange for reforms to Victoria’s planning system, which are expected speed up planning permit applications for major developments by up to six months and make it easier for homeowners to renovate their properties. The government expects the reforms to the planning system will deliver $7bn in benefits over 10 years. “The development industry said to us, ‘Look, if we can get these approvals done much, much faster, then that’s a great thing for us and that’s what we want’. We then quite fairly said, ‘Well that will mean very significant profits for you, how about we share some of those profits to build more affordable housing?’” Andrews told reporters outside parliament on Wednesday. “That was a deal that was done. It was an agreement.” He also hit out at Property Council CEO, Danni Hunter, claiming that her position on the matter had changed. “We’ve now seen that despite the CEO of the Property Council (having) called for these exact measures when that person worked at a different property peak, despite the fact that an agreement had been reached and the outcome of that long dialogue, that deep engagement was they’d support such a profit-sharing model, they now oppose that profit-sharing model,” he said. “So I think it’s fair to say the future of this bill is very, very uncertain. I’m not in the business of creating super profits for developers if they are unwilling to support sharing those profits with those who need more affordable housing.” Chief executive of the Urban Development Institute of Australia’s Victorian branch, Matthew Kandelaars, said he was surprised by the premier’s comments. “There was consultation around planning system reform, improvements to the planning system that were ongoing and constructive. There was never any comment or proposition that was put to me that suggested in any way, shape or form there was a trade off between the development industry and homebuyers funding social housing and securing other planning reform,” Kandelaars said. “The last substantive consultation on social and affordable housing and the industry’s role in that, as far as I’m aware, occurred in late 2019. A lot has changed since 2019 and to see an announcement last Friday and for legislation to be planned … was a big shock to the UDIA and of course to our members.” Kandelaars said he recognised the need for greater funding for social housing but said there needed to be a broader contribution base for the levy. “I’m a homeowner and there’s no reason why I shouldn’t be paying for some of this as well as new homebuyers. It just doesn’t make sense,” he said. “There’s roughly three million ratepayers in Victoria. If you look at a modest contribution on top of rates that’s a lot smaller per person, the impact is going to be significantly less and of course it will be significantly less on a cohort, first time buyers who are already struggling.” Shadow treasurer, David Davis, said a government briefing on the reforms planned for Wednesday evening had been cancelled. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Nobody wants to pay another $20,000 for their home, nobody thought it was fair. The state government has miscalculated on this occasion and wants to take it off the agenda before the election,” he said. “Make no mistake if Daniel Andrews is reelected he will bring this tax back.” Without the support of the opposition, the government needs the votes of five crossbench MPs for the reform to pass the upper house. Four crossbenchers, including Greens leader Samantha Ratnam, have publicly indicated their support, though they hold some reservations. Ratnam said the government had “bowed down to pressure” from developers not to legislate mandatory inclusionary zoning in new developments and instead have introduced a levy that won’t pay for nearly enough housing. “This levy is a compromise. It will go some way to funding more social and affordable housing, but won’t go far enough,” she said. “With a waiting list of 100,000 people, with 25,000 people on any given night experiencing homelessness, we need to build at least 10,000 new public housing homes a year for the next decade to actually meet the current demand for public housing in this state.” Ratnam also described the government’s decision to stop paying council rates from mid next year for social housing properties as a “disaster”. The reform would be phased in over four years from 1 July 2023 and mean the $54m the government currently spends on rates would instead be reinvested into public housing maintenance, upgrade works and better open spaces. Municipal Association of Victoria president, David Clark, urged the government to reconsider the rates exemption. “There are 85,000 social housing dwellings located across the state, many located in a small number of municipalities, and these are bearing an unfair share of the cost burden,” he said. “The cumulative impact of this exemption on rates and charges, coupled with other cost-shifting measures and the ongoing rate cap, places council budgets in a no-win position when it comes to just maintaining, let alone enhancing, much needed community services. As a result, rates will increase.” Both the levy and the rates exemption will apply to all local government areas in metropolitan Melbourne, as well as the regional cities of Ballarat, Greater Bendigo and Greater Geelong. In a statement, the Property Council of Australia said it remained committed to working with the Victorian government to deliver planning reform and to support social and affordable housing. “All our members are concerned about the flow of effects of new taxes on housing affordability and will to work with government to put in place appropriate reforms.”",News/Australia news,‘It was an agreement’: Daniel Andrews’ affordable housing plans bulldozed by peak property group,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/23/it-was-an-agreement-daniel-andrews-affordable-housing-plans-bulldozed-by-peak-property-group
2/23/2022,"A former police officer told Ben Roberts-Smith he was a “weak dog” and warned him “the cover-up is 10 times worse than the offence”, after the decorated veteran allegedly tried to conceal writing threatening letters to a serving SAS soldier, the federal court has heard. Roberts-Smith asked retired officer John McLeod to take responsibility for the letters, McLeod told the court during dramatic evidence on Wednesday.  A former Queensland police officer turned private investigator and security consultant, McLeod appeared under force of subpoena in Roberts-Smith’s defamation action. Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times over reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as acts of bullying and domestic violence. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. McLeod, called as a witness by the newspapers, testified that Roberts-Smith had urged him to take responsibility for sending the letters during a clandestine meeting in Brisbane in 2018. “Just tell them you’re a supporter of mine, and you were sick of the way I was being treated,” Roberts-Smith said, according to McLeod. McLeod told the court he realised two sealed envelopes he’d previously been given by Roberts-Smith to post to an SAS soldier contained threats, but when discussing the letters, Roberts-Smith denied they were threats. “They’re not fucking threats, it’s just a touch-up,” Roberts-Smith allegedly told him. McLeod said he told Roberts-Smith: “If you’ve put me in the frame, if you’ve compromised me, you’d better get me a good lawyer.” McLeod said he urged Roberts-Smith to admit to sending the letters. “If you’ve done something stupid, put your hand up for it, because the cover-up is 10 times worse than the offence,” McLeod said he told Roberts-Smith. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Roberts-Smith again urged McLeod to say he’d sent the letters as a supporter of the Victoria Cross winner. “I said ‘fuck that you weak dog’, and I walked away,” McLeod said. He said he had not spoken to Roberts-Smith since. McLeod was asked about his employment by Roberts-Smith and his then wife, Emma, and the friendship he developed with the couple over a number of years from 2011. The court heard Roberts-Smith paid McLeod $1,500 in 2018 to surveil and film a woman with whom Roberts-Smith was having an affair when she visited a termination clinic. McLeod gave evidence Roberts-Smith also employed him as a “pretend barman” at a party to eavesdrop on employees of Channel Seven where Roberts-Smith was a regional manager. “He wanted to know what they thought of him,” McLeod told the court.

You must approach the inquiry and admit that you have colluded with others to spread lies. “We are very aware of your many murderous actions over many tours in Afghanistan, including specific dates … just like when you took part in the execution of two persons-under-control at Tizak. You know what you have done and so do we.” Person 18 is scheduled to give evidence, called by the newspapers, next week. Last week, Roberts-Smith’s ex-wife, Emma Roberts, told the court that when the letters were made public in June 2018, she confronted her husband. “What the fuck have you done?,” Roberts said she asked Roberts-Smith. “He told me he had written the letters, had printed them at the Seven office, had sealed them in the envelopes, addressed them, and had given them to [family friend and occasional employee] John McLeod to post.” Roberts told the court she had previously seen her husband walk into their house with paper, envelopes and gloves. She said Roberts-Smith had asked her about the PO Box for the SAS regiment in Perth, and whether there were security cameras on post boxes. In his evidence last year, Roberts-Smith denied any involvement in the letters and said the conversation with his wife never occurred. “That’s not true,” he told the court. He told the court during his evidence his ex-wife was “extremely bitter”. “She has done things along the way that have been detrimental to my family, and particularly to me, because she thinks it will hurt me.” On Wednesday, McLeod told the court he was given a blue envelope containing four letters by Roberts-Smith at a Brisbane Bunnings store in 2018. He was given scraps of paper with two names, and later given two PO Box addresses. McLeod posted two letters to Person 18 from a postbox in Tweed Heads, the court heard. He said he did not know their contents. The other two letters – for another soldier known as Person One – were to be thrown out, because Person One was overseas, McLeod said in evidence. He told the court he did not dispose of those letters, but gave them to his lawyer, who later gave them to the Australian federal police. McLeod told the court that the day the existence of the letters was reported publicly, Roberts-Smith summoned McLeod to a meeting in Milton in Brisbane. When McLeod arrived, Roberts-Smith warned him “no phones, no phones, no phones”. McLeod said he and Roberts-Smith discussed the letters, with Roberts-Smith urging McLeod to take responsibility for sending them. McLeod refused. Under cross-examination, McLeod was questioned about his friendship with, and employment by, Roberts-Smith and his wife. The court heard McLeod was employed to do “odd jobs” for the couple, from organising security, picking up dry cleaning, or transporting Roberts-Smith’s medals. McLeod even collected Roberts-Smith’s military uniform after it was thrown out into the rain during his marriage break-up. After severing contact with the former soldier, McLeod maintained contact with Emma Roberts through her best friend, Danielle Scott. Bruce McClintock, acting for Roberts-Smith, said McLeod was an “ally” of Scott and Roberts, following the marriage’s demise. He cited text messages to Scott where McLeod referred to Roberts-Smith as a “prick” and a “psycho”, as demonstration McLeod was hostile to Roberts-Smith. McLeod admitted: “There’s a degree of frustration and disappointment.” The trial, before Justice Anthony Besanko, continues.",News/Australia news,"Ben Roberts-Smith tried to cover up writing threatening letters to SAS soldier, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/23/ben-roberts-smith-tried-to-cover-up-writing-threatening-letters-to-sas-soldier-court-hears
2/23/2022,"As the banks of the Parramatta River steadily rose and engulfed the Powerhouse Parramatta museum construction site on Tuesday afternoon, the state’s politicians in Macquarie Street were arguing about what constituted a one-in-100-year flood. Labor member of the legislative council, Walt Secord, grilled the new New South Wales arts minister, Ben Franklin, during question time. He attempted to table images and video from his phone to prove that the government’s controversial choice of site for the museum – one that will house many of the state’s most valuable and irreplaceable objects from 2025 onward – was misguided and foolhardy.  Franklin, in response, said it was “patently absurd”, “far-fetched and utterly unreasonable” to suggest that the new museum, still in the very early stages of construction, would fail the City of Parramatta Council’s requirement to withstand a one‑in‑100‑year flood level, and that even in the case of a one-in-1,000 year flood, the ground floor of the museum would still remain half a metre above the flood waters. The man Franklin deposed, former arts minister Don Harwin, who drove the Powerhouse Parramatta project from its early days, told parliament he had viewed the same photos as Secord, and there was “a small amount of water over the grass at river level”. In images obtained by Guardian Australia, at least one flooded and abandoned car can be seen on what would normally be a road near the site on Tuesday, which saw 74mm of rain dumped on Parramatta in 24 hours, forcing the ferry jetty neighbouring the museum site to close. “The government, under the previous arts minister … said the museum was going to be built on a site with architectural changes that would mean it could withstand a one-in-1,000-year flood, but the opposition found that it has happened three times in three years,” Secord told parliament. “The minister has disputed that claim in the chamber, but I am relying on footage on the site posted by locals. Even as we were speaking, the entire area was completely inundated.” Local resident and freelance writer Alan Mascarenhas, who lives less than 500 metres from the museum site and captured images and video of the waterlogged site on Tuesday, said locals knew how prone the area was to regular flooding. “It only takes a couple of hours of sustained rain and the whole place is waterlogged,” he told Guardian Australia. “By yesterday afternoon the walkway down there was obliterated on all sides.” For those who’ve asked about the Powerhouse Parramatta site ☂️#SydneyStorm pic.twitter.com/zIN4vEtsQN In February 2019, the NSW State Emergency Service’s senior manager for risk reduction and avoidance, George Jeoffreys, warned that Parramatta CBD residents could have as little as nine minutes warning of flash flooding from the river. Even in a best-case scenario, he said, the best warning the SES could give the public would be only two hours out from an event, making evacuation “difficult, if not impossible”. The $915m Powerhouse Parramatta project’s location on the banks of the flood-prone river has been an ongoing bone of contention between the state government, the opposition and a large group of local residents who are not opposed to a new major museum in the area, but are opposed to its current location. A month before the Parramatta River broke its banks and flooded the construction site in March last year, independent Parramatta-based flood management consultant Steven Molino told a state government inquiry the museum’s proposed one-in-1,000 year scenario meant that in the building’s predicted 100-year lifespan, there was a 10% chance that water was going to get into the building. “If it was an office building with just office furniture and carpets and everything, it wouldn’t matter – if it gets flooded you go down to Carpet Court and buy new carpet, you go down to Officeworks and buy new furniture – it’s all easily replaced,” he told the inquiry. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “But the information we have at present suggests that the electrical power supply will go out [during flooding] and the generators won’t operate the air conditioning system. So you’ll have a spike in humidity … and if you’ve got items in the collection made from paper, textiles, and even wood and some metals, [the museum’s] collection will deteriorate, be possibly irreparably damaged or even lost. “Now the decision might be made that the probability of this occurring is an acceptable risk, but no one has gone through that process.” On Wednesday Infrastructure NSW, the government body overseeing the museum’s construction, issued a statement, using an analysis of Tuesday’s flood data by engineering and flooding specialists Arup. The analysis concluded that “water from the heavy rain event on Tuesday 22 February would have peaked around 4 metres below the future Powerhouse Parramatta ground floor” and would have only entered the museum’s undercroft space, an area not used by the public. “Powerhouse Parramatta will be a very safe building for people to visit and for the collection to be exhibited,” the statement said. “The museum has been designed to withstand large and rare flood events.”",Arts/Culture,Parramatta Powerhouse: NSW arts minister dismisses claims $915m museum is being built on a flood zone,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/23/nsw-arts-minister-dismisses-claims-915m-parramatta-powerhouse-museum-is-being-built-on-a-flood-zone
