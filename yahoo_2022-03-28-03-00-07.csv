3/28/2022,"Tech companies are famous for having some of the world's most challenging and competitive interview processes. That's one reason why rumors tend to swirl around what it takes to get hired at giants like Facebook, Google, or Amazon. According to internet lore, you don't always just have to be prepared to tell a recruiter about your last big win, or your biggest mistake, or where you see yourself in five years. If the rumors are true, you might just have to be ready to answer a challenging math problem on the spot. A viral YouTube video claims that a prospective employee encountered one such problem during an Amazon job interview for software engineers and developers. It went like this:
 A cable of 80 meters is hanging from the top of two poles that are both 50 meters off the ground. What is the distance between the two poles—to one decimal point—if the center cable is: 20 meters off the ground and 10 meters off the ground. Turns out, it's a problem that can be traced back to at least one place, if not Amazon—a 2010 paper in the Atlantic Electronic Journal of Mathematics. If digging through an obscure academic journal isn't exactly your idea of a fun night, fear not: the YouTubers behind the channel MindYourDecisions do a great job of breaking down how to solve the problem and reach the correct answer. Now you can get back to worrying about other things, like where you see yourself in five years.

3/28/2022,"Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Insider's parent company, recently interviewed Tesla CEO Elon Musk. In response to the question, ""what is your biggest fear?"" Musk listed three existential threats. They included a declining birthrate, religious extremism, and ""artificial intelligence going wrong."" Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed three ""existential threats"" he believes currently face humanity during a recent interview with Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Insider's parent company, Axel Springer. The richest man in the world said he fears religious extremism, a declining birthrate, and ""artificial intelligence going wrong."" Death, however, did not make his list. ""I spent a lot of time talking about the birthrate thing,"" Musk said. ""That might be the single biggest threat to the future of human civilization."" Musk has long flagged his concerns of the declining birth rate, a trend that has accelerated amid the pandemic ""baby bust."" A 2021 CDC report found that the US birth rate fell by 4% from 2019 to 2020, the sharpest single-year decline in nearly 50 years and the lowest number of births since 1979. ""I'm really worried about this birthrate thing,"" Musk said. ""That's been troubling me for many years, because I just don't see it turning around. Every year it's worse. And I drive my friends crazy with this."" While the fear of not enough birthing ranked high on Musk's list, the fear of dying did not. ""I certainly would like to maintain health for a longer period of time,"" he told Döpfner. ""But I am not afraid of dying. I think it would come as a relief,"" adding that he would like to live long enough to see SpaceX fully realized. Several of the world's billionaires — including Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos — are on the hunt to discover the scientific fountain of youth. Musk, however, said he has no interest in increasing the human lifespan. ""I don't think we should try to have people live for a really long time,"" he said. ""That it would cause asphyxiation of society."" Musk specifically referenced US politicians who are older than the bulk of the population, an age gap he believes has caused the government to lose touch with the average constituent. ""The truth is, most people don't change their mind. They just die. So if they don't die, we will be stuck with old ideas and society wouldn't advance,"" he continued. On the flipside, Musk said his greatest hope is for humanity to created a ""self-sustaining city on Mars."" ""I would be happy if humanity has a self-sustaining city on Mars because then, probable lifespan of humanity is much greater,"" he explained. ""I think we really just got this little candle of consciousness, like a small light in the void. And we do not want this small candle in the darkness to be put out."" Beyond Musk's goals for the future of humankind, his feelings around personal happiness are less clear-cut. ""For one to be fully happy, I think you have to be happy at work and happy in love. So, I suppose I'm medium happy,"" he said. Earlier this month, Musk split from singer Grimes after welcoming a second child together.
