1/16/2022,"Plans are underway for a new housing development at a former golf course in Pataskala, Ohio, about 30 minutes east of the state capital of Columbus. High Lands Golf Club, which closed in 2019, was recently sold to AV Investment LLC. for $2.5 million. The transfer was final on Dec. 30. High Lands opened in 1957. Kassel Equity bought the course in 2014 and did renovations both to the course and to the clubhouse in the two years that followed. It was considered one of the most affordable clubs at the time, and had been converted to semi-private so members of the public could play. ”I want to express my gratitude for your ongoing support, not only for the time that I have been here, but for the countless years that most of you have been a part of the High Lands Golf Club family,” David Steckel, the club’s interim general manager, wrote upon the closure in 2019. A proposal to rezone the land from agricultural to planned development district has been submitted to the Pataskala Planning and Zoning Commission for the approximately 160-acre site. The rezoning would clear the way for the single-family residential development called The Meadows at Highlands. High Lands Golf Club had recently upgraded its facilities, including a thorough repair of its greens. (Photo by Steve Helwagen/USA Today Network) The development, which would be in the Licking Heights Local Schools District, would have two full access points on Hollow Road SW and one emergency and maintenance-only access point on Alward Road SW. The Meadows at Highlands would feature lots that vary in size from 2-4 acres with more than 75 acres of the property remaining as open space, said Joe Clase, the principal at the land use planner Plan 4 Land, who submitted the rezoning application on behalf of his clients at AV Investment LLC. Clase said during the Dec. 1 planning and zoning commission meeting that all open spaces would be cared for using money from a homeowners association and the property owners envision the golf course’s maintenance facility will remain to take care of the more than 80 acres of open space throughout the development. The original plans stated the subdivision would include 24 lots with a 12-acre park in the center. But Clase said after presenting their plans at the Dec. 1 meeting, the development may have a few more lots and the park may not come to fruition as more space is needed to meet the West Licking Joint Fire District’s standards for roadways. “We’re just trying to figure out what it’s going to look like and how we can address everybody’s concerns,” he said. The commission delayed acting on the rezoning request because they wanted more specifics about dealing with stormwater, minimum square footage for the homes, buffering on the perimeter of the development and other information. Clase said work is currently underway to answer any lingering questions about the development. He hopes to resubmit the rezoning application by Feb. 4, so the planning and zoning commission can consider it at its March 2 meeting. “We just at this point need to work out some of the technical details to make sure the board’s still comfortable with the lot layout and design and we’ll hopefully get that in March, so we can keep moving forward with it,” Clase said.

1/16/2022,"U.S. Sen. Rand Paul hit back at YouTube ""censors"" on Saturday after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention acknowledged that cloth masks do not work as well against the coronavirus as N95 makes. The Kentucky Republican wondered if YouTube would be apologizing for suspending him earlier this year for saying the same thing. ""Does this mean snot-nosed censors at YouTube will come to my office and kiss my … and admit I was right?"" Paul wrote. THUNE SAYS TRUMP'S ELECTION CLAIMS AREN'T PRODUCTIVE IF GOP WANTS TO WIN IN MIDTERMS PSAKI MOCKED FOR SAYING BIDEN WASN'T MAKING 'HUMAN' COMPARISON BETWEEN GOP, SEGREGATIONISTS IN ATLANTA SPEECH In a New York Times article cited by Paul, who is a certified physician, the CDC revised its previous position on masks, saying that ""loosely woven cloth products provide the least protection"" and recommended surgical masks instead. In August, YouTube suspended Paul over a three-minute video questioning the effectiveness of cloth masks, which several studies have shown are not effective in stopping the spread of viruses like the coronavirus. YouTube did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News. The CDC has been blasted for misleading guidance in recent weeks, notably its confusing update on the amount of time those infected with the coronavirus or one of its variants should quarantine and the efficacy of rapid testing. The agency was previously hit for changing guidance on masking, and it continued to add to the confusion this week after the agency recommended that people opt for N95 or KN95 masks for protection against the highly contagious omicron variant. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky has chalked up the CDC's fluctuating health guidance to simply following the science. But her explanation hasn't stopped even mainstream media from asking her why Americans should ""trust"" the agency.

1/16/2022,"A version of this post was originally published on TKer.co. Let’s talk about the CAPE ratio. It’s one of the most widely-followed stock market valuation and investing metrics. It’s being talked about more as investors wonder whether stocks are poised to lose ground in 2022. Unfortunately, the signal of doom it supposedly sends is a myth. CAPE, or cyclically adjusted price-earnings, was popularized by Nobel prize-winning economist Robert Shiller. It’s calculated by taking the price of the S&P 500 and dividing it by the average of 10 years’ worth of earnings. When CAPE is above its long-term average, the stock market is thought to be expensive. Many market watchers use above-average CAPE readings as a signal that stocks should underperform or even fall as it reverts back to its long-term mean. But CAPE’s mean doesn’t actually have much pull. “While valuations feature importantly in our toolbox to estimate forward equity returns, we should dispel an oft-repeated myth that equity valuations are mean-reverting,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a new note to clients. The analysts began their discussion by noting that the problematic assumption that a mean exists for metrics like CAPE to revert to. “Mean reversion assumes that market valuation metrics … are stationary and their long-term means do not change,” they wrote. In recent decades, valuation metrics have been persistently high, which have actually forced these long-term means to move higher. Not long ago, GMO’s Jeremy Grantham made this observation to argue that valuations were in a “new normal” at elevated levels. At any rate, the case for mean-reversion is weak. “We have not found any statistical evidence of mean reversion,” the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote. “Equity valuations are a bounded time series: there is some upper bound since valuations cannot reach infinity, and there is a lower bound since valuations cannot go below zero. However, having upper and lower bounds does not imply valuations are stationary and revert to the same long-term mean.” The Goldman analysts did the math, and the key metric to look at in the chart below is the statistical significance. “The statistical significance over the full sample is 26%. This means that there is only 26% confidence that the Shiller CAPE is mean-reverting, and 74% confidence that it is not. The traditional threshold to consider a relationship statistically significant is 95%.” In other words, you can’t rely on CAPE to gravitate toward any mean. The Goldman analysts, however, weren’t done busting the myth and took issue with the concept of the CAPE ratio in general. “Even if we ignored this threshold, the time between valuations crossing into their 10th decile and reverting to their long-term average is beyond a reasonable investment horizon for a tactical decision,” they said. “For example, the Shiller CAPE entered its 10th decile in August 1989 but did not revert to its long-term mean for 13 years.“ In other words, trading based on the assumption CAPE will mean-revert could lead to indeterminate years of getting smoked by the market. There’s not much new here. The Goldman analysts have addressed this myth in reports published in 2013, 2014, 2018, and 2019. They note that this isn’t just a CAPE-specific issue but an issue with many valuation metrics, including valuation metrics applied to non-US stock markets. I’ve flagged this problem recently here and here. I’ve written about it at Yahoo Finance here and at Business Insider here and here. Prominent folks have been sounding off on CAPE issues for years, including veteran Wall Street strategist Sean Darby, finance professor Jeremy Siegel, legendary investors Warren Buffett, and blogger extraordinaire Michael Batnick. Even Shiller himself has warned about CAPE’s reliability. Still, a simple Google search for “CAPE ratio” will return years of articles about how the market is about to crash. As you can see, it’s being talked about now as stocks have had a bumpy ride to start the year. “We want to emphasize that valuations alone are not sufficient measures for underweighting equities,” the Goldman analysts wrote. “High valuations do not reach some magical target and then revert to some stable mean; furthermore, the time period for valuations to reach some long-term average is highly variable and therefore uncertain.” Valuation metrics like CAPE and forward P/E aren’t totally worthless. By definition, they offer a simple way of estimating the premium an investor pays for a company’s earnings. However, they simply don’t do a great job of telling you what stock prices will do in the coming days, months, or even years. A version of this post was originally published on TKer.co.
