2/1/2022,"The New York Times has acquired the viral word game Wordle for an undisclosed seven-figure sum, the publisher announced on Monday. Created by a Reddit engineer and launched in October, Wordle gives players just six guesses to determine a five-letter word that changes every day. The soothing daily puzzle has become a hit since its launch, quickly attracting hundreds of thousands, then millions, of players. Social media posts about its game of the day have become ubiquitous, along with screenshots of the game’s distinctive grid.  Josh Wardle, who created the game for his partner, who loves puzzles, told the Guardian this month that he felt overwhelmed by the game’s viral success. “It going viral doesn’t feel great, to be honest. I feel a sense of responsibility for the players. I feel I really owe it to them to keep things running and make sure everything’s working correctly,” Wardle said. At the same time, he said, “it’s not my full-time job and I don’t want it to become a source of stress and anxiety in my life.” The New York Times’ crossword editor, Will Shortz, praised Worldle as a “a great puzzle”, and noted: “It doesn’t take long to play, which makes it perfect for our age when people have short attention spans.” Jonathan Knight, general manager for the New York Times Games, told a Times reporter: “The game has done what so few games have done – it has captured our collective imagination and brought us all a little closer together.” The ascent of a “pleasant little daily brainteaser” during the third year of a global pandemic has prompted many reflections on the joys of an earlier, more innocent age of the internet. It has also fueled a tiny cottage industry of game optimization strategies, with mathematicians and linguistic experts weighing in on the best possible first guess. “I think that at this point in life – after ten or so years of a proliferative mode in the online idiom – there is a craving to return to an earlier, slower internet,” the American author Brandon Taylor wrote in a recent newsletter reflecting on the game. Wordle, he said, “re-creates a sense of scarcity within the digital space”. Wardle said in a statement that he was “thrilled” that the New York Times “will be the stewards of the game moving forward” and that he admired the newspaper’s “approach to games and the respect with which they treat their players”. “This step feels very natural to me,” he wrote.

Some reactions on social media remained skeptical: “I’d better not lose my streak when the game moves, or there will be HELL to pay,” one player wrote on Twitter. Wardle wrote in his statement that he was working with the Times “to make sure your wins and streaks will be preserved”.",Arts/Games,New York Times buys viral game Wordle for seven-figure sum,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/31/wordle-new-york-times-buys
2/1/2022,"Journalists in Mexico have responded with fury and despair at the the murder of a fourth reporter in the country this year, cementing the country’s reputation as the world’s most murderous country for media workers. Roberto Toledo was shot dead by three gunmen on Monday afternoon in a carpark in the city of Zitácuaro, where he reported for a local news outlet, Monitor Michoacán. Zitácuaro is best known for the nearby monarch butterfly reserves, but the region is rife with violence as drug cartels and criminal groups fight to control illegal logging.  “Exposing corruption led to the death of one of our colleagues,” said Armando Linares, the director of Monitor Michoacán, in video posted on Facebook. Linares broke down in tears before offering his apologies to Toledo’s family. “[Toledo] lost his life at the hands of three people who shot him in a mean and cowardly manner,” he continued. “We don’t carry weapons. We only have a pen and a notebook to defend ourselves.” The killing deepened the sense of desperation among journalists in Mexico, who accuse Andrés Manuel López Obrador of failing to take meaningful actions to protect them and their colleagues. “In López Obrador’s discourse, he says, ‘the state no longer persecutes journalists’ and he’s correct,” said Javier Garza, a journalist in the city of Torreón. “But he doesn’t stop any of the other actors” from attacking members of the press. In response the recent spate of killings, the president, known as Amlo, has instead blamed the legacy of “neoliberalism” and claimed that political opponents were stirring outrage over the murder of reporters to discredit his government. Adding to the sense of impotence among reporters is the fact that several journalists attacked or killed slain this month were enrolled in a scheme supposedly designed to provide for reporters under threat. “Nobody in authority cares about journalism, unless it helps keep them in power. Let’s not fool ourselves,” tweeted Rafael Cabrera, an investigative reporter. Press freedom organisation the Committee to Protect Journalists counts 32 media workers murdered in Mexico since December 2018 – not counting Toledo’s case – when López Obrador took office. Those most at threat are local reporters investigating links between politics and organized crime. Toledo was the fourth Mexican journalist murdered in 2021. Lourdes Maldonado López was shot dead 23 January as she arrived at her Tijuana home. One of the windows of her vehicle was covered in plastic as colleagues say it had been shattered previously by gunfire. Maldonado appeared at the president’s morning press conference in 2019 and told López Obrador: “I fear for my life.” Tijuana photojournalist Margarito Martínez was killed by a lone attacker in his home 17 January, according to state authorities. José Luis Gamboa was stabbed at least seven times 10 January in the port city of Veracruz. He had commented critically on crime and politics for Inforegio, a news site he co-founded. Two journalists in the states of Yucatán and Oaxaca also survived attacks, according to Mexican media reporters. Journalists staged protests in more than a dozen Mexican cities last week after Maldonado’s slaying. “What makes such a wave of journalist killings possible is that criminal interests – through government inertia, complicity or direct authorship – are almost never properly investigated or punished,” said Falko Ernst, senior Mexico analyst at the International Crisis Group. “There’s near-perfect impunity.”",News/World news, ‘We only have a pen’: fury as fourth journalist killed in Mexico this year,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/mexico-fourth-journalist-killed-roberto-toledo
