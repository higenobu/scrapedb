2/7/2022,"Mike Pence’s former chief of staff Marc Short joined several senior Republicans in rallying to defend the former vice-president on Sunday in his escalating feud with Donald Trump over the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election. Some of Trump’s advisers on the 2020 election were like “snake oil salesmen”, Short said on Sunday.  Pence angered the former president this week by rejecting Trump’s false claim that he had the power to overturn Joe Biden’s victory by refusing to accept results from seven contested states. At a conference hosted by the conservative Federalist Society in Florida on Friday, Pence delivered his strongest rebuke to date of Trump’s election lies, declaring that it was “un-American” to believe that any one person had the right to choose the president. On Sunday, Short, and Republican senators John Barrasso, Lisa Murkowski and Marco Rubio, were among senior party figures who backed Pence’s position, adding their voices to a backlash by other prominent Republican figures apparently growing weary of Trump’s continued obsession with his election defeat and subversion of democracy. “There’s nothing in the 12th amendment or the Electoral Count Act that would afford a vice-president that authority,” Short told NBC’s Meet the Press, describing advisers who told Trump that Pence could send election results back to the states as “snake oil salesmen”. “The vice-president was crystal clear from day one that he didn’t have this authority.” Pence, as president of the US senate, certified Biden’s victory in the early morning of 7 January 2021, hours after a mob incited by the defeated president launched a deadly insurrection on the US capitol. Short, who sheltered with Pence in the Capitol as the mob outside erected a gallows and called for the then vice-president to be hanged, added that his boss had no alternative but to certify Biden’s win. “He was following what the Constitution afforded the vice-president … he was doing his duty, which was what he was required to, under an oath to the constitution to defend it,” he said. “Unfortunately the president had many bad advisers, who were basically snake oil salesmen giving him really random and novel ideas as to what the vice-president could do. But our office researched that and recognized that was never an option.” Short also attacked the Republican party’s position – crystalized this week in a widely derided censure motion for Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, the only two Republicans on the House committee investigating the insurrection, that the January 6 rioters were engaging in “legitimate political discourse”. “From my front-row seat, I did not see a lot of legitimate political discourse,” said Short, who along with the vice-president had to be hustled to a place of safety as the mob rampaged through the building. “They evacuated us into a secure location at the bottom of the Capitol. There was an attempt to put the vice-president into a motorcade but he was clear to say: ‘That’s not a visual I want the world to see of us fleeing.’ We stayed there and worked to try and bring the business back together and complete the work that night.” Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican and ranking member of the Senate foreign affairs committee, agreed with Short’s assessment in an appearance on Fox News Sunday. “I voted to certify the election, Mike Pence did his constitutional duty that day,” Barrasso said. “It’s not the Congress that elects a president, it’s the American people.” Rubio, a Republican Florida senator, told CBS’s Face the Nation that he had long known that Pence lacked the authority to bend to Trump’s will. “I concluded [that] back in January of 2021, when the issue was raised,” he said. “I looked at it, had analyzed it, and came to the same conclusion that vice-presidents can’t simply decide not to certify an election.” Rubio refused to answer if thought the riot was political discourse, but added: “Anybody who committed crimes on January 6th should be prosecuted. If you entered the Capitol and you committed acts of violence and you were there to hurt people, you should be prosecuted.” Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, is among the supporters of an “aggressive” bipartisan effort in Congress, criticized by Trump, to overhaul the 1887 Electoral Count Act and enshrine in statute that a vice-president has no role in deciding a presidential election. “We’ve identified clearly some things within the act, the ambiguities that need to be addressed,” she told CNN’s State of the Union.",News/US news,"Trump’s election advisers were like ‘snake oil salesmen’, ex-Pence aide says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/06/trump-election-advisers-snake-oil-salesmen-mike-pence-aide
2/7/2022,"It was received wisdom that none of Johnson’s former aides now in the private sector were likely to accept the risk of a job back alongside the beleaguered prime minister. Step forward Guto Harri, a former BBC journalist turned PR professional who helped Rupert Murdoch’s News UK after the phone-hacking scandal and worked alongside Johnson during his first term as London mayor in City Hall.  Harri had been working as a director for Hawthorn Advisors, a communications firm founded by Tory co-chairman Ben Elliot. With his previous communications director on the way out, Johnson clearly turned to a familiar face in his moment of need as he faced a vacuum at the heart of No 10 after the “partygate” scandal. Harri, who said he was “proud to join a team of capable, grownup and professional and pragmatic people”, will start immediately in a critical week for Johnson’s premiership. The choice was on one level predictable, as Johnson has often chosen advisers who were longstanding and trusted, such as Sir Edward Lister, Munira Mirza and Ben Gascoigne. However, it is surprising in other ways given that Harri was a staunch remainer in the Brexit debate and had previously been critical of Johnson, saying in 2018 that he believed Johnson would be a “hugely divisive” prime minister. These comments were seized on immediately by Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s former adviser who is trying to bring him down, who tweeted: “Message from No10: ‘So our new boss is a pro-Remain lobbyist who’s said the PM is ‘sexually incontinent’, ‘hugely divisive’, ‘destructive’, ‘dragging the country down’, & picked ‘wrong side’ in referendum’ GREAT.” But Harri has been by no means uniformly critical of the prime minister. He struck a defensive tone towards Johnson on LBC last month, saying people were losing their “sense of perspective” about the story that Johnson was given a cake while happy birthday was sung in the cabinet room in June 2020. “Are we really so prissy, a piece of cake being brought into a meeting is considered sickening?” he said at the time. During a previous media appearance, Harri denied that Johnson was either a “party animal” or someone who was easy to tempt to “wine o’clock” drinks after work. He also told BBC Newsnight that a “really grovelling apology” could help Johnson survive the “toxic” situation, but added: “The problem at the moment is that nobody seems to be getting a grip.” After the news of his appointment, Harri responded to Cummings by highlighting an article he wrote in 2020 predicting the adviser’s demise within the No 10 operation. It described him as a “powerful unelected official cultivating a high profile, disagreeing with the prime minister, undermining the cabinet, picking on special advisers, hiring weirdos who can’t survive a week in public life and providing us all with a detailed running commentary of how wonderful this is all meant to be”. The article contained a defence of the BBC’s place in national life, which contrasts with Cummings’s critical stance towards the broadcaster and could be interesting in light of the government’s plans to abolish the licence fee. A native Welsh speaker who often tweets in Welsh, Harri started his career as a journalist and later became chief political correspondent for the BBC. He worked for Johnson in City Hall between 2008 and 2014 before going into private PR working for Rupert Murdoch’s News UK as it sought to recover from the phone-hacking scandal. He made the news last year after being taken off air by GB News for taking the knee during a discussion about racism towards black footballers. His return to Johnson’s team has thrust him back into the headlines, but his main job will be to see if it is possible to keep his scandal-hit boss out of them.",News/Politics,Keep your friends close: why Boris Johnson hired Guto Harri,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/06/keep-your-friends-close-why-boris-johnson-hired-guto-harri
2/7/2022,"Labour has called for an urgent inquiry into the way A-level results were awarded last year, after reports that private schools in England gave out more than eight times as many top grades compared with before the Covid pandemic. The government scrapped exams in England in 2021 and told teachers to award A-level and GCSE results by assessment, but figures collected by the Sunday Times suggest some schools took undue advantage by massively increasing the rate of top grades awarded to their pupils.  A staff member at a school identified as one of the worst offenders told the Guardian that teachers felt pressurised into awarding the highest grades, while the school’s leaders orchestrated internal assessments to show evidence if queried by Ofqual, the exam regulator, or the exam boards tasked with overseeing the process. School leaders also told teachers who complained about the ethics of inflating grades that the exams boards had given “a nod and a wink” to the practice, and that schools were “all doing it”. In one case of alleged grade inflation, Derby high school went from 6.5% of its entries awarded A* by examination in 2019 to nearly 54% awarded by assessment in 2021. North London Collegiate, a private girls school, nearly trebled the rate of A*s awarded so that more than 90% of its entries were assessed as A*s. The shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said: “Ministers’ chaotic, last-minute decision-making created a grading system which enabled privileged schools to push sky high results unchallenged. “Reports that teachers were pressurised to put up grades show utterly unacceptable behaviour in some schools. An inquiry is urgently needed, including enabling anonymous evidence from staff to uncover how these results went unchecked last summer. “Young people without adults advocating for them have been let down terribly by a government system that was open to abuse. Ministers must get a grip and get a proper plan in place to stop inequalities widening again this summer.” Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP who chairs the education committee, supported the call for an inquiry. An inquiry would probably require the publication of individual school results for A-levels and GCSEs, which the Department for Education (DfE) has so far refused to do. Prof Lindsey Macmillan, of University College London’s Institute of Education, said the DfE should allow researchers access to school and pupil data to enable them to study the 2021 results. An experienced teacher at a private school who spoke to the Guardian said the pressure to increase grades came from senior leaders, rather than from parents. “If you went against it, you met with a few different responses, some of it just stonewalling, others were that ‘exam boards know this is going on, it’s a bit of a nudge, nudge, wink, wink, they know we’re doing this, we know that they know’, it was all a bit chummy. “The other response was ‘other schools are doing the same, so we are just doing what other schools are doing’. But teachers know other teachers from other schools so we were able to compare and know that this was definitely not going on in other schools. “Although we were aware that private schools were more corrupt in their dealings than state schools, there was a spectrum within private schools that we were aware of as teachers. “Many teachers felt very uncomfortable with it, but many felt they couldn’t say anything. Teachers said to me they felt very uncomfortable, and I felt there was nothing we could [do] that wouldn’t unleash a whole load of hell upon our heads, in terms of intimidation or making our lives difficult in a number of ways.” A DfE spokesperson said: “Overall results in 2021 showed success for young people who were targeting top grades from all types of schools and from all backgrounds. The grades achieved reflected the hard work of students and their teachers, and those efforts should not be undermined. “We are clear that exams are the best form of assessment, which is why they will take place this summer with adaptations to maximise fairness for young people.” Ofqual said in a statement: “All school types awarded higher A-level grades last year, when teachers determined their students’ grades, than they did in 2020. All heads of schools and colleges submitted a formal declaration on the accuracy and integrity of grades and processes supporting them.” The rapid increase in overall grades awarded last year – after the abrupt decision to scrap exams when England went into lockdown in January – was first highlighted last August when A-level results were published. The national figures showed that 70% of all A-level grades awarded to private school pupils were A or A*. In comprehensives the figure was just 39%. When the use of teacher assessment was announced by the then education secretary, Gavin Williamson, experts predicted that A-level grades would rise even further than they did in 2020, when exams were also scrapped. Derby high school did not respond to a request for comment.",News/Education,Labour seeks inquiry into huge jump in top grade A-levels at private schools,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/06/labour-seeks-inquiry-into-huge-jump-in-top-grade-a-levels-at-private-schools
2/7/2022,"Ehud Barak, Israel’s then defence minister and the country’s most decorated soldier, warned in 2010 that “as long as in this territory west of the Jordan river there is only one political entity called Israel, it is going to be either non-Jewish or non-democratic. If this bloc of millions of Palestinians cannot vote, that will be an apartheid state.” This argument was made again in 2014 by John Kerry as US secretary of state (though he later regretted the language). Three years later, Boris Johnson, when he was UK foreign secretary, said much the same thing. No one seemed in any doubt that were Israel to carry on without making peace with the Palestinians, the country would face credible accusations of apartheid. After a four-year investigation, Amnesty last week became the latest human rights organisation to level that charge, concluding that Israel operated a “system which amounts to apartheid under international law”. It said that the UN security council must “impose targeted sanctions against Israeli officials implicated”, and demanded an arms embargo on Israel. Amnesty also called for the perpetrators of apartheid to be “brought to justice” through the international criminal court. This is the world’s biggest human rights organisation; its conclusion shows the discussion is becoming embedded in international forums.  Such a grave diagnosis of Israel’s situation should be a concern for all those, like this newspaper, who wish for the country to prosper. Amnesty was attacked by the Israeli government, but defended by more than a dozen domestic human rights groups. Its message is no doubt painful to hear for many Jewish Israelis who consider their country to be a beacon of hope and are proud of its democratic traditions. Yet the continuing subjugation of Palestinians erodes the country’s stature internationally and damages its democracy. There has been an emerging consensus that the term “apartheid” can be applied to Israel in a way distinct from the system seen in the old South Africa. The charge has also been broadened – for some, in a heretical way. It is not just applied to areas under military occupation but used to characterise Israel’s command of the land from the Jordan river to the Mediterranean sea. Palestinians – including those who are Israeli citizens – are, Amnesty says, treated as an inferior non-Jewish racial group and prevented from exercising “fundamental human rights” to varying degrees depending on where they live. As the number of Palestinians in the Holy Land approaches that of Jews, Israel’s predicament becomes more glaring. Neither the country’s prime minister, Naftali Bennett, nor his designated successor, Yair Lapid, will concede that they cannot hold all the territory, keep Israel’s Jewish identity and be a proper democracy. Perhaps this is because Donald Trump backed a rightwing expansionist vision, and several Arab states have normalised diplomatic relations with Israel. Maybe with an Israeli Arab party in the ruling coalition, the government feels insulated from charges of discrimination. Yet land grabs and demolitions continue to dispossess and disenfranchise Palestinians on both sides of Israel’s “green line”, alongside the expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied territories. Last year, protests about the expulsion of Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem snowballed into a clash between Hamas militants and the Israeli army, leaving 250 in Gaza and a dozen Israelis dead. Israel’s leaders may view as victories the continuing de facto annexation of Palestinian land, the laws with constitutional status that enshrine non-Jewish inferiority, and the entrenchment of a system of control. But trends in human and civil rights suggest they will become defeats in the court of international public opinion.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Amnesty’s Israel report: dominating the discourse | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/the-guardian-view-on-amnestys-israel-report-dominating-the-discourse
