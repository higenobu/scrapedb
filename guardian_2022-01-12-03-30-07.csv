1/12/2022,"Boris Johnson could one day regret the appointment of Sue Gray as head of a potentially explosive inquiry into suspected Downing Street parties during lockdown. The senior civil servant has a reputation for vigorous internal investigations – ones that her more career-minded peers decline to touch. Their conclusions have, on occasion, prompted the sackings of ministers and mandarins.  The inquiry, which was launched last month by the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, was primarily asked to look into claims that staff at No 10 held a party on 18 December 2020, when London was subject to severe restrictions. It will now also include the “bring your own booze” event on 20 May that year and a gathering with wine and cheese in the same Downing Street garden five days earlier, pictured by the Guardian. Gray’s appointment came amid a panicky atmosphere in Downing Street, insiders claim. Case stood down in mid-December after allegations emerged of a drinks event taking place within his own office. On the same day, Gray agreed to replace him. She is understood to have studied Case’s work on the inquiry and decided to conduct her own interviews. She has contacted several former members of staff for evidence. Insiders point out that Johnson will still have to sign off the inquiry before it is released to the public and could request “clarifications”. This could delay its publication – it took six months to publish the damning report into bullying allegations against Priti Patel. One admirer of Gray’s work said she would not stand for delays or attempts to influence her inquiry. “The biggest mistake they have made if they want to cover anything up is to appoint Sue Gray because she will investigate the claims and point the blame at those responsible,” the informed source said. Gray began a career as a civil servant in the 1970s, according to reports. After marrying a country and western singer from Northern Ireland, Bill Conlon, she took a career break in the 1980s to run the Cove Bar outside Newry, County Down, close to the border with Ireland. “I loved it, loved it at the time, I’d never do it again,” she told the BBC in May. She was lured back to London to work in the Cabinet Office under Gordon Brown and Tony Blair. She was a “fixer”, according to one former Blair adviser, someone who worked in the shadows to vet potential peerages and smooth over problems. Brown wrote in his memoir: “Like Tony before me and two prime ministers since, I was able to draw on the support of Sue Gray, a senior official in the Cabinet Office, who was always there with wise advice when – as all too regularly happened – mini-crises and crises befell.” She was given a higher profile role in Whitehall under David Cameron. According to the then chancellor, George Osborne, she made an impression on the new government on its first day in office in 2010. “Thirty minutes after the Labour team had left, everyone was fawning at David Cameron,” the former chancellor wrote in a tweet. “Then someone spoke out: ‘I’m sorry PM but you can’t do that.’ ‘Who’s that?’ I asked. Sue Gray.” Gray was appointed as the director general of the propriety and ethics team in 2012. Under Theresa May, she ran an investigation into the then prime minister’s close ally Damian Green. He was subsequently sacked after admitting he had lied about the presence of pornographic images on his House of Commons computer. She also oversaw the Plebgate inquiry into allegations that the then chief whip, Andrew Mitchell, had sworn at and insulted police officers on Downing Street. He stepped down from office over the affair. Gray returned to Northern Ireland to work as a senior civil servant in 2018 but was recruited back into Whitehall in the spring to work with Michael Gove on maintaining the union.",News/Politics,Sue Gray: who is official tasked with investigating No 10 party claims?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/11/sue-gray-official-tasked-investigating-no-10-lockdown-party-claims-boris-johnson

For Partygate, like Watergate, the cynical deceit of the cover-up matches the arrogant stupidity of the initial offence. A hundred people got invitations to the “bring your own booze” party, but until now none thought to make this public. They stayed silent even when, responding to the press conference mockery, Boris Johnson did his Captain Renault impersonation, pretending to be “shocked” that any of his staff made light of lockdown restrictions.

Arguably, 10 and 11 Downing Street are among the most heavily guarded spaces in the country; certainly uniformed police are always evident outside, with who knows how many other officers on duty inside. Surely those police on duty during the party on 20 May 2020 (and, indeed, at all other alleged parties too) had the power to insist revellers leave forthwith and levy a fine on the party organisers? I’d be interested in these officers’ recollections of said events and the actions they took, including who they reported the issues to, as well as any email evidence from their superiors that may explain exactly what led to them so conveniently failing to tackle a breach of the law happening right under their noses.Lynne HammondMundesley, Norfolk  Hard work justifies a party, according to the Tory MP Michael Fabricant.

1/12/2022,"One of the world’s leading makers of pressure washers and steam cleaners has formally asked French politicians not to use its name to score political points. Kärcher, a German family-owned company, issued a statement on Tuesday objecting to rightwing presidential candidate Valérie Pécresse taking its brand in vain. It is the latest of several similar complaints it has issued in recent years.  Last week, Pécresse, the candidate for the mainstream opposition conservative party Les Républicains (LR), said it was time to “get the Kärcher out of the cellar again” to sweep drug dealers and criminals out from the country’s city suburbs. She repeated the comment to French radio, television and newspapers. Pécresse was echoing her predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy who caused a stir in 2005 when, as the Interior Minister, he said he planned to use the company’s pressure cleaner to wash the louts out of the Paris banlieues. Sarkozy had visited La Courneuve after the death of an 11-year-old boy who was killed in front of an apartment block when he was caught in the crossfire of a battle between two gangs. Le Monde reported he said he would “nettoyer au Kärcher” (clean with a Kärcher) the district of 4,000 in a private meeting with the victim’s family. This was not captured on film, but 10 days later he justified what he had said. “The term ‘to clean with a Kärcher’ is the right term because we have to clean up,” he told local youngsters. Contrary to the received wisdom that there is no such thing as bad publicity, Kärcher’s French division said Pécresse’s comments were “misplaced”, “inappropriate” and damaging to the brand. “Kärcher asks political figures and the media to immediately cease all use of its name in the political sphere. This is damaging to the brand and to the values of the company,” it said in a statement. “The Kärcher brand is not the ‘banner’ of any political party … the Kärcher group has been fighting for years to ensure that its brand is not exploited in the French political scene, where it has no place, and is opposed to it being associated with any political party or ideology.” It added that contrary to being good publicity, it was “harmful because it associates Kärcher products with violence and insecurity”. The company said it is “dedicated to cleaning” and noted it had just begun cleaning the Luxor Obelisk at Place de la Concorde – the oldest monument in Paris – in partnership with the ministry of culture. The Germany company has repeatedly asked French politicians to stop taking its name in vain. In 2016 it sent a recorded delivery letter to all 19 presidential candidates asking them not to do so and sent a reminder last August. Pécresse is under pressure after it was reported that the ultra-right candidate Éric Zemmour is having difficulty collecting the 500 signatures from mayors and other elected officials needed to support his presidential candidature. Polls suggest Pécresse stands more change of getting into the run-off of the two-part election in April if the far-right vote is split between Zemmour and the Rassemblement Nationale’s Marine Le Pen. Another blow for the LR candidate was the defection of the party’s former number two, Guillaume Peltier, to Zemmour’s team. Peltier said he had “no confidence” in Pécresse. The latest opinion poll suggests support for Macron, who has yet to declare his candidature, remains stable at about 25%, with Le Pen behind at 17%, followed by Pécresse at 16% and Zemmour at 12%. The Socialist Party candidate Anne Hidalgo is trailing with 4%.",News/World news,German steam cleaner maker asks French politicians not to sully its brand,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/11/german-steam-cleaner-maker-asks-french-politicians-not-to-sully-its-brand
1/12/2022,"The government’s climate agenda is under threat as Boris Johnson’s popularity slumps, according to green campaigners who work closely with the Conservative party. As the prime minister faces further lockdown party allegations, and angry Conservative MPs seek answers over energy price rises and the cost of living crisis, analysts fear the government’s commitment to net zero is facing its most severe test yet.  Tom Burke, a co-founder of the E3G green thinktank and a veteran government adviser, said: “Johnson has been the standard bearer for net zero, and lots of people were happy about that. There is now a sustained assault from the right on net zero. They see the prime minister’s political weakness, and they see net zero as a flank on which to attack him.” Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is meeting backbench Tory MPs this week to calm fears that the squeeze on incomes caused by rising inflation and soaring gas prices will turn away voters, particularly in “red wall” seats in the north of England. He is under pressure from vocal quarters to abandon green measures such as carbon levies, which play a small role in energy bills. Although experts have criticised the government’s net zero plans as falling woefully short on ambition and funding, Johnson is still seen as more engaged with the climate crisis than any of his Tory rivals and has made net zero a personal crusade, with a 10-point plan to “build back greener”, published after the first Covid lockdown. He is influenced by close advisers and allies including his wife, Carrie Johnson, who works for a conservation charity, and his father, Stanley, a prominent “green Tory”, as well as friends such as Zac Goldsmith, the former owner of the Ecologist magazine, whom Johnson appointed as a minister in the Lords. Chris Venables, the head of politics at the Green Alliance thinktank, said: “There is definite jeopardy in Boris Johnson’s weakness, as he has been the champion. But the forces of good are now rallying behind the green agenda. It does help that the facts are on our side.” Johnson’s main rivals in the cabinet – Sunak and the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who are both seen as leadership contenders – have been particularly notable in distancing themselves from net zero efforts. Megan Randles, a political campaigner at Greenpeace, said: “This year there have been more missed opportunities than bold measures by Sunak and Truss. Sunak didn’t mention the climate once in his party conference speech; his spending review failed to kickstart a green recovery, and he is reported to have curbed Johnson’s climate ambitions and hindered Cop26. Truss actively undermined climate action in the Australia trade deal.” On the Tory backbenches, a small but vocal group – the “net zero scrutiny group” – of about 20 MPs has been courting media attention by blaming gas prices on green measures that they say should be scrapped. Analysts and experts have pointed out that the UK’s overreliance on fossil fuels carries most of the blame, and that insulating homes and investing in green energy at home would alleviate the problem. Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at the London School of Economics, warned of attempts to undermine public support for climate action. “The growing crisis around energy prices threatens to delay implementation of the policies necessary to make the net zero target credible,” he said. “There is a small but noisy groups of Conservative MPs, whose voices are being amplified by the usual suspects in parts of the media, who are attempting to mislead the public about the roots of the current crisis, blaming green energy policies rather than the true cause, wholesale prices of natural gas.” Alok Sharma, the cabinet minister who oversaw Cop26, also aimed a coded warning at his party in an interview with the Guardian late last year. He said delivering on the UK’s net zero target must be a “focus across the whole of the UK government” or the achievements of the Cop26 climate summit would be “just a bunch of meaningless promises”. Chris Skidmore, a former energy minister, is also rallying Tory backbenchers to support net zero under the banner of the “net zero support group”. Shaun Spiers, the executive director of Green Alliance, noted: “Fortunately, a few eccentrics aside, the Conservative party is committed to climate action. Business-friendly Tories are pushing for more ambition, while MPs across the country are demanding and celebrating green investment in their constituencies. Net zero and nature are increasingly at the heart of the party, and Boris Johnson can take some credit for that.” Any change of direction to reduce emphasis on tackling the climate crisis could also play badly with voters, who back climate action, argue campaigners. Dave Timms, the head of political affairs at Friends of the Earth, said: “Deep concern about the climate crisis now reaches every part of British society, so the public mandate for the radical action to slash UK emissions is there. The words on every minister’s lips should be delivery, delivery, delivery.”",News/Environment,"Johnson’s political weakness leaves climate agenda at risk, say campaigners",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/11/boris-johnson-climate-action-net-zero-conservative-party
1/12/2022,"Protesters gathered in Fayetteville, North Carolina, for a second night in a row on Monday after a man was killed by an off-duty sheriff’s deputy. The Fayetteville police department identified the man killed on Saturday as Jason Walker, a 37-year-old Black man who the deputy told authorities jumped on to his vehicle. The Cumberland county sheriff’s office identified the deputy as Jeffrey Hash.  In a statement, Fayetteville police said a preliminary investigation revealed that Walker “ran into traffic and jumped on [the] moving vehicle”. “The driver of the vehicle shot [Walker] and notified 911,” it said. Hash, who has been with the Cumberland county sheriff since 2005, was taken into custody but not arrested. On Monday, he was put on administrative leave, pending an internal investigation. By Tuesday, no charges had been filed. The Fayetteville police chief, Gina Hawkins, said data obtained from the “black box” of Hash’s truck revealed that “that vehicle did not impact anything or anyone” but a windshield wiper was torn off and used to break the windshield. Hawkins said the weapon used by Hash was not his service weapon. She did not disclose how many shots were fired or where Walker was hit. Hawkins asked the North Carolina bureau of investigation to “take the lead in the investigation”. Demonstrators challenged the police version of events, gathering outside the Fayetteville transit authority and chanting: “What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now.” Elizabeth Ricks, a trauma nurse, told WRAL News she was on the scene and tried to save Walker’s life. “I did not see anyone in distress. The man was just walking home,” she said. “It breaks my heart he didn’t survive and I’m trying to cope with that as well. I don’t want to take away from Jason or the injustice and I’m not going to be silent.” A cousin of Walker told WRAL News the police chief’s description of events did not sound like something Walker would do. “We’re hearing one side of the story that sounds like a person that Jason is not, and then on the other side, we’re hearing a story that makes complete sense,” said the cousin, who was not identified by name. “We have to take it one day at a time. Hopefully the system does what’s right and gets to the bottom of this. We really just want justice for Jason.” According to Walker’s family, he was a single father and left behind a young son.",News/US news,Fatal shooting of Black man by off-duty officer sparks protest in North Carolina,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/11/north-carolina-police-fatal-shooting-black-man-jason-walker
1/12/2022,"Labour has accused the government’s flagship national tutoring programme of failing children and taxpayers after official figures revealed take-up rates way below target. Just 10% of this year’s target for children receiving one-to-one or small group tutoring from NTP tuition partners has been reached so far, with figures showing headteachers in England favouring their own school-led tuition programmes over the national scheme, which was controversially awarded to the Dutch multinational Randstad.  The NTP progress report coincided with the latest official school attendance figures, which showed nearly 5% of state school teachers in England were absent because of Covid infections on the very first days of the spring term. The Department for Education (DfE) figures also revealed that more children stayed off school last week because of Covid than at the end of last term, with 315,000 students and pupils absent for Covid-related reasons – 3.9% of all pupils nationally and 14,000 more than on 16 December. On catchup, the DfE said pupils in England began just over 300,000 tutoring courses last term and insisted that the NTP was on track to deliver its target of 2m courses this academic year. Of those already under way, an estimated 230,000 were school-led tutoring packages, while just 52,000 were provided by the national scheme, far short of the 524,000 target for this academic year. Another strand of the national scheme, which involves tutoring through academic mentors, has so far started 20,000 courses, out of a target of 252,000. Randstad was awarded the NTP contract last June after it put in a bid substantially lower than its rivals. A separate school-led tutoring route was also set up, with schools receiving £579m directly to employ their own catchup tutors. The shadow schools minister, Stephen Morgan, said: “Covid learning loss threatens to limit the life chances of a generation of our children, yet the government’s flagship tutoring scheme has reached less than 10% of pupils targeted. A third of the way through the school year, this cut-price contract is failing children and the taxpayer.” Nick Brook, the deputy general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, added: “The government’s tutoring revolution risks stalling unless more is done to ensure that high quality easy-to-access tutoring support is available to every school, for all pupils that need it, in every single part of the country.” Robin Walker, the schools minister, said: “We know there is still work to do, but it’s hugely encouraging to see so many students from all backgrounds have been directly reached through the government’s tutoring programme and I encourage all schools to take advantage of it.” A Randstad spokesperson said: “We are really pleased to see how many pupils have already benefited from catch-up tutoring through the programme this academic year. We are continuing to work closely with all of our stakeholders to ensure we deliver an ambitious and high-quality programme at pace, for schools to help their pupils whose education has been most impacted.” On attendance, the January total includes 159,000 pupils absent with confirmed cases of Covid and 102,000 with suspected cases – but it does not include those isolating after a positive PCR test result, who are defined as ill. More worryingly, the figures also show rising numbers of staff absences. Among teachers and school leaders, 4% were off on 6 January with a confirmed Covid infection, nearly double the 2.2% absent for the same reason on 16 December. Among teaching assistants and other school staff, 5% were off with a confirmed Covid infection, compared with just 1.5% on 16 December.",News/Education,"National tutoring programme has failed pupils and taxpayers, says Labour",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/11/national-tutoring-programme-has-failed-pupils-and-taxpayers-says-labour
1/12/2022,"Trevor Bayliss, the World Cup-winning former England head coach, has emerged as the in-house favourite to take charge of the Australian men’s team should Justin Langer’s contract not be renewed after the Ashes. The Guardian understands Bayliss is the preferred candidate to be the next head coach among the current support staff and senior players after a 12-month period that has delivered on-field success yet seen Langer’s methods questioned behind the scenes.  Sourced reports of player dissatisfaction at the 51-year-old’s supposedly intense and volatile approach first surfaced after the 2-1 defeat by India last January and led to several rounds of clear-the-air talks. Cricket Australia even released a statement last August backing the head coach, who is under contract until June 2022. But while Langer’s recently stated hopes of a renewal appeared to be strengthened by Australia’s surprise victory at the T20 World Cup and the current 3-0 Ashes scoreline going into this week’s fifth Test in Hobart, Pat Cummins, the Test captain, notably declined to discuss the matter after the win in Melbourne. Cummins said: “We’ll all sit down together after this series or whenever his tenure is up. His contract is up for renewal in a few months and we’ll deal with that then.” Andrew McDonald, the popular assistant coach, is viewed by many inside Australian cricket to be a future head coach of the men’s team and has been a beneficiary of the previously hands-on Langer being forced to delegate more responsibilities to his support staff since discussions with the players. But over the course of the current Ashes series a belief has grown in the set-up that the more experienced Bayliss would serve as an ideal immediate successor to Langer given a track record of setting up relaxed, player-led environments. Bayliss, 59, remains hugely popular among the large New South Wales faction of the Australia dressing room from his two previous spells coaching the state side – most recently 2013 to 2015 – and also has strong links with its most prominent member, Cummins, through Penrith Cricket Club. Since stepping down as England head coach in 2019 – a four-year stint that returned an Ashes win in 2015 and the World Cup four years later – Bayliss has worked on the franchise T20 circuit and currently heads up Sydney Thunder in the Big Bash League. Asked about his ambitions last June, Bayliss told the Sydney Morning Herald: “The only full-time job I’d contemplate in the future if it came up would be the Australian job. But I’m very happy coaching two or three of the franchise teams around the world.” Ben Oliver, Australia’s performance director, has said a consultation process over the head coach role involving players and staff will begin after the conclusion of the Ashes, but played down suggestions of splitting the role by way of format.",Sport/Sport,Trevor Bayliss in frame to succeed Justin Langer as Australia head coach,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/11/trevor-bayliss-australia-cricket-head-coach-justin-langer
1/12/2022,"For a country without a written constitution, the UK was fortunate in having the authoritative and industrious Anthony Bradley among its leading constitutional experts. His work, spanning seven decades, shone a clear light on the sometimes ill-defined legal framework that underpins the modern state and expanded public scrutiny of government powers. Bradley, who has died aged 87 of pulmonary fibrosis, was principal author of the standard textbook on constitutional law, served on the influential House of Lords constitution committee and taught a generation of judges at the universities of Edinburgh and Cambridge.  In his mid 70s, having embarked on a second career as a barrister, he presented arguments to the law lords on behalf of exiled Chagos Islanders who are still unable to return to their homes on the Indian Ocean archipelago. One of his most innovative cases involved a courtroom battle in the early 90s against the home secretary, Kenneth Baker, over the deportation of a teacher to what was then Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) who was still pursuing an asylum claim in the UK. The House of Lords eventually found that the home secretary and his officials were in contempt of court by unlawfully removing the teacher, establishing the principle that ministers are subject to court orders and enforcement proceedings can be brought against them. The lawyer and former appeal court judge Stephen Sedley, who worked on early stages of the case with Bradley, described him as “a living resource with his compendious – though never flaunted – knowledge of constitutional and public law”, adding that “the quiet genius behind it all was Tony”. One distinguished legal commentator, HWR Wade, described the judgment as the most important legal decision in 200 years. Bradley’s international renown was such that he was involved in drafting new constitutions for Montenegro, Palestine and even the amalgamated trade union Unison. Liberal Democrat and pro-EU in political sympathies, his writings were nonetheless quoted widely in parliament by a range of MPs, including the Eurosceptic Bill Cash. Anthony was born in Dover, Kent, where his parents, Olive (nee Bonsey) and David Bradley, ran a dyeing and dry-cleaning business. At Dover grammar school he was known as “Prof” due to his love of studying. He lived up to his nickname. After national service with the Royal Army Education Corps, Bradley won a scholarship to study law at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He graduated with a starred first in 1958. Completing his training as a solicitor with the town clerk’s department in Reading, he secured another prize in his qualifying exams. Music was an abiding passion and it was at a Bach choir in Reading that he met Kathleen Bryce, a nurse who later became a health visitor. They married in 1959. Bradley returned to Cambridge University the following year as a law lecturer, taking time out to help establish a law faculty at the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. At the age of 34 he was appointed, in 1968, professor of constitutional and administrative law at Edinburgh University. In 1965 he had begun editing Constitutional Law, a reference work first published in the 30s and already in its seventh edition. At Edinburgh in 1977, he relaunched it as Constitutional and Administrative Law; it became crucial reading for law students and is cited widely in UK court cases and foreign jurisdictions. Bradley continued working on updates until 2014. Highly organised, Bradley was also known for his kindness and charm, and the encouragement he gave to others. His daughter, Charlotte, recalled Christmases during which foreign students who had no homes in the UK would share family festivities. He hosted parties and liked to play the viola. His musical tastes were not limited to the classical; he was a fan of the band Manfred Mann. In 1989, he took early retirement from Edinburgh and joined Cloisters Chambers in London to train as a barrister; he was older than his pupil master. One of his first tasks was travelling around the country preparing compensation cases for women who had been sacked by the army when they became pregnant. His academic background and ability to see both sides of an argument may not have been ideal preparation for partisan argument, which occasionally left him bemused at the discourtesy of opponents. As well as fighting courtroom battles, Bradley gave expert evidence to parliamentary committees and commissions. One of his most important roles was as legal adviser between 2002 and 2005 to the House of Lords constitution committee, a body at the forefront of monitoring constitutional and legal developments. He was the UK ’s nominee on the Venice Commission, an advisory body to the Council of Europe, which supports development of democratic constitutions and the rule of law. Bradley was appointed an honorary QC in 2011. He continued giving lectures and writing articles for newspapers, including the Guardian. Among other roles, he was chair of Asylum Welcome, a charity that helps refugees in Oxfordshire. In 2019 he welcomed the “clinical precision” of the supreme court ruling, in the case brought by Gina Miller and his former student Joanna Cherry, which found that Boris Johnson acted unlawfully in proroguing parliament.

Only a few days ago, there was an article about new supermarkets where we have no interaction with people at all; we simply take goods off the shelves and walk out. For many, the workplace is vital for meeting people outside our family circles, a place where we can exchange ideas about work and life in general, banter and form close relationships.

George Eustice and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs are planning to pay landowners (mostly not farmers) to rewild land. That is, pay huge sums of public money to extremely rich individuals to do almost nothing. Wealthy businessmen have bought agricultural land to avoid tax, to benefit from its exemption from inheritance tax. They will now be paid to evict tenant farmers and stop food production on that land. Can this be justified by the positive impact on the environment? No.  When the UK produces less food, we don’t consume any less, we buy it from abroad. Our farming has the highest environmental standards in the world. So importing food, rather than producing it in the UK, means increasing environmental damage. We need to produce food through carbon neutral and sustainable means.
