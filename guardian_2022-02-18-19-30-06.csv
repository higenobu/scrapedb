2/18/2022,"Two major storms in a week may have come as a shock, but trouble has been brewing for some time. The Pacific around the equator is in the throes of La Niña, when the seas turn cooler than normal towards South America. Even though thousands of miles away, La Niña often brings a wet and windy end to winter in the UK, with a powerful jet stream driving depressions across the Atlantic. And as the core of the jet stream powered to more than 200mph this week, Storm Eunice rapidly exploded into a ferocious storm. Not only that, but the vortex of winds whirling around in the stratosphere high above the Arctic are unusually strong this winter, helping drive westerly weather across the Atlantic.When will it all end? The signs are that windy, wet weather could last into March before La Niña weakens and the polar vortex decays. Looking on the bright side, the wet westerly winds are boosting water supplies in many parts of the UK, where it had been unusually dry, and wind power generation has surged this week. And despite the battering from storms, this winter has also been mild over much of the country.",News/News,When will wet and stormy weather end in the UK?,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/18/when-will-wet-and-stormy-weather-end-in-the-uk-storm-eunice
2/18/2022,"A doctor who was stabbed nine times in a random, unprovoked attack has said he feels a “sense of connection” with his attacker, whom he told in court: “I am not upset or angry with you.” Dr Adam Towler, a former trauma specialist from Bristol, drew praise from a judge who described his response to his disturbing attack in 2019 as “extraordinary”.  Towler, who develops medical software, was stabbed repeatedly by then 17-year-old Chanz Maximen, including with a blow that missed his heart by two centimetres. Maximen knocked on Towler’s door and shone a light through his letterbox, leading the doctor to think a prank was being played; when he opened the door, Maximen pulled him into the road and stabbed him. As Maximen was jailed for life with a minimum term of 12 years on Wednesday, his motive for the attack is still not fully understood. As is customary, a victim impact statement was read at the sentencing hearing – but the tone of Towler’s missive has turned heads with its forgiving and philosophical nature. “To begin, I want to say that I am not upset or angry with you,” Towler said. “I don’t think you owe me an apology or anything, but I do want to you to know what it’s like for me.” Judge William Hart described Towler’s statement as “extraordinary”, saying: “Whether it is the effect of intellect, or faith, or kindness and understanding, I don’t know. “If it is the consequence of intellect, I admire it. If it is the consequence of faith, I envy it.” Expanding on the thoughts behind the statement on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Friday, Towler said: “The fact we’re here talking today, I got lucky. I’m living a quite normal life, a comfortable life. My immediate outlook is rather more comfortable than Chanz Maximen’s position. “I guess also in some odd way I felt a sense of connection with him. He and I were two individuals connected in this event. I haven’t been able to speak to him … “But I don’t feel angry with him. What happened, happened. Neither of us can unwind the clocks on those events so now I have the rest of my life before me and he does, too.” Towler added: “No one knows what he thought, what he does think, no one knows whether he will be judged safe to return to society but his whole life turned on that event. Prior to this, there was no mental history, he was on a good course and that may be difficult for him. I know it’s certainly difficult to his family who have supported him with great tenacity and loyalty through the legal process.” He said it would be “cool” if his approach helped others to think differently. “If the approach stimulates a thought in some other people, perhaps gives them some tools to think differently about a difficult situation they’re experiencing, then that’s cool. I think in these situations, there’s no right, so go with it,” he said. During the attack, Towler said Maximen had said “you killed the girl”, a phrase that he has never explained and that meant nothing to the victim or investigators. Sentencing him for the stabbing and two more random attacks carried out in Bristol in the following weeks, the judge said: “There is no logical explanation for any of your offending other than that you are a highly dangerous young man with a wholly distorted view of life and appropriate conduct.”",News/UK news,Doctor stabbed nine times tells attacker: ‘I am not angry with you’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/18/doctor-stabbed-nine-times-tells-attacker-i-am-not-angry-with-you

2/18/2022,"Last summer I got a tattoo on my forearm. It was a frame from a Chris Ware graphic novel showing a nervous man cringing in shock from the noise of a telephone, represented by the word “RING” in huge red script. It was the first of my tattoos to involve any colour, the rest all being black line-drawings. When I woke the morning after I looked down and saw, rather than the familiar image, a nightmarish, enormous smudge of angry red that covered 8in of my arm. In my half-asleep state this sight put the fear of God into me and I leapt out of bed, mind racing. For a minute or so, before I could unravel the bandage and investigate the area properly, I believed that something had gone terribly wrong and I was now to have an entirely red forearm for the rest of my life. I did panic, admittedly, but then something surprising happened – I rapidly reconciled myself to this new life I was to lead with a red arm. I even managed to laugh. It wasn’t that I would enjoy looking at the hideous mess, but rather that I thought I would easily come to enjoy its presence in my life, even though it was a mistake. Why? Because it would have been my mistake, something that happened to me and only me. It would have been a part of my one, unreproducible life.  Soon I managed to clean myself properly, carefully removing the layers of co-mingling sweated-off red ink and blood that had become trapped and spread beneath my bandage. I was relieved to be looking at this image I love so much, beautifully rendered. And yet to the Melanie Phillipses of this world, that image would be just as repellent to look at as my insane red hellscape tattoo. Phillips revealed in a column last week that the sight of tattoos makes her feel physically ill. She feels that the contemporary normalisation of the tattoo – an intervention once reserved in our culture for sailors, carnival folk and criminals – reveals a crisis going on in secular society. Phillips has attracted plenty of mockery for her take, but it’s a familiar, if hysterically expressed, opinion. Plenty of people, young and old, have expressed prurient disapproval of my tattoos. Usually they are either annoyed that I don’t have some wonderfully meaningful reason for each of them or they ask if I’ll regret it on my wedding day. Admittedly, I have not done much to avoid these criticisms, given my array of dazzlingly pointless tattoos. I have 13 of them now, and rather than an aesthetic grand plan, they form a haphazard collection of unrelated, impulsive doodles. Personally I like the casual vibe the whole nutty array gives off, perhaps because in a way I actually agree completely with Melanie Phillips: my tattoos are a kind of undermining of the sanctity of my body. It’s just that we have exactly diverging perspectives on the nature of this nihilistic desecration. For years my body was a site of constant and violent conflict. When I wasn’t hurting, starving, or loathing it, I was in a fugue state of denial that it had nothing to do with “me” – whatever “me” was. It was just some abstracted mistake to cope with. Yet it mattered to me enormously, as did its aesthetic pristineness – the very quality I would eventually come to violate with my tattoos. I am anecdotally aware of many people who have purposefully used tattoos as a way to reclaim their traumatised bodies, choosing the locations of their scars or areas of the body they once particularly hated. It was far less intentional than this for me, but in the eight years since I started getting tattoos I have repaired my relationship with my body. I don’t jump for joy at the sight of myself naked, but nor do I feel any resentment or ill will toward it. I enjoy the things my body does for me. I thank it for withstanding its years in the wilderness of my neglect and cruelty, for persisting so I can now run without stopping in shame over my ineptitude, and have sex without second-guessing how I am being viewed, and view a new foreign place in terms of how much I will enjoy to traversing it all on foot. I know how lucky I am to be able to do these things and how lucky I am to finally feel gratitude for them. I also know how fleeting these abilities of mine are. Indeed, this is part of why I am able to value them. Even in a healthy, lucky, long life, we start out dependent on others and eventually die that way too. No matter what our physical capabilities, or our level of fitness or beauty, the years in which we enjoy our bodies at their peak condition are always going to be vanishingly, harrowingly few in the grand scheme of things. For me, my silly, ill-considered, multiple tattoos are one way to acknowledge this tragi-comic reality – that, unbelievable as it may seem, this body, which is often submerged in pleasure and activity, is also marching me towards death. It’s absurd, it’s unbearable, it’s an irresolvable agony that is best addressed by a £50 permanent doodle of a pissed Mickey Mouse waving a bottle of hooch, which will eventually join me in the grave.

2/18/2022,"If any evidence was needed to prove European clubs are increasingly looking to Major League Soccer for talent, it came in the January transfer window. No fewer than 33 players left North American soccer’s top flight to head across the Atlantic with two of those players (Daryl Dike and Ricardo Pepi) entering the list for the top five most expensive transfers in MLS history. Bundesliga club Augsburg made Pepi their club-record signing while Dike joined West Brom. Teenager Kevin Paredes left DC United for Wolfsburg, James Sands signed for Rangers on loan from New York City FC and George Bello joined Arminia Bielefeld, having made his breakthrough at Atlanta United. Even after the January transfer window closed, Arsenal completed a deal that will see US men’s national team goalkeeper Matt Turner move to London this summer.  Each will hope to follow the precedent set by the likes of Alphonso Davies, Weston McKennie and Tyler Adams, who all used MLS as a springboard to top European clubs. All this business marks a fundamental shift in MLS. Once derided as a ‘retirement league’ due to the number of ageing stars lured to Canada and the United States by the promise of one last bumper pay cheque, the competition is now more concerned with producing, or at least harnessing, stars of the future. Far from being a retirement league, MLS is now a development league. This hasn’t happened by accident. A greater emphasis has been placed on youth development in the post-David Beckham era. The reliance on the college game for homegrown talent has been systematically eased. MLS has brought youth development in-house with a new youth-focused division, MLS Next, set to start play this year. The idea is that a more holistic network of more than 130 clubs will aid mobility between the levels of North American soccer for the best players. Some clubs have already created a youth academy industry for themselves. Pepi certainly wasn’t the first graduate shipped to Europe by FC Dallas who have earned a reputation as American soccer’s most productive club when it comes to youth. Other clubs have followed FC Dallas’ lead. The New York Red Bulls boast a highly productive academy that has forged the likes of Adams, Duncan and Caden Clark while the Philadelphia Union have sent Brendan Aaronson and Mark McKenzie to Europe in recent times. In the past, scouts would explore American soccer in the hope of unearthing a gem. Now, scouts expect to find such jewels. MLS is producing young players tailor-made for the modern game. For decades, American soccer prioritised athletic ability over all else. US teams were known for working hard and giving it their all, but as the sport started to value technical ability over physical capacity it became clear a change in approach was required. There may still be some vestiges of the old prejudices and preconceptions left over, but those in the know recognise how North American soccer’s conveyer belt is rolling off players in a very different mould than was the case even 10 years ago. The current talent pool is deep with dynamic ball-players. It’s no coincidence that American youngsters are now more attractive to European clubs than ever before. In terms of the product on the pitch, it’s debatable whether or not MLS’s convoluted transfer rules and general structure has helped or hindered the league. It does, however, help give many young players their start in the professional game. Academy graduates are afforded opportunities they wouldn’t receive in other leagues. By constructing a division led by top-level players, like Javier Hernandez and Carlos Vela, underpinned by academy prospects, MLS has, perhaps inadvertently, created the ideal environment for youth development. Of course, MLS clubs still spend money on big-name signings. Toronto FC haven’t long landed Italy attacker Lorenzo Insigne on a four-year contract worth a reported league-record $15m-a-year. Before Insigne’s signing, Hernandez and Vela were the highest-paid players in the league, each taking home $6m or more a-year. Gonzalo Higuain, Alejandro Pozuelo and Josef Martinez also currently play in MLS. But there is no denying the increased emphasis on youth across MLS. For American and Canadian soccer, the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted across the two nations and Mexico, is a guiding light and is almost certainly a motivating force behind the youth drive on both sides of the border. If Canada and the USA perform well at Qatar 2022 and the 2026 World Cup, their success will have its roots in the academies of their shared top-flight. The relationship between MLS and US Soccer has been too cosy for the liking of many who believe the two organisations would benefit from a greater degree of separation, but their union is now bearing fruit in the young players coming through the system. Last month didn’t happen by accident and there may be many more months like it in the future.",Sport/Football,How MLS sparked North America’s invasion of European football,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/18/how-mls-sparked-north-americas-invasion-of-european-football
2/18/2022,"My earliest reading memoryWhen I was six, I went with my mother and sister to India for the first time, to visit relatives. Here I discovered comics. My cousins were obsessed with Archie comics, which I didn’t really understand but found very readable. My masa gave me my first ever Spider-Man comic on that trip, a classic tale featuring the Green Goblin. I read it over and over again, the entire six weeks we were there.  My favourite book growing upMy mum used to take me to the library every two weeks: she had a Mills & Boon addiction to feed. I had free rein of the library and I worked my way through every single movie tie-in novelisation I could find, as well as expanded universe Star Wars and Star Trek books. I think my most treasured book was The Karate Kid Part III. The books that changed me as a teenagerOn my weekly trips to Calamity Comics in Harrow town centre I would sit at the back of the shop, reading Spider-Man comics. Peter Parker is me. I am Peter Parker. Which means I could be Spider-Man. Those comic books made me feel less alone. The writer who changed my mindOn my 21st birthday, the singer Deedar Zaman, then the frontman of my favourite band, Asian Dub Foundation, gave me a copy of James Baldwin’s The Fire Next Time and it changed my life. Asian Dub Foundation had already introduced me to so many different movements and people by then, from Udham Singh to the Naxalite movement to the Bradford 12 to the case of Satpal Ram, and my anger and interest were growing. Then Baldwin wrote: “Do I really want to be integrated into a burning house?” in a letter to his nephew and I knew I had to read everything he’d written. His simmering moral fury, the elegance of his prose, the complex compound sentences that were wise and world-weary and hopeful: they were everything to me. The book that made me want to be a writerZadie Smith’s White Teeth had a huge impact. On the surface, it was a book about people I was familiar with, in a part of London I grew up in, using the language of my friends. And then she wrote: “There was England, a gigantic mirror, and there was Irie without reflection”, and I knew I had stories of my own to tell. White Teeth was many things, but my sense of it at the time was that it was so funny. I was a student of sitcom, and White Teeth showed me how to be funny on the page. The author I came back toThe rapper I didn’t really appreciate at the time but revisited as an adult is Jay-Z. The flow, the timing, the metaphors, the sense of humour, the storytelling and that warm chuckle. The book I rereadI read Hanif Kureishi’s The Buddha of Suburbia again recently and I still love it. As a teenager, it made me feel seen and more OK with how much of an outsider I felt, and really made me understand my place in the world. Rereading it now, I find it’s filled with mischief and joy and moments of silliness, and ridiculous characters who walk the line between pathetic and absurd. It’s one of the funniest books ever written. The book I could never read againFrank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns was a seminal piece of work. It was the blueprint for so much that came after it, from how we viewed a superhero’s place in society through to dark, gritty films like Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy. However, I cannot help but draw a line between Miller’s Batman and the hooded bat-like “hero” of his grossly Islamophobic book, Holy Terror. The book I discovered later in lifeI read Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean Rhys on holiday, and couldn’t understand why it had taken me so long to get to it. The books I am currently readingI am enjoying Samira Ahmed’s new run of Ms Marvel comics. Roopa Farooki’s jaw-dropping memoir, Everything Is True, about being a junior doctor in the first six weeks of the pandemic, is brave and powerful. I am also reading Pankaj Mishra’s novel, Run and Hide, a satirical look at finance bros. My comfort readDuring a recent period of grief, when I lost someone close to me who was as big a rap head as I was, I found myself rereading Hanif Abdurraqib’s Go Ahead in the Rain, about A Tribe Called Quest. The book is haunted by Phife Dawg, a former member who died in 2016; the way Hanif talks about him and to him made me feel closer to my cousin.

2/18/2022,"Peter Jackson recently reignited passionate awe with The Beatles: Get Back: his epic, intimate eight-hour TV re-edit of Michael Lindsay-Hogg’s documentary footage for Let It Be, about the recording of the Beatles’ 1970 album. The centrepiece has been released as a standalone event in cinemas – initially in large-format Imax, but now also in conventional theatres. This is the legendary and mysteriously intended rooftop concert, in which the band (with guest keyboardist Billy Preston) played atop the Apple offices in Savile Row, London, in the freezing cold, for stunned or curious observers who had clambered on to the neighbouring roofs, and for the cheerful crowds below.  The cameras captured the event, and the amazing 60s faces of Londoners at street level and up there on the roof: some looking bored, like the indifferent onlookers at Calvary depicted in Jan Van Eyck’s Crucifixion and Last Judgement. Most hilariously, there are also the nonplussed coppers – one with a Blakey/Hitler moustache – intent on shutting the whole thing down, who were cheekily being stalled down in reception for as long as possible. A few people ask “Why?” Who were the Beatles performing to, and for? It’s a good question, and this film is unmissable despite, or because of the fact, there is no answer. Did they want to get back to their rock’n’roll roots? Not exactly. This was a public concert that was exalted, way above the public, which most of the public couldn’t see (the band don’t even peep over the roof’s edge to wave). In that pre-social-media age, word didn’t really get out until it was all over. Did the Beatles really, in their hearts, believe that this would kickstart a new live profile for the band? Or was this their unacknowledged and poignant farewell? This engrossing film is a time capsule of London itself – the faces not so very different from those you would see in the 40s or 50s. (How quaint to hear about Tucson, Arizona, and California in cloudy Britain – which doesn’t here look particularly transformed by the 60s flower power revolution.) And for those of us in the post-Beatles age there is something very moving in the idea of those crowds in January 1969, casually taking for granted living in a world where all four Beatles are still alive, still together and still making music.

2/18/2022,"New York City mayor Eric Adams held a summit with a group of drill rappers on Tuesday night and clarified he doesn’t actually want to ban their music, days after he appeared to blame the music scene for the recent shooting deaths of two young New York rappers and suggested drill videos be pulled from the internet. He now says he wants to work with the artists to address gun violence, amid a period of soul-searching in one of music’s most controversial communities. Drill, named after the Chicago slang word for “kill”, was created in the early 2010s by rappers from some of Chicago’s most neglected neighborhoods, and features lurid stories of gang life – often laced with explicit threats against their rivals – over energetic, ominous instrumentals. The genre is known for its culture of “authenticity”, sometimes taken to an extreme: performers have been known to carry out the violent acts named in their lyrics, sometimes even while streaming on social media. These associations haven’t kept drill’s distinctive style from going mainstream, influencing acts such as Cardi B, Drake, and Travis Scott, and spawning spin-off locales around the world, including in London and Paris.  Brooklyn drill rapper Maino, who helped organize the meeting, posted a short clip of the event on Instagram, showing the rappers gathered around Adams. “I just wanted to create a conversation with the mayor … so he could get a real perspective and a real understanding of what drill rap is and so that we can have some real dialogue and really start to make things happen,” said the rapper in the video. At a press conference on Wednesday, the mayor denied ever calling for a ban on drill music, but said he was concerned about “violent people who are using drill rapping to post who they killed, and then antagonize the people who they are going to kill”. The mayor added that he and those at the meeting “will be rolling out something in the next days to deal with this issue”. Brooklyn is home to a significant drill movement, which combines musical influences from Chicago and London’s drill scenes, and became part of the unofficial soundtrack for local Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. But, as with these other urban epicenters, Brooklyn drill has also been marked by bloodshed. The scene reeled when one of its biggest stars, Pop Smoke, was shot and killed during a home invasion in 2020. But this year has already seen three brutal attacks. On 27 January, 22-year-old Brooklyn drill rapper Nas Blixky, real name Nasir Fisher, was shot in the head and left in critical condition. Three days later, on 2 February, an up-and-coming rapper named Tdott Woo, born Tahjay Dobson, was shot and killed outside his home in south-east Brooklyn just hours after signing a record contract. He was also 22. And days after that, an 18-year-old rapper Chii Wvtzz, AKA Jayquan McKenley, was shot dead outside of a recording studio in central Brooklyn. Bleezy DOD, a 27-year-old rapper from Brownsville, a low-income area in Brooklyn, said the shootings have been deeply painful for the community. “People was becoming stars. We dream of taking care of our families, and getting out of here, and it was taken away from them, and that ain’t right,” he said. Bleezy attended the mayoral meeting, which he described as lively and productive. There, he and other drill artists explained to the mayor that their music isn’t inherently violent. “We tried to tell him the genre is all about the beat,” he said. “It has a grime to it, a different type of sound; it gives you a different type of energy. There’s no such thing as drill lyrics.” Two others at Adams’ meeting were Rashid Littlejohn and Jelani Wray, respectively the founder and coordinator of Guns For Grants, a nonprofit that offers college grants to attend Brooklyn’s St Francis College to teens who surrender firearms. The mayor seemed “excited” about the idea, said Littlejohn, who hopes that the initiative could become a model for future city legislation. We got a chance to have a conversation with the mayor @FivioForeign @mainohustlehard #drillrap pic.twitter.com/h6YdIBNrzd Littlejohn, the former director of a Brooklyn after-school program, said he decided to start the program after a group of teens in his program were arrested for weapons possession while filming a drill music video, and feels “conflicted” about the drill scene. “I’m all for creativity, expressing where you come from, expressing your story and what goes on in your neighborhood,” he said. “But I do think that over the last ten years, drill rap has kind of taken a turn to be what we in the culture call ‘too authentic’, you know, where it’s not just music, when we’re talking about real names, real lives, real people who are being affected by not just the music, but what’s happening outside and in the streets.” Jabari Evans, an academic and rapper originally from Chicago, now an assistant professor of race and media at the University of South Carolina, came to understand the roots of drill music while working with youths on Chicago’s South Side. “Many of these youths have been sort of shut out of systems that should be there to help there become better individuals, but instead we have these individuals left to their own devices,” he said. In Chicago throughout the 2010s, the violence coupled with the visibility of drill artists “created a level of panic in the city for local politicians”, said Evans. The city under Rahm Emanuel’s mayorship tried to stamp out drill music, strong-arming venues into dropping drill performances and even setting up a police division to surveil drill artists – efforts that Eric Adams should regard with caution, he said. In Bleezy’s view, the music isn’t the cause of violence, but in many cases an escape from it. “We’re all in poverty, so nobody has opportunities. The pandemic hit, everybody feels left out. In these projects, these houses of people are all bunched up to four corners. Everything’s segregated off. We already feel like we have no outlets and no way out, so our only hope is the music.”",Arts/Music,Eric Adams meets with the drill rappers whose music he said he wanted to ban,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/18/eric-adams-drill-rap-music-gun-violence

2/18/2022,"Clean energy companies have asked the federal government “not to get in the way” of the private sector by investing in another publicly owned gas-fired power station to replace Australia’s largest coal-fired plant. Angus Taylor, the energy and emissions reduction minister, said on Friday the government had shown it would “look at all options” to ensure there was enough “dispatchable” capacity in the electricity market after the Eraring coal plant, on the shore of Lake Macquarie in New South Wales, closes from 2025.  Origin announced on Thursday it would bring forward the 2880-megawatt plant’s closure from 2032 due to an influx of solar and wind energy making traditional coal plants economically unviable. It had been negotiating with the New South Wales state government for months ahead of the announcement, but Taylor was blindsided, having only been told on Wednesday night. The Nature Conservation Council of NSW estimated Eraring’s early exit could reduce the plant’s lifetime greenhouse gas emissions by up to 87m tonnes, and described it as a “ray of hope for leaving a safe climate for our children”. Taylor said the government would prefer the private sector to build the needed new capacity – likely to be batteries, pumped hydro and gas plants – but left open the possibility it would step in if it was not satisfied. The Morrison government is already spending $600m on a new gas plant at Kurri Kurri in NSW’s Hunter Valley to coincide with the closure of the Liddell coal plant next year. Some analysts believe the gas plant, to be owned and operated by the commonwealth-owned Snowy Hydro Ltd, is not necessary to ensure a reliable electricity supply and have questioned its commercial viability. Kane Thornton, the chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, said Origin’s announcement would prompt companies to immediately reassess electricity investments that did not previously stack up. He said there was a “massive pipeline” of potential renewable energy and battery projects across Australia, but companies felt uncertainty over whether the federal government would intervene in the market and change their viability. “There’s still that uncertainty hanging over the marketplace. It just undermines confidence,” he said. “There is no doubt we can build enough capacity [to replace Eraring]. We just need the government not to get in the way and disrupt the market.” Thornton said the 660MW gas generator being built at Kurri Kurri was “an excellent example where the government had confused the market”. He said in an ideal world the federal government would introduce a national climate and energy policy to guide cleaner investment. He cited the example of the NSW electricity infrastructure roadmap, which passed parliament with multiparty support and is intended to underwrite the construction of 12GW of renewable energy and 2GW of storage. The closure of Eraring, which was built in the early 1980s, was “exactly what is meant to happen”, Thornton said. “We need the coal to come out to create space for more generation to come in. That’s the market behaving as it is intended to.” The Australian Electricity Market Operator said on Thursday that planned additional capacity, including a new battery meant to remove network constraints around Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong, and accelerated support for transmission links from the NSW government, meant the state would have access to enough electricity generation when Eraring closed. But Taylor said Eraring’s closure could lead to a repeat of a spike in wholesale electricity prices after the Hazelwood coal plant in Victoria shut in 2017. “A gap of this scale, if not addressed, will drive up energy prices,” he said. “Our preference is always for the private sector to make those investments. That’s why we’re encouraging, through national cabinet, a capacity mechanism – again imposed by some. But this is crucial to make sure that we have enough capacity coming into the market. We’ll work with all players to make sure we’ve got that.” In a capacity market, power generators are paid when they can guarantee they can dispatch electricity at specific times. Some in the renewable energy industry believe the payments will artificially prolong the life of coal generators. The national Energy Security Board is working on a design of a capacity market to be presented to federal and state ministers next year. In addition to Kurri Kurri, Taylor said the government was building a multi-billion dollar Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project, supporting the construction of new transmission links and had dedicated more than $50m to help the development of two privately owned gas developments. But a promised energy plant underwriting program remains in flux, with no contracts signed nearly three years after a shortlist of contenders was announced. The Eraring announcement was the latest in a series of early coal plant closures prompted by the rise of cheaper renewable energy, which now provides more than 30% of grid generation and is forecast to reach at least 69% by 2030. AGL announced last week it would bring forward the closure of the Bayswater generator in NSW from 2035 to no later than 2033, and its brown coal-fired Loy Yang A plant in Victoria from 2048 to no later than 2045. EnergyAustralia’s Yallourn power plant, also in the Latrobe Valley, last year said it would shut in 2028 rather than 2032, while Alinta said its Loy Yang B could stop generating 15 years earlier than scheduled. Aemo underlined the scale of the transformation under way when it released a draft plan for the grid’s future in December. It suggested the country’s coal-fired power plants were likely to shut almost three times as fast as set out in official schedules, and said an optimal future grid would require a ninefold increase in large-scale wind and solar and a trebling of the “firm” capacity that could be dispatched whenever required. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Australian Energy Council, representing electricity generators, said the earlier closures were significant but not unexpected. “Announcements of closures provide time to adjust and are likely to act as a spur to new investment to meet gaps identified in the market and to meet reliability needs,” the council’s chief executive, Sarah McNamara, said. “We are already seeing new battery proposals, along with pumped hydro and gas peaking plant.” The Greens said if they held the balance of power after the upcoming election they would call for the publicly owned Snowy Hydro corporation to be expanded and repurposed to build more than 25GW of wind, solar and energy storage over the next decade. The party’s leader, Adam Bandt, said under the plan Snowy Hydro would be renamed Clean Energy Australia and given $40bn equity to invest in new generation needed to replace coal. A not-for-profit retail arm, called Power Australia, would sell electricity on a cost-price basis to keep down household and business power bills. “With a massive government-led build of renewables, we can tackle the climate crisis while growing jobs,” Bandt said.",News/Environment,Clean energy companies plea for government ‘not to get in the way’ of renewable shift,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/18/clean-energy-companies-plea-for-government-not-to-get-in-the-way-of-renewable-shift
2/18/2022,"A Swedish gold medallist has said it was “extremely irresponsible” to hold the Winter Olympics in China because of the government’s human rights record. Nils van der Poel, a 25-year-old speedskater, made the comments after returning home from the Beijing event, where officials have been at pains to keep politics and protest out despite diplomatic boycotts.  Van der Poel told Sportbladet he had “a very nice experience behind the scenes”, but that the decision to give Beijing the Games was “terrible”. “The Olympic Village was very nice, the Chinese people I met were absolutely amazing,” he said. “The Olympics is a lot, it’s a fantastic sporting event where you unite the world and nations meet. But so did Hitler before invading Poland, and so did Russia before invading Ukraine. “I think it is extremely irresponsible to give it to a country that violates human rights as blatantly as the Chinese regime is doing.” Governments including the US have accused China’s government of conducting a genocide in Xinjiang, through its long campaign of forced assimilation against ethnic minorities, including Muslim Uyghurs. An estimated 1 million people have been detained in mass detention and re-education centres, and the general population has been subjected to acts of religious and cultural suppression, alleged forced labour, and enforced birth control. Several human rights and legal groups have said the actions amount to crimes against humanity. Beijing denies all accusations of human rights abuses, and says its policies are part of anti-terrorism efforts and poverty alleviation programmes. Rights groups had called for widespread boycotts of the Winter Olympics by governments and sponsors. Several nations including the US, UK and Australia staged a diplomatic boycott of the event, while there has been significant focus on athletes’ ability to protest. Human rights advocates had warned athletes about conducting any activism, including making statements, while in Beijing for the Games. The US Nordic skier and former Olympian Noah Hoffman said athletes had a powerful platform, but advised them to stay silent in Beijing. He said: “They can speak out when they get back.” Acts of protest at the Games are generally against the rules set by the International Olympic Committee, which also warned athletes not to protest at the Tokyo summer Games, or face potential punishment. However, there are mounting concerns over the increasing intolerance of protest, dissent or criticism in or against China. Prior to it starting, a Beijing official warned any athlete behaviour that is against the Olympic spirit or Chinese rules or laws would be subject to “certain punishment”. China’s government and Olympic officials have insisted the Games should be free from politics, but when asked at a press conference on Tuesday about human rights issues, committee spokesperson Yan Jiarong dismissed human rights violations among the Uyghur Muslim population as “lies” and insisted Taiwan was part of China.
