2/25/2022,"Ukrainian soldiers who died defending an island in the Black Sea from an air and sea bombardment reportedly told an officer on board a Russian navy warship to “go fuck yourself” when asked to surrender. There were 13 border guards stationed on Snake Island, a roughly 16 hectare (40 acre) rocky island owned by Ukraine that sits about 186 miles (300km) west of Crimea, when Russian troops bombed the island on Thursday. All 13 soldiers died after refusing to surrender, Ukrainian officials announced. In his address after the first day of the invasion of his country, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced he would posthumously award all of the soldiers the Hero of Ukraine award. “All border guards died heroically but did not give up,” Zelenskiy said. Audio has emerged that is purported to have captured an exchange between Ukrainian border guards on Snake Island and an approaching Russian navy vessel, in which a Russian officer told the Ukrainian forces on the island to “lay down your weapons”. “This is a military warship. This is a Russian military warship. I suggest you lay down your weapons and surrender to avoid bloodshed and needless casualties. Otherwise, you will be bombed,” the Russian office was recorded as saying on a naval radio channel. After a short period of silence in the recording, a Ukrainian officer reportedly responded: “Russian warship, go fuck yourself.” The audio has been published by multiple media outlets including the Ukrainian online newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda, and was shared on social media by Anton Gerashenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry.

2/25/2022,"This piece first appeared in Down to Earth, the Guardian’s climate crisis newsletter. Sign up here to read more exclusive pieces like this and for a digest of the week’s biggest environment stories every Thursday How do you solve a problem like the global fashion industry? From the declining lifespan of clothes to the lightning metabolism of fashion consumerism and the increased reliance on petroleum-based synthetic fibres, this is one industry desperate for an ecological plan.London fashion week – which ended this week – showed there still isn’t one. Coverage was dominated by the launch of a new collection from one of the fastest models of production and e-retail, Pretty Little Thing, owned by the Boohoo group. It didn’t seem to matter that this show was not officially part of fashion week – it had all the ingredients of a smash hit, including a social media superstar turned creative director, Molly-Mae Hague. And, in something of a plot twist, alongside the brand’s runway show came the announcement that it will launch a pre-owned resale marketplace later this year “in a bid to encourage its shoppers to embrace sustainability”.Of course reselling, reusing and extending the lifespan of garments is critical in the fight to bring some sanity into the fashion cycle. But to push out more fast fashion and then recirculate it later seems like the fashion equivalent of carbon capture storage. It may help soothe investors, but it is unlikely to decarbonise fashion.Room for rentMeanwhile, around the same time as PLT’s announcement a genuinely important fashion industry innovator – rental platform Onloan – announced that it was pressing pause, leaving a gap in the sustainable fashion ecosystem.Fashion rental platforms all have slightly different business models. Byrotation is a peer to peer lending app, charging a borrower per loan and taking a percentage from lender and renter. There’s MyWardrobe – from former Whistles CEO Jane Shepherdson, who has said she wants renting clothes to be as commonplace as renting a car; HURR, who have teamed up with Selfridges and Hirestreet, which aims to take things mainstream, providing rental for M&S.Onloan, meanwhile, offered a subscription model. Users could rent two or four pieces a month for £69 or £99. Unusually, the company bought and held stock. For co-founder Tamsin Chislett, who has a background running a fairtrade cotton project in Uganda, this is key to re-engineering the industry. “The fashion supply chain is riven with underpayment. For us it was important to pay for actual, finished garments to allow the manufacturing part of the supply chain to work,” she says.Onloan was prepared to invest in buying wholesale, offering a royalty fee every time the piece was rented and winning the trust and partnership of prestigious yet traditional designers, such as Joseph. The theory is that getting access to these brands at a fraction of the cost is part of the alchemy that can turn consumers to renters and take the heat (and carbon) out of the system.‘Risky’ businessNot everyone is convinced, though. In particular, a report published in May 2021 by respected Finnish academics put the boot in, concluding that renting clothes was less green than other options, including throwing them away. It got a lot of coverage, including in the Guardian. Not a good day for rental.But there were flaws in that study, beginning with the fact that researchers assessed the impact of renting a pair of jeans, which are rarely borrowed from such platforms. Moreover, assumptions made on logistics and garment care (the study factors in high use of dry cleaning) were not representative of the way the business works either, with many companies using new, low-impact technology.Fashion rental entrepreneurs believe they are getting to the point when they’ll soon have the data to prove that renting is the more sustainable option. But blunt analysis also fails to recognise the really big win that platforms like Onloan have achieved. They have changed the way people think about pre-worn clothes. The stigma is disappearing (something brands like PLT are no doubt fully aware of and keen to capitalise on).But, in the end, it wasn’t an unfavourable study or even the global pandemic that did for Onloan. It was a quirk of HMRC’s tax breaks for investors in ‘risky’ startups. In effect, these exclude models that hold stock, deterring investors from Onloan’s models. (As Chislett puts it, “you want to disrupt the fashion system to make it sustainable, not to fit in with HMRC’s plans to have investors pay less tax”). And so we must say goodbye to Onloan: we shall miss you from the sustainable fashion ecosystem, but we should not forget you.",News/Environment,Can renting our clothes reduce fast fashion’s climate crimes? ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/25/rent-clothes-fashion-sustainable-climate
2/25/2022,"On Monday the US supreme court will hear arguments in a group of cases that could have an immediate impact on the American government’s ability to respond to the climate emergency. The consequences could be even more substantial, however, reaching deep into the Biden administration’s authority to govern. The court will be considering the 2015 Clean Power Plan, a signature Obama program requiring states to lower greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. It was touted as critical to the achievement of the landmark Paris climate agreement, but its existence was short-lived: a coalition of states and energy groups sued to stop it, the supreme court blocked it and Donald Trump, self-professed lover of coal, repealed it when he took office. The Biden administration said it would not reinstate the Clean Power Plan, even after a federal court invalidated Trump’s repeal, because the goals of the plan had already been met through market forces, and because it was considering a new rule to replace it. So it came as a surprise when the supreme court announced it would review the lower court’s decision. Why is the court hearing a challenge to a plan that has never really been in effect, and never will be? Richard Lazarus, a professor of environmental law at Harvard University, thinks the court may be interested in a preemptive strike against ambitious environmental regulation. “This is a shot across the bow,” he says. “We’re going to tell you what you can’t do in case you’re even thinking about it.” But some court observers believe the case, West Virginia v EPA, may be an opportunity for the court’s conservative supermajority to take an even bigger hammer to the government’s regulatory power, helping to see through a Trump administration objective: the “deconstruction of the administrative state”. A muscular decision could help upend the power of the government to regulate a range of issues, from air quality to workplace protections to drug safety, and mean an effective supreme court veto over Joe Biden’s agenda. There are a number of ways the justices could rule in the EPA case. They could restrict the EPA’s powers under the Clean Air Act, the legal foundation for the Obama plan. They could more broadly target its power to address environmental concerns. They could also dismiss the case outright since the Clean Power Plan doesn’t actually exist. Or they could rule in a manner with implications beyond the EPA, as a who’s who of rightwing groups, many linked by funding from billionaire Charles Koch, have urged them to do in briefs filed in the case. By some counts, at least five justices have expressed interest in reviving a legal doctrine dormant since the 1930s, until recently considered fringe, which views much of the authority of the executive branch as illegitimate. Under an expansive version of that view, “most of government is unconstitutional”, Justice Elena Kagan has warned. The case “could be extraordinarily important, it could be moderately important, or it could be a case the court just dismisses on a belated realization that there’s no live controversy at all,” says Kate Shaw, professor at the Cardozo School of Law and co-host of the Strict Scrutiny podcast, which covers the supreme court. “The fact that the court took the case at all is concerning to me and suggests the court may want to use this case as a vehicle to really change the law,” she says. Some believe the case could undo the US government as we know it. In the 1930s, Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal created dozens of government programs and agencies to improve the US economy and create a social safety net. But the supreme court, in those years famously pro-business and prone to strike down social welfare legislation, thwarted him at every turn. In two decisions, it invoked a principle of “nondelegation” – a doctrine that says the constitution forbids Congress from transferring power to federal agencies to make rules. In 1937, faced with FDR’s threats to expand the court in order to push his legislation through, the court did an about-face and began upholding New Deal laws. The nondelegation doctrine faded into obscurity and the administrative state flourished. Ever since, the delegation of authority from Congress to agencies has been core to the functioning of government. Congress passes broad legislation enshrining certain principles and instructs agencies to fill in and update the details. The Clean Air Act, for example, instructs the EPA to regulate harmful emissions, but leaves it up to the agency to determine how to do so. The Occupational Safety and Health Act gives the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) the authority – recently restricted by the court – to issue standards regulating workplace safety. Particularly central in an age of congressional gridlock, this model of government allows experts in federal agencies to issue rules without Congress needing to regularly pass detailed laws. “Whether we’re talking about energy regulation, environmental regulation, workplace health and safety regulation, labor regulation – in each of those areas, Congress has passed broad statutes and given agencies a lot of discretion to implement those statutory directives,” says Shaw. “Depending on what the court says if it does reach the merits in this case, that could throw into question the permissibility of all of those delegations, which are in many ways the foundation of modern governance.” In the last two decades, and with particular fervor since the Obama presidency, the nondelegation doctrine has gained traction among originalists – jurists who claim to adhere to a meaning of the constitution fixed at the time of its drafting – who insist America’s founders were opposed to Congress delegating regulatory power to agencies. (Scholars respond that the doctrine has no basis in history or in the constitution). “Congress cannot duck its responsibility for making hard choices requiring compromise … by passing the buck to unelected, politically unaccountable administrative agents. The Constitution flatly prohibits Congress from delegating any of its legislative power to other entities,” according to a brief filed by the Koch-backed political advocacy group Americans for Prosperity. “As Justice Thomas has observed: ‘The end result may be trains that run on time (although I doubt it), but the cost is to our Constitution and the individual liberty it protects,’” the brief continues. Americans for Prosperity campaigned aggressively for the confirmation of Trump’s three supreme court nominees. Conservatives on the supreme court have expressed varying degrees of sympathy for this view, most recently when they blocked the Biden administration’s vaccine-or-testing mandate for large employers. In that case, three justices – Neil Gorsuch, Thomas and Samuel Alito – signed a concurring opinion, invoking both the nondelegation doctrine and the major questions doctrine, a related theory that says matters of major economic or political importance must be mandated by Congress. In a different case, Chief Justice John Roberts joined a dissent asserting the doctrine. Add to that signals from Brett Kavanaugh, and there are five justices who have voiced at least some support for using this arcane theory to undo the post-New Deal arrangement undergirding American government. Lazarus, the environmental law professor, has some sympathy for a principled view that major agency action should have backing from Congress. “The problem is, what do you do with that if you know Congress isn’t going to pass anything? We have a climate problem that if we don’t address [it] in the near term, it’s just an irreversible disaster at some point,” he says. “One is hard pressed to contend that the constitution requires such a catastrophic result.”",News/Law,How a court case over pollution could be used to unravel federal regulatory power,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/feb/25/supreme-court-west-virgina-epa-nondelegation-doctrine
2/25/2022,"In September, Ford stunned Michigan when it announced plans to build two massive electric vehicle (EV) plants in the nation’s southeast instead of its midwestern back yard. Fearing the future of the automotive industry was leaving Detroit, the state’s political class swung into action. Four months later, lawmakers responded by handing a staggering new subsidy deal to GM that they claimed would fortify the Motor City’s standing as the world’s auto capitol during industry electrification: In exchange for $1bn in tax incentives, the Detroit-based automaker promised $7bn in investment for new battery and EV plants that could create 4,000 new jobs. “This news is great for us and for Michigan, the epicenter of where we’re developing EVs,” GM president Mark Reuss said during the announcement. But what’s good for GM may make less sense for state taxpayers, a Guardian analysis of the deal finds. Once again large corporate subsidies – paid for by taxpayers – look set to benefit the corporations while leaving taxpayers out of pocket. Michigan has effectively agreed to compensate GM more than $310,000 for each job created, but during the next 20 years, the positions are unlikely to generate more than $100,000 in tax revenue in the very best case scenarios. Collectively, the plants’ jobs will probably return less than $300m of the state’s $1b investment when contributions to state income, sales, property and other taxes are factored in. The state also claimed the direct and indirect jobs created by the project will generate $29bn in new income over 20 years, or the equivalent of 29,000 jobs paying $50,000 annually. Economists from across the ideological spectrum who reviewed the analysis said that level of job creation is highly unlikely and pointed to a US Commerce Department report that labels such claims “suspicious”. Moreover, a state memo shows GM agreed to create only 3,200 positions – 800 fewer than it publicly promised, and the deal also allows it to close the plants within several years but keep most of the money. The package is “a really bad deal for Michigan taxpayers”, said Greg LeRoy, executive director of corporate subsidy watchdog Good Jobs First. Michigan isn’t alone: The deal is among a new wave of colossal corporate subsidy packages that lawmakers across the country are cooking up to lure EV manufacturing and more giveaways are in the works. And like other huge corporate sweeteners – notably the $4.8bn used to lure Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn to Wisconsin – LeRoy warns these “trophy deal” announcements may help political campaigns, but are also reckless deals that threaten to blow holes in states’ budgets in the coming decades. As the combustion engine is phased out, tax revenue from its production and use will drop off, and states will need EV revenue to replace it. EV manufacturing requires fewer direct and indirect jobs and adding generous subsidy deals further limits its financial returns. Already, Michigan has handed out more subsidy deals, worth at least $50m, than any other state, and it has struggled with budget shortfalls stemming from billions it owes on combustion engine tax incentives that have yielded questionable job and revenue returns. “You would think after all that history Michigan would be gun shy to do something like this that could bite them,” LeRoy said. GM and the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, a quasi-public agency that negotiates the state’s subsidy deals, didn’t respond to specific questions about the package and keeps its math secret. But the MEDC wrote in an email that it’s up to taxpayers to “de-risk” large projects for corporations, and the subsidies are essential for landing auto investment. “We cannot take for granted that they will stay in Michigan if we aren’t keeping up with our competitors,” a spokesperson said. GM added, “It is always up to the government entities to determine if and when incentives are granted, but our experience has shown that incentives are an important part of supporting the business case.” Critics say history also shows automakers are proficient in igniting economic war among states, a strategy former Ford and Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca detailed in a 1990 interview: “Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, all over the world, we would pit Ohio versus Michigan. We would pit Canada versus the US.” GM is planning to spend $35bn on EV and autonomous production through 2025, and Michigan lawmakers say they are competing against the southeast. Though Ford pointed to the southeast’s cheaper electricity, geography, available land and geological advantages as motivating its decision, “Michigan lawmakers found themselves embarrassed by the loss and reacted swiftly,” said Michael LaFaive, fiscal policy director with the right-leaning Mackinac Center for Public Policy, which tracks corporate subsidies. “These funds have more to do with job announcements than they do real jobs,” LaFaive said. Between 2002 and 2006, Michigan taxpayers contributed incentives worth about $110m to fund expansions of GM’s Ypsilanti township and Warren transmission plants near Detroit. State documents show the company and MEDC projected hefty returns: about 20,000 new or retained jobs and $2bn in new state tax revenue by 2027. Within several years, GM had created new transmission line jobs – in Mexico. The automaker shuttered the Ypsilanti township plant in 2009 and shipped its few hundred remaining jobs to Ohio or overseas. Less than a decade later, GM pulled the plug on the Warren transmission plant. For decades, Michigan automakers and the MEDC have hyped similarly extravagant subsidy packages as job- and revenue-creation troves, but MEDC documents obtained by the Mackinac Center and analyzed by the Guardian reveal a pattern of anemic returns on taxpayer investment in GM. Perhaps most infamously, the company in 1981 took $460m in subsidies while convincing Michigan leaders to raze a Detroit neighborhood so it could build its Poletown plant, which leaders claimed would create 6,000 direct positions and 19,000 indirect jobs. Poletown briefly employed 5,300 workers in 1985, but that figure quickly declined, and it never came close to achieving its promised productivity. Similarly, Ford took billions in Michigan tax incentives over the last 20 years before announcing its southeast EV plans. Michiganders have spent decades “investing in [automakers’] factories and what have they given us in return?” asked state Democratic floor leader, Yousef Rabhi. “They’ve abandoned those factories, fired thousands of hard working Michiganders who they left out in the cold with no remorse and moved those jobs to China, to Mexico,” Rabhi said. “Frankly, they turned their back on our state.” The new generation of EV factory incentives are effectively the same as those used to attract combustion plant investment in past decades, one of which the state auditor general found created about only 21% of its promised jobs, while LaFaive noted a large body of scholarly and other independent analysis that “demonstrate repeatedly that these programs have zero to negative economic impact”. The MEDC disagreed, and said it is “grateful” for GM’s history of investment in the state while noting that the automaker employs nearly 50,000 people in Michigan. When GM’s manufacturing job creation numbers in the state failed to live up to the subsidy package hype, the MEDC in 2020 changed the math to include more white collar jobs created at the company’s corporate headquarters in downtown Detroit. Meanwhile, GM has recorded $70bn in profits since 2010 while taking $8bn in subsidies in recent decades – more than all but one company nationwide. The idea that it needed incentives to invest in Michigan “is absurd”, said Matt Gardner, a senior fellow at the progressive-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP). Businesses report that tax subsidies infrequently determine where they invest, and Gardner pointed to Amazon’s decision to build its second headquarters in New York City even after the city yanked a proposed subsidy package worth billions. “GM has the money: If they see the need to invest, then they’re going to do it with or without the incentives,” Gardner said. The value of local and state incentives for GM’s two new plants totals at least $1b and may generate 3,200 direct jobs – or about $312,000 for each direct job created. GM says the positions will pay an average of $56,000 and $46,000 annually. For those earners, the conservative Tax Foundation and ITEP estimated an effective Michigan tax rate of between 9.2% and 10%, based on state tax law and IRS returns. At that rate, the plants’ workers could contribute about $4,600 in taxes each year, and over 20 years, the time period the MEDC used in its analysis, they could collectively generate about $294m – well shy of the state’s $1b investment. However, several economists called the analysis “very generous” to GM and the MEDC because it assumes the plants’ employees will provide new tax revenue. In other words, it posits “that these people didn’t have any jobs previously, that they weren’t spending any money”, Gardner said. With unemployment low, GM is unlikely to hire many unemployed workers, so the jobs will probably generate much less than $294m in new tax revenue over 20 years, economists say. In January, the state also slashed electric rates for some large users, like automakers, which may shift the utility grid’s cost burden on to residential customers. However, the analysis doesn’t include construction jobs or increases in GM’s state corporate taxes. The company and MEDC didn’t respond to questions about state taxes, but it’s unlikely to push the needle much: GM’s 2021 SEC filings show it paid between $102m and $272m in all 50 states in recent years. Meanwhile, economists said they strongly doubted MEDC’s claim that the plants’ direct and indirect positions will generate 29,000 new jobs and $29b in new income over the next 20 years. Many indirect jobs are low-paying, and the program that industry and the MEDC uses to develop economic impact projections is easily and commonly manipulated. Forecasting 20 years of economic impacts is nearly impossible, LaFaive said, and the MEDC’s job projection “strains credulity”. “They can’t tell the future because they can’t tell the future,” he said.",News/Environment,‘A really bad deal’: Michigan awards GM $1bn in incentives for new electric cars,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/25/michigan-awards-1bn-tax-incentives-gm-ev-plants
2/25/2022,"My earliest reading memoryBefore I could read, I was seduced by Beatrix Potter’s The Tailor of Gloucester. Embroidered poppies and pansies, “Alack, I am worn to a ravelling”, and especially the explosion of colour when the mayor’s cherry coat is flung across a table. My favourite book growing upThe Dark Is Rising by Susan Cooper was set a few miles from where I grew up in the Chilterns, deep country then and no doubt now ravaged by HS2. It’s a time-slip story, in which ordinary 1980s domesticity continually gives way to other eras, and it nourished my obsession with how history lodges in physical places. The book that changed me as a teenagerMy cousin is 10 years and a day older than me, and she took my countercultural education very seriously. When I was 15 she sent me Walking Through Clear Water in a Pool Painted Black by Cookie Mueller. It was a doorway into a Technicolor world of experimental art and high-risk adventure, a model I followed a bit too assiduously in my 20s. The writer who changed my mindI did media studies A-level at sixth form college, and had one of those life-changing teachers, Jeremy Points. He lent me Roland Barthes. S/Z flipped my lid. It had never occurred to me that novels might contain so many hidden layers of meanings, or that prising them open could reveal secrets about the culture from which they’d emerged. The book that made me want to be a writerWilliam Burroughs was the first writer I encountered where narrative was totally superseded by something else: an autonomous zone built out of language and atmosphere. I didn’t know how it worked but it made me start to write, first just by copying his hypnotic, disarticulated sentences – “Dead leaves in the pissoir” – on to my teenage bedroom wall. The book I came back toI just read Paradise Lost for the first time, and aside from its world-building majesty, no one ever told me how funny it was, or how weird. Angelic sex, proto-smoothies, Adam’s disquisition on the importance of keeping paths clear … I chased it with Milton’s God by William Empson, which is witty, rigorous and eye-opening: a model of how good criticism should be. The book I could never read againI was wild for Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre as a child but I went back to it in the pandemic after rereading all of Austen, and I’m sorry, but Jane Eyre is a horrendous little hysteric. Lock her in the red room! I found the heightened emotional temperature unbearable. Give me Austen’s coolness, irony, ambiguity any day. The book I rereadVirginia Woolf’s diary. Fleet, multiple, shifting, inordinate. The book I discovered later in lifeLast summer I interviewed Neil Tennant and he recommended Hadrian the Seventh by Frederick Rolfe, a novel about an embittered, impoverished writer who becomes pope and has a very jolly time punishing his enemies and dressing up. It’s one of the most grandiloquent books ever written, and is hilarious as well as quite agonising for anyone with an ounce of overblown ego. It led me on to the The Quest for Corvo, a gripping biography of Rolfe, whose gift for grudges and taste for decadence was unparalleled outside the Roman empire. The book I am currently readingBloms Bulbs spring catalogue. My comfort readWhen times are tough I turn to Tom Ripley, especially the later novels of the Ripliad where he has an enormous house in France and there are lots of long digressions about his dahlias and dressing gowns, before he bumps off another stranger unlucky enough to cross his path. Tom’s queer but not queer, and the books throb with the terrible anxiety of being found out. They’re the greatest novels about the closet that have ever existed.

2/25/2022,"Randy Blythe, frontman of the US metal band Lamb of God, remembers the first time he performed live sober. It was 18 October 2010, and the band were opening for Metallica in Brisbane, Australia. “I was thrown into the lion’s den,” he says. “On stage in front of 14,000 people, weeping uncontrollably – thank God I had long hair so it covered my face. I got sober on tour, surrounded by free drugs and alcohol. I felt if I could do it out there, I’d be able to maintain it anywhere.” Substance abuse and addiction can affect anyone. But with its tendency towards hedonism, the music industry can be dangerous for those who struggle with alcohol and drugs. We have watched many stars succumb to addiction, not to mention those who work behind the scenes. My own alcohol problem started before I became a music journalist, but I took full advantage of the late nights and heavy-drinking culture that came with the territory before I finally stopped. Now, as Covid-19 has forced a pause, change is afoot to help those who need it. Music Support, a UK charity that specialises in mental health and addiction in the music industry, runs a regular training course on mental health first aid. Part of the course touches on substance abuse. During the pandemic, the Tour Production Group (TPG), an association of live music touring professionals, asked Music Support if they could develop a course devoted to this issue. The result was a four-hour addiction and recovery training workshop, designed to help people working in music to understand addiction and feel confident about helping others. Since the workshops began in 2021, Music Support has trained more than 100 people, and heightened interest has led to the number of sessions doubling, from monthly to fortnightly. “This is something the industry is now demanding,” says Matt Thomas, co-founder of Music Support and a music industry veteran who struggled with addiction himself. “If we want to continue to be this creative, wonderful industry, we’re going to have to start getting better at [supporting mental health], or we’ll lose more people.” “So much is misunderstood and not said about addiction in the music industry,” says Norman Beecher, the senior learning and development specialist at Music Support, who runs the workshop. “There’s almost this unwritten rule that drugs and alcohol are a necessity if you’re a musician or in the music industry. It’s a narrative that needs to change.” Part of that change means challenging cliches, such as the romanticised image of the intoxicated musician. “It’s the glorification of rock’n’roll,” says Aðalbjörn “Addi” Tryggvason, frontman of the Icelandic metal band Sólstafir, who got sober in 2013. “You think you’re supposed to drink a bottle of bourbon a night. I thought you couldn’t be confident, or into it, without being drunk or high on drugs.” “There’s this cultural mythos of the artist as an alcoholic, a drug addict,” says Blythe. “I was nervous at first [when sober] that I wouldn’t be able to write. In fact, it unlocked sort of a creative switch in my brain.” Mike Kerr, of Royal Blood, agrees: “I had an entrenched belief that being hungover or intoxicated was great for creativity.” But once sober, he wrote the rock duo’s third album, Typhoons, an expansion of the band’s sound that continued their streak of UK No 1 albums. “People could hear I was using my whole brain,” he says. The music industry is full of high-risk situations when it comes to substance abuse and addiction. For many, touring is the most challenging aspect of what they do. “I didn’t start drinking until I started playing music,” says country music singer Morgan Wade. “Touring is lonely: you go out and kind of cut yourself open for all these people. It’s loud and fun, then you go back to your bus, you’re hyped up and alone. That can be hard.” “It’s been six and a half years now, and I’m still not used to it,” says Nita Strauss, the guitarist in Alice Cooper’s band, of being sober on the road. “On my solo tours we have instituted a ‘no alcohol on the bus’ policy. I don’t mind if my band and crew drink. But if I open the fridge and it’s full of it, it’s very difficult.” While the artist has to deal with the highs and lows of attention, it’s important to remember those not in the spotlight. “There are a lot of people on crews, in management companies and record labels, who have died,” says Thomas. “It wouldn’t even be known that this is what they died from because there’s so much shame and stigma around it. It’s covered up.” Duff Battye runs a PR company, Duff Press, representing bands such as Def Leppard, Kiss and Slash. “I felt like I had to go away from the music industry when I got sober,” he says. “My perception was that partying was part of the job. I wasn’t sure people would understand.” “I recall going to an awards show and they came round with 10 glasses of champagne and one glass of juice,” says Beecher. “That needs to change. It needs to be 50:50. So people start thinking, OK, I have a choice here.” Beecher says he moulded the workshop to promote understanding that not everyone who drinks to excess is an addict. “We’re not saying people shouldn’t drink,” he says. “What we’re saying is, let’s have a balance and not glorify this.” “We’re not anti-alcohol, anti-hedonism, anti-anything,” adds Thomas. “What we are is pro-education – and choice.” The music industry was hit hard by the pandemic. But, for many, one silver lining of the global crisis has been connections made online. “The ability to jump into a meeting with people in five different parts of the planet is powerful,” says Christopher Tait, the keyboardist in Electric Six. Christopher runs his own organisation, Passenger, which supports sober musicians on tour in the US midwest. “I think people are connected in ways they never have been.” Another online support group started up during the pandemic is the Back Lounge, created by Suzi Green, a tour manager who has worked with artists such as PJ Harvey, Placebo and Katie Melua. Green is also part of the TPG and helped to get the addiction and recovery workshop going. “The back lounge on the tour bus is where all the interesting conversations happen,” Green says. “It’s mostly people who work in touring and events, from all over the world. Sometimes it can go deep and dark, but it always ends with people laughing; it’s meant to be uplifting. Addiction came up a lot, and the stigma of being in recovery.” As Thomas says, it’s also crucial to quash the stigma of addiction as a “moral failure” within the music industry. “The idea that someone who is in recovery is a liability is probably the biggest misconception. Someone in a healthy recovery will be the most reliable employee of the lot.” Opening up communication, challenging stigmas and making people aware that help is available all bode well for the future. Meanwhile, attitudes are shifting. “As a kid, I remember hearing about Aerosmith being sober and laughing – ‘What a bunch of losers!’” says Tryggvason. “Nobody is laughing about this today.” “I’m glad I got sober in 2010 and not 1990,” says Battye. “When I came into the industry it was like the wild west. I was told off for not going out enough; part of my job was get journalists drunk at lunchtime. Now I can’t remember the last time someone had a drink at a work lunch.” “I think there’s more awareness among young people today that it’s not cool to be a drunken mess,” says Blythe. “It’s rare that I see a really hard-partying younger band in our scene. They are the outliers, whereas before they were more the norm.” “I used to get applauded for downing a drink on stage and fooled myself into thinking that was part of what people came for,” says Kerr. “But ultimately, people come to watch us play and have a good time – and how I have a good time has changed. “It’s gone full circle: the reason I started playing is because I love it. Now I’m back to where I started – where people can come to watch me just lose myself in the music.”",Arts/Music,‘Hard-partying bands are the outliers now’: how rock’n’roll broke up with booze and drugs,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/25/hard-partying-bands-are-the-outliers-now-how-rocknroll-broke-up-with-booze-and-drugs
2/25/2022,"There is a particular experience that comes from living in close proximity to, but total separation from, people whose tastes may presage our tastes in future. In my neighbourhood in New York, a mile or so from the city’s downtown and Brooklyn, no one is striving to be on trend. People are, for the most part, striving to be on time, in a state of ball-park togetherness, with all their children accounted for. If I have time to look in a mirror, my thought isn’t: do I look cool? It’s, do I look normal? In keeping with the rest of the neighbourhood, it is thrillingly, absolvingly lame. These observations are a predictably late response to the conversation around A Vibe Shift Is Coming, an article – for the benefit of those even further from the epicentre than me – published in New York magazine’s the Cut 10 days ago, which has been roiling social media ever since. In it, the writer Allison P Davis reports from the bleeding edge (irredeemably middle-aged phrasing!) of the country’s trend forecasters, who predict an imminent change in cultural trends. Jeans may go low rise, the last of hipsterdom may die and the appetite for political division and posturing, with the totemic language – “cancel culture”, “virtue signalling” – that came with it, may wither. If the pandemic acts, structurally, a little like the first world war, and with a big caveat around Russia, then the 2020s may be about to usher in a new jazz age. We may, predicts the article, lose our heads and lighten up. As with all these things, it’s hard to look out of the window and pin this discussion to any concrete reality – although, even away from the trend hubs of downtown New York and LA, there are indicators of large-scale change. The Great Resignation, in which record numbers of largely 30- to 45-year-olds quit their jobs in the wake of the pandemic, is a vibe shift of sorts, as is disaffection with big tech. This last indicator is readable via lots of “does anyone still post on here?” exchanges between middle-aged people on Facebook. To view but not be part of a trend shift is the horror of the young and the consolation of the middle aged, where any discovery of potentially untapped energy reserves – things I used to worry about and don’t worry about now! – is pathetically welcome. What constitutes, per phrasing in the article, being “left behind” to one group falls into the category of blissful ignorance to the other. Fear of missing out edges into the nihilism-tinged joy of not caring. What’s odd about these kinds of trend pieces, of course, is the certainty that whatever your relationship with fashion, you can’t ever wholly opt out. Any rejection of a trend is as shaped by its dynamic as a full embrace. My claims to not caring are disingenuous, too. Those of us living in the lame, middle-aged neighbourhoods of major cities can benefit from trend-adjacency while still wearing high-waisted jeans from the Gap. In the 2010s, I sneered at hipsters as energetically as all the other thirtysomethings, but I did quite like their hipstery glow. I could be part of that, I thought, it’s right on my doorstep; I simply choose not to. Like a stopped clock, if you live for long enough you will inadvertently find your regular style right on trend, which is why normcore was so exciting for people who only ever go out in their running shoes. I’m hoping, with this in mind, for a future in which Gore-Tex outerwear finally has its moment; we celebrate big white sneakers, Jerry Seinfeld-style; and unbrushed hair, last-minute decision-making and a 9pm bedtime have their long overdue moment in the sun.

2/25/2022,"Douglas Costa. “I’ll bring the flash that LA expects,” the 31-year-old winger declares in a curiously dark and menacing video announcing his transfer to the Galaxy. Carnival has never looked so sinister. Unlike that studio, MLS stadiums should be lit when one of the world’s best dribblers graces the field. A serial winner with Shakhtar Donetsk, Bayern Munich and Juventus, Costa has 31 Brazil caps and ought to supply Javier Hernández with plenty of chances. TD Lorenzo Insigne. The Italy international could eclipse Sebastian Giovinco as the player to have reached the highest peak in MLS history. But what condition will Toronto FC’s season be in by the time he pitches up at BMO Field at the start of July? GR MLS as a legitimate haven for global talents. While a late-prime Lorenzo Insigne and Xherdan Shaqiri will bring extra interest to the league, it’s the talents at the beginning of their careers that should garner the most intrigue. The year-old U22 Initiative has already gone a long way to loosening the stranglehold of MLS cap rules and it will continue to pay dividends for years to come. The Argentinian duo of Thiago Almada (Atlanta) and Alan Velasco (FC Dallas) should set the standard for young foreign stars in the league. TR The offseason featured big name veteran signings Insigne and Costa. But the trend of young South American players like Thiago Almada seeking development in MLS – and homegrown talents stepping on the scene – will bolster the league in the longer term. MS Gabriel Slonina, Chicago Fire. The tradition of American goalkeepers heading to Europe will continue when Matt Turner joins Arsenal this summer, and the Illinois-born Slonina may not be too far behind. The 6ft 4in 17-year-old became the youngest-ever starting MLS goalkeeper last August. A lot more sensible than his “Gaga” nickname implies, he made 11 starts last season for the Fire and was called into the US senior squad. TD Cade Cowell, San Jose Earthquakes. The 18-year-old featured in 33 games for the Quakes in 2021, registering five goals and five assists in the process. The retirement of Chris Wondolowski will place more responsibility on Cowell, who is already a full USA international, to produce big numbers in the final third. 2022 could be the year the teenager becomes a serious attacking force for San Jose. GR Gabriel Slonina, Chicago Fire. Enjoy him while you can because he’ll be off to Europe sooner than you think. The US goalkeeping assembly line keeps producing gems and there’s an argument that Slonina may be the most talented yet. TR European clubs have made overtures for Valentin Castellanos, expressed interest in Jesus Ferreira, and confirmed they’re monitoring Paxten Aaronson. But for reasons of timing, contract or price tag, all remain in MLS. 2022 could be their year but I predict the next player to draw interest from across the Atlantic will be Philadelphia’s Jack McGlynn. MS A radically-reshaped Toronto fail to gel. Under-fire head coach Bob Bradley declares he has unfinished business in Wales after his brief stint with Swansea and leaves for a gig managing ambitious American/Canadian-owned Wrexham. His son, veteran TFC midfielder Michael Bradley, replaces him as interim boss. TD The Ronny Deila strip-show will become a tradition for MLS Cup-winning managers in much the same way Super Bowl-winning coaches receive a Gatorade bath. Press-ups, as Deila performed in front of the New York City FC support at Providence Park, are optional. Who’s ready to see Brian Schmetzer or Bruce Arena stripped down to their underwear this October? GR Somehow FC Cincinnati won’t collect a record fourth consecutive wooden spoon. Since joining MLS in 2019 the rocky road to stability has been more of a treacherous cliff for FC Cincinnati. If you added up the club’s point totals from all three MLS seasons so far they would still finish far behind New England Revolution last year. This is the season they break the trend (this theory is based on nothing but hope, belief in the human spirit and undying faith in Brenner.) TR Bob Bradley will turn Toronto FC around. After a lackluster year with LAFC, Bradley is off to Canada to coach a team that finished 2021 13th in the East. They won’t finish front of the pack but I think we’ll see Bradley’s team in the playoffs this autumn. MS Josef Martínez, Atlanta United. Last year’s Golden Boot winner, Taty Castellanos, is the obvious candidate – but with intense interest from overseas it’s doubtful he’ll see out the season at NYC FC. So, two years after his torn ACL, how about a fully fit Martínez scoring like it’s 2018 again for a resurgent Atlanta United and winning his second MVP? TD Raul Ruidiaz, Seattle Sounders. Ruidiaz could be in line for the award on the back of a big season given the number of chances the Sounders will create for him. The Peruvian scored 17 goals in 26 games last season. It won’t be surprising if he betters that tally in 2022. GR Albert Rusnák, Seattle Sounders. Rusnák is at the peak of his powers and will thrive in a very deep and experienced Seattle Sounders side. Over the past five seasons, Rusnák totaled 41 goals and 39 assists in 140 appearances for Real Salt Lake and with the attacking talent on display at Seattle, his contributions should go even further. TR Hany Mukhtar, Nashville. Mukhtar will play a key role in Nashville’s transition to the Western Conference. The German international has scored 20 goals across 46 games in his two MLS seasons. My prediction? That count climbs higher as Mukhtar leads Nashville toward the top of the West in 2022. MS New England, NYC FC, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Columbus, Chicago, NY Red Bulls. TD Philadelphia, New England, NYC FC, Atlanta, Toronto, Montreal, Orlando. GR New England, Atlanta, Toronto, Philadelphia, NYC FC, Columbus, Orlando. TR NYC FC, Philadelphia, New England, Atlanta, Columbus, Orlando, Toronto. MS Seattle, Nashville, LAFC, Portland, Colorado, LA Galaxy, Kansas City. TD Seattle, Colorado, Nashville, Kansas City, Vancouver, LAFC, Minnesota. GR LAFC, Seattle, Nashville, Kansas City, Portland, Colorado, LA Galaxy TR Seattle, Nashville, Kansas City, LAFC, Minnesota, Portland, LA Galaxy. MS New England Revolution. Postseason drama – the defining bug/feature of MLS – was in full-effect last year as the best team (ever!) over 34 regular-season games fizzled in their only playoff match, losing on penalties to eventual winners NYC FC. A trio of veteran arrivals – Sebastian Lletget, Jozy Altidore and Omar Gonzalez – could help Bruce Arena’s side go all the way this time, with the 32-year-old Altidore surely motivated to upgrade his international status from “former” star to “current” in a World Cup year. TD Seattle Sounders. The 2016 and 2019 champions have assembled one of the most complete squads in MLS history. The off-season addition of Rusnák has bolstered an attack that already included Ruidiaz, Nicolas Lodeiro and Jordan Morris with the midfield double pivot of Joao Paulo and Cristian Roldan providing a solid base. From back to front, they have a good combination of youth, experience and different skill sets. The Sounders will take some beating in 2022. GR Nashville SC. There’s a certain solidity about Nashville that can pay dividends in the playoffs. Clean-sheet specialist Joe Willis is a daunting presence in goal and the experienced Walker Zimmerman keeps things very organized at the back. Sleeper MVP candidate Mukhtar is poised to take off in his third season with the club but their attack will have to carry a bit more of the burden overall. As long as CJ Sapong and Randall Leal are firing on all cylinders, this could be their year. TR Seattle Sounders. The stars are aligned for the Sounders this season. An already stacked roster was given more depth in the off-season, as the team snagged players like Albert Rusnák from Real Salt Lake. Morris and Lodeiro are now healthy. Nouhou is in top form following the Africa Cup of Nations with Cameroon. Add to this standout players like Joao Paulo and Ruidiaz and we’ve got a lethal Sounders team on our hands.

2/25/2022,"The hackStruggling to apply your eyeliner? Try using kirby hair grips, sticky tape and a YouTube tutorial. The promiseWinged eyeliner is hard enough to achieve on one eyelid, let alone getting it symmetrical on two. This YouTube trick uses hair grips or sticky tape to stencil on your liquid liner. The testI’ve worn liquid eyeliner since I was 14, but so rarely achieve that sharp, symmetrical flick I crave. I start with the kirby grip method, which involves coating the forked end of a grip (the flat side) with liquid eyeliner. Then I line the fork up with the corner of my eye and press. The result? A wonky, hollow arrow shape that looks dire. Next up, the sticky-tape approach. I take two 5cm-long pieces to create a V-shaped stencil on the corner of my eye. I fill in the gap using liner and connect the flick to the rest of my eyeliner. Finally, I remember a technique I saw backstage at fashion week. I draw along the outer tape edge to create a flick, finish the rest of the liner and, once it’s dry – otherwise it will smudge – peel off the tape. This might be the best my liner has ever looked. The verdictThe sticky-tape trick is fiddly but effective.

2/25/2022,"It’s the fingers that get to me. Bitten and weathered, the skin worn down in places, they are incredibly detailed and utterly convincing. I’m looking up close at an animatronic, or robot, of the German writer Thomas Melle. The show proper – a lecture delivered by this robot – has finished and the audience has been invited on stage to study our automated actor. It feels like viewing time at the zoo and I can’t shake the feeling that this robot is somehow going to wake up, reach out and grab me. The animatronic, created by Chiscreatures Filmeffects GmbH, is an enthralling production in itself. It looks and sounds like a slightly flattened but fascinating human being. His features seem smudged, his face animated yet oddly deflated. His eyes look trapped inside his skin and when he turns, with slow and deliberate movements, we spot – with a shock – wires dangling from the back of his head. The lecture doesn’t quite deliver. Written by Stefan Kaegi of the German theatre group Rimini Protokoll, in collaboration with Melle, it’s a dense and earnest monologue penned from the perspective of this thoughtful writer. Big reverberating questions are posed: how much control do we have over our lives? What sets us apart from robots? If we eliminate life’s uncertainty, what are we left with?They’re pertinent ideas but seem somehow beside the point. The show’s most meaningful moments are much less deliberate. As we file into the theatre, Melle’s animatronic sits in the shadows. Is he switched off, or is he waiting? Later, Melle’s monologue discusses his manic depression. The robot’s face stays exactly the same … doesn’t it? Then how does he suddenly look so sad?

2/25/2022,"Russian forces have attacked Ukraine on the orders of Vladimir Putin who announced a “special operation” at dawn on Thursday. World leaders have denounced the invasion and warned that it could ignite the largest war since 1945. Though many Russians may support their president’s actions in Ukraine, others are against the conflict. A new poll released by the independent Levada Centre showed only 45% of Russians were in favour of Putin’s recognition move that preceded the invasion. There were protests against the war in town and cities across Russia on Thursday night. A Guardian callout asking for Russian views about the situation with Ukraine received scores of submissions from people across the country, though the majority came from respondents living in Moscow. Many of those who contacted the Guardian did so to express their concern over the escalation. Among the submissions were younger Russians who had got in touch to say that they were opposed to their government’s actions in Ukraine, with many emphasising they had family, friends and partners in Ukraine. “Russian youth are devastated by the prospect of war between Russia and Ukraine,” Dmitry, a 21-year-old student in Moscow, said. “All of my friends and I, who live in Moscow and other Russian cities, are extremely scared. No one expected that the war would really break out.” I went to sleep about five o’clock [on Thursday morning after watching Putin’s address to the nation]. I spoke to my friend from western Ukraine, as he was discussing the possibility of leaving the country, and when I woke up at nine, I realised it [the attack on Ukraine] had happened.” Dmitry, who was one of more than 150 people who responded to the reader callout, said there was a “clear generational divide”. “I would say that almost all of my friends oppose Putin’s actions. There are numerous posts on social media,” he said. “I fear Putin is unstoppable. This time he’s not concerned about public opinion. There was an overall euphoria [in Russia] after the annexation of Crimea in 2014 but now literally nobody supports the war. People may support Luhansk and Donetsk regions as they’re Russian-speaking but nobody wanted us to invade Ukraine. For the younger generation, we’re worried about what’s going to happen with our future.” Several Russians who got in contact with the Guardian spoke about a lack of desire for conflict and a sense that the government was not representative of its people. Natalia, a 52-year-old teacher in St Petersburg, said: “I am totally devastated about the tragic events unfolding in Ukraine. I know that many people living in Russia experience a deep sense of guilt and shame for the actions and hostile rhetoric of the Russian leaders, many of us have never even voted for.” Natalia said that she views Putin’s military actions in Ukraine “as an extreme act of aggression and hostility towards an independent country” and believes harsher sanctions should have been imposed in 2014. The teacher said that while some Ukrainians “quite justly” blame Russians for not speaking out against their government, the crackdown on political protest has intensified in the last decade. Many Russians live with a “fear of imprisonment, which nowadays, has become a sad reality”, Natalia said, adding: “There’s little resemblance between Russia of 2022 and Russia of 2011 when hundreds of thousands of people took to streets to protest against the rigged elections. However, Russians are not silent – we are being silenced.” Some view the crisis in Ukraine as being fuelled by pressure from the west. Ilya from Sochi believes Putin’s actions are “following the feelings of insecurity” among Russians. “It seems to me that Russian society feels under siege by Nato and the US and feels it needs to defend itself,” he said. “Ukrainian nationalists … want to align Ukraine with the west, while disregarding shared history, cultural and familial ties between nations.” He feels the entire situation is unfair but hopes that a peaceful resolution can be found. Another concern raised was one of the Russian economy and the impact sanctions would have on the country’s citizens. “We’re economically dependent on other countries and apart from the financial hardship caused by the pandemic, we’re still feeling the consequences of the sanctions from 2014,” said Kristina from Kaliningrad. She said with the onset of a war prices will rise and it’s the “regular” citizens of Russia who will be affected, not the “oligarchs”. “Our economy is still developing and we are not recovering. These latest sanctions will just make it even worse for everyone,” she said. Kristina spoke about the psychological pressure many Russians are under amid the rapidly escalating crisis in Ukraine. “It’s impossible to overestimate the amount of stress ordinary Russian people are under right now. One of the most stressful things is the rest of the world thinking Russia is evil and that this was the people’s decision. It wasn’t and we are not equal to our leader.” “For a regular citizen it is hard to understand what is true and what is false, who is right and who is wrong,” she said. Kristina said that most people she knows are “harsh critics of Putin’s actions” and sympathise with Ukraine “where some of us have friends and families”, while others are confused by the situation. “What I know for sure is that no one wants any kind of war.” ",News/World news,‘I fear Putin is unstoppable’: Russians on the invasion of Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/russian-guardian-readers-on-ukraine-invasion
