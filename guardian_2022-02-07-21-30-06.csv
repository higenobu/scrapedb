2/7/2022,"‘We’ve made it. We’re still alive!” begins Mick Hucknall. He’s obviously talking about the pandemic – more sombrely dedicating the gig to “all those who didn’t make it”. However, he could be describing the 37 years in which he’s been through some 20-odd band members, womanising, alcoholism and a brief band split to emerge as a happily married 61-year-old who radiates warmth and contentment. Despite selling 50m albums, it’s years since Simply Red’s pop-soul was contractually obliged to blare from every wine bar and taxi in the country, although you’d never know it from the sea of middle-aged couples swaying along and marvelling at the Huck’s timelessly honeyed chops. After six years off the road, his famous hair hasn’t gone simply grey but the introductions are as rusty as the barnet. The Huck announces wrong songs (“Er, this isn’t For Your Babies”), shouts “Let’s go back to 1988! Er… 1985!” and introduces Gregory Isaacs’ lovers rock classic Night Nurse as “Sort yer cold out.” Such endearing off-piste moments are welcome in Simply Red’s otherwise succession of machine-polished smashers, in which the newest song dates from 2007.  Hucknall’s career wasn’t built on experiment, but Homer Banks’s 1966 northern soul stomper (Ain’t That) A Lot of Love is reworked as deep house. Visuals of the stricken planet remodel Come To My Aid into a climate change anthem and it’s hard not to admire how 1987’s The Right Thing cheekily sneaked the line “I’m getting harder now!” into the Top 20. The socialist singer’s yell of “It’ll get a lot worse!” before Money’s Too Tight (To Mention) seems to reference the cost of living crisis, but the crowd come for old hits and get them. Sole other original member Ian Kirkland blows up a trumpet storm on the slinky, underrated Thrill Me. Stars, Fairground and the rest start dancing in the aisles, before Harold Melvin’s If You Don’t Know Me By Now becomes the celebratory singsong of a band and audience enjoying growing old together.

2/7/2022,"Sifu owes an obvious and honest debt to classic Hong Kong cinema. But if you’re here for a kung fu power fantasy, a word of warning: you are in for a wait. While it eventually lives up to its inspirations, Sifu initially plays out less like a Jackie Chan film than the blooper reel that runs under the end credits, with our hero mistiming a kick and falling on his arse, greeting a coffee table with his chin, or somehow contriving a wedgie from a stepladder. Except that here, instead of a rueful Chan-style grin to camera, the screen fades to black and you die. Thankfully, death is not the end in Sifu. It is, paradoxically, the lifeblood of the game. Die, and you can resurrect – but you pay the price with age. A “death counter” rises with every failure, adding to how much older you become each time you get back up: first one year, then two, then more. The protagonist’s face wrinkles and hardens; their health bar shortens, but the wisdom of age makes their attacks deal more damage. Once you hit 70, your next fall will be your last.  This is an alien concept at first, in keeping with a game that often seems more interested in confusion than entertainment. Sifu is punishingly difficult, built around a morass of jarringly unconventional ideas that are minimally explained. The combat that forms the meat of the game is made of familiar parts – light and heavy attacks, a dodge, a pleasing suite of graceful bobs and weaves – but even veterans of hand-to-hand video game dust-ups will struggle to put them into practice. The game appears to favour neither attack nor defence. Your combos are ducked or parried, your guard broken by volleys of enemy blows, collapsing you to the floor. And when you do create a window of opportunity, it slams shut at lightning speed. The action spans five levels, running the gamut of kung fu classics – drug den, nightclub, tower block. They are long, drawn-out and exasperatingly difficult at first (though shortcuts, once discovered, shorten the route to the boss). When you die, you can try again at the last stage you had reached, your age and upgrades carried over. However, when you finally beat the first boss, the chances are you’ll be pretty old. (I was in my late 60s after a solid day’s punishment.) You will have maybe a couple of lives left – enough for a nose around the next level, but no more. And of course, if you’re that old when starting the second level, you have next to no chance of clearing all five. To give it a proper go you will have to abandon the new area, return to the previous one and run through it over and over until you make it through at a more acceptable age. Then you will work on getting to the next boss, and the cycle repeats. At some point you’ll need to go back to the beginning and optimise your run further. This, sadly, means saying goodbye to most of the upgrades you’ve unlocked. It is a strange, and rather deflating, sensation when your reward for finally surmounting a challenge is being told to go back and do it again, only better. Over time, I came to understand what the game expected from me: perfection, pretty much. You can claw back a little health from flashy take down kills, and reduce the death counter by killing strong enemies. You unlock new moves and small stat increases as you go. But the only way to truly succeed in Sifu is to submit to its demands and learn its language, committing attack patterns and parry timings to memory. The flow of each fight – where enemies come from, where weapons are placed, how to position yourself to make best use of the scenery – must be rehearsed until perfected. Then you practise, and practise some more, and hope for the run where everything goes to plan. When it finally does, it sings. You’ll stroll into areas you know inside out, seeing off the goons who once gave you so much trouble, with effortless grace and bone-crunching power. The boss you were stuck on for two days barely lands a single hit on you as you duck, dive and counter with immaculate ease. In these moments, the frustrations of the earlier game simply melt away. Until the next boss fight, anyway. The Chinese term “kung fu” roughly translates as “a skill acquired through hard work and practice”. Sifu might just be the purest expression of the concept that games have ever seen. The journey is brutal. It is not for the faint of heart, nor the short of patience. But those prepared to rise to the challenge will find that something spectacular comes after the pain. Is it worth the hardship? Ask me when the wounds have healed.

2/7/2022,"Deciding to pick the inexperienced and extreme Sarah Palin as his running mate – a choice many say facilitated the rise of Donald Trump, threatening US democracy itself – John McCain mimed rolling a pair of dice and said: “Fuck it. Let’s do it.”  The pithy vignette is revealed in a new book, Insurgency: How Republicans Lost Their Party and Got Everything They Ever Wanted, by Jeremy W Peters, a New York Times reporter. It was reported by Axios. McCain, a Republican senator from Arizona, enjoyed a reputation as a political maverick. He sometimes tried to deny it, for example in 2010 telling the reporter David Margolick: “I never considered myself a maverick. I consider myself a person who serves the people of Arizona to the best of his abilities.” But that earned mockery – Jon Stewart said it was “like Rudy Giuliani coming out and going, ‘Hey, I never mentioned 9/11! What are you talking about?’” – and the new story from Peters only adds to the impression McCain was happy to take political risks, sometimes to the detriment of himself and those around him. McCain died in 2018 but remains a figurehead of sorts for the few Republicans who defy Trump, whose dislike for the senator and Vietnam veteran is often demonstrated, sometimes in bizarre fashion. In 2008, McCain was the Republican nominee to succeed George W Bush. He faced Barack Obama, an inexperienced senator from Illinois but a political meteor. Peters reports that in August, with election day three months off, needing a boost, McCain spoke to advisers at his ranch in Arizona. He had narrowed his choice of running mate to three. There was Palin, governor of Alaska, a hard-right populist and political neophyte. There were two experienced moderates, Tim Pawlenty, then governor of Minnesota, and Mitt Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts. According to Peters, a long-time aide, Mark Salter, “cautioned [McCain] voters could see a Palin pick as discordant with the message of readiness and experience that the campaign had been focusing on as a contrast with Obama, a 47-year-old first-term senator.” Salter told McCain: “There’s worse things, John, than losing an election. You could lose your reputation.” Another aide, Steve Schmidt – now a prominent anti-Trump campaigner – has widely been blamed for the Palin pick. Peters reports that Schmidt “told McCain he should consider whether it would be worth it if he chose Palin and lost, but also knew in the end that he’d lost because he did something bold. “What you’ve got to decide,” Schmidt reportedly said, reaching for a football metaphor, “is would you rather lose by seven going for it?” Peters writes: “McCain turned to his wife, Cindy. ‘John, it’s a gamble,’ she said. “This made McCain’s face light up. ‘Well, I wish you hadn’t said that,’ he said. McCain, an avid craps player, balled up his fist and blew on it, then shook it like he was about to roll a pair of dice. “‘Fuck it,’ he said. ‘Let’s do it.’” With Palin at his side, McCain lost convincingly. Palin nonetheless became a national figure, mocked on the left, loved on the right, sharing airtime with the Tea Party, a hard-right anti-tax movement fed by big donors and, detractors said, racist resentment of the first Black president. Romney was the Republican nominee in 2012, losing to Obama. Trump followed in 2016, blowing the party establishment out of the water with a campaign of anger, controversy and hatred then beating Hillary Clinton in the general election. In the first years of Trump’s tumultuous presidency, McCain was a thorn in his side, famously voting down an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act with a dramatic thumbs down. He died in August 2018, of brain cancer. Three years later, Romney is a senator from Utah, the only member of his party to vote to convict Trump in both his impeachments, for seeking political dirt from Ukraine and for inciting the Capitol attack. Palin is in court in New York, suing the New York Times over an opinion column she says linked her political rhetoric to a mass shooting, in a case which could have far-reaching implications for US libel law. Cindy McCain has been censured by her state party for opposing Trump. Joe Biden, Obama’s vice-president who beat Trump in 2020, made her ambassador to the United Nations food agency.",Arts/Books,"‘Let’s do it’: John McCain knew Palin VP pick was a huge gamble, new book says",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/07/lets-do-it-john-mccain-palin-gamble-book-insurgency-republicans-trump
2/7/2022,"For fans of the terpsichorean arts, this documentary about the creation, rehearsal and debut of the 2019 work Mám, by Irish dance and theatre troupe Teac Damsa, will be a treat. That’s especially true given the pandemic disrupted Mám’s scheduled tour, so this may be one of the few chances for people to see some of it, although crucially not the whole thing. Instead, slow-cinema maestro Pat Collins (last seen with ethnology documentary Henry Glassie: Field Work) and no doubt longsuffering editor Keith Walsh have excerpted an assortment of moments and passages from the final staged version that they’ve montaged nimbly together, although sometimes the music heard doesn’t correspond to the dancing seen. Mám lacks any kind of story, and its creation was more about process than product for choreographer Michael Keegan-Dolan and his ensemble, and so the film’s fragmentary, sliced-view approach works just fine. Keegan-Dolan, best known for his work in ballet and choreography for the Royal Opera House, explains to his collaborators near the start that he wants to make something that evades the usual hierarchies of dance, opening up a space for the performers to be as instrumental in the creative process as either Keegan-Dolan or his key collaborator Rachel Poirier (she’s also his wife). Meanwhile, just as essential to the process is the input from bravura concertina player Cormac Begley, who pulls together the score in a parallel collaboration with stargaze, a musical combo using traditional instruments to make a heady sound that’s closest to contemporary classical but with bits of jazz and folk thrown in.  For all the abstraction of the show, which involves animal masks, soft-shoe shuffling, manic twirling, and an interlude where dancer James Southward goes around snogging everyone on stage, there are some surprisingly emotional moments. For example, Keegan-Dolan enjoins the dancers to move as if they’re showing a beloved, dying relative everything about their craft in one frenzied performance, and this stirs up strong feelings. Elsewhere, Collins’s camera watches the catering team preparing to feed everyone as they work at the troupe’s rehearsal space in Kerry and that helps to enhance the sense of place that’s somehow embedded deep in the show’s own ineffable themes.  The Dance is in cinemas from 11 February.",Arts/Film,The Dance review – slow-cinema maestro offers a glimpse behind the scenes,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/07/the-dance-review-slow-cinema-maestro-offers-a-glimpse-behind-the-scenes
2/7/2022,"Today in a nutshell: Men’s downhill honours went to Beat Feuz of Switzerland as Kamila Valieva produced another world-first figure skating performance Next up: Later today the curling mixed doubles reaches the semi-final stage, and we’ll see the mixed ski jumping. Tomorrow’s early action features the men’s Super-G and a US v Canada ice hockey face-off  Beat Feuz of Switzerland is the king of the mountain, winning the men’s downhill by just 0.10 seconds ahead of 41-year-old Johan Clarey of France, who became the oldest man to win an Olympic medal in Alpine skiing. “I can’t think of anything more beautiful than flying home with a gold medal around my neck,” said Feuz. Sweden’s Sara Hector won the women’s giant slalom in two runs either side of the rescheduled men’s downhill. Hector said: “It’s been so much all day. I’ve been so nervous. It’s so much feeling, it’s crazy. It’s for sure a lot of joy.” Italy’s Federica Brignone took silver and Switzerland’s Lara Gut-Behrami bronze. Mikaela Shiffrin’s bid for a record medal haul got off to a rocky start when she missed a gate early in the first run and was DQ’d, and the race was halted for 15 worrying minutes while her compatriot Nina O’Brien was stretchered off after a crash. A US team spokesperson has since said she is “alert and responsive”. Fifteen-year-old Kamila Valieva landed the first quad by a woman in Olympic competition, as the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) claimed their expected gold in the team figure skating. The US took silver, Japan the bronze. “I’m very happy to land two quadruple jumps and a triple axel. It’s an incredible feeling to be skating in your first senior season and people are already talking about you,” Valieva said. Lightning nearly struck twice in two days in the speed skating as Japan’s Miho Takagi looked set to take gold with a new Olympic record on the final run of the women’s 1,500m – just as Nils van der Poel did in the men’s 5,000m yesterday. However, she made a tiny error in the final run-in, which meant Ireen Wüst’s agonising wait ended with another gold for the Netherlands and her brand new Olympic record left standing. Takagi ended up with silver, Antoinette de Jong of the Netherlands took bronze. Canada’s failure to beat Italy in their final mixed doubles curling match confirmed this evening’s semi-final lineup will see a still-unbeaten Italian pair face Sweden, while Norway and Great Britain have an instant rematch of the game Norway won 6-2 yesterday. Canada enjoyed success in the men’s slopestyle snowboarding though, with a gold for Max Parrot and a third consecutive Olympic bronze for Mark McMorris. China’s Su Yiming snuck in for silver and the hosts’ second medal of the Games. “I don’t know how to express my feeling. I have never felt such feelings in my life,” Su said. Parrot won silver at Pyeongchang in 2018, then had to take time away from sport after being diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma. “I was going through a true nightmare,” Parrot said. “And just the thought of snowboarding was my dream at that point.” Yesterday’s late medals included Johannes Ludwig of Germany winning the men’s singles luge, while Ryoyu Kobayashi of Japan won the men’s normal hill ski jumping. Jakara Anthony became Australia’s first Winter Olympics gold medallist since 2010, winning the freestyle skiing women’s moguls. She said: “It’s all still sinking in but I was so grateful to be able to celebrate with my team last night and share the experience with Tess [Coady], both getting podiums on the same day.” Canada’s women’s ice hockey match with the ROC was delayed by an hour before players returned to the ice wearing face masks. No reason was given, but Canadian media reported ROC had not provided Canada with their Covid test results. Canada won 6-1. In the other match so far today, Denmark have given themselves hope of progressing by recording their first victory, 3-2 over the Czech Republic. Defending champion Mikaela Shiffrin out of giant slalom on first run Olympic hockey match delayed before players return to ice in masks Peng Shuai says Weibo post sparked ‘enormous misunderstanding’ A lot of athletes struggled with the fourth shooting round as Denise Herrmann prevailed in the women’s 15km biathlon to win Germany’s second gold. Despite picking up one shooting penalty, she finished 9.4 seconds ahead of France’s Anais Chevalier-Bouchet. Times are all in local Beijing time.
