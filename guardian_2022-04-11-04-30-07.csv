4/11/2022,"When the far-right Marine Le Pen posed for a selfie with a smiling teenager in a Muslim headscarf in Dunkirk on the northern coast, it was a turning point in the presidential campaign. Le Pen wants to ban the Muslim headscarf from all public places, including the streets, calling it a “uniform of totalitarian ideology”. So after posing happily with a girl in hijab, she was attacked for going soft by her far-right rival, the TV pundit Éric Zemmour. “Let me teach you about humanity,” Le Pen shot back at one of Zemmour’s lieutenants in a TV debate that went viral. “What would you have done? Pulled her veil off and mistreated her?” One analyst called Le Pen’s tactic of appearing softer in person than her policy proposals a “masterclass”. She also sought to present herself as less dangerous than Zemmour’s extremist newcomers on France’s tense and fractured political scene. It was mid-March; her poll ratings took off and kept rising. Le Pen, 53, who has been a member of parliament for five years, has created a distance between her smiling persona – posing with her pet Bengal cats or being mobbed by teenagers for selfies in the street – and the radical reality of her far-right, anti-immigration manifesto to keep France for the French. She has promised a referendum to change the constitution in order to curb the rights of immigrants and foreigners. She aims to prioritise natives over non-natives for housing, benefit jobs and healthcare. She would scrap nationality rights for children born and raised in France by foreign parents. Her success in reaching the runoff against Macron on Sunday is not just about her long-running drive to sanitise her party’s image and move it away from the jackbooted and antisemitic imagery of the past. That Le Pen is now closer to power than ever before is in part the result of her own rethink of political strategy. Le Pen’s analysis of Emmanuel Macron’s five years in power – which have included the gilets jaunes anti-government protests – was that Macron was a polarising figure who had angered and divided the country, and was out of touch with people’s everyday concerns. Unlike her two previous populist presidential campaigns – in which she furiously sought to harness people’s anger – this time she decided voters were exhausted by years of demonstrations and wanted calm. She positioned Macron as the divisive one, and herself as someone who could unite. Instead of holding big rallies, Le Pen went under the radar to visit markets in small towns and villages, listening and posing for selfies. Instead of pushing her anti-immigration platform – which remains just as radical as before – she focused on the cost of living crisis that risked being worsened by the war in Ukraine. She condemned the Russian invasion outright and played down her visit to Vladimir Putin five years ago. To advance her position, Le Pen put forward her own personal narrative of suffering. Five years ago, her supporters had been horrified when she performed so badly in the 2017 presidential TV debate against Macron – mixing up names of companies, getting dossiers wrong — that it was described as “political death live on air”. She was written off as finished. But she believed that voters would identify with a personal story of picking herself up after defeat. “People who have lived through painful moments can better understand the suffering and distress of others,” she said. She talked about her difficult childhood as the child of a demonised political figure, Jean-Marie Le Pen, like her a far-right presidential candidate, describing how aged eight she woke in her nightdress amid shards of glass and a blown-away bedroom wall following a bomb attack aimed at killing her father. She talked about her teenage embarrassment at her parents’ public divorce battle, during which her mother posed nude in Playboy. The gilets jaunes protests had highlighted the difficulties of single mothers; Le Pen described raising her own children alone. When her niece, Marion Maréchal, abandoned Le Pen and joined rival Zemmour, Le Pen was emotional on TV, saying she had helped raise Marion as a baby. Le Pen rose in the polls while Zemmour dropped, damaged by his previous admiration of Putin and initial refusal of Ukrainian refugees. Ultimately, Le Pen knew that to have any chance of winning the final round, she must neutralise the nation’s fear of her. Supporters of traditional parties on the left and right had in the past voted tactically to keep her out because she was seen as dangerous, divisive and unable to govern the country or run the economy. But Le Pen reasoned that those parties, the Socialists and Les Républicains, were shrinking on the national stage. By focusing on fears over the cost of living, Le Pen began to turn public opinion around. In September 2021, Le Pen was the 11th most popular political figure in France – already a high position. This month she rose to become the nation’s second favourite political personality, behind the former prime minister Édouard Philippe. Last week, the pollster Brice Teinturier of Ipsos found that if Le Pen were elected president tomorrow, more people expected an improvement in their own situation and the situation of the country than if Macron were re-elected. Just as many people trusted Le Pen to fix cost of living crisis as trusted Macron. An Odoxa poll for L’Obs found that in a second-round vote, 19% of people would vote to stop Macron, more than the 18% who would vote to stop Le Pen. The think-tank Fondation Jean-Jaurès last year set out the factors that could facilitate a Le Pen win. She would need to win over large numbers of voters from the traditional right. She would need to have normalised her image to the point where voters no longer found her so dangerous that they voted tactically to keep her out. Macron would have to be viewed with the same general level of mistrust as Le Pen herself to make voters refuse to vote for him. Macron’s tactic so far has been to remind voters of the details of Le Pen’s manifesto, slamming it as a racist, anti-Muslim platform that would wreck the economy and create mass unemployment. But Macron’s camp has found it harder to make criticism stick to Le Pen. Le Pen argues that catastrophising against her no longer works. She said French people no longer see her “as the big, bad wolf”.",News/World news,How Le Pen tried to soften image to reach French election runoff ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/10/how-le-pen-tried-to-soften-image-to-reach-french-election-runoff
4/11/2022,"The centrist Emmanuel Macron will face the far-right Marine Le Pen in the final round of the French presidential election, after topping Sunday’s first round with 28% to her 23%, according to initial projected results. France now faces a brutal two-week battle over the country’s future, as Macron once again styles himself as a pro-European “progressive” trying to face down what he calls Le Pen’s “racist”, anti-Muslim, nationalist programme and her “complacency” with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, amid the war in Ukraine. Macron scored higher than his result in the first round five years ago, and clearly gained support in the final hours of the campaign after his warnings to voters to hold back the far-right and protect France’s place on the international diplomatic stage as fighting continues in Ukraine. But Le Pen’s score was also higher than five years ago. She had steadily gained support after campaigning hard on the cost of living crisis and the inflation that is hitting households and has become voters’ biggest concern. The hard-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon came in third place with a higher than forecast 20% of the vote, cementing his leading position on the left after campaigning on the cost of living and transforming the presidential system. The far-right TV pundit Eric Zemmour, who had convictions for incitement to racial hatred, and had run as an outsider on anti-immigration platform came fourth with 7% of the vote – lower than he had hoped. But the biggest shock of the night was the very low score of Valérie Pécresse, the candidate for Nicolas Sarkozy’s traditional right Les Républicains. She took only 5% of the vote – a poor showing which is likely to lead to the implosion of her party in favour of its hardliners. This could leave France in a unique position in Europe without a traditional mainstream right. The decline of the traditional parties of government was confirmed by the Socialist party’s candidate and mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, scoring only 2%. The Greens’ Yannick Jadot scored 4.4% despite the environment being among French voters’ top concerns. The second-round on 24 April will now be a replay of Macron and Le Pen’s last bruising election battle in 2017. But the stakes are much higher than when Macron easily beat Le Pen with 66% of the vote five years ago – which was seen as a victory against populist politics in the wake of Donald Trump’s election to the US White House and Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. Macron conceded on the campaign trail he had not managed to calm voters’ concern on immigration and hold back the “fears” that led people to vote for extremes. Polls over the last week have shown Le Pen as high as 49% for the potential second-round run-off. For the first time, these scores are in the margin of error and give Le Pen the mathematical chance of winning. A battle began on Sunday night for both Macron and Le Pen to hoover up support from the smaller candidates. The choice of Mélenchon’s voters will be key. The majority of his leftwing supporters five years ago opted to vote for Macron in the second round simply to keep out Le Pen. But polls this time have suggested, some of them might be tempted to vote Le Pen in protest against Macron. Immediately after the projections were announced Hidalgo, Pécresse and Jadot clearly asked their supporters to vote for Macron in the second round, saying it is essential to block the progress of the far right. For the first time, Le Pen, is able to benefit from a reservoir of transferable votes in the second round. About 80% of the votes of far-right TV pundit Éric Zemmour, are now expected to transfer to Le Pen. Turn-out was lower than five years ago but higher than the record in 2002 – with abstention forecast at about 26%. Macron is now seeking to be the first French president to win a second term in 20 years despite a mood of pessimism and disillusionment with politics in France. He entered the race late and said repeatedly that he didn’t have the ability to campaign fully because he was occupied on diplomacy over the war in Ukraine and phone-calls to Putin and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Macron’s election platform includes gradually raising the retirement age to 65, which is unpopular and controversial, as well as centralising the benefits system and making unemployed people on certain forms of benefits undertake 15 to 20 hours of activity a week. Macron has defended his record in office, saying unemployment was at its lowest in 15 years, and promising he could bring full employment. He argued he was the European leader who has done the most to lessen the impact of inflation on households, but on campaign walkabouts he was greeted with angry shouts from people complaining they couldn’t make ends meet. Le Pen’s radical, far-right anti-immigration platform would involve banning the Muslim headscarf from all public places, including the street. But by focusing on families’ difficulties to make ends meet she managed to neutralise the historical fear of her party, and this month became France’s second favourite political personality, behind the former prime minister Édouard Philippe. Le Pen’s campaign material, printed before the war in Ukraine, still featured a picture of her smiling with Vladimir Putin whom she met in 2017. But her swift condemnation of the invasion succeeded in drawing voters’ attention away from her previous pro-Russia stances.",News/World news,Macron on 28% to Le Pen’s 23% in projected first round French election results,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/10/macron-on-28-to-le-pens-23-in-first-round-projected-french-election-results
4/11/2022,"Australian soaps have spawned an enormous amount of pop music – from true classics to earworms you’ve buried away in your deep subconscious. We’re reaching the end of an era now that Neighbours is ending, so we’re counting down the best songs to have come from soap stars who took part in the time-honoured tradition of stepping into a recording studio and giving it a red-hot go. And we’re sorry for the overwhelming whiteness of this list. Australian soaps have not traditionally been beacons of diversity and inclusion. This Real Housewife of Sydney’s signature pop song knocked Grease Megamix (the third best-selling single of 1991) out of the No 1 position on the Aria charts. It also established a template for soap-to-pop stardom that would be followed for years to come with its flirty, confident lyrics and straightforward danceability. It created another legacy, too: the video stars a young Simon Baker. A charmed Tkautz introduced him her boss on E Street, landing him his first acting role. Little has been written about the former Home and Away star’s pop career. And that’s probably fair enough. But we’ll happily fight for her 2002 debut single, All Seats Taken. The song is ostensibly about reserving an entire venue for a romantic, intimate night, which is something we can imagine Cartwright and her husband, Lleyton Hewitt, doing when they first got together. The lyrics suggest that the venue is a restaurant but the music video is filmed in a roller disco. Sadly, there’s no skating in the video, which perhaps explains why her pop career never reached the heights of fellow Australian blond bombshell and roller disco enthusiast Olivia Newton-John. The E Street actor was signed to the same label as her co-star Tkautz, but Read My Lips was deemed too raunchy for her – so she struck gold in 1992 with the more dreamily flirty In Your Room, which peaked at No 10 on the Aria charts. While her second single I Want You scored Pearen an Aria nod, In Your Room is the lovelier track. There’s something wonderfully specific, and perfectly lust-struck, about the idea of getting into a love interest’s bedroom and trying on all the clothes. The British pop songwriting trio Stock Aitken Waterman wrote plenty of Minogue earworms early on in her career, and some of Donovan’s biggest hits. But none can surpass the pop cultural moment of 1988’s Especially for You, released not long after Donovan and Minogue’s characters on Neighbours, Scott and Charlene, were married. It’s schmaltz of the irresistible variety, and was especially huge in the UK, where it became the fourth highest-selling record of the year. The Neighbours actor comes from a soap-opera family: her half-brother, Jason Donovan, his daughter Jemma and his father, Terence, have all appeared on the soap. The making of her album, Tightrope, was the subject of a 2006 reality TV show, which sounds like a bit much until you realise the songwriters have also written bops for Janet Jackson, Jennifer Lopez and Britney Spears. The album has an aggressively of-the-moment pop-rock sound that would be instantly forgettable if it didn’t include a truly bonkers cover of the Burt Bacharach/Hal David classic Wishin’ and Hopin’. And then there’s Mistake, a perfectly assembled slice of lost-love-catharsis with a chorus that just begs you to scream along. Goodrem debuted Born to Try, her first No 1 single, in 2002 on Neighbours, while playing an aspiring singer called Nina Tucker. Unlike other soap stars-turned-singers, Goodrem’s stint on the show was as much about launching her music career as television stardom. The piano pop ballad was our first introduction to her musical style but actually not her debut single. That came a year earlier with the poppy I Don’t Care (penned by the writers behind Christina Aguilera’s Genie in a Bottle), which failed to make much of an impact. Thankfully, Sony realised she was more comfortable behind a piano in singer-songwriter territory. Born to Try is one of her best, with a brilliant, soaring vocal. The lyrics might be a bit on the naive side but we can probably cut the 17-year-old Goodrem some slack there. Here come the drums. In 2004 the Melbourne electronic rock band Rogue Traders added a celebrity to their lineup: Natalie Bassingthwaighte, who earned three Logie nominations for playing Izzy Hoyland in Neighbours. When they released Voodoo Child, they kept their identity of their new vocalist a secret at first: they didn’t want to cash in on her celebrity. The track reached No 4 on the Aria charts and was certified platinum. There are a few reasons why: first, there’s the re-recorded version of Elvis Costello’s Pump it Up riff, a magic ingredient that still kills (see Olivia Rodrigo’s Brutal), and there’s the Traders’ electro-punk playfulness. But it’s Nat Bass’s vocals, pop pacing and clarity, with a little rock-tinged growl, that pulls it all together. In many ways, Kiss Kiss was both a blessing and a curse as Holly Valance’s debut single: the Neighbours’ alum’s cover of the English-language cover of Turkish artist Tarkan’s Şımarık (Spoilt) is just sexy-pop-fun enough to be irresistible. The 2002 track reached No 1 in Australia and cracked the top 10 in 17 countries. While her two follow-up singles performed well, she could never match the dizzying heights of Kiss Kiss. The music video, directed by Tim Royes, remains a classic with its indulgent close-ups of Valance’s red lips, wet-look hair and louche choreography. The “mwahs” are both silly and hypnotic. A masterpiece. Dannii, a Home and Away alum, followed big sister Kylie’s chart-topping Fever album with her own collection of disco-tinged electro-pop: 2003’s Neon Nights. It’s such a strong album (lead single Put the Needle On It is super sexy and refined, while Creep was right in the pop zeitgeist) that it feels unfair of us to even mention Kylie here. For the record, it’s as good as anything Kylie has released. I Begin to Wonder is the standout, with its rapid-fire verses and cooing choruses. 2002’s Love at First Sight was the third single from Minogue’s Fever album, at the height of her career renaissance. It’s three minutes and fifty-seven seconds of unadulterated joy. When Minogue sings “everything went from wrong to right”, you’d be hard-pressed to argue. The song scored the singer her first Grammy nomination and always provides the perfect hands-in-the-air Kylie-style love-in at her live shows. Pop doesn’t come much more effortlessly cool than this 2001 track. The insistent, pulsating bassline drives home the obsession inherent in the lyric; it is endlessly danceable; and its futuristic music video features one of Minogue’s most celebrated looks: a flowing white jumpsuit cut all the way down to her navel, testing the limits of both physics and nipple tape. The song was initially offered to Sophie Ellis Bextor and S Club 7, but it’s difficult to think of another artist who could bring the intimacy and all-encompassing desire to life in this simplest of melodies. Minogue says she wanted to record the song after hearing just 20 seconds of the demo. Thank God she did. Thank God S Club 7 didn’t. Sometimes a perfect pop song is just waiting for the right artist. Scott Cutler and Anne Preven (who co-wrote Beyoncé’s Dreamgirls number Listen) wrote Torn with Phil Thornalley, who also wrote Shannon Noll’s Drive (!!!). They recorded it themselves as Ednaswap, then Liv Sørensen released the Danish-language version Brændt, and Trine Rein’s version hinted at its pop future. But when Imbruglia left Neighbours for Torn, everything fell into place. Her take paired refreshingly ready emotion with a music video directed by Alison Maclean that has Imbruglia singing into the camera as though she’s confessing her feelings into a mirror. Talk about relatable pop: no wonder it was the 1997 No 1 on airplay around the world. This 1993 cover of Melba Moore’s 1976 disco gem doesn’t mess much with the original winning formula, with a very 90s dance-pop beat thrown in by the producers Tim Lever and Mike Percy (of Dead or Alive fame). While this single was released at the tail-end of Minogue’s first phase as a pop artist and received mixed reviews from critics, it’s a stayer: her vocals are an instant uplift – a whole room will get on its feet if you play the track in a gay club. It does exactly what a pop song is supposed to do: it changes the mood in the room. Try to listen to it without smiling. In 2003 Goodrem was everywhere. Not only did she release Innocent Eyes, the highest-selling album of the decade, but she was still a Neighbours regular. The second single, Lost Without You, stands as one of the best Australian pop recordings of the past few decades. It’s one of just three songs from her debut album which Goodrem didn’t write herself, but its dramatic structure, cascading piano riffs and tear-soaked lyrics all make it classic Delta. It became even more beloved when Darren Hayes covered the song at the 2003 Aria awards in an emotional tribute to Goodrem, who won seven awards that night but was unable to perform as she was recovering from treatment for Hodgkin’s lymphoma. 1. Better the Devil You Know by Kylie Minogue There could only be one No 1, and it could only be Kylie. This 1990 tune is the best of Kylie and the best of pop: a dancefloor sensation with a melody that builds, double backs and repeats. This song gave her a more mature sound – along with a more “grown-up” presentation that Pete Waterman was convinced would end her career. Instead, it revealed her true strength and staying power and placed herat the forefront of the then rising trend of electronic pop. Before this song, Kylie was beloved. After Better the Devil You Know, she was a superstar.",Arts/Music,The 15 best singles by Australian soap stars – sorted,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/11/the-15-best-singles-by-australian-soap-stars-sorted
4/11/2022,"Just under a third of the 151 seats in the House of Representative are in New South Wales, making the state crucial battleground. Labor has 10 seats in NSW on margins of less than 5%. With the Coalition fearing losses in Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria, its fate could rest on how many NSW marginal seats it can nab. Here’s a closer look at some of the seats in play. Macquarie, taking in parts of the outer west of Sydney as well as the Blue Mountains and some of the Hawkesbury, is the most marginal seat in the country, held by Labor with a margin of 0.2%. Susan Templeman has held the seat since 2016 but won by just 371 votes at the last election. Since 2019, the electorate has been hit by bushfires and floods, so recovery is likely to be front of mind for voters. Templeman will be up against Liberal candidate Sarah Richards who is a Hawkesbury local councillor. It is considered a must-win by the Coalition to help balance expected losses elsewhere in the state. Eden-Monaro, which covers the south-east of NSW, surrounding the ACT, was known as Australia’s bellwether seat, having been won by the party that formed government at every election from 1972 to 2016. Since 2016, however, it has been held by Labor, currently on a margin of 0.9%. The former Bega Valley Shire mayor Kristy McBain claimed the seat by 735 votes at a 2020 by-election following the retirement of popular Labor MP Mike Kelly. She has a head start on Liberal candidate Jerry Nockles, a navy veteran and Pharmacy Guild of Australia executive, who was selected by the party only last week following the federal takeover of the NSW division. The affluent seat takes in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, including Bondi, Darling Point, Paddington, Rose Bay and Vaucluse. It was previously held by Liberal leaders John Hewson and Malcolm Turnbull, though when the latter resigned in 2018, high-profile independent Kerryn Phelps won the seat. Liberal Dave Sharma reversed the by-election result at the 2019 election, winning the seat with a 1.3% margin. Sharma now faces a challenge from another independent – Allegra Spender, a businesswoman and the daughter of the late fashion designer Carla Zampatti and the former Liberal MP John Spender. Spender is one of several climate-focused independents targeting Coalition seats and hopes to replicate Zali Steggall’s success in Warringah at the last election. Last month, Sharma denied he was trying to distance himself from the Liberal party following accusations his campaign material mimics Spender’s teal colour scheme. Reid, covering part of Sydney’s inner-west and middle-ring suburbs, is one of the most multicultural electorates in NSW and was considered a Labor stronghold until Liberal Craig Laundy’s win in 2013. According to the 2016 census, 56.3% of people who live in Reid were born overseas and 55.3% speak a language other than English at home. Child psychologist Fiona Martin won the seat for the Liberals with a margin of 3.2% in 2019, following Laundy’s retirement. She most recently made headlines when she crossed the floor with four other moderates to vote down Morrison’s religious freedoms bill. She is up against Labor’s Sally Sitou, who is of Chinese heritage. Hunter, covering the coalmining zone in the Cessnock, Singleton and Muswellbrook local government areas, has been held by Labor since February 1936. But the Nationals and One Nation are vying for the seat following the retirement of Labor stalwart Joel Fitzgibbon, whose margin was cut to a slender 3% in 2019 as the One Nation vote surged. Labor’s national executive chose coalminer and Olympic shooting medallist Daniel Repacholi as the party’s candidate, angering local members and triggering the nomination of several independents.",News/Australia news,"Seats to watch at the federal election in NSW, where both sides are defending key marginals ",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/11/seats-to-watch-at-the-federal-election-in-nsw-where-both-sides-are-defending-key-marginals
4/11/2022,"Victoria was dubbed the “Massachusetts of Australia” by former prime minister John Howard, following Labor’s landslide victory at the 2018 state election, due to its progressive bent. Indeed, the Coalition holds just 15 of 38 seats in the state. Labor holds 21, and the Greens and an independent hold Melbourne and Indi respectively. But in a tight election, Victoria could be decisive. Here’s a closer look at some seats at play. Currently held by the Liberal party with a margin of 0.5%. Located in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs, the electorate of Chisholm is the government’s second most marginal seat. It won the seat in 2016 when Julia Banks was the Liberal candidate. She quit the party in late 2018 after the leadership spill that saw Morrison become prime minister. The Liberals chose Gladys Liu as her replacement. Liu, who was born in Hong Kong, snared Chisholm by just under 1,100 votes at the 2019 election. The seat is one of the country’s most diverse – according to the 2016 census data 56.6% of people who live in Chisholm have parents who were born overseas and 50% spoke a language other than English at home. It will be interesting to see how the government’s attacks on Labor over its position on China translate in the seat, given its large Chinese-Australian population. Labor is running former Victorian Trades Hall Council assistant secretary Carina Garland in the seat. She was named as candidate in July 2021, so has been preparing for some time. It is considered a must-win for the party. Currently held by the Labor party with a margin of 1%. The electorate of Corangamite takes in the Bellarine Peninsula, including the surf coast towns of Barwon Heads and Torquay, and the southern suburbs of Geelong. It is currently held by Labor’s Libby Coker, who beat out now senator Sarah Henderson for the seat in 2019. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Having taken leave as Geelong mayor, Stephanie Asher is the Liberal candidate this time around. She ran as an independent for the federal seat of Corio at the 2013 election but joined the Liberal party in 2018. The Liberals are confident they can reclaim the seat. Both Morrison and opposition leader Anthony Albanese have made several visits this year. Currently held by the Liberal party with a margin of 3.7%. The blue-ribbon electorate of Higgins is located in Melbourne’s inner east and was previously held by Peter Costello, and prime ministers John Gorton and Harold Holt. It takes in suburbs such as Armadale, Toorak and Glen Iris as well as South Yarra and Prahran, which the Greens hold at a state level, as well as Carnegie, Ormond and Murrumbeena, which has traditionally voted Labor. In 2019, after Liberal MP Kelly O’Dwyer retired, the seat became a hard-fought battle between Labor, the Liberals and the Greens. Liberal MP Katie Allen won out and this time she’ll face Labor candidate Michelle Ananda-Rajah and Greens’ Sonya Semmens. Currently held by the Liberal party with a margin of 7.8%. Another blue-ribbon seat, currently held by junior government minister Tim Wilson who faces a challenge from former ABC reporter turned independent Zoe Daniel. It is located in the south-east and takes in the bayside suburbs of Brighton, Sandringham, Black Rock and Beaumaris. The candidates recently made headlines when Wilson complained to the local council that residents were prematurely displaying signs in support of Daniel, and also encouraged people to dob in other neighbours for doing so. The electorate is one of several held by the Coalition being targeted by climate-focused independents. In nearby Kooyong, treasurer Josh Frydenberg is facing a challenge from Monique Ryan. Currently held by the National party with a margin of 20%. Nicholls, formerly Murray, is a regional electorate north of the state, taking in the towns of Shepparton, Echuca, Cobram, Yarrawonga, Boort and Bridgewater. While the seat is held by the Nationals by a comfortable margin, footballer-turned-politician Damian Drum is retiring. This has set the stage for an interesting battle between the Nationals, the Liberals – who held the seat between 1996 and 2013 – and Greater Shepparton deputy mayor and prominent local businessman Rob Priestly, who is running as an independent.",News/Australia news,The Victorian seats to watch this election in the state dubbed the ‘Massachusetts of Australia’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/11/the-victorian-seats-to-watch-this-election-in-the-state-dubbed-the-massachusetts-of-australia
4/11/2022,"Global turmoil has trickled into Australia’s supermarket aisles, hiking the prices of many staple foods. But the upward pressure isn’t evenly distributed. Bread – or, in fact, any wheat product, as well as eggs, meat and coffee beans are just a few casualties of spiralling inflation fuelled by punishing petrol prices, higher feed and fertiliser costs, conflict between major food exporters Russia and Ukraine, and tight global supply. Australian shoppers are facing a price rise “perfect storm” at the supermarket right now, says Prof Wendy Umberger, executive director of the Centre for Global Food and Resources at the University of Adelaide. While Australia ranks among the most food secure nations in the world, the blockage of wheat exports from Russia and Ukraine by Russia means domestic wheat producers are taking advantage of higher global export prices, she says. Bad news for bread and pastry lovers – wheat prices are forecast to remain high this year, according to the Department of Agriculture, Water and Environment, while Umberger says it will take up to 12 months after the global conflict to see the market return to normal. Both beef and lamb have also become more expensive, says Woolworths CEO Brad Banducci, with a lack of stock and the east coast drought the culprits. Retail prices are up 10% a kilo compared to this time last year, according to industry research body Meat and Livestock Australia. Dairy lovers are also likely to be crying into their milk, with lower cow numbers and decline in domestic production forecast. Dairy Australia’s John Droppert says droughts are a factor in lower stock numbers and labour shortages have affected milk production, while some dairy farmers are also taking advantage of high beef prices. As for fresh food prices, they’re being squeezed upwards by input costs and catastrophic weather conditions, says Shaun Lindhe, for peak industry body AusVeg, while labour shortages have meant some growers didn’t even plant, says Sydney Markets’ retail support manager and home economist Sue Dodd. “Climate change is even more concerning [for food security] than war,” says Umberger. “We are going to see more natural disasters leading to higher prices.” But before you consider taking a second job, it is still possible to fill your trolley without breaking the budget, says cook and author Belinda Jeffery, who favours sustainable, seasonal eating.Smart food selection and substitution, based on foods in plentiful supply, as well as being more adventurous with your menus, is the way to shop around inflation, she says. Apples: most varieties, from Royal Gala and Kanzi, to Pink Lady and Fuji, are now in season. Expect to pay $2 to $8 a kilo, says Dodd. Much, much cheaper than out of season berries, with varieties such as blueberries prices at around $56 a kilo at the supermarket. Avocados: prices for everyone’s smashed-on-toast favourite are low because avocados are more plentiful. “There’s been a very good growing season and a lot of extra supply coming out of Western Australia,” says Banducci. You’ll pay $1.20 up. Baby peas: bought frozen, they are excellent quality and not expensive, says Jeffery. (Around $3.80 a kilo.) “Try them with pasta, olive oil and a little chilli.” Broccolini: broccoli’s more glamorous cousin is now in season, meaning prices are down to $3 a bunch at markets. High in fibre, nutrients and with more protein than most other vegetables, it’s a good choice for greens. Carrots: a stable for salads, stews, casseroles and stir-fries, at $2 to $3 a kilo, they’re also better than celery, at around $6 a bunch, for a crunchy snack. Casserole beef: at around $18 a kilo compared to rump steak’s $45, it’s a slow cooker dream, says Jeffery. “Cheaper cuts such as stewing steak, shoulder or lamb or neck cutlets make flavoursome casseroles when combined with veggies, onions, garlic and potatoes.” Pork and chicken are also likely to be cheaper per kilo than prime beef, with prices holding, says Banducci. Cauliflower: around $3 to $6 each, this versatile cruciferous vegetable can be steamed, boiled, roasted, sautéed or mashed. Fresh and canned fish: while the price of popular varieties such as snapper are as high as $58 a kilo, cooking with varieties such as mullet or leather jacket is the way to save, says Jeffery. Canned fish can also be used in fishcakes, salads and bakes. Grapes: “There’s a great supply coming out of South Australia,” says Dodd. Prices range from $3 to $20 per kg, depending on quality. Ideal for school lunches, desserts, or snacks. Lemons and limes: both plentiful and useful for adding zing to salads, or sauces, rather than pricey dressings. You’ll pay $3 to $5 a kilo for lemons and 80c to $1.50 each for limes. Pomegranates: fabulous with lamb or fish, or with desserts, says Dodd, they can be found at farmers’ markets for around $1.50 each. Pumpkin: mash it, serve it roasted, or add it to frittata or pasta. From $1 to $2 a kilo. Sweet potato: spend $2 to $4.50 a kilo and get a foodies’ favourite that adds substance and satiety to meals with 20g of carbohydrate per 100g. Watercress: at $3 to $3.50 a bunch, it’s top value and likely to be cheaper than fancy lettuce. Cook it or use it in salads, says Dodd. 1. Compare your options At some farmers markets, you’ll get better, fresher ingredients and pay less, says Jeffery, because they cut out the middle man. If this isn’t the case in your area, it’s also worth checking specialty green grocers’ prices against the major supermarkets, as bigger does not always mean cheaper. 2. Buy what is in season “We get used to getting strawberries or blueberries all year, but buying what’s in season is nutritionally important and price superior,” Jeffery says. 3. Buy frozen veggies if fresh are too expensive Snap frozen, not stored – the nutrient content remains high. 4. Beans, beans, beans and legumes Load them up with potatoes, onions, spices and a handful of spinach for soups, suggests Jeffery. “We need to get away from the idea that meat and three veg is a meal.” 5. Think simple Bake potatoes and serve with fillings such as grated cheese, tuna, or avocado mash. 6. One chicken, three meals Buying a whole chicken is cheaper per kilo and means a roast one night, a curry the next, with the carcass can be used for making stock for a risotto. 7. Store fresh foods well Don’t wash greens before putting them in the fridge, just wrap them in a moist paper towel and put them in an airtight container or a compostable bag. They’ll last longer. 8. Grow your own herbs If you have no other space, grow your own, inexpensive herbs. “A little can really make a difference to food flavour,” says Jeffery. 9.

4/11/2022,"The Victorian government has called for at least 10 days of paid family violence leave to be offered to all workers, telling the Fair Work Commission a program for the state’s public servants saw about 64 people access the leave in the past year alone. The FWC is reviewing whether employees should be entitled to paid family violence leave under modern awards. Currently, all workers, including those who are casual and part-time, are entitled to five days of unpaid leave. Paid family violence leave has been included in all new Victorian public sector enterprise agreements, following the state’s royal commission into the issue in 2015. In its submission to the FWC review, the Victorian government said about 320,000 public sector employees across nine departments and 280 public sector agencies have access to 20 days of paid leave each year. The leave enables employees – without exhausting other forms of leave – to take time away from work to attend to urgent matters, seek safe housing, attend medical appointments, court hearings and police stations, or organise alternative care and school arrangements for their children. Across the Department of Health, the Department of Families, Fairness and Housing and the Department of Justice and Community and Safety – which have about 21,400 staff all together – an average of 0.3% of employees accessed paid family violence leave in the past year, the government said in the submission. This amounts to about 64.2 people. On average, each worker used up 8.56 days of their 20-day entitlement. Where paid family violence leave is exhausted, further leave has been provided on a case-by-case basis. Kate Seymour, a senior lecturer of social work at Flinders University, was part of a team that completed an analysis of Australia’s workplace agreement database for the FWC. They found a third of enterprise agreements approved by the commission included paid family violence leave for employees, the majority of which provide for 10 days of paid leave. She said the take-up of such leave has been small, as evidenced by Victoria’s submission, with the benefits “far outweighing” the associated costs to businesses. “If we can maintain women’s employment then that will have flow-on impacts in terms of not only their own economic productivity but also their ability to support themselves and their families,” Seymour said. She said the majority of women who have experienced family violence are employed but are likely to have disrupted work histories, having been forced to take time off, take on caring responsibilities or move cities or jobs. This can affect their superannuation balance, ability to borrow money or secure a rental property. “It’s hard to quantify or even to see but it has profound impact over the long-term career of women and also in terms of gender equality overall,” Seymour said. While casual workers weren’t entitled to paid family violence leave, the government said it has recently announced a two-year trial of five days of paid sick-leave for casual workers in eligible occupations. The industrial relations minister, Tim Pallas, said economic security could provide a crucial pathway out of violent relationships. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He said at least 10 days of paid family violence leave should be introduced in all modern awards, accompanied by an education campaign that promotes the benefits of paid leave to both the workplace and the affected employees. “Paid family violence leave provides practical, immediate support to help victims of family violence,” Pallas said. “It’s been an integral support for women in public sector roles in Victoria since 2015 and common sense and decency says that it should be extended to all workers.” In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14 and the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and the domestic abuse helpline is 0808 2000 247.

4/11/2022,"An Iraqi man who alleges 35 family members were killed when an Australian airstrike targeting Islamic State instead obliterated a house where civilians were sheltering has been denied a compensation payment by the federal government. The man, who did not wish to be identified, applied for what is known as an act of grace payment from the Department of Finance last year, arguing that there was strong evidence the Australian Defence Force dropped the bomb in 2017 as part of a series of airstrikes in Mosul by the coalition fighting IS. But in December he was informed the payment would not be made, despite the delegate who made the decision not having access to an ADF report on whether one of its F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets was responsible for the airstrike. It is understood the man, who is still based in Iraq, requested a payment in the low hundreds of thousands of dollars. Act of grace payments are made at the discretion of the government in special circumstances, including when a government entity has taken an action with an unintended result and no other compensation is available. The man claims 35 people from his extended family, including 14 children, nine women and two imams, seven of whom were direct family members, died when a bomb was dropped on a house in the Al Shafaar neighbourhood on 13 June 2017. In his application for an act of grace payment, the man’s Australian lawyers referred to information they argued supported the contention the ADF was responsible for the airstrike. This information included media statements made by the ADF confirming its involvement in coalition airstrikes that may have killed civilians in the same neighbourhood on the same day. In February 2019, the chief of joint operations, Air Marshal Mel Hupfeld, told reporters that two Australian planes had each dropped 500-pound bombs in Al Shafaar on 13 June 2017. The airstrikes had come at the request of Iraqi security forces, Hupfield said, who were fighting a desperate battle against IS to recapture the western part of Mosul. It was not until seven months later that the coalition became aware of reports the strikes had killed civilians after the matter was the subject of a report on the Airwars website, Hupfield said. Hupfield said that because of this delay the ADF had been unable to verify how many civilians were killed, and whether the deaths occurred as a result of the Australian airstrike, nearby coalition airstrikes or “from other actors”. It was estimated that between six and 18 civilians had been killed. He said the allegation the coalition was responsible for the deaths was assessed as “credible” but noted a degree of uncertainty surrounding the incident, including that the information provided about the strike did not “precisely correspond” with that held by the ADF. “We do not definitively know how these people were killed, but we do know from our review of the events that our aircrew made no error in this mission,” Hupfield said. “They delivered their ordinance precisely on to the designated target in accordance with their rules of engagement. All authorities for the strike were valid and lawful. “There was no specific intelligence to indicate civilians were present at the targeted site, but given the urgent circumstances facing the Iraqi forces at the time, it was impossible to be certain.” He went on to say that despite the airstrike hitting the exact coordinates provided by Iraqi force, “we’re not blaming the Iraqi security forces for this event or this incident. We’re very cognisant of the risk of inflicting civilian casualties in a very intense, complex war zone. “The action in Mosul was the most ferocious air campaign that we have seen in our generation. It is an unfortunate consequence of war that these civilian casualties have occurred, and as I’ve said, this is not lost on us.” In January 2019, the US defence department also assessed the report of civilian casualties as a result of a coalition airstrike as “credible”, finding that it was “likely” that 11 civilians were killed as a result of two coalition engagements on the same street. In the decision to deny the man an act of grace payment, the finance department delegate makes clear they have not seen the ADF report on the airstrikes. But the delegate said they nonetheless accepted the ADF’s advice that its investigation found there was no proof civilians were killed by an Australian airstrike. On 29 March this year, the man’s lawyers applied for an internal review of the decision and requested that a new delegate be assigned the case. Jacinta Lewin SC wrote that there was no other credible explanation for how the civilians were killed other than that the Australian government was responsible. “To the extent that there is uncertainty about the precise details of the Australian airstrikes, this is a product of Defence’s refusal to provide information about them,” she wrote. “Defence’s refusal should strengthen, rather than weaken, the conclusion that there is a real likelihood that Australian airstrikes were responsible for the deaths. If Defence possessed further information that weighed against that conclusion, presumably it would have been provided. “This is an extremely serious matter that has caused unimaginable loss and trauma.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a statement, Lewin, from Maurice Blackburn’s social justice practice, said it was concerning that the ADF was concealing its possible involvement in civilian casualties by refusing to release its investigation report. She said the man applied for it under freedom of information laws in February 2020, with the matter under review since July 2020 with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. “Knowing what our government is doing, that transparency and scrutiny, is critical to upholding our democracy. “How else do we know if our government is acting in the best interest of the Australian people, both here, and abroad?” A spokesperson for the finance department said it did not comment on individual act of grace payments. The department approved 166 act of grace payments totalling more than $16m last financial year.",News/Australia news,Iraqi man alleging 35 family members were killed by Australian airstrike denied compensation,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/11/iraqi-man-alleging-35-family-members-were-killed-by-australian-airstrike-denied-compensation
4/11/2022,"At the Heads Hotel, where the Shoalhaven River meets the sea, the locals are arguing about a strange grey object in the middle of the water. “It’s a bloody bandicoot,” one says. “Nah, it’s wrapped in plastic.” “Why would you wrap a bandicoot up in bloody plastic?” another says with a chuckle. The guessing game is the latest banter at what the locals reverently call “the table of knowledge” – or sometimes the “table of bullshit” – at the front bar of the Heads, sitting at knock-off time with a round of frothies under the watchful eye of two shiny stuffed marlins. Politics is usually off the agenda. But there are plenty of opinions for the group who live in “this paradise” on the New South Wales south coast. They need to build a wall at the river mouth. Fix the boat ramp. We need to wake up to China. Order the steak. And Scott Morrison? Is he in trouble? “Morrison? Oh, shit yeah. He is in big trouble,” Grant McLaurin says, happily calling him the “liar from the Shire” to rile up his drinking mates. “Let me put it this way – Labor is not putting up anything against him and I still think he is in trouble.” “I don’t think he should be,” Colin Mullholland counters from the other end of the table. “It’s a very hard job ScoMo has got. He’s walked in at a bloody bad time: bushfires, Covid, two floods.” “Who would want to be in charge?” Jan Dolden agrees. “I think he has done a good job and it hasn’t been easy.” Grant is a Labor voter. Jan and Colin say they are “sticking with ScoMo”. But perched on the corner of the table is Greg Gay, sitting quietly. He voted for Morrison last time, but is thinking of changing his vote. “I voted Liberal last time but I’ll most probably go back to Labor,” Gay says. “It’s just Scott Morrison. His decision making is a bit slow. By the time he decides to make something happen, he could have done it two weeks earlier. Just very slow off the mark.” But Gay says he is waiting to see what the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, comes up with, describing both parties as “very similar”. “That’s the part I am holding back on. Maybe you stay with the devil you know. But he really needs to come up with some positive decisions.” Morrison put Shoalhaven Heads – population 3,059 – on Australia’s political map soon after becoming leader, spending Christmas holidays there in 2018 and visiting again last year. Ahead of the May 2019 election he wrote an opinion piece about the “fellow travellers” he found at this modest waterfront watering hole, the so-called quiet Australians “who actually think Australia is a pretty great place and we don’t really have too much time to be angry”. Shoalhaven Heads is in the northern part of the marginal seat of Gilmore, a seat that hugs the Pacific coastline from Kiama in the north to Tuross Head in the south. It is held by Labor’s Fiona Phillips on a 2.6% margin. She won Gilmore at the last election after it had been in Liberal hands for the previous 23 years. A lot has happened in Gilmore since the last federal election. A pandemic. Floods. And, most crushingly, bushfires, which burned through an estimated 80% of the electorate during the Black Summer of 2019-20. There has been a lot to get angry about. And up and down the length of the seat, the memory of the fires – and Morrison’s decision to go to Hawaii at the time – is still raw. “There’s lots of anger still and sadness as well,” Maloneys Beach resident Nina Poulton says in Mogo, further south, which was mostly destroyed in the bushfires. “They say no one ever listens. There is still anger, hurt, a lot of tears still, a lot of hidden emotions, a lot of trauma still sitting there that surfaces. It’s been difficult since 2019. It wasn’t easy before that, but now all of these crises have happened.” Morrison is “not a leader”, Poulton says, comparing him unfavourably to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “We had the bushfires here, we were all impacted, the floods, and for any decision he’s been away, he’s not been present. He’s not what I call a good prime minister. He’s not a leader in my books. “He has just got nothing to offer.” Poulton is a Labor voter. No change this time around. Mogo business owner Vicki Pamount-Reid is a swinging voter and hasn’t made up her mind yet. Speaking to Guardian Australia on the front veranda of her business, just off Mogo’s main drag, she is still disappointed about Morrison’s infamous Hawaii trip. “He could have stayed here instead of going away when the bushfires were on, that was a dire emergency,” she says. “He shouldn’t have gone away. He should have been more empathetic. And when he visited Cobargo, nobody had anything. Nobody had fresh drinking water or petrol or anything, and he expected to be served by a cafe down there and it was just he really didn’t grasp what it was like for people.” But the anger doesn’t define her political outlook either, saying she believes Morrison has had a “really difficult time” with the pandemic, along with having to manage the natural disasters. “I think it wouldn’t matter what he did, people would say that he’s done the wrong thing. So you know, he’s a victim of the political machine in a way, I think.” This mix of sentiments is common – people are angry and disappointed with Morrison, but also sympathetic for the times he has found himself in. It’s also clear that many voters are still disengaged with the contest, and Albanese is yet to make much of an impression. “I really don’t know much about him. I haven’t heard much. I’ve seen him on the telly a couple of times,” Georgia Harmer in Batemans Bay says. She says she thinks Morrison, whom she voted for last time, has “done the best he could”, but is “sitting on the fence” for this election, listing childcare as a priority. In Vincentia, hospitality worker and artist Olivia Cooke says she doesn’t follow politics, but knows Morrison “is not the greatest guy”. And Albanese? Never heard of him. She might vote Greens or Labor, but is unsure. It’s easy to find people unhappy with Morrison, but harder to find the voters who have switched firmly into the Labor camp, with most still undecided. “I think he’s a bit of an opportunist,” says Barbara Doughty, an Ulladulla retiree, of Morrison. “In the beginning, I did like him, I thought he was doing really well, but he just seems to have got a bit too big for his boots.” But she is yet to decide for the forthcoming election, saying she intends to talk to the Liberal candidate, Andrew Constance, about transport issues in the seat. Cathy Davey, 57, of Terara, says she feels Morrison “has lost touch”, but says of Albanese: “I don’t like him.” Another for the undecided column. Kory Edwards, a 32-year-old small business owner, says it’s too early to write Morrison off. “I think, as a person and what he’s doing for the country has been all right. I just think people put a lot of pressure on him and everything that’s going on in the world. In Australia everyone’s put the blame on him in general. But I think ScoMo is doing all right.” With the Coalition lagging badly in the polls and needing to win seats to form a majority government, Gilmore is mentioned as one of the few seats the Liberals could win from Labor. The party is hoping Constance, whose former state seat of Bega overlaps Gilmore, can cancel out the anti-Morrison sentiment. He was a prominent critic himself of the prime minister as he advocated for his south coast community during the fires. Constance says the community was “100%” justified in its anger towards the government, saying he felt the same. “Channeling that anger into change is what’s important. And I feel that if we don’t as Australians learn from the last few years and make the change and our governments don’t make the changes, then it’s a disservice to our ongoing humanity.” He is promising to be “a fiercely independent voice” for Gilmore, but says the last thing the exhausted community needs is an adversarial political contest. “The big thing for me is making sure that this is a positive experience for the community,” he says, listing roads, housing and climate change as priorities. “We have some who have been left with lifelong trauma, me included, and I think to be able to see the community unified in survival, and then incredibly unified in recovery, there’s a lot that can be achieved working together. So if we put ourselves first as a community and park the politics, we can get a lot done.” But Phillips, who has spent the past term forging her links in the community, is blunt about the Coalition’s prospects in Gilmore: “Not a chance.” “I have been out there every single day with people in this community, right across the community,” she says in a leafy cafe garden opposite the Nowra church where she was married. “I am very well known around this local area. I’ve got very strong roots in this particular main population area. I’ve been there right through the floods, right through the bushfires, Covid, you name it. “I am definitely confident I have been doing everything possible to support people, and I think that’s the main thing that people want – to see you actually fighting for them.” She says the people of Gilmore have endured “one disaster after another” and were repeatedly let down by the government. She says disaster mitigation, housing and health will be the key focus of her campaign. “I think the people have just totally lost faith with the Morison government. It doesn’t matter whether it’s drought, bushfires, flood or Covid,” she says, pointing to business owners who couldn’t source Rat tests as an example. “They don’t forget those sorts of things.”",Opinion/Opinion,‘There’s lots of anger still’: locals in key NSW seat of Gilmore remain split on Morrison,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/11/theres-lots-of-anger-still-locals-in-key-nsw-seat-of-gilmore-remain-split-on-morrison
4/11/2022,"After being evicted from her short-term accommodation to make way for tourists, flood victim Margaret was left with nowhere else to go. “I would have been homeless, living out of my car with two dogs,” the 79-year-old said. After panicking all afternoon about where she would end up, Margaret, who asked that her surname not be published, received a last-minute call from the state-led Community Recovery Program informing her she would have a roof over her head for at least another week. “I feel like a hot potato,” she said. “I’m too old to be moved every seven days. It’s taken a lot out of me.” Margaret lives with a mobility disability and said she has been moved six times since she was evacuated from her Gympie home in February. She is not alone. According to advocacy groups, many people with disabilities are struggling to access appropriate support after flooding in northern NSW and Queensland. Margaret said under the recovery program, she has been repeatedly placed in unsuitable accommodation that does not cater to her needs. “I was first moved to a bed and breakfast in Imbil, where the closest town is 7km away. I thought how the heck am I supposed to get to town? Because there’s no public transport,” she said. She said she was later moved to a yurt in the mountains that only had an outdoor barbecue for cooking and no inside shower. “I had two falls there because I was really stressed out and then I had to be taken to hospital,” she said. “I don’t feel like I belong in my own country any more.” A coalition of 40 peak advocacy organisations have written an open letter demanding better resources and planning for disaster responses for people with disability. They say people with disability “continue to experience risks, neglect and serious negative impacts during disasters and emergencies”, resulting in “loss of services, supports and basic needs, as well as physical and psychological injuries”. “We cannot continue to underestimate the significant and long-term effectsof these events for people with disability and carers,” the letter states. Giancarlo de Vera, senior manager of policy at People With Disability Australia, said people with disability are feeling increasingly “forgotten” when it comes to emergency planning. “We’ve had stories of being stuck in danger and being isolated … We’ve heard about people losing their wheelchairs,” de Vera said. De Vera said people with disability are often turning to the community for assistance as they are not receiving sufficient support from the government. “They’re not seeing inclusive support … or decision-making quick enough,” de Vera said. “Throwing money at a problem doesn’t solve it. “We want … to be trusted, to be the driving stakeholder to create plans that protect us and keep us safe.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Queensland’s Department of Communities, Housing and Digital Economy declined to comment on any specific case due to privacy laws, but said it is providing “a range of assistance to people requiring short and longer-term accommodation.” “The department assists people with their housing needs, including through temporary and emergency accommodation such as hotels and motels, where they are unable to remain in their homes as they have been impacted by the flooding,” a spokesperson said. The spokesperson said housing assistance has been provided to 768 flood-affected households as of 31 March and a $600,000 Rapid Response Fund has been established “to deliver enhanced housing and homelessness services in impacted areas”. Overall, as of 7 April, 100,151 flood grant applications have been received by the government, with 42,810 payments totalling $17,776,546 made. But, in partnership with the University of Sydney, advocates are putting forward a series of recommendations for disaster management relating specifically to people with disabilities. These include creating nationally consistent standards to ensure disability representation in emergency management at all levels of government and prioritising collaborative and inclusive disability research. They call for resources, support, and advocacy for people with disability to self-assess their risks and tailor their emergency preparedness to their situation, as well as capacity development for service providers. The government should also provide explicit guidelines outlining who takes responsibility for the extra support needs of people with disability in emergency situations, they said. In the meantime, Margaret has been told it will be another 12 to 18 months until she can move back into her home. On the brink of 80, she said she feels exhausted by the constant moving. “People need to be treated like human beings – not like cattle that you move around as you see fit,” she said. “It plays havoc with your body and havoc with your mental state. Flood victims need better and more permanent accommodation. It could be made so much easier.”",News/Australia news,Advocates say people with disability are increasingly ‘forgotten’ in emergency planning,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/11/advocates-say-people-with-disability-are-increasingly-forgotten-in-emergency-planning
4/11/2022,"“This is about free water,” says Kirsty Howey of the Northern Territory Environment Centre. “Free water for irrigators. And they’re going to get it.” Water – how it is managed, who controls it and how much they get – is at the centre of a controversy over plans to massively expand agricultural production in the territory, and ultimately to link it to the huge Ord irrigation scheme across the border in Western Australia. In February, the Northern Territory Land Corporation (NTLC) released 67,500 hectares of land as part of the Keep Plains Development, where the farming industry hopes to grow fruit, nuts and cotton on a vast scale, but environmentalists argue that the effects on the region’s rivers, combined with changing rainfall patterns due to climate change, could be disastrous. The territory is home to large tracts of intact savannah ecosystem, free-flowing rivers and a rich biodiversity – but these systems have been much less intensively studied than other parts of Australia, and there are concerns that extracting large volumes of water may have unforeseen effects. “Water isn’t endless,” Howey says. “With a climate-altered future we might see these perennial rivers cease to flow in the dry season. “This is just going to open the floodgates – pardon the pun – for a whole other level of water extraction.” The Keep River rises near Newry Station in the Northern Territory, just on the border with Western Australia, before beginning its 258km run to the Timor Sea. Its catchment area spans 6,000 sq km, covering the traditional lands of the Gajerrong and Miriuwung people, home to several significant sacred sites. The estuary is in near-pristine condition and the remoteness of the nearby national park makes it a magnet for fishers, campers and those looking to disappear into nature. The 653km Ord River across the border is the site of one of the largest – and most costly – infrastructure projects in Australian history, aimed at opening up the tropical north to irrigated agriculture. The Ord irrigation scheme began as a vision to bend nature to the will of the farmer and the pastoralist. The first diversion dam was built in 1963, followed in 1972 by the construction of the main dam, forming Lake Argyle, Australia’s largest artificial reservoir by volume. The third phase – Ord 3 – would bring the system over the border into the Northern Territory and plug it into the Keep River with a series of canals. In February, the NTLC announced it had selected AAM Investment Group (Aamig), owned by the Brisbane-based agricultural investor Garry Edwards, as preferred developer of the Keep Plains Development after a two-year “publicly competitive process”. A spokesperson for the NTLC said in a statement the development had been “long awaited” on both sides of the WA and NT border and would contribute to the region’s food security while delivering “training, employment opportunities and sustainable development of regional and remote economies, with the engagement of Indigenous communities”. The spokesperson said Aamig was chosen “based on their experience, understanding of the region and their diversified proposal to cultivate a mix of dryland or seasonal crops, irrigated crops as well as pastoral or grazing operations to best suit the land areas within the Keep Plains site”. Aamig already has other investments in the area, including the huge Legune cattle station, which backs on to the Ord and has its own 50 gigalitre dam. Aamig must now obtain environmental, Aboriginal heritage and water approvals, and negotiate with native title holders, particularly around the treatment of sacred sites. Edwards declined to answer detailed questions from Guardian Australia, saying only: “AAM is in ongoing discussions with the Northern Territory Land Corporation to finalise aspects of the development arrangements, and all required approvals will be sought after these arrangements are finalised.”Howey says the government’s approach of selecting a developer and releasing land when no business case is publicly available – is like “putting the cart before the horse”. “Why would you release 67,000 hectares now?” she says. “There’s no plan, and no environmental impact studies. All it has is the thinnest of feasibility studies that indicate this land is subject to extreme flooding and a heightened risk of salinity because the depth to the watertable is so shallow and [because of] its proximity to the coast.” A feasibility study carried out by the Department of Environment, Parks and Water Security in 2019 found only a fraction of the area around Keep River was viable for agricultural production. In the area around lower Border Creek Plain, Upper Keep River Plain and Lower Keep River Plain, just 4,300 hectares of land was found to be “desirable” or “potentially desirable” for agricultural use. Howey says that should the Ord 3 expansion follow, it would carve canals and irrigation channels into the landscape and require the clearing of “vast swathes” of tropical savannah. The head of the NT Farmers Federation, Paul Burke, says irrigation will allow the production of mangoes, bananas, nuts and other crops, but current market conditions mean cotton will probably be “the backbone of the broader production system”. “The proposal will initially be a dry land production system, which relies on the monsoonal rain event,” Burke says. “As they move through, they’ll put in the infrastructure where the soils and access to water makes it possible to intensify to irrigated [production].” Cotton, a thirsty crop, is a tense subject in the Northern Territory, and there is another complicating factor. The territory government is reviewing regulations to allow more widespread use of flood plain harvesting – the practice of setting up small dams or catchments in flood plains or alongside rivers to capture water when they overflow during floods or monsoons. In the Murray-Darling Basin the practice has come under scathing criticism for drastically reducing river flows. The Northern Territory is unusual among Australian jurisdictions in that it does not charge irrigators to extract water from rivers. As a result, it doesn’t have funds to effectively monitor river flows and how much is being taken, says Maryanne Slattery, a consultant and former director of environmental water with the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. “You’ve got whole rivers that don’t have a single gauge on it,” Slattery says. She says large southern agricultural operators around the Murray-Darling Basin are increasingly eying off the Northern Territory’s water. “For those down south, the grass is greener up north,” Slattery says. “There’s less regulation and there’s no ongoing payment for the licence.” Slattery says the regulations the NT government is hammering out for flood plain harvesting are flawed as they rely on models built from partial data. The information gathered from rivers which are measured are extrapolated to make assumptions about rivers where flows have never been measured, she says. A spokesperson for the Department of Environment, Parks and Water Security said the “suggestion that water resources are not assessed, monitored, measured or managed is incorrect”. “Science underpins every water decision made by the [department] and undertaking feasibility studies provides certainty and clarity for all stakeholders.” Speaking more broadly, Dr Keller Kopf, a lecturer at Charles Darwin University research institute for environment and livelihoods, says the Northern Territory suffers from a lack of “baseline information” about its aquatic ecosystems. “How much water can be extracted [by flood plain harvesting] before adverse impacts can be seen – we don’t know,” Kopf says. Hanging over everything to do with the ambitious project are the uncertainties of climate change. Most forecasts suggest hotter conditions in the NT will lead to longer periods between wet seasons, higher evaporation rates that will threaten river systems and open air irrigation during dry periods, and heavier, more intense rainfall when rains do arrive. “It’s not clear whether this means a net increase in rainfall, or a net decrease,” Kopf says. “There may be more water over a short period of time, but the sum total of water flowing through these rivers may decline. “Just because there’s more intense rainfall events doesn’t mean flows in these rivers will increase. It’s possible – but the forecasting is that even if it does increase, it’s just as likely that flows on average may decrease owing to longer dry seasons and more severe drought.”",News/Australia news,‘Water isn’t endless’: the controversial plan to extend irrigated agriculture in NT’s tropical savannah,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/11/water-isnt-endless-the-controversial-plan-to-extend-irrigated-agriculture-in-nt-tropical-savannah
4/11/2022,"Just before half time of Saturday night’s game at the MCG, two very different footballers went toe-to-toe on the Members wing: Trent Cotchin, an articled clerk who plays a blue collar game, and Bailey Smith, who looks like he’s just stepped off a float at Royal Randwick. With Cotchin right on his hammer, Smith spilled a chest mark. The 32-year-old Tiger, who recently relinquished the Richmond captaincy, has always excelled at ground ball scrimmages. On this occasion, he was better balanced, a bit cannier and that little bit more ferocious than his 21-year-old rival. Cotchin got the faintest of fingers on a stationary ball, which released Noah Balta, and it led to a Tom Lynch goal. It’s the sort of action that doesn’t show up on stat sheets, and doesn’t garner Supercoach points. But it encapsulated a career, and the Richmond era. The Tigers were never going to lose after that. In previous weeks, Richmond sleepwalked through the final quarters of games against Carlton and St Kilda. Six days earlier, on a ground they’ve always hated, against a side that often gives them trouble, they conceded ten goals in a row. Their best player was mourning his dad. Their co-captain was injured. A host of others were clearly not right. Their ‘suffocate and surge’ trademark was conspicuously absent. The Tigers were 3-1-9 from their previous 13 games. “I think the Dogs can end Richmond’s season this week,” Matthew Lloyd said. The bookies wound them out to 2-1 outsiders. But Richmond would have fancied their chances. They always match up well against the Bulldogs. Jack Riewoldt and Dion Prestia slotted back in. The Dogs are undersized and far from convincing down back, and the loss of Alex Keath exacerbated that. As always, the Dogs racked up the stats. They had five of the six leading possession winners on the ground, nine more inside 50s, and won the centre clearance count 16 to 7. But it meant nothing. It was moments like Cotchin’s, along with about a dozen chase down tackles, that decided this match. The Tigers have never really made sense statistically. In 2017, they were amongst the lowest for disposals, and hit outs. They had the most clangers. The way they played didn’t really translate well to television. But when you saw them live, you understood. When you saw the state of the opposition players as they keeled over on the bench, you knew. They’d bowl blokes over, thump the ball forward, and run in waves. It was exhausting to watch – and write about. God knows what it was like as a player opposing them, halfway through the last quarter of a big game, when your lead had been whittled down, and they were coming hard. Last year, the Tigers were tired, cranky, sore and not very good. There was a new champion side up the road. Martin was no longer the Player of the Colony. Their game against Gold Coast at Docklands, in front of a handful of drunk teenagers, each apparently with their own drum kit, was depressing. Some Richmond supporters wrote about the end of the era like the death of a pet. But others were reluctant to completely write them off. It’s like the press gallery journos who can sniff another Scott Morrison miracle. They’ve been stung before. In 2019, the Tigers were ninth after 14 rounds. So was Morrison. Both he and the Tigers had good timing. Both were indefatigable. Last year however, both were dire. Whenever a great side goes through a rough trot, there’s a rush to frame it as ‘the end’. We’re into the twelfth year of Geelong’s supposed decline. Yet, like the Cats, Richmond present as a team that will stick around, that will nag away, that will reinvent itself on the run. No matter what trends emerge in the game, you suspect Cotchin’s little win on the wing will personify how they want to play. In the next three weeks, Richmond travel to Adelaide and Perth, and square off against the best team in the country on ANZAC eve. Martin is still a chance to return. Prestia, so often their barometer, will get better by the week. Rioli has been reborn as a ferocious tackling, rebounding defender. The Tigers’ young kids are prone to brain fades, but are clearly going to be good footballers. They’re still piecing the puzzle together. They’re not ‘back’, but they’re far from cooked. They’re always dangerous, always compelling, and still very much in the mix.

4/11/2022,"Scott Morrison largely had Queensland to thank for his “miracle” 2019 election, with the party now heading into the 2022 poll holding 23 of the 30 seats in the state, all but one with a margin of under 4%.Many commentators credit the wave of blue to local objections to Bob Brown’s anti-Adani convoy, doubts over Labor’s climate change and tax policies and preference flows from minor parties, namely Pauline Hanson’s One Nation and Clive Palmer’s United Australia party. Labor’s post-2019 election review found the party needed to “find a way to reconnect with Queenslanders” if it is to win the next election and indeed, opposition leader Anthony Albanese has spent significant time in Queensland, including visiting a coalmine. Though there is also a fight on the left – with the Greens looking competitive in several seats. It’s also not yet known what impact Queensland’s newest residents will have on the poll. The state’s population grew by more than 57,800 in 12 months, mostly from Victoria and New South Wales.Here’s what we know about the seats in play: Held by the Labor party with a margin of 0.7%. The seat, in Brisbane’s inner north, has been held by Labor since 1998. Labor’s Anika Wells came within 1,229 votes of losing the seat at the 2019 election, with the party suffering a 5% swing against it after former treasurer Wayne Swan retired. Labor, however, is confident it can improve its margin this time around. Wells, who was Australia’s youngest female MP at 34, is an active member of her community and has been critical of the federal government’s response to the state’s recent floods. She’s up against Liberal candidate Vivian Lobo, who was preselected in late March after the previous candidate withdrew. Held by the Liberal National party with a margin of 3.3%. The seat of Longman, which encompasses the area between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast, is considered a must-hold seat by the Coalition and a must-win for Labor. It has changed hands four times since the 2007 election, most recently in 2019 when the LNP’s Terry Young defeated short-term Labor MP Susan Lamb. The 2022 Labor candidate is Rebecca Fanning, a health policy expert and Caboolture local. Held by the LNP with a margin of 5%. Brisbane was traditionally a Labor seat, until the LNP wrestled it back in 2010 and held it since. But if there’s a swing away from the government, the seat could end up being a three-way contest between the LNP’s Trevor Evans, who has held the seat since 2016, Labor’s Madonna Jarrett and Stephen Bates from the Greens. Support for the Greens in the seat has steadily grown – the party was just two percentage points behind passing Labor and reaching second place in 2019. The ABC’s chief election analyst Antony Green says unless Evans keeps his first-preference percentage in the high 40s, strong flows of preferences could deliver victory to whichever of Labor or the Greens has the higher first-preference vote. Held by the Labor party with a margin of 2.9%. Another three-way contest is likely across the Brisbane River in the seat of Griffth, where Terri Butler will again face Greens candidate Max Chandler-Mather and the LNP’s Olivia Roberts. In 2019, Butler polled almost 10,000 fewer primary votes than her LNP opponent, but a 6.67% swing to the Greens saw her retain the once-safe seat, held by former prime minister Kevin Rudd between 1998 and 2014. The Greens also won the local state seat of South Brisbane in 2020. Held by the LNP with a margin of 14.7%. The Mackay-based electorate of Dawson has been held comfortably since 2010 by retiring Liberal National MP George Christensen, who has made headlines during the pandemic for his conspiracy theory and anti-vaccination commentary. As Guardian Australia wrote last week, ​​the seat explains how complex the state is to navigate politically. The new LNP candidate is Andrew Willcox, his Labor opponent Shane Hamilton. One Nation, which managed to pick up some disaffected Labor voters, also performed strongly in the seat and helped boost the LNP’s margin. Worth watching to see if Labor voters will return to the party this time around.

4/11/2022,"Children’s mental health services in England are overstretched to the point where young people in some areas are waiting up to two years for treatment. A recent survey of GPs by the charity stem4 found that half said most of their referrals of young people for conditions including anxiety and depression are rejected. One child and adolescent mental health service (Camhs) refused to take on a boy found with a ligature in his room because the fact that he had no marks on his neck meant that he did not meet the threshold for treatment. Figures obtained via a freedom of information request show average waiting times for autism referrals of a year-and-a-half at Coventry and Warwickshire NHS trust, with one child kept waiting for five years. Perhaps the range of mental health conditions, and the fact that so many people experience symptoms or episodes over their lifetimes, help to explain how these services have been allowed to deteriorate to the point that they have done without a louder public outcry – or closer scrutiny of what is going on. Attention to healthcare has understandably been focused principally on hospitals and Covid over the past two years. The NHS across the UK is understood to be facing an unprecedented crisis of unmeetable demand. But a decade after a Conservative-led government made the promise that mental illness would have “parity of esteem” with physical illness, it is hugely dismaying that nothing seems further from the truth. “It is so appalling in our area it may as well not exist” was one GP’s description of a Yorkshire Camhs. Mental illness should be treated in people of all ages. But children waiting such long periods should concern us particularly, given the emotional and educational significance of childhood. The impact of domestic violence and parental mental illness remain the most frequent reasons for children being referred to councils’ specialist services. The danger now is that rising poverty levels, as energy and other prices rise while benefits have been cut, will only exacerbate such needs. Already, government statistics show a 25% increase in the number of young people with a mental health need – from 61,830 in 2019 to 77,390 last year. Cuts imposed under austerity led to reductions in the number of highly skilled staff. While funding has since increased, the early intervention and community programmes that were removed have not been adequately replaced. Camhs staff report that nearly all their time is spent on identifying problems and managing risks – and almost none on delivering the treatments for which they were trained. Huge regional variations in spending are the result of the different priority accorded to young people’s mental health by clinical commissioning groups, whose decision-making is often opaque. Short-term initiatives too often take the place of sustained investment, including in staff. The narrative of Covid’s impact on children is unfinished, and in parts contradictory. There is no doubt that damage has been caused, with widespread reports of anxiety and developmental difficulties. But deciding at what point a child’s unhappiness should be classed as a problem requiring professional help is not always straightforward. And there are multiple other factors, with rising concerns around the impact of social media use, particularly on teenage girls with their susceptibility to eating disorders, predating the pandemic. Young refugees, including those arriving from Ukraine, are another group needing support. Mental illness remains a complex and contested area. Social determinants affect all aspects of our health, but the impact on mental health of poor housing and low incomes is clear. Strengthened children’s services and ringfenced funding should form part of the forthcoming mental health strategy. New protections in the online safety bill should be introduced as quickly as possible. But as long as the government rejects policies that would lift millions of families out of poverty, it is hard to see the outlook for the most vulnerable young people improving.",News/Society,The Guardian view on Camhs in crisis: young people need more help | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/10/the-guardian-view-on-camhs-in-crisis-young-people-need-more-help
4/11/2022,"Unless one is fortunate enough to be amongst that pure group of supporters whose mood is governed entirely by their team winning or losing, in the same binary way that the tides are dictated by the moon, then at some point watching the Matildas clash with New Zealand, all you could do was laugh. It wasn’t humorous in the traditional sense. There were no slapstick collisions or misunderstandings. Lydia Williams didn’t decide to take advantage of the almost complete absence of threat to her goal by giving the crowd at North Queensland Stadium 15 minutes of stand up. Instead, it was amusing in the most perfect, absurdist manner. Your best-laid plans are folly and there are no rules or logic to the football universe. By all measures of statistical analysis or logic, the Matildas should never have had to rely upon late, late goals from Emily van Egmond and Sam Kerr to secure what was a dramatic come-from-behind 2-1 win over the Football Ferns. Australia’s women had 71% of the ball. They sent in 37 shots to three, with the on-target count an even more farcical 15 to one in favour of the hosts. Outside of Anna Green’s 32nd-minute Puskás Award contender, the Kiwis offered nothing in attack. And yet despite all this, in defiance of the gilt-edged chances that fell to the Australians, as normal time expired Green’s worldie remained the only goal. Australia hit the woodwork. They mishit shots on a largely open goal. They fired shots just wide. They were blocked away by Claudia Bunge or Meikayla Moore or denied by another Victoria Esson save. And most of all, they did not score. It was football’s version of an absurdist comedy; the footballing gods seeing how far they could push the joke before reality collapsed in on itself and sucked North Queensland into a black hole. Against this darkly humorous backdrop, a macabre sense of irony began to form around Matildas’ coach Tony Gustavsson. The week prior he had sought to re-write history by declaring that multiple analyses of his side’s disastrous 1-0 loss to South Korea at the Asian Cup showed the Matildas should have won that game, ignoring how the Koreans largely outplayed his side in the moments that mattered. But on Friday, he watched on powerlessly as his side put in arguably their most functional and effective performance under his charge, only to find themselves on the wrong end of a deficit. And after exhausting significant goodwill by failing to demonstrate an improvement in execution or results when the switch was flipped to “performance mode” in India, significant pressure was inevitable despite the underlying positivity. That’s why when Kerr charged through a pack like a ponytailed freight train and headed Australia into the lead in the 96th minute all one could do was laugh. In the cruellest way possible, the New Zealanders found out that eventually sheer weight of numbers will win out in a game of football. As Australia’s greatest-ever goalscorer wheeled away in celebration, all the angst that had swirled over the heads of those in the Matildas dugout vanished. And for all the declarations from the commentariat on how Australian football needed to stop defining itself by effort, grit and emotion, they were hoisted on its own petard as the ‘never say die’ attitude of the Matildas won the day. Nonetheless, good comedy always contains within it a grain of truth. And if there is any moment from the Matildas’ performance on Friday that represents the truth, it was Katrina Gorry’s performance at the base of the midfield. The most prevalent role of a deep-lying midfielder in Australian football is that of a screener that provides extra defensive cover. Gorry’s role resembled more that of a regista: a creative force whose deeper position in front of the defence allows them to pull the strings and dictate the ebb and flow of their side in attack. In Italian, regista translates to ‘director’, and that’s exactly what Gorry did throughout the contest. The Brisbane Roar midfielder was a revelation in giving the Australian midfield a hitherto unseen level of functionality and composure during extended periods of possession. Of course, despite the win, it was far from a perfect performance from the Australians. The level of resistance provided by New Zealand adds further qualifiers to the performance – Spain, the United States, and England will bring far more heat. But there were positives to build upon. After the disaster of the Asian Cup, Gorry’s presence showed the Matildas are capable of doing more with the ball. While at some point they might run into a European-shaped brick wall, it was a performance that showed the Australians do possess a ceiling greater than the one demonstrated thus far under Gustavsson. Now to see if they can build on it… or if the joke is on us. ",Sport/Football,Laugh? We almost cried.

4/11/2022,"The Russian general appointed by Vladimir Putin to lead efforts to reboot the invasion of Ukraine played a prominent role in the Syrian war, where forces under his command were responsible for widespread abuses against the civilian population and were frequently accused of committing crimes against humanity. Gen Aleksandr Dvornikov, 60, has been described as an “old school” general and a “blood and soil nationalist”, trained in Soviet military doctrines that view obliterating civilian targets as a means of gaining battlefield momentum. A career military officer, he has risen steadily through the ranks since starting as a platoon commander in 1982. He fought during the second war in Chechnya and took several top positions before being placed in charge of the Russian troops in Syria. Dvornikov was dispatched by Putin in September 2015 on an urgent mission to stabilise the position of the Syrian regime forces, who Tehran and Moscow believed were on the brink of falling to the opposition. The decision to establish new battlefield leadership in Ukraine comes as Russia gears up for what is expected to be a large and more focused push to expand Russian control in the Donbas region, and follows a failed opening attempt to conquer Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. In Syria, Dvornikov quickly established an airbase near the north-west coast, from where bombers obliterated towns and cities across Idlib province. The fall of Syria’s second city, Aleppo, was substantially due to Russian airstrikes, which were flown from the Hmeimim base and routinely targeted hospitals, schools, bread queues and other pillars of civilian life. The anti-aircraft batteries he installed gave Russian and Syrian jets air supremacy over Idlib, and destructive bombing runs have been carried out with impunity over the past five years. Several of the fighter pilots who took part in the Syrian war have been shot down over Ukraine. Dvornikov was also responsible for the Russian campaign against Islamic State in Syria’s east. Russian propaganda efforts attempted to conflate the two conflicts, claiming they were fighting the same enemy on both sides of the country. Putin’s intervention in Syria was on the pretext of fighting terrorists who were besieging the country. However, Russia’s first airstrikes did not target IS or a second jihadi group, Jabhat al-Nusra, then active in Idlib. Rather, they struck opposition groups whose attacks on Syrian armour columns had seriously weakened Bashar al-Assad’s hold on the Alawite heartland and, by extension Damascus. The Russian offensive turned the tide of the war in favour of Assad. The war of narrative also partially tipped towards the Syrian leader, with far less scrutiny cast over Russian denials that it was targeting civilian infrastructure as a means of terrorising populations into submission, and sympathy in many quarters for the two leaders’ claims that the fight against Assad was led by jihadists as opposed to insurrectionists. Russia’s Syrian campaign was viewed by Putin as a success, and he awarded Dvornikov the hero of Russia medal, one of the country’s highest awards. Russia lost very few troops or aircraft in the conflict and was able to maintain air supremacy throughout. Dvornikov, who has served as commander of the southern military district since 2016, faces a very different set of challenges in Ukraine, where the Russian air force does not control the skies and its ground forces have been seriously depleted by regular supplies of advanced weaponry that was unavailable to Syrian rebels. Just as formidable will be countering the enormous amount of data coming out of the war zone that disproves Russia’s claims of battlefield success. While Syria was regarded as the best-chronicled conflict of modern times, that effort is dwarfed by the way smartphones and digital technology have brought the Ukraine conflict to the world.",News/World news,Aleksandr Dvornikov: Russian general who helped turn tide of Syrian war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/10/alexander-dvornikov-russian-general-who-helped-turn-tide-of-syrian-war
