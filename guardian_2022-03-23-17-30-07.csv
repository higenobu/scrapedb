3/23/2022,"A rubber penis that health workers are using as part of a family planning kit to demonstrate how to put on a condom has sparked anger in rural India, where sex remains a taboo subject. Some members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) have demanded that the kits be withdrawn and an apology offered to the health workers. One BJP state legislator, Chitra Kishor Wagh, said the Maharashtra government, which introduced the kit, “has lost its mind”. His colleague, Akash Bhundkar, wanted the government to apologise to the health workers for the “embarrassment” it had caused them. One role of rural health workers is to educate villagers about family planning and contraception. To make it easier to explain the mechanics of it, 25,000 new kits have been distributed in Maharashtra containing a rubber penis and a uterus, to replace the earlier booklets. The uterus has evoked no reaction but the penis has become a lightning rod for criticism, where such overt symbols are shocking to rural Indians. Dr Archana Patil, director of Maharashtra’s public health department, told local media that such aids were important for health workers to be able to get the message across. However, the health workers themselves are from the same rural background and may feel acutely uncomfortable using the prop, leading some family planning experts to wonder if the effort might backfire. Poonam Muttreja, director of the Population Foundation of India, said the reaction to the phallus would simply strengthen the voices of traditionalists who oppose sex education in villages and schools. “This is highly culturally insensitive and inappropriate. It puts the health workers in a very awkward position. This happened two decades ago when an international agency produced very explicit material for sex education. There is plenty of culturally appropriate material in use that is more effective,” she said. India’s top sex therapist, Dr Mahinder Watsa, who died in 2020, used to say that many of his patients were couples who sought his help over their inability to conceive. A brief chat used to reveal that ignorance of human anatomy meant they were not doing it the right way.",News/World news,Backlash in rural India over rubber penis in family planning kit,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/backlash-india-rubber-penis-family-planning-kit
3/23/2022,"Is truth the first casualty of pandemics? Of all the deplorable claims made about Covid, for me the most brazen was one of the earliest, in April 2020, by Boris Johnson. He said we “succeeded in the first and most important task”, because “at no stage has our NHS been overwhelmed. No patient went without a ventilator. No patient was deprived of intensive care … We avoided an uncontrollable and catastrophic epidemic.” When the prime minister uttered those extraordinary words, immediately after his own hospitalisation with Covid, I nearly choked in disbelief. Our death toll that day had reached 26,771. It was a dizzying number, too vast to comprehend. You grope for analogies to anchor such losses in your mind. This was like 60 jumbo jets full of human beings, each packed to capacity, falling from the sky. The insensitivity of attempting to spin as “success” such manifest horror took my breath away. The truth is, Covid caused a collapse of healthcare as we know it – in both the first and subsequent waves. The NHS was overwhelmed. Two years on, so much rewriting of history has happened, it is easy to forget just how anarchic and desperate conditions were inside our hospitals in early 2020. NHS staff threw everything they had at increasing ICU capacity, but England’s starting point was only 4,000 critical care beds – one of the lowest numbers per head of any country in Europe. Horrified by the images from China and Italy, frontline staff like me implored the government to lock down. Yet hospitals were literally beginning to run out of oxygen before Johnson finally decided to act. The service did not cope so much as shut down. In the frantic scramble to claw together as many ventilated beds as possible, surgical procedures in their thousands were cancelled. Cancers were left undiagnosed. Vulnerable patients dug in at home, too fearful or obedient to present to hospital. Staff couldn’t get tested for Covid. The PPE shortages were real and deadly. As for that “protective ring” Matt Hancock would later try to claim he threw around care homes, it was pure fiction. We all know what really happened to care home residents. Ignored and overlooked, they died in their thousands, not so much “cocooned” – as the government claimed – but incarcerated with Covid. It serves many people politically to try to rewrite the grim realities of the pandemic as they actually unfolded inside the NHS. If anything, the attempts to spin, erase and deny the lived experience of health and care workers are more concerted now than ever. The mythologising of NHS “heroes” has been replaced by a pernicious new narrative, seductive to those of a libertarian bent, that lockdowns were draconian blunders – a panicky overreaction that must never be repeated. Last month, for example, the Telegraph published a piece by Fraser Nelson dramatically entitled: “Our liberty rests on whether Sage will admit to its horrendous lockdown mistakes.” This could not be more wrong. Certainly lockdowns were a last resort, to be avoided if at all possible. But had we not locked down two years ago today, and again in January 2021, we would have seen corpses in hospital car parks, much like those harrowing images of Covid tents springing up outside hospitals in New York. Even as it was, there were too few ambulances, ventilators and critical care beds to go round. Patients died in corridors, they died in waiting rooms, they even died in hospital toilets. They died at home, alone, waiting for overwhelmed paramedics who couldn’t get there in time. I write these facts not to shock but to urge reflection. It may be politically convenient for the government to embrace the “end” of the pandemic, for example – ending free testing, tracing and the requirement to self-isolate – but 11,000 hospital beds in England remain occupied by patients with Covid. Staff morale, meanwhile, has never been lower. A record number of more than 400 employees in NHS England are quitting their jobs every week. One NHS intensive care consultant recently tweeted: “We started the pandemic with 17 ICU consultants. Over the last 24 months, two have retired, one has resigned, one is on long-term sabbatical, three have been off for long periods with stress – all needed psych support.” Clearly there isn’t a hope of reducing the 6.2 million-strong waiting list in England with staff attrition like that. The bottom line is that the NHS is not coping much better now than it was at Covid’s peaks. We are drowning – in Covid patients, cancer patients, the patients on the waiting list backlogs, and the patients whose conditions have become infinitely more complex and harmful because they’ve been waiting so long. There are so few staff – and those left are so burned out and traumatised – that patients are inevitably being neglected. Oddly, NHS England seems to be following Sajid Javid’s lead in remaining silent about this. So much for NHS candour. If patients matter, then being candid about Covid matters. The government must first be honest about the crisis conditions inside the NHS, and then commit to resourcing an urgent and long-term expansion of frontline staff, future-proofing the NHS against new waves of Covid. False narratives about the NHS “coping” are unhelpful and damaging. Is it any wonder our morale is at rock bottom when our lived experience – the world we inhabit daily – is sanitised, airbrushed and erased, and our political leaders – and much of the media – seem determined to ignore it and “move on”?

3/23/2022,"Such is Brennan Johnson’s glittering form for Nottingham Forest, Austria would be foolish to fixate on the usual suspects when they take on Wales in their World Cup play-off semi-final. Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey are the obvious stars but in Johnson Wales possess another jewel. Last Sunday a familiar scene unfolded as Liverpool became the latest team to witness what the fuss is about, as the 20-year-old tormented Jürgen Klopp’s side with his searing pace, tenacity and eye for a killer pass during a testing FA Cup quarter-final. Johnson shone earlier in the competition against Leicester and Arsenal, scoring against the former when he nutmegged the Wales goalkeeper Danny Ward from an acute angle. “He is so composed,” says Paul Bodin, who worked with Johnson when in charge of Wales’s Under‑19s and later with the Under‑21s. “He can pass it with good quality when he’s running. He just feeds the ball into good areas, with the perfect weight of pass … They were standout things years ago but they were not on the stage he is on now. I’m sure he will go on to do it for Wales for many years.” Johnson scored three minutes into his Under-21s debut against Belgium and Bodin knew instantly he would not hang around his squad for long. Even now, there is a sense Johnson is only beginning to fulfil his potential. “A couple of years ago, I don’t think he perhaps believed how good he was,” Bodin says. “With young players, you try to keep them on a nice calm level and I think Brennan kind of stayed on that level rather than thinking: ‘Hang on, I’m a lot a better than all of these players around me and I can reach for the stars.’ He has had good management at Forest under Steve Cooper, who is used to dealing with good young players, and he has flourished again. He’s got all the ingredients, he’s got the right attitude, he’s got great family support, so the world is his oyster.” His performances this season have cemented his status as the most exciting talent in the Football League. Brentford had four bids rejected in January and are not the only Premier League team trailing the forward, who joined Forest aged eight. Born in Nottingham, he played for England Under-16s and Under-17s but qualifies for Wales through grandparents from Powys and is set to build on his seven caps in Cardiff on Thursday. Questions about his discipline off the ball have been answered, helped by a stint in central midfield as a 16-year-old to make sure he tracked runners. “Gary Brazil [Forest’s academy manager] has developed him in a great way,” says the interim Wales manager, Robert Page. Those who have worked with Johnson say the same thing about his character. “He is a genuine, quiet, modest man,” Bodin says. “But once he is unleashed on to the pitch, he is a different animal.” It seems inevitable that Johnson will be in the top flight next season – ideally with Forest. He set the tone on the opening day at Coventry last August, picking up possession on the half-turn inside his own half before tearing down the right and putting the ball on a plate for Lyle Taylor on the edge of the six-yard box. “I thought: ‘He’s arrived,’” says Bodin. A few weeks later Johnson smacked in his first Forest goal to equalise at Derby and he has since eased into double figures. It was a similar story on loan last season at Lincoln City, for whom Johnson thrived after a debut cameo off the bench. “In those 20 minutes you knew immediately what kind of impact he was going to have on us as a group,” says Lincoln’s head coach, Michael Appleton, who played with Johnson’s father, David, at Manchester United. “The following game, against Blackpool, he started and won two penalties.” Johnson is unpredictable, durable and lightning quick. “It’s one thing having pace but it is another thing knowing how to use it,” says Appleton. “When Brennan gets the ball, he always looks to turn and get forward. He never really passes up responsibility. A lot of young players now want everything to feet – not enough are prepared to run in behind but Brennan was prepared to do that, which I liked. I think I played Brennan in six positions. He just got on with it and was very comfortable. I think he will naturally end up as more of a No 9, because he is prepared to run without the ball and if he does that in more central areas he will probably get even more goals.” Johnson sparkled for Lincoln en route to the League One play‑off final last May, the day Wales announced their Euro 2020 squad. Johnson was, Bodin says, a hairline from making the cut when Rubin Colwill, who was free to impress at a Wales training camp that month, was a surprise pick. Regardless, Johnson, who made his first competitive Wales start alongside Colwill in the crucial World Cup qualifying victory against Belarus in September, is primed to thrive. The hard part will be deciding where he plays, with Bale at home on the right, where Johnson has predominantly featured for Forest. Wales are set to revert to operating with a false No 9 with Kieffer Moore injured. “Gareth has been an absolute legend for his country but he knows he’s got somebody young in Brennan who is snapping at his heels and is wanting that jersey,” Page says.",Sport/Football,‘He’s got all the ingredients’: Brennan Johnson can be new star for Wales | Ben Fisher,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/23/brennan-johnson-wales-world-cup-nottingham-forest
3/23/2022,"At the time of writing, Nightmare Alley is the longest of long shots for the Academy Award: it’s the complete outsider at the bookies, and absolutely no one is tipping it. But just because it won’t win the best picture Oscar doesn’t mean it shouldn’t. It’s a big, brash picture in the old style, stuffed with heavyweight performers oozing class, and put together with seemingly effortless aplomb by director Guillermo del Toro – who of course has pedigree at this level, having won this very award in 2018 with The Shape of Water. Now, The Shape of Water was admittedly a bit lucky to win ahead of Dunkirk, Phantom Thread and Get Out, but perhaps its eccentricity and Creature from the Black Lagoon references made it distinctive. Certainly, Nightmare Alley is a less obviously odd film, but like The Shape of Water, it has its roots in Hollywood’s pulp past; a remake of a 1947 Tyrone Power film noir, one of the freaky bizarro kind of noirs, as opposed to the tightlipped hat-and-gun type, or hapless patsy head-over-heels in love type. Noir hasn’t been part of the serious Oscar conversation for years: while the definition is pretty elastic and some might argue for Joker, the last contender was probably LA Confidential in the mid-90s. So we can be grateful to Del Toro for this, if nothing else. But Nightmare Alley is a lot more than an expensively dressed genre exercise: it’s one of those films whose undeniably brilliant acting raises it to a level it might not have achieved otherwise. Sometimes you wonder what exactly it is that Bradley Cooper is good for, but the answer is right here: behind the vanilla, down-home charm is an performer of astute intelligence, who gives his role of Stan Carlisle, a fairground scammer who tries and fails for the big con, a genuinely tragic dimension. Blandly handsome American leading men get called the new Gary Cooper fairly regularly, but Cooper may have more in common with his predecessor than just a surname. It’s also fortunate that Del Toro has Cate Blanchett on hand, as the slinky analyst who underwrites Carlisle’s fake medium play by feeding him information about the wealthy types who hire him for readings. In the hands of a lesser actor the role might not be much to write home about, but as with everything Blanchett does, it’s supercharged. The same is true of Rooney Mara, who has what would normally be a pretty thankless task as Carlisle’s increasingly put-upon wife; the fact that Del Toro can install someone of her calibre gives every corner of the film heft. Willem Dafoe, conversely, is pretty much on home ground as the geek-show operator: his lecture to Carlisle on how he snags his geeks is a masterclass in matter-of-fact nastiness. In another time, Nightmare Alley would have a proper shot at the big prize, but even so it’s bit of a mystery that none of its stars are nominated for any of the acting awards. Presumably it’s just too early in the noir-revival cycle we can only hope is on its way.",Arts/Film,Why Nightmare Alley should win the best picture Oscar,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/23/why-nightmare-alley-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar
3/23/2022,"It didn’t take long for lockdown to be reframed as the chance to finally produce that creative masterpiece you’ve been sitting on: after all, Shakespeare wrote King Lear during the plague, so what’s your excuse? Patti Smith – as ever – did something more interesting with her time, focusing not on one singular work but an opportunity to let her wild creativity roam while she shielded with a bronchial condition. In April 2021, Smith launched a Substack newsletter to share her poetry, music and thoughts. It quickly inspired The Melting, a longer, serialised work (now at 45 parts and counting) that started as her private pandemic journal before undergoing a glorious multimedia mutation that blurs fact and fiction. “I was already looking to get out of my skin and move into another dimension,” she told Esquire. From her inimitable evocations of lockdown claustrophobia, a “parallel”, multidimensional world emerged, in which Smith embarks on a path of discovery that draws in science-fiction, warnings about the climate crisis and dealings with the defunct Continental Drift Club that may be familiar to readers of M Train. “The reader is my notebook,” says Smith, who credits her Substack with reinventing her process of creating and publishing – a bold and thrilling assertion from an artist who has never trodden a conventional creative path, from those early days in New York City’s nascent punk scene, to collaborations with her partner Robert Mapplethorpe; taking early semi-retirement to raise her family and gloriously re-emerging as one of the greatest live performers of her generation. Latterly, she has made her name all over again as a powerful and inventive memoirist with Just Kids, M Train and Year of the Monkey – and autumn will bring a new photographic publication, A Book of Days, collecting “a year of reflections and images, inspired by my Instagram, but original throughout … The fruit of much labor, populated by sacred ghosts, and celebrating the new.” You can ask Smith about all of this, and anything else from her fantastically sprawling history, when she sits for the Guardian’s reader interview.

3/23/2022,"The UK has struck a deal with the US to remove tariffs on British steel exports, ending months of tensions that had stood in the way of a broader bilateral trade agreement. The agreement was struck after UK’s international trade minister, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, met her counterpart, the US commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, on Tuesday evening in Baltimore, Maryland. In a joint statement, Raimondo and the US trade representative Katherine Tai said the deal would protect steel and aluminium companies – and their workers – in both countries, allowing the allies to focus on what they say are “China’s unfair trade practices”. The would also help ease inflation in the US, where consumer prices have hit their highest level in 40 years, Raimondo said. British steel and aluminium companies that export to the US have faced tariffs of 25% and 10% respectively on their goods since 2018, when they were brought in by the then president Donald Trump. The UK retaliated with equivalent levies on prominent American products such as Levi’s jeans, bourbon whiskey and Harley Davidson motorbikes. The US section 232 tariffs were introduced under “national security” concerns and were part of Trump’s broader efforts to put pressure on trading partners. The UK steel industry reacted with alarm when the US agreed a deal with the EU to remove the Trump-era tariffs on European steel at the end of 2021, leaving British businesses at a disadvantage for months. Under the new deal, Britain will receive a duty-free import quota of more than 500,000 tonnes of steel “melted and poured” in the country annually, with higher volumes subject to the 25% tariff. It also sets smelt and cast requirements on aluminium, requiring importers to certify the origin of raw aluminium used, a move to combat subsidised metal from China and other countries. The agreement requires any UK steel company owned by a Chinese entity to audit their financial records to assess influence from the Chinese government, and then share them with the US. The requirement will initially apply to British Steel, acquired by China’s Jingye Group in 2020. The pact will end Britain’s retaliatory tariffs on American goods. Alasdair McDiarmid, operations director for the steelworkers’ union Community, said: “The news the US steel tariffs are being lifted is welcome, though we need to understand the full detail of the agreement. “To protect jobs our steelmakers must compete on a level playing field, and it is vital the UK does not suffer a further competitive disadvantage with EU producers. The EU secured their deal with the US back in October, so a UK-US deal is well overdue, and it must be implemented without delay to prevent further damage to our industry.” Steel companies and other heavy industrial users of large amounts of energy have also repeatedly called for help with energy prices, which were causing problems even before the recent increase in global energy prices – worsened by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – which is threatening to knock the global economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. However, the Treasury and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, have previously resisted calls for more support for industry. Sunak is thought to be preparing action aimed at the consumer cost-of-living crisis in Wednesday’s spring statement, which would likely limit the government’s appetite for large-scale support for industry. McDiarmid said: “Britain’s steel industry is under huge pressure, and steelworkers are looking to the chancellor to take action to cut our unaffordable electricity prices.”",News/Business,Britain agrees deal with US to end tariffs on steel exports,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/22/britain-closes-in-on-deal-with-us-to-end-tariffs-on-steel-exports
