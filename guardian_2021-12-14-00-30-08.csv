12/14/2021,"My friend Jacky Flurscheim, who has died aged 81, was the poetry editor at Oxford University Press from 1976 until 1998, when, to her grief and fury, the list was unceremoniously closed. For many years she also ran the Thomas Tallis Society in Greenwich, south-east London. Born in Altrincham, outside Manchester, Jacky was the elder daughter of Honor (nee Platt) and Charles Flurscheim, an electro-mechanical engineer with AEI (Associated Eletrical Industries). She went as a boarder to St Felix school in Suffolk, a county for which she retained a lasting affection, later spending idyllic times in a cottage on the marshes near Blythburgh. At school she flourished, playing the piano and directing plays.  After a year at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London, followed by a year at the Sorbonne in Paris, she got her first taste of publishing with a job as an editorial assistant at Thames and Hudson, which fostered both attention to detail and her love of words, as she checked each individually pasted-up page. In 1964 she married Philip Simms, a professional musician and organist at St Alfege Church, Greenwich. Together they launched the Thomas Tallis Society, named after another (rather more famous) organist of that parish. For years Jacky organised concerts, fixed overseas tours, and threw post-concert parties. Somehow she also found time to become a mother, to complete an English literature degree at what is now Goldsmiths, University of London, and to write and publish a novel, Unsolicited Gift (1982). In 1976 she inherited responsibility for Oxford University Press’s poetry list from the academic and poet Jon Stallworthy. For the next 20 years Jacky oversaw publication of one of the most distinguished poetry lists in the UK, nurturing the poets who became her friends. It was a job she loved and for which she was greatly admired. In 1998, however, OUP decided to axe the list. She told the Independent newspaper: “It’s an act of vandalism … you can’t sell the whole list like a sack of potatoes.” Despite loud support from John Carey, Hermione Lee, Craig Raine and many others, OUP was adamant – the list was to go and 26 poets had to find new publishers. There followed some unsettling times when her marriage came to an end, but after a year teaching English literature in Japan, Jacky moved into a beautiful flat in Blackheath and became an active grandmother to two boys, one of whom was a chorister at Temple Church in central London, a place she loved and which gave full expression to her delight in music and poetry. Jacky is survived by her son, Ben, two grandsons, Jake and Oscar, and her sister, Liz.",Arts/Books,Jacky Flurscheim obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/13/jacky-flurscheim-obituary
12/14/2021,"You wake up with a pounding head, sore throat and runny nose: you reach for one of those lateral flow tests (LFT) you’ve got stashed away, just to check it is not Covid. If it returns a single red line (negative), then most people will pop a couple of paracetamol and go about business as normal – particularly if you’ve been double-jabbed. It probably is just a cold, after all. Yet, the emergence of Omicron has thrown a spanner in the works. According to the latest data, just one month after your second Pfizer or AstraZeneca jab, the ability of antibodies to neutralise Omicron is 30 times lower than if you were infected with the Delta variant – reinforcing the message that double-vaccination is no guarantee against infection.  The study follows recent UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) data, suggesting those who have been double-jabbed with the AstraZeneca vaccine have about 10% protection against symptomatic infection with Omicron six months after their second jab, compared with 40% protection against the Delta variant. So, if you’re relying on a LFT to guide whether or not it is safe for you to leave the house, the odds of it being wrong just got higher. The UK government has always stressed that people with Covid symptoms should seek a PCR test, rather than relying on a LFT. Yet, it still defines these symptoms as a high temperature, new, continuous cough and/or a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste – despite widespread evidence that headaches, fatigue, a sore throat or runny nose are also common Covid symptoms. Also, whereas getting a PCR test involves all the trouble of going online, booking a test, either going to a test centre or waiting to have a test delivered, and then waiting a day or two to receive the test results, a LFT delivers a result within minutes. OK, we know they’re not as accurate as PCR tests, but they’re pretty accurate – especially if you’ve been vaccinated and/or had Covid recently – right? It is true that lateral flow tests return an accurate result more often than not: a Cochrane review of 64 studies found that they correctly identify 72% of infected people who have symptoms, and 78% within the first week of becoming ill. Further, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) claims that the Innova LFT detects more than 95% of individuals with highest viral loads – those who are most likely to spread the virus. Yet, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), has long-expressed concerns that people may be falsely reassured if they test negative on an LFT: it authorised their use as a “red light” – to find infectious people and order them to self-isolate – rather than providing a “green light” to those who test negative. There are several reasons why your negative LFT might be wrong: you might not be swabbing thoroughly enough, or you could have a dodgy test kit. Of course, these issues can also undermine the accuracy of PCR tests – remember the Wolverhampton testing lab fiasco, that saw up to 43,000 people falsely reassured that they didn’t have Covid, despite many of them testing positive on a LFT? Yet, PCR tests are more sensitive than LFT, meaning they’re more likely to register some virus, even if your swabbing technique isn’t much cop. They’re also much more likely to return a positive result during the early stages of infection, when there’s less virus available to detect. Studies have suggested that PCR tests start to pick up Sars-CoV-2 roughly 1-3 days before the onset of symptoms (assuming the person is symptomatic) – similar to when people start to become infectious. However, virus levels don’t peak until between the first and fifth day of symptoms, on average. So, if you’re swabbing as soon as you start to feel unwell, that might be too soon to return a positive LFT. These tests have thankfully freed us from the confines for that first lockdown, when the advice was to self-isolate based on symptoms alone. But with infection levels sky high, Covid symptoms that too often resemble the common cold, and waning immunity from vaccines, perhaps it’s time to reinstate a degree of caution and stay home if we feel unwell – at least until we’ve done a PCR test, or had several days of negative LFTs.

United detected the cases via lateral flow tests after Saturday’s 1-0 win at Norwich City and training on Monday was cancelled in light of PCR test confirmation.  A club statement said: “The decision has been taken to close down first-team operations at the Carrington training complex for 24 hours, to minimise risk of any further infection. Individuals who tested positive are isolating per Premier League protocols. “Given cancellation of training and disruption to the squad, and with the health of players and staff the priority, the club is in discussion with the Premier League whether it is safe for Tuesday’s fixture against Brentford to continue, both from a Covid infection and player preparation perspective. Team and staff travel to London will be deferred pending the result of that discussion.” Tottenham’s games with Rennes and Brighton were postponed because of Covid, and Leicester had several players unavailable for Sunday’s match at Newcastle because of the virus. When Spurs closed the first-team area of their training ground last Wednesday after discussions with the Health Security Agency (formerly Public Health England) and Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport advisers, the next steps were the postponements of their Europa Conference League home tie against Rennes on Thursday and the Premier League visit to Brighton on Sunday.

12/14/2021,"In one of the more unexpected comebacks of the year, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association has announced the nominations for its 79th awards ceremony, to be held on 9 January – but not screened on television after broadcaster NBC terminated the contract. Belfast, Kenneth Branagh’s black-and-white drama set in his hometown during the Troubles, has seven nominations, as does The Power of the Dog, Jane Campion’s sexually-charged western set in 1920s Montana.  Branagh and Campion both vy for best director and best screenplay, while their films are up for best drama. Benedict Cumberbatch is nominated for best leading actor for his role as an aggressive cattle rancher in Campion’s film, while his co-star, Kodi Smit-McPhee, is up for best supporting actor alongside Belfast’s Ciaran Hinds and Jamie Dornan. In the supporting actress category, Kirsten Dunst represents Campion’s film, while Caitriona Balfe is there for Belfast. Jonny Greenwood’s score completes The Power of the Dog’s nominations, while Van Morrison’s Down to Joy gives Belfast a shot at best original song. Don’t Look Up, Adam McKay’s apocalypse satire, which opened to mixed reviews over the weekend, picked up four nominations, for best comedy or musical, McKay’s screenplay and for its stars, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence. Steven Spielberg’s remake of West Side Story also took four, as did King Richard, in which Will Smith plays the father of Venus and Serena Williams. Cooper Hoffman, the 18-year-old son of Philip Seymour Hoffman, is up for best actor in a comedy or musical for his debut screen role in Paul Thomas Anderson’s coming-of-age comedy, Licorice Pizza. The musician Alana Haim, another first-timer who stars alongside Hoffman in the film, is up for the equivalent actress category; Anderson’s screenplay is also nominated, and the film is up for best musical or comedy. Olivia Colman, who won the actress in a musical or comedy award in 2019 for The Favourite, is this year in contention for best actress in a drama, for Maggie Gyllenhaal’s adaptation of the Elena Ferrante novel The Lost Daughter. She competes against Kirsten Stewart, who plays Princess Diana in Spencer, Jessica Chastain for televangelist tragedy The Eyes of Tammy Faye, Nicole Kidman as Lucille Ball in Being the Ricardos and Lady Gaga in Ridley Scott’s true crime hit, House of Gaga. Andrew Garfield is nominated for best actor in a comedy or musical as Rent creator Jonathan Larson in tick, tick … Boom!, while fellow Brit Ruth Negga is up for best supporting actress for her role in Rebecca Hall’s Passing. Succession is scorecard leader in the TV categories, with nominations for best drama series as well as stars Brian Cox, Jeremy Strong, Kieran Culkin and Sarah Snook. Nods for Jennifer Aniston and Billy Crudup helped The Morning Show to four nominations, a number also achieved by Ted Lasso. Squid Game’s three nominations ensured Netflix retained its position as by far the strongest studio at this stage; the outfit is also behind The Power of the Dog and Don’t Look Up. It achieved 12 nominations more than its closest competitor. The list was announced on Monday by Snoop Dogg and newly appointed HFPA president Helen Hoehne. In her opening address Hoehne made reference to her organisation’s tumultuous year and some eight months of attempting “to be better”. The HFPA has long been tainted by accusations of scandal and corruption but in February 2021 an investigation by the Los Angeles Times revealed an organisation plagued by infightingand also revealed that not one of the 87 members, hailing from around 55 countries, was Black. The lack of diversity looked likely to be the final straw for the beleaguered body, particularly viewed in contrast to the organisations which decide the Oscars and Baftas, whose efforts to increase diversity have led to their numbers recently swelling to almost 10,000 and 6,500, respectively. Hollywood publicists cut ties with the HFPA shortly after the investigation was published, as did broadcasters, including NBC, who had long screened the event. Tom Cruise returned his three trophies and numerous stars vowed to boycott proceedings until substantial change was made. The HFPA responded by attempting to fast-track an overhaul, appointing Hoehne, as well as a law firm to look into corruption allegations, rewriting its rules and charter and changing its board of governors. In April, they expelled former president Philip Berk from the organisation after her circulated an article to fellow members calling Black Lives Matter a “racist hate movement”. In October they announced the appointment of 21 new members, primarily Black, and the intention of adding a further 30 within the next 18 months.",Arts/Film,Golden Globe nominations 2022: Belfast and The Power of the Dog lead the pack ,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/13/golden-globe-nominations-2021-belfast-and-the-power-of-the-dog-lead-the-pack
12/14/2021,"Powerful tornadoes barrelled through five US states on Friday, levelling houses and factories and bringing down power lines. In Kentucky, the worst-hit state, one tornado alone followed an extraordinarily long and destructive path of more than 200 miles.  Authorities are still tallying the devastation, and the death toll has not been confirmed, but Kentucky’s governor, Andy Beshear, estimated on Monday that at least 64 people had died there with dozens more unaccounted for. At least six people have been killed in Illinois, four in Tennessee, two in Arkansas and two in Missouri. One of the hardest hit towns was Mayfield in west Kentucky, where a candle factory was levelled, killing at least eight people. Police and fire stations in Mayfield were destroyed, homes were flattened or lost roofs, giant trees were uprooted and street signs mangled. At least six people died in an Amazon distribution centre in Edwardsville in Illinois that was badly damaged. Two people were killed and others were injured and trapped at the Monette Manor nursing home in Arkansas. Joe Biden declared a major federal disaster in Kentucky on Sunday, following a request from Beshear, who described the tornadoes as the most destructive in the state’s history. Biden has separately announced that he will ask the Environmental Protection Agency to examine what role climate change might have played in the storms. Some people in communities close to factories that were damaged have questioned why those factories stayed open after storm warnings were issued. Tornadoes are whirling, vertical air columns that form from thunderstorms and stretch to the ground and travel with ferocious speed. Thunderstorms occur when denser, drier cold air is pushed over warmer, humid air, conditions scientists call atmospheric instability. As that happens, an updraft is created when the warm air rises. When winds vary in speed or direction at different altitudes – a condition known as wind shear - the updraft will start to spin. These changes in winds produce the spin necessary for a tornado. The greatest threat from tornadoes is typically in spring and summer, and although tornadoes can happen at any time of the year in the US, it is incredibly rare for twisters as destructive as those that struck on Friday to occur in December. “It was really a late spring type of setup in in the middle of December,” Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini told Associated Press. Usually, there’s not a lot of instability in the winter that’s needed for tornadoes because the air isn’t as warm and humid, he added. This time there was. Scientists have been wary of attributing the frequency and intensity of convective storms that can produce tornadoes to climate change, in part because historical and observational data around tornadoes is relatively limited. In simple terms, that’s due to fact that tornadoes are relatively small and can easily go unreported, said Michael Tippett, a professor of applied mathematics at Columbia University. “In linking climate change to extreme weather like hurricanes or extreme rainfall and flooding some connections are easier to make than others,” Tippett told the Guardian. “Making the connection to tornadoes is the hardest of all.” In a recent paper, Future Global Convective Environments, the authors looked at the atmospheric ingredients necessary to produce extreme weather that could in turn produce tornadoes. The authors projected that for each degree of global temperature increase, conditions favourable to severe weather increased by 5%–20%. “We have circumstantial evidence, yes, but the key caveat is that favourable conditions do not guarantee that a storm occurs,” Tippett said. Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at Woodwell Climate Research Center, said climate change was “making some of the ingredients needed to create an outbreak like this more likely”. “The atmosphere has more fuel in it now, both in terms of heat and moisture. The large dip in the jet-stream that created the clash between warm, tropical air and cold Arctic air – another necessary ingredient – is also more likely to occur in our changed climate.” “It all makes sense, but the rarity of these events makes it difficult to detect any definite signal of change in tornado behaviour.” Some scientists have been able to establish that the number of tornadoes in large outbreaks is on the rise and that the weather environments that produce severe storms are occurring more often. The five largest US winter tornado outbreaks have all hit since 1999. “Circumstantial evidence points to an increase in frequency, but it’s not a direct line of evidence,” said Tippett.

12/14/2021,"Nearly three days on from its astonishingly ill-judged response to the finding that Robbie Dunne had bullied and harassed his fellow rider Bryony Frost over seven months in 2020, the Professional Jockeys’ Association finally stopped digging on Sunday. Frost, it accepted, really had been bullied: on the racecourse, in the weighing room and online. It wasn’t just a feeling after all. The PJA’s splenetic statement ran to nearly 1,000 words, most of which had apparently been written for the benefit of any or every jump jockey bar the one it should have been doing its utmost to support.  It railed at the British Horseracing Authority counsel Louis Weston’s claim of a “rancid” weighing-room culture, accused the independent panel of bias without offering any evidence to back up their claim, and generally sought to share the blame for Frost’s shocking treatment at the hands of another PJA member as widely as possible. David Bass, meanwhile, the PJA’s jump jockey president, suggested that “Bryony and Robbie have been let down by the BHA.” The possibility that PJA members as a whole had been let down by Dunne did not seem to cross anyone’s mind. And this came just hours after the panel had at least partially accepted Weston’s warnings about weighing-room culture, when Brian Barker, its chair, expressed “real concern” about a “deep-rooted, coercive” culture which is “not conducive to the good health and development of modern-day race-riding”. A point that was missed in the PJA’s knee-jerk response is that no one is claiming that the riders’ long-standing practice of self-policing disputes behind closed doors means that deliberate bullying is either excused or condoned. What the Dunne case does show, however, is that it can allow abuse to go undetected or overlooked, which is unacceptable in any workplace, no matter how unique.

But at the same time, they are not, and cannot be, team players in the manner of a football club’s dressing room. Jockeys are colleagues and also often friends, but they are individuals too, in a fiercely competitive sport. They compete race-by-race and also month-by-month, looking to build a career in the knowledge that one winning ride could open a door that leads to many more. Every weighing room also includes riders, both male and female, with a wide range of age, experience and success. There is obvious potential for jealousy, grudges and rivalries, and if there is also a sense that some have earned the right to rebuke and discipline others, the potential for that culture to be exploited by a bully should be obvious. Bullies are angry and insecure individuals who try to deal with their frustrations by taking them out on others. It may or may not be a coincidence that Dunne’s chosen target was not simply a female rider, but the most successful female rider in the room. Dunne’s evidence to the panel was riddled with contradictions. His witness statement, for instance, claimed that until a post-race incident at Stratford in July 2020, when he said that frustration with what he perceived to be shortcomings in Frost’s riding style boiled over, his relationship with her had been “good or perfect”. Yet as Weston showed in an excruciating exchange for the rider, he had singled her out for abuse in a tweet in April 2020 which mentioned only Yala Enki, Frost’s “ride” in the Virtual Grand National, but was clearly understood by his followers – fellow jockeys no doubt included - to be a deliberate dig at Frost. The weighing-room culture did not cause Dunne to be a bully, but it allowed his bullying to go unchallenged until Frost had the courage to stand up to him. If that point too is eventually accepted by those jockeys who have seemingly shunned Frost for daring to speak out, there will surely be a way to address the current culture’s flaws, without sacrificing the shared experience that so many riders rightly cherish.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: Weighing room culture allowed Dunne bullying of Frost to go unchallenged,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/13/talking-horses-weighing-room-culture-allowed-robbie-dunne-bullying-bryony-frost-to-go-unchallenged-horse-racing
12/14/2021,"As the British film-maker Nicolas Roeg was scouring Arnhem Land, in Australia’s Northern Territory, in search of an Indigenous Australian man to star in Walkabout (1971), he chanced upon the 16-year-old ceremonial dancer David Gulpilil. When asked his name, the teenager responded with the only English word he knew: “Yes.” Looking back on the film in 2015, he said: “I thought I was going to be John Wayne.” Gulpilil, who has died of cancer aged 68, was a more amorphous and mysterious presence. As if Roeg’s fragmented, free-associative storytelling was not startling enough, Gulpilil’s performance was a shock to the system for many viewers.  As the tracker who befriends a teenager (Jenny Agutter) and her young brother (played by Roeg’s son Luc) when they are stranded in the outback following their father’s suicide, he embodied an unspoiled naturalism distinct from anything else in screen acting at the time. Friends interviewed in the 2002 television documentary Gulpilil: One Red Blood insisted he was not pretending, and that he was playing his scenes, such as the powerful love dance he performs for Agutter, with unguarded sincerity. Despite speaking no English in the film, Gulpilil conveyed meaning unhindered to audiences who would surely never have encountered anyone like him before on film. (Portrayals of Indigenous Australian characters in cinema of the time, such as the 1967 drama Journey Out of Darkness, were by actors of other ethnicities.) Which is not to say that he necessarily understood this ambiguous, poetic film. Asked by a young fan why his character hanged himself at the end, he said: “I wanna know, too!” His range was exemplified by two very different films made in 1976: the family favourite Storm Boy, in which he helps a boy to raise pelicans, and the outlaw adventure Mad Dog Morgan, starring Dennis Hopper as a 19th-century Irish bushranger and Gulpilil as his partner-in-crime. Their dynamic was reproduced off-screen: it was Hopper’s hard-drinking antics that introduced the younger actor to drugs and alcohol, addictions that would blight his later life. (He was jailed in 2011 for assaulting his wife, and later entered rehab.) During the making of Mad Dog Morgan, Gulpilil disappeared from filming and had to be retrieved by Indigenous trackers. Upon his return, he explained that he had wanted to ask the kookaburras and the trees for their opinion of his co-star. “They all say Dennis is crazy,” he reported. He was best known to international audiences for a memorable turn in the hit comedy Crocodile Dundee (1986), in which he played Neville Bell, a “city boy” who daubs himself with paint before visiting his father, a tribal elder. He nailed perfectly one of the movie’s best gags, in which he prevents a woman in the outback from photographing him. “You believe it’ll take your spirit away?” she asks. “No,” he replies. “You’ve got the lens cap on.” Gulpilil was from the Mandhalpuyngu clan in Arnhem Land and was assigned his birth date by missionaries, who named him David. After the death of his parents, David was raised by his extended family around the missionary station in Maningrida. “I don’t know how old I am,” he said later. “I was a lost child.” He was educated at the missionary school and, steeped in his own Yolngu culture, trained as a tracker, dancer and hunter. In the wake of Walkabout, he travelled the world. Despite his improved grasp of English, he felt frustrated at others’ inability to understand him. “The journalists came along like ants,” he said. “I tried really hard to talk to them but I cried because I couldn’t translate my language.” Among his Australian television work was the detective series Boney (1972), in which he played several different characters as well as appearing as a dancer in the opening and closing credits. He starred with Richard Chamberlain in Peter Weir’s environmental thriller The Last Wave (1977). But he was disillusioned when the international success of Crocodile Dundee did not improve his life. Gulpilil enjoyed a renaissance at the start of this century, starring first in Philip Noyce’s Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) and then beginning a fruitful collaboration with the Dutch-Australian film-maker Rolf de Heer. This resulted in his first leading role, as a guide helping three white men hunt a fugitive, in The Tracker (also 2002). Both pictures were part of what De Heer called a “glorious outbreak” of Indigenous-themed cinema. It was Gulpilil who suggested to De Heer the idea of making the first full-length feature conceived by, worked on and portraying the history of Indigenous Australian tribes. He also provided the creative spark by showing the director a photograph taken by the anthropologist Donald Thomson of Indigenous men forging through a swamp in bark canoes. The result, Ten Canoes (2006), was a playful shaggy-dog story about a young tribesman lusting after his brother’s wife; Gulpilil was its narrator. He won the best actor prize in the Un Certain Regard section of the Cannes film festival for his performance in Charlie’s Country (2014), De Heer’s drama about an Indigenous man returning to the bush after feeling at odds with modern society. Other films included John Hillcoat’s brutal western The Proposition (2005), starring Guy Pearce and Ray Winstone, and Baz Luhrmann’s old-fashioned adventure Australia (2008). Hugh Jackman, his co-star on the latter, called him “one of the greatest actors Australia has ever produced”. Gulpilil also played the father of his original Storm Boy character in a 2019 remake of that fim, and was the subject of an acclaimed documentary, My Name Is Gulpilil (2021), in which he reflected on his life and his lung cancer diagnosis. His role in improving the representation of Indigenous people was beyond dispute. Before he had reached 30, he was already the subject of the Australian edition of This Is Your Life. In its closing minutes, he was asked what he wanted to achieve. “I’m not doing it only for myself but for Australia and my people and our culture,” he said. “I’m doing it for black and white to know better. That we have culture and history that still exists. I’ll keep trying.” He married several times, and had seven children of his own, as well as several others who called him father, following the Yolngu custom.

12/14/2021,"Just now, Boris Johnson matters. He matters because he is Britain’s prime minister at a critical moment in the pandemic. The authority of his office should be directed at achieving the one reasonably sure defence against it: mass vaccination. Sunday night’s announcement that the vaccination programme is being stepped up to get third doses to all adults by the end of December will require a million doses to be administered every day for the rest of the month. That is a tall order and may not be achieved, but it should be treated as a national priority to fend off another Christmas and New Year in lockdown. Johnson must know that his authority, along with his dignity, is in the worst possible state to order this. His appearance on Sunday, his hair artfully dishevelled, dwarfed by an absurdly large union jack, was that of a clown acting a Ruritanian princeling. His daily photo-opportunities, his misjudgments, mendacities and “global Britain” vacuities insult public intelligence and merely line him up for one fall after another. He has become the media’s favourite victim, a politician inviting constant ribaldry and rotten eggs.  It is easy to accuse Johnson’s vaccination promise of coming too late, and its implausible but impressive-sounding million-jabs-a-day target as merely a flashy distraction from his woes. It is also easy to point out that his messy private life and inability to treasure truth make a mockery of his Sunday-night lecture to the nation on moral duty. Yet the vaccination campaign is vital. A pandemic is not unlike a war. At such times the state has a licence, indeed a duty, to take control of new areas of public life. For that control to be effective, it must offer leadership and that must come from the top, from the prime minister. This applies even when that prime minister seems unable to invest his office with its customary dignity or find able colleagues to serve under him in anything other than a shambolic fashion. Circumstance, not justice, entitles him to ask for a degree of loyalty and obedience. Johnson is reportedly furious with the media, and especially the BBC, for a fixation on last year’s lockdown parties in Downing Street. The media can reply that the fault is entirely his, for constantly lying about them. There is nothing so worthy of ridicule as a politician caught in a rat trap. The prime minister seems to believe that the point has been made and coverage of “partygate” has moved from a Westminster gameshow to a personal hate-fest. There is some justice in this charge. But asking a member of his staff to inquire into a possibly illegal activity in his office was hardly a reassuring means of kicking the issue into touch. As it is, Johnson brings a few assets to his current task. Until recently he has been a popular figure. He engages with the public when he encounters them. His bumbling humour when off piste is not unattractive. On Sunday his case that the Omicron Covid variant justified an emergency response was persuasive. If Johnson’s personal qualities have jeopardised this campaign it is for history and perhaps this week’s North Shropshire byelection to judge. They will certainly be entered on the charge sheet as and when Conservative MPs come to ponder who they want to lead them into the next election. At present an emergency is an emergency. The prime minister has asked parliament and the nation to rally round and the national interest indicates that they should do so. For the time being, Johnson deserves a break.

12/14/2021,"For many thousands of people, the festive season begins not with a visit to Father Christmas or popping an angel atop a tinselled tree, but with an explosion of dry ice and Roman Kemp bellowing “Make some noise!” Yes, it’s the annual two-night pop-fest that is Capital Radio’s Jingle Bell Ball, fully powered by the baubles-out, have-another-one-for-Santa attitude of the crowd. That energy is needed, as Covid outbreaks have meant some big-name cancellations: Coldplay on Saturday night, and Lil Nas X and Mabel on Sunday. Justin Bieber therefore has an extended set on Saturday, which he performs with aplomb and in a denim jacket so large he could have smuggled in several puppies. Sorry brings the house down, though it’s Lonely, with its straight-from-the heart lyrics, which is the highlight. In support is pop-house star Jax Jones, who always goes fully tinsel-tastic: in 2019, this meant roller-skating Christmas puddings; this year Jones is dressed as a Gucci Santa, surrounded by giant robots, his eerie-yet-catchy dance bangers bringing a frenzied audience reaction.  Sunday night feels makeshift in comparison, with less festive effort from the acts. Opener Joel Corry’s house has a bleak feel: nursery rhyme tunes, tinny vocals and adrenal rushes of beats feel cynical, no matter how often the ex-Geordie Shore star queries if “you guys are ready to go to the club” and someone bangs the glitter cannons. Pop queen Anne-Marie and her hard-working dancers offer some slick verve, and Friends’ “1-2-3-4-5-6000 times” chorus engages full-arena singing. KSI, now one of the biggest names in pop as well as YouTube, brings on Craig David and Ella Henderson, and the show lifts as his infectious delight is met with equal love from the audience. Griff is similarly pleased to be on the stage – she confesses to being in the JBB audience just two years ago, watching Taylor Swift – and, though her friendly chat is a little off-key for the event size, her three-song set showcases her powerful voice: warmer and more soulful than you’d expect from her cool singles. After the break, two last-minute replacements are drafted in. A be-vested Tom Grennan sails through his four songs, big-voiced and upbeat, though his energy can’t make up for a lack of personality, even on the Calvin Harris-produced By Your Side. Brighton rapper ArrDee, a tiny Action Man in his army-patterned tracksuit, is a living firework, as he bounds through his innuendo-packed raps like a speedy southern Aitch. A “shall we nip to the loo now?” DJ session from Capital Xtra’s MistaJam, with Shane Codd, Nathan Dawe and Jonasu, brings the house down simply by playing a slowed, beat-driven All I Want for Christmas. All fine, if slightly unmemorable. It is left to the veterans to show how pop should be done. The recently reformed JLS look small on the stage, without DJs or band, but proceed to swell the arena with good-time vibes. Snappy in black – head-to-toe leather for Aston Merrygold, a brave choice given his propensity for a standing somersault – the now thirtysomething boy band are slick, engaging and demonstrate the never-die appeal of correctly applied formation dancing: Everybody in Love ratchets up the atmosphere from “high sugar” to “ambulance on stand-by”. Finally, Ed Sheeran. Even more pared-down than JLS, Sheeran performs his 10 songs with nothing more than loop pedals and guitar, though he brings on Anne-Marie for 2002, and a keyboardist for the final few hits. Like a slick primary school teacher, Sheeran tells us what he is doing (“Everything I play is live, and I just loop it here”) as well as what we are going to do. “These are sleigh bells,” he says, at the beginning of Merry Christmas, before teaching us the chorus. “You’re going to sing this,” he informs, “and at the end, you’re going to bounce.” Promising “all killer, no filler”, he starts with Bloodstream, plays Thinking Out Loud as an uplifting festival anthem rather than a love song, and whips through Castle on the Hill, Perfect, Shape of You and onward. The crowd respond as one: mobile phones aloft, arms waving like pampas grass, full-throated hollering of every single word. A man more comfortable in his skin would be hard to imagine: Sheeran performs with such warmth and generosity, and with such nailed-on tunes, that – somewhat unbelievably – every single Jingle Beller leaves their Ball even more sloshed with Christmas spirit than when they arrived.",Arts/Music,"Jingle Bell Ball review – Ed Sheeran is all killer, no stocking filler",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/13/jingle-bell-ball-review-ed-sheeran-is-all-killer-no-stocking-filler
12/14/2021,"It must hurt to be Simon Cowell in 2021. For two decades, Cowell was the undisputed master of the singing talent show, trampling the charts into paste with his relentless barrage of power ballads and sob stories. But then The X Factor withered away, and his spot was taken by no end of niche singing shows. Want to watch famous people singing in elaborate costumes? There’s The Masked Singer. Want to watch judges try to figure out whether people can sing, without actually hearing them sing? There’s I Can Hear Your Voice. Want to watch singers cower backstage as their voices are implanted into harrowing frog-style avatars? Go to the US and watch Alter Ego. Or rather, don’t.  Which brings us to Walk the Line: Simon Cowell’s attempt to reassert himself on the genre he once dominated. How exactly does he plan to do that? By hooking up the corpse of The X Factor to an electrical current and making it jerk about for kicks, of course. All the old tropes are present and correct. Is Walk the Line presented inside a hangar-sized shiny-floored studio? Yes. Is there an audience that whoops on command so efficiently it sometimes borders on North Korean-style propaganda? Yes. Does it take one hour of television and make it feel like six? Yes. Does it consist of loads and loads of people blurting out wobbly amateur versions of songs you have only ever heard played in supermarkets? For the most part, yes. There is one small difference that separates Walk the Line from The X Factor, though. This new show has zero interest in letting any of these people establish a career. Every episode, five new singers appear, and every episode four of them are binned off into oblivion. The fifth – the winner, if you will – is offered £10,000. They can either take it and sod off, or compete all over again the following night in the hope that they will win £500,000 at the end of the series. But, yes, aside from that, this is The X Factor all over. Not that Simon Cowell is anywhere to be seen. While this was supposed to be his big television comeback, he decided recently to remain offscreen and cede his spot to everyone’s favourite sub-Cowell fun-sponge, Gary Barlow. Barlow now heads a judging panel consisting of Craig David (aggressively anonymous), Dawn French (reliably lovely) and Alesha Dixon (hired because if she goes more than eight months without judging something on TV, her kidneys will explode). You have to wonder if any of them knew what they were signing up for, though, because never have TV judges been more unnecessary. All the hard work, all the actual judging, gets done at the end of each episode by the studio audience, who vote for a winner on electronic pads. This means the judges are only really there to pad out the running time with cliched soundbites. I haven’t seen their contracts, so I can’t be certain, but I suspect the legal definition of their role here might be “rusk”. As for the contestants, they have all just been plucked off the generic singing competition contestant conveyor belt. In the first episode, one guy performed a John Lewis advert version of God Only Knows, one guy attempted to shoehorn as many extraneous notes into Purple Rain as he could, a set of drag queens called Queenz sang a song with the word “Queen” in the title, and one woman did something so bland I wouldn’t even be able to describe it to you under hypnosis. They were, by and large, the musical equivalent of pre-chewed food. Last night’s episode was won by the fifth contestant, a woman from Bristol who sang a song she had written herself. At the climax, she decided to stay on for the next night’s episode. I suspect this is what will make the show gripping in the long run; because all the dramatic tension comes from wondering whether or not the singers will hold their nerve. But that is redundant for me because, now that I have finished the episode I was contractually obliged to watch, I am going to spend the rest of my life pretending that Walk the Line doesn’t exist. Call it self-care, if you like.",Arts/Television & radio,Walk the Line: has Simon Cowell finally created the cruellest reality show ever?,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/13/be-kind-to-yourself-pretend-simon-cowell-new-singing-show-walk-the-line-does-not-exist
12/14/2021,"Touchdown in South Australia was probably a relief for England’s cricketers, no doubt glad to see the back of Queensland after their soggy buildup was followed by defeat at the Gabba. Before landing, those with a window seat also got a glorious view of the Adelaide Oval, scene of this week’s second Test. From above it is hard to miss a ground that is three parts modern mega-stadium to one part grass bank and sits nestled in the parkland north of Adelaide’s city centre. Where once there were sloped terracotta roofs, three giant stands with bulbous white canopies now horseshoe around the outfield like a huge comfy armchair almost ready for the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man to slump into after a long day terrorising the public.  The revamp was met with near widespread praise upon completion in 2014, which was not a given. Australia may be a country that is always moving forward by way of disposition – see the emu and the kangaroo on the crest of the fabled Baggy Green for more details – but renovating the home stadium of Don Bradman, the Chappell brothers, Jason Gillespie et al risked compromising the ground’s bucolic charm. Yet the architects managed to pull off the ideal blend of increased capacity (now up to 53,000), spectator comfort and a sense of history; as well as the Bradman Collection in the museum – where would-be Dons can similarly hone techniques with a stump and golf ball - a link with the past has been retained by the hill at the northern end and the famous old scoreboard, built in 1911, will once again tick over this week. In recent times the Adelaide Oval has also set about creating a new tradition in the shape of the pink-ball Test. Not that everyone agrees. Ever since the first such match in 2015, when the Australia and New Zealand players were paid danger money to give the new concept a go, it has been a source of grumbling among a local press pack that might prefer to transport tastebuds to the Barossa Valley of an evening. But through a combination of alluring salmon skies at dusk, the flare of the pink Kookaburra as it whizzes down under lights, the scope for spectators to pitch up after work and purchase a twilight ticket, and peak viewing hours for the television audience at home, the format has taken hold. Crowds are capped at 35,000 per day this Test but nearly 200,000 spectators passed through the turnstiles over five days four years ago. The fact that Australia have won all five day-night Tests staged in Adelaide has probably helped a bit here too. A key driver of the revolution was Keith Bradshaw, the former South Australia Cricket Association chief executive who sadly died in November aged 58 after a long battle with myeloma. A popular and progressive administrator, but one who never lacked a sense of history and tradition with this Bradshaw, a Tasmanian, had made the move back in 2011 after five years as secretary of the MCC. It is fitting that those two worlds come together on Thursday when the newly-forged “Bradshaw Bell” is rung five minutes before the start of play for the first time. This was a tradition introduced during Bradshaw’s time at Lord’s - Ian Botham and Viv Richards were among the first in 2007 - and beginning this new sound in Adelaide this week will be his fiance, Helen Todd, and daughters Juliet Bigg and Eliza Bradshaw. Out on the field there will be decent representation for South Australia. Travis Head flew home from Brisbane a day early to see his family and will now stride out on to his home ground bursting with confidence after his 152 punished England’s leggy bowlers at the Gabba. Alex Carey, though light on runs with the bat, is also a returning hero in these parts after becoming the first wicketkeeper to pouch eight catches on Test debut. Australia will be without one of their pink-ball specialists, however, after confirmation on Monday that Josh Hazlewood is officially out of the second Test with a side strain. The expectation now is that Jhye Richardson, a pacy purveyor of outswing, will step up as his replacement, while Usman Khawaja is on standby if David Warner’s rib injury proves too painful to overcome in training. Certainly the absence of Hazlewood presents an opportunity for England, so to the fact that Steve Smith averages just 31 from five day-night Test matches at the Adelaide Oval. In Brisbane the tourists had a new plan for Smith, with five men stationed out on the leg side but their seamers still pursuing a line on or just outside off stump. When Mark Wood went wide of the crease and found his edge on 12, it worked. These may be mere crumbs of comfort for a team still licking its wounds after that nine-wicket thrashing in Brisbane. But if they are looking for inspiration, they could do worse than step out onto the Adelaide Oval and take in their surroundings.",Sport/Sport,Adelaide a glorious setting for what England hope will be a new beginning,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/13/adelaide-a-glorious-setting-for-what-england-hope-will-be-a-new-beginning-cricket-ashes-australia
