4/28/2022,"Nothing on earth is quite as depressing as the moment a celebrity starts getting into NFTs. There you’ll be, quite happy following them on social media when, bang, up pops a sub-Banksy cartoon of a monkey in a wig and a falsely jubilant message celebrating the fact that they’ve joined some sort of club. NFTs somehow represent all the worst things about celebrity combined. It’s both an obnoxious display of status and a very clear indication that these people see their fans as nothing more than a tradable commodity. It was gross when Gwyneth Paltrow did it. It was gross when Brie Larson did it. It’s gross when anyone does it, quite frankly. Or at least it was, because now David Cronenberg is getting into NFTs, and he may be the saviour of the entire thing. Cronenberg, you see, has decided to sell a unique piece of art as an NFT. Not for him a picture of a monkey or a painting that looks like it was done by an eight-year-old. No, Cronenberg understands that true art involves giving a little piece of yourself to your audience. And that’s why he’s selling a photo of his kidney stones. Apparently the stones were passed over the course of two years. His doctors reportedly asked him to submit them for chemical analysis, but he decided to keep hold of them on the basis that “they’re too beautiful to be destroyed”. This article includes content provided by Instagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. That’s questionable but, judging by the photo of the NFT that was posted on Instagram last month, they are at least too Cronenbergian to be destroyed. Up close, they’re a weird mix of biology and geology: some look like pebbles, some look like coral. One has a fleshy nub protruding from it. One, if you look hard enough, appears to be smiling. If you’re a Cronenberg fan, this is as intimate a memento as you’re likely to find. Better yet, Cronenberg has indicated that, if the NFT auction goes high enough, he will consider throwing in his actual kidney stones as an add-on. And that’s where things get exciting. Because, while NFTs still have the ugly air of a pyramid scheme about them, getting to hold Cronenberg’s real kidney stones in your bare hands would be a genuine, once-in-a-lifetime thrill. And if that’s the case, they would be a bargain. The starting bid for Cronenberg’s kidney stones is 10 Ethereum, which works out at around £23,000. And while that seems a lot, I urge you to think back to 2006. This is when none other than William Shatner passed his own kidney stones, one so big that, at the time, he declared that “you’d want to wear it on your finger”. Shatner being the enterprising fellow that he is, he quickly decided to sell the stone to the highest bidder, which turned out to be an online casino that had previously bought Pope Benedict XVI’s old Volkswagen Golf and a cheese sandwich displaying the face of the Virgin Mary. The cost of Shatner’s kidney stone? Fourteen thousand pounds. Here’s where the maths comes in. Shatner had only one kidney stone to sell. Cronenberg has 18 of them. So while his overall price is higher than Shatner’s, his price per stone is markedly lower. We’re talking £1,277 a stone here, which is basically nothing. That’s less than a week at Center Parcs during the summer holidays. You can embed one of Cronenberg’s kidney stones into a dream catcher and use it to ward off evil spirits at night. Can you do that with a week at Center Parcs? No, you cannot. The whole thing is an unbelievable bargain, and you’d be stupid not to buy them now.",Arts/Film,Body shock: why Cronenberg’s kidney stones could be the saviour of NFTs,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/28/body-shock-why-cronenbergs-kidney-stones-could-be-the-saviour-of-nfts
4/28/2022,"My husband, Alan Hill, who has died aged 81, had a long career teaching mathematics and subsequently worked tirelessly to improve the local environment in Fletcher Moss Park, Didsbury, Manchester. He established a nature reserve there, led weekly walks and natural history groups, and acted as a leader of the garden volunteers. The son of Connie (nee Payne) and Frank Hill, Alan was born in Madras, India, where his father was a textile chemist. In 1951, Alan’s parents sent him and his younger brother to boarding school in Buxton, before moving back to the UK themselves four years later. He attended Lancaster Royal grammar school and after leaving was awarded a student apprenticeship with the aero engine manufacturer Bristol Siddeley in Coventry, which involved taking a three-year degree course in mechanical engineering at Manchester University. During his first year Alan decided that he wanted a career that involved supporting others, so after graduation he took a teaching diploma and became a maths teacher. Alan began his working life at Broughton high school in Salford. He was a natural teacher and this was the start of a career that he found truly rewarding. In 1967 he moved to Burnage high school, where he would go from teacher and union leader to headteacher by the time of his retirement in 2000. Alan married Joan Waywell in 1968 and they had two sons, Tom and Pete. The couple divorced, and later Alan found new happiness with Teresa Wallace, his partner for a decade; they shared a love of walking and an interest in social justice. Their life together was cut short by her early death not long after their marriage in 1997. Alan and I met at the Manchester Field Club, a natural history club that he ran for nearly 20 years, and we were married in 2011. We enjoyed a mutual love of botany and birdwatching and spent happy hours searching for flowers on trips in the UK. Alan was chair of the friends of Fletcher Moss Park and Parsonage Gardens from 2006 till his death. He organised volunteer gardeners to care for the park, liaised with the city council, helped to organise park events, led health walks and promoted nature-friendly policies. His passion for nature proved an inspiration to others, and he was thoughtful and community-minded. He remained a caring stepfather to Teresa’s children, Maria and Martin, and to my children, Cathy, Nick and Tim. He especially loved spending time with his grandchildren, Maria and Daniel. He is survived by his children, stepchildren and grandchildren, and by two stepgrandchildren.",News/Environment,Alan Hill obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/28/alan-hill-obituary
4/28/2022,"Elon Musk has said Twitter must be “politically neutral”, in a comment posted last night after a wave of account deletions by left-leaning users on the social media network. In the days since Musk’s $44bn (£34.5bn) acquisition offer was accepted by Twitter’s board, hundreds of thousands of users have closed their accounts on the site, the company confirmed, leading to a dip in follower numbers for left-leaning politicians and celebrities such as Barack and Michelle Obama, Taylor Swift and Jeremy Corbyn. Meanwhile, rightwing influencers such as the far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, Boris Johnson, and Ted Cruz have all had large gains as new users sign up for the service. In the latest of a series of tweets about the platform he hopes to take into private ownership, the world’s richest man suggested he would not seek to politicise Twitter. “For Twitter to deserve public trust it must be politically neutral, which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally,” Musk tweeted yesterday evening. In earlier comments, Musk has been outspoken about his desire to promote free speech on Twitter, saying that he is “against censorship that goes far beyond the law”. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect,” Musk added. “Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.” His statements have been interpreted as criticism of Twitter’s existing moderation policies, particularly of those that have affected the US right. The former president Donald Trump was banned from the social network in 2021 for his role in encouraging the storming of the US Capitol, while Greene had her personal account permanently suspended after breaking the platform’s five-strike rule. But Musk has argued that his changes would affect all users. “Attacks are coming thick and fast, primarily from the left, which is no surprise,” he said, in a reply to the rightwing media personality Ben Shapiro. “However, I should be clear that the right will probably be a little unhappy too. My goal is to maximise area under the curve of total human happiness, which means the ~80% of people in the middle.” Currently, the response to the acquisition is not equally distributed, however. Katy Perry, the pop star who is the site’s third biggest user, lost 7,000 followers in a few days, while Obama, whose 132 million followers makes the former US president’s account the most popular on the site, lost 5,000 on Tuesday alone. Followers of the former first lady, Michelle Obama, are down by nearly 20,000. The Republican senator Ted Cruz added more than 60,000 followers, while Greene gained more than 100,000 followers in the last week, a tenfold increase in the normal rate. Followers of the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, are up by nearly 10,000, but the Twitter account of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has lost just over 1,000 followers. Some speculated that the changes were the result of action from Twitter “cleaning house” in preparation for the acquisition, but the social network instead said they were the result of “organic” activity. “While we continue to take action on accounts that violate our spam policy which can affect follower counts, these fluctuations appear to largely be a result of an increase in new account creation and deactivation,” a spokesperson said in a statement. Much of Musk’s criticism for Twitter’s moderation practices has been focused on a single employee, Vijaya Gadde, the company’s chief legal office. His tweets sparked tens of thousands of abusive messages targeted at the executive, and a public rebuke from a former Twitter chief executive Dick Costolo. “What’s going on?” Costolo tweeted at Musk. “You’re making an executive at the company you just bought the target of harassment and threats.” “Bullying is not leadership,” he added later, to which Musk replied, “What are talking about? I’m just saying Twitter needs to be politically neutral.”",News/Technology,Elon Musk says Twitter must be ‘politically neutral’ as some leftwing users quit,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/28/elon-musk-says-twitter-must-be-politically-neutral-as-some-leftwing-users-quit

4/28/2022,"In fear of next week’s local elections, the cabinet thrashed around on Tuesday for cost of living eye-catchers that would cost the Treasury nothing. One of them costs the earth – Jacob Rees-Mogg’s call to abandon the net zero climate target. The other one costs children’s futures – a plan to cut numbers of nursery staff in England in the vain hope of reducing the high costs of childcare. Among advanced Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development economies, only the Israeli government spends less on childcare than the UK as a percentage of GDP. Just as the cabinet was meeting, Ofsted released an alarming report saying Covid had hit the early years workforce hardest. “Thousands have left the sector since the first lockdown in 2020, while those who have stayed are often struggling to get by on low wages.” More than 5,000 childcare providers have closed down in the past two years, Ofsted reports. As ever, says the Early Years Alliance, the areas with the least childcare and fewest nurseries are poorer districts where children need it most. The head of Ofsted, Amanda Spielman, told the Today programme yesterday that many under-twos – who have lived all their lives under Covid – urgently need extra help with delayed speech, vocabulary and social skills. Yet just when they need more highly skilled teaching, the number of childcare places drops. Spielman told Today that it was “concerning” that fewer parents are using childcare, and many are cutting their hours. Research from Pregnant Then Screwed shows 62% of women spending more on childcare than on their rent or mortgage. This is lose-lose all round: 1.7m women are unable to work as long as they want to, according to the Women’s Budget Group, because they can’t afford astronomical childcare costs. The greatest loss is to children themselves, who may never catch up with more affluent kids who get more and better nursery education (genuinely free nursery places with no hidden top-ups are hardest to find in poorest places). The bizarre government subsidy system gives more help to higher-earning than lower-earning households. Now the government proposes that instead of more trained early years workers, very young children can have fewer: just one care worker looking after four under-twos, instead of three. Has anyone in the cabinet tried that, all day, every day? Rees-Mogg (“never changed a nappy”) could ask his famous nanny. So much for levelling up children’s future life chances. Staff are now leaving the sector for other industries; many are “exhausted” and feel “undervalued”, with 16,000 nursery places lost in five years, says Neil Leitch of the Early Years Alliance. Leitch believes that cuts in the staff-to-child ratio would only cause more early years workers to quit. What’s more, “not a penny” of the so-called savings made from this measure will ever be passed on to parents, he says. “Nurseries will pay off debts, and pay their staff a bit more to stop them leaving.” It took two and a half years and a freedom of information request for the Early Years Alliance to force the government to publish its official report showing that the ministers knew they were underfunding the sector by £1.7bn – making it completely impossible for nurseries to provide the amount of free childcare the government pretended it would offer. Leitch says last month’s spending review offered only cuts for nurseries, with below-inflation rises for the next three years. Of the many monstrous acts of vandalism committed by the Tories since 2010, one that did exceptional damage was the destruction of Labour’s best achievement, its 3,600 Sure Start children’s centres. As well as good nurseries, many had become remarkable local community hubs that offered new families every help they needed, from midwives and health visitors to speech and language therapists, open-door play schemes, psychiatric help for depressed parents, help with job seeking and adult education and training. Every family would get the earliest support to have every child ready for school, catching child development problems early. Some Sure Start centres still exist, where councils, despite savage cuts, have clung on to them. Some state-maintained nurseries have survived, the highest-quality beacons of nursery education, in a sea of often low-quality threadbare private provision. But most Sure Starts have gone. A child’s first 1,000 days matter most: after that, it’s all repair and catch-up, which costs more. Sure Start was based on US Head Start research that followed people over a 30-year period from childhood to adulthood and found that after two intensive years of nursery teaching and family support, every $1 spent yielded $7 saved in later life, in better jobs, lower crime, and a lower chance of mental illness. The shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, recently made a pledge to the teachers conference to increase the early years pupil premium more than fourfold and improve the quality and provision of nursery support. In a speech later this week she is set to reprise the great value of Sure Start. But now we have Liz Truss in power, who in 2013 wanted to cut childcare staff to a ratio of one care worker looking after six under-twos. At the time, she refused many pleas to demonstrate how this could feasibly be done. This is just one example of cabinet thinking: every time these Tory ministers and their claque in the press call for cutting taxes and cutting spending, this is the kind of everyday brutalism they mean.

4/28/2022,"In Swaledale, between Keld and Reeth, the Swale Trail is a stunning 12-mile cycle track that snakesalong the crystalline River Swale in the Yorkshire Dales. The terrain is manageable for rookie cyclists (that would be me rather than my husband and teenage kids) and there are plenty of stops along the way to have a cold drink and give the pedals a rest. The national park has upgraded the established routes, improving the surface for a less bumpy ride and there are reassuring Swale Trail signposts along the way. About three-quarters of the route is on unsurfaced tracks, the rest on nearly traffic-free lanes. Dales Bike Centre near Reeth is a good place to hire bikes, as is Stage 1 Cycles at Hawes.Katya Kitchingman Easy to reach from Derby and Nottingham, the Nutbrook Cycle Trail, between Long Eaton and Heanor, offers easy miles of car-free cycling along canal towpaths and a former railway. We did it recently as a family, including grandchildren, so our age range was seven to 70! There are very few gradients. There are interesting places along the way, including Shipley Lake, the Pewit Carr nature reserve with its wetlands, Dockholme Lock and Fox Covert nature reserve (consideredpart of the ancient Sherwood Forest), so there’s a variety of great stopping points. It’s an easy 10-mile trip and the Nutbrook cafe has lovely ice-creams and milkshakes if some need an extra incentive to pedal on.Anne My kids and their friends became confident cyclists by riding the traffic-tree Cuckoo Trail in East Sussex, part of national cycle route 21. They hardly noticed the gentle gradients of the picturesque 14-mile route, which follows a disused railway through woodland and open countryside. Connecting three towns – Heathfield, Hailsham and Polegate – the trail can be accessed at various points that offer free parking and links to public transport. There are plenty of resting places for tired legs and a choice of refreshment stops just off route, including the Cuckoo Shack cafe (which has a playground). At the moment, much of the route is awash with bluebells, wood anemones and wild garlic.Alison Field There is a good off-road route between Lancaster and Morecambe that my sons (aged 13 and nine) and I have enjoyed. Parking can be found upriver of Lancaster at Crook O’ Lune and from there, the trail runsfor about eight miles along the River Lune downstream into Lancaster, over the Millennium Bridge and out to Morecambe and the sea. Morecambe has a wide promenade with enough room for pedestrians, scooters, roller skaters and skateboarders as well as cyclists to enjoy views across the bay to the Lake District fells. We extended our trip to Heysham for refreshments.Philip Mackintosh Our favourite family cycle route is the 21-mile Cinder Path from Whitby to Scarborough. This former railway line is practically traffic-free, with beautiful sea views. Hayburn Wyke beach and waterfall meet the path, making a perfect picnic spot, and the route passes a seal colony at Ravenscar. There are plenty of pitstops along the way before ice-cream at the beach to finish. From Scarborough, the Cinder Path starts next to the Sainsbury’s car park. If starting at Whitby, you’ll find it off a road called Southend Gardens near Pannett Park.Alison One of my favourite family-friendly cycles goes from Weymouth to Portland. It takes about 40 minutes to get there, and less on the way back, with highly appreciated downhills that bring in that crisp seaside smell. We start at Weymouth station, usually taking our bikes there on the train, and we finish, six miles later, at the Cove House Inn, Portland, with lovely seafood pasta and breathtaking views of Chesil Beach. The entire length is paved and well-signalled, and it passes through the Rodwell Trail (alongside a former railway line, and deep into woodland shade) and by Sandsfoot Castle, constructed by Henry VIII. It is an easy route that asks you to stop and take in the scenery.Bianca York’s solar cycle ride is great for families of all levels. My husband (40) learned to ride a bike during lockdown and this was his first big cycle. Models of the planets are staggered along the route with the distances between them to scale. There are some slight inclines but the 6½-mile trail, which follows the old east coast railway, is accessible for children and adults alike, with the planets providing an incentive to keep riding. There are plenty of points of interest, such as Brunswick organic nursery and Naburn steam swing bridge, and much of the trail passes through a nature reserve. It’s possible to start from York, where Get Cycling and Cycling Heaven hire out bikes. Some work is going on to improve the trail surfaces but we will be going back to complete the full cycle.Kayleigh McLocklan  Guardian Travel readers' tips Every week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels. A selection of tips will be featured online and may appear in print. To enter the latest competition visit the readers' tips homepage - For an easy ride through beautiful rolling countryside, it’s hard to beat the Hudson Way in East Yorkshire. The trail follows the old railway line between the historic market towns of Beverley and Market Weighton. Popular with walkers, horse riders and cyclists, it runs for about 10 miles. Along the route, you’ll pass disused stations, now transformed into characterful homes, and vantage points where you can drink in the gentle scenery of the Yorkshire Wolds. The best family rides have a great destination. Beverley has its amazing medieval Minster (one of the largest parish churches in the UK), its lovely shops and places to eat.Paul Hartley It’s not every bike ride that offers giraffe and rhino sightings as well as the more traditional draws of a country pub and an ice-cream on the beach. From Hythe in Kent, National Cycle Route 2 runs along the towpath between the Royal Military Canal and Port Lympne wildlife park, where only a fence separates you from a little piece of the African savanna. The route then takes quiet lanes heading south through Romney Marsh to St Mary in the Marsh, where the 15th-century Star Inn makes a perfect pitstop. From there, we like to head to the seaside at St Mary’s Bay and later cycle along the sea wall path back to Hythe, stopping on the way for an ice-cream on the beach.Brian Jackson You can cycle from one side of Cornwall to the other in a little more than an hour or so on Cornwall’s Mineral Tramways Coast to Coast bike trail. It’s a flat 11-mile journey along a tramway that used to allow goods to be transported from the mines to the sea. You can see the old mines along the way too, and pump and engine rooms add to the interest. Portreath on the north coast is the starting point, where you can also pick up a picnic at the HUB Cycling cafe to enjoy along the way. Bike hire, advice and repair kits are also available. Cycle south-east on the trail to the finish at the picturesque harbour village of Devoran.Greta",Lifestyle/Travel,‘Traffic-free lanes and beautiful views’: readers’ favourite UK family cycle routes,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/28/readers-favourite-uk-family-cycle-routes-cycling-off-road
4/28/2022,"England have confirmed that Ben Stokes will take over from Joe Root as the men’s Test captain. Root stood down from the role on Good Friday after five years following England’s 1-0 series defeat against West Indies, citing the toll and impact of leading the team. With England having recorded only one win in their last 17 Tests, the newly installed managing director of men’s cricket, Rob Key, has wasted no time in turning to the most obvious candidate to succeed Root in the all-rounder Stokes. “I am honoured to be given the chance to lead the England Test team. This is a real privilege, and I’m excited about getting started this summer,” said Stokes. “I want to thank Joe for everything he has done for English cricket and for always being a great ambassador for the sport all across the world. He has been a massive part of my development as a leader in the dressing room, and he will continue to be a key ally for me in this role.” Stokes’s first Test as permanent England captain will be at Lord’s against the world champions, New Zealand, starting on 2 June. The 30-year-old has been a talismanic player for England across the Test and one-day game, from the nail-biting innings that set up the 2019 World Cup win to his match-winning century at Headingley against Australia a few weeks later. The Durham all-rounder has 5,061 Test runs at an average of 35.89 and has taken 174 wickets. His career appeared under threat during a turbulent time off the field in 2017-18 when he was arrested, charged but ultimately found not guilty of affray after a brawl outside a nightclub in Bristol following an international one-day game. Since his return in 2018 he has regrouped and re-established himself as a leader within the team, regaining the vice-captaincy during the summer of 2019. He stood in when Root was absent for the birth of his second child in the summer of 2020 and, while England lost that Test against West Indies, they won all three of the ODIs against Pakistan when he stepped in for Eoin Morgan as captain during a Covid outbreak in 2021. Key said: “I had no hesitation in offering the role of Test captain to Ben. He epitomises the mentality and approach we want to take this team forward into the next era of red-ball cricket. I am delighted that he has accepted, and he is ready for the added responsibility and the honour. He thoroughly deserves the opportunity.”",Sport/Sport,‘A real privilege’ – Ben Stokes succeeds Joe Root as England’s Test captain,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/28/ben-stokes-succeeds-joe-root-as-england-test-cricket-captain
4/28/2022,"In 1611, John Donne composed a funeral elegy for 14-year-old Elizabeth Drury. It contained one of his most brilliant, unsettling lines: “One might almost say, her body thought.” Donne portrayed body and soul as radically, delightfully commingled. This is a poem that has long excited Donne commentators. John Carey, in his landmark 1981 Life, Mind and Art, was fascinated by Donne’s conviction that, as he wrote in a sermon, “all that the soul does, it does in, and with, and by the body”. Now the academic and children’s writer Katherine Rundell puts the poem centre stage in a book she describes as “both a biography of Donne and an act of evangelism”. For Rundell, Donne is writing into being a new ideal: a “completed meshing of body and imagination”. Rundell is right that Donne – “the greatest writer of desire in the English language” – must never be forgotten, and she is the ideal person to evangelise him for our age. She shares his linguistic dexterity, his pleasure in what TS Eliot called “felt thought”, his ability to bestow physicality on the abstract. “He was a man who walked so often in darkness that it became for him a daily commute,” she writes. “The body is, in its essentials, a very, very slow one-man horror show: a slowly decaying piece of meatish fallibility in clothes.” The facts of Donne’s life are well known. In addition to Carey’s study, there’s a recent comprehensive biography by John Stubbs. Donne was born into a Catholic family at a time of persecution; family members were imprisoned and tortured. Donne moved between success and penury, with a stint in law, an unsuccessful foray as an adventurer in Spain, and a period at court that ended when he secretly married Anne More and was thrown in prison by her father. Then there were years as the impoverished, frustrated father of 12 children (six died), a period of grief after his wife’s early death and his final efflorescence, at once unexpected and inevitable, as a clergyman who was swiftly promoted to dean of St Paul’s. It’s a biography filled with gaps and Rundell brings a zest for imaginative speculation to these. We know so little about Donne’s wife, but Rundell brings her alive as never before, dwelling on the daring of Anne’s acceptance of this man at a time when upper-class young women obeyed their fathers and, crucially, demonstrated their virtue by being unwooable. This is a love story, yet few of Donne’s love poems were written for Anne, and Rundell is good, too, on Donne as the swaggering womaniser who in reality had very little sex. She is convincing in her suggestion that Donne wrote his most satisfying erotic poems not for his lovers but for an audience of male friends. In effect, then, poems such as The Flea are exercises in showing off about women, and Rundell confronts the difficult issue of Donne’s misogyny head-on. In his Paradoxes, Donne pushed arguments to often ludicrous limits, comparing women to “fleas sucking our very blood”. Rundell doesn’t diminish the repellence of these, but she also points out that the absurdity is the point – he may even have been taking on the arguments of others and demonstrating their nullity. She doesn’t want Donne to be perfect; this is a poet who dazzled in making perfection out of imperfection. And the misogyny of his prose doesn’t negate the expansive equality of his best erotic poetry – his belief, as Rundell puts it, that you can find “eternity through the human body of one other person”. Eternity, in its particular manifestation as infinity, is Rundell’s central theme. This is a determinedly deft book, and I would have liked it to billow a little more, making room for more extensive readings of the poems and larger arguments about the Renaissance. But if there is an overarching argument, then it’s about Donne as an “infinity merchant”. In embracing infinity, he turned eternity into a mathematical concept, and there is pulsing excitement to his quest for this quality, which runs through his writing about sex, death and God – his three great subjects. To read Donne is to grapple with a vision of the eternal that is startlingly reinvented in the here and now, and Rundell captures this vision alive in all its power, eloquence and strangeness.

4/28/2022,"Environmental activists have sabotaged petrol pumps at two motorway service stations, in what they described as a “significant escalation” in their campaign against fossil fuel distribution in England. About 35 supporters of the Just Stop Oil campaign staged blockades at the Cobham services in Surrey and the Clacket Lane services in Kent, both on the M25, smashing the display glass on petrol pumps with hammers and defacing them with spray paint. The action against new fossil fuel targets came after the companies controlling the fuel terminals that had previously been targeted obtained civil injunctions banning protests at their sites. The activists struck at the two motorway services at 7am. A video from one site showed a campaigner using a small window-breaking hammer to smash the glass on one pump, and spraying the broken dial with orange spray paint. “Today’s action is a significant escalation after 10 Just Stop Oil supporters were arrested yesterday outside Kingsbury oil terminal [in Warwickshire] whilst standing peacefully on a grass verge with placards,” the campaign said in a statement. “Since 1 April, when supporters of Just Stop Oil first began blocking oil terminals, there have been over 1,000 arrests. The supporters of Just Stop Oil will continue the disruption until the government makes a statement that it will end new oil and gas projects in the UK.” The activists arrested at Kingsbury were due to appear in court in Birmingham on Thursday charged with contempt of court, and face up to two years in prison and the possibility of an unlimited fine. More injunction-breaking protests were planned later. Just Stop Oil’s protests have been blamed for fuel shortages at petrol stations around the Midlands and south-east England, infuriating ministers and some motorists. On Wednesday, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, promised the government would “stop at nothing” to prevent such protests, and said fuel distribution had not been significantly affected. Despite the disruption, and negative coverage from rightwing papers and broadcasters, Just Stop Oil said their protests were encouraging others to take action over the climate crisis. According to new polling, the proportion of people in the UK who said they were likely to engage in some form of climate action increased from 8.7% to 11.3% in the first three weeks of their campaign, equivalent to about 1.7 million adults. Climate action included talking to friends and family about the climate crisis, contacting their MP about climate issues or attending a legal protest. Results also showed that 58% of UK adults supported the demands of Just Stop Oil, with only 23% against and 19% neutral. However, only 18% supported the group itself. James Ozden, director of Social Change Lab, which commissioned the research, said “We’ve heard many people speculating that the disruptive protests utilised by Just Stop Oil were damaging to the climate movement. Our survey results don’t support this, finding no loss in support for key climate policies and, instead, we find that the likelihood of the UK public taking various forms of climate action has increased in the same period.”",News/Environment,Just Stop Oil protesters sabotage petrol pumps on M25 motorway,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/28/just-stop-oil-protesters-sabotage-petrol-pumps-on-m25-motorway
4/28/2022,"A female Welsh MP has accused a member of the shadow cabinet of lewd sexism by stating she would be successful because men wanted to sleep with her. After the latest allegation of misogyny to hit Westminster, Labour promised to launch an investigation if a complaint was made. But the MP told BBC Wales that identifying herself and making a complaint was not in her best interests. She alleged that an unnamed member of Labour’s frontbench described her as a “secret weapon” because “women want to be her friend and men want to **** her”. A report of what she said she was told changed in a later version of the story to say “‘women want to be her friend’ and men want to sleep with her”. The Welsh MP said the remark was made at an event when she was praised as a “rising star” of her party. She alleged that before she could reply the shadow minister intervened with the “secret weapon” remark, and added that she was a “vote winner” because of her looks. A Labour spokesperson said: “The Labour party takes all complaints extremely seriously. They are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate action is taken.” The Women and Equalities party tweeted: “It’s no wonder violence and harassment pervades society when MPs fear reporting misogynistic behaviour more than being an actual misogynist.” The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, suggested Labour should investigate even if a complaint was not raised formally. Speaking to BBC Breakfast he said: “I have literally just heard about it as I was walking into the studio. Obviously this has to be investigated. We need to find out who these people are. I would now expect the Labour party to look into that.” He also criticised the sexist culture in the Commons. Ashworth said: “All these claims that we are hearing about – it is shocking, foul, disgusting. But it’s also utterly depressing. All these stories reveal a misogyny and there’s actually also a bullying culture in that place as well.” The Sunday Times reported that 56 MPs had been referred to parliament’s independent complaints and grievance scheme over sexual complaints, including three cabinet ministers and two shadow cabinet ministers. And on Tuesday, a Conservative MP was alleged to have been seen looking at pornography on his phone while sitting in the Commons chamber. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said: “There is no place for pornography in the workplace. It’s really that simple.” The interviewer, Mishal Husain, asked Wallace what action should be taken against the MP if the allegations was proven. Wallace replied: “I certainly think they should lose the whip.” He added: “There are a range of measures, if it is proven that measures and discipline should be administered.” He also urged witnesses to call out inappropriate behaviour. Wallace said: “I would absolutely encourage all people to come forward whether they are bullied, whether they’ve been victim of inappropriate behaviour, or indeed this type of example.” During and after the interview Wallace was criticised for repeatedly calling Husain “Martha” in a mistaken reference to another Today programme presenter, Martha Kearney. LBC producer Shivani Sharma tweeted: “Can someone tell Ben Wallace he is speaking to Mishal Husain today. He’s called her Martha twice now, whilst talking about respect for women in the workplace.”",News/Politics,Welsh female MP accuses Labour frontbencher of sexist remark,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/28/welsh-female-mp-accuses-labour-frontbencher-of-sexist-remark
4/28/2022,"The British Journal of Sports Medicine says it is investigating a body of work published by its former editor-in-chief, neurologist Dr Paul McCrory, in light of “additional allegations of plagiarism” against the world-renowned concussion expert. The peer-reviewed journal will also review the past four consensus statements published by the global Concussion in Sport Group (CISG), of which McCrory was the lead author, along with a sample of other papers on which he is the first or senior author. McCrory resigned from his role as chair of the CISG in March after the British Journal of Sports Medicine retracted a 2005 editorial, published while he was editor-in-chief, citing an “unlawful and indefensible breach of copyright” of the work of Prof Steve Haake. In the months since, he has been accused of copying material in other articles without attribution and reportedly apologised, telling website Retraction Watch that he had requested the papers in question be retracted and “the errors were not deliberate or intentional”. He has also become the subject of investigations by the AFL, for whom he is a former longtime concussion adviser, and Australia’s medical regulator. McCrory has not responded to questions about the allegations from Guardian Australia. In a statement on its website, the BJSM, which is published by the Britain-based BMJ Group, said it was prepared to take action should the additional allegations turn up further instances of plagiarism. “BMJ recently retracted ‘The time lords – measurement and performance in sprinting’, authored by former BJSM editor-in-chief Dr Paul McCrory, due to what was established by BMJ’s Research Integrity team as unlawful and indefensible breach of copyright,” the statement read. “We are aware of additional allegations of plagiarism against Dr McCrory that have since been brought forward. BMJ and BJSM take these allegations very seriously. The BMJ Research Integrity team is currently examining these allegations and will act accordingly when the investigation is complete.” McCrory, who is also an honorary associate with the prestigious Florey Institute for medical research in Melbourne, was editor-in-chief of the BJSM from 2001 to 2008. He has published hundreds of articles in journals including that publication. “The BMJ Research Integrity team is investigating all allegations as well as a sample of other papers in which he is the first or senior author,” the statement said. “We understand that Dr McCrory has resigned from his leadership position in the Concussion in Sport Group (CISG) as well as his role as part of the Scientific Committee of the International Consensus Conference on Concussion in Sport. “BJSM has published five iterations of the consensus statement from these consensus conferences (Vienna 2001, Prague 2004, Zurich 2008, Zurich 2012, Berlin 2016). Dr McCrory is first author on the latter four statements. “These will also be reviewed by the BMJ Research Integrity team. Whether Dr McCrory’s actions affected the content of prior statements is the purview of the Scientific Committee appointed by CISG.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The CISG is an international body of experts who have met every four years since 2001 to provide sporting codes around the world with blueprints on how to manage head injury, and is funded by the International Olympic Committee, Fifa and World Rugby among others. The consensus statements it produces have been used to inform the concussion management policies of professional leagues including the NFL, World Rugby and the AFL, and is responsible for developing the standardised SCAT5 tool used by doctors to evaluate head injuries in athletes aged 13 and over. McCrory is the lead author of four of the five consensus statements, which have been plagued by criticism for allegedly not being informed by strong evidence. The most recent of these statements, issued in 2016, does not acknowledge “a cause-and-effect relationship” between repeated concussion or sub-concussive impacts and the neurodegenerative disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Last year a group of academics, researchers, clinicians and carers argued the CISG’s consensus statement process has consistently underplayed the risks. McCrory has been a high-profile public spokesperson about concussion in sport globally. He has also on multiple occasions expressed doubts over the relationship between concussion and CTE, and his resignation has prompted questions about the quality of evidence behind some concussion policies. Earlier in April the AFL announced that senior lawyer Bernard Quinn QC would lead an independent review into concussion advice and medical research provided to the league and its players by McCrory.

A study published in the Journal of Concussion by researchers in Canada analysed the most widely cited concussion consensus statements and guidelines, finding they were not informed by strong and well-designed clinical trials, known as randomised control trials. The researchers included in their analysis those four CISG concussion in sport consensus statements authored by McCrory. “There remain many unanswered questions about how concussion can best be prevented, diagnosed, managed, and treated,” the authors of the analysis wrote. “A review of widely-cited concussion consensus statements demonstrates that best practice in concussion management is still largely informed by moderate-level evidence … calls for further high-quality evidence have been made in order to form definitive clinical guidelines.” A separate study led by Monash University in Melbourne published in April found the brains of amateur Australian rules footballers are still recovering two weeks after receiving a concussion. The study, published in the journal Sports Medicine Open, adds to growing concern that sports-related concussion guidelines that allow players to return to competition 11 days (NRL) or 12 days (AFL) after they have been concussed may be inadequate. Associate Prof David Wright, from the university’s department of neuroscience, used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure structural changes, oxygen consumption and blood flow in the brains of concussed male and female amateur Australian rules players. The 13 athletes in the study underwent the MRIs after being cleared to return to play following the mandatory 12-day recovery period. They were compared to a group of 16 control group Australian footballers who had not had a sports-related concussion for the previous three months or more. Despite the recently concussed Australian footballers being cleared to play, the study found evidence that the athletes’ brains had not yet fully recovered. “We found evidence of residual injury in the white matter of the brain as well as a trend for reduced blood flow in the brains of those who had had a recent concussion and been deemed fit to return to play,” Wright said. White matter changes and repeated head injury have been linked to the development of mental illness and an increased risk of suicidal ideation. White matter degradation has also been seen in athletes with no other conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes, that might explain it, as in the case of the late AFLW player Jacinda Barclay. A joint article written by neuropathologists and neuroscientists, published in the Medical Journal of Australia following McCrory’s resignation from the CISG, said: “McCrory’s downfall has cast doubt over international consensus guidelines for the management of head injury in sport, and focused a bright light onto conflicts of interest in sports medicine within elite/professional sports”. A co-author of the article, La Trobe University neuroscientist Associate Prof Alan Pearce, said although the AFL had announced a review of McCrory’s concussion work and medical advice, attitudes around concussion still needed to change. Pearce, who has previously spoken of his difficulties with the AFL when he tried to study the impact of concussion on former players, said it was now clear the resolution of symptoms was not enough to clear a concussed player to return to the field. More rigorous research was needed and should be funded to better understand what concussion recovery looks like, he said.",Sport/Sport,New investigation into allegations of plagiarism against concussion expert Paul McCrory,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/28/new-investigation-into-allegations-of-plagiarism-against-concussion-expert-paul-mccrory
