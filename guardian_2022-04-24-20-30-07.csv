4/24/2022,"The village of Rickleton, near Sunderland, is a scene of quiet suburban bliss on a warm April morning. But the sound from the cricket field of leather on willow has been disturbed by frantic electioneering before a vote that could spell danger for the Labour leader, Keir Starmer. Labour has ruled Sunderland with an iron grip for decades but the recent political upheaval has left it clinging to power. The party has a majority of only six councillors, meaning it could lose overall control of the council next month for the first time since it was founded in 1974. Starmer has visited the city twice in recent weeks in a bid to avert a disaster that would undermine what could be a strong set of local elections for Labour across England on 6 May. Rickleton is representative of Labour’s struggle outside the big cities. The former mining village, 10 miles west of Sunderland, has been core Labour territory for generations. But last year it broke with tradition and elected a Conservative councillor, one of six voted in across the city on a night when Labour lost nine seats. This year, the council leader’s own seat is up for grabs, and the Tories are eyeing what would be a major scalp. “I think everybody’s ready for a change now,” said Linda Delaney, walking her 12-year-old springer spaniel, Olly, on the playing fields where Harraton colliery once stood. Delaney, 69, said she would vote Conservative because she felt Labour had taken people for granted and misused money locally: “I think they could do with a reality check.” As she spoke, Boris Johnson was repeating his apology to MPs for breaking lockdown laws in June 2020. The Partygate saga has helped Labour to a six-point poll lead nationally and appears to be putting off some would-be Tory voters fromturning out at all. One Labour figure said they had encountered many Labour-Tory switchers from 2019 planning to stay at home on 6 May, rather than return to Labour. “There’s a big poll lead nationally and we are getting a hearing again, but I’m still not sensing that love on the ground,” he said. For Antony Mullen, the 30-year-old leader of the Sunderland Conservatives, out canvassing in the Barnes area of the city on Wednesday, the prime minister risked derailing what could have been a big night for the party in north-east England. “It’s going really good. I’m just worried that something else might happen nationally,” he said. Mullen, who has previously called for Johnson to resign, believes the prime minister’s days are numbered: “I think he’s done for. I don’t think he’ll be leading us into the next general election.” Seventeen of the seats up for grabs in Sunderland are held by Labour. Seven of those are occupied by Labour councillors stepping down, taking with them almost 70 years of council experience. “Jumping before they’re pushed, some of them,” said one Labour councillor. The Conservatives, meanwhile, are aiming to build on the gains that have seen the party go from six councillors in 2015 to 19 today. The party took nearly 24,000 votes across the city’s three constituencies in the 2015 general election. In 2019, that had almost doubled to 40,685 votes, slashing Labour’s majorities to about 3,000 and making Sunderland a key battleground in the next national poll. Three recent council byelections have given Labour hope of survival in Sunderland. The party gained a former Ukip seat in March and took two seats in neighbouring County Durham, including one from the Conservatives last week. The former Labour councillor Iain Kay, who lost his seat four years ago but is standing for election again, said there had been a “big step forward” from recent campaigns: “The last few years have been brutal. The outright unbridled unfriendliness has been tangible. This year I’ve not had one single negative response and a lot of people are reporting that.” After decades of stagnation and failed projects, there have been signs recently of progress in Sunderland. New arts studios and cultural spaces have opened, including a live music venue inside a former fire station; hotels and office blocks have sprung up on the skyline. Only last month, the council officially opened its gleaming new headquarters, City Hall, on the banks of the River Wear, a building it is renting for £2.4m a year. The eye-watering cost – double the annual spend on sports and leisure – has irked voters facing the biggest fall in living standards since the mid-1950s. While Labour still holds 43 of Sunderland’s 75 council seats, a loss of six councillors would take the town hall into no overall control for the first time in 48 years. Paul Edgeworth, a Lib Dem councillor, said there had been “no conversations” with the Tories about forming a coalition but that they would be willing to work together on “basic services issues”. There is potential, however, for Partygate to help Labour cling on. Marilyn Henderson, a former NHS physiotherapist, said she had always voted Labour but switched to the Conservatives in 2019 owing to the “shambles” under Jeremy Corbyn. The 75-year-old remain voter said she would not vote for Starmer’s party this time but that Johnson’s rule-breaking had put her off voting for the Tories. “Nationally there’s so many ridiculous things going on,” she said. “It really is awful and it has upset so many people.”",News/UK news,‘Everybody’s ready for a change’: Labour losing grip on Sunderland,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/24/labour-sunderland-local-elections-conservatives-partygate
4/24/2022,"Drums, flutes and the tramp of marching feet resounded across Northern Ireland last week in the latest round of protests against the protocol which imposes checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea as part of the Brexit deal. On Thursday, they paraded in Castlederg, on Friday in east and north Belfast, and on Saturday night they were due in Derry, columns of loyalist order bands, unionist politicians, activists and citizens, marching behind union jacks proclaiming their Britishness. Such parades begin before dusk and climax with speeches as night falls, as if to match warnings of creeping political oblivion. Northern Ireland will hold an election for the Stormont assembly on 5 May, which many marchers consider a proxy battle not just for the protocol but Northern Ireland’s position in the UK. They fear the state’s existence, and with it their culture and identity, is in jeopardy. Promises from Downing Street last week to “reform” the protocol and delay border checks did not assuage unease – unionists feel they have heard it before. If polls are accurate Sinn Féin will emerge as the biggest party, positioning Michelle O’Neill to become first minister and the region’s first nationalist leader. For the protesters this will be an unprecedented affront that could further grease the slide into a united Ireland. Sinn Féin, after all, seeks to dissolve Northern Ireland. The party shuns even its name, instead referring to “the north”. The demographics fuel unionist anxiety; Catholics are expected to soon outnumber Protestants. Defiance pervades the protests, which have rumbled for a year. One of the biggest was held this month in Lurgan, County Armagh. Billed as a show of strength with invitations to 60 bands and more than 10,000 participants, the marchers tramped down roads with royal names typical of towns founded by Protestant settlers in the 17th century. “We’re still under European rule and we’re British citizens,” said Andrew Hamill, in a bowler hat and sash, as drums began to pound. “It’s the slippery slope to a united Ireland. Anything is possible.” Scott Wilkinson, 25, bedecked in badges commemorating Ulster regiments in the first world war, said Boris Johnson’s government had betrayed their sacrifice. “It’s like the middle finger to them. They fought so we could be as one.” England, he said, seemed to not care about unionists. “They’re trying to say goodbye to us even though we want to be part of them. It’s very upsetting.” As speakers mounted the podium, temperatures dropped close to freezing. The audience stamped feet for warmth. “Our demand is simple, we want full and equal citizenship within our own country, something that has been denied to us by this protocol,” Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) leader and MP, told the crowd. “Until the protocol is removed we will not see a functioning executive at Stormont because democracy must prevail.” Jim Allister, the gravel-voiced leader of Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), a small, rightwing rival to the DUP, said Northern Ireland was marooned from the rest of the UK. “The choice is simple, we either kill the protocol or it kills the union,” he said. Jamie Bryson, a young loyalist firebrand, called the protocol “a devil’s pit”. Roy Ferguson, president of the Apprentice Boys of Derry, invoked the 1689 siege of Derry when Protestants repelled the Catholic forces of King James II. “To preserve our faith, to preserve our culture, to preserve our heritage, we must win this battle,” he thundered. “The blood of our forefathers still flows in the veins of the Ulster Protestant today.” Ferguson surveyed the crowd and jabbed a finger. “This evening the people of Ulster, the grassroots Protestants, have spoken!” The assertion hung in the night air, hollow and ridiculous. The Protestants of Lurgan and the rest of Northern Ireland had indeed spoken, eloquently, by not turning up. Perhaps 1,000 people stood before Ferguson, a small fraction of the envisaged 10,000, and even that would have been a feeble echo of the flag protests a decade ago and the vaster throngs that protested against the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. The Lurgan event might have passed largely unnoticed except for a controversy over a noose drawn on a poster of the Ulster Unionist party leader, Doug Beattie, who boycotts such rallies, deeming them irresponsible rabble-rousing. Rallies like this have become a familiar ritual, usually drawing between a few dozen and a few hundred people. This does not stop podium orators proclaiming mobilisation and momentum, as if rhetoric alone could conjure multitudes. Their absence reflects a curious phenomenon unfolding within unionism. Northern Ireland is on the cusp of an election with potentially momentous implications for the protocol, power-sharing and the Good Friday agreement. Yet jeremiads about the imperilled union draw only paltry crowds. Two realities are playing out simultaneously. Those virulently opposed to the protocol have kept the issue centre-stage with denunciations and, in some cases, threats of violence. Last month an Ulster Volunteer Force bomb hoax forced the evacuation of Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, from an event in Belfast. The Ulster Defence Association, another paramilitary group, said it, too, will target the Irish government. The countdown to a possible Sinn Féin election breakthrough underscores a perception of Northern Ireland unionists as a lost tribe adrift from history, much like Algeria’s pieds-noirs French settlers. This evocative narrative ignores the fact that most pro-union people in Northern Ireland are not marching or suffering existential angst. They may not want the protocol or a united Ireland but neither issue keeps them awake at night. In surveys they express a desire for a stable, functional society and wish their politicians would stop banging on about constitutional issues. They may chafe if O’Neill becomes first minister but are confident Northern Ireland will remain in the UK for the foreseeable future. This sentiment came across forcefully in interviews with moderate pro-union voices from different backgrounds. For all the convulsions in unionist politics, they said, the union feels solid. The protocol continues to cause headaches for some companies but ordinary people no longer see the shortages and empty shelves of a year ago, said Linda Ervine, who manages the Turas Irish language project in east Belfast, which is attended mainly by Protestants. “People are just getting on with their lives. Nothing terrible has happened. We’re being told continuously that we’re being shoved into a united Ireland, that we’re losing our identity, but we look around and we’re not really seeing it.” James Wilson, a County Derry-based researcher and historian who served in the British army, agreed. “The average punter in Northern Ireland doesn’t see the manifestation of the protocol.” Farmers and business owners were quietly adapting to the protocol’s pros and cons, while ducking out of the region’s polarising politics, he said. “The protocol is a process to be worked at. Where there’s a will there’s a way.” A recent Institute of Irish Studies-University of Liverpool/Irish News opinion poll found that unionist voters ranked the economy and health care as priorities ahead of the protocol. They can focus on bread-and-butter issues because a referendum on a united Ireland, let alone a vote in favour, seems beyond the horizon. Brexit has not produced a clamour to end partition. The same poll found that just 33.4% of people in Northern Ireland would vote for unification within 15 years. That support fell to a quarter if a united Ireland meant higher taxes or paying for healthcare. This hard-nosed caveat deterred even a fifth of Sinn Féin voters. The poll found that three-quarters of people wanted the next Stormont executive to prioritise jobs, health and welfare over constitutional issues. People are not waking up thinking about Irish unity, O’Neill conceded. Sinn Féin has duly muted its demands for a border poll and focused on the cost of living and healthcare. The same poll gave Sinn Féin 27% of first preference votes, well ahead of the DUP on 20%. The centrist Alliance, which shuns orange and green labels, was third on 11%. Smaller nationalist and unionist parties accounted for most of the rest. “We have this weird situation where votes for unionist parties are going down but support for the union is stable,” said Peter Shirlow, director of the Institute of Irish Studies. Conversely, Sinn Féin may make a symbolic electoral breakthrough amid tepid support for a united Ireland. There is a disconnect between unionists and unionist parties. Most pro-union voters favour marriage equality and abortion rights, while unionist parties are more socially conservative, said Shirlow. Fewer now seem willing to hold their nose and vote DUP to keep out Sinn Féin, even if that means getting O’Neill as first minister. They have lost some fear of the republican bogeyman and know that under power-sharing the first minister has identical power to the deputy first minister, a post O’Neill held before, so her elevation would be purely symbolic. Ian Marshall, an Ulster Unionist candidate in County Tyrone who served in the Irish Senate, said a functional executive would help secure the union, no matter who was first minister. “People who are pragmatic and who believe Northern Ireland must work will just get on with it. When you’re a democrat you can’t pick and choose. If that’s the will of the people, that’s the will of the people.” But this is Northern Ireland. A growing desire to put solution-oriented governance ahead of the constitutional question does not signal an imminent outbreak of political normality. In fact, that desire is likely to get shredded in the buzz-saw of zero-sum tribalism. Most people will still vote for parties that are orange or green, and those parties’ leaders tend to drive power-sharing into a ditch, most recently in February, when the DUP withdrew. The 1998 Good Friday agreement locked nationalist and unionist parties into a loveless marriage at Stormont. The DUP and Sinn Féin, in particular, have made a habit of brinkmanship and grandstanding until they find it convenient to walk out, toppling the institutions until negotiating more favourable terms to return. The resulting vacuums have made Stormont synonymous with dysfunction and unaccountability. After votes are counted on 6 May, power-sharing may yet again freeze up. Donaldson has refused to say if the DUP would serve in an executive with a Sinn Féin first minister, raising the spectre of a stalemate that could cripple Stormont indefinitely, requiring direct rule from London. “It’s part of the process of emerging from a long, bitter conflict,” said Wilson, the historian. “We’re not yet a post-conflict society, we’re getting there. You have these jagged edges, it’s not a smooth transition.” Instead of the doom-laden visions of a “devil’s pit”, or the shiny hopes of a non-sectarian society, Northern Ireland seems poised to bumble on through its strange limbo, not British enough for some, not Irish enough for others, its eventual destination unclear. It’s messy and unedifying and a damn sight better than the awfulness known as the Troubles. 1 Unionists formed the Ulster Volunteer Force, a Protestant militia, in the north of Ireland in 1913 to oppose the British government’s promise of self-government for the whole of Ireland. 2 In 1916 the 36th (Ulster) division fought heroically at the Battle of the Somme, earning a place in folklore as embodiments of sacrifice and loyalty to the crown. 3 The Government of Ireland Act 1920 partitioned Ireland. Six north-eastern counties, with an overall Protestant majority, remained in the UK as Northern Ireland. The 26 southern counties eventually became an independent Irish republic. 4 In January 1969 loyalists and RUC officers ambushed and beat civil rights marchers outside Derry, exposing entrenched state sectarianism. The Troubles soon flared. 5 In May 1974 unionist leaders and paramilitaries led a general strike that torpedoed the Sunningdale Agreement’s attempt to create power-sharing with nationalists. 6 In 1985 DUP leader Ian Paisley led massive protests against the Anglo-Irish agreement, which gave the Irish government a role in Northern Ireland. Margaret Thatcher faced down the protests. 7 On 13 October 1994 loyalist paramilitary groups announced a ceasefire, ending a sectarian murder campaign that had killed hundreds of Catholics. 8 In July 1995 Orange Order marchers clashed with police at Drumcree, a test of strength the police eventually won. 9 In 1998 the Ulster Unionist party leader David Trimble persuaded most unionists to back the Good Friday Agreement. 10 In May 2007 Ian Paisley led the DUP into a power-sharing executive with Sinn Féin. 11 March 2021 loyalist paramilitary groups renounced support for the Good Friday Agreement in protest at the Irish Sea border imposed under the terms of the Brexit deal protocol.",News/UK news,The march of time: unionism braced for an election that could put Sinn Féin in power,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/24/the-march-of-time-unionism-braced-for-an-election-that-could-put-sinn-fein-in-power
4/24/2022,"A review of the long-term outcomes for children treated for gender dysphoria is being drawn up by ministers, following warnings over how little is known about children who later regret the treatment. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, wants to hand new legal powers to an existing review into NHS gender identity services for children, granting it greater access to crucial data on the experiences of patients who have undergone treatment. A review led by Dr Hilary Cass, a former president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, has already published an interim report that identified a lack of “routine and consistent data collection” within the Gender Identity Development Service (Gids), which oversees the services in England and Wales. Her report warned that a lack of data meant it was “not possible to accurately track the outcomes and pathways that children and young people take through the service”. Allies of the health secretary have told officials that he wants to change the way services are offered, having become concerned by Cass’s interim finding that some staff felt “under pressure to adopt an unquestioning affirmative approach” to children who expressed concerns about their gender. The health secretary is said to believe that the current system is failing children, according to a report in the Times. The newspaper also said that Javid compared the political sensitivities over gender dysphoria to the claims of racism that accompanied revelations of grooming of children in Rotherham. However, there were calls yesterday for Javid to avoid “scaremongering” over gender dysphoria. Gids is based within the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, with clinics in London, Leeds and Bristol. The service says it is very rare for patients to later regret taking puberty-blockers and less-reversible hormone treatments, but other experts say that there are no comprehensive studies on the issue. David Bell, a former consultant psychiatrist and staff governor at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust who has raised concerns about treatment at Gids, said: “There has been no follow-up of the patients, so there is no data. As Javid has said, we need to find out what happens to these children. “He likens it to the situation in Rotherham, which at first seems a strange comparison to make. But when one thinks about it, he has made an important point. “The comparison here is that fears of being seen as transphobic, like fears of being seen as racist, have certainly interfered with the capacity of professionals to properly investigate this phenomenon.” Lui Asquith, director of legal and policy at the transgender and gender-variant charity Mermaids, said affirmative care was “not at odds with exploration and that exploration should always be without expectation”. They added: “Some young people are trans, and some of them need puberty blockers to be comfortable and able to engage properly in life. That process needs to be informed and timely – just as you’d expect with any area of healthcare. Scaremongering around trans healthcare is unhelpful and, instead, we call for understanding and respect.” A spokesperson from the charity Stonewall said: “What is important is that children and young people are listened to and that they are at the heart of decision-making, supported by their families and clinicians. These treatments must be based on the best possible data, and draw from global medical expertise and consensus rather than rhetoric or fearmongering. The Cass review is an in-depth, expert-led review that is already well under way and due to report later in the year, and so an additional review would be an unnecessary, kneejerk intervention.” Labour sources suggested that the government was effectively re-announcing an inquiry that was already progressing. Senior figures said the government was trying to use “culture war” issues to distract from the rising cost of living and questions around Boris Johnson’s leadership. A spokesperson for the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust said: “We agree that support should be holistic, based on the best available evidence, and that no assumptions should be made about the right outcome for any given young person. At Gids, we take a young person’s sense of themselves seriously. Some may refer to this approach as ‘affirmative’. However, being respectful of someone’s identity does not preclude exploration.”",News/World news,Sajid Javid plans review of impact of gender dysphoria treatment ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/sajid-javid-plans-review-of-impact-of-gender-dysphoria-treatment
4/24/2022,"Congress is divided on just about every issue but a recent bill passed in the House of Representatives showed that there is at least one area that our representatives from both sides of the aisle can agree on: retirement savings. Of course, it’s no secret that people aren’t saving enough for retirement. A recent survey from the Federal Reserve found the median amount of savings in Americans’ retirement accounts was only $65,000. Another study from the Insured Retirement Institute’s data found that an estimated 33% of workers are saving less than 5% of their income for their retirement and 25% of Americans have no retirement savings at all according to a report from accounting firm PWC. The Wall Street Journal warns that a generation of Americans is entering old age the least prepared in decades and, according to the Government Accountability Office, about half of households age 55 and older have no retirement savings at all. So … enter Washington, with two bills aimed at addressing this issue. The most recent of these bills is called the Securing a Strong Retirement Act and it recently passed the House by a margin of 414-5. It builds on 2019’s Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement. Both bills are referred to as the Secure Act 1.0 and Secure Act 2.0. The original Secure Act 1.0 kind of fell under the radar due to its passage so close to the Covid outbreak. But it includes many incentives for small businesses to help their employees save for retirement. Among those incentives are tax credits to pay for half of the costs to start a 401(k) plan for employers with fewer than 100 employees, an additional tax credit for making existing plans require automatic enrollment, a pushing back of the age where distributions from a retirement plan are required to 72 (allowing older employees to work longer), the ability to include more part-time employees in a retirement plan and tax incentives to allow the distribution of funds from 529 Education Plans for student loan repayments. The bill also expanded the availability multi-employer plans so companies could share administrative expenses. So popular was the first bill that a version 2.0 bill from the House is now making its way to the Senate, where bipartisan approval is also expected, after a few minor changes. This bill adds even more retirement incentives for both businesses and employees including a 100% reimbursement of 401(k) plan startup costs to employers through tax credits, a further increasing of the minimum distribution age to 75 and now a requirement to automatically enroll new employees in a company’s retirement plan (they can still opt out) with contributions increasing from 3% to 10% over seven years. The new bill also establishes a “retirement savings lost and found” national online database for people who may have lost track of their participation in a retirement plan. It also allows more distributions from retirement and after-tax plans like Roth IRAs to help victims of domestic abuse and other hardships. Is all of this really needed? Some experts, like Andrew G Biggs at the American Enterprise Institute, makes a strong case for why the media’s retirement “crisis” is overblown. And maybe it’s not a retirement “crisis” but it’s certainly a problem. The Secure Act 2.0 will still benefit both employees and employers. To me, it’s a no-brainer – a low-cost regulation that strongly encourages people to do what they should be doing and that’s being financial prudent. I believe we’ll see passage of this bill by the Senate and signed legislation this year, all with significant bipartisan support. That’s because – as most small business owners will agree – this is one of those bills that’s pretty tough to oppose.",News/Business,Retirement savings reform is a good idea that both parties can get behind,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/24/retirement-savings-reform-congress-bipartisan
4/24/2022,"Susan and Norma meet while working in a haberdashery shop in small-town Leicestershire in the 1990s. The pair hit it off instantly, so Susan is surprised when the owner, who also happens to be Norma’s mother, assures her they’ll never be true friends. As it turns out, awkward, single-minded Norma is there to exploit Susan’s literary acumen. She’s studied geology as an undergrad and is keen to switch to the arts for her masters; handily, Susan is a year into her own degree in English literature. While it seems destined to be forever shaped by its lopsided, transactional beginnings, they do indeed strike up a friendship, one that will endure for the next 30 years, its ebbs and flows shaping Nina Stibbe’s new novel as the women navigate marriage, motherhood and ambition. It’s a departure from the trilogy that followed her autobiographical debut, Love, Nina, but there remains much here that’s pleasingly familiar, from its regional backdrop and period detail to its gossipy bookishness, which runs to Ian McEwan’s theft of pebbles from Chesil Beach and a cameo for a certain “Margaret A”. Above all, there’s the voice: idiosyncratic and droll, bittersweet and clear-eyed. Susan – never Sue (“I’m like Susan Sontag in that respect,” she deadpans) – is the narrator. Talking is her way of coping with anxiety, yielding a richly digressive text with ample comic insights into everything from revenge (her brother uses his unfortunate wife as “a weapon with which he could punish the world for not respecting him the way it should”) to the difficulty of “nice” people (you always have to wonder if they “secretly despise you or feel bitterly jealous or just think you common but want someone to go to the cinema with”). It’s notable that the haberdashers where the women met was called The Pin Cushion, a role that life seems intent on foisting upon Susan. Early on, she’s compelled to drop out of university. While Norma, who remains an enigmatic figure, goes on to have a glamorous academic career, Susan finds herself with a husband and child, yearning for nothing loftier than a pine front door (theirs is plastic) and a vegetable medley (she’s married a man who’ll eat only iceberg lettuce and baked beans). Though Susan’s narrative style occasionally finds the novel ambling down cul-de-sacs (suburban dogging being one), Stibbe succeeds in depicting a character who truly evolves over the years. It’s not the crisply choreographed stuff of the classic bildungsroman, but instead a more gradual development driven as much by middle-age’s irascibility and impatience as by youthful dreams. Eventually, an administrative job at the local university (its motto provides the novel’s title) gets her once again within reach of the life that might have been hers. If ever there were a time for reading Stibbe, it’s surely now. Not for nothing was her last novel titled Reasons to Be Cheerful. And yet while comparisons with Alan Bennett, Sue Townsend or even Victoria Wood remain apt, Stibbe applies her own darkly distinctive touches. In the grandest house in town, for instance, the only comfort comes from the distant rumble of lorries on the bypass. Its largely ridiculous owner is memorable for an ability to imitate a crying baby, leaving Susan wondering whether he’d simply never stopped. It was “authentic and haunting and somehow tragic”, all words that are applicable to the quirky, absurdist world created here. Whereas Stibbe’s previous novels confined themselves largely to the past, One Day I Shall Astonish the World takes the reader up to the year 2020, via hashtags, gender-neutral pronouns and, of course, Covid. It’s here that its tone falters, albeit momentarily. It’s a measure of her skill as a writer that she manages to save the novel. After all, her heroines are used to having, for one reason or another, their prospects restricted, so it’s perhaps no surprise that when faced with lockdown, Susan should at last come into her own, breaking into print in her 50s just like Stibbe herself.

4/24/2022,"At one o’clock on a Thursday lunchtime there’s not a seat to be had in the Canal Bar at the Creighton Hotel in Clones, up near the border in the midlands of Ireland. Regular couples and groups of old friends have got here early for the blackboarded specials, the beef stroganoff or the Easter roast beef and are already on to sponge pudding. The Creighton is a grand Victorian railway hotel that lost elements of its stateliness when the railway station at Clones closed in 1957. Patrick McCabe, the novelist, creator of The Butcher Boy 30 years ago, grew up in a terrace of houses just along the street from here, and at 67 is old enough to remember the days when the maitre d’ at the Creighton greeted you at the portico with a carnation in his buttonhole. After many years living away, in London and on the coast at Sligo, the novelist again lives close enough to the hotel that when, after driving the couple of hours up from Dublin, I call him to tell him I’m in the Canal Bar, he wanders in, a big grin behind his beard, a couple of minutes later. In the pantheon of storied Irish writers – Joyce in Dublin, Yeats on the west coast – McCabe has a special place as the conjuror of the small-town middle. His second novel, Carn, recreated a thinly disguised Clones. When The Butcher Boy was published in 1992, the irrepressible, murderous voice of Francie Brady established a new macabre magic realism for these provincial hinterlands. McCabe is pathologically wary of pretence. When I suggested lunch to him, he wrote back to suggest we might run to a “bacon sammidge”. Seated in the Canal Bar with pints of Guinness each, we order the specials, stroganoff for him, roast dinner for me. The occasion for our lunch is McCabe’s new book, Poguemahone, an extraordinary 600-page free verse novel, already hailed in the Observer as “this century’s Ulysses”. In the days before I met McCabe its voices had taken root in my head. The narrator, Dan Fogarty, is looking after his sister, Una, who is suffering with dementia in a hotel-cum-nursing home in Margate. The drama of the book reconstructs the world of 1970s Irish London – Soho and Kilburn in particular – which Una’s mind insists on reinhabiting. Once you get tuned to McCabe’s brilliant playful wavelength, after a couple or three pages, you find yourself at home in Aunty Nano’s famous late-night club – “the land of Ziggy Stardust and Enoch Powell and Mike Yarwood” – and spending too much time at the “premier crash pad in all of north London”, paradiso or inferno, depending on your politics. In the surreal days of 1960s “happenings”, McCabe suggests, the Irish had a head start. By way of example, he reminds me of the story of the avant garde film-maker Peter Whitehead, chronicler of the Rolling Stones. In the late 60s he came over to Dublin to make a promo film for Top of the Pops with the Irish folk band the Dubliners. He found them in their favourite bar one lunchtime. Within half an hour they had all hitched a lift on a horse and cart to start a pub crawl. Some days later Whitehead awoke in bed next to a beautiful red-headed woman he didn’t know, minus all of his camera equipment. “Back then, and still a little today, you can walk into some of those bars and be in a different dimension completely,” says McCabe. You have a sense of that possibility talking to him. He gave up drinking for 10 years, but has the odd glass now, partly intrigued by the new language of craft beers. After a couple of pints, his conversation over three or four hours moves from Philip Larkin on jazz and the importance of dancing on tables without being filmed, to the third wave of Irish folk music and the inheritability of consciousness. If McCabe has a political theory, it’s that most societies should be run by women because put two men together and after a while “they’ll just want to get drunk and wake up in Donegal”. I ask if he’s been working towards the voice of Poguemahone his whole writing life. He suggests this is literally the case and talks of the genesis of the idea of examining that distinctly Irish hippy culture in a story he read by Ian McEwan called Last Day of Summer, back in the 1970s. The Clones of his childhood gave him a powerful sense of worlds elsewhere. These were first accessed in comic books, then in an annual folk festival – “our Woodstock” – in which “the beat generation merged with the banjo”. McCabe brought those ideas with him to London, when he first came over at 17. “I wanted all the pop culture and movies and music,” he says, “but it was also when the Troubles had just broken out and your Irish voice attracted attention when you didn’t really want to attract attention.” The soundtrack of Poguemahone, King Crimson and Bowie and Roxy Music, “is still ahead of its time 50 years on”, he suggests. The other impetus for writing this book now, he says, was as a kind of personal inquiry into the nature of memory. “My father-in-law, to whom I was very close, had been afflicted with Alzheimer’s,” he says. “Pray God you never have to watch that, and because of things he was saying, the past began to merge with the present moment.” McCabe had been turning over phrases from a book of Victorian Irish melodrama and the two elements combined in his head to create the poignant voice of Una. “When you watch someone with Alzheimer’s you realise,” he says, “that we know nothing more about how the mind works than the Greeks did. DNA is another way of talking about the ghosts and goblins of the past really.” We pick over certain stories of our youth all the time, he suggests, novelists just dramatise that process. McCabe always wanted to have that power. As a kid he was so in love with the world of ink he would steal foolscap paper and pens. When The Butcher Boy came out, he was 37; he and his wife Margot Quinn, an artist, were living in London in a tiny one-bedroom flat in Kilburn with their two small daughters. McCabe had been working as a teacher, but it had come to “be a writer or don’t be writer. I wrote The Butcher Boy. I thought it was pretty funny but I didn’t think anyone in England would be interested. Who gives a fuck about a small town in Ireland?” Somehow, he says, the book got into the right sympathetic hands, found its way on to the Booker prize shortlist, became a movie. “Irish writing will never be the same again,” Roddy Doyle said. And suddenly McCabe and Quinn had a bit of money. “There was a funny thing, “ he says, with a laugh. “I was making something to eat for my girls and they had their little friend Will with them. Margot comes in all a-buzz, she’d heard this thing on the news that I was up for the Booker prize. It didn’t seem possible. And we were all shouting and screaming. And this little kid Will is sitting there. And eventually he pipes up. ‘That’s nothing,’ he says, ‘my dad’s got a huge boil on his nose.’” There have been 10 novels since then. Their gothic extremes have sometimes seemed in contrast to McCabe’s life. He and Quinn have been married for nearly 40 years. Recently they opened an art gallery in a place called Carrick-on-Shannon, but Covid put a stop to that, and they moved back here. I wonder, sitting in this same bar that his old man no doubt drank in, if he ever feels confined in Clones, hemmed in? He looks surprised. “I never had that sense of wanting to get rid of it or anything,” he says. “To me, it was more like how the writer John McGahern described it: ‘The weather of your early life.’ The world has become very homogenised, but no one sees this place like I see it.” He looks around the bar and outside, at the high street. “As a writer I have to believe in it all,” he says, “the same way you might believe in a prayer, you know.” Poguemahone by Patrick McCabe is out now (Unbound, £20)",Lifestyle/Food,Patrick McCabe: ‘You can walk into some Irish bars and be in a different dimension’,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/24/lunch-with-novelist-patrick-mccabe-the-butcher-boy-poguemahone
4/24/2022,"As a piece of film-making, this documentary is cumbersome, repetitive and ploddingly conventional – all traits that were anathema to its subject, the late Italian film composer Ennio Morricone (1928-2020), best known for his collaborations with Sergio Leone, but who also worked with everyone from Bertolucci to Tarantino. As a tribute to the man and his legacy it’s fascinating stuff. Giuseppe Tornatore, who commissioned Morricone to write the score for his 1988 film Cinema Paradiso, directs this exhaustive and fervently appreciative film, tracking the maestro’s journey from son of an itinerant trumpet player, to member of an avant-garde noise collective (“We wanted to make traumatic sounds”), to the lord of musical misrule behind many of the quirkier excesses of 60s Italian pop. All this, however, was a mere prelude to the main act of Morricone’s prolific career, as a creator of scores that could tell a story as eloquently as any screenplay.",Arts/Film,Ennio: The Maestro review – exhaustive tribute to the great film composer,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/24/ennio-the-maestro-review-ennio-morricone-documentary-giuseppe-tornatore
4/24/2022,"UK ministers are planning to appoint a hormone replacement therapy (HRT) tsar to help solve acute shortages that campaigners say are leaving menopausal women unable to sleep or work. Shortages of HRT products have led to some women buying them on the black market or asking friends to buy medicines abroad for them. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, told the Mail on Sunday he planned to tackle the problem by appointing a new HRT tsar with the role modelled on that of Kate Bingham, who successfully led the government’s Covid vaccine taskforce. An estimated 1 million women in Britain are on HRT, which comes in patches, pills and gels. It helps to relieve the debilitating effects of menopause including anxiety, hot flushes and insomnia. The shortages were raised last week in the Commons by Caroline Nokes, the Conservative MP and chair of the women and equalities committee. She said pharmacies in her constituency had completely run out of HRT, “which leaves women of a certain age … without access to the oestrogen gel, which enables us to sleep and to work competently.” Nokes told the Mail on Sunday: “You can’t help but feel that, if this was a drug used exclusively by men, they’d have sent in the army to beef up production by now.” Javid said: “I know just how much women rely on HRT and that some have been struggling to get certain medicines. I’m determined to do all I can to make sure that supplies are meeting hugely rising demand and there is equitable access. “I will be urgently convening a meeting with suppliers to look at ways we can work together to improve supply in the short and long term. “It’s also clear to me that we need to apply some of the lessons from the vaccine taskforce to this challenge, so we will soon be recruiting for an HRT supply chairperson.” Campaigners have argued that medical sexism and a lack of training means many women are left to suffer the symptoms of menopause, which also include depression and brain fog. Research has estimated that 14m working days a year are being lost to the UK economy as a result of menopausal symptoms. One in four women who experience the symptoms – many at the top of their career – consider leaving their job. HRT prescriptions in England have almost doubled in the last five years to 538,000 in December, according to recent figures. Manufacturers blame a combination of the rise in demand and ingredient supply problems for the shortages. The Labour MP Caroline Harris, co-chair of the UK menopause taskforce, which met for the first time in February, welcomed Javid’s intervention. “There are a lot of woman relying on him to improve the current situation,” she said. “We should never have been in this position.” Katie Taylor, the founder of the support group the Latte Lounge, said it was “welcome news albeit long overdue”. She added: “We’ve had messages from hundreds of women, many of whom are just absolutely desperate. They can’t get their usual prescription, so a lot of them are driving for hours to go to four, five or six different pharmacists.”",News/Society,Sajid Javid to appoint HRT tsar to address acute shortages ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/24/sajid-javid-appoint-hrt-tsar-acute-shortages-menopause
4/24/2022,"Against the Odds proves an apt title for Blondie’s first UK tour in five years. Rearranged from November due to Covid, it finally begins with an excitedly accelerated airing of the quintessential New York new wavers’ clattering 1976 debut single X Offender – yet without guitarist and co-founder Chris Stein, who announced a week before that he would miss the shows due to ill health. Andee Blacksugar is parachuted in as replacement, with ex-Sex Pistol Glen Matlock added on bass, making an even split in the six-piece line-up between young whippersnappers and august punks of yore. Neither personnel changes nor the passage of time can wash the colour out of Blondie’s bubblegum blitz fare, its mix of Manhattan trash and flash complimented by bursts of bright pop art imagery. The 76-year-old Debbie Harry – still cool as beans in big black shades, with her peroxide hair in a permanent state of wind-machine whipped voluminous distress – atonally bellows the opening lines of Hanging on the Telephone with the jerky mania of vintage Iggy Pop. It’s tricky to reconcile the one-time arthouse hipster stars of weirdo public access television show TV Party – scenes from which are broadcast on the arena’s screens – with a band who today see fit to spritz up The Tide Is High’s reggae lite with a punk-pop thrash. Mohawked lead guitarist Tommy Kessler’s OTT showpiece playing – during Atomic he tosses plectrums into the crowd mid screaming solo, and performs licks behind his head – are reason to wonder if Stein isn’t really sick but rather away playing with the Offspring in some strange cosmic mix-up. But chaos and contradictions have always reigned in Blondie, and the hits just keep coming, from Union City Blue to rousing 1999 comeback single Maria and a shattering Heart of Glass. Starting with the spooky organ of Bach’s Toccata in D Minor as Harry returns for the encore in a luminous yellow cape, the frightful gothic hip-hop of No Exit is more heebie-jeebies than CBGBs. We could probably live without Clem Burke’s second drum solo of the night. But Blondie’s store of ice-cold classics has far from run out and the show stomps to culmination with Call Me and One Way or Another – an effervescent final reminder of Blondie’s titanium-clad talent for keeping on keeping on, whatever it takes.",Arts/Music,Blondie review – the platinum-clad hits just keep on coming,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/24/blondie-review-ovo-hydro-glasgow-debbie-harry
4/24/2022,"Tyson Fury’s claims that he will retire following his sixth-round knockout of Dillian Whyte on Saturday have been greeted with scepticism by his family and the bookmakers, who believe he will be lured back by the opportunity to become undisputed champion. Speaking after retaining his WBC title, Fury told reporters that planned to become only the second heavyweight champion after Rocky Marciano to retire undefeated - with his thoughts now focused more on an exhibition bout with UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou and a cameo return to WWE wrestling.“I’ve fulfilled everything I’ve ever wanted to fulfil,” Fury told reporters. “I’m going to be the second heavyweight in history after Rocky Marciano to retire undefeated. I’ve won every belt there is to win. If this was a computer game it would definitely be completed for sure.” Pressed on potentially facing the winner of Anthony Joshua’s rematch with Oleksander Uysk this summer for the WBA, IBO, WBO and IBF heavyweight titles, he appropriating Clark Gable in saying: “I just don’t give a damn!” He insisted he planned to fulfil a promise to his wife, Paris, to call it quits. However Paris Fury believes her husband will find it hard to resist the chance to fight for all five belts. “I would like him to come out now,” she said. “He has nothing more to prove. For Tyson to keep boxing, it just seems for one reason and I know in my heart, I think the only reason that Tyson will come back is for the unification fight.” Fury’s father John expressed similar sentiments before Saturday’s contest, saying: “If AJ can win, wild horses couldn’t keep Tyson in retirement.” That view is also shared by bookmakers, who on Sunday made Fury as short as 4-11 to take part in an officially sanctioned bout before the end of 2023 - and 2-1 not to do so. For now, however, Fury claims that the next time he is likely to enter the ring will be as a WWE wrestler at SummerSlam in Nevada in July, or in Cardiff in September. Fury, who first wrestled in Saudi Arabia in 2019, added: “You might see me at SummerSlam coming up soon. I’d also love to be in Cardiff. I enjoyed it last time in Saudi Arabia. It was fantastic. We’re going to be in contact and see if we can make SummerSlam a reality.” Fury also insisted that he was willing to fight UFC champion Ngannou under special conditions in 2023: “He’s on my hit list in an exhibition fight, however he wants it. In a cage, in a boxing ring, boxing gloves, UFC gloves, we can make it happen,. I think everyone wants to see it, he’s a monster of a guy, I’m a monster of a guy so it will be a clash of the titans for sure.” “I’m not ruling out exhibitions for sure; get some of that Floyd Mayweather money.

It’s what I do best.”",Sport/Sport,Tyson Fury eyes wrestling and MMA but family suggest boxing return is likely,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/24/tyson-fury-eyes-wrestling-and-mma-but-family-suggest-boxing-return-is-likely
4/24/2022,"The Conservative MP Jamie Wallis has said “a part of me died” when he was raped, as he called for more support for victims and confirmed he intends to transition to living as a woman. Wallis, who is the MP for Bridgend, said since making a statement last month about being raped he had been contacted by a “shocking” number of men and women who had had similar experiences. “None of us, no matter who you are or what side of the House of Commons you sit on, you cannot get it right until we have an understanding of how pervasive this is,” he said, adding, “at some point we are going to have to find a way of identifying people that need … who have been through this trauma and need help”. Speaking of his own experience, Wallis said: “I met someone that I liked and things started off quite well actually. Then I was not OK with not being what I consider to be responsible and practice safety in the bedroom and so I withdrew consent and then there was … then he just decided that he was going to do it anyway and I was powerless to stop him.” He added: “In that moment a part of me died and I have been trying to get it back ever since.” Wallis said: “I tried to forget about it for a few weeks and it almost worked, almost worked but then you start getting nightmares, flashbacks, it starts occupying every one of your thoughts and you find yourself just staring off into the distance because you’re thinking about it again and that’s when I chose to get some help.” Wallis stunned colleagues last month when he published a late-night statement revealing that he is transgender, as well as the fact that he had been raped. It came hours after Boris Johnson made what some in Westminster interpreted as a transphobic joke at a private Tory dinner, saying: “Good evening, ladies and gentleman – or as Keir Starmer would put it, people who are assigned female or male at birth.” After Wallis came out as trans, Johnson praised him for his bravery. The MP said he had received support from across the political spectrum. Speaking about his gender dysphoria, Wallis said he was eight years old when he first felt discomfort with what he called “my physical characteristics”. “I think I was eight years old when I was trying to work out what this was because that would have been 1991, 1992 and there wasn’t the ready access to the internet, there wasn’t anyone else in my community at home that felt like this or that I knew about so I had no idea what it was,” he said, explaining that he had not spoken to anyone about it, and sought to repress it for many years. Confirming that he wanted to “begin the process of transitioning”, which he expected to be “challenging and difficult”, Wallis urged others not to wait so long. “You’ve got a long life, I wouldn’t wait as long as I’ve waited – I’m 37, maybe you could move a little bit quicker than that – but actually there is nothing wrong with just taking some time and discovering yourself and don’t feel rushed to pick up a label or view it in any way but when you know who you are, you are ready and you want to tell the world, there are people like myself who are waiting and we’re welcoming, we’re friendly and we’re here to help and support,” he said. He added: “It is a transition; it is a journey and I can start that journey now without worrying about being seen or what people are going to say or anything like that.”  In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support for rape and sexual abuse on 0808 802 9999 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 in Scotland, or 0800 0246 991 in Northern Ireland.

4/24/2022,"The appeal of climbing documentaries generally seems to rest on the vicarious thrill of watching maverick free spirits risk life, limb and frost-bitten extremities, all captured by heart-stopping drone camerawork. Eliza Kubarska’s film takes a slightly different approach, and as such might not chime completely with the ready-made audience whose tastes were honed by stirring adventure docs such as Free Solo. Kubarska focuses not on the climbers but on a family of Sherpas who are caught between the pull of a high-paying job leading a trio of alpinists and the cultural taboo of climbing the most sacred of their holy mountains, Kumbhakarna (or Jannu) in Nepal. In its gentle, slightly meandering way, The Wall of Shadows asks important questions – about western entitlement, and whether scaling a mountain is the same as respecting it.",Arts/Film,The Wall of Shadows review – Sherpas caught between a rock and a hard place,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/24/the-wall-of-shadows-review-nepal-sherpas-documentary-eliza-kubarska
4/24/2022,"Opposing leaders, each asserting the legitimacy of their claim to power, sling insults and threats, unleash war. In the final section of Shakespeare’s Henry VI trilogy, advantage seesaws from side to power-and-riches-grabbing side. Then, as now, whichever faction gains temporary victory, the conclusion for ordinary people remains the same: death and desolation. A pivotal scene, hardly more than a sketch, midway through the play, drives this point home. Battle rages, violent and bloody; suddenly, a moment of calm: Henry, watching the to-and-fro of the fighting, sits alone on a molehill and compares the “sweet”, “secure” life of a shepherd to that of a king, burdened with “care, mistrust and treason” (Mark Quartley’s king swithers between feyness and foolishness). His musings are interrupted. A young fighter, about to rob the corpse of the man he has just slain, discovers his own father; an older combatant, similarly about to loot a body, discovers he has killed his son. The impression of the chaos of war is the most powerful aspect of director Owen Horsley’s Wars of the Roses, one of two new RSC productions based on the Henry VI plays . Design (mud and ramps), costumes (armour, chainmail, robes), digital projections (stage battles filmed live and projected huge on to ribboned curtains), music and sound (clashing percussion and nerve-taut strings), along with performances (comradely chants, battle-weary panting, groaning of the mortally wounded) combine to emphasise the brutality and futility of violence. Spectacular as this is, it’s not enough to sustain three hours’ interest. For that, we need strong characterisations and clear delivery; too little directorial attention has been given to acting and articulation. That said, Quartley’s Henry is well balanced by Oliver Alvin-Wilson’s ambitious, intelligent, martial York, while Arthur Hughes’s Duke of Gloucester is a brilliance of intensifying evil – a wicked Richard III in the making. Wars of the Roses is at the Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 4 June",Arts/Stage,Wars of the Roses review – a little too much shock and awe,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/24/wars-of-the-roses-rsc-review-royal-shakespeare-theatre-stratford-upon-avon
