3/8/2022,"The NFL has banned Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Calvin Ridley for the entire 2022 season – and possibly longer – for betting on games. The suspension means he will forfeit his $11.1m salary for 2022. “There is nothing more fundamental to the NFL’s success – and to the reputation of everyone associated with our league – than upholding the integrity of the game,” NFL commissioner Roger Goodell wrote to Ridley, informing him of the suspension. “This is the responsibility of every player, coach, owner, game official, and anyone else employed in the league. Your actions put the integrity of the game at risk, threatened to damage public confidence in professional football, and potentially undermined the reputations of your fellow players throughout the NFL. “For decades, gambling on NFL games has been considered among the most significant violations of league policy warranting the most substantial sanction. In your case, I acknowledge and commend you for your promptly reporting for an interview, and for admitting your actions.” The NFL found that Ridley made the bets while he was away from the team after stepping away from the league to concentrate on his mental health in November 2021. The league said there was no reason to suggest Ridley had used inside information or influenced the outcome of any games. The NFL also said it was satisfied no other members of the Falcons were involved in the case. I bet 1500 total I don’t have a gambling problem In a tweet on Monday, Ridley said he had bet $1,500 on games and does not have a gambling problem. ESPN reported that Ridley’s bets included the Falcons to win. “We were first made aware of the league’s investigation on 9 February. We have cooperated fully with the investigation since receiving notice and support the league’s findings and actions,” the Falcons said in a statement. “We are moving forward in the 2022 season with the decision that was made. With the decision that was made by the NFL, any further questions on the investigation should be directed to the league office.” The earliest Ridley can apply for reinstatement to the league is 15 February 2023. ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that several teams had attempted to open trade talks for Ridley in recent weeks, but the team had been aware of the NFL investigation and had declined any offers. The 27-year-old Ridley was a first-round pick for the Falcons in 2018 and was named a second-team All Pro in 2020 after recording 1,374 receiving yards.",Sport/Sport,Falcons’ Ridley banned for season and forfeits $11m salary after betting on NFL games,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/07/falcons-ridley-banned-for-season-and-forfeits-11m-salary-after-betting-on-games
3/8/2022,"One of London’s leading independent day school has been downgraded by Ofsted after inspectors criticised some of its teaching for focusing more on social justice than subject knowledge, and a culture where “alternative opinions are not felt welcome”. The American School in London (ASL), which charges annual fees of £32,650 for older pupils, was previously rated “outstanding” but slipped two grades to “requires improvement” – just above “inadequate” – after inspection in December. Ofsted inspectors were sent in after the ASL featured in a series of newspaper articles, which reported that parents were concerned about a “woke agenda” at the school and had complained children were being “indoctrinated” in critical race theory. Most recently the Jewish Chronicle reported the school in St John’s Wood was at the centre of a row about a Holocaust Memorial Day presentation, which highlighted “outspoken” Jews of a radical leftwing background who “had no relevance to the Holocaust whatsoever”. The Ofsted report, published on the school’s website, found much to praise about the school with its first class resources and well-qualified teachers. The inspectors said the school, which teaches four- to 18-year-olds, has high expectations and “gives strong importance to equality and inclusion”. The report added: “Sometimes, however, teaching places much more weight on the school’s approach to social justice than on learning subject-specific knowledge and skills.” In lower-school social studies, inspectors pointed out that pupils “spend much time repeatedly considering identity (including analysing their own characteristics) rather than learning, for example, geographical knowledge”. The teaching of middle-school humanities, including English, also led to a focus on social issues rather than subject knowledge and skills, the report said, leaving some pupils feeling underprepared for the next stage of their schooling. And while there was praise for the extracurricular activities on offer, the report raised concerns about the school’s use of “affinity groups”, in which pupils discuss world issues, which in some cases were limited to under-represented groups. “Some parents and pupils feel that this approach is divisive when seen alongside some teachers’ stridently expressed views on social justice,” the report said The report said the school’s trustees had already taken action to deal with concerns raised around the promotion by some staff of political and partisan views and there has been a change in leadership. It concluded: “While recognising the importance of promoting equalities, a significant minority of parents and pupils told inspectors that a culture has developed where alternative opinions are not felt welcome.” “In some classrooms, teaching has not allowed for questioning or for the balanced presentation of opposing views. Leaders and trustees should ensure that teaching does not preclude tolerance of those with different views, particularly where specific partisan or political views are presented.” An ASL spokesperson said: “ASL has been rated outstanding in all of our previous inspections. This review, however, was unusual in scope and substance, with a narrow focus on some aspects of our programme. “Despite meeting 96% of the Independent School standards, our rating was downgraded two levels. We do not think this rating reflects the quality of our school or excellence of our teaching.”",News/Education,Ofsted downgrades American School in London over focus on social justice,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/07/ofsted-downgrades-american-school-in-london-over-focus-on-social-justice

3/8/2022,"There is a scene in the 2001 Channel 4 documentary Shane Warne’s English Summer in which the Australian leg-spinner is shown in the Hampshire dressing room a few minutes before play is about to begin, wolfing down an enormous plate of chips. The interviewer suggests that perhaps this is not the nutritional regimen normally associated with the world’s top athletes. “Well,” Warne replies through a mouthful of ketchup and deep-fried matter, “if I don’t have my chips, I’m not happy. And if I’m not happy, I don’t bowl well. A piece of lettuce or fruit doesn’t make you feel good, does it?” Everyone has their abiding memory of Warne as a cricketer: the Strauss ball, the Gatting ball, the Richardson ball. Well, this is mine. And in the days since the great man passed, I’ve been thinking about this little exchange a lot, and how it upends so much of what we think we know about sport. Look after your body. Take control of the little details. Top performance derives from immaculate preparation, rigorous coaching, self-sacrifice and, you know, not eating chips. According to reports from Thailand, Warne died of a heart attack at the age of 52 in his luxury Koh Samui villa on a holiday with friends, after watching Australia play in the first Test against Pakistan and having had a massage in his room. Obviously, this is no way to go, a devastating loss for his family and friends. It is also, in the grand scheme of things, and with apologies, a bleakly perfect way to go: the Youngman’s Death that Roger McGough so heartily endorsed. In a way, Warne died as he lived: unapologetically, without fear or shame, leaving a hurricane of emotions and happy memories trailing in his wake. Indeed, one of the more comforting aspects of the grieving process has been the opportunity to relive and reflect upon the immense pleasure he provided us over the last 30 years, not for selfish or pecuniary reasons but because pleasure – both the taking and the giving – simply flowed through him like blood, was indeed the entire point of the exercise. Did it feel good? If not, then what was the point of it? Whether it was chips or cricket, punditry or poker, a cheeky six over the infield or a cheeky sext in the dressing room, in a sense Warne’s entire life was based on the pursuit of tactile thrills, and so it was watching him from afar. Warne touched all the senses: the sight of his imposing frame, the fizz in the air of his hard-spun leg-breaks, the grip of a ball in his fingers, the smell of Marlboro Lights, the taste of pure fear. And of course, there was his sixth sense: the paranormal ability to intuit a batsman’s weakness, to conceive the catastrophe before he made it happen. You’ll notice that we haven’t mentioned any of his achievements yet. The Ashes wins, the 708 Test wickets, the Indian Premier League triumph with Rajasthan Royals: does any of it really matter? In a way no athlete has better encapsulated the paradox of sport and why we do it: an eternal battle between the pursuit of happiness and the pursuit of perfection. Sport as an industry worships the details, the processes, the margins: best practice, eating right, saying the right things, squeezing out every last drop of capital from your body and the world around you. It drowns us in rules and numbers, makes grand plans and strategies, never stops growing and never stops demanding. None of this felt remotely relevant to Warne. Sport for him was a human thrill ride, a vehicle of expression and emotion. It was the memories you made and the friends you collected along the way. Imperfections were there to be embraced, mistakes owned. For this he was frequently cut down to size by a public and an establishment that required the perfect bowler also be the perfect man. His improprieties were lapped up by the tabloid press. He never captained Australia in a Test match. His marriage fell apart and the scrutiny of his body occasionally made him deeply uncomfortable. Arguably there has been no more ridiculed figure in the history of cricket. And yet, for all the scrutiny and intrusion, Warne continued to choose warmth over coldness. During a Test match at Old Trafford a few years ago a friend asked if I could persuade Warne to record a good luck message for his wedding. Ha! Some chance. Still, I tentatively knocked on the door of the Sky Sports green room. Warne was having a nap. He didn’t know who I was and he didn’t know the bride and groom. But he emerged groggily in his socks and filmed a note-perfect 45-second message in a single take. He didn’t remotely mind doing it. Any opportunity to spread a little happiness. I would have loved him for that, if I didn’t love him already. I know you’re not supposed to make these things about yourself, but when an athlete connects with you on such a personal level, how can you not? I loved his talent and lust and cheek and bravado. I loved the vision of sport he embodied. I love the fact that his highest Test score was 99 and I love the chill of terror he used to send up my spine. I love that the greatest spinner of all time lived on a diet of chips. I love that he wasn’t perfect, and most of all I love that he never tried to be.",Sport/Sport,"Shane Warne died as he lived, leaving a hurricane of emotions and memories | Jonathan Liew",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/07/shane-warne-cricket-tribute-emotions-and-memories
3/8/2022,"“What if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: ‘This life as you now live it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you … Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus?” Yes, I would. I would probably do that. It becomes easier to say this with certainty, to agree with Friedrich Nietzsche’s theory of eternal recurrence – which might previously have seemed a little lateral, lacking in, say, the directness that makes the Premier League so special – having watched Sky Sports coverage of Sunday’s Manchester derby; and having seen Dave Jones turn to Roy Keane at the final whistle, with a sense even here of basic existence-fatigue and ask: “Roy. How would you sum up that half?” As the caption Roy Keane: unbeaten in all 14 derbies with Manchester City scrolled beneath his beard-line, Keane paused. Can I say that he looked tired? That behind his eyes, the great anti-bluffer knew that he too was in danger of lapsing into muscle memory and learned response. Roy didn’t fake it. He didn’t confect imaginary adrenaline. He said that United’s players basically gave up, and not much more. And by the end it felt like a moment to ask: are the great days of people saying Manchester United are bad already gone? People saying that Manchester United are bad was a glorious thing. We will always have those sunlit memories, back when people saying Manchester United are bad was fresh and new. But you have to say, we expect a bare minimum of effort, of cinematic rage and tweetable clips. Perhaps we need to dig deep and look at the whole structure of people saying Manchester United are bad. Because by this stage we have surely reached a tipping point in this fascination with the everyday decline of a poorly managed football club. Zoom out and United’s season is unremarkable. Fifth in the league, with a couple of minor cup runs: this looks about right given the squad and the coaching resources. Exactly which combination of Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Ralf Rangnick, Fred, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and an aged celebrity striker is supposed to guarantee elite-tier success? And yet the wheel of rage continues to revolve, to the extent the only really interesting thing about Manchester United right now is how unhappy people are about Manchester United. The most powerful element, the only real energy at the club, is that apparently bottomless well of dismay. It is worth noting this is not by chance. Good salespeople are endlessly adaptable. When life gives you a bad football team: make bad football team-ade. And so United’s non-success has become the product, a self-sustaining media industry in its own right. At the end of another unremarkable defeat we await impatiently the real match around the lighted coffee table, the cut-aways, the memes, the pornography of legend-rage. Gary’s rant. Micah’s laugh. Scholesy’s pucker of disdain. This is where the eyeballs are now, the clicks, the money. Done with feasting on the flesh we are now down to gnawing the bones and sucking out the marrow. What, you wonder, will be left at the end? There are two things worth saying about this. First, no useful purpose is served here. This is not good for the Premier League, or good for how we consume this thing. There is a general principle that grandiose failure is more interesting than efficient success. Stories about a non-tortured genius or unflawed heroes rarely catch the imagination. Hence Manchester City winning is harder to describe in an interesting way than Manchester United losing. Describing why and how City are good, the way a team of seven technically sublime midfielders set to a wonderfully grooved plan can always create overlaps and space: this is less grabby, less operatic. But that United obsession will also eat itself. The current mode of TV analysis is to throw a lighted circle around a player who isn’t running and say things like: look at him. He’s not running. And from there to talk about character and essence, to suggest the explanation for Manchester United not being better than teams with better players and better management is something deep and rotten, something that will, in the end, reward our fascination. In reality this is not interesting failure. It’s not grand or thwarted or pure. It is easily explained. Compare the team lists from Sunday. Is it really surprising that City should go on to win 4-1? Or that City’s method, which is designed to exhaust and demoralise, should ultimately do both to an inferior team? Run it through the computer. Simulate these known qualities. This is what you’d get. Carelessly run from the top, United have become a flaccid on-field entity, all weird succession and disjointed recruitment, with no obvious winning method among the many tiers of management blokes currently filling the gap between coach and board. At the end of which Wan-Bissaka is trying to defend against Phil Foden and João Cancelo, who are simply better players with a better plan. And Harry Maguire stands accused once again of being somehow deliberately, consciously bad. Maguire is, of course, just a symptom. Before moving to this impossibly demanding environment he had played in the Premier League 69 times for Leicester and 32 times for Hull. Aged 29, he still hasn’t won a trophy. Maybe Maguire is just good but not great – a little overexposed, but also bedraggled now, scrambled and beaten down by the extraordinary levels of ambient unhappiness, the constant dissection, the theatrical punditry rage. And this is the other thing. This loss of scale is, above all, bad for Manchester United. Take a step back and it isn’t much of a leap to conclude the rotating chorus of despairing legends may just be part of the problem. This is a club that remains in thrall to its own past, but which is still able to retail that iconography; and still able to find a market for those grave old Easter Island heads, out there feasting on the bones of the present. How much harder to move forward while every public projection is still being broadcast from the land of Fergie; and while decline and falling short, the reproaches of the glorious past, is always the story. Manchester United were great for just over 20 years. They’ve been bad for nine. How long will it take? When does angst and agony become the defining note? Why, you wonder, might those players feel their shoulders tense, the world closing in? Why do they look demoralised? We’ll be back after the break for more from the panel on that.",Sport/Football,Manchester United being bad is now its own self-sustaining media industry | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/07/manchester-united-derby-reaction-roy-keane-media
3/8/2022,"Ten weeks after ending his 16-year BBC One Sunday TV show with the words, “You stay classy, San Diego” – the sign-off of caricature presenter Ron Burgundy in the movie Anchorman – Andrew Marr signed on to his new show on LBC by hailing “a day of horror in Ukraine and growing unease here in Britain.” Anchorman fans will recall that Burgundy is fooled into reading a banned profanity from his autocue, and Marr’s publicity interviews might have led us to believe that he planned to deliberately hurl expletives at his LBC audience. The show, he promised, would “ruffle feathers”; he had left the BBC to “get his voice back” and “speak his mind.” In fact – as with Eddie Mair, an earlier LBC marquee signing from Britain’s oldest wireless broadcaster – the move so far proves that it’s easier to take the man out of the BBC than the BBC out of the man. The closest Marr got to shock-jocking by dropping a Burgundy F-bomb was repeating the term “cluster shambles” used by another contributor. One report claimed Marr moved to LBC to be more outspoken on climate change. But that makes little sense. The BBC is so onside environmentally that managers wouldn’t have blinked if Marr had fronted his TV show wearing a Greta Thunberg mask. Conversely, the tone of many LBC phone-ins suggests that the presenter known at Cambridge as “Red Andy” (politics, not complexion or football allegiance) might not be wholly welcomed as “Green Andy.” It seems more likely that he wished to be more opinionated about Westminster events. And LBC Marr was marginally less impartial than the BBC version, with a number of Tweet-like asides on news bulletins and interviews – “Big hand-brake turns coming up in British politics!” he glossed one story. “Fingers and toes crossed!” he replied when a retired ambassador predicted China was busy diplomatically with Russia. A mention of a Russian oligarch whose credit card bounced in London prompted the comment: “That was a good story that really cheered me up!” A follow-up question began: “I guess my scepticism is this.” In BBC News-speak, the last of those would be “some, though, might argue”, but if Marr was throwing away his journalistic corset, he was letting out the stays incrementally. In fairness, it was a bad start date for a broadcaster aiming to be reborn a controversialist. Such is the political consensus for Ukraine and against Russia that the only truly contentious view would be to call for a pre-emptive nuclear attack on Moscow. Marr didn’t quite go that far, but did ask his big Westminster guest, Michael Gove, if Armageddon can be avoided. The Secretary of State for Levelling Up was confident that it won’t come to global levelling-down. Gove will have been a disappointment. When they started planning the show for an early March start, Marr’s producers would have hoped to kick off with a prime minister – either Boris Johnson or his successor. But with British politics freeze-framed by Ukraine and the Metropolitan Police investigation into Downing Street parties, they had to settle for a politician who is reliably newsworthy (he seemed to signal an impending economic package for the poorest) but a very familiar news show guest. With Emily Maitlis and Jon Sopel soon to join Marr and Mair, LBC risks becoming a broadcasting Manchester United – splashing cash on signings without properly thinking about where they all fit into the lineup. And while the heavy talent traffic from the BBC clearly has symbolic power, LBC’s existing stars – Nick Ferrari, James O’Brien, Iain Dale and Shelagh Fogarty, who started the BBC diaspora long ago – have already given the station a distinctive sound. Surrounding them with Broadcasting House veterans in recovery from the licence fee (quickly done at LBC fees) and impartiality (a slower transition) risks blanding the brand – or leaving one of the star transfers as the Cristiano Ronaldo of digital political broadcasting: good for publicity but disruptive to tactics. Marr closed the first show (he will occupy LBC’s 6-7pm slot from Mondays to Thursdays), with a rebuke to Putin: “Once you start a vicious bloody war, a cascade of change follows!” He couldn’t have done that at the BBC, but the rest of the programme was pretty much his Sunday morning shtick on a Monday evening. But trails for Tuesday’s breakfast show served to suggest how far Marr has to go before reaching the spectacular forensic insolence of Ferrari. And when Marr handed over to Dale, who opened his show by promising “to pour a bucket of brown stuff over the Home Office for its cluster shambles”, there was cause to wonder if the BBC veteran can ever find that sort of voice, or what is gained if he does.",Arts/Television & radio,Tonight With Andrew Marr review – no F-bombs here!

3/8/2022,"Thousands of residents in Sydney’s south-west were ordered to evacuate overnight as heavy rain swelled rivers, with fresh flood risks for places as far apart as the Illawarra and Kempsey in northern New South Wales. The State Emergency Service has given evacuation orders for a “substantial” population in 12 Sydney suburbs, mostly in the Georges River area. Tens of thousands of people are affected. These include parts of Chipping North, Milperra, Picnic Point and Warwick Farm. The SES conducted 100 flood rescues in the 24 hours to 5am Tuesday morning. The Bureau of Meteorology issued a warning for damaging winds and heavy rain for a region stretching from near Taree on the mid-north coast almost to the Victorian border in the state’s far south. Another day, another big warning area for heavy rain, but also damaging winds: https://t.co/E0A4G0fr0O pic.twitter.com/080gtIHWPK The bureau said a low pressure system was expected to deepen and develop into an east coast low near the Hunter coast this morning and track south. It will be the second east coast low in less than a week and may bring more damaging winds than last week’s. “Heavy rainfall which may lead to flash flooding is forecast for the Mid North Coast, Hunter, Sydney Metropolitan, Illawarra, South Coast, and parts of the Central Tablelands districts,” the bureau said. “Six-hourly rainfall totals between 70mm to 120 mm are possible.” It added that totals could even reach 150mm during that period if thunderstorms developed. Importantly given the population centres, the peak of the rainfall would most likely be in the Sydney metropolitan, Illawarra and south coast districts. Sydney's rainfall forecast has been raised to 120-150mm on Tuesday. Some areas inland topped 100mm in the past 22 hours too. @BOM_au pic.twitter.com/uaI63l2s0S Of the overnight evacuations, an SES spokesperson, Shellie Smyth, said: “There was a cell that sort of moved from up north down into Sydney, and it dumped in some cases over 100mm of rain in a very short space of time into an already saturated catchment, which caused rapid river rises. Obviously we had to issue those evacuation orders.” Among areas outside Sydney facing flood risks on Tuesday were Kempsey and parts of the Illawarra and Shoalhaven areas, Smyth said.

Rivers are also at major flood level in several parts of the state, with Sydney’s flood-prone Hawkesbury-Nepean among them. “Major flooding above the March 2021 event is occurring at some locations along the Upper Nepean, Hawkesbury, and Colo Rivers,” the bureau said. “Forecast rainfall for Tuesday may cause further renewed rises.” Warragamba Dam, which has been flooding since 3am on Wednesday, is continuing to spill, with the rate quickening again overnight, bureau data showed. As of Monday evening, authorities were predicting the dam’s peak spill rate could reach as much as 400 gigalitres a day, or not far from the March 2021 peak of 440GL a day. Last week’s peak was 315 GL a day. Warragamba Dam, meanwhile, continues to spill and that rate is increasing again. @BOM_NSW #nswfloods pic.twitter.com/NtIiD9Z6Ir Along with the rain, there is damaging surf along much of the central NSW coast, and also the risk of damaging wind gusts that could bring down trees. Landslips are also a risk and motorists are advised to take care – if they have to be out on the roads at all in areas where the weather is particularly fierce. Those winds could reach peak gusts in excess of 90km/h in the Sydney metropolitan, south coast, Illawarra and southern tablelands districts, including the Australian Capital Territory ranges, the bureau said. “The risk of damaging wind gusts is expected to persist into Wednesday.”",News/Australia news,Sydney residents evacuated from homes overnight as heavy rain brings fresh flood risks,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/08/sydney-residents-evacuated-from-homes-overnight-as-heavy-rain-brings-fresh-flood-risks
3/8/2022,"Ministers may have bought 3bn protective gloves that were manufactured using modern slavery in the first year of the pandemic, MPs have been told. On Monday, officials from the Department of Health and Social Care told the public accounts committee they were investigating allegations that the gloves were produced by forced labour. Jonathan Marron, the director general of the department’s office for health improvement and disparities, said: “We have held just over 3bn gloves. We have concerns that the manufacturers may be engaged in an allegation of modern slavery, so we are investigating that. We do not obviously want to support modern slavery – that is the government’s position.” Marron said if the allegations are proven “I believe they’re contractually obligated to take gloves back and return the money”. Chris Wormald, the permanent secretary at the department, said he could not name the companies involved. Asked to clarify whether the 3bn gloves were pairs or individual items, Marron said: “We actually count individual gloves rather than pairs – I know it makes little sense.” Marron also revealed that 176 PPE contracts signed during the pandemic, worth £3.9bn, are being examined over concerns about quality or non-delivery of items. This represents almost half of all the contracts signed and almost a third of the £12bn PPE budget, MPs heard. So far, 27 of these contracts, worth more than £1bn, are now the subject of legal action, and a further 59 are the subject of “commercial discussions”, Marron told MPs. He added: “The range of issues we’ve got here are everything from non-performance and non-delivery through to problems on standards. We’re still working through what we think we can get back.” Wormald defended the way the government bought PPE during the pandemic. “We were buying in an emergency situation,” he said. “The price was what is and you have a choice between either paying that price and having the PPE or not paying the price [and not having the PPE]. There wasn’t an alternative.” He added: “If you were doing this again you would do it better.” Marron admitted that £673m worth of PPE bought during the pandemic was unusable, including counterfeit masks and aprons that were not water-resistant. But he pointed out that this represented only 3% of the items purchased. A further 10% of items have not been used because they do not meet NHS standards, he said. These have been sold or donated to schools and to other countries, the committee was told. Marron also revealed the department had bought 768m eye protectors, when the NHS only needs 6m a month. “We have not seen levels of use anything at the level that we estimated,” he said.",News/World news,UK government may have bought 3bn PPE gloves made by forced labour,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/uk-government-may-have-bought-3bn-ppe-gloves-made-by-forced-labour
3/8/2022,"The tourist cafes are behind barricades. The grand opera house is surrounded by a wall of sandbags. Tank traps block the approaches to the legendary Potemkin steps. Nobody in Odesa can quite believe that Vladimir Putin would launch an assault on this city, a place bound to Russia by family, literary and cultural ties, a place of almost mythical resonance for many Russians. But then, Putin’s armed forces have done lots of things in recent days that seemed unthinkable just two weeks ago. “I don’t know what kind of a bastard, idiot or scumbag you have to be to press the button for missiles to fall on Odesa,” said the city’s mayor Gennady Trukhanov, in an interview at a building in the centre of the city where he has moved for security reasons. “It’s beyond the limits of my understanding,” he said. On Sunday, French president Emmanuel Macron called Putin to express concerns over intelligence that an assault on Odesa would start soon. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy also referenced the possibility in one of his latest video addresses to the nation, each one delivered with increasing amounts of defiance and exhaustion. “Russians have always come to Odesa. They have always felt only warmth in Odesa. Only sincerity. And now what? Bombs against Odesa? Artillery against Odesa? Missiles against Odesa? It will be a war crime. It will be a historical crime.” So far, the Russian assault on southern Ukraine has largely spared Odesa, but military analysts suggest it is only a matter of time, especially if the Russians succeed in taking Mykolaiv, further east. Monday morning saw a renewed rocket barrage against the city, while warships have been moving ominously between the coast outside Odesa and annexed Crimea. Each morning, Odesa’s remaining residents wake up and check the progress of the warships and the status of Mykolaiv. Text messages warn them what to do in the event of an amphibious assault or a sustained airstrike. At a recently renovated food hall in the centre of the city, the stalls offering oysters, champagne and novelty coffees have not functioned since the Russian attack on Ukraine began on 24 February. Now, the hall has been decked with Ukrainian flags and anti-Russian slogans, and serves as a sorting point for donations for the army. Orange-jacketed volunteers receive bags from locals who want to help the Ukrainian effort. “We write on Telegram what we need: medicines, sleeping bags, thermal clothes. Help from the West is coming, but in these first weeks we need to help them,” said Nikolai Viknyanskyi, who runs a furniture business in Odesa and is now heading the donation drive. Each day, the centre also coordinates around 8,000 hot meals, cooked in shuttered restaurants around the city, which are distributed to soldiers and territorial defence units. The city, as every Odesan will note at the first opportunity, is a particular kind of place. It revels in its reputation as a centre of jovial swindlers and tellers of labyrinthine tales, and it has often felt more like a city-state than a centre of Ukrainian patriotism. While there has certainly been an intensified interest in Ukrainian language and culture in the eight years since the Maidan revolution, especially among young people, Odesa is still a very different place to Kyiv or cities in western Ukraine. A survey in September last year showed that 68% of Odesa residents agreed with Vladimir Putin’s statement that Russians and Ukrainians are “one people”, while only 20% of people thought the future of Ukraine was in European integration, with 38% wanting closer ties with Russia and 27% neutrality. However, the events of the past two weeks may have dramatically altered such figures. Trukhanov is a good example. Formerly a member of president Viktor Yanukovych’s Party of Regions, Trukhanov has been dogged by allegations of corruption, links to organised crime and to Russia. He denies all the allegations, and has been forced to deny repeatedly claims that he had a Russian passport. Now, he has become an unlikely champion of Ukrainian sovereignty. In response to Putin’s claim that the Russian military assault was meant to defend Russian speakers, Trukhanov posed a rhetorical question in a video address: “Who the fuck are you planning to defend here?” On Sunday, he wore the armband of yellow tape that denotes Ukrainian forces in this war over his jacket, and a grey peak cap over his permanently furrowed brow. He rubbished Putin’s claim that the war against Ukraine was one of “denazification”, and said it was Putin’s Russia that was behaving like fascists. “Bombing Kharkiv, who would do that? Only Nazis,” he said. Events in Odesa in 2014 play a large part in Russia’s narrative about a fascist Ukraine. After co-ordinated pro-Russian groups in numerous Ukrainian cities seized government buildings over the spring, Ukrainian ultras hit back against a violent pro-Russia march in Odesa. The result was a fire in the trade union building, in which 48 people died, most of them pro-Russians. The tragedy was immediately seized on by the Kremlin, who painted it as a pre-meditated, fascist massacre. In the angry televised address that presaged the current war, Putin specifically mentioned Odesa, noting that Russia knew the names of those responsible for the May 2014 tragedy and “would do everything to punish them”. The chilling words bolstered western intelligence claims that Russia has prepared lists for those to be arrested or killed in the event of an occupation. The events of 2014 drove a wedge between friends and families in Odesa. Boris Khersonsky, a 72-year-old poet, psychologist and philosopher, estimated he lost “more than half” of his friends when he decided to take a staunchly pro-Ukrainian position. “I was raised speaking Russian but after 2014 I sat down with a dictionary,” he said. Now, he writes in both Russian and Ukrainian. In light of the shocking attacks on civilians over the past two weeks, even many of those who remained staunchly pro-Russian are re-examining their convictions. Alexander Prigarin, an Odesa-based anthropologist, described his current mood as “confusion”. The events of 2014 had only strengthened his affection for Russia, he said, but the sight of Russia attacking Ukrainian cities with rockets and missiles has completely floored him. “It’s a nightmare, a tragedy, a catastrophe,” he said. Khersonsky believes the current war has brought many people in Odesa closer to patriotic Ukrainian positions. “Putin has worked hard to make that happen,” he said. In their house on the outskirts of the city, Khersonsky and his wife have turned one room into a makeshift bomb shelter, barricading the windows with piles of books to protect them from a potential Russian assault. If Russia occupies Odesa, the couple plans to leave as quickly as possible. “It’s possible that in a month we’ll have to leave this house here and become homeless refugees,” he said, matter-of-factly. Perhaps the most inexplicable aspect of Putin’s decision to invade is the idea, apparently based on a lack of understanding about how much Ukraine has changed in the past eight years, that locals in places like Odesa would welcome Russian troops with delighted cheers and bouquets of flowers. Instead, the images coming out of occupied southern cities such as Kherson have shown that however much air power Russia brings to the conflict, the endgame looks unclear. Brave unarmed Ukrainians have faced down tanks, and taken to the streets waving Ukrainian flags, with Russian soldiers looking on confused at the defiance of the people they believed they were liberating. “They can capture the city, OK, and then what? Where are the resources to create an administration, to run the city?” said Natalia Zhukova, a 42-year-old chess grandmaster and member of Odesa’s local parliament. “We will become partisans,” she said.",News/World news,‘Beyond understanding’: Odesa braced to see if Putin attacks city of such resonance for Russians,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/beyond-understanding-odesa-braced-to-see-if-putin-attacks-city-of-such-resonance-for-russians
3/8/2022,"Joe Biden attracted criticism from both progressives and Republicans after a report indicated the White House was planning a visit to Saudi Arabia to discuss global oil supply. Axios reported on Sunday that Biden’s senior advisers were considering a spring trip to Saudi Arabia in an effort to improve relations and to propose a potential increase in oil exports. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, would not confirm those plans on Monday, although she noted that senior administration officials traveled to Saudi Arabia last month to “discuss a range of issues including the war in Yemen, including security in the region and certainly including energy security”. “They had the discussion … it’s in everyone’s interest to reduce the impact on the global oil marketplace,” Psaki said. The Axios report comes as the US and its western allies consider banning imports of Russian oil in response to the invasion of Ukraine. The White House had dismissed a ban, out of concern for how it would limit oil supply and further drive up gas prices which have already hit a 14-year US high. But the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, indicated on Sunday that the west is warming to the idea of a ban on importing Russian oil. “We are now in very active discussions with our European partners about banning the import of Russian oil to our countries, while of course, at the same time, maintaining a steady global supply of oil,” Blinken told NBC. A ban on Russian oil imports would have a substantial impact on the US and allies, particularly European nations. In 2019, Russia provided 41% of natural gas imports to European Union countries. If another oil-producing nation like Saudi Arabia or Venezuela started exporting more to the US and the EU, such shipments could help fill the gap created by a Russian ban. Psaki confirmed that a group of Biden’s advisers traveled to Caracas over the weekend to meet with Venezuelan officials, but she did not indicate whether the White House would soon call for easing sanctions on Venezuelan oil. “There was a discussion that was had by members of the administration over the course of last several days. Those discussions are also ongoing,” Psaki said at a White House press briefing on Monday. “So at this point in time, I don’t have anything to predict.” But such attempts to find other oil suppliers have sparked outrage among some lawmakers. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a member of the “Squad” of progressives in the US House, accused Biden of turning a blind eye to Saudi Arabia’s alleged war crimes in Yemen. “Our response to Putin’s immoral war shouldn’t be to strengthen our relationship with the Saudis who are currently causing the worst humanitarian crisis on the planet in Yemen,” Omar said in a tweet. “Yemenis might not matter to some geopolitically but their humanity should. This is [a] wildly immoral act.” Melanie D’Arrigo, a progressive congressional candidate in New York, argued the White House should take the opportunity to transition away from fossil fuels, reducing reliance on oil-producing countries. “Transitioning away from fossil fuels means our reliance on oil wouldn’t dictate our foreign policy and force us to align with murderous human rights abusers. We can save millions of lives and our planet with a Green New Deal,” D’Arrigo said on Twitter, referring to the progressive platform to substantially reduce America’s greenhouse gas emissions. Republicans said potential outreach to Saudi Arabia and Venezuela underscored the need to increase domestic oil production. “America can easily replace #PutinOil by producing more of our own,” said Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate intelligence committee. “Instead the Biden plan is to beg Saudi Arabia to produce more, buy more from a narco terrorist #MaduroRegime in #Venezuela [and] cut a deal with the [world’s] leading state sponsor of terror in #Iran.” A Republican congressman, Carlos Gimenez, echoed Rubio, saying: “Biden’s team would rather fly to Saudi Arabia, a country with whom we have a dicey relationship, to pump more oil rather than produce more energy right here at home. Everything this administration does is just so backwards.” Boosting domestic oil production runs counter to Biden’s promises to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and help transition the US to renewable forms of energy, one piece of Democrats’ broader agenda to address the climate crisis. Some critics noted that a warmer relationship with Saudi Arabia would also contradict Biden’s promises on the campaign trail. Biden said at a Democratic primary debate in 2019 he would force Saudi Arabia to “pay the price” for the 2018 murder of a Washington Post journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, which US intelligence agencies concluded was approved by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS. “Khashoggi was, in fact, murdered and dismembered, and I believe on the order of the crown prince,” Biden said then. “And I would make it very clear we were not going to, in fact, sell more weapons to them. We were going to, in fact, make them pay the price and make them, in fact, the pariah that they are.” In an interview published by the Atlantic this month, the prince had a pointed message for America. “We don’t have the right to lecture you in America,” he said. “The same goes the other way … You don’t have the right to interfere in our interior issues.” The piece itself caused controversy. The Washington Post responded with a column under the headline ‘The Atlantic’s elevation of MBS is an insult to journalism’. The prince’s comments seemed to be a direct attack on Biden’s promise to crack down on corrupt regimes. Now, however, he and the Biden administration may be getting back into business.",News/US news,Biden criticized over report of planned Saudi trip to discuss global oil supply,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/07/joe-biden-saudi-arabia-oil-supply-criticism
3/8/2022,"A driver has been found guilty of murdering a man by hitting him with a car and dragging him for more than half a mile. Martin Eastwood, 22, used a stolen Ford S Max to kill Liam Dent in the early hours of 26 July 2019 after a confrontation outside a pub in Chessington, Surrey. The jury heard he had convictions for two previous offences involving a car including an incident in September 2018 when Eastwood drove a stolen vehicle at a cyclist, knocking him to the ground and causing him multiple fractures. Then in April 2019, he drove a stolen vehicle at a man, knocking him to the ground and causing him abrasions. Dent was dragged for half a mile at speeds of up to 32mph before landing in Moor Lane, Chessington. Jurors heard the 25-year-old victim was still alive and was able to lift his head up and move his arm, but died soon after. After a trial at the Old Bailey, Eastwood was found guilty of murder on Monday. DI Garth Hall, from Scotland Yard, said: “The actions of Martin Eastwood were callous and intentional, Liam did not stand a chance when he was struck by the car and dragged along the road to his death. “The thoughts of my team are with Liam’s family and friends today. They have finally got the verdict they have been longing for.” Detectives had been able to establish which car had been used in the attack and therefore who the perpetrator was after the Ford was found burnt out later that same night. Its telematics system was recovered, containing vital data establishing the route, speed and nature of the driving. The prosecutor, Michelle Nelson QC, said: “That data puts beyond dispute that the burnt-out Ford was the vehicle that hit Liam Dent and dragged his body to Moor Lane and the junction with Chessington Hill Road, causing his death. “It is also beyond dispute that when the Ford S Max struck Liam Dent, Martin Eastwood was behind the wheel.” Earlier in the evening, Dent had been in the Lucky Rover pub in Chessington with friends. While sitting outside, pubgoers heard offensive or threatening shouts from a Volvo, driven by Daniel Morris, with Eastwood in the front passenger seat, jurors heard. The shouts prompted some of the young men outside the pub to throw objects. Jurors heard that was the precursor for the Ford being driven at the same group, including Dent. Later that night, Eastwood drove the Ford in convoy with a BMW, driven by Morris, shadowing it, back to Chessington to search for the group. Having found them on Osborne Way, Eastwood “suddenly accelerated towards them, mounted the pavement, at some point it hit a metal post and struck Mr Dent”, Nelson said. “He disappeared, his body forced and trapped under the vehicle.” An Uber driver heard Dent groaning as the Ford passed by, with the BMW close behind it beeping its horn. He followed, with his dashcam recording the body lying in the road as the two cars drove away. Eastwood had denied intending to cause really serious harm, claiming it was an accident. Morris, 22, of no fixed address, had pleaded guilty to manslaughter shortly before the trial started, it can now be reported. Eastwood’s partner, Jasmine Robinson, 19, of Stoneleigh Crescent, Epsom, Surrey, was found guilty of assisting an offender. All three will be sentenced on 31 March.",News/UK news,Man found guilty of murder after dragging victim under car in Surrey,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/07/man-found-guilty-of-after-dragging-victim-under-car-in-surrey
3/8/2022,"Russia has been trying to recruit Syrians to fight in Ukraine to bolster Moscow’s flagging invasion, according to the Pentagon. A senior US defence official said it is unclear how many Syrians Vladimir Putin is seeking to recruit, but said “we find it noteworthy that he believes he needs to rely on foreign fighters”. The official added there was no evidence of Syrian fighters actually arriving in Ukraine so far. The Russian recruitment effort was first reported by a Syrian news website, DeirEzzor24, which said Moscow was seeking volunteers to act as guards on six-month contracts, for between $200 and $300 a month. The same report said the Russian mercenary firm Wagner had been equipping its Syrian operatives, who had served in the Libyan war on the side of the general, Khalifa Haftar, to transfer to Ukraine. The Wall Street Journal reported that some Syrian mercenaries were already in Russia and prepared to enter the fight in Syria. Russia has also deployed Chechen forces in Ukraine, according to the Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, a close ally of Putin’s. Last week, Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, alleged that a unit of Chechen special forces had been sent to kill the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Danilov said Ukraine had received a tipoff from within Russia’s FSB intelligence agency and had intercepted and killed the Chechen hit squad on the outskirts of Kyiv. There has been so sign yet of any Belarus troops taking part in the Russian invasion of Ukraine or even preparing to take part, according to the Pentagon, despite reports that they may be sent to the front. The reports of recruitment of foreign fighters have come as the Russian offensive directed at Kyiv continued to stall, even after Putin has committed nearly 100% of the substantial invasion force he had mustered on Ukraine’s borders, comprising 127 battalion tactical groups, according to the Pentagon. “We’re not seeing a lot of progress,” a senior defence official said, attributing it to a combination of stiff Ukrainian resistance and “internal challenges” within the Russian forces. The US also deems Ukraine airspace to be still contested, as the Kyiv government’s forces still have most of their fixed-wing aircraft available and flying, and its air defences are still working. But the official cautioned that Russian troops are making more headway in the south, and Vladimir Putin still has a lot more combat power available to him, particularly his air force which has stayed on the sidelines of the war so far. As the ground offensive has stalled, the Pentagon said the Russians are relying more on rocket and missile attacks from a distance. As a result, more civilian areas are being hit, but the Pentagon cannot determine yet whether this is unintentional or deliberate targeting, which would be a war crime. Ukraine has set up its own “international legion” for foreign volunteers to come to its defence. The foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, claimed that over 20,000 people from 52 countries had said they were willing to come to the country to serve alongside the Ukrainian armed forces. Kuleba did not say how many foreign fighters had arrived in Ukraine and did not name the nationality of the volunteers, saying some of their home countries outlawed fighting in foreign wars.",News/World news,"Russia trying to recruit Syrians to fight in Ukraine, says Pentagon",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/russia-trying-to-recruit-syrians-to-fight-in-ukraine-says-pentagon
3/8/2022,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will address UK MPs via video link from Kyiv on Tuesday afternoon, when he is expected to plead for more arms and to repeat a call for a no-fly zone even though it has been rejected by Nato. In a first, the leader’s speech will be broadcast direct into the Commons chamber with formal business suspended so that MPs can listen in with the help of simultaneous translation provided over headsets at 5pm. Ukrainian sources said he was expected to ask Britain to step up its support of arms – and to call for a change of heart in implementing a no-fly zone. “This is the No 1 issue for us. Crucial and vital,” an official said. Zelenskiy has made a string of often dramatic speeches via video link to western leaders since the start of the war. On Saturday, he made a “desparate plea” to 280 members of the US Congress for more aircraft, drones and anti-aircraft missiles. But while the west has been willing to supply Ukraine with increasing amounts of anti-tank and anti-air missiles to help blunt the Russian advance, both Britain and Nato have repeatedly rejected calls for a no-fly zone. On Sunday, Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, and the head of the armed forces, Adm Tony Radakin, said a no-fly zone risked starting a general war with Russia – and would not halt the artillery shelling that has been targeting Ukrainians in cities such as Kharkiv and Mariupol. “We’re not going to get ourselves into a direct military conflict with Putin because that would be a massive escalation, but also that feeds Putin’s narrative,” Raab said. A renewed plea from Zelenskiy will not change the government’s mind, but could have a significant effect on British public opinion. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, said he had given permission for the special address to take place. “Every parliamentarian wants to hear directly from the president,” he said. However, the Commons authorities said Zelenskiy would not be taking questions from MPs.",News/World news,Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address British MPs via video link on Tuesday,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/volodymyr-zelenskiy-to-address-mps-via-video-link-on-tuesday-ukraine
3/8/2022,"Kyiv has rejected an offer from Moscow to create “humanitarian corridors” allowing civilians to flee six heavily bombed Ukrainian cities after it emerged that most of the supposedly safe routes led directly to Russia or its ally, Belarus. The Russian offer came before a third round of peace talks. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said in advance of the discussions that Moscow was ready to halt operations “in a moment” if Kyiv met a list of conditions. These included ceasing military action, changing its constitution to ensure neutrality, acknowledging Crimea as Russian territory and recognising the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states. As Russian forces continued their brutal bombardment on the 12th day of the conflict, shelling of the six cities – which include Kyiv, Kharkiv and the southern port city of Mariupol – continued to prevent civilians from leaving. Multiple attempts to evacuate over the weekend were swiftly abandoned when civilians trying to reach safety came under fire. Under the Russian offer, only two of the proposed corridors would end up in Ukrainian territory. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, accused his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, of “moral and political cynicism” and hypocrisy for making promises to protect civilians so they could flee only to Russia. “I do not know many Ukrainians who want to go to Russia,” he said, adding that full ceasefires to protect civilians were needed, not corridors. Russia has made significant advances in southern Ukraine as it seeks to block access to the Sea of Azov and establish a land corridor to Crimea. But elsewhere progress has become stalled, including an immense military convoy that has been almost motionless for days north of Kyiv. The Pentagon on Monday said in its latest assessment of the war it believed Russia had now committed almost 100% of the forces it had amassed for the Ukraine invasion and launched more than 625 missiles, but still deemed Ukrainian airspace contested the country had most of its fixed wing aircraft and air defences intact. “We’re not seeing a lot of progress,” a senior US defence official said, attributing it to a combination of stiff Ukrainian resistance and “internal challenges” within the Russian forces. As the ground offensive stalls, the Pentagon said the Russians were relying more on rocket and missile attacks from a distance. It added Russia was now also trying to recruit foreign fighters, especially Syrians, to take part in its war in Ukraine, though there was no evidence of Syrian fighters actually arriving in Ukraine. Both US and Ukrainian officials cautioned that Russia still has more combat power available to it, however – including the overwhelming bulk of its air power. Ukraine’s general staff warned that Russian forces were now “beginning to accumulate resources for the storming of the capital”, a city of more than 3 million people. The UN human rights office has reported 406 confirmed civilian deaths but said the number was a vast undercount. On Monday, the bodies of at least 13 civilians were recovered from rubble in the town of Makariv, in the Kyiv region, after a bread factory was hit by an airstrike, while the mayor of Gostomel, a town north of Kyiv which is home to a crucial military airfield, was shot dead by Russian forces along with two other people. They were “distributing bread to the hungry and medicine to the sick”, local officials said. An estimated 1.7 million refugees have left Ukraine since the war began in Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since the second world war. Many millions more have been displaced internally or trapped in cities being brutally pounded by Russian bombardment. Housing blocks, town halls, schools, universities and hospitals have been hit by missile strikes and artillery fire, with some areas reduced to rubble. The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadoviy, said the western Ukrainian city had reached the limits of its capacity and appealed to international organisations for help. The third round of broad ceasefire talks between the two sides was held on Monday, but with Putin vowing to achieve the “neutralisation” of Ukraine “through negotiation or through war”, hopes remain low for any meaningful breakthrough. Under the Russian offer of humanitarian corridors, only two of the proposed routes leading out of the six cities – Kyiv, Kharkiv, Sumy and the southern urban centres of Mariupol, Volnovakha and Mykolayiv – would end up in Ukrainian territory. A spokesperson for the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, described the proposal as “completely immoral”. Ukrainians should have the right “to evacuate to Ukraine”, the spokesperson said. “[Russia] wants to supply humanitarian aid for pictures on TV, and wants the corridors to lead in its direction.” Zelenskiy himself asked the international community to boycott Russian exports and urged a halt to all supplies to Russia. “If they do not want to comply with civilised rules, they should not receive goods and services from civilisation either,” the Ukrainian president said. “Let the war feed them.” The foreign ministry said continued Russian shelling, including of residential areas, was “preventing the safe passage of humanitarian columns … as well as the delivery of medicines and food”. It called on foreign leaders to force Russia to observe an immediate ceasefire. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said attempts over the weekend to evacuate some of the 200,000 refugees trying to escape the besieged southern city of Mariupol using a so-called refugee corridor were rapidly aborted as it became clear the road they were being directed towards had been mined. Civilians came under fire as they tried to leave many other areas including the Kyiv suburb of Irpin, where two adults and two children were killed when a shell hit them. Responding to the incident, Zelenskiy, accused Russian forces of “deliberate murder”. The UK defence ministry said on Monday the Russian tactics appeared to be “an effort to break Ukrainian morale”. British military officials have compared Russia’s tactics to those Moscow used in Chechnya and Syria, surrounding and pulverising cities. Western allies have imposed unprecedented sanctions against businesses, banks and billionaires in an attempt to choke the Russian economy and pressure Moscow to halt its assault, but Putin has equated global sanctions with a declaration of war and warned that Kyiv’s intransigence was “putting in question the future of Ukrainian statehood”. The Russian rouble, however, slumped to new record lows against the dollar and euro on Monday, losing over a third of its value so far this year. Dozens of major companies have severed or severely limited their ties with the country and global share prices plunged on Monday after Washington said it was considering extending its sanctions to Russia’s energy exports. Kyiv continued to call for Nato to impose a no-fly zone over the country but the alliance has repeatedly warned that this would bring it into direct conflict with Russia, and Putin has threatened “colossal and catastrophic consequences” if the west attempts to keep Russian planes out of Ukrainian skies. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, however, said Washington was “working actively” on a deal with Poland to supply it with American jets. Blinken on Monday assured the former Soviet republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania of Nato protection should Russia decide to expand its military campaign. The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed nine attacks on health care infrastructure in Ukraine since the start of the invasion on 24 February. The UN described a psychiatric hospital 60 km (40 miles) from Kyiv running out of water and medicine with 670 people trapped inside, including bedridden patients.",News/World news,‘Humanitarian corridors’ leading to Russia or Belarus rejected by Kyiv,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/russia-humanitarian-corridors-ukraine-war-mariupol-kyiv
3/8/2022,"The mother of an 11-year-old boy from Ukraine who travelled for nearly 700 miles to Slovakia with just a plastic bag, a passport and a telephone number written on his hand has spoken of her relief at her son’s safe escape from Russian bombs. Yulia Pisetskaya said she had put her son on a train to Slovakia from Zaporizhzhia, close to the nuclear plant that came under attack from Russian forces last week, out of desperation. She had been unable to leave with him from south-east Ukraine because she was unwell and needed to look after her disabled mother. Slovakian border guards looked after the boy, who has not been named, on his arrival, according to the police, who have described him as a “hero”. He had the phone number of relatives in the Slovakian capital, Bratislava, written on his hand. The authorities were able to track them down and they have since taken him into their care. “I am very grateful that they saved the life of my child,” Pisetskaya said in a video message posted on Facebook on Sunday. “In your small country, there are people with big hearts.” She added: “I am a widow and I have more children. I want to thank the Slovak customs and volunteers who took care of my son and helped him cross the border. I am grateful you have saved my child’s life. Next to my town is a nuclear power plant that the Russians are shooting at. I couldn’t leave my mother – she can’t move on her own.” The Slovakian interior ministry said on Facebook that the boy “won everybody’s hearts with his smile, fearlessness and determination, worthy of a real hero”. They said the authorities had “kept him warm and provided him with food and drink, which they packed for his next trip”. Officials added: “Thanks to the number on his hand and a piece of paper in his waist, he managed to contact his loved ones, who came for him later, and the whole story ended well.” “He came all alone from Zaporizhzhia because his parents had to stay in Ukraine,” police spokesperson Denisa Bardyova told AFP. “The boy was cared for by many, be it policemen, soldiers, customs officers or volunteers and various religious or civil organisations.” Russian troops attacked the Zaporizhzhia site, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, which creates around 20% of Ukraine’s electricity, in the early hours of Friday.

3/8/2022,"Prompted by the much-discussed Bros documentary, Flo & Joan’s last show fretted at the acrimonious end to which sibling musical partnerships must tend. This one looks through the other end of the telescope, at the prospect of these “singing spinster sisters” doomed to singledom and a 60-year co-dependency. That doesn’t seem such a grim fate given the fun that Flo, Joan (AKA Nicola and Rosie Dempsey) and their audience have across two hours of their touring set Sweet Release. If its new suite of comic songs isn’t quite as big-hitting as the 2019 vintage, this is another entertaining offer from the Dempseys, crowd-pleasing and well woven together. The chat between songs feels looser, too. Nicola, on keyboard, is still taciturn. Rosie, on vocals and sometimes drums, is still dotty. But the dynamic feels less engineered to be awkward than in the past. What seems spontaneous may not be always be so, mind you, given how many casual asides are recycled as lyrics and punchlines later in the show. That brings a neat sense of structure to the evening, whose numbers track the duo’s journey through dating apps, moments of mortification, and – reviving a back catalogue hit – nights (and jobs) lost to heavy drinking. The dating and relationships theme is lightly worn. One number imagines an alien boyfriend (“He doesn’t get along with my father / But he does get along with my microwave”). Another, off-message entirely, addresses – with jazz hands, trumpet noises and a pleasing spirit of free-association – those ageing male comedians inconvenienced by modern mores. The laughs are evenly shared between songs and chat: I loved the image conjured in one conversation, of the touring sisters in twin beds in a Travelodge, “cutting a quiche in half with a credit card”. It’s not all glamour, then. Nor laughter, either, when the focus turns to women’s public safety with a song whose jauntiness is overshadowed (as I’m sure Flo & Joan know) by the bleak realities it evokes. Elsewhere, merriment tends, just about, to outpace real-world concerns. It’s another fine set from a duo whose co-dependency, while bad for them, is a boon for audiences.

3/8/2022,"Over the weekend we were told that Boris Johnson had a six-point plan with which he would lead the west to victory over Russia in Ukraine. However, on closer inspection – and on contact with reality – that plan didn’t seem to amount to very much more than you would expect from a toddler who had been asked to come up with something for a primary school assembly to help other children understand the war. Or something that Gavin Williamson – make that Sir Gavin – might have dreamed up. 1: Get humanitarian aid to Ukraine and be nice to refugees. 2: Support Ukraine’s efforts to do whatever Ukraine wants to do. 3: Increase sanctions on Moscow – though not on anyone we quite like, even if they owe their billions to Vlad the Invader. 4: Tell Russia to shut up and go away. 5: Tell Russia to shut up and go away a bit louder if Russia hasn’t already shut up and gone away. 6: Make more effort to ensure it never happens again. And that was it. Just six vague principles, on which anyone could more or less agree, and no metrics with which to measure their success. Certainly nothing by which The Suspect could claim to be leading the world’s response to the Russian invasion. There again, no one outside the UK is claiming that anyway. And even then, it’s only a small number of people inside Number 10 and Boris-friendly media who see Ukraine as a chance to reboot his premiership. To make him look impressive on the world stage and to make the country forget he is unfit for office. Certainly, the six-point plan appeared to be all but forgotten as Johnson gave a joint press conference with Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, and Mark Rutte, the prime minister of the Netherlands. As was any sense of the UK leading a western coalition against Russia. If Trudeau and Rutte were in any sense taking their cue from Johnson, it was news to them. Rather this was, as far as they were concerned, a meeting of equals. Of three leaders fumbling in the dark as they tried to impose rational solutions on an increasingly irrational Russia. Nor did The Suspect choose to bring up the six-point plan that he had briefed so heavily over the past couple of days in his opening remarks. Probably for the best. In hindsight, even he must see that it’s all a bit feeble. Rather, Johnson just stuck to garbled generalities and platitudes. The international community was almost unanimous in its condemnation and must move together. Putin had underestimated the west and must surely fail. And in the meantime, the UK would be giving Ukraine an extra £175m in humanitarian aid. Trudeau and Rutte said much the same, though in not so many words. Mercifully. Though Trudeau did twice mention something about the importance of middle-class jobs in the ongoing crisis, before going on to say that Canada would be imposing sanctions on 10 new individuals. This clearly startled Johnson. He sincerely hoped that the new people being targeted were not personal friends of his or philanthropists who had donated money to the Tory party. Most of the questions focused on the dependence of the west on Russian oil and gas. The three amigos more or less stuck to the same script. Reducing dependence was a good idea but not every country could move at the same speed. Obviously, no one was going to start an energy crisis in their own country just to help Ukraine. I mean, come on, everyone. Get real. Johnson merely added that he was open to abandoning his commitment to net zero and that increasing North Sea oil production and starting fracking was not off the cards. Though he didn’t seem to be aware that this might not solve the UK’s problems as the oil and gas was likely to be sold abroad. Things got trickier for The Suspect when he was asked about refugee visas and sanctions. On visas, he merely said that the UK wanted to be as generous as possible. Unfortunately, that turned out to be not very generous at all. After all, we had taken loads of Afghan refugees and now the UK was technically full. It was just Ukraine’s bad luck. But hopefully the Poles could help out. On sanctions, the UK was again going the extra mile. It was completely normal for the son of a KGB agent who had done bugger all for the UK to be granted a peerage after the personal intervention of the prime minister. In any case, it wasn’t as if Evgeny Lebedev ever went to the Lords. Or spoke. Or voted. He was a complete waste of space. He just liked to swan around while flunkeys called him “Lordski”. So, no harm done. He was hardly involved in UK politics at all. And as for the really bad oligarchs – as opposed to the pretend baddie oligarchs – The Suspect had them in his sights. Any that hadn’t been of use to the Conservatives would now find that they had to declare their beneficial interests in assets within six months rather than 18 months. However awfully inconvenient for them this might be. Somehow Trudeau and Rutte managed to keep a straight face. It was all rather low key. As if it had only just dawned on everyone there were no quick fixes on offer. Two weeks ago, Johnson had seen Ukraine’s tragedy as an easy shot at personal redemption. Now he was beginning to realise there were strings attached. Tricky choices that would leave him further compromised. Decisions that would cost lives. And personal responsibility isn’t The Suspect’s strongest suit. Nor that of his colleagues. In front of the foreign affairs select committee, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, was putting all the blame for the failure to take more than a handful of refugees on the Home Office. Nothing to do with her Guv. While in the Commons, Priti Patel was insisting that the Home Office figures of just 50 refugees were nothing to do with the Home Office. And that visa staff were in Calais when they weren’t. Apart from those on holiday. Then Priti Vacant at least has an excuse. She’s not just vicious, she’s stupid. Meanwhile, Ukraine burns and its citizens fight on alone.

3/8/2022,"Joe Root admitted his England team have a point to prove in the Caribbean and reiterated his own belief at being the right man to lead in a Test series that could decide his fate as captain. Speaking before Tuesday’s first Test against West Indies in Antigua – a match in which Durham’s Alex Lees will make his debut at opener and Jack Leach is likely to get the nod on a bare pitch – Root attempted to outline his vision of England’s so called “reset”. Despite one win in 14 and a horror Ashes series, the 31-year-old was backed to lead this tour when Andrew Strauss took over as the interim director of cricket. But with a new management team set to be appointed, his continuation beyond is not guaranteed and positive results are urgently required. “It’s an opportunity for all of us to prove a point,” said Root. “Hopefully this can be a real start in changing our performances; to start getting back to where we need to be, which is one of the leading teams in Test cricket. “I think I’m the right man for the role, the right man to take this team forward. And as long as that is the case, I’ll be fully committed to the role.” Root sidestepped the inevitable questions about the absence of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, preferring to focus on “the opportunity” for others. This means Chris Woakes and Craig Overton are likely to share the new ball with Ollie Robinson unfit, alongside Mark Wood’s pace and the spin of Leach. Key to this is how much Ben Stokes can bowl on his comeback from a side strain, with Root optimistic a limited number of overs are possible. Stokes has also recently shouldered arms to the Indian Premier League to focus on Test cricket, having admitted he felt he let down the team in Australia. “I’m pretty chuffed about it,” said Root, regarding this commitment from his vice-captain. “It shows how much he cares about Test cricket and how much he cares about this team and helping us get back to where we desire to be. “I think he is probably being slightly harsh on himself [about his Ashes performance]. But I think managing the expectations for himself, especially with where his body is currently at, is going to be really important. “We all expect Superman on the field. Coming back from an injury, he might not necessarily be able to do some of the things he’s done previously. So we’re going to have to be smart, how we manage him.” Root had encouraging words for Lees, his one-time opening partner at Yorkshire whose runs since a move to Durham in 2018 – and the decision to axe Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed after the Ashes – have made him the latest to attempt England’s most unsettled position. Ben Foakes returns behind the stumps after Jos Buttler lost his place in a reversion to picking the best gloveman. But Root stressed that the 29-year-old’s batting – good enough to register a century on his debut in Sri Lanka three years ago – should not be underestimated. England have never won in Antigua and Root’s opposite number, Kraigg Brathwaite, spoke with a quiet confidence on the eve of the series that is expected to see both teams take a knee for Black Lives Matter before the start of play. Brathwaite said: “This series is always different to every other series we have. We always look forward to it, especially at home. They have some quality cricketers still, so when we do well, you know it’s still a good feeling. To play Test cricket, there is always pressure involved. But as a team, we’re ready.”",Sport/Sport,Joe Root insists he is ‘right man to take England forward’ before Windies series,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/07/joe-root-insists-england-have-point-to-prove-in-west-indies-with-captaincy-on-line
3/8/2022,"Good morning. The Amazon is approaching a tipping point, data shows, which would have “profound” global implications. International Women’s Day today takes a focus on gender equality in the face of the climate crisis, which feels also pertinent on home shores today. Heavy rains and strong winds are expected to continue to batter the east coast again. Heavy Russian shelling was preventing civilian evacuations from six cities, Ukraine’s foreign ministry has said, just hours after Moscow announced the opening of “humanitarian corridors” that Kyiv dismissed as immoral and unacceptable after it emerged only two led to elsewhere in Ukraine, with all others heading straight to Russia or pro-Russian Belarus. Meanwhile, Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak faces a lengthy ban for wearing a “Z” on his uniform, a symbol in support of the invasion of Ukraine, on the medal podium of a World Cup event. Scott Morrison has declared the Coalition the “proven choice” of voters when it comes to managing Australia’s national security interests, but the latest Guardian Essential poll suggests respondents do not believe his government would handle the war between Russia and Ukraine any better than Labor. Despite a lack of unanimity over which party would best handle the conflict, a majority of respondents supported the Morrison government’s decision to provide military support to Ukraine and to supply aid and take in refugees fleeing the conflict. Volunteers in New South Wales flood zones estimate they have cooked a staggering 60,000 meals for flood victims, but frustration is growing at the lack of official government services available to take over. While the presence of government services and defence support is growing, there is a perception that not enough help is on hand. However, the Australian defence force has defended the speed of its response to flooded communities in northern NSW. “I think we have done all that we can within the conditions we have been faced with,” Maj Gen David Thomae said. Meanwhile, residents of Pitt Town on the flood-prone Hawkesbury-Nepean River are “screaming for something to be done” about a safer evacuation plan, after their designated evacuation route was cut by rising water, forcing authorities to locate a gate key to open the only backup path. The mayors of Newcastle and Wollongong are uneasy about the Morrison government naming their cities as a potential base for nuclear-powered submarines, with one describing the Aukus plans as a “fantasy”. The Coalition’s shortlist for potential bases were not in the top five identified by Defence in a 2011 review. The mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) has been discovered in more than 40 piggeries across Australia within the past month and human cases have also emerged. While 99% of cases have no symptoms, the virus can be deadly. Luckily, there are ways to protect yourself. Labor will today unveil a new $77m commitment to train teachers how to talk to students about sexual consent and respectful relationships in an age-appropriate way and also aims to help school students seek support if they have experienced violence. AGL Energy says it is not sure whether an unsolicited takeover bid by billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and Canadian fund manager Brookfield is really over – or if the consortium has just hit the “pause button”. Australia’s mushrooms season is off to an early start thanks to wet weather along the east coast, but experts are warning fungi enthusiasts not to be tempted by edible-looking mushrooms. The Amazon is approaching a tipping point after which the rainforest would be lost, with “profound” implications for the global climate and biodiversity. Georgia has applied for EU membership just days after declaring it would not accelerate its application, as fears grow among the Georgian public that the Russian invasion might not stop with Ukraine. A rare brown bear who became famous after breaking into a bakery and feasting on biscuits has been captured in central Italy, sparking criticism from animal activists. “It was the most exquisite venue I have ever had the privilege to play,” said Tina Arena of the Odeon of Herodes Atticus in Greece, where she performed with George Perris and Greek tenor Mario Frangoulis. “We all did a closing number in Greek, which was an experience because it was my first time singing Greek. Beforehand, the boys put me through my paces and were like: ‘Oh yeah yeah yeah, you can sing in Greek, come on,’ and I’m like, ‘God almighty!’ I kept thinking to myself: ‘This is extraordinary, don’t drop the ball.’” When Netflix announced Byron Baes, a new Australian reality show about wealthy young influencers, there was immediate backlash from locals. After months of controversy, the show is set to start on Netflix this week, and both the cast and crew hope the final product will ease the doubts about its intentions. Netflix wants the show to explore the tension between how we present ourselves online and who we really are underneath.

3/8/2022,"Residents of Pitt Town on the flood-prone Hawkesbury-Nepean River found their designated evacuation route cut by rising water last Wednesday, forcing authorities to locate a gate key to open up the only other path out of the historic centre. That route has been partly under water twice again since Sunday, with another blockage possible on Tuesday amid yet more forecasts for heavy rain. The Bureau of Meteorology was predicting major flooding of the river, in places possibly exceeding both last week’s highs and those of March 2021. “We’ve been screaming for something to be done,” Peter Ryan, the Pitt Town progress association president, told Guardian Australia. “How many fatals do we have to have from this flood due to their lack of interest and total incompetence? Do we have to drown people in their cars trying to escape from here?” Pitt Town turns into a series of islands every time there is a flood described as a “one-in-100-year event”, meaning there is a 1% chance of that occurring in any year. But the population has tripled in the past 15 years, increasing the number of residents who may need to evacuate from the area quickly. “We want a safe, well-maintained flood evacuation route, which doesn’t have the ability to be cut off by local water, which is what happened [last week],” Ryan said. The usual evacuation route consists of several tight bends and is in places barely wide enough for vehicles to pass. The backup route, which has a locked gate and goes through part of a national park, is in an even poorer state – it has many potholes, no speed limits, and is usually only one-way given its narrowness. “I had one mum contact me to say that she drove through [the backup evacuation route] with three kids, and she was just terrified, doing it on her own knowing she was responsible for her kids,” Susan Templeman, the local federal Labor MP, said. “You have got to wonder at how sensible it is to have a locked gate where only a limited number of people have a key to be your key escape route from what could be a very fast-rising flood. Imagine in the dark and in the rain.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Templeman recently inspected the evacuation routes with Ryan. “It was bad enough in daylight with people who knew the way … it’s very easy to miss the signs that are there,” she said. The Hawkesbury council and the state emergency services minister, Steph Cooke, were approached for comment. Mary Lyons-Buckett, a Hawkesbury councillor and former deputy mayor, called on authorities to create easier exits for residents. “I have always believed the priority around flood management and safety of our people is the capacity to ensure they can evacuate safely and without impediment,” Lyons-Buckett said. “We are seeing a lot of localised flooding and road closures. This makes it even more crucial to have designated effective routes to get people to safety.” Vince Rayfield, secretary of the Pitt Town progress association, said their group had been repeatedly rebuffed in their efforts to get documents from authorities detailing how much time the local community needed to escape in case of a worst-case flood scenario. “It takes so many hours to evacuate based on … a certain number of vehicles,” Rayfield said, adding that with a major flood “the entire population has to evacuate”. After the previous state Labor government changed the planning laws in 2006, Pitt Town had more than 1,000 additional development lots created. Most of them have been taken up. Ryan said another threat is that it only takes one tree to be blown over – and damaging winds are forecast for Tuesday and Wednesday from the east coast low – to block even those two inadequate routes out. “It’s getting to the stage we’re just going to have to have a chainsaw in the back of our cars,” he said.The challenges for local drivers have also increased because the privately owned local sewage works has little demand for its treated recycled water for local gardens. As a result, huge tankers come and go constantly. “You wouldn’t want to be behind one of those if it rolled,” Ryan said.",News/Australia news,‘Screaming for something to be done’: NSW town repeatedly cut off by floods demands safe evacuation route,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/15/screaming-for-something-to-be-done-nsw-town-repeatedly-cut-off-by-floods-demands-safe-evacuation-route
3/8/2022,"The economic crime bill, or to give its formal title, the economic crime (transparency and enforcement) bill, was rushed through the Commons on Monday. Here’s what it is and what it is meant to do. In broad terms, it is meant to make life more difficult for people seeking to hide wealth in the UK, particularly those doing so from overseas, including criminals and those – such as Russian oligarchs – who might be seeking to shelter illicitly acquired money, particularly through property purchases. The bill had been repeatedly delayed, and after ministers were unable to guarantee it would even appear in this session of parliament there was recent speculation it might have been dropped. But following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the focus on Russian money in the UK, it was tabled last week and its Commons stages were fast-tracked on Monday. It is to set up a register of overseas entities, which would be a list of the ultimate owners of property or land in the UK bought by overseas individuals or companies. Currently, many expensive properties, especially in London, are owned by opaque shell companies based overseas. The register, to be updated annually, would oblige a company to declare who the “beneficial owner” is, meaning the person who ultimately owns or controls an asset. Failure to properly register such details will be a criminal offence, with a potential punishment of up to five years’ jail. While this is a change that opposition parties and campaigners have long pushed for, there are concerns about some elements. One worry is that existing owners will have up to six months to register, potentially allowing people to dispose of or transfer illicit assets. The bill puts this grace period at an even higher 18 months, but after pressure from Labour and others, a government amendment will reduce it to six. Labour has called for it to be 28 days. There are also concerns that some owners could claim exemptions, and that there is a parallel need for better UK companies records. It is also toughening up the regime for unexplained wealth orders, which can oblige people suspected of acquiring wealth through criminal or illicit means to explain how they did so. Changes include expanding the range of people who can be subject to an order, to cover company directors, and to increase the grounds under which an order can be granted. While the orders can be effective, only four have been imposed since they were introduced in 2018, and none since Boris Johnson become prime minister. Further provisions in the bill will make it easier for ministers to sanction individuals, for example removing the requirement that those targeted must have known or suspected that they breached sanctions law. Ministers have faced criticism for the fact that the UK has so far sanctioned many fewer people accused of connections to Russia and Vladimir Putin than have the US and EU. There has been a parallel plan to toughen rules by which companies are registered at Companies House, and Labour has called for some of these, such as identity checks for directors, to be included in the economic crime bill. This is not going to happen, although the government has pledged to push ahead with its separate proposals on company records. Labour has tabled an amendment calling for this to happen inside 28 days. The bill has widespread support from opposition parties, but many MPs are unhappy about loopholes in the text that they fear may allow wealthy foreign property owners to delay or circumvent the transparency requirements. Several cross-party groups of MPs laid amendments saying they want to scrap exemptions from disclosure if it is not in the interests of the UK economy and to speed up the timetable for revealing the identity of owners. Ministers have indicated that they will consider making some changes to toughen it up before the legislation reaches the Lords but it remains to be seen exactly what they will offer. One of the likely concessions is a move to force people to reveal their identity at the point they are selling or transferring an asset if that falls in the six-month grace period.",News/Business,What is the economic crime bill and how effective will it be?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/07/what-is-the-economic-bill-and-how-effective-will-it-be
3/8/2022,"Two Scottish gardeners have rescued three students – one Irish and two Nigerian – who were trapped in the wartorn city of Sumy in the north-east of Ukraine. Along the way, the men were held at gunpoint by Russian soldiers – but were then rescued themselves by locals. Joe McCarthy, 55, and Gary Taylor, 45, who run Ready2Rock landscaping in Falkirk, made their evacuation dash on Monday morning when they picked up seven people including four Ukrainians. The seven included 19-year-old medical student Racheal Diyaolu from County Carlow, two Nigerian students, an elderly Ukrainian couple and a young mother and her son. Speaking from the back of the car safely 150 miles west of Sumy, Diyaolu said she was “relieved” but had mixed emotions about leaving friends behind. “My mother is very pleased but she is on edge and won’t be happy until I get home,” said Diyaolu. “It’s a bittersweet feeling because it is just so disheartening that so many students are still trapped.” The two Scottish men have become heroes at home after putting their own lives at risk by going to Sumy, which is just 25 miles from the Russian border and has been out of reach of any international rescue mission. “We had guns pointed to our heads, a tank’s sniper pointed at us, our front tyres shot at and our van ransacked, but locals helped us and took us to a garage, got us new tyres and showed us a back road to Sumy,” McCarthy said on Monday. “After a good night’s rest, we got everyone and left. To be honest, we had a miserable day yesterday getting to Sumy, but we are out now and 240km [150 miles] away. “Our objective today was to get as far away as possible, stay overnight in a hotel and get to the border tomorrow.” Their dangerous run came more than a week after all public transport out of Sumy was cancelled, leaving an estimated 1,500 to 1,700 foreign students stranded. More than 700 are Indian pupils, with an estimated 400 from Nigeria. One student interviewed by Indian TV on Friday begged for immediate help, and confirmed they were running out of food and water. “Please take some immediate action or else we will die for sure,” she said. The two Scottish men have become heroes at home because of the evident risks they have taken after they decided they could not sit idly by and watch the humanitarian crisis unfold on TV. They had already completed two missions in Ukraine, including the rescue of a mother and her sick baby, when they got a request from a woman in Sumy. McCarthy said the journey to Sumy, close to Russian-controlled territory, was “mission impossible” but “worth it”. Diyaolu and her Nigerian friends, Roycee Iloielunachi and Anolajuwon Solarin, were planning to spend Monday night with the rest of the group overnight in a hotel in Kremenchuk, which is under Ukrainian control, before an early start for the border with Poland, Romania or Moldova. The Scottish gardeners have been charting their journey on TikTok and Facebook live. “I’m not going to lie, we could have just turned back yesterday when we met the Russians. But it was worth it – we have everyone with us now and bar any catastrophe we should be at the border in the morning,” said McCarthy. While this is a victory for my family and I, and we are beyond grateful that my sister is currently on the way to safety🤞🏾I’d like to remind everyone that there are hundreds of international students still currently stranded in Sumy, with no way out as of yet. #SaveSumyStudents Diyaolu’s sister Christiana in Carlow said she was “beyond grateful” that her sister was on the way to safety. Despite their terrifying brush with the Russians, McCarthy and Taylor say they intend to go back to Ukraine – with more than a dozen requests outstanding.",News/World news,Hailed as heroes – Scottish gardeners who rescued trio from Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/hailed-as-heroes-scottish-gardeners-who-rescued-trio-from-ukraine
3/8/2022,"Priti Patel has been accused of presiding over chaos after Ukrainian refugees arriving in Calais were greeted by posters telling them to get their UK visas in Paris or Brussels, while her pledge to expand the visa scheme was contradicted by Downing Street. On a day of confusion and uncertainty for Ukrainian refugees making the 1,400-mile journey to Britain, the home secretary admitted that she has not yet set up a visa application centre (VAC) near the French port of Calais where refugees have gathered. It also emerged that the UK office in Brussels is open on three half-days a week to process applications. The details emerged at the end of a difficult day for Patel, who had earlier claimed she would introduce a new humanitarian route to enter Britain but was contradicted by Boris Johnson. The prime minister is under pressure to welcome more refugees from Ukraine following the heavy bombardment of civilians by the Russian army. Of the 1.3 million-plus Ukrainians to have fled since Russia invaded, the UK has said it will only take those with family connections or sponsorship by a third party. Appearing before MPs on Monday, Patel said her department was in the process of setting up a VAC “en route” to Calais to cross the Channel to Britain. “We have staff in Calais, we have support on the ground. It is wrong to say we’re just turning people back, we’re absolutely not, we’re supporting those that have been coming to Calais,” she said. Stella Creasy, the Labour MP, said: “As of an hour ago there was a poster in Calais saying ‘no visas delivered in Calais’. It tells people to go to an online form and then go to Paris or Brussels.” The shocking poster that greets Ukraine refugees arriving here in Calais. Appears to be absolutely no official British help on the ground for these traumatised people. The wonderful volunteers of @Care4Calais are doing their best to help. pic.twitter.com/NHFR3ZltHv Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, questioned why there were so many reports of Ukrainians in the French town unable to apply for a visa because there was no official available to process applications. “I hope the home secretary is going to deliver some of the promises she has made, but there is a huge gap between the rhetoric and the reality that is badly, badly letting Ukrainian families down,” Cooper said. The Commons clash came after sources close to Patel confirmed reports that she was pushing through proposals for a third Ukrainian visa scheme. The Sun had quoted Patel as saying she was “investigating the legal options to create a humanitarian route”. On Monday morning, a Home Office source told the Guardian a third route was being considered, in line with the Sun’s claims. “As the crisis is developing it is becoming clear some people have needs that go beyond what sponsorship can offer and she does not want to see anyone excluded – hence why [a separate humanitarian route is] being considered with partner governments,” the source said. However, the prime minister’s spokesperson contradicted this soon afterwards, saying Patel had been referring to a route announced last week, which allows Ukrainian refugees to be sponsored to come to the UK by a third party. “We have set out the two routes we are putting in place. The sponsorship route is a humanitarian route,” the spokesperson said. In a televised clip, Johnson said any humanitarian route would still check each individual applicant before they are allowed into Britain. “Let me be very clear, what we won’t do is have a system where people can come into the UK without any checks, or any controls at all,” he said. James Cleverly, the minister for Europe and America, had also earlier contradicted Patel, telling the BBC there were no plans for a specific humanitarian route for Ukrainians. “No, this is what has been in place previously,” he said. “We need to have some sort of process. We need to know who is here, where they are staying, what support they might need, if there are child protection issues. Whilst all of us would want to throw our arms open and be as generous as possible, there does need to be a process.” Ministers are facing pressure to do more, including from some Tory backbenchers. Asked if the UK refugee scheme had been a failure, Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the foreign affair select committee, told LBC Radio: “It’s certainly not a success, is it? What we need to do is to make sure that … the Home Office is absolutely delivering to make sure we get support for those who are most in need. “The British people are extremely generous … This isn’t some sort of illegal scam. This is perfectly obviously people fleeing for their lives and we need to be absolutely there to support them.”",News/UK news,Priti Patel under fire over chaotic Ukrainian refugee policy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/uk-minister-denies-plans-for-humanitarian-route-for-ukrainian-refugees
3/8/2022,"Ramping up production from the UK’s oil and gas fields in the North Sea could help ease the pain of high fuel prices in the short term but should not be seen as a long-term solution to Britain’s energy woes, experts have warned. Lord Adair Turner, former CBI chief and former chair of the Committee on Climate Change, now chair of the Energy Transitions Commission thinktank, said the prime minister’s plan to produce more oil and gas now marked a sensible move, but he cautioned against those who saw a continued future in increased production. “You have to distinguish between the short term – more gas from existing fields – and the long term,” said Turner. “You would have to be a very furious climate campaigner to say in the middle of a war you could not take measures like that. “So we will probably have to take these short-term measures, like squeezing more from existing fields or importing more LNG [liquefied natural gas, by tanker], but fundamentally we want no new oil and gas [exploration] from the North Sea. The future of the North Sea should be windmills, not oil and gas.” The returns from a push to expand production were likely to be limited, and so the focus should also be on renewable energy, added Bob Ward, policy director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics. “The UK is already committed to maximum economic recovery of oil and gas from the North Sea, but it is a mature basin with declining production, which is why the UK currently has to import about half of the natural gas that it consumes,” he said. “We can see from history that the price of natural gas and oil is volatile, so the only way to prevent future crises is for the UK to cut its dependence on fossil fuels by deploying alternatives to fossil fuels. To reach net zero, these alternatives need to be clean.” New licensing for North Sea oil and gas fields, which the government is also pursuing, would not produce any more fuel for decades, the Committee on Climate Change warned recently, so would be of no value in increasing production for the current crisis and would only leave stranded assets for the future. The CCC said it “favoured” an end to new licences but barring the government from granting licences was beyond its remit. Some commentators, particularly some on the right of the Tory party, have also called for more fracking as a solution to high energy prices. However, even if the local objections to fracking could be overcome, it would take years to produce any gas in the UK. Modern fracking techniques were first tried in the UK over a decade ago by Cuadrilla, but it was soon forced to stop owing to earth tremors. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has said no fracking could be resumed unless this issue was resolved. A spokesperson said: “The UK has no issue with gas supply, and unlike other countries in Europe, the UK is in no way dependent on Russian gas, with imports making up just 4% of demand. “Fracking would have no effect on domestic energy prices in the near term. To boost energy security, we need to move away from expensive fossil fuels and generate more cheap, clean and secure power in the UK.” Fracking would also require the industrialisation of swathes of the UK countryside. Rob Gross, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, said: “As an immediate response to events in Ukraine, fracking cannot provide a solution because it will take several years for prospective sites to become operational. “In the longer term, fracking could improve our energy independence but that would not change the fact that the price of gas is set on international markets.” If the UK wants to stop importing gas by next winter, that would be theoretically possible if every home were made energy efficient, according to calculations by Jan Rosenow, director of the Regulatory Assistance Project. He said: “We import about 150 TWh of gas for home heating every year. None of this would be needed if we insulated our homes and switched to heat pumps. “We could save more gas than we import for heating with existing technologies. What is needed is the government to step up its policies now to roll out insulation and deploy heat pumps as quickly as possible.” Rebecca Newsom, head of politics for Greenpeace UK, also warned against cutting government support for renewable energy in an effort to reduce bills, pointing out that this had backfired in the past because the levies funded insulation and other efficiency and low-carbon measures that were abandoned. “We have already seen what happens when, in David Cameron’s infamous words, ministers ‘cut the green crap’ – UK energy bills are now £2.5bn higher thanks to that. Our gas-guzzling homes are funding Putin’s war, hurting our pockets as gas prices soar and wrecking the climate,” she warned. “This is the price we pay for decades of government failure to end our dependence on fossil fuels. Our best hope for a safer, healthier, peaceful future is in moving away from oil and gas as quickly as possible and investing in clean energy and warmer homes.”",News/Environment,"Don’t let high energy prices derail UK green agenda, say climate experts",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/07/dont-let-high-energy-prices-derail-uk-green-agenda-say-climate-experts
3/8/2022,"Ukrainians attempting to flee to safety in the UK have described intense frustration and anger at the bureaucratic hurdles and technical difficulties involved in securing a visa under the new Ukrainian family scheme. Numerous applicants said they were stuck in unfamiliar countries on the border with Ukraine, unable to come to the UK because they were wrestling with the complex application process. Some said they were having difficulties uploading crucial documents or the application website was crashing, while others said there were no appointment slots available to finalise their applications, or that they were dismayed to be asked to post supporting documents to an office in Wandsworth. Families in the UK who are trying to help relatives make their way to Britain said they were confused by the complexity of the visa form. “I understand they are under pressure with many applications, but the system is not flexible. This is a humanitarian crisis,” a British citizen, who asked not to be named, said, as she struggled to submit a visa application for her aunt and 14-year-old cousin who have fled Kyiv and are currently in Romania. An apparent glitch in the system meant she was unable to upload documents proving the family connection, and received an email telling her she should post supporting documents to an address in Wandsworth, along with a fee of £75 per application (or £100 for a priority service) for the documents to be scanned. When she called the Home Office hotline on Sunday, staff said they were aware of an issue with uploading documents. “I’m furious with the process. My aunt has fled war, grabbed only important belongings, doesn’t speak English and desperately wants to be with family.” On Sunday, announcing that just 50 applications had been granted, the Home Office added that 11,750 people had started an application but not yet completed it. Some applicants said it was hard to complete applications because the visa appointment website crashed midway through. Matthew Peat, a senior manager with an accountancy firm, described trying to help his sister-in-law and her nine-year-old daughter, who had travelled from Ukraine to Rome, where they were hoping to get a UK visa appointment. However, when he attempted to book a slot for them, the only appointments he could access were in Poland. “It would now appear that the only way to progress this matter is to ask our exhausted and distressed family members to travel from Italy to Poland to access the system there,” he said. “They are feeling very depressed and feel that they are not welcome here.” Refugee organisations said these bureaucratic and technical issues highlighted the case for replacing a complex visa application with a simpler, visa-free humanitarian refugee scheme. Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty International UK’s refugee and migrant rights director, said: “Instead of persisting with its insistence on visas or on sponsorship schemes for traumatised Ukrainians fleeing an active war zone, the UK should be putting in place fast-track refugee arrangements.” Andriy Marchenko, the deputy Ukrainian ambassador in London, urged ministers to apply the proposed new scheme as a matter of urgency. He added: “Ukrainians are known to be diligent, hardworking people who will be providing for themselves here. They will not overstay their welcome and at the end of their term in the UK they will return home to rebuild their country.” Lawyers working with applicants under a pro bono scheme, the Ukraine Advice Project, highlighted concerns that the family scheme was limited in its definition of immediate and extended family members, and did not include in-laws or nieces and nephews of British citizens, unless they are under 18. There was also concern that a significant number of Ukrainian nationals working or studying in the UK were excluded from the scheme, and that many people were struggling to get appointments to submit biometric data (photographs and fingerprints). A government spokesperson said details of a new humanitarian refugee route would be announced soon, adding: “This is a rapidly moving and complex picture and as the situation develops we will continue to keep our support under constant review.” News that the last UK visa centre operating in Ukraine had closed at the end of last week prompted Adil Arslan, a British citizen, to set off to drive to Ukraine on Monday to collect his stepchildren, Maksym, 17 and Alina, 11, who were being cared for by grandparents. “I can’t just sit and wait in the UK while bombs are being dropped everywhere. Why on earth is Home Office not acting more swiftly?” he said. Nataliya Rumyantseva, who lives in the UK and is of Ukrainian heritage, is one of the few who has succeeded in obtaining a visa for her mother, Valentyna Klymova, 69, who fled Ukraine soon after the invasion began by walking across the border into Hungary. Klymova was only granted the visa after spending three days in Paris and going between the UK embassy, consulate, visa processing centre and UK immigration officials at the Gare du Nord train station. “Not everybody can afford to spend several nights in hotels in Paris,” said Rumyantseva. “It creates a kind of existential despair in Ukrainians trying to reach the UK when they have to go through this after escaping from the war. The Home Office needs to simplify the visa process for Ukrainians.”",News/World news,Ukrainians hampered by bureaucracy from reaching safety in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/ukrainians-hampered-by-bureaucracy-from-reaching-safety-in-uk
3/8/2022,"Twenty fire engines and 125 firefighters were called to a fire at a block of flats on Whitechapel High Street. Crews tackled a fire on the 17th floor of the building. The London fire brigade mobilised its 64-metre ladder for the incident and said its control officers took more than 50 calls about the blaze. The Metropolitan police said the building was being evacuated. By Monday evening, the fire appeared to be extinguished. Firefighters were called at 3.53pm and crews from Whitechapel, Shoreditch, Dowgate, Bethnal Green, Dockhead, Old Kent Road, Islington and surrounding fire stations are at the scene. A London fire brigade spokesperson said the cause of the fire was “not known at this stage”. The London ambulance service advised people in Whitechapel to keep their windows closed and stay indoors as fire crews tackled the blaze. A spokesperson said: “We sent an ambulance crew, an incident response officer, a team leader in a fast response car and members of our hazardous area response team. “We are working closely with our emergency service colleagues, more updates to follow.” Transport for London’s incident response team also attended the scene. Eyewitnesses at the scene said glass panels were seen to be falling to the ground from a height of about 100 metres. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said he was in “close contact” with the London fire brigade commissioner, Andy Roe. The structure, called the Relay building, is a 21-story housing development that is run by Network Homes UK, a housing association. According to the property developer Hondo Enterprises, which sold the building in 2018, it is a mixed-use development consisting of more than 7,000 sq feet of retail area, 97,000 sq feet of commercial office space and 207 residential flats. It is located over Aldgate East tube station, between the City of London and the neighbourhoods of Aldgate and Spitalfields. A spokesperson for Network Homes said: “We’re pleased to see everyone has been safely evacuated from the building. “Network Homes is a leaseholder of 75 flats across floors seven-11 of this building. Overall responsibility for the building lies with the freeholder, and we actively engage with their managing agent on fire safety measures.”",News/UK news,Whitechapel: 20 fire engines called to blaze in block of flats in east London,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/07/fifteen-fire-engines-called-to-fire-in-block-of-flats-in-east-london
3/8/2022,"Vladimir Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine is a turning point in history. But no one knows who will emerge victorious as one era ends and another is born. Before this war, the momentum was with Mr Putin, whose military adventurism paid off in the last decade while the United States, humbled by Iraq, turned inward. However, the Russian president’s invasion of Ukraine has been a criminal mistake. Russian soldiers are killing civilians, who share a Slavic identity, and flattening cities in land that gave birth to their country’s culture. Mr Putin’s unprovoked war against a smaller, democratic neighbour has resulted in 1.7 million people fleeing their homes. This is a humanitarian crisis on the edge of Europe. If war was just a battle for public opinion, Mr Putin would have lost by now. Moscow understands this dynamic which might explain why it cynically undermined peace talks by offering humanitarian corridors for trapped populations only to shell Ukrainians who attempt to use them. This bodes ill for talks later this week between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministries in Turkey. Moscow, perhaps for public consumption at home, is seeking to play peacemaker in a war that it started. The Kremlin’s spokesperson told Reuters that Russia was ready to halt military operations “in a moment” if Kyiv meets a list of conditions, such as recognising Crimea as Russian territory and giving two Russian-majority regions independence. It is hard to see how any government in Kyiv could survive in power if it signed such a “land-for-peace” deal. Wilful blindness lies at the heart of Russia’s problems. Mr Putin’s political blunder was to see Ukrainians as waiting to be liberated by Russian soldiers. Mr Putin’s belief that the US, the EU and the west’s Pacific allies were too divided to be capable of collective action was misguided. Not only have these nations managed to come together, but they are supplying arms to Ukraine in a manner which suggests they want Moscow defeated. Mr Putin might have wished for a quick military operation capped off by a lightning decapitation of the Ukrainian government. Instead, he faces a grinding war of occupation in the largest all-European country. Unlike in Chechnya and Syria, where Mr Putin could rely on local proxies to run a dirty war, war crimes in Ukraine will diminish Russia’s stature in the world. Moscow’s military aggression threatens its foreign policy. Mr Putin is trying to veto the Iranian nuclear deal unless he gets guarantees that Russia won’t be subject to sanctions if it convinces Tehran to sign up to the pact. Russia remains a vital player in the commodity markets. The “black earth” breadbasket of the Eurasian steppe sees Russia and Ukraine supply a quarter of the world’s wheat exports. Yet Mr Putin’s war threatens regimes – including Russia’s allies – in the Middle East who are watching wheat prices approaching levels not seen since the Arab spring. Russia’s invasion could disrupt energy markets on a scale not seen since the 1970s. Cutting off oil and gas from Russia would be a self-inflicted embargo. But it would also hit Mr Putin’s ability to pay for his war. With the spectre of runaway inflation haunting the west, Washington has begun to woo oil-rich pariahs such as Venezuela, a Russian ally. Peter Beaumont, a Guardian war reporter, wrote that where “states stand on the spectrum from fragility to resilience, an issue that takes in everything from social cohesion in conflict to the ability to sustain a protracted war effort” must be understood in conflicts in determining which side can last the course. Mr Putin is fighting the wrong war in Ukraine. Instead of finding a way of living with his neighbours, he has set himself on subduing Ukraine – and risking the ruination of Russia.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Putin’s war in Ukraine: Moscow’s on the losing side | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/07/the-guardian-view-on-putins-war-in-ukraine-moscows-on-the-losing-side
3/8/2022,"Last week’s anniversary of the murder of Sarah Everard was a reminder of everything that has gone wrong in the criminal justice system when it comes to violence against women committed by men. The way that this case and the killing of Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman were handled by the Metropolitan police was a key reason why Dame Cressida Dick was forced out of her job as its chief. Whoever replaces her in the UK’s highest-profile policing job must know that confidence in the police’s approach to female victims of sexual and violent crimes has fallen very low. A review of the way that police dealt with several earlier reports about Wayne Couzens exposing himself is ongoing. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has announced that tackling violence against women and girls (VAWG) is to become a strategic policing requirement, on an equivalent footing with terrorism, organised crime and child sexual abuse. She has also launched a campaign aimed at highlighting the scale of the problem, and encouraging men to change their behaviour. Maggie Blyth, the police’s national lead on VAWG, has admitted that one problem is the attraction policing can hold for men who seek opportunities to exert power over women. With this in mind, it is a relief that efforts are now being made to recruit more women. But the proof will be in the pudding. Cuts to budgets lie behind many of the present problems as Sarah Crew, the national police lead on rape (a separate role from Maggie Blyth’s), admitted last year. The disbanding of dedicated teams set up to investigate rapes in various forces had led, she said, to complex crimes including copious digital evidence being handled by a “very inexperienced workforce”. These damaging changes are now in the process of being reversed. Expanding the role of specialist units within the Crown Prosecution Service, and improving joint working with the police, are two strands of the CPS’s five-year plan to prosecute more rapes. More support for victims is also promised. All these initiatives will require sustained funding and training. Last year the court of appeal ruled against a group of women’s charities in a case that sought to link the declining number of prosecutions with changes to CPS guidance, which emphasised the importance of securing convictions. Low conviction rates have long been a source of concern to campaigners as well as to prosecutors. But the collapse in the number of reports leading to a trial is even more alarming, and likened by the victims’ commissioner, Dame Vera Baird, to the “decriminalisation of rape”. The number of prosecutions fell 60% in the four years to 2019/20 – a period during which the number of rapes reported almost doubled. Investigating these cases is difficult. Combing through digital evidence such as phone records is resource-intensive. But a situation in which violent men feel able to commit sexual offences with impunity, as Wayne Couzens did, is intolerable and dangerous. Women must be able to trust that their reports will be dealt with seriously and promptly, by police officers and lawyers with relevant expertise. On International Women’s Day, ministers should pledge that this will happen.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on how to convict rapists: put experts in charge | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/07/the-guardian-view-on-how-to-convict-rapists-put-experts-in-charge
3/8/2022,"The first lesson of the gas crisis is old and boring: the UK should get serious about insulating its leaky properties. If all homes that have energy performance certificate band D were upgraded to band C, the UK’s total gas demand would fall by 7%, and imports by 15%, the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit calculates. Given the UK’s wretched record in insulation versus European peers, that sounds a small but easy win. The second part – the supply side – is where the trickier stuff starts. The broad energy direction has been set towards nuclear and renewables, but there’s no getting away from the fact that gas will be in the mix for a long time yet. Virtually all transition scenarios imagine it, and you have to be an extreme optimist to believe UK consumers can quickly be converted to the joys of heat pumps. Thus, from one quarter, comes a call for a fracking revolution under Lancashire. Readers of the Mail on Sunday at the weekend were treated to a blast in the form of Nigel Farage’s refrain about how “net zero is net stupid” and that the answer to our energy woes is homegrown shale gas. Prepare to hear more in similar style. As UK wholesale gas prices reach unheard-of levels, a well-resourced fracking lobby has reassembled. It is therefore reassuring to know that the secretary of state for business and energy is having none of it. Kwasi Kwarteng wrote a sensible piece in the same paper that backed more homegrown nuclear and more renewables and pointed out the drawbacks with fracking. The gas would take a decade to arrive in volume even if the moratorium were lifted tomorrow. Local planning conditions in densely populated areas are severe; what works in Texas won’t do in Lancashire. One can add that the economics of UK shale are currently guesswork: having 50 years of theoretical reserves doesn’t mean it can all be recovered at commercially viable prices. But here’s the rub. “We also need to back North Sea oil and gas while we transition to cheap, clean power,” said Kwarteng. On that score he is surely also correct. There is “a certain hypocrisy”, as the independent energy analyst Peter Atherton puts it, on the part of the opponents of North Sea development “in being anti-UK production when they know that all their own scenarios see the need for substantial amounts of gas into the 2030s.” Quite: if the gas is going to arrive anyway, best to get it close to home where environmental standards can be controlled. It’s not a universally popular view, but it would be legitimate for Kwarteng to ask North Sea firms for projections of how much they could increase gas output over the next one, five and 10 years while we wait for extra renewables and nuclear capacity to arrive. Then it would be a matter of incentivising production (whether by contracts-for-difference or whatever) from a source that, unlike shale, offers certainty. Since gas projects work on long payback horizons, we might find ourselves paying extra to turn off supplies in the mid-2030s to hit carbon-reduction targets, but that, unfortunately is the current unattractive position. Simple solutions do not exist, but the need to retain secure supplies plus broad consumer support for net zero targets persists. Investing in North Sea gas, as a backup to the drive towards low-carbon tech, looks only pragmatic. The Conservative peer Greg Barker was adamant last week. “Whatever the optics,” he would not “shirk responsibility” by resigning as executive chairman of EN+, the aluminium giant founded by the sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. He was thinking only about the company’s employees. A few days’ reflection – or perhaps the sight of senior Conservative voices calling for his removal from the House of Lords – have prompted a rethink. Barker has tendered his resignation. One cannot yet call it a clean departure, though, because in the next breath, EN+ confirmed reports that it was considering spinning off a chunk of its business, including the non-Russian operations of the core Rusal subsidiary. Barker, it seems, could re-emerge as head of the carved-out operation. His high-profile resignation, in other words, could end up being more of a soft-shoe shuffle into a new role within a restructured entity. Maybe he wouldn’t be paid a salary of $4m a year in the new gig, as he was at EN+ in 2020, but we’re at the point in this saga where personal credibility demands a full exit. He should not have taken a job at a Deripaska-backed firm in the first place. Just get out altogether now.",News/Business,Looking at new North Sea gas supplies may not be palatable but is pragmatic | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/07/looking-at-new-north-sea-gas-supplies-may-not-be-palatable-but-is-pragmatic

It is believed that eight people were killed during Russian shelling, the mayor of Irpin, Oleksandr Markushyn, said on Sunday. In a statement made on Telegram, Markushyn wrote: “A family died in front of my eyes. Two small children and two adults died.” He added: “Irpin is at war, Irpin has not surrendered. Part of Irpin was indeed captured by Russian invaders, but part of Irpin is fighting and not surrendering.” The attack was also addressed by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who said in a video address on Sunday evening: “They were just trying to get out of town. To escape. The whole family. How many such families have died in Ukraine. We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will punish everyone who committed atrocities in this war.” Anastasiia Yalanskaya Anastasiia Yalanskaya, a 26-year-old woman, was killed while attempting to deliver supplies to a dog shelter in Bucha on Thursday.

3/8/2022,"Gas prices and petrol hit an all-time high and oil neared record levels on Monday after the US said it had discussed the prospect of an embargo on exports from Russia, before pushback from Germany eased the market tension. The price of gas for delivery in the UK in April soared to 800p per therm at one point, up from 460p on Friday and 20 times the price of the same contract a year ago, before the autumn energy price crunch and war in Ukraine hit. European benchmark gas prices jumped by 79% to as high as €345 per megawatt-hour, while Brent crude oil soared by more than 10% in early trading to $139 per barrel, a 14-year high and close to the all-time record of $147.50 set in July 2008. Markets were responding to comments by the US secretary of state, Andrew Blinken, who referred to “very active discussions” with allies about escalating sanctions against the Kremlin by banning the import of Russian oil and natural gas. As commodity prices surged, the average cost of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts reached a new record of 155.62p on Sunday, according to the data firm Experian Catalist, while diesel was also at an all-time high, at 161.28p. Analysts at Bank of America said cutting off oil exports by Russia, the world’s second largest supplier at 5m barrels a day, could send oil shooting to $200 a barrel. Prices only eased after Germany’s new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, appeared to pour cold water on the prospect of a coordinated transatlantic embargo on Russian oil and gas. “Europe has deliberately exempted energy supplies from Russia from sanctions,” he said. “Supplying Europe with energy for heat generation, mobility, electricity supply and industry cannot be secured in any other way at the moment. It is therefore of essential importance for the provision of public services and the daily lives of our citizens.” Boris Johnson lent support to Scholz, saying: “I think there are different dependencies in different countries, and we have to be mindful of that.” The British prime minister told a press conference on Monday: “It is completely the right thing to do to move away from dependence on Russian hydrocarbons, but we have to do it step by step.” Europe sources about 40% of gas imports and about 27% of oil imports from Russia, but Germany is more reliant than any other major economy on the continent on Kremlin-controlled supplies. After Scholz spoke, the UK benchmark gas price dropped back from 800p per therm to 500p, still in record territory, while oil pared back some of its gains but was still up 4% at $123. On the stock markets, the FTSE100 closed down 0.4% at 6959, while France’s Cac40 shed 1.3% and Germany’s Dax was the worst affected, ending the day just under 2% lower. Panic on trading floors sent safe havens sharply higher, with gold hitting as much as $2,000.86, its highest since mid-2020. CHART OF THE DAY: The Brent crude oil market, since the launch of futures in June 1988 to today (nominal prices).

The Bank of America chief economist Ethan Harris said cutting off most of Russia’s energy exports would be a “major shock to global markets”, and the loss of Russia’s 5m barrels could see oil prices double to $200 a barrel. Rising commodity prices will only add to the global inflationary pulse, with US consumer price data this week expected to show annual growth at a stratospheric 7.9%, and the core measure at 6.4%. It leaves a tough decision for the European Central Bank when it meets this week against a backdrop of a sharply falling euro. The nightmare scenario of stagflation – where inflation combines with stagnating growth – looms for the world economy. “Given the potential for stagflation is very real, the ECB is likely to maintain maximum flexibility with its [quantitative easing] programme at €20bn through the second quarter and potentially beyond, thus effectively pushing out the timing of rate hikes,” said Tapas Strickland, an economist at NAB. “Higher inflation forecasts, though, mean rate hikes will be needed on the horizon.”",News/Business,Energy price shock eases slightly as Germany allays fears of imminent Russia embargo,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/07/oil-prices-near-all-time-record-as-us-and-europe-consider-ban-on-russian-crude
3/8/2022,"My wife, Milica “Misha” Brozović, who has died aged 84, was a leading figure in the medical field of haematology. She was deeply committed to caring for patients and their families dealing with inherited blood diseases such as sickle cell disease. Her work resulted in better treatment, information and screening services nationally for these patients. Born in Belgrade, Serbia, Misha was the daughter of Jelisaveta (nee Vuković) and Filip Vasić, chief scientist at the city’s Institute for the Economics of Investments. While at grammar school she decided to become a physician. After graduating in medicine from the University of Belgrade in 1962 and completing her internship, she went to London in 1964 as a research assistant in the department of haematology at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School. After appointments at Hammersmith hospital, St Bartholomew’s, the National Institute for Medical Research and Northwick Park hospital, she was invited to become the first consultant haematologist in the Central Middlesex hospital in London in 1975. There she encountered patients, and their families, who were severely affected by sickle cell disease and for whom appropriate medical and social services did not exist. With the help of her colleagues, medical and social workers, in 1979 Misha established the Brent Sickle Cell Centre, providing treatment, information and advice. The group also established services for neonatal screening for haemoglobin S for families, and later a regional referral centre for neonatal screening of other abnormalities of haemoglobin synthesis. The department became a model whose influence spread nationwide and provided an impetus for the creation of the Sickle Cell Society, a registered charity established in 1979. Misha was a leader as well as a physician, teacher, researcher and administrator. As a physician she was loved by her patients. As a teacher at Central Middlesex and at St Mary’s Hospital Medical School she influenced several young doctors to become professors in haematology. As a researcher she published more than 100 papers. For a while she was also head of the pathology department at Central Middlesex. After retirement in 1993, Misha continued working as a visiting consultant haematologist in the university hospitals of the Medical School of Abu Dhabi, the Medical School of Cape Town, and the Medical School of Otago at the University in Christchurch. In the 2010s, and back in the UK, Misha studied astronomy, obtaining a diploma in the subject from University College London. Misha enjoyed life, always with a smile on her face: with friends, visiting museums, going to concerts and theatres, and walking and climbing. She was an avid explorer, loved hiking on her local Ridgeway trail, in the Lake District or in Zanskar, northern India, diving in the Maldives, and exploring the Arabian desert. Above all, though, she cherished the time she spent with her grandchildren, Daniel, Helen and Nina. We met in the Julian Alps in Slovenia during a snowstorm in 1955, and married three years later.

3/8/2022,"In the southern port city of Mariupol, police were going from basement shelter to basement shelter. The message to those who have been trapped by days of brutal Russian shelling in the besieged city of 430,000 on the Sea of Azov was simple. Do not come out, terrified residents were warned, until you hear a message on the loud speakers. Do not try to evacuate, despite the promises by Russian forces of safe passage. The warning was well founded. On the main road out – eyed as a key escape route – heavy Russian shelling continued on Monday, Ukrainian forces said. The previous day officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross had identified it as having been mined. “The route is not safe,” said Sergei Orlov, the deputy mayor. “We do not have confirmation at the moment that a ceasefire started.” The day after eight civilians including a family of three were killed by Russian mortar fire while trying to evacuate from Irpin on the outskirts of Kyiv, analysts and political leaders were experiencing a sense of deja vu, pointing to the cynical Russian use of humanitarian corridors in Chechnya and more recently in Syria, where Russian – or Russian-brokered – promises of safe passage were either worthless, or used as a ploy to allow the repositioning of forces. In 2018, in the eastern Damascus suburb of Ghouta, under siege from the Kremlin-backed Syrian government, the Russians, acting as mediators, brokered a ceasefire with the UN to allow civilians to escape. Instead civilians were shelled as they attempted to escape, prompting a US state department spokesperson to condemn the ceasefire as “a joke”. The analyst Anna Borshchevskaya, writing a paper for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a conservative thinktank, drew a line between Russian manipulation of ceasefires in Syria and what has been happening in Ukraine, describing “a string of broken ceasefires”. The Russian offer of six humanitarian corridors out of Ukrainian cities, of which four led to Russia or pro-Russia Belarus, was being described in similar terms to the grim “joke” in Ghouta – as a “cynical” stunt, “immoral” and “hypocritical”. In reality, as Ukrainian officials pointed out, despite the promise of a ceasefire, it was Russian shelling that was preventing the evacuation of civilians from Kyiv, Mariupol, Sumy, Kharkiv, Volnovakha and Mykolaiv. “This prevents the safe passage of humanitarian columns with Ukrainian and foreign citizens, as well as the delivery of medicines and food,” Ukraine’s foreign ministry said in a statement. “All this is not serious, it is moral and political cynicism, which I find intolerable,” the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said. “I don’t know many Ukrainians who want to take refuge in Russia,” he told LCI television. Ukrainian officials described the humanitarian corridor offer as “completely immoral” and called for genuine safe routes for civilians. The Russian defence ministry later announced a new push, saying civilians would be allowed to leave Kyiv, Mariupol, Kharkiv and Sumy, but it came as Russian forces continued to pound other locations across the country. And as the hours passed on Monday with little sign of a ceasefire, it appeared there had been little meaningful evacuation. The conflict has driven more than 1.7 million to flee the country and millions more are trapped under brutal Russian bombardment of civilian areas and are seeking to escape. The mayor of Irpin, where eight people were killed by Russian mortar fire during an evacuation attempt on Sunday, accused Russian forces of deliberately targeting those fleeing. “Everyone knows where we are taking civilians out by car, along the evacuation routes. And they are targeting the routes,” said Oleksandr Markushin, echoing accusations that Russia had also shelled an evacuation route from Mariupol. The handful of residents of the port city of 430,000 who managed to flee said it had been devastated. “We saw everything: houses burning, all the people sitting in basements,” said Yelena Zamay, who fled to one of the self-proclaimed republics in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russian separatists. “No communication, no water, no gas, no light, no water. There was nothing.” The description was echoed by Dmytro Gurin, a Ukrainian MP whose parents were still in the city. “My mom is 67; my dad 69,” he said in a Twitter thread. “The last time I heard from them was day before yesterday at 9am. The conversation lasted 30 seconds. Their phones are dead. Their neighbour had 20% charge left. Yesterday he said they are alive. There is no mobile network any more.” Russian forces continued their offensive in Mykolaiv, opening fire on the city 300 miles south of Kyiv, according to Ukraine’s general staff, while emergency officials in the Kharkiv region said overnight shelling killed at least eight people and wrecked residential buildings, medical, educational and administrative facilities. “Russia continues to carry out rocket, bomb and artillery strikes on the cities and settlements of Ukraine,” the general staff said, and repeated earlier Ukrainian accusations that Russia has targeted humanitarian corridors. The statement also accused Russian forces of taking women and children hostage and placing weapons in residential areas of cities – though it did not elaborate or provide evidence. The accusation came as the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed seven attacks on healthcare infrastructure in Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion, up from four the previous day. The WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Twitter on Sunday that “several” attacks had occurred, without giving details, adding they were a violation of international humanitarian law.

3/8/2022,"Donald Trump’s second attorney general, William Barr, told the former US president he was “like a bull in a bull ring” and “someone’s going to come and put a sword through your head”. In return, Trump called Barr a “horse” who had been “broken” by the radical left. Such was the state of debate in the upper echelons of the Republican party on Monday as it digested the latest round of promotion of Barr’s memoir, One Damn Thing After Another. The book will be published on Tuesday but it has been extensively trailed – including by the Guardian. On the page and in interviews, Barr says Trump is unfit for the presidency and should not be the Republican nominee in 2024. But Barr remains a staunch conservative. On Monday, he told NBC’s Today that despite it all, if Trump was the Republican nominee in 2024, he would vote for him. “Because I believe that the greatest threat to the country is the progressive agenda being pushed by the Democratic party, it’s inconceivable to me that I wouldn’t vote for the Republican nominee,” Barr said. In his book, Barr repeatedly describes disagreements with Trump and tactics used by senior aides including the then secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to distract or obstruct the erratic and often furious president. Speaking to NPR on Monday, Barr repeated a passage in his book when he said: “At one point, I said to [Trump]: ‘You know, Mr President, you’re like a bull in a bull ring and your adversaries have your number. They know how to get under your skin, and all they have to do is wave a red flag over here and you go charging and attack it.’ “And I said, ‘At the end of the day, you’re going to be in the middle of the ring sweating and someone’s going to come and put a sword through your head. “He didn’t think much of that metaphor.” Trump evidently no longer thinks much of Barr. This weekend, the former president wrote a lengthy letter to Lester Holt, an NBC anchor who interviewed Barr on TV. “Bill Barr cares more about the corrupt Washington media and elite than serving the American people,” Trump wrote, as reported by Axios. “He was slow, lethargic, and I realised early on that he never had what it takes to make a great attorney general. When the radical left Democrats threatened to hold him in contempt and even worse, impeach him, he became virtually worthless for law and order and election integrity. They broke him just like a trainer breaks a horse.” Trump also said: “I would imagine that if the book is anything like him, it will be long, slow and very boring.” Critics might disagree. Reviewing the book for the Washington Post, Devlin Barrett said Trump’s second attorney general “was easily [his] most effective and important cabinet member” and Barr’s memoir showed he could “tell a good yarn and has a penchant for deadpan punchlines”. That said, Barrett wrote, Barr had really written “a defense of his tenure to fellow conservatives”. “Barr bided his time before taking one last swing,” Barrett said. “But as long as there are senior officials like Barr, there will be presidents like Trump.” The book has produced a flood of media attention, including charges that Barr is seeking to whitewash his role in some of Trump’s most controversial moments. Barr defends his handling of the investigation of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow. In particular, he focuses on his decision to release a summary of the report by Robert Mueller. In that letter, Barr cleared Trump of seeking to obstruct justice despite the special counsel laying out 10 possible instances of such potentially criminal behavior. Speaking to NBC, Barr repeated his conclusion that Trump’s claims of voter fraud in his defeat by Joe Biden were baseless – he has used the word “bullshit” – while skating over criticism for using the Department of Justice to investigate such lies. He said Trump was “responsible in the broad sense of that word” for the deadly Capitol riot over which he was impeached a second time, for inciting an insurrection. “It appears that part of the plan was to send this group up to the Hill,” Barr said, of the storming of Congress by Trump supporters around which seven people died. “I think the whole idea was to intimidate Congress. And I think that that was wrong.” But he also said: “I haven’t seen anything to say he was legally responsible for it in terms of incitement.” Barr also addressed an incident he left out of his book: the firing of a US attorney, Geoffrey Berman, who was supervising investigations of Trump associates and business affairs as well as an investigation of a Turkish bank which the Turkish president asked Trump to drop. “I didn’t think there was any threat to the president,” Barr told NBC, adding that the decision “was my call”. “I hadn’t really thought much of him,” he said. “I wanted to make the change.”",News/US news,William Barr: Trump is full of bull – but I’ll vote for him,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/07/barr-trump-exchange-blows-book-electoral-lie
3/8/2022,"Statistics can tell the tale of Liverpool’s recovery over the past 12 months – Jürgen Klopp’s team suffered a sixth successive home league defeat one year ago on Monday and host Internazionale on Tuesday aiming for a 13th straight win in all competitions – but Fabinho’s Panenka in the Carabao Cup final paints it better. There is no clearer expression of the confidence flowing through Liverpool than the high-risk plan the Brazilian hatched 24 hours before going eye-to-eye with Kepa Arrizabalaga at Wembley. “The day before I tried to do a Panenka,” the midfielder recalls of his impudent penalty in Liverpool’s shootout success against Chelsea. “It was just me and Luis Díaz, with no goalkeeper in the goal. I told him: ‘Tomorrow if it goes to pens, I will shoot it like this.’ He didn’t believe me. But when I was walking to the box to take the penalty, it was in my mind to shoot a Panenka. When you shoot a penalty like this you know that, if you miss, when you come back to the dressing room everyone will kill you. But it was in my mind that I would take it like this and that I could do it.” Fabinho’s self-belief stands in stark contrast to Liverpool’s confidence level of 12 months ago. Fulham left Anfield with what appeared a precious win in their attempt to avoid relegation, condemning Klopp’s side to the worst home run in Liverpool’s history in the process. It was Fulham’s last Premier League victory of a doomed campaign. It was also the last time Liverpool lost at Anfield. “I remember this game,” Fabinho says. “The confidence of the team was really low, it wasn’t the only game we lost at home. The moment wasn’t good but we won the next game against Leipzig and we started to change it around. Since the start of this season some of the players came back from injury and other things changed as well – I didn’t play centre-back any more! We’ve not had many injuries this season and we’ve won almost every home game, which is important. If you want to fight for the league you have to perform, not just at home, but at home is really important.” The 2-0 win at San Siro three weeks ago flattered the visitors but Liverpool are not complaining. They have never lost a European tie after winning the first leg away from Anfield and have been knocked out of Europe only once when holding a two-goal first-leg advantage. That was against Inter in the 1965 European Cup semi-finals, when Bill Shankly’s team were controversially beaten 3-0 at San Siro having won the first leg 3-1 at home. Klopp, who has Roberto Firmino, Thiago Alcântara and Joël Matip available after recent injuries and illness, said: “It’s a much better result than I would have expected before we played there. The game didn’t look like we’d win 2-0 for most of the time, it was a really tough tie and really difficult game to play. “We knew before they have quality and after that we knew they have real quality. They come here having won 5-0 [against Salernitana on Friday]. It was against the bottom team but it was still really impressive. [Lautaro] Martínez scored, [Edin] Dzeko scored and when I saw the game I’m really happy that [the suspended Nicolò] Barella isn’t playing as he set up three or four goals. That’s a really experienced team and they don’t come here as tourists. They want to chase the game and that’s what we want to do. We aren’t a team that defends results – we want to attack the game again.”",Sport/Football,Fabinho’s high-risk Panenka plan shows Liverpool’s renewed self-belief,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/07/fabinho-says-high-risk-panenka-plan-shows-liverpools-renewed-self-belief
3/8/2022,"A disused Manchester viaduct will transform into an urban “sky park” this summer, providing much needed green space to one of Britain’s least verdant city centres. The National Trust has begun transforming half of the 330-metre long, 56-arch Castlefield Viaduct into a temporary park that is due to open in July and has been compared to New York’s High Line. The park will be planted with trees and shrubs, including Manchester poplars, one of the few species hardy enough to survive the pollution of the Industrial Revolution. The herb comfrey will also be cultivated, once used by mill workers to soothe feet sore from hard days in clogs, as well as the cotton flower, Manchester’s county bloom. There will be raised beds and places to sit, as well as a covered pavilion to provide shelter for those Manchester rainy days, where visitors will be invited to meditate. Though access will initially be limited to 100 free tickets a day, the National Trust hopes the yearlong project will lead to a permanent public space that will eventually expand and be open to all. Duncan Laird, head of urban places at the trust, said the scheme could eventually incorporate a traffic-free walking and cycling route between Deansgate and Cornbrook over a mile away – currently a hairy journey by bike or on foot. For 53 years, Castlefield Viaduct has stood dormant and overgrown, tantalisingly visible to passengers on passing trams and trains but infuriatingly out of bounds to everyone other than the most intrepid graffiti artists. The Grade II-listed structure was built in 1892 after a period of “railway mania”, in which commercial speculation and competition for routes led to the rapid construction of lines and expansion of the railway network. By 1939, the bridge carried 11 million passengers and 85 million tonnes of goods a year from Chester and Liverpool to Manchester. The line shut in 1969 with the closure of Manchester Central station, now home to party political conferences, with trains diverted instead to Piccadilly and Oxford Road stations. Hilary McGrady, director-general of the National Trust, said Covid had highlighted the importance of urban green space. “The pandemic showed us the importance of our local parks and gardens, but it also highlighted significant inequalities in access to green space in urban areas like Manchester,” she said. “By working with others, we aim to increase access to parks and green spaces in, around and near urban areas, so eventually everyone is in easy reach of quiet places for reflection with wide open skies.” The trust has raised two-thirds of the £1.8m project cost via public donations and the People’s Postcode Lottery, and will be fundraising for the rest. The Castlefield Sky Park is part of a renaissance of Manchester’s old railway lines. Several nearby railway arches will soon be turned into Embassy Village, a purpose-built facility for homeless people, while others have become home to breweries and other small businesses. The rapidly expanding city is notably short of green space, although another urban park, Mayfield, which includes a giant slide, is due to open next year next to Piccadilly. New York’s 2.3km High Line, completed in 2014, kickstarted a global trend for turning disused railway lines into parks. But while “doing a High Line” has become lazy shorthand for fashioning anything vaguely parklike out of an urban space, the Castlefield Sky Park does follow a similar blueprint, being both high up and on a railway line. A similar project is in the planning stages in Camden, north London. The Camden High Line will be 1.2km long, about 8 metres above ground, and connect Camden Gardens in the west to York Way in the east.",News/UK news,Manchester viaduct to become an urban ‘sky park’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/07/manchester-viaduct-to-become-an-urban-sky-park
3/8/2022,"A western embargo on Russian oil and gas is no longer unthinkable after the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, revealed that the idea was gaining traction in the White House and had been the subject of “very active discussion” with allies. The reaction was dramatic, with Brent crude oil hitting levels not seen since 2008, while gas soared to all-time highs as traders considered whether it could be thrown into the mix too. Pushback from Germany’s new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, came as no surprise given his country’s heavy reliance on Russian oil and gas. “Supplying Europe with energy for heat generation, mobility, electricity supply and industry cannot be secured in any other way at the moment,” he said. Meanwhile, consumers’ money is funding the war in Ukraine. EU oil purchases alone are putting $285m (£217m) a day into Russian pockets, according to the Brussels-based NGO Transport Environment. So how realistic is a ban and how high could prices go? Up to 40% of Europe’s gas comes from Russia, a reliance that has already been in sharp focus during the colder winter months. As warmer days arrive and the immediate need for gas diminishes, it should be remembered that the picture is not all that different for crude oil and other petroleum products. About 5m barrels per day (bpd) flow out of Russia, the world’s second largest exporter after Saudi Arabia. About half goes to the EU, which relies on Russia for 27% of its imports and about 15% of its total consumption. The UK is less dependent, importing 4.7m tonnes of Russian oil in 2021, just under 100,000 bpd, which was less than 10% of consumption. But, as with gas, the UK cannot escape the impact of global market prices for commodities, which would filter through into much higher costs for ordinary people. Solving the gas conundrum is tough enough, involving a combination of increased production from elsewhere, reducing demand, buying more liquefied natural gas (LNG) and pushing harder on renewables and nuclear. Throwing oil into the bargain only adds to the headache. “A disruption on such a massive scale cannot be met by other producers, at least not for the foreseeable future,” said Ole Hansen of Saxo Bank. One option under discussion is for the US to lift sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. “Iran could add about 1.3m bpd of additional oil into the market,” said Sophie Udubasceanu, a global crude oil expert at ICIS. But she warned that contribution from Venezuela relied on the country solving persistent output problems. America’s own reserves offer some hope. The US exported 3.45m bpd in December last year and could increase that. None of this could happen quickly. “Raising production from these producers would take months for Iran, quarters for the US and years for Venezuela,” said Hansen. Another route is to convince Opec, the cartel of oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia, to loosen the taps. Only last week though, with the Ukraine invasion in full swing, Opec stuck to a meagre 400,000 bpd increase. It depends on the geopolitical reality. The all-time high is $147.50, set in July 2008, and some analysts think it could go higher. The UBS commodity analyst Giovanni Staunovo said a prolonged war could take the price above that record, to $150 or more. Analysts at Bank of America said that if most of Russia’s oil exports were cut off, the resulting 5m bpd shortfall could push prices as high as $200. A huge increase in the cost of everything from petrol at the pumps to any goods transported by road, adding to sky-high inflation and the cost-of-living crisis. There is a saying that the best cure for a high price is a high price, a reference to the concept of demand destruction. If oil gets so expensive that people cannot afford it, they stop buying and the price comes down again. However, that most likely means measures such as industrial shutdowns, causing a significant downturn in economic activity and, very probably, recession. The Ukraine crisis has highlighted the importance of switching to sustainable energy sources, not just to address the climate crisis. Jim Watson, a professor of energy policy and the director of the UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources, said: “We urgently need to a new programme to upgrade and insulate our homes after a decade of inaction and poorly designed policies. The [UK] government should also keep its foot on the renewables accelerator – and continue to expand investment in low-cost sources of electricity such as solar and wind.” While this approach would reduce reliance on Russia, it would take some years to come to fruition – potentially even longer than finding new supplies of gas and oil. There are no easy answers.",News/Business,How important is Russian oil and how high could prices go?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/07/how-important-is-russian-oil-and-how-high-could-prices-go
3/8/2022,"Fort Lauderdale’s now-former police chief has hit back at officials in the Florida city who fired him after just six months on the job, accusing him of focusing too heavily on a diversity policy in hiring and promotion. Larry Scirotto, 48, the son of a white mother and Black father and the department’s first openly gay chief, was fired last Thursday after a city report related examples such as how he had once pointed to a display of photos of the department’s command staff in a conference room and said: “That wall is too white” and “I’m gonna change that.” But in an interview with Miami’s 7News, Scirotto denied that he had made promotions based on minority-status. “The promotions I made of minority candidates were because they were exceptional candidates who excelled at every level of the organization, who deserved to be promoted and who were, by the way, happened to be minority – not because they were minority.” Scirotto was sworn-in as police chief in mid-August last year. By November, the city had hired a law firm to investigate complaints. CNN obtained a copy of the report that also said Scirotto had overlooked a white man with 20 years tenure with the department, and instead narrowed the choice for a job between two men of color, and asked: “Which one is blacker?” Interviewed by officials, Scirotto denied asking which candidate was “blacker” when deciding on the promotion, but admitted to making comments about the wall of staff photos being “too white” because, he felt, it did not reflect the ethnically diverse community the police department serves. The report said that Scirotto had responded that the context of his comment had been “built around ‘how do I convince the community that we are an inclusive and diverse organization if this wall is so white?’” It cited 21 witnesses on Scirotto’s hiring and promotion practices. The report concluded that “most believed that Chief Scirotto made clear his intention to promote based on race, gender or sexual orientation” and that “almost every witness was dissatisfied” with Scirotto’s approach to promotions. “Some believed it was about time changes were made, but stated if promotions were based on things such as race it would even hurt or undermine the people promoted,” the report said. But Scirotto warned that “minority groups are now being treated as less than deserving. That’s not the case, and it never was.” He told CNN the report that triggered his termination from the department was “vague on the facts”. In a statement the city said it had decided to cut ties with the police chief, who was not on a contract, saying: “After a thorough and extensive investigation of employee complaints at the Fort Lauderdale Police Department, City Manager Chris Lagerbloom has determined that it is in the City’s best interest to separate employment with Larry Scirotto.” Scirotto joined the department after the Fort Lauderdale police were hit by accusations of internal turmoil and use of excessive force after officers fired rubber bullets and teargas into a crowd protesting the 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white police officer in Minneapolis, which sparked civil rights protests across the country and internationally. Scirotto spent more than two decades as a police officer in Pittsburgh, and was initially welcomed in the Florida post as an outsider untouched by cronyism. “I have a vision for the department,” Scirotto said at the time. “There are things we can do better. I know we don’t release the data publicly in a way I want to, so the public can see when we use force and the outcome of that force.” Police union chiefs were cautious. “The department is not broken,” said the union president, Brandon Diaz. “It doesn’t need fixing. “It’s a wait-and-see attitude,” Diaz added. “The fact that he’s an external candidate leaves some unknowns. You don’t know what he’s going to bring, or what his vision is and how he’s going to move the department forward.” Among reforms Scirotto planned was to create a multi-cultural liaison unit to expand officers’ roles as liaisons to key groups that have traditionally been marginalized and undeserved. “I watched George Floyd in horror like hopefully every other law enforcement professional in America did,” he told the Sun Sentinel. “This is not a moment in time. This is a movement. We must change our tactics, our strategy, our training and the way we are accountable to the public for our actions.” Soon after being hired, Scirotto promoted 15 officers – nine were white men, six were minorities through ethnicity or gender. Four who were not selected for promotion – three men and one woman – filed complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. “There would have been 12 white men, one white woman and two minorities if I had promoted as the complainants say I should have,” Scirotto told the paper. “Damned if you do, damned if you don’t. What would the optics have been on that?” Fort Lauderdale officials have indicated the city could rescind promotions made on Scirotto’s watch. But the former police chief has said he plans to maintain his position on the issue. “If I die on the hill for promoting diversity, as I was charged by the city manager to do from the day I was hired, then I will sleep well at night,” he told the South Florida Sun Sentinel.",News/US news,Fort Lauderdale ex-police chief hits back after being fired over diversity promotions ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/07/fort-lauderdale-ex-police-chief-fired-diversity-promotions
3/8/2022,"My friend Paul Martin, who has died aged 73 of pancreatic cancer, was a painter whose work was rooted in nature: preoccupied by the “scratchy, tough reality of things”. But his locations, and the figures which sometimes peopled them, were more metaphorical than representational: familiar but also otherworldly. Born in Bournemouth, Paul was the son of Alice (nee Moland), a secretary, and John Martin, a hydro-electric engineer, who died when Paul was 10. Paul grew up in Rugby, Warwickshire, and went to Dunsmore school, where he excelled at sport, leading a national schoolboy gymnastics team on a tour of Austria in 1964. He also joined an early incarnation of the Rugby-based pop band, Pinkerton’s Assorted Colours, as its drummer – without him, they went on to score an unlikely Top 10 hit with Mirror, Mirror in 1966. However, Paul’s abiding love was art, leading him to study painting at Birmingham School of Art and the Royal Academy. While still a student in 1971, he met Sandra Collins, then studying English at the University of Manchester. They were engaged within a week, married within the year, and stayed together for more than 50 years. Following his studies, and with a growing family, he became art master at Rugby school, a position he held for 20 years. Doc Martin – as he was universally known – inspired many of his students to become artists in their own right. Possessed of enormous energy, he continued to paint and exhibit, making a name for himself with large, often semi-narrative paintings, with themes and figures drawn eclectically from the Bible, ancient mythology and contemporary life. The encrusted, scarred surfaces of his pictures matched the imagery. Over the years Paul’s evolving Christian faith led him from the strict, evangelical Baptist tradition of his youth to an immersion in the much older tradition of Orthodoxy: finding a home in its rich iconographic heritage and liturgical forms. This was echoed in his paintings, whose distinctiveness spoke to a growing number of collectors, including the Royal Academy, the British Museum and the BBC. After his retirement from Rugby school, the final 10 years of his teaching career were spent at the Leith School of Art in Edinburgh. During this period, the human figure disappeared from his paintings, and he became preoccupied with the physical landscape, without surrendering to the picturesque. He drew inspiration from thinkers such as Duns Scotus, Rainer Maria Rilke and Teilhard de Chardin, with whom he shared an intuition that God was somehow present in the very fabric, the materiality of creation. In his last year, figures tentatively made their way back into the picture frame. Paul was – to the end – alive to new horizons, new possibilities. He is survived by Sandra, their sons, Thomas, Henry and Ben, and five grandchildren.",Arts/Art and design,Paul Martin obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/07/paul-martin-obituary

He was born in Oxford to Dorothy (nee Hudson), a teacher, and Andrew Gilchrist, a chemical engineer. The family lived in Cheshire for his first few years and then moved to Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire. The eldest of five children, he went to St Albans school and then Magdalen College, Oxford, taking a degree in philosophy and psychology. Friendship with an Iranian lodger encouraged Ian to travel to Iran after graduating in 1976, and he taught English at the University of Tehran, exploring a new landscape of mountains and deserts. The Iranian revolution forced him to leave three years later, after which he found work with the British Council in Ljubljana, then in Yugoslavia and now in Slovenia. There he met a local woman, Gordana Djokic. After Ian had a brief spell teaching English in Saudi Arabia, they married in 1981 and lived in Ljubljana, where he translated material for the Unesco Centre for Chemical Education, until they came to the UK in 1983 and settled in Bath, Somerset. Ian and Gordana lived in Bath for the rest of their lives, raising their two sons, Robert and James, while Ian worked as a salesman for a software company, Cifer, in Melksham, before doing the same for IPL in Bath, taking early retirement in 2013. He joined the Lib Dems in 2003, and represented Widcombe ward in Bath as a councillor for 12 years until 2019. He was also elected chair of Bath and North East Somerset council before becoming mayor.

3/8/2022,"My friend Claire Watkins was an American who devoted more than 30 years to education in Wales after moving to Newport in the 1970s. As headteacher of Maindee infants school, Newport, in the 80s, she encouraged bilingualism, training other schools in the Joan Tough teaching methodologies. Maindee was the first infant school to obtain the Schools’ Curriculum Award, established in 1982 by the Society of Education Officers and the editorial advisory panel of Education magazine to celebrate curriculum design and teaching. Claire then became part of the Gwent county staff development unit in 1991, initially as an adviser to nursery and primary schools. In the late 90s she undertook training to be an inspector of primary schools for Estyn, the Welsh equivalent of Ofsted. Born in Houston, Texas, Claire was the daughter of Emma (nee Vestal) and Emile Emmott, a banker. She attended Bellaire high school in Houston and then Baylor University in Waco, where she obtained her BA in elementary education and English in 1963. After graduation she moved to California and married her childhood sweetheart, Alfred Hildebrand, who was studying at Stanford University, in 1964. In 1967 they moved to Darmstadt, Germany, for Alfred’s work, and Claire taught primary level children at the American military school there. After two years they returned to California, where they adopted Elizabeth and Adam. Claire’s children attended a preschool at Stanford University that was underpinned by active research into child development by the likes of Jerome Bruner and Lilian Katz. Their work greatly influenced Claire; she later brought Katz to Wales as part of the continuing professional development of teachers. Her marriage to Alfred ended in divorce, and after Claire met Richard Watkins, a Welshman who was coaching rugby at Stanford, she moved to Newport when he returned home to study film. They married in 1974 and divorced in 1988. Claire worked in several Newport primary schools; she often spoke of her time at St Julian’s infants school, and she was deputy headteacher at Alway infants school. I first met Claire at Maindee in 1988, while looking for schools for my children. A qualified primary teacher myself, I was so impressed by Claire that I offered to volunteer at the school for an afternoon a week. In the next term a vacancy came up in the school for a reception class teacher and Claire strongarmed me into applying. She became a firm friend and a mentor in my career. After being brought up as a southern Baptist, Claire encountered the Quakers through her husband’s family and became a devout member.

3/8/2022,"“Diego isn’t here any more, Robert Moreno is,” Robert Moreno said, but now he has gone too, Granada announcing that they had sacked their coach in a brief statement released at 12.37am on Saturday shortly after landing from Valencia. Eighteen minutes later, the B-team coach Rubén Torrecilla was named as his replacement. Moreno hadn’t lasted long – it is five-and-a-half months since that line, tone set early, and six-and-a-half since his first game – but it was longer than he had ever lasted before and longer than many expected, or wanted. Two days on, no-one has said goodbye. When he left the training ground on Sunday, Moreno did so quietly. He had taken charge of 29 games at Granada, 27 in the league and two in the cup, which at least was 13 more than his previous job, at Monaco. He was in the job before that, his first as head coach, for nine matches but those had been successful and his departure was supposed to be good news even for him. Assistant at the selección, he was made Spain’s caretaker until his friend Luis Enrique felt ready to return following his daughter’s diagnosis with cancer. There came a point when he didn’t seem to see it that way, though, which is why his tenure ended the way it did, in tears. That time, they were only his. When he left Monaco, he claimed that he found players and staff crying at the news that he wasn’t going to continue. This time, there are none. Granada have not won this year, picking up three points from nine, Saturday’s 3-1 loss at Mestalla their sixth in seven games. They are a single pointabove the relegation zone and were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Atlético Mancha Real, a team currently battling relegation from the regional, fourth-tier Segunda RFEF division. But that’s not the only reason there was something oddly inevitable about this almost from the start, why his brief spell in charge might have been briefer, one paper describing the “chronicle of a sacking foretold”. The eighth manager sacked in primera this season could have been the first. Something never really felt right, even with the early optimism. Employed by the board before the new sporting director had arrived, the personal choice of director general Patricia Rodríguez, Moreno replaced Diego Martínez, which was some cross to bear. Martínez, the most successful manager the club ever had, brought them up and led them into Europe for the first time ever, reaching the quarter-finals and a meeting with Manchester United. Impossibly energetic, charismatic and hugely popular, he had built a team that was very much his. And even though he studiously stayed away, refusing to set foot in the stadium or be seen anywhere near it, heading to England at one point, Rodríguez admitted the former coach cast a “long shadow”. Following him wasn’t going to be easy. Moreno knew that, which was part of the reason it was even harder for him. “This team reached the summit, now it has to leap for the moon,” Moreno told Ideal not long after arriving. While survival was the objective, he said they would look to Europe too, suggesting that this team could be better than that one. More stylish, purer, a better football team. Instead, Granada were soon heading downhill. They didn’t wake up until September ended, finally collecting their first win at the start of October by beating Sevilla. The problem was that Granada only won one of the next seven, and it wasn’t even just that: it was him. Two goals in quick succession for Valencia! 🔥Gonçalo Guedes opened the scoring with this header before Maxi Gomez added another soon after 🦇 pic.twitter.com/ucEVDgBmn3 Even if you couldn’t quite put your finger on why, you wondered how long he would last as early as August. When fans started chanting “Robert, vete ya!” – “Robert, go now” – fewer than seven games into the season, you thought he really might be gone soon. And nor was it just results: it was something simpler, something almost too basic. He just didn’t feel like he belonged, like he was theirs. Moreno hadn’t exactly been given time and as the song went round, there was an ironic smile that made it worse. Afterwards, swivelling in his chair, shrugging a “so?”, he reminded them that Martínez wasn’t coming back. When Luis Enrique returned to the Spain job after the tragic death of his daughter, taking over from Moreno again, he publicly attacked his former assistant and now former friend for being “disloyal” and “over-ambitious”, immediately ditching him from his staff as he kept the rest. Moreno had initially said that he would be delighted to step aside but, after seven wins and two draws in nine games, he had started to think he might lead them into the Euros – and suggested that Luis Enrique wait. “Life shows you who people are,” Luis Enrique said of Moreno. “He labelled me with two very ugly things that I don’t deserve. I am not that,” Moreno insisted. He was probably right, but perhaps that lingered, conditioned the way he was seen. When he went to Monaco, he said that he had offers from “the five continents” but, interrupted by the pandemic, it didn’t work out. At Granada there was something in his attempts to distance himself from Martínez that felt almost dismissive, and fans who saw a man not so much trying to step out of Martínez’s shadow as fight his way out – and they didn’t much appreciate the punches thrown. They detected a hint of superiority that may not have been fair but they couldn’t help feeling it. Young, handsome, proud, they saw something a little chulo in him: chest out, jaw out too, pouting and defiant, defensive. At one press conference in December, the tension came to the surface. Asked about opponents Atlético, he replied: “I don’t have to answer that.” What about the four-four-two which seems to be going well, he was asked: “That’s why I use it.” Asked how defender Quini was: “You have to ask him.” Will you rotate? “Tomorrow you’ll see.” The next day he apologised, insisting: “I’m a human and I make mistakes … it was not my best day for personal reasons,” he said, noting that he had been trending on Twitter. All of which was fair enough – it is a miracle that players and managers don’t get shirty more often – but there wasn’t a great deal of warmth, even when they were winning. Which by then they were. That day, they defeated Atlético – part of a run of seven without defeat, equalling a club record. If there was a feeling that patience may have been rewarded, that they had found their feet, the manager accepting petitions to be more pragmatic, somehow there was still something they were not sure of, little affection. And then, despite spending €10m in the winter, they stopped winning again. Atlético was their last victory, and that was nine games ago. And so it ends, early but later than it might have done, resistance from the club’s ownership in China finally overcome after a couple of weeks on edge and a season that never truly felt secure. Granada have won only five league games from 27. On Saturday the captain Germán Sánchez insisted that the players believed in Moreno but no one has said anything since, no farewell and no thanks. The wife of Luis Abram, currently out on loan, declared: “At last! I’m sure better things will come.” Alavés 0-0 SevillaReal Madrid 4-1 Real SociedadValencia 3-1 GranadaEspanyol 2-0 GetafeOsasuna 1-0 VillarrealReal Betis 1-3 Atlético MadridCelta Vigo 4-3 Real MallorcaElche 1-2 BarcelonaCádiz 2-0 Rayo Vallecano They have to: next up, Granada face Elche, four points ahead of them, and Alavés, who are three points behind. “New manager, guaranteed victory,” the line goes and they had to try something. Besides, it has worked for others, not just at Barcelona but at the bottom, too. Levante went from no wins in eight to no wins in 15 when they changed from Paco López to Javier Pereira, but have a weensy bit of a chance now with Alessio Lisci in charge. There’s a glimpse of hope emerging at Alavés who have won one and drawn two of their last four under José Luis Mendilíbar. Under Fran Escribá, Elche won two of 14 and were 18th; under Francisco, they’ve won five and are five points clear of the relegation zone. Cádiz, who sacked Álvaro Cervera, are one point from safety having just won a top-flight game in front of their home fans for the first time since 2006. And Quique Sánchez Flores has performed a miracle at Getafe. At the same time as Getafe sacked Míchel and Levante bade farewell to Paco López, with fans singing for Robert to “go now” and many wondering if that might not be a bad idea, Granada won their first game of the season. “A liberation,” Moreno called it, but it didn’t last and now he has gone too.",Sport/Football,"Granada shed no tears for Moreno, the man who lost his battle with a shadow | Sid Lowe",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/07/la-liga-granada-roberto-moreno-diego-martinez
3/8/2022,"One of the ironies of the war in Ukraine is that the Kremlin’s finances benefit every time the crisis deepens. After Saudi Arabia, Russia is the second biggest exporter of crude oil, and it is out on its own as an exporter of natural gas. Countries producing more oil and gas than they consume enjoy windfall gains when prices rise – and Russia falls into that category. Conversely, countries not self-sufficient in energy suffer when prices are high because costs for business rise and consumer spending power is squeezed. There is a lively debate about whether the US is self-sufficient in energy, but it is certainly a lot less dependent on imports than the European Union, which gets 40% of its natural gas from Russia. Europe is a lot more vulnerable to a loss of Russian energy supplies than the US, and that helps explain why the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is more cautious than Washington over extending the west’s sanctions regime to oil and gas – at least for now. After Antony Blinken, Joe Biden’s secretary of state, sent prices rocketing by saying the US and its allies were actively considering adding oil and gas to the sanctions list, Scholz said Russian energy was “essential” to Europeans’ daily lives. Boris Johnson also expressed caution, making it clear that a ratcheting-up of sanctions to include oil and gas could not happen overnight. The prime minister’s warning came as the cost of unleaded petrol on UK forecourts hit 155p a litre, according to the RAC. The International Monetary Fund is concerned about the impact of energy prices on a global economy still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic, with the fear that the hit to demand in energy-consuming countries will not be offset by a increase in spending by energy producers. The economic consequences are already “very serious”, it says. At the start of 2022, the EU was paying €190m a day for the natural gas it received from Russia, but by the end of last week this daily figure had risen to €610m. The further increase in gas prices since means the bill will now be even higher. It is a similar story for oil, where in early trading the cost of a barrel of Brent crude briefly reached $139 – within striking distance of its record high of $147 a barrel in 2008. On some estimates, Europe is paying $285m a day for Russian oil. Nick Parsons, head of research for the renewable energy company Thomas Lloyd, said that in sterling terms, oil prices (unadjusted for inflation) were higher now than 14 years ago, owing to a lower exchange rate. In 2008, with the pound worth $2, a barrel of oil cost £73; at the current exchange rate of $1.31, it costs £106 a barrel. It remains to be seen whether Russia is actually reaping the full benefit of rising prices. Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, says sanctions are already having a marked impact on cross-border transactions, including as yet untouched oil and gas exports. Evidence for that, Shearing says, comes from the price differential between Brent crude – one of the global benchmarks – and Urals crude, the main Russian export blend. Before the invasion, Urals crude traded at an average discount of $2-$3 a barrel, but that has subsequently widened to almost $25 a barrel. With the rouble hitting fresh lows against the US dollar, Russia is already feeling the impact of sanctions. But so too – in the economic version of mutually assured destruction – is the west.",News/Business,West feeling impact of Russia sanctions too as oil and gas prices soar | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/07/west-impact-russia-sanctions-oil-gas
3/8/2022,"Three more Russian billionaires have resigned from the board of the $22bn (£17bn) investment firm LetterOne after the EU imposed sanctions on its two biggest shareholders. The company, which owns the health retail chain Holland & Barrett in the UK and a swathe of energy assets across Europe, said on Monday that German Khan, Alexei Kuzmichev and Andrei Kosogov had “resigned from all positions at LetterOne, including the board”. It said: “None of these three individuals has been sanctioned, but they believe that this is the right thing to do in the long-term interests of LetterOne, its employees and the many jobs it supports in its portfolio companies.” Last week the UK-based Russian billionaire oligarchs Mikhail Fridman, LetterOne’s founder, and Petr Aven, who between them own just under 50% of LetterOne, had their shares in the company “frozen” after they were hit with EU sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The pair then stepped down from the London-based investment group. Mervyn Davies, the company’s chair and a former Labour trade minister, said he was determined to stay on at L1, despite repeated calls for him to step down. “The new board and I will focus on protecting the enormous economic and social contribution LetterOne makes,” Lord Davies said. “I am also determined to ensure that the 120,000 jobs throughout the UK, US and Europe are protected. We know that everyone involved in L1, including our founders, would want us to take these steps given their love and passion for and heritage in Ukraine.” Tom Tugendhat, a Conservative MP and the chair of the foreign affairs committee, told the Mail on Sunday that Davies should step down. “Some moments demand a choice, this is one,” he said. Davies said LetterOne would make a $150m donation to “support the urgent work under way to help those affected by the war in Ukraine”. The company said: “We know that everyone at LetterOne, including our founders, support this action. LetterOne’s shareholders have also agreed that all dividends from LetterOne will be paid to ongoing relief efforts for the foreseeable future.” Khan, who was born in Ukraine and helped to found LetterOne, said: “The majority of LetterOne founders have deep roots in Ukraine and the destruction of the cities where I spent my childhood and which are home to the graves of our ancestors is heartbreaking. The recent bombing of the Babyn Yar Holocaust memorial centre, which we funded and helped create, feels inconceivable. “My partners and I stand for the earliest end to war and will do all we can to help those affected – whether employees of our businesses in Ukraine, or victims of the violence. We fully support the board’s actions in this matter.” Fridman and Aven were placed on the EU sanctions list last week but are not under UK or US sanctions. Fridman was described by the EU as “a top Russian financier and enabler of Putin’s inner circle”. Aven was described by the EU as “one of Vladimir Putin’s closest oligarchs” and an “especially close personal friend” of the Rosneft chief executive, Igor Sechin. “He is one of approximately 50 wealthy Russian businessmen who regularly meet with Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin,” the EU document said. The men have denied any “financial or political relationship with President Putin or the Kremlin” and said they would “contest the spurious and unfounded basis for the imposition of these sanctions – vigorously and through all means available to them.” Fridman, who was listed as the UK’s 11th wealthiest person in the Sunday Times Rich List with an estimated £11bn fortune, owns Athlone House, a £65m mansion in Highgate, north London. Aven, who has an estimated $5.5bn fortune, owns Ingliston House, near Virginia Water, on 8.5 acres of land in a gated estate next to Wentworth golf course. It boasts an art collection including works by Larionov, Goncharova and Kandinsky, as well as sculptures by Louise Bourgeois, Henry Moore and Antony Gormley in the garden.",News/Business,Three more Russian billionaires resign from LetterOne board,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/07/three-more-russian-billionaires-resign-from-letterone-board
