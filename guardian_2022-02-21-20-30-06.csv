2/21/2022,"Rob Halford (vocals, Judas Priest): That first Monsters of Rock [in 1980] was an extraordinary day. It was the first metal festival. And it kicked off a whole experience, not just in the UK but in Europe. Paul Loasby (promoter, Monsters of Rock): [US promoter] Bill Graham had used the name Monsters of Rock. We spoke to Bill: “Do you mind if we use that name?” He said he didn’t. I think he’d pinched it as well.  Dante Bonutto (writer, Record Mirror and Kerrang!): You were in a field with lots of other people who loved what you loved, so it was very empowering and defining. It gave enormous impetus to the fact that rock was more than just a collection of individual bands – it was a whole movement, an international force. Many people also picked sides: I was with some journalists from Melody Maker who absolutely hated it, while I was absolutely loving it. Paul Loasby: I was with [concert promoter] Harvey Goldsmith for four years, and there’s always the itching belief that you can make it on your own. Reading had moved more and more to hard rock, but it was still a mixture. It had lost its identity, and the audience drop-off was quite significant. I got out a map, and went: Birmingham, M6, M1, and drew a triangle: Castle Donington racetrack. This was March 1980. I looked at my map, and fuck me, it’s next to an airport. I’d always dreamed that helicopters would fly into the airport and the artists would collect their cars to go backstage. I didn’t think about aeroplanes taking off and drowning out the sound. In my mind metal would drown it out. I didn’t realise the runway was just over the fence from the racetrack. Neal Kay (DJ, promoter, impresario): By then, promoters had realised rock fans were never going to settle for a mixed bill. Not in this country. No bloody way. We’re like that. Rock is a way of life. It is not just music. Paul Loasby: I rang Bruce Payne, Rainbow’s manager, and said, “Suppose I got a heavy metal festival together and made you an offer? I know Ritchie Blackmore hates open-airs, but what do you think?” He said, “Yeah, we’ll do it.” It was obviously the money. We were told the farmers were amenable to helping out with car parking because they were used to it from the racing. The following day was a vintage car race, but we thought they would just cry off. So by the third week of March it looked as though everything was fine. Payne wanted his other act Touch opening, and Judas Priest said yes pretty quickly, so did Scorpions. We hoped we would get 50,000 [people]. We wanted to break even at 30,000. However, because it was done the way it was we were not in control of some of the aspects – such as the cost of the police. But also, the “fuck factor” as you’d call it, is the miscellaneous. It rained and it rained and it rained [beforehand], so suddenly your trackway [temporary road] costs and your straw costs rise. We ended up with just under 36,000. A quick piece of maths showed that we’d lost money, but it wasn’t horrible. Allan Jones (writer, Melody Maker): The previous night Rainbow had a full-scale dress rehearsal, which included their pyrotechnics. They wanted to end their set with some huge explosion, so they’d brought a ton of fucking gelignite or something and it had accidentally gone off. It blew out Judas Priest’s entire backline as I remember, buckled some of the lighting rigs, nearly killed a load of people who were sitting backstage. So as we arrived we were given a document to sign, indemnifying Rainbow and the promoters in the event of injury or death, however caused. So that was a sobering start to the day. Neal Kay: I had to go up there and do sound check and stuff the day before. Went up there in my Jag. That was something I learned from doing the Hammersmith Odeon: you turn up in a Ford and the old boy around the back never even raises the barrier, you drive up there in an XJ6, no problem, they think you’re one of the band. We got called at night to do a little sound check [for DJing and announcing the bands] – back then I was right on the front of the stage at one side, not hidden away. Didn’t sleep the night before – I watched Jimmy Bain [formerly of Rainbow], pissed out of his head, fall into the fireplace at the hotel. Andy Copping (fan, Download festival booker/promoter): I was 17 or 18, living in Lincolnshire. There was a group of friends from Lincoln, six of us, all huge rock music fans. We went in an open-topped Jeep, all piling in the back, with sandwiches, beer. It felt like we were going to Vegas, somewhere really special: all these amazing bands we all loved, all on one bill, all on one day. The weather was glorious sunshine, and when we were driving down, on one of the roads as we got close to the site, there was an AA sign that said “Pop festival”. We were all freaking out, going, “This isn’t a pop festival, this is a ROCK festival!” We were outraged. Mark Mangold (keyboards, Touch): It looked like Woodstock – the hill goes up. Cozy Powell [Rainbow drummer] rode motorcycles, and I know he took a couple of spins around the track before the gig. Paul Loasby: Don’t ask me why, but we forgot to put water on site. There weren’t any bars because we weren’t allowed to sell alcohol. All we had was orange juice, Coca-Cola and whatever. But you could bring in plastic, so you could see huge plastic containers full of beer or wine or whatever. Andy Copping: We walked up, went in through the gate, and then had to cross over the racetrack. That itself was an experience. We came to the brow of the hill and looked down – I’m getting shivers telling you this now – over the hill across this sea of people. Thousands upon thousands of people, and you could see the stage at the front with scrims either side with the Rainbow album cover covering the speakers. And I’m like: “Oh my God.” Every single person there was me. Thousands of carbon copies of me. For a small-town boy from Lincoln, this was the most incredible experience. And suddenly we were all talking to each other – someone else would turn out to have been at a gig you’d been to at Stafford Bingley Hall or Leeds Queens Hall. One of the things that resonated with me more than anything was that although this was tribalism, it was one tribe. It wasn’t like football, where there’s someone from another town and they ain’t into your team. This was a total community. I also remember the queue for the one burger van – it was just insane – and honest to God, I don’t remember seeing a toilet. Graham Bonnet (vocals, Rainbow): It seemed very groovy and posh and wonderful. It felt absolutely massive. And it almost didn’t matter what the stage was like. It was the audience that made the show – and they always do. That day was probably the best day I’ve ever spent in music. Nothing went wrong. Mark Mangold: It was magical. It was a question of getting out there to the crowd. They don’t turn up all the faders for an opening band – very often they’ll put a piece of tape on the fader on the mixing board and say, ‘“If you move it beyond this, you will die.” But we did our best. Jennie Halsall (publicist for Rainbow and Monsters of Rock): A wasp flew into the mouth of the singer from Touch when they were on stage, and he had to be carted off. There was a lot of speculation about whether that was false or not, but it absolutely wasn’t. It was mad. Dante Bonutto: The singer swallowed a bee. He carried on. Mark Mangold: It was Doug Howard, our bassist. He had a beer and was going back to his amp, and took a chug, and there was a bee in there. Allan Jones: After enduring their set I was rather hoping it was the fucking singer. Paul Loasby: Donington didn’t know this, but the drainage system for the bowl stopped halfway down. So all the water bubbled up about 100ft in front of the stage, where this river of mud started flowing, underneath the right PA stack. So the stage sank on the right. It was quite severe – something like a foot. On a stage a 100ft wide that’s some decline. Jennie Halsall: First of all, they put the stage in the wrong place. Second, it absolutely pissed down. It was a Glastonbury, mud everywhere, in front of the stage it was about a foot deep. Also, I had not experienced pee in plastic bottles before. Seeing these bottles of yellow being thrown around in front of the stage and thinking, “Urgh, how disgusting,” because the guys at the front of the stage were not going to move. Andy Copping: Oh my God, the bottle fights. We can laugh at it now, but it must have been horrific for anyone who got injured. The sight of all these cans and bottles and apple cores and orange peel … anything was being thrown in the air between bands. The bottle fights at Donington ran for years, but that was all part of the festive spirit. Some people would feel, “If I get covered in mud, that means I’ve been to a festival. If I get covered in piss, then that means I’ve arrived.” Steve Dawson (bass, Saxon): You go up the stairs to the stage, and you could see ’em as far as the eye could see. And there’s only one thing crossing your mind: “Fucking hell, I hope I don’t fuck up.” They announce your name, you go on, there’s a deafening roar, and it starts. And you go into automatic pilot then. It’s like you’re not there. It’s like you’re just doing something and it’s over in a split second, and you come off, and everyone’s patting you on the back, saying how great it were, you really killed it. And you go back to the dressing room, and there, stood at the top of them fucking stairs is Rob Halford in his full regalia. Hat, sunglasses, whip, studs from head to foot. And it were like: “Fucking hell!” Biff Byford (vocals, Saxon): We were selling shitloads of albums, of Wheels of Steel. By the time we walked on stage, though, we were the underdogs because all the other bands on there had at least three albums on us and maybe five, some of them. But it was a great day. I don’t think anyone could have foreseen how well we went down. We did very fast, aggressive, songs, not like the other bands. KK Downing (guitar, Judas Priest): I was a bit disappointed we weren’t headlining. And I thought Rainbow, with wotsit in the suit [Graham Bonnet] and all that, weren’t what they were. Rob Halford: I felt a little bit anxious before we went on: it was a big deal. We knew this was a very exciting opportunity to make a strong metal statement. It was the beginning of something that was going to exponentially grow and become part of the metal world. Neal Kay: I made one of the worst mistakes of my life. I can’t remember the number Priest had played, but it was right at the end of their set. The next thing, I see the stage crew moving in and moving all their backline away. So I said: “Right, you lot, round of applause for Judas Priest!” The place went absolutely nutty. Their manager rushed up and said, “Hey, they’re supposed to do an encore. You should have waited to be told.” That was my fuck-up. I was made acutely aware of the fact and I felt very bad. Andy Copping: For me, Saxon, Scorpions and Judas Priest totally got it. They went out there and just ripped the crowd apart from the minute they came on to the minute they went off. Dante Bonutto: Saxon wrote that song And the Bands Played On about it. The weather was reasonably kind, and everyone felt they were part of something special. Paul Flower (fan): I’m pretty sure it was the first time I saw Judas Priest, who I was pretty unsure about, but the motorbike on stage made an impression: at least they were trying something a little different. It didn’t feel like anyone had put any extra effort in. Neal Kay: I’ve got a picture of Rob and the crew bringing his Harley out of its flight case. You know, he couldn’t ride it. He never had a licence. Allan Jones: I didn’t really enjoy any of the music that day. The Scorpions were OK, and Judas Priest were amusing. Rob Halford rode a motorbike on stage, which for comic purposes I was hoping would go over the edge. But he stopped it in time. Andy Copping: As the night drew in, the bonfires started. It was like something out of Game of Thrones. Graham Bonnet: One person had told me there would be around 8,000 people there and when I walked out, I thought, “Oh my God, that’s more than 8,000 people.” I couldn’t believe how many people were there – all their lighters lighting up. And I thought, “Somewhere out there are my mum and dad.” My whole bloody family was out there. There was light coming from the stage into the first few rows. You see them. It’s like you’re playing in a rock club. Then you hear the rest of the audience, and it was like a jet plane coming in. It’s fucking amazing. Andy Copping: There was no question I preferred the Ronnie James Dio era of Rainbow, but I was obsessed with [guitarist] Ritchie Blackmore and you would sometimes see great shows, and sometimes see poor shows, in comparison. I would put the Donington performance somewhere in the middle. I don’t think it helped, the way Graham Bonnet was dressed [in a white suit jacket, red shirt and red trousers]. Not that that should have any effect, but as a teenager, when you’re seeing denim and leather and studs and long hair, and Graham Bonnet comes out dressed like he did, it was odd. Biff Byford: I wasn’t very fucking enamoured of their song choice, but that’s Ritchie Blackmore. I like Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?, but it’s nothing I would play at a rock festival. Andy Copping: There were a couple of songs – Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow? – that had me thinking: “You’re headlining! You should be banging out some really big tunes!” But that’s classic Ritchie Blackmore. He wants to cheese off an audience. Allan Jones: I don’t think Ritchie Blackmore playing Greensleeves through an 80,000-watt sound system much appealed to me. Dante Bonutto: When I met up with the guy from Melody Maker who was taking me home, he was so upset about the whole event and hated it so much, he took off his shoes and threw them out of the window of the car. He said, “I want no more of that mud anywhere near me.” He dropped me in the middle of nowhere. Allan Jones: I don’t remember us giving anybody a lift back. Jennie Halsall: When Allan Jones’s review came out [in Melody Maker], I just about wet my knickers. It was just about the most hysterical thing I’d ever read in my life as a PR. He got the whole day and smashed it. And the [Rainbow] manager made me read it to him on the phone. Allan Jones: I’ve had worse days than Castle Donington, just to be clear about it. Jennie Halsall: I heard a click on the extension and I figured it was Ritchie. I never found out if it was. But Bruce [Payne, Rainbow’s then manager] said, “Right, Jennie, come to the hotel. I’m going to Heathrow, you’re going to come with me.” And I was just screaming with laughter: “You’re going to fire me, aren’t you?” I got to the hotel, got in a cab, and halfway there, Bruce said: “You’re fired.” That was when my association with that client finished. Graham Bonnet: Monsters of Rock was the last time I saw Ritchie. Cozy left Donington, and Don Airey [keyboards, Rainbow] and I were staying at a hotel in Leicestershire. Cozy was meant to be in the same hotel but he got in his car and drove away. He sort of flitted away. Don said to me, “I don’t like it any more. Cozy’s gone and I can’t do without Cozy.” I said, “I feel the same way.” We tried till six in the morning begging him to stay, but he had work coming up he wanted to do more than Rainbow. We were saying: “Cozy, for Christ’s sake, man, we’re going to make another album.” Anyway, he was gone and it was very disappointing. So Don said he was going to leave the band. OK. I went back to LA. But he went back to the band. I didn’t go back to the band. Paul Loasby: We lost about 10 grand each, but it didn’t put me off. Steve Dawson: It weren’t, “This is a milestone that will be remembered for a long time.” I don’t think many people at the time realised it would become a regular thing, either. Biff Byford: We had no idea what a big deal it would turn out to be. Paul Loasby: And the classic car race on the Sunday – they decided to carry on. So a load of the campers and people who’d fallen asleep overnight stayed on, and they had a successful classic car race. The next year they did the same. Only by the third year of Monsters of Rock did they acknowledge it had become too big for them.

2/21/2022,"In the sample clues below, the links take you to explainers from our beginners series. The setter’s name often links to an interview with him or her, in case you feel like getting to know these people better.  Every so often, there is a puzzle so topical that someone shares it with their colossal following, enticing non-solvers to try our hobby. So it was with Vlad last week … Is the guardian cryptic crossword trying to tell us something? Hats off to Vlad! pic.twitter.com/dr3Pz5ptcj … in a, well, spirited reaction to events that prompted such clues as this one … 2d In a diary recalled work meeting one afternoon – this justifies conduct? (8)[definition: this justifies conduct?][wordplay: backwards (“recalled”) musical abbreviation for “work” inside (“in”) synonym for “a diary”, then Roman numeral for “one” + abbreviation for “afternoon”][OP, backwards, inside A LOG, then I + A] … for APOLOGIA. There was also this one … 6d Have confidence over investig­ator (female) – never good to show disloyalty (8)[definition: disloyalty][wordplay: synonym for “have confidence” + name of an investigator & slangy term for “female”, both without (“never”) abbreviation for “good”][BET + GRAY and GAL without both Gs] for BETRAYAL. Another puzzle that caught the eye of non-solvers was from Stephen McCarthy in the New York Times. The answers included various names from sci-fi. Four adjacent down clues were ambiguous: 71d “It’s a ____!” [WRAP or TRAP]67d Body part that precedes “band” [WAIST or WRIST]47d Ones involved in a transaction [PAYERS or PAYEES]55d Let out, in a way [LEASED or LEAKED] The answer crossing these – clued “The better of two major sci-fi film franchises?” – could equally validly be filled as STAR WARS or STAR TREK. Again, non-solvers have been sharing their wonderment and the good news is that this kind of ambiguity can be found in cryptics, such as Boatman’s referendum puzzle, the barred weekend challenges and beyond. Back in the day, we are told, Echo’s daughter tried to seduce Zeus. Hera, understandably, turned her into a bird. The bird began to appear on trinkets in old erotic magic and its name came to mean a charm, a spell – and a curse. The unlucky daughter lives on in a pleasingly brief clue from Carpathian in the quiptic, the Guardian’s stepping-stone puzzle “for beginners and those in a hurry”: 12a Juliet in kiss curse (4)[definition: curse][wordplay: letter represented by “Juliet” in Nato alphabet + IN (“in”) + letter denoting a kiss][J + IN + X] Echo’s daughter was Iynx; when I see a JINX as an answer, I keep in mind that the setter might have decided to include every letter of the alphabet, handily considering Qs and Zs when I go on to the later clues. Carpathian was also looking for QUIZ and BANK, so it paid off. An alternate spelling of the bird, jynx, features in one of the few 26-letter pangrams, “Veldt jynx grimps waqf zho buck”. Like almost all short pangrams, what it gains in brevity it loses in needing an explanation that it is in fact a meaningful sentence, unless you understand that it means “wryneck bird from the grasslands causes the mounting of hybrid cattle buck from land given to a religious institution for charitable purposes in Islamic countries”. When the paraphrase is barely more intelligible than the pangram, I stick with the quick brown fox, but I do like the feel of one of the words, the admittedly obscure subject of our next challenge. Reader, how would you clue GRIMP?

2/21/2022,"There’s a lot more to Amy Poehler than her role as deputy director (and future POTUS) Leslie Knope in 2009–2015’s Parks and Recreation (a character that was especially created for the Saturday Night Live comedian by the creators of the American Office). After graduating from university in 1991, Poehler joined a travelling improv group with 30 Rock’s Tina Fey, who, in 2001, went on to recruit Poehler for SNL where she performs as Hillary Clinton, Sharon Osbourne, Britney Spears, Madonna and many others. Poehler was nominated for nine Emmys, three Golden Globes and three Screen Actors Guild awards for her role in Parks and Recreation, eventually winning a Golden Globe for best actress in 2013.  Poehler features in 1999’s Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo (as Deuce’s client with Tourette syndrome), in Tina Fey’s 2004 Mean Girls (as Rachel McAdams’ reckless mother), and provides voices for Snow White in 2007’s Shrek the Third and lead character, Joy, in Pixar’s 2015 Inside Out. Poehler also stars opposite Arrested Development’s Will Arnett as Gob’s forgotten wife and in 2007’s Blades of Glory as Arnett’s character’s sister. Poehler and Arnett married in 2003 and had two sons but divorced in 2012 (a break-up that, earlier this month, Arnett told the Guardian had left him “crying for an hour at the side of the road.”) So, erm, let’s be delicate about that, perhaps. In 2019, Poehler directed her first film, Wine Country, in which she reunites with Tiny Fey, reviewed by the Guardian as a four star “wine-soaked gem”. And anything wine-soaked sounds good to us. Now she’s back in the director’s chair with a new documentary – Lucy and Desi, the tale of I Love Lucy’s Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz – that was very well received at this year’s Sundance film festival.

2/21/2022,"Central European countries on Ukraine’s western border are making preparations for a potential influx of millions of refugees in the event of a major Russian invasion of Ukraine. Poland in particular is bracing for various scenarios if Moscow invades Ukraine, according to its deputy interior minister, Maciej Wąsik. “We have to be prepared for a wave of up to a million people,” he told Polish radio.  Poland is already home to about 2 million Ukrainians, many of whom have moved since the 2014 conflict and taken advantage of a relatively easy scheme to gain work permits. The government has said it is planning to house Ukrainian refugees in hostels, dormitories and sports facilities. Last Saturday, Krzysztof Kosiński, the mayor of Ciechanów, a town in north-central Poland, said on Twitter he had been asked by authorities to indicate “the list of accommodation facilities for refugees, the number of people it would be possible to accommodate, the costs involved and the time for adaptation of buildings with a recommendation of up to 48 hours”. It is hard to say how many Ukrainians would flee a potential conflict. Many people from the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine have already left for other parts of the country or for Russia, while others have left the country in search of better-paid work. “Because we now have visa-free travel with Europe, people who wanted to leave have already done so,” said Ukraine’s finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, in an interview in Kyiv. “If Russia escalates and people decide to go to Europe to find a safer place, it’s likely to be a smaller portion of people,” he said. However, there are many different scenarios of how a Russian invasion may unfold, and if the warnings from US and British intelligence of a fully fledged invasion and drive to Kyiv by the Russians come to pass, it seems unlikely to be without huge casualties and displacements. “We are following the situation very closely; however, the situation remains unpredictable,” said Natalia Prokopchuk, a communications and advocacy officer for UNHCR in Europe. “In the meantime, the UN and its humanitarian partners in Ukraine hope that the ongoing tensions will not escalate and will be resolved through diplomatic and political means among all concerned parties,” she said. Other countries in eastern Europe are preparing for a potential influx of refugees if Russia attacks Ukraine. Romania’s interior minister, Lucian Bode, told TV B1 its government was considering the prospect of “hundreds of thousands of refugees in an uncontrolled influx”. “We are currently analysing how many refugee camps we can install in a relatively short time: 10, 12, 24 hours. We are analysing existing lodging capacities in border counties but we are also discussing the second stage, with neighbouring counties, and the third stage across the country,” he said. Slovakia’s interior minister, Roman Mikulec, said his government also stood ready to play a part. Rights groups have welcomed countries’ willingness to help, but some drew comparisons with the treatment of other refugees, in a part of Europe where politicians have often played on anti-refugee sentiment. After the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, organised the movement of refugees with the promise of a safe passage to Europe last year, thousands of people were caught by Polish border guards in the forests near the border and illegally and violently pushed back to Belarus. Late in January, Warsaw announced it has started building a €353m (£293m) wall along its frontier with Belarus, aimed at preventing Syrian and Iraqi asylum seekers from entering the country. A spokesperson for the Ocalenie Foundation, which supports refugees living in Poland, commended the commitment, but said it showed a double standard. “We wonder why they didn’t do any moves like that during the crisis on the border. This shows a general trend that in Poland some asylum seekers are favoured over others,” said the spokesperson. Wąsik described Ukrainians as “real refugees” in need of help and added that his government “absolutely won’t say no to helping them, in line with the Geneva conventions”. Grupa Granica, a Polish network of NGOs monitoring the situation on the border with Belarus, said in a statement: “For almost half a year the same government has violently pushed back people from many other countries trying to cross through Belarusian border. It is racist to differentiate people and their access to basic migration procedures based on the country of their origin. Why don’t they have access to the same treatment?” In the meantime, authorities in the self-declared Luhansk and Donetsk people’s republics have ordered an evacuation ostensibly to protect citizens from a planned Ukrainian attack, although there is no evidence Kyiv is planning any such thing. According to observers, the move appears designed to create a pretext to launch a Russian intervention.",News/World news,Ukraine’s neighbours bracing for millions of refugees if Russia invades,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/ukraines-neighbours-bracing-for-millions-of-refugees-if-russia-invades
2/21/2022,"Good morning. Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitri Peskov, has said it is “premature” to talk about specific plans for a summit between Putin and Joe Biden, after an announcement on Sunday from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, thathis Russian and US counterparts had agreed in principle to attend talks aimed at de-escalating the Ukraine crisis.  The Élysée Palace had put out a statement after last-minute diplomatic efforts by Macron to try to dissuade Russia from invading Ukraine amid further US warnings that war was imminent. The White House has confirmed Biden’s readiness to hold a summit but made clear it was wary about the sincerity of the offer. What did Peskov say? He said Putin and Biden could meet if they considered it necessary, but emphasised that it was “premature to talk about specific plans for a summit” and no concrete plans were in place. Is the threat of a Russian attack still predicted? Yes. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said: “Everything we are seeing suggests that this is dead serious, that we are on the brink of an invasion.” A massive leak from one of the world’s biggest private banks has exposed the hidden wealth of clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes. Details of accounts linked to 30,000 Credit Suisse clients are contained in the leak, which unmasks the beneficiaries of more than 100bn Swiss francs (£80bn) held in one of Switzerland’s best-known financial institutions. The leak points to widespread failures of due diligence by the bank, despite repeated pledges over decades to weed out dubious clients and illicit funds. The Guardian is part of a consortium of media outlets that has been given exclusive access to the data. My colleagues can reveal how Credit Suisse have repeatedly opened or maintained bank accounts for a panoramic array of high-risk clients across the world. What has the bank said about the revelations? “Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices,” it said in a statement. Last September, Donald Trump released a statement through his Save America website. “It is my great honor to endorse a true warrior,” he said, “a patriot who has fought for our country, who was willing to say what few others had the courage to say, who has my Complete and Total Endorsement.” Former US presidents usually reserve their most gushing praise – replete with Capital Letters – for global allies or people they are promoting for high office, writes Ed Pilkington. A candidate for the US Senate, perhaps, or someone vying to become governor of one of the biggest states. Trump by contrast was heaping plaudits on an individual running for an elected post that a year ago most people had never heard of, let alone cared about, endorsing a bid by Mark Finchem, a Republican lawmaker from Tucson, to become Arizona’s secretary of state. Why should this be so worrying? The post holder is the chief election officer, with powers to certify election results, vet the legal status of candidates and approve infrastructure such as voting machines. In short, they are in charge of conducting and counting the vote. Meanwhile, Trump’s new social media venture, Truth Social, has launched on Apple’s App Store. Read about that here. Republicans in several states have launched efforts to ban books pertaining to race and LGBTQ+ issues from classrooms while some legislatures are pushing to introduce laws that would ban teachers from discussing homosexuality. But it’s a crackdown that few parents have asked for. US immigration courts are struggling to function at the most basic level, with judges who are already woefully understaffed and often undertrained now overwhelmed by a growing backlog of more than 1.6m cases, industry leaders have warned. The three-week occupation over Covid rules and the Trudeau government ends with 76 vehicles towed and 191 arrests. Canadian police secured the downtown core of Ottawa with fencing on Sunday, as city workers cleaned up trash and snow plows cleared streets after two days of tense standoffs. When is a classical music composition not actually classical? This is the conundrum at the heart of a heated row over the shortlisted songs for the Grammys, the annual awards that will be handed out in a few weeks’ time to recognise outstanding contributions to music. What started as a useful tip on social media has turned the US psychologist and mum of three into a parenting phenomenon and the voice of reason for a generation of young mums and dads. In terms of translating deep ideas into social media nuggets for time-starved parents to consume in spare moments, Dr Becky Kennedy seems to have aced the market. But is it possible to come away with meaningful change from such short snippets? A desire to return to the ocean goes back millennia, with evidence of sea burials in ancient Egypt and Rome. Today, the idea of an ocean burial chimes with a search for eco-friendly alternatives to traditional burial and cremation. While the reef model still requires cremation, the idea is that the structures will help restore marine habitats by mimicking some characteristics of a coral reef. But do underwater cremation memorials help people regenerate marine habitats in death or are they a “greenwashing” gimmick? The men’s 50km mass start skiing race at the Beijing Games was shortened to 30km but that did little to help Finland’s Remi Lindholm, who needed a heat pack at the end of the race to thaw out a particularly sensitive body part. Lindholm spent just under an hour and 16 minutes traversing the course in howling, freezing winds, leading to his penis becoming frozen for the second time in a cross-country skiing race, after a similar incident in Ruka, Finland last year.

There were more than 150 flood warnings in place across the north of England, as well as severe flooding in parts of Northern Ireland. More than 400 households in south Manchester were urged to evacuate, the Environment Agency said.  Storm Franklin comes just days after Storm Eunice killed at least four people in the UK and Ireland and left 1.4 million homes without power.

2/21/2022,"“If you cook in a bad mood, the bad mood will season your food.” Now, had this been uttered by anyone else, I might have been interested in having a discussion about that statement – philosophical, scientific or silly. But irrational loathing got in the way and I wanted to kick her. We were standing in the kitchen of a mutual friend, and trying to manage plates of food, forks and glasses. I remember little about the conversation, which was between a few of us, except for this statement made to me, which she followed up by telling us that, even on the worst of days, she cooked only with love and passion. Kicking her would have been the grown-up thing to do, rather than trying to come up with a reply, which didn’t actually come to mind until the next day. But even if it had turned up, it would have been too late: she had already mingled on and was leaning against the fridge patronising someone else.  In her book The Faraway Nearby, Rebecca Solnit quotes the philosopher Charles Griswold, who says, “Resentment is a storytelling passion.” Solnit observes how compelling resentment stories are. Like a camel harnessed to a rotary water pump, we go round and round, reviving feelings with every retelling; and how, each time we tell a story, it gets better, enriched with details, remembered or made up. This is absolutely the case here. Something that happened 20 years ago is more alive than ever. Especially when I am in a bad mood and cooking – a regular occurrence in everyday life. As I chop onions aggressively, or rip the bag of dried mushrooms badly, so it doesn’t open. As I rip it for the second time, so they fall out, there she is in her silk shirt the colour of my loathing, leaning against the fridge. Cook with love, she says, as I soak 20g dried mushrooms in 200ml warm water for 30 minutes. Piss off, I reply as I lift them out, chop and set aside. Of course, you don’t have to be in a bad mood to make this recipe – a bit cross, tired or grumpy is fine; quite-a-good-mood is OK, too. I would, however, avoid making it if you are feeling particularly happy. Like most stews, ragùs and braises (and resentment), this dish benefits from a rest, so the flavours can settle and deepen. It is delicious with rice or boiled potatoes. It is best of all, however, with pasta, especially long egg pasta – tagliatelle, fettuccine or pappardelle. For four, cook 450g dried or 600g fresh long pasta in well-salted water until al dente. Ladle a couple of scoops of the lentils into the bottom of a large, warm bowl. Lift the pasta on top, sprinkle over a handful of parmesan, then add a few more spoonfuls of lentils and toss well, adding a little pasta cooking water and tossing again if it seems stiff. Share between bowls and serve with more grated parmesan. Taste and tell the woman she is wrong: lentil and mushroom ragù cooked in a bad mood is the most delicious thing in the world.

Once soaked, lift the mushrooms out, chop and set aside. Filter the soaking liquid and add enough light stock or water to make it up to 1.2 litres. In deep saute pan or casserole set over a medium-low heat, fry the onion, celery and carrot with a pinch of salt and a bay leaf in the olive oil until soft and translucent. Add both the fresh and soaked mushrooms and the thyme and cook, stirring, for a few minutes. Add the lentils, stir, then add the wine, tomato puree and diluted porcini liquid. Bring to a boil, then turn down to a lively simmer for 40 minutes, stirring often, until the lentils are tender and the consistency rich. If at any point during the cooking the mix seems dry, add a little more wine or water. Taste and check for salt and add a few grinds of black pepper.

2/21/2022,"In January 2016, Nick’s mother died. He had only been living in Bristol for six months when it happened. “It was difficult because I didn’t know many people,” he says. A week later, his girlfriend dumped him by text. “It was a really bad time. I’d relocated from my home town of Wrexham to be a theatre operations manager, but I was lonely,” he says. He decided to cheer himself up with a trip to France to watch Euro 2016, so, that summer, he travelled to Bordeaux with a friend. “We weren’t able to get tickets, but the city had set up massive fan zones with huge screens for watching the games,” he says. “We were supporting Wales in their game against Slovakia.” All around, there were promotional stands giving out free merchandise. That’s when Nick spotted Tess, a French student who was working as a host at the event.  “She was giving out free footballs, and I thought she was really beautiful,” he says. Tess thought Nick was “cute”, too. “He tried to convince me to give him a football, but I couldn’t because we had a limited supply and children were prioritised.” She told him to come back at the end of the day to see if she had any left. “At that point, I stuffed one under my seat so there would be one left,” she says. When Nick returned, he asked if she’d like to go for dinner before he returned to the UK. “I said yes, but wasn’t expecting him to remember,” says Tess. Like many other supporters, he’d had a few drinks. “I had a good excuse because Wales had just won their first tournament game in 58 years,” he says. They exchanged Facebook details and agreed to meet at a traditional French restaurant the next day. “We spoke about everything, starting with typical date questions, then moving on to politics – Justin Bieber came up at one point but I can’t remember why!” says Tess. The conversation flowed easily, but there was no kiss at the end of the night. “I was a bit confused and wondered if he just wanted to talk,” she admits. The following day, they met for coffee before Nick travelled home, but there was still no kiss. “I was disappointed because I liked him and he was leaving,” says Tess. As she lived near the airport, she decided to give things one last try. “There was only one flight a day to Bristol, so I went to see if I could catch him before he got on the plane,” she says. Just as she was about to give up and go home, she spotted Nick. “I was checking in for my flight and thinking about the amazing time I’d had,” he says. “It was the first time I’d felt truly happy in months. When I saw Tess, I was blown away. It’s one of the best things that has ever happened.” They shared their first kiss at the airport and agreed to meet up again. Over the next few weeks, Nick made two more trips to Bordeaux. By September, they had agreed to give their long-distance relationship a shot. In 2017, Tess moved to London with a friend, so she and Nick were able to see each other more regularly. The following year, they began making plans to move in together. “We decided to move to Liverpool, as it’s cheaper than London, and closer to Nick’s family,” says Tess. “I was working for Pret a Manger and they were able to transfer my job.” Nick joined her, six months later, in early 2019. He now works for the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Hall. That year, Tess proposed on a trip to Edinburgh. “It was meant to be at the castle but the wind was so strong he wouldn’t have been able to hear me,” says Tess. “The restaurant was noisy, too, so in the end I proposed while watching TV at our B&B.” Their wedding was delayed due to Covid, but they plan to marry in Bordeaux this May. “The thing I love most about Tess is her positivity,” says Nick. “She always has a great outlook on life and it’s really infectious.” Tess appreciates his respectful nature. “From the start, we could have a mature conversation about so many different things. He is so interesting and has so much knowledge. There’s nothing we can’t talk about.” Want to share your story?

2/21/2022,"In 2011, as popular revolts reverberated around the Middle East, a monarch in the midst of it all made some banking decisions. Sometime that year, as neighbouring Egypt and Syria withered in the face of momentous civil protests, King Abdullah II of Jordan opened two new accounts with Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank that had discreetly served the region’s well-heeled for decades. Abdullah, one of the world’s longest-serving current monarchs, had chosen a banker that shared his approach to secrecy, particularly surrounding his personal wealth. Over the next five years, the king was the beneficial owner of at least six accounts with Credit Suisse, while his wife, Queen Rania, had another.  According to a massive trove of data leaked from the bank that names both royals as account holders, one account would later be worth a remarkable 230m Swiss francs (£180m). At home, King Abdullah had been experiencing a rocky ride. The revolts, which came to be known as the Arab spring, led to leaders being toppled in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen, and a brutal, protracted war breaking out in Syria. Jordan, one of the region’s more efficient security states, was able to stave off a threat from a nascent opposition, through suppression of dissent and promises of better days. But in the decade since, a struggling economy, persistent levels of poverty, high unemployment, cuts to welfare and seemingly ever-present austerity measures have continued to stir resentment across the country. One particular gripe has been the juxtaposition between the apparent wealth of the king and the constant grind endured by most citizens just to get by. As the IMF agreed to bail out Jordan, on the condition that its people tighten their collective belts, the king was moving enormous amounts between his Swiss accounts. The Credit Suisse data contains details of 18,000 bank accounts leaked to Süddeutsche Zeitung by a whistleblower who said Swiss banking secrecy laws were “immoral”. The data was shared with the Guardian and 47 other media outlets as part of a global investigation called Suisse secrets. What is the Suisse secrets leak? Suisse secrets is a global journalistic investigation into a leak of data from the Swiss bank Credit Suisse. It comprises more than 18,000 bank accounts that were leaked to Süddeutsche Zeitung by a whistleblower who said Swiss banking secrecy laws were ""immoral"". The data, which is only a partial capture of the bank’s 1.5 million private banking clients, is linked to more than 30,000 Credit Suisse clients. The leak includes personal, shared and corporate bank accounts – holding, on average, 7.5m Swiss francs (CHF). Almost 200 accounts in the data are worth more than 100m CHF, and more than a dozen are valued in the billions. While some accounts in the data were open as far back as the 1940s, more than two-thirds were opened since 2000. Many of those were still open well into the last decade, and a portion remain open today. The Guardian was among more than 48 media partners around the world including journalists at Le Monde, NDR, the Miami Herald and the New York Times. They spent months using the data to investigate the bank, in a project coordinated by Süddeutsche Zeitung and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). They unearthed evidence Credit Suisse accounts had been used by clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes, suggesting widespread failures of due diligence by the bank. It is not illegal to have a Swiss account and the leak also contained data of legitimate clients who had done nothing wrong. In its response, Credit Suisse said it ""strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices"". Lawyers for King Abdullah and Queen Rania said there had been no wrongdoing by the clients, and gave an account of the source of their funds, which they said were compliant with applicable tax law. King Abdullah is not required to pay taxes in Jordan, where the monarch is exempt by law. His lawyers said a large proportion of the funds in the Swiss bank derived from inheritance from his father, King Hussein, and there are no inheritance tax laws in Jordan. The revelations come at an uncomfortable time for King Abdullah and his family, surfacing six months after the monarch featured prominently in the leak of the biggest ever trove of offshore data, the Pandora papers, which revealed he had acquired a $100m luxury property portfolio stretching from Malibu in California to Belgravia in central London. Details of more offshore accounts will add to allegations that Jordan’s king of 22 years lives a life disconnected from the demanding realities faced by most of its citizens, who live by a different set of rules. After publication of the Pandora papers, Jordanian intelligence moved quickly to block online access to stories detailing the revelations about the king’s wealth. The handful of journalists who defied the ban were questioned. Some were reminded of “patriotic duties” to Jordan. Others felt intimidated into silence. The Jordanian publication that did run the revelations received a call from intelligence asking for the story to be taken down. The king’s lawyers said accusations of media repression in Jordan after the publication of the Pandora papers were “denied”. They declined to elaborate. Two years before the Pandora revelations, Jordanian security forces arrived at the home of Moayyad al-Majali detaining the lawyer then accusing him of one of the kingdom’s most serious offences. His purported offence was slandering King Abdullah, simply by asking how much land the king owned. Holding an offshore bank account is not illegal and there is no suggestion that King Abdullah has broken laws by structuring wealth offshore. Neither is there any suggestion of wrongdoing or due diligence failings by Credit Suisse. However, the revelations will raise renewed questions about the source of the fortune at Abdullah’s disposal in a country supported annually by billions of dollars in foreign aid. They will also spur questions about whether the king may have been seeking safe havens for family wealth as his country’s woes deepened. On the home front, in recent years protests about deteriorating conditions have led to ongoing political chaos, with a series of prime ministers removed from office and governments remaining weak and dependent on foreign support. Even some Jordanian tribes, which have offered bedrock support for Abdullah, and from which most of the country’s establishment figures hail, have shown their frustration at a state struggling to service its own. In March last year, the king’s hold on the country was briefly threatened when his half-brother, Prince Hamzah, whom he had ousted as heir 17 years earlier, was detained and two aides convicted of sedition after the apparent early stages of a plot against the throne were uncovered. Hamzah’s supporters have described the events as a “mutiny” that had popular support. However, Jordanian intelligence and some senior officials believe it instead stemmed from a belated push by Trump officials and the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to install a monarch who would have endorsed the failed attempt to etch peace between Israel and the Palestinians, labelled the “deal of the century”. Through his lawyers, King Abdullah said only one of the Credit Suisse accounts remained open. They said they comprised personal investment companies (PICs) set up as vehicles for trust funds to provide for the royal couple’s children. They said one of the accounts held proceeds from the sale of a “large wide body aircraft”, while another smaller jet was bought. The king is known to use at least two private jets. His lawyers said “a significant percentage” of his personal wealth was used to fund royal initiatives in a personal capacity to target social and economic needs of Jordanian citizens, as well as the restoration of important mosques. They declined to say what percentage. In the Jordanian capital, Amman, anger at the king and his government has been unusually strident during recent protests against unemployment levels and a stagnant economy. At some rallies, demonstrators have hit effigies of Abdullah with shoes – considered a stark indignity across the Arab world. However, the Hashemite dynasty that Abdullah leads does not appear under serious threat, for now. Daoud Kuttab, the director general of the Amman-based Community Media Network, predicted the disclosures would anger some Jordanians, particularly unemployed youth. “The king and the government will face some protests and demonstrations but will most likely manage this as they have previous revelations – but it will be difficult.” Additional reporting by David Pegg.

2/21/2022,"Russia has suggested that talk of a summit between Vladimir Putin and the US president, Joe Biden, is premature, saying the two leaders could arrange a call or meeting at any time but there were no concrete plans for an imminent high-level encounter. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Monday tensions over Ukraine were rising but diplomatic contacts remained active, adding that the Russian president would soon address a special session of Russia’s security council.  The comments came after the Élysée Palace announced that Biden and Putin had agreed in principle to a summit aimed at de-escalating the crisis after two calls between the Russian leader and French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Sunday. Peskov said Putin and Macron held a second call at about 1am on Monday in which the leaders “emphasised the need to continue dialogue between foreign ministries and political advisers” on the Ukraine situation. “Contacts between Russia and France at foreign minister level are also possible in the near future,” he added. He said Putin and Biden could meet if they felt it necessary, but stressed it was “premature to talk about specific plans” for a summit. “The meeting is possible if the leaders consider it feasible,” Peskov said after a flurry of last-ditch diplomacy by Macron over the weekend in which he spoke to Putin, Biden, Boris Johnson and the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Peskov said US media reports that Russia had drawn up a list of Ukrainians to capture or kill after an invasion were an “absolute lie” and described as “highly unusual” a warning from the US embassy to Americans in Russia that they should prepare plans to leave the country if necessary. Ukraine’s foreign minister on Monday welcomed the French summit proposal, saying Kyiv hoped it would result in Moscow pulling back its estimated 150,000 troops massed along the border, averting a Russian invasion that US and other officials have said could begin at any moment. “We welcome this initiative. We believe that every effort aimed at a diplomatic solution is worth trying,” Dmytro Kuleba said in Brussels before a meeting with his EU counterparts. “We hope the two presidents will walk out from the room with an agreement about Russia withdrawing its forces from Ukraine.” Kuleba also called for the EU to start imposing sanctions on Russia “now” to deter Putin from attacking. “We believe that there are good reasons … to impose at least some of the sanctions now to demonstrate that the EU is not only talking the talk about sanctions, but also walking the walk,” he said. France’s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, who was also in Brussels on Monday morning, said he would hold talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, later in the day, while the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will call Putin later in the day, the Russian state news agency Ria-Novosti reported. Macron’s office said on Sunday that in parallel with talks to secure a ceasefire on the ground in the enclave in eastern Ukraine held by Moscow-backed separatists, the president had proposed the Putin-Biden summit and both were open to the idea. The summit would go ahead, however, only “on the condition that Russia does not invade Ukraine”, the Élysée said. France’s minister for European affairs, Clément Beaune, said on Monday there was still hope for a diplomatic resolution. “If there is still a chance to avoid war, to avoid a confrontation and build a political and diplomatic solution, then we need to take it,” Beaune told French television. US administration officials in Washington, however, expressed scepticism. “Timing to be determined. Format to be determined. So it’s all completely notional,” one official told Agence-France Presse. The White House has confirmed Biden’s readiness to hold a summit providing no invasion had taken place, but made clear it was wary. “We are always ready for diplomacy. We are also ready to impose swift and severe consequences should Russia instead choose war,” the White House spokesperson, Jen Psaki, said on Sunday night. “And currently, Russia appears to be continuing preparations for a full-scale assault on Ukraine very soon,” she added. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, said on Monday there was no sign of Russian forces withdrawing from the border, and that Moscow-backed rebels continue to shell Ukrainian positions. “Since the beginning of this day, as of 9am, 14 attacks have already been recorded, 13 of them from weapons prohibited by the Minsk agreements,” he told reporters in Kyiv. “One of our soldiers was wounded. It’s a war crime. They want to provoke us so Russia has a pretext.” Reznikov said his troops had been given strict instructions not to fire back. He dismissed Kremlin claims that Kyiv was preparing an offensive to retake separatist territories in the east of the country as “fake”. “Of course Russia can start an attack. I’m sure they have a plan like that. The Ukrainian military is ready to resist any scenario. We keep vigil,” he said at a press conference in Kyiv. A US satellite imagery company, Maxar Images, said its analysis showed “multiple new field deployments of [Russian] armoured equipment and troops” departing from existing military sites into forests and fields about nine to 19 miles from Russia’s border with Ukraine. The new photos, taken on Sunday, appeared to show vehicle tracks cutting through snow-covered fields that are surrounded by woodland and bordered by roads, with several buildings also visible, indicating troop and equipment movement near three locations in southwestern Russia, Maxar said.",News/World news,"‘Premature’ to talk of specific plan for a Putin-Biden summit on Ukraine, says Kremlin",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/premature-to-talk-of-specific-plan-for-a-putin-biden-summit-on-ukraine-says-russia
2/21/2022,"Key members of the Church of England’s pensions board have strong links to the fossil fuel industry, research has shown, amid concerns over the organisation’s plans to end its investments in high-carbon companies. Analysis by DeSmog, the environmental investigation group, has found three prominent members of the pensions board of the Church Commissioners, the body that looks after Church of England investments, with former or current roles in energy companies, while other major figures have indirect links.  The Church of England began to cut ties to coal and other heavily polluting industries in 2015, then pledged in 2018 to divest by 2023 from high-carbon companies that were “not aligned with the goals of the Paris agreement”. But as the deadline approaches, the organisation has said it is still “engaging” with key oil and gas interests rather than cancelling all of its holdings. Chris Manktelow, of the Young Christians Climate Network, said this was not good enough. “I understand why the church wants to engage, but I don’t think the strategy of engagement is working,” he told the Guardian. “The church should be moving quickly and showing moral leadership, and is just not going fast enough. We are not happy with this response [to the calls to divest].” There are also questions over the church’s approach to oil and gas companies that claim they are on a trajectory to net zero emissions. Some fossil fuel companies – including BP, Shell and ExxonMobil – have set out strategies to reach net zero, but many experts regard these plans as flawed. ExxonMobil, for example, is only planning to reduce the emissions from its operations, rather than those that arise from burning the oil and gas it produces. However, the Church Commissioners decided recently to retain investment in ExxonMobil. Manktelow said: “We think the church should reconsider this decision.” Manktelow said he was also “surprised and concerned” by the links between senior figures in deciding the church’s investments and the fossil fuel industry. Chris Mather, the chair of the Church of England pensions board, is a former chief executive of Shell Canada, from which he retired in 2007. During his tenure, the company embarked on a massive expansion into “tar sands”, which campaigners say has laid waste to vast tracts of Canada’s wilderness. Richard Hubbard, the chair of the board’s pensions committee, worked for BP for nearly 30 years, ending as director of the oil giant’s European cross-border pension plan before retiring in 2020. David Nussbaum, on the Church of England’s ethical investment advisory group, and a former chief of the conservation group WWF, has held a directorship at Drax since 2017. Drax is formerly the UK’s biggest coal-fired power plant and still the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions, having switched its boilers to burning trees. Others with indirect links include Alan Smith, the first church estates commissioner, a former head of risk strategy at HSBC, the bank which has financed more than $100bn (£73bn) in fossil fuels since the 2015 Paris agreement; and Dami Lalude, also a member of the ethical investment advisory group, who worked in the natural resources group at the bank Goldman Sachs, which has also provided $100bn to fossil fuel interests since 2015. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, also has a background in the fossil fuel industry, having worked for oil companies for more than a decade before ordination. Darrell Hannah, the rector of All Saints Church, Ascot, and chair of the Christian climate change charity Operation Noah, told DeSmog he feared the decision-making bodies could be compromised. “We are deeply concerned by the Church of England national investing bodies’ ties to the fossil fuel industry, which raise significant questions around conflicts of interest,” he said. “How can the board continue to lead engagement with Shell, on behalf of Climate Action 100+ [an investor-led initiative to push big companies to do more on the climate crisis], when the chair of the pensions board is the former CEO of Shell Canada?” The Church Commissioners, the body that looks after the investments that pay Church of England pensioners, said the policy of engagement was paying off. “The Church of England’s national investing bodies have taken the view that they have more influence on high-carbon industries by being in the room rather than by disinvesting,” a spokesperson told the Guardian. “By engaging with high-carbon-emitting companies, we can address the climate crisis and bring about real world change. Our engagement is not open-ended and we are explicit in our expectation that we will disinvest from companies that are not responsive to engagement.” The spokesperson added: “It is not a surprise that we want experts from industry and finance on our governance bodies to help us make the right decisions. Our board members and their backgrounds are disclosed and readily available online. They operate to the highest ethical and responsible investing standards. They sit alongside other board members from a variety of backgrounds, including church and other third-sector experience. By calling out these individuals incorrectly suggests that the church’s decisions are somehow influenced by those associations.” The strategy was making “significant progress”, as 20 companies had agreed to “making climate-related changes to stay off our restricted list” since 2020, and a further 28 companies were excluded from its investment list on ethical grounds last year. “We want to achieve a net-zero world, not only a net-zero investment portfolio.”",News/Environment,Concern over Church of England pension board fossil fuel industry links,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/21/concern-over-church-of-england-pension-board-fossil-fuel-industry-links
2/21/2022,"The Owl and the Nightingale may have been written 800 years ago, but its anonymous author shows that human nature nearly never changes: two rivals’ joust in the tree tops using words as lances to try to wound the other. However, proving the exception to the rule, two men from the West Yorkshire village of Marsden – poet laureate Simon Armitage and his lifelong friend, the theatre director John Tiffany – are collaborating on a performance of the medieval poem that Armitage translated last year.  Armitage’s translation from the Middle English original was the fourth of the medieval poems he has rewritten for modern audiences and he suspects it will be the last. Part of the reason is that there simply isn’t anything else as much fun. The Owl and the Nightingale could hardly be a greater contrast to Tiffany’s day job directing seven productions of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child in seven cities. He co-authored the play with JK Rowling and the playwright Jack Thorne and is soon to leave for Tokyo to supervise a Japanese language production. In contrast, the Owl and the Nightingale will be performed on a bare stage at the Royal Court theatre in London and the only props will be copies of the script. Armitage will narrate and the parts of the Owl and the Nightingale will be read by Meera Syal and Maxine Peake. A day has been set aside for the rehearsal. In a testament to the skill of his actors, Tiffany was happy to temporarily leave seven Harry Potters and hundreds of cast members in the hands of others so he could work on a show with just three performers. The cantankerous Owl and the disputatious Nightingale are each convinced they are right and are impervious to persuasion. Their discussion is so reminiscent of confrontations on social media the publisher was happy to bill Armitage’s translation as a “Twitter spat”. In the world of entertainment, Armitage is a the sombre Owl and Tiffany the lighter-than-champagne-bubbles Nightingale. Tiffany is a few years younger than 58-year-old Armitage and doesn’t let him forget it. Their fathers, who died recently within six months of each other, were best friends their entire lives as well as being members of the same amateur dramatic society and brass band. Their grandmothers played whist in the village hall, bragging about the achievements of their precocious grandsons between hands. Tiffany said: “They were much more competitive than the two of us. Simon’s career took off way before mine did. There’d be newspaper articles saying he’s being considered for poet laureate and I’d be assistant director on a play in Edinburgh and I always used to say: ‘Please Grandma, I’m incredibly moved and flattered but I don’t think we are going to win this particular battle,’ but they continued which me and Simon loved. “With him being poet laureate, I was ‘look at you being all posh’. I always like to point out that we weren’t actually friends as children because I’m much younger than him. I’m not actually that much younger but I do like to point it out.” Tiffany sees the avian rivals as two divas, think Hilda Ogden and Rita Fairclough from Coronation Street. Armitage did not have to labour the parallels. He said: “I don’t think it’s a didactic piece, I haven’t translated it because it’s got a moral lesson for our age, but I definitely see reflections and echoes of our times and I don’t think they need to be amplified too far to be clear. These are two birds having a barney over 900 rhyming couplets.” He added: “The most obvious parallel or comparison is that we live in a very divided, very antagonistic time. What’s interesting to me about these two birds is that both of them absolutely believe they are right. It fully attunes to the times we are living in, in terms of people having access to ways to broadcast their opinions so readily and so feistily. “The birds have their positions and they are unshakable. The way that they go about announcing their positions is not just to talk through the strength of their argument, it’s also to undermine and attack the arguments of the other. They do that in both in rational and logical ways and in scurrilous and vulgar ways as well.” Armitage says: “Being in a room with John, watching him work with actors, having him to tell me what to do, is just a lot of fun. We are the Marsden Boys and we are the hottest ticket in town.”",Arts/Books,Ode to a Twitter spat: Simon Armitage and John Tiffany’s bird play,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/17/ode-to-a-twitter-spat-simon-armitage-and-john-tiffany-play-the-owl-and-the-nightingale
2/21/2022,"The UK private sector is growing at its fastest pace since last summer as the easing of Covid-19 restrictions prompts increased spending on travel, leisure and entertainment. Stronger consumer spending is behind a pickup in service sector activity, according to the “flash” estimate of the state of the economy in February provided by IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips).  But the monthly health check also found growing inflationary pressures driven by higher wages, dearer energy and more expensive raw materials. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the combination of strong growth and a rising cost of living was likely to prompt a further increase in interest rates from the Bank of England next month. “The latest PMI surveys indicate a resurgent economy in February, as business activity leaped as Covid-19 containment measures were relaxed. “With the PMI’s gauge of output growth accelerating markedly in February and cost pressures intensifying to the second highest on record, the odds of an increasingly aggressive policy tightening have shortened, with a third back-to-back rate rise looking increasingly inevitable in March.” The monthly purchasing managers’ index from IHS Markit/Cips provides an early guide to how the private sector is performing each month. The release coincides with the lifting of all remaining Covid-19 restrictions in England. Activity in the service sector rose from 54.1 to 60.8 – the highest level since June, while manufacturing remained unchanged at 57.3. A reading above 50 suggests output is rising. The survey said private sector companies were reporting a steep increase in incoming new work in February, with higher workloads leading to a pickup in recruitment. “Stronger client demand was widely linked to improving confidence about the UK economic outlook and rollback of pandemic restrictions,” it said. Samuel Tombs, a UK economist at Pantheon Macro, said: “The sharp rise in the composite PMI in February, to its highest level since June, suggests that the UK economy is rebounding from Omicron at a fair clip. The PMI was well above its average level in the second half of 2021 – 56.3 – when GDP rose by 1.0% in both the third and fourth quarters.”",News/Business,UK business growth at highest since June as Covid restrictions ease,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/21/uk-business-growth-covid-restrictions-private-sector
2/21/2022,"During Covid lockdowns, Sharon Powell felt alone. She was caring for her father, 90, who was deteriorating from Parkinson’s disease and dementia, and looking after him had become increasingly difficult. Social life in her community in Johnson Fold, Bolton, had been Powell’s escape from the pressure at home, but when Covid restrictions were introduced “everything was just gone”. She was depressed, anxious and having panic attacks “like a washing machine on full spin”.  Doctors had prescribed Powell pills for a host of ailments, mental and physical – “that much medication I’m surprised I don’t sound like a set of maracas when I walk”, she said. “But … having suffered with mental illness for the past 30 years I knew that this had got beyond where medication could help. “Medication can only do so much when you’re stuck in four walls.” That was when a nurse at her local surgery put Powell in touch with Trisha Goddard, a social prescribing link worker at Bolton GP Federation. “Trisha mentioned about going on walks, and I was like, well, I love walking and if it’s a small group I don’t mind,” Powell said. She now credits Goddard’s suggestion with having helped saved her life. In response to a dramatic increase in mental health referrals around the pandemic, Bolton GP Federation and the Woodland Trust worked together to create a programme of “tranquility walks”, focusing on woodland, water and relaxation as a space to deal with anxiety. The group met at Barrow Bridge, a short walk from Powell’s home. Led by a Woodland Trust officer, they rambled through woodland on the Smithills estate, a site recently bought by the charity. It was a place Powell already knew and would visit to think. “But since doing the tranquility walks the thinking time has taken on a whole new meaning because I’m taking notice of the sounds, the smells,” she said. “The running water, because there’s a stream … and the birds’ song and the rustling of the leaves and the wind … it’s just nice to take time out. It’s lovely and it’s on my doorstep.” Vicky Entwistle, who works at the estate and led walks, said groups would stop to listen to branches and leaves swaying, or to watch dappled light through the canopy, an experience many found transformative. “It shows the importance of getting more nature to people’s doorsteps to help boost our health everyday, and the clear benefits of social prescribing with nature,” she said. Wildlife Trust is backing a petition to call on the government to enshrine in law a right to access to nature. The fortnightly Smithills tranquility walks have continued for a year now, and members of the group have formed strong bonds, Powell says. But she goes out more, when health permits it. She has become an advocate for open spaces, volunteering at Smithills – and sharing a newfound passion for mycology with her granddaughters. “I just forget everything when I’m out,” she said. “All my worries and stresses of home, stresses of family, and just lose track of time.”",News/Society,‘I forget everything’: the benefits of nature for mental health,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/21/i-forget-everything-the-benefits-of-nature-for-mental-health
2/21/2022,"The British aviation services company John Menzies has agreed a £550m takeover deal with a Kuwaiti rival, in a move that is likely to end a price negotiation after four separate bids. The Edinburgh-based company, which offers services ranging from cargo and baggage handling to passenger check-in and plane de-icing and refuelling, told the stock market on Monday that it would unanimously recommend a deal if National Aviation Services (NAS) confirms its bid of 608p a share.  Aviation services companies have been among the hardest hit during the coronavirus pandemic, as lockdown restrictions forced airlines to cut back flights for months. Outsourced services were especially vulnerable as airlines looked to cut costs as quickly as possible. The takeover would cap one of the more extraordinary corporate stories on the London Stock Exchange. Menzies was founded in 1833 in Edinburgh as a bookshop, with the eponymous founder eventually becoming the first Scottish agent of the author Charles Dickens and the magazine Punch. Newspaper distribution and a chain of newsagents and bookshops became an important part of the business and in 1948 Menzies opened its first outlet in an airport, before expanding into cargo handling in 1987. It sold its retail operation in 1998 and four years ago sold its newspaper business to focus on aviation services, shortly before the air industry suffered its greatest crisis. Menzies revealed the first two takeover approaches of 460p and 510p a share on 9 February. It described those initial unsolicited approaches as “highly opportunistic” because the valuation did not properly reflect the business’s worth before the pandemic. NAS had returned with an offer of 605p a share, which was also rejected by the Menzies board before it accepted the final 608p offer. However, Menzies shares traded short of that offer price on Monday morning, with shares gaining only 0.3% to hit 585p – although that was the highest level since September 2018. Menzies said: “NAS has confirmed to the board that the financial terms of the final proposal are final and will not be increased” unless another bidder steps in with a higher bid. Under stock market rules NAS has until 9 March to make a formal offer.",News/Business,John Menzies accepts new £550m takeover offer from Kuwaiti rival,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/21/john-menzies-takeover-offer-kuwaiti-national-aviation-services
2/21/2022,"Downright deceit, charm, wronged women determined to avenge, a raging storm … Mozart’s opera about the pathological liar and libertine could hardly seem more contemporary. When Welsh National Opera’s 2011 production was revived in 2018 – circa #MeToo – it appeared timely, but, with this latest revival, perhaps the reality is that it will always be so. Designer John Napier’s set, inspired by Auguste Rodin’s The Gates of Hell, creates the suitably tenebrous background to original director John Caird’s concept, underlining what is already the spoiler-alert of the title, Don Giovanni or The Dissolute Punished. The ironically whiter-than-white garb of the dashing don and the grey of his servant Leporello go against the setting’s general darkness, while the other costumes reflect the burnished colours of Spanish Golden Age. Yet, from the outset, Mozart and his librettist Lorenzo da Ponte’s mix of serious and the jocose has always meant that the audience is appalled and amused by turns. This is an infinitely delicate balance, so it was unfortunate that conductor Tobias Ringborg hurricaned his way through the overture, with the problem of raggedness never quite resolved for the rest of the evening.  In the title role, Ukrainian Andrei Kymach, the 2019 BBC Cardiff singer of the world, is an imposing and saturnine presence on stage, though the subtler colours of his baritone were too often lost early on: it was only in the second act that he projected much more potently the air of defiant arrogance and entitlement. As Leporello, Simon Bailey’s impeccable diction allowed the comedic element of the master/servant exchanges to come over strongly. The hapless Donna Elvira was sung by Sarah Tynan, as feisty as she could be given the ambivalence of Elvira’s fluctuation between love and hate for Don Giovanni. The outstanding singing came from Marina Monzó as Donna Anna, in an elegantly expressive and technically perfectly placed performance, anger and anguish at her father the Commendatore’s murder controlled without ever losing sight of Mozartean finesse. Her Don Ottavio, Trystan Llŷr Griffiths, made the most of his big arias, apparently more fearless than the character he portrayed. Harriet Eyley’s Zerlina and James Atkinson’s Masetto were well matched. This production still feels undermined by the statue – albeit draped – of the Commendatore being on stage from curtain up and before his actual murder, denying James Platt’s stone guest the final dramatic denouement. At least, the requisite punishing flames engulfing Don Giovanni do bring the image of the gates of hell full circle. Don Giovanni is at the Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff, 26-27 February and 17 March, then tours until 13 May.",Arts/Music,Don Giovanni review – strong cast ensure WNO’s revival stands the test of time,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/21/mozart-don-giovanni-wno-welsh-national-opera-review-andrei-kymach
2/21/2022,"It feels like a lifetime since Theresa May and Gina Miller were called “bloody difficult women” during Britain’s brutal and laborious war over Brexit. But the legal battle between the political opponents, and its lesson on accountability, are just as relevant today, according to the cast of a new play.  “With what’s happening in politics now, we realise the importance of championing protocol,” said Jessica Turner, who plays May in Bloody Difficult Women, which opens at Riverside Studios in London on Thursday. “At the time, we as a nation weren’t necessarily aware that the triggering of article 50 [the UK’s EU exit clause] could have been done through the royal prerogative or through parliament. Now we are much more aware of how important that stand was.” It was in 2016 that Miller, an anti-Brexit activist, decided to take the government to court over over its authority to implement Brexit without approval from parliament. She has said she was furious about people seeing themselves as above the law. Amara Karan, who plays the Guyanese-British business owner, said she hoped what Miller stood for was something “we can go back to … Particularly now with this conversation over public standards and the government breaking its own laws.” Miller, Karan added, “looks less of a pedantic person now. Someone has to make sure the rule of law is followed, otherwise our whole society collapses.” The play captures an episode of the Brexit story through the unfolding drama between May and Miller. The writer, Tim Walker, a journalist who has previously worked with Miller, has called it a “psychological human drama about idealism, obsession and delusion”. The themes it covers are as personal as they are political – there is much of the sexist and sometimes racist abuse and threats faced by Miller during the court case, as well as May’s ongoing struggle for the support of her party and country. Turner said it was a “huge responsibility” playing figures who are still very much in the public spotlight. “Particularly when everyone has such a strong image of a character like May.” Karan remembers following the news story at the time, and wondering why Miller was “taking on all of these causes. It seemed like a thankless job.” But since then, she’s “learned what she’s about, what her agenda is, where she grew up, the traumas she suffered” and found that she could relate to her more. “Lots of women in public have suffered all kinds of abuse and particularly women of colour,” she said. “I was scared for her, to be honest. It felt like it was this woman against the world. The language was becoming very violent and racist around Brexit. “I was really excited and struck when she actually won the high court case, and then the supreme court case, and then successfully sued Boris Johnson [In September 2019, Miller successfully challenged Johnson’s prorogation of parliament].” So what of the similarities between May and Miller? The play suggests they have more in common than meets the eye, including a stringent work ethic and a love of cricket. “I think what they have in common is being a woman in a man’s world,” Turner said. “They had to fight their corners. They’re both conviction politicians rather than career ones. Yes, May had ambitions, but she worked through the very basics of stuffing envelopes in her local party first.” In a demonstrative scene midway through the play, May and Miller address the audience. Miller says: “When a man takes a stand on something, he is seen as a maverick. But a woman doing this is considered mean.” May responds: “Women are not allowed to complain. If we do, we are whiny and hysterical.” The actors said the play was “very funny, but also a reflection of our times”. The last scene even leaps in time and is set in present day. “Accountability and the lack of it is very current,” Turner said. “So although it’s about something that’s happened in the past, and you might say that’s history, it’s actually very relevant now.” Bloody Difficult Women opens at Riverside Studios on 24 February",Arts/Stage,New play to tell story of Brexit’s ‘bloody difficult women’,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/21/new-play-brexit-bloody-difficult-women-miller-may
