12/30/2021,"RENO, Nev. — Google doesn't always know best. Despite warnings to avoid travel after a massive snowstorm that started Christmas weekend closed major highways, thousands of people insisted on trying to drive into or out of the socked-in Sierra Nevada. Some needed to get home. Some wanted to visit family. Some just wanted to play in the snow. Some were led astray by poor judgement. Many were led astray by Google Maps, which offered alternate driving routes that sent drivers to snowy dead ends. Northern California Highway Patrol reported a serious problem on Quincy-La Porte Road, which locals know closes each winter and becomes a haven for snowmobilers. But Google Maps doesn’t. When Interstate 80 closed, Google Maps offered up Quincy-La Porte Road as an alternate route. Hundreds of drivers tried that route. “It shows on the map it will go through, but there’s always a gate closed in the winter,” said California Highway Patrol Officer Brian Danielson, who works out of the Yuba-Sutter office. The two plows designated for the area got stuck and there were already hundreds of cars up there, Danielson said. “Those plows even had to get pulled out,"" he said. ""That’s how bad it was. “There were trees fallen across the road, power lines down. Some people just have the mentality, ‘I can get around this.’” Hundreds of cars piled up on the road over the weekend, eventually driving CHP to post “STOP TRYING TO USE THE BACKROADS TO GET TO NEVADA!” on social media. Nevada Highway Patrol was not immune from the shenanigans. Officer Charles Caster said he stopped a driver on Sunday who had 30 inches of snow atop his Ford Bronco. Caster told him to clear the snow from his vehicle before driving, and the driver replied, “Well, you should have seen it before.” There was the man who stopped in the middle of traffic on U.S. 580 in south Reno to fix the cable on his tire. The one, single cable (four are strongly recommended.) And there was the man who wanted to take his wife to dinner at the Ritz Carlton in North Tahoe. Caster stopped him from trying to go up Mt. Rose Highway, which was closed, and the man said he would try another route. “A three-hour drive just to go to dinner just because they came up to see the snow. These are the types of people who have no experience in the snow who may want to think twice,” Caster said. Caster told the man it wasn’t the day to try to get up to Tahoe. “I don’t know how far he made it, or if he made it.” On Monday, Washoe County Sheriff’s Office Search and Rescue Specialized Vehicle Unit and Incident Management Team rescued a family of five from the Dog Valley/Henness Pass roads area after the family tried to take the road on their way from Southern California to Truckee. While attempting to bypass the Interstate 80 closure, the family, which included children as young as 5, detoured onto the two-lane dirt road, which was buried in snow. They were stranded for two hours. There are illuminated signs warning drivers not to use Dog Valley/Henness Pass roads. “However, the family’s GPS won the battle of which technology to listen to,” according to a Facebook post from the Sheriff’s Office. From Sunday to Monday, Yuba-Sutter CHP’s graveyard crew ended up working a 20-hour shift rescuing a family trapped in a Suburban who had passed three road closure signs and were stuck in the snow. One plow got stuck. Then a second. Stop getting stuck on Marysville Road. Quincy-LaPorte Road is closed for the winter! None shall pass! pic.twitter.com/9TAsqEJyLv — CHP Yuba-Sutter (@ChpYuba) December 28, 2021 Jeremy Alcala, who owns B&K Towing, the only towing service in the region, was able to reach the family. But before he and CHP could safely tow them out, they had to wait for PG&E to clear downed power lines that had fallen during the attempt to rescue the family. “We’ve been running our butts off. A bunch of non-local people who haven’t wanted to read a sign,” said Krishna Alcala, who works as dispatcher for B&K Towing. She said the family in the Suburban was trying to get to Chicago. “It’s been very frustrating,"" she said. ""We’ve certainly never had a winter like this where people just don’t listen.” A lot of people think they can drive through the Quincy area when Interstate 80 is closed, said Quincy CHP Commander Chris Parent. “When people don’t normally drive in these conditions or they’re not seeing the signs that require chains, then they just end up in chest-high snow in a Honda Civic,"" said Parent. ""And it’s not going to work.""

12/30/2021,"Adam McKay’s newest movie Don't Look Up (now on Netflix), starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep, Tyler Perry and Cate Blanchett, tells the fictional story of a comet set to destroy Earth in six months — but could that really ever happen? Dr. Amy Mainzer, an astronomer and advisor on the movie, said it’s “really, really unlikely.” “The good news is a really major event like what's portrayed in the movie, we know that, that can't happen very regularly…because we're here,” Mainzer explained to Yahoo Canada. “If that sort of thing happened on a regular basis in our time span, compared to the span that humans have been on the planet, well we wouldn't be here."" “The last such major event was the one that wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. So we know that this is a very infrequent event, that said, smaller events can happen more frequently. So that's why we go out and we look for the objects and try to figure out where they are.” Mainzer and her team actually discovered Comet NEOWISE in 2020, the brightest comet in the northern hemisphere since Hale-Bopp in 1997. While Mainzer started working on Don’t Look Up before NEOWISE was discovered, some aspects of the comet in the movie were modelled after this particular real-life comet. “It had a pretty good set of orbital characteristics for what we were looking for, for the movie,” Mainzer said.”In fact, I even think I took some of the discovery images of comet NEOWISE.” “I looked at a bunch of different comet orbits and kind of picked one that I thought best represented what we were looking for in terms of the plot.” The movie starts when astronomy graduate student Kate Dibiasky (Jennifer Lawrence) discovers a massive comet, under the supervision of her professor Dr. Randall Mindy (Leonardo DiCaprio). While there’s excitement about the discovery, it turns out that it’s on a direct course to collide with Earth in six months, which would destroy the planet. Kate and Randall try to alert the public and government officials about the severity of this comet, but are just met with pushback, and even comet deniers who spread misinformation about the severity of the situation. Mainzer worked with both Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio on making their characters as authentic as possible, but specifically, Mainzer had several detailed conversations with Lawrence about being a woman in the male-dominated field of science and astronomy. “It's a historical fact that this field has been extremely male-dominated throughout most of its existence, and it is changing, more and more women are getting into the hard sciences, which is great to see, but we still have a really long way to go,” she said. “The movie, I think, touches on this in a couple of important ways, there are a couple of scenes where you can just sort of see Kate's face fall when she's not acknowledged for her important work in a couple of spots.” Ultimately, Mainzer hopes that people who watch Don’t Look Up will understand that scientists are “knocking [themselves] out” trying to bring their research and knowledge to the public. “The movie, hopefully, is a plea to make decisions based on the tools of science,” she said. “Science-based decision making is really at the core of this movie and the future, how we live as humanity on this planet, is very much up to us.” “So if we make good science-based decisions, we can avoid the worst outcomes, we can make them less bad. So let's do that.” In this time of the COVID-19 pandemic and the climate crisis, in particular, Mainzer said it is “absolutely frustrating” when scientists are sounding the alarm bells, but are met with pushback and counter arguments based on misinformation. “We are kind of hardwired…to fear the thing that's right in front of us, it's hard to sometimes grasp the immediacy of a problem with a gas that's invisible, or a virus that you can't see with your own eyes,” Mainzer explained. “Yet, it doesn't make it any less real and that's why I think we really want scientists to be seen as human beings.” “We do science because we love it and I hope that people take away from this is that we are trying to bring you the best and most accurate information that we can, even if the news isn't always good.”",News/Yahoo News Canada,Could a comet really destroy Earth like in 'Don't Look Up' on Netflix?

12/30/2021,"Bobcats typically roam alone, which makes a trail cam photo captured in Ohio a particularly rare find. A photo shared by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources shows five bobcats together in a wooded area — an uncommon occurrence for the animals that often roam in solitude. The department says the photo was captured on Christmas Eve in Washington County in the southeastern corner of the state. Many people commented with photos of their own bobcat sightings throughout Ohio, but often just with one animal. “I didn’t realize they ran in groups like that. I thought I read they were more solitary,” commented one woman. And she’s not wrong. As the Ohio Department of Natural Resources says, bobcats are reclusive animals that are “territorial and elusive by nature.” It’s unclear why the five bobcats were roaming together in Washington County. It’s “very unlikely” to spot a bobcat in the wild, the department says, but verified bobcat sightings have been on a steady rise in Ohio since 2005. “Bobcat sightings are expected to continue to increase in future years as the population increases in abundance and distribution,” the department says. Ohio University researchers found in a study published in November that bobcats are expanding throughout the state, particularly in the south and southeastern regions. “Southeastern Ohio, with its significant forest cover, remains the stronghold for bobcats in Ohio,” researcher Dr. Viorel Popescu said. “In addition to the hundreds of sightings over the past couple decades, there are many signs that lead us to believe that the population continues to expand throughout Ohio.” Bobcat plays with its live food ‘just like a house cat’ in Rhode Island video ‘Wrestling match’ involving rabid bobcat and Virginia man has captivated social media",U.S./Lexington Herald-Leader,Trail cam catches 5 bobcats roaming together in Ohio.

12/30/2021,"A cosmetics and skin care products company founded by married Taiwanese actors Zhang Ting and Lin Ruiyang has had assets worth 600 million yuan (US$94 million) frozen due to an investigation by China's market regulator over an alleged pyramid scheme. The market regulator in Shijiazhuang, the capital of northern China's Hebei province, said it had received several reports about a suspected pyramid scheme involving Shanghai Dowell Trading, according to a letter widely circulated on Chinese social media platforms on Tuesday. ""Because of its use of financial institutions to transfer or conceal funds involved in pyramid schemes, the administration has applied to the People's Court to take preservation measures under the law, and the case is currently under further investigation,"" said the letter dated last week.

Shanghai Dowell Trading responded on Wednesday, and said that it ""is a legally operating company that has always complied with the government guidance, adhered to the legal operation, and paid taxes according to the law"". ""We are very grateful to the Administration for Market Regulation of Shijiazhuang Yuhua District for guiding our company to check the risk; at present, the company is operating normally. Our company will actively cooperate with relevant departments,"" said the statement on the company's Twitter-like Weibo account. Shanghai Dowell Trading, which was founded in 1996, is the main operator of cosmetics and skin care products brand TST Tin'Secret, which lists Taiwanese model-actress Lin Chi-ling as a spokeswoman. Chinese actor Xu Zheng is also a former shareholder, while several famous Chinese stars have posted photos on social media using the brand's face masks. The Taiwan Affairs Office within China's State Council said at a regular press conference on Wednesday that the business incident had nothing to do with cross-strait relations.

Lin made a name for himself starring in the Chinese TV series Fantasies Behind The Pearly Curtains in the 1970s, while Zhang featured in the Legendary Chien Lung TV series in 1991. Pyramid schemes, which are illegal in China like many other countries, are businesses that recruit people whose job is to enrol others into the scheme rather than selling a specific product or service. The business model means only a few people at the top of the pyramid earn money, while the large number at the bottom will make little to zero return on their investment. Taiwanese actors Zhang Ting and Lin Ruiyang founded Shanghai Dowell Trading in 1996. Photo: Weibo alt=Taiwanese actors Zhang Ting and Lin Ruiyang founded Shanghai Dowell Trading in 1996. Photo: Weibo> They are similar to multilevel marketing in terms of structure, but do not involve a specific product. As early as 2016, the Beijing Youth Daily newspaper reported several skin irritation and acne cases caused by the face masks. The ""China Consumer Reports"" journal also featured cases of skin damage caused by the products as one of its annual cases as part of International Consumer Rights Day in 2017. Li Xu, the founder of the Chinese civil society organisation ""Li Xu anti-multi-level marketing team,"" said Shanghai Dowell Trading uses three typical features of a pyramid scheme, namely the need to pay a joining fee, the number of people involved and the method of payment. The correlation between agents' salaries and the size of their teams means the more members people bring in, the more commission they receive, he added. Li said traditional pyramid schemes are based on pure money flow and are more likely to gather funds in the name of investment, which differs from the current pyramid micronet businesses that own legitimate companies and products. ""They have legitimate companies as a cover and will even have celebrity endorsements, but it's still a pyramid scheme in nature,"" said Li. Shanghai Dowell Trading was recognised for making the highest annual tax payment in Shanghai's Qingpu District in both 2017 and 2018, with the company claiming to have paid 2.1 billion yuan (US$330 million) in tax in 2018 alone.

12/30/2021,"By Erwin Seba HOUSTON (Reuters) -The U.S. National Labor Relations Board on Wednesday impounded ballots that will decide whether the United Steelworkers (USW) continues to represent workers at an Exxon Mobil oil refinery in southeast Texas, according to the union and company. The NLRB has said it may impound the ballots while it reviews complaints filed by the USW union alleging Exxon barred workers from its Beaumont, Texas, plant on May 1 to break the union. The USW also charged the decertification campaign was improperly supported by the company. Exxon spokesperson Julie King said the company was told by the NLRB on Wednesday morning the ballots had been impounded and would not be counted until further notice. ""Exxon Mobil remains confident that it has acted in accordance with the law at all times, and the NLRB will dismiss these charges once they have completed their investigation,"" King said. USW International Representative Bryan Gross said the local hopes Exxon ""will end the lockout and get back to the table."" About the board's action, Gross said, ""We believe that's a positive. They've got enough evidence in our information and affidavits. We hope this lets the company know they need to get back to the bargaining table."" Exxon locked out union members from the 2,700-acre Beaumont, Texas, refinery and lubricant oil packaging plant on May 1 after contract talks failed to produce a new agreement. The facility produces fuels and Mobil 1 motor oil, and has continued to run with managers and replacement workers. The eight-month-long lockout will end if the about 600 union-represented workers vote to remove USW local 13-243 in Beaumont as their negotiating agent or accept the company's last contract offer, Exxon has said. Local 13-243 members rejected the contract offer in October. The refinery has continued to operate with managers and supervisors from around the nation at its controls. Exxon has said the 369,024 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery is operating at maximum capacity. Ousting the union would require a 50%-plus-one share of votes cast. However, the NLRB had warned it might impound the votes pending its finding on the union’s allegations that Exxon improperly supported the effort to remove the USW. Exxon proposed a contract with terms it said would allow the plant to be competitive in low-margin environments. The union has said it wants to keep provisions that give workers a say in job assignments. Negotiators have agreed to some parts of a possible contract, including a six-year term and pay increases that would match those to be set by national USW contract talks that begin in January. Workers were locked out at Beaumont because of a strike notice issued by Local 13-243, Exxon has said. The strike notice ""could not ensure safe continuous operations with the union being able to strike anytime with only 24 hours notice,"" it said. The USW said Exxon was preparing to lock out workers before the strike notice, pointing to portable housing for replacement workers installed inside the Beaumont complex in the weeks prior to the lockout. During the lock-out, the number of workers at the refinery represented by the USW has dwindled from 650 to about 580, as workers took jobs at other refineries or chemical plants in the region, people familiar with plant operations said.
