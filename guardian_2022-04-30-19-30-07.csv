4/30/2022,"A Metropolitan police officer has been given a final written warning after appearing on the Nigerian version of Big Brother without permission. A misconduct hearing found that PC Khafilat Kareem had breached the standards of professional behaviour in relation to “orders and instructions” and “discreditable conduct”, so a final written warning should be given after gross misconduct was proven. Kareem had requested unpaid leave to appear on the show in July 2019, and although permission for the leave was granted, she was not given permission to appear on the show. Shortly after the unpaid leave was granted, Kareem left the UK and took her work laptop with her without permission. When she appeared on the show, she surrendered her laptop to the show’s organisers. The panel, led by an independent legally qualified chair, found that Kareem had breached the standards of professional behaviour. DCS Andy Day said: “Permission was refused for PC Kareem to appear on the Nigerian version of Big Brother as it was felt it was not in the best interest for either her or the Metropolitan police service to take part. Despite this refusal, she went on the show anyway. “A detailed investigation was carried out by the Met’s directorate of professional standards which concluded Kareem should face gross misconduct proceedings. “Being a police officer means you must abide by the standards of professional behaviour. PC Kareem’s behaviour clearly fell far short and she has been given a final written warning.” The panel found this breach of professional standards, relating to the laptop, proven at the level of misconduct. Africa Magic, the TV company behind Big Brother Naija, said she had joined the show “so that she can do societal good”. A profile of Kareem on the broadcaster’s website said she would spend the prize money that was worth 30m naira (£68,000) to host a travel show touring Nigeria’s “beauty spots” and “invest in charitable causes”. Kareem was in the Big Brother house for 77 days before being voted out.",News/UK news,Met officer who went on Nigerian Big Brother given final warning,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/30/met-officer-khafilat-kareem-who-went-on-nigerian-big-brother-given-final-warning
4/30/2022,"Iam beginning a long farewell: by the end of the year, I will be gone from this garden and starting anew in Welsh soil. I am fantasising about having a garden that wraps around a house, but in truth I think I am gaining all of four metres, several of those in shade. Still, it is a blank canvas to paint on, and when I’m not heartbroken about leaving my fruit trees, I stand in my garden and make plans for what should come with me. I don’t want to leave this garden with great holes where I’ve uprooted established plants, so instead I am taking cuttings. I have already taken hardwood cuttings of all the soft fruits, vines and figs. But now that spring is in full swing, it is time for softwood cuttings of perennials: herbs such as rosemary, sage, lavender and savory, and deciduous shrubs such as hydrangea, buddleia, kerria or sambucus. As the name suggests, a softwood cutting is taken from tender new growth, which is ready to take root. If successful, softwood cuttings can be potted up by midsummer and have an extensive enough root system to survive the winter. Softwood cuttings are collected from the tips of new growth on a parent plant’s non-flowering shoots. Such new growth will lose moisture very quickly, so you need to take care to prevent wilting. Take a cutting early in the day, when the plants are turgid. If you have lots of cuttings to take, drop them into a clear plastic bag as you go as this will prevent precious moisture loss. Cuttings can be kept in the fridge for a couple of hours, but ideally you want to go from taking the cutting to potting it up as quickly as possible. The cutting should be about 10cm long, taken from above a bud on the parent plant. Then, using a sharp, clean knife, trim the cutting just below the node: this is the point just below the leaf joint where there are the most hormones. Remove any lower set of leaves so that you are left with a cutting between 5cm and 10cm long, with one or two sets of leaves. Now, pinch out the growing tip. Ideally specimens should be potted in seed or cutting compost; if you don’t have this, add at least 25% grit to some peat-free multipurpose. Insert the cutting with the first pair of leaves just above the compost. Label the pot, water it from above and keep it somewhere warm, but out of direct sunlight. You can cover the pot with a clear plastic bag to keep things moist. Remove the bag at least twice a week for about 10 minutes to ventilate the new plant. Keep the compost moist until the cuttings are well rooted, usually after four weeks.",Lifestyle/Life and style,New plants for free: how to propagate from softwood cuttings,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/30/new-plants-for-free-how-to-propagate-from-softwood-cuttings
4/30/2022,"Last week the University of California announced that the higher education system would waive tuition and student services fees for California residents who are members of federally recognized tribes. The announcement elated some Native people in California, who viewed it as a potentially life changing initiative. But it garnered harsh criticism from many others who are members of nations that aren’t federally recognized and are deeply disappointed that an institution that stresses acknowledging historical wrongs suffered by Indigenous people can in the same breath leave so many out of such an important resource. “Just like the other Native people who are enrolled, we suffer all the historical trauma and the legacy of the shortcomings and the crimes committed against our people,” said Jayden Lim, a 20-year-old Stanford University student and a descendant of the Pinoleville Pomo Nation. “Except the main difference is we don’t get all the benefits of being tribal people.” The UC initiative came as part of its launch of the Native American opportunity plan, which is meant to address the underrepresentation of Native students in higher education, including at the University of California. In fall 2021, of the nearly 300,000 students enrolled at University of California, only 0.5% were Native, according to the UC website. “I am hopeful that this new program will benefit our students and continue to position the University of California as the institution of choice for Native American students,” Michael V Drake, the university system’s president, wrote in the letter announcing the initiative. With 109 federally recognized tribes in California, it is clear the tuition funding will be beneficial to many Native people. The initiative comes as university tuition has become increasingly expensive, saddling many young Americans with student debt long after they start their professional careers. For state residents, tuition at the University of California is about $13,100, a sum that doesn’t include the many other costs associated with college, including housing and books. For the Yurok Tribe, in northeast California, the average income is roughly $11,000. Waved tuition could remove a significant barrier to higher education for the 6,400 tribal members, according to council member Phillip Williams. “I think this has brought so much hope to our youth; hope to our families,” he said. “We have a lot of talented young people here. We have an untapped resource of intelligence and ambition. And hopefully this can cultivate that.” Colorado River Indian Tribes chair Amelia Flores said she was pleased to hear the news, but added her tribe already provides college tuition for members who apply and meet certain requirements, such as a 2.5 GPA. But she said UC’s program could relieve some of this expense from the tribe, which in recent years has spent almost $3m annually on tuition assistance. But to some of the thousands of Native people across California not enrolled in a federally recognized tribe, the announcement was disappointing or even painful. Lim, the Stanford University student, can trace her Native ancestry at least as far back as 1850, when members of her family were massacred in northern California by the US military. She has a Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. And when she was 15, she delivered a speech in front of Michelle Obama, then the first lady, to accept an award as the representative of the California Indian Museum and Cultural Center’s tribal youth ambassadors. “I’m descended from a group of people that barely survived the colonization of California,” she told the audience in 2016. Lim hopes to attend the University of California, Berkeley for graduate school, where a Native American research center is named after her grandfather. But because of a “family feud” within her tribe, she said, she is not enrolled in a federally recognized tribe and therefore wouldn’t qualify for a tuition grant. “It kind of just felt like, once again, everyone who lies in this politically grey area gets swept under the rug, overlooked,” she said. For Lim it’s a dispute within her tribe; for others it’s tribal moratoriums on enrollment, being disenrolled because of internal politics, or being a member of one of the dozens of nations that despite fighting for years, are not federally recognized. The particular history of Indigenous people in California – including three waves of genocide that scattered and decimated communities, and land treaties never ratified and hidden for decades, leaving most Native people homeless – makes limiting funding to members of federally recognized nations especially glaring, said Joely Proudfit, director of the California Indian Culture and Sovereignty Center and American Indian Studies department chair at California State University San Marcos. “These various waves of colonization basically almost wiped us out,” she said. “It’s led to all of these dynamic, unfortunate problems, like identity politics, and who’s in and who’s out.” Proudfit, who is a descendant of the Pechanga Band of Luiseño Mission Indians, explained that there are many ways to prove someone is Native in California that goes beyond a federally recognized tribe’s enrollment, including a Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood, the California rolls and membership in non-federally recognized tribes. Stett Holbrook, a spokesperson for the UC president’s office, said the university system’s decision to limit the initiative to members of federally recognized tribes stems from Proposition 209, which prohibits affirmative action based on race at California public universities. “UC can provide financial aid to students based on their membership in federally recognized tribes because such membership is legally deemed a political classification, rather than a racial classification, due to the sovereign-to-sovereign relationship that the law recognizes between the federal government and federally recognized tribes,” Holbrook said in an email. He added that the UC president’s Native American Advisory Council, which includes tribal leaders, provided feedback on the plan. Proudfit suggested the university look to US Code 1679, whose eligibility requirements for California Natives to qualify for health services includes membership in a federally recognized tribe, but also such things as being a descendant of an “Indian who was residing in California on June 1, 1852” or holding a “trust interests in public domain, national forest, or reservation allotments in California.” She said: “Being recognized by the federal government to be on the rolls for healthcare, or for blood quantum or for certificate degrees of Indian blood is federal recognition. That shows your political status.” Louise Ramirez, chair of the Ohlone/Costanoan-Esselen Nation, said her nation has been fighting for federal recognition for decades. She described the UC’s decision as “discrimination.” She added: It’s “causing additional trauma to be carried forward on future generations”. In his letter, UC president Drake said that state residents from California’s non-federally recognized tribes could also receive scholarships from external organizations. On Wednesday, the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria announced a $2.5m scholarship fund for UC students from non-federally and federally recognized tribes. Across the US, several states, including Michigan and Minnesota, also have programs offering college tuition assistance for members of federally recognized tribes attending certain colleges. Others, however, award the funding based on broader criteria. The Montana university system, for example, offers tuition waivers for those enrolled in state or federally recognized nations or who have at least “one-fourth degree Indian blood.” Lim on Monday sent an email to the university detailing her family’s history with the school. Her grandfather was a lecturer there for nearly 30 years and her mother is a lecturer now: “My family has worked extremely hard to increase access for California Indians and this policy, as it currently stands, will not result in that outcome,” she wrote. She added: “I hope that you are able to revise this policy quickly in order to rightfully serve and uplift the descendants of all California Indian people.”",News/US news,University of California to waive tuition for Native students – but not for all,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/30/university-california-waive-tuition-native-students
4/30/2022,"The tiny village of Bamburgh in Northumberland, with its sweeping sandy beach overlooked by an imposing clifftop castle, has retained the title of Britain’s best seaside destination. The best beaches in the UK have been revealed in the annual survey from Which?, with the consumer watchdog surveying more than 4,300 visitors about recent trips to seaside towns, villages and resorts. The survey asked visitors to rate almost 100 destinations on factors including the beach, attractions, scenery, peace and quiet, and value for money. Bamburgh, with a population a little over 400, topped the charts with an overall destination score of 87% and visitors describing it as “spectacular”. Previously a winner in 2019 and 2021, Bamburgh was awarded the title for its three-mile stretch of golden sand, backed by a vast, tussock dune system and dominated by the epic Bamburgh castle. Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said: “With a busy summer predicted on British beaches, the vast spread of sand in Bamburgh means there is always space for your towel. That’s helped by the wind, whipping in off the North Sea, which keeps the sand looking freshly groomed and free of litter. “It’s a seaside visit at its most basic and best; with little to do but walk, run, or sip cups of tea from your flask from the comfort of your deckchair while watching North Sea waves roll by.” he added. Wales secured three of the top six seaside towns, with budget-friendly Llandudno claiming second spot overall with a score of 86%. The town’s biggest draw is the Great Orme, a limestone headland popular with climbers, which rises to over 200 metres and boasts “incomparable” views. Active visitors enjoyed lacing up their walking boots and hiking to the summit, while others opted to take the tram or open-sided cable car. Third place went to the Scottish seaside town of St Andrews with a score of 84%. Visitors praised the university town’s “youthful vibe”, quaint streets and historical sites, testament to its winning blend of sport, culture, sand and sea. Joint fourth winners were Dartmouth in Devon, where visitors enjoy steam trains and delicious seafood, and the seaside town of Tenby in Pembrokeshire, with its parade of pastel-coloured Georgian houses and selection of five-star beaches, from the golden sweep of North beach, peppered with rock pools and windbreaks, to Castle beach tucked into a cove, to the smaller Harbour beach. Propping up the table were the resorts of Skegness, Bognor Regis, Southend-on-Sea, Great Yarmouth and Burnham-on-Sea, all with destination scores below 51%. However, despite its low ranking, holidaymakers did have highlights to share from their trips to Skegness. Many recommended the Natureland seal sanctuary, with one visitor calling it “the sort of thing you expect to see on a David Attenborough programme”. Meanwhile, nostalgic attractions and amusement rides for children made the Lincolnshire coastal town a “proper” British seaside resort in the eyes of some respondents. Visitors to Bognor Regis found a “charming” town with the best climate on the south coast. Holidaymakers tipped the peaceful Pagham Harbour nature reserve and Hotham Park – a “little gem” – while the flat promenade was praised for being accommodating to visitors with limited mobility. According to Which?, the UK’s top 10 seaside towns are: Bamburgh, Northumberland Llandudno, Conwy St Andrews, Fife Dartmouth, Devon Tenby, Pembrokeshire St Davids, Pembrokeshire Aldeburgh, Suffolk Filey, North Yorkshire Conwy, Conwy Lyme Regis, Dorset",Lifestyle/Travel,Bamburgh tops list of UK’s best seaside towns,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/30/bamburgh-northumberland-tops-list-uk-best-seaside-town
