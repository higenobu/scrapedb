4/11/2022,"What is the chancellor going to do when figures charting Britain’s economic growth in February show the recovery from the pandemic was almost at a standstill before the invasion of Ukraine had started? Shopping and eating out became popular again after the restrictions put in place to deal with the Omicron outbreak were eased. Bookings at arts and entertainment venues increased. And the banking, insurance, legal and accounting sectors experienced another month of solid expansion, no doubt allowing City firms to repeat in 2022 the stellar bonuses paid to staff last year. However, manufacturing shrank and so too did the wider production sector as energy-hungry businesses cut back on their use of gas and electricity to leave GDP only 0.1% higher in February. Consumers were also beginning to feel the pinch from rising heating bills. The better-off might have ventured out to restaurants or to catch a show, but separate figures from the Bank of England show many families were ramping up their borrowing on credit cards in February just to keep their heads above water. Trade with Europe increased modestly month on month, which some analysts said was a welcome sign of a return to more normal times post-Brexit. That was not the view of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), which said a broader view of imports and exports with EU countries showed UK firms continued to struggle with the red tape left in place following the decision to quit the EU single market and customs union. Clearly, queues of lorries at Dover, some with rotting meat and vegetables on board, has nothing to do with the cost of living crisis or the war in Ukraine and everything to do with the prime minister’s decision to push for a hard Brexit. Rishi Sunak, meanwhile, is frustrated that demands for him to take further action fail to recognise all the subsidies he has put in place over recent months. There is £22bn of support from the government, he says, ranging from the 5p cut in fuel duty, at a cost of £2.4bn, to the freeze on alcohol duty that will knock £3bn from government revenues over five years. Of course most of the £9bn energy subsidy to households is in the form of a loan and will be clawed back by the exchequer. Nevertheless, he argues the whole package does enough to keep the economy afloat. Business groups are clear that the severity of the situation means he needs to go further, especially now that Russia’s invasion is on course to be prolonged, bringing with it further sanctions on the aggressor. Not only should there be a cap on household energy bills, there should be a cap for small businesses as well, said the BCC. The Confederation of British Industry said there should be more generous allowances to boost investment in new plant and machinery and a revised apprenticeship levy, to get round the red tape created by Theresa May’s failed plan to boost workplace training. Sunak, still coping with revelations about his personal finances, is expected to sit tight. Meanwhile inflation is soaring and the Bank of England has signalled its response will be to increase interest rates again in May. All that adds up to an even bigger cost of living crisis in the months to come.",News/Business,Sunak faces calls to do more to tackle UK slowdown – much to his frustration | Phillip Inman,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/11/sunak-faces-calls-do-more-tackle-uk-slowdown-frustration
4/11/2022,"Organisers of Sydney’s Royal Easter Show have shut down a ride and launched an investigation after a four-year-old boy was not secured to his seat. An image posted to social media appears to show the freefall ride had begun with a young boy on the end seat sitting with his harness still raised above his head, while other riders’ harnesses were locked down. The incident occurred on Sunday afternoon. Sky Boutsani Curtis, the boy’s mother, told the Daily Telegraph that the ride was stopped when onlookers shouted to alert the operator about the issue. Curtis said neither she nor her husband were tall enough to reach their son after it had stopped, and another father at the scene had to ask him to climb down from his seat so he could collect him. Eva Grace posted an image of the incident on Facebook on Sunday as a warning to other parents to be careful. “Make sure you’re watching the way they strap your child into a ride,” she posted. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a statement released on Sunday night, the Sydney Royal Easter Show announced the ride would be closed as the incident was investigated. “‘The safety of patrons at the Show is paramount and we have shut down the kids’ Free Fall [ride] following a reported issue with a harness,” the statement said. “The safety systems of the ride functioned well to prevent any injury occurring and the ride will not operate again until a full investigation has been completed and the ride has been approved by specialist engineers.” On its website, the Sydney Royal Easter Show describes the Free Fall ride as “a controlled drop that simulates the fear of falling” with “a gentle stop bringing them safely back to earth”.

4/11/2022,"When Kirsten was in her early 20s, she and her then boyfriend, later husband, were saving to buy a house. They had been together four years, and had enough that they were ready to see a mortgage adviser. But, she remembers: “He was avoiding me even going to the appointment, saying: ‘I can go on our behalf – it doesn’t need two of us.’” He had a good job, he was earning a decent salary, he had a nice car, they went on holidays. The first she knew of his £20,000 personal debt was when the mortgage adviser said: “There’s no point even applying for this: you’re not going to get it.” A survey in January by US News & Report sketched out how widespread so-called “financial infidelity” is. Some 30% of couples questioned by researchers described lies they had experienced or told in their relationship, the main one being secret purchases (31%), followed by hidden debts (28%) and dishonesty about income (23%). This is by no means a post-pandemic phenomenon, nor is it peculiar to the US. British research by Money Advice Service from 2015 also found one in five people lied to their partner about their earnings and one in four lied about their debt. The deceit can be a form of coercive control, as one person seeks to dominate the decisions of the relationship by hiding key information. It can also just be poor communication around money, combined with the powerful shame of debt, corroding trust inch by inch. And it can, of course, be driven by other lies, other humiliations; a gambling or sex addiction is incredibly hard to disclose, and neither comes cheap. But more frequently, says Susanna Abse, a psychoanalytic psychotherapist who often works with couples, the cash is just “dribbled away”. “In my experience, you generally can’t get to the bottom of what happened to the money,” she says. How often it leads directly to divorce is hard to say, for a number of reasons, including but not limited to the fact that separating couples always end up fighting about money one way or another. The way couples deal with money has changed radically over the past 25 years, Abse says. Feminists in the 70s and 80s tried to make joint bank accounts and money sharing the absolute norm because most women gave up work when they had children. “Now, because women mainly work, there is much more autonomy around money and no idea of sharing whatsoever. I see couples with two children saying: ‘I paid for the shopping and you haven’t paid me back.’” In the absence of any commonly held baseline assumptions about what is normal, couples are left negotiating from scratch what levels of autonomy and transparency they want and need. But that makes it sound quite easy. In fact, that intersection of money and feeling is intense and vexed. Sarah, a thirtysomething from Surrey, explains: “One of the things about this particular kind of deception is that it undermines everything. Every photo that pops up, everything you think back to, you think: ‘Could we really afford that? Was that holiday the reason he was in a really bad mood a month later and mean to me over nothing?’ If he’d had an affair for six months, those months would be a bit of a sham. But this feels like the entire relationship.” After that meeting with the mortgage broker, Kirsten was baffled, as she knew her partner didn’t gamble, didn’t smoke and didn’t drink much. He said he had built up debts when he was in his late teens, got into arrears and been too embarrassed to mention it, and she understood all that. They agreed they would have a joint account from then on and be honest with each other in the future. “I then became very intrusive about money,” she remembers, “which was fine when he was penitent. But later, when I was on maternity leave, it flipped. I would just catch him out in lies all the time but, by then, everything was my fault. His line was: ‘You made me lie to you. You were judgmental, you were intrusive, I knew how you would react if I told you.’” After clearing that first debt a decade ago, the couple bought a house, got married and started a family. Kirsten then found her husband had taken out another £40,000 in loans, as well as borrowing from friends, which had torpedoed their social life. “It literally is a web. He would find any reason for me not to come into contact with the people he knew. There are friends of his who still blame me for the money he owes them.” When they split up a few years ago, he hadn’t paid towards the mortgage for months. “I don’t think the anxiety and distrust will ever go away,” she says. “You might think you understand the concept of marriage, but it was only when he said: ‘I can’t afford to give you my half of the mortgage,’ that I realised, I’m still liable for the full amount. I can’t ring the lender and say: ‘My husband hasn’t got his half this month.’ I thought I was going to lose my home. I am still unbelievably embarrassed about the lies I believed.” Daniel Coombes, a director at the London divorce lawyers Family Law in Partnership, says: “I have to spend a bit of time explaining to people that they shouldn’t feel stupid, or guilty, or embarrassed, because it’s very common.” And that’s not just about hidden debt, that’s about finances across the board. It is not at all unusual for one person in a couple to know a lot more about the marital books than the other. But when it comes to divorce, “buildups of debt are a really sad situation. The court can only work with what exists. If someone has spent all the money, then it’s gone.” There is an exception, called the Norris add-back, “where you’re effectively trying to say: somebody has spent money inappropriately and I want you, Judge, to add that back to the pot so it comes out of their share of the assets,” Coombes says. But it’s not enough that the spending was done in secret; it has to have been “reckless and wanton”, and the threshold is comically high. Coombes recalls one case where the husband was shown to have spent a large amount of money on cocaine and sex workers, but because he had a serious problem with addiction, that wasn’t considered recklessness. “If it had been recreational, then maybe it would have been,” Coombes speculates, adding (with lawyerly caution): “It’s very hard to say; it would come down to the discretion of the judge.” Very often financial infidelity, or the extent of it, is not discovered until a divorce is already under way, and couples have to disclose their spending to each another. A lot of people don’t realise this is non-negotiable and that secrecy in the other direction – hiding earnings, building up a savings pot with the intention of separating – is a mug’s game, since it will come out in the divorce. People don’t always think rationally about money. Hoarding money secretively if you have no intention of splitting up is also a bit pointless, since you have to explain where it’s come from in order to spend it. You would effectively have to launder it back into your marriage. “I think if you’re stashing money away, you’re not really in the relationship entirely,” Abse says. “You’ve got one foot out.” Sarah first realised there was something awry with the family finances during lockdown, when she had the headroom to examine them. “Previously I just thought: ‘Gosh, we never seem to have that much left for saving.’” The couple had been together since university and had two children. Again, there had been a blip early on in the relationship where his personal debt came to light, and they figured out a plan to repay it together. But, more than a decade in, Sarah assumed that was in the past. It wasn’t until they were divorcing that she got a really forensic look at his spending. “At the moment, he’s about £40,000 in debt. It’s weird, it’s basically on nothing. It’s on excessive amounts of takeaways, coffee-shop spending. He’d go out for what I thought was a couple of pints with his mates – it was actually quite a few people and he was buying all the drinks.” “Sympathy” would be a strong word, but there’s definitely pathos in Sarah’s description of her ex. “We earned a good wage between us. We had a nice life. I feel like he’s sunk himself over Deliveroo.” What she doesn’t regret is the end of the relationship. “Just living with him became stranger and stranger. Our conversations made no sense, because I wasn’t party to all the information. Fifty percent of his brain was going on: ‘How do I get the result that I need out of this without her finding out X?’” So many things can drive secretive or impulsive spending: it can be an act of defiance, self-assertion, display, insecurity or retaliation. Often with couples who are mutually secretive, “it isn’t the money in the end”, says Abse. “It’s what the money symbolises about their fear of depending on each other.” Security is quite a nebulous concept, with many tributaries, but it feels very real when you lack it – so people attach it to money, which at least you can count, and end up “trying to earn more and more”, Abse continues, “with the idea of the magic figure: one day you’ll have this amount and then you’ll be safe”. Equally, though, you can get into debt because you just don’t have enough, and then find the shame so catastrophic that you can’t admit it. Alan, a fortysomething from Warwickshire, has been divorced for five years. He and his ex had always been quite aligned on their finances and bought a house that was “well within our means”. But then his wife stopped working due to an illness, at the same time as they started a family. He started putting basics, such as food shopping, on a credit card. “We weren’t splurging. There was nothing flash about our lifestyle, we weren’t spending on fancy cars, we didn’t have foreign holidays, we didn’t go out to eat three times a week. We were living a normal lower-middle class life, spending £200 a month more than we had. I just never felt strong enough to say: ‘We need to change the way we’re spending.’” It spiralled fast, with Alan applying for new credit cards and balance transfers as the 0% deals rans out. When they bought a buggy for their first daughter, he paid for it, panicking that she would look over and not recognise the card he was using. “It was terrifying for me if she did the food shop, because I was trying to tighten our belt without her noticing.” Things finally came to a head when he went to work having forgotten his packed lunch. “I had all these cards in my wallet and there was none of them that I could feasibly use to buy myself a sandwich.” When they finally had the conversation, this secret debt was £14,000. “It’s the value of a family car,” he says. “People take out a loan for 14 grand all the time and buy a Golf.” It wasn’t the money that sunk them, in other words, it was the fact, he says, that she felt completely betrayed. But even that isn’t a standalone fact. It’s underpinned by a lack of communication that itself feeds back to a lack of trust. “Before we got together, I could cut my spending if I wanted to save for something. I just never found a way to do that with someone else.” Lying about money is similar to having affairs only in the broadest sense that all dishonesty is alike. But even if the spending is irrational, the lies tend to be experienced as calculated, so may be harder to forgive than the weakness of the flesh. “In some ways,” Abse says, “it might be even more painful for people than sexual infidelity.” Some names have been changed",Lifestyle/Money,‘The anxiety and distrust will never go away’: how financial infidelity can hurt more than an affair,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/11/financial-infidelity-can-hurt-more-than-affair-anxiety-distrust
4/11/2022,"Nocturnal I knew a man once who wished he hadn’t been born.He meant what he said.He wasn’t a poseur.In the few, radiant years I knew himHe never spoke for effect. He said what he meant, I remember,quietly, thoughtfully,over tea and scrambled eggs on toaston one of those perfect morningsthat always followsa night of rapture. He had the bright way of speakingof those in the deepest despair.He made himself a joy to be with.He saw the funny side of almost everything. I knew he had meant what he saidwhen he departed decorouslywith sleeping pills and vodka.No noose, no razor blades, no blood in the bath,And nothing so wickedly inconsiderateas a sudden plunge under an oncoming train –he valued understatement. I shan’t reveal his name.He wouldn’t have wanted me to.He really did prefer oblivion.It was his chosen habitat. This week marks a happy return to the poems of the octogenarian writer, Paul Bailey. Bailey has recently tuned his gift for memoir to the key of poetry. His newly launched second collection, Joie de Vivre, celebrates survival, and looks back, in mischief and love rather than anger, on the variegated past. “Now I am gloomily gay, or gaily gloomy, / and philosophical,” his speaker concludes in Raised by Hand. There are smiles, painful and otherwise, hearty laughs and remembered plaisir d’amour in the assorted poems, translations and deliciously subversive prose anecdotes of Joie de Vivre. While being “gloomily gay” suggests a possibly dolorous note to the gayness (in both old and modern senses of the word) dolour couldn’t be farther from the Bailey style. Nonetheless, the gently sunlit landscape has its shadows. Death, too, gets the “philosophical” treatment, in the everyday, colloquial sense of philosophical that implies tranquillity and a certain detachment. These qualities are underlined in Nocturnal. One of its charms is that the narrative tone itself evokes the unnamed protagonist, the man “who really did prefer oblivion” yet “saw the funny side of almost everything”. No questions are asked by the narrator, no psychological investigations launched. The protagonist is not a “poseur”: his words are perfectly trusted, his stoicism made perfectly legitimate. Glancingly elegiac, the poem is less an elegy, perhaps, than a “refusal to mourn”, just as it is a rejection of the laborious virtue of positive thinking. A classicist would get it immediately. As WH Auden interpreted the ancient Greek perspective on existence: “Not to be born is the best for man.” Bailey’s title, Nocturnal, hints that there is a reason to mourn – and even what the reason might be. Loss is felt more acutely at night – especially if nights used to be shared with the one lost. Grief, memory and reflection are nocturnal “creatures” – like lovers. If the title is an invitation to emotion, the opening lines, crisply abrupt, deflect it. They assert an emotional distancing, not as a self-imposed strategy for handling grief, but as a means of both creating character and honouring that character, the man who “had the bright way of speaking / of those in the deepest despair,” (“of” here meaning “belonging to”). A lover’s delight remains irrepressible: there are “radiant years”, the nights of “rapture” and the “perfect” mornings. Bailey gets away with these platitudes of romantic love, because they’re the kinds of utterance an ordinary non-literary person would choose, sincerely lost for cleverer words, innocent of ironical quote marks. Such words have the glow of untarnished candour. They’re not the words of a “poseur”. Entering the cooler zone of vocal pitch, the fourth stanza is particularly agile. Bailey manages to contain the potential horror of the listed suicide-methods in a framework of lightly plotted verbal humour (“departed decorously”, “wickedly inconsiderate”, “he valued understatement”). There’s no mockery: again, the equilibrium of the speaker seems to mirror the mind of the man portrayed, to sustain his own sense of proportion, his wit, tact and insouciance. It would be unloving to regret the oblivion the lover has preferred and chosen. Bailey handles narrative in a style that’s informal and plain, but eloquently uncluttered. The free-verse stanzas make naturally musical paragraphs, with the rhythmic “punctuation” of the line-breaks exactly timed (though the care is lightly worn). Understatement, transparency and (above all) lack of literariness are unfashionable and rare among the “poetries” that make up the curious 21st-century composite, “poetry”. Bailey’s work offers pure refreshment. He has the right subjects for his style and a beautifully urbane voice, unique but never proclaiming uniqueness. Enlivened by curiosity, he always prioritises the stories and the characters they belong to.

4/11/2022,"Since Florida passed its controrversial “Don’t Say Gay” bill, conservative states across America have been taking on similar style bills as they attempt to ban the discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation in classrooms. Last month, Florida’s Republican governor Ron DeSantis signed into law the Parental Rights in Education bill. The law prohibits all discussion of sexuality and gender identity in schools, a move that advocates say will “erase” LGBTQ+ students and history. Since the bill’s introduction and passage, various Republican-run states have filed similar legislation that mimics Florida’s, reflecting a chilling wave of speech and identity restrictions across the country. Over 156 gag order bills have been introduced or refiled in 39 states since January 2021, according to a February report by Pen America, a nonprofit that seeks to protect freedom of expression in the US. At least 105 of those target K-12 schools, 49 target higher education and 62 include mandatory punishments for those found in violation. “Florida’s ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill is just the tip of the iceberg. While race, sex, and American history remain the most common targets of censorship, bills silencing speech about LGBTQ+ identities have also surged to the fore,” the organization said. In March, Georgia legislators introduced the Common Humanity in Private Education Act. According to the act, “No private or nonpublic school or program…shall promote, compel, or encourage classroom discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity in primary grade levels or in a manner that is not appropriate for the age and developmental stage of the student.” The act, which is sponsored by 10 Republican state senators, says “a focus on racial and gender identity and its resulting discrimination on the basis of color, race, ethnicity and national origin is destructive to the fabric of American society.” LGBTQ+ advocates in Georgia have pushed back heavily against the bill, arguing that it is not about parental rights but rather “restricting the activities, participation and learning” of children in schools. In Louisiana, a Republican state representative introduced a bill last month that seeks to ban discussions of gender identity and sexual orientation in certain public school classrooms. The bill, proposed by representative Dodie Horton, seeks to prohibit “teachers and others from discussing their sexual orientation or gender identity with students” from kindergarten through twelfth grade. It also seeks to also ban teachers and other presenters from discussing topics o sexual orientation and gender identity with students in kindergarten through eighth grade. In February, Republicans in Kansas introduced a state House bill that would make the depiction of homosexuality in classroom materials a class B misdemeanor. In Indiana, state legislators proposed a bill that would require schools to “obtain prior informed written consent from the parent of a student who is less than eighteen years of age…before the student may participate in any instruction on human sexuality.” The listed topics in the bill that would require parental consent includes abortion, birth control or contraceptives, sexual activity, sexual orientation, transgenderism and gender identity. Prior to obtaining written consent from parents, the bill would require schools to provide parents with “informed written notice which shall accurately describe in detail the contents and nature of the instruction on human sexuality, including the purpose of the instruction on human sexuality.” A bill introduced by Tennessee state Republicans in February seeks to prohibit any instructional materials that “promote, normalize, support, or address lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, or transgender issues or lifestyles”. In Arizona, proposed bills by Republican state senators include those that would block gender-affirming healthcare for transgender youth, as well as force teachers, nurses and other school staff to disclose a minor’s gender identity to their parents. Oklahoma state legislators recently passed a bill that prevents students enrolled in colleges from being “required to engage in any form of mandatory gender or sexual diversity training or counseling; provided, voluntary counseling shall not be prohibited”. The law also states, “Any orientation or requirement that presents any form of race or sex stereotyping or a bias on the basis of race or sex shall be prohibited.” Earlier this week, Ohio Republican representatives Jean Schmidt and Mike Loychik introduced a bill that would ban kindergarten through third grade classrooms from discussing sexual orientation and gender identity. Additionally, classrooms with older students would be disallowed from featuring those topics in ways that are “not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate.” In response to the bill’s introduction, Democratic representative Brigid Kelly called it a “huge problem} and said: “We’re not giving people access to the tools, the materials, the lessons they need to prepare children for the diverse world that exists.” Similarly, South Carolina state lawmakers introduced a bill that would ban state entities, including schools from subjecting students to “instruction, presentations, discussions, counseling, or materials in any medium” that involves topics including “sexual lifestyles, acts, or practices,” as well as “gender identity or lifestyles”. Additionally, like the Oklahoma law, another South Carolina bill seeks to prevent teachers, staff members and district employees from engaging in gender and sexual diversity training. In states such as Wisconsin and Rhode Island, personal pronouns have also become a contentious subject for conservative lawmakers. Both chambers of the Wisconsin legislature have approved a bill which has yet to be signed into law that includes a parent’s right to choose pronouns for their children. In Rhode Island, a proposed bill would require children to “be addressed by their common names and the pronouns associated with their biological gender” unless their parents grant permission to change them. “Florida’s cruel ‘don’t say gay’ bill is one of hundreds of anti-LGBTQ bills moving through state legislatures, most of which primarily attack trans youth,” the American Civil Liberties Union tweeted in February. “Censoring classroom discussions won’t keep kids from being LGBTQ. It just piles on to the national pattern of attacks,” it added.",News/US news,Republican-run states mimic Florida’s ‘don’t say gay’ bill in chilling wave of gag orders,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/11/republican-states-mimic-florida-dont-say-gay-bill
4/11/2022,"The world may be celebrating the 50th anniversary of The Godfather right now, but for paranoia aficionados, the biggest Francis Ford Coppola semi-centennial is still two years off. The Conversation came between the first two instalments of his operatic mafia trilogy but is stunningly different in mood. Starring an extraordinary Gene Hackman as a surveillance expert who fixates on a fragment of dialogue he has recorded, it culminates in Hackman tearing up his apartment as if he’s tearing at his own skin, all because of the tectonic shift in meaning that can come from a minute change of inflection. A lonely, desperate, guilt-ridden masterpiece. Jessica Kiang The maverick surrealist Salvador Dalí claimed to find his fantastic images by projecting his “paranoia” on to the world, seeing strange connections and double images all around him. That paranoid perspective rushes towards you in Suburbs of a Paranoiac Critical Town, his 1936 painting of an eerie town crumbling in delirium. An equine statue, empty armchair, mourning figures, deserted temple and impoverished street are all set against a barren plain of empty dread. The disconnected images are part of his paranoia, linked in an illogical narrative of fear. Yet his anxiety was justified, since this was painted in a Europe hurtling towards catastrophe. Dalí’s paranoia is disturbingly prophetic. Jonathan Jones On a space station, a crew of cartoon astronauts busily go about their duties. Except one of them is an impostor and, before long, crewmates start turning up dead. A group meeting is called, and everyone had better hope the blame isn’t pinned on them: the accused are ejected into the void; and in space, nobody can hear you scream. Is it any wonder that a multiplayer game as spectacularly paranoid as Among Us took off during the pandemic as, starved of social interaction, we found this mafia-inspired adventure to be the perfect arena for socially distanced suspicion? Keza MacDonald What woman hasn’t feared an imagined (or very real) danger following them on late nights? As such, it’s striking to consider what possessed Chicago house DJ Tyree to create the 1986 paranoia anthem I Fear the Night, articulating the dread that strikes when you are walking around on dark evenings. Although the lyrics are macabre (“Help me, please / It’s out to get me,” the vocalist known as Chic sings), its effervescent production makes the sound of impending doom deceptively fun; there’s something about the rhythm that makes nightfall less ominous and more thrilling.

4/11/2022,"In 1976 – regardless of whether he or anyone else thought so at the time – 19-year-old Chris Bailey was the voice of Brisbane. (I’m) Stranded, the first single he cut with his band the Saints, tore through like nothing else on the radio. Bailey’s singing recalled the young Van Morrison: impatient, howling, spitting out lyrics that radiated the indignities and frustrations of growing up in a city at the arse end of the world. Bailey’s former bandmate, guitarist Ed Kuepper, has always been at pains to stress that the Saints were not a punk band, because they formed – as Kid Galahad and the Eternals – in 1973, years before any stirrings of a musical movement. But it really can’t be said enough: with Kuepper’s roaring guitar sound, (I’m) Stranded – released in June 1976 – pre-dated the first UK punk single, The Damned’s New Rose, by several months. More important than chronology, though, was the Saints’ attitude. With no venues to play in Brisbane, they booked suburban halls. As their reputation spread, and the owners of those halls refused to host them, they put on gigs in their own share house, which happened to be right opposite Brisbane’s police headquarters. With no record company willing to touch them, they recorded, released and distributed (I’m) Stranded themselves on their own label. Along with Sydney contemporaries Radio Birdman, it was that self-sufficiency, as much as the Saints’ sound, that revolutionised the Australian music industry. But it also lit a fire in Bailey’s Brisbane that burned long after the Saints decamped for England in May 1977. By the time they left, a scene had begun to coalesce – the Go-Betweens and the Riptides, the Leftovers and Razar, the Fun Things and the Apartments. Robert Forster wrote in the Monthly that punk hit Brisbane like no other city in Australia because we had our own hillbilly dictator, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, “the kind of crypto-fascist, bird-brained conservative that every punk singer could only dream of railing against”, and we had the Saints, “the musical revolutionaries in the city’s evil heart” who gave a city that usually chased musical history its own place in it. It’s hard to explain Brisbane in the 70s and 80s – the crass venality, the routine brutality, the rank stupidity – to those who weren’t here. Think of Bjelke-Petersen as a prehistoric ancestor to Donald Trump, roaming the fetid swamps and jungles of Queensland, and you’re getting close. “Brisbane is so slatternly, so sleepy, so sprawlingly unlovely,” author David Malouf wrote in Johnno. It was, he said, “a place where poetry could never occur.” After Malouf, it was Chris Bailey who helped prove that wasn’t the case. In so doing, he inspired countless others here, this writer included, to find their voices too. The first three Saints albums are all Australian music milestones. Eternally Yours, with its astonishing lead track Know Your Product, and Prehistoric Sounds were a huge leap from (I’m) Stranded. Recorded in London with a horn section, they were an explosive fusion of rock, soul and R&B. very sad to confirm the news about Chris Bailey dying on the weekend. Chris and I met when we were about 14 during detention at Oxley High School and became close friends which later developed into what I always thought was an extremely strong artistic partnership, 1/2 pic.twitter.com/hQVKKHYgzT The original triumvirate of Bailey, Kuepper and drummer Ivor Hay splintered after that. Bailey kept the Saints name, which became a banner for a rotating series of line-ups. It was a messy decision, meaning the two epochs of the band would for ever be compared, and Kuepper and Bailey – one of the finest songwriting combinations Australia has produced – sparred constantly. But Kuepper was the first to say he couldn’t have wished for a better singer. Kuepper had written most of the music for the early Saints, and Bailey was determined to establish himself. The first EP after the split, Paralytic Tonight, Dublin Tomorrow, was released in early 1980; songwriter Paul Kelly said in his memoir How to Make Gravy that he “played it over and over again in a flat in Punt Road”. Musically, it still spat fire, and Bailey’s voice was maturing, his lyrics more reflective and dreamlike, especially on the magnificent Simple Love. Eleven more studio albums were released under the Saints’ name, plus a number of solo albums under Bailey’s own name. He increasingly turned towards a heartland rock sound, and had hits with Ghost Ships (1984) and Just Like Fire Would (1986). The latter was covered by Bruce Springsteen on his 2013 album High Hopes, and Springsteen opened his Brisbane show with the song on the E-Street Band’s 2014 Australian tour. Bailey himself had a tortured relationship with his home town. At what was meant to be a one-off Saints reunion at the University of Queensland in 2007 – the first time Bailey, Kuepper and Hay had played together in nearly 30 years – the singer paused before playing No Time, Stranded’s B-side, and told the crowd: “This is fortuitous – the last time we played this song here, we got kicked out.” Six thousand fans roared their approval back. As Forster once told me: “We all felt brushed by the Saints’ wings”. Like all good rock’n’roll stars, Bailey had the devil in him. But he sang like an angel that night.",Arts/Music,Chris Bailey of the Saints: the voice that tore through Brisbane and brought punk to the world | Andrew Stafford,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/11/chris-bailey-of-the-saints-the-voice-that-tore-across-the-world-and-changed-the-face-of-brisbane
4/11/2022,"Pep Guardiola said he didn’t want a “second of sadness” from his Manchester City side after Sunday’s 2-2 draw against Liverpool, but he also acknowledged his side had “missed an opportunity” to take a four-point lead in the title race. And that was surely as it was. xG models vary, but all had City as the victor, some by as much as 0.9 goals. And that is part of the oddity of this City: that dominance speaks of their extreme quality, but the failure to take advantage also hints at vulnerability. All of this, of course, should be prefaced by saying that City are a great side. So too are Liverpool. These are not just exceptional teams in the context of 2021-22 but in historical terms. City will win the league if they win their final seven games of the season, something that seems entirely possible – after all, they won twice that number in a row at the end of the 2018-19 season to hold Liverpool off. If they do win those seven, they will finish on 95 points. Only four teams in league history have ever got more than that – Liverpool and City twice each in the past four years. That inevitably adds a sense of the absurd to any talk of weakness. These are not flaws in a way football history has ever previously understood them. These are teams breaking records that have stood for well over a century. (And yes, it is reasonable to point out that, geniuses as Pep Guardiola and Jürgen Klopp are, and brilliant as these players are, the financial structures that have facilitated that level of domination are unhealthy, even if it’s probable that the points tallies of champions will fall back by five or 10 points when they are gone). But still, until there is perfection, there will be quibbles. City have not had the lower xG in the league since the penultimate game of last season when, with the league won and the Champions League final approaching, they lost 3-2 to Brighton. That is preposterous. That’s 32 league games in a row in which they have been (according to the algorithms) the better side, albeit a handful of them by narrow margins. The rest of the division should perhaps be grateful that they have dropped as many as 19 points in that run – five draws and three defeats. But the obvious question is, why do they drop points at all? After results that have not quite gone his way, Guardiola often blames issues in the two boxes – a lapse of concentration from a defender, a goalkeeping error, a moment of brilliance from an opponent at one end; a failure to take chances at the other. Missing opportunities, in particular, is a curiously psychological phenomenon – something that is, for now, beyond the scope of algorithms, although modern research does at least accept that confidence is a factor. Miss a string of chances and the self-fulfilling conviction grows that this could be one of those days: for Guardiola’s experience of that see, among others, Barcelona v Internazionale in 2010, Chelsea v Barcelona and Barcelona v Chelsea in 2012, Bayern v Atlético in 2016. When Raheem Sterling hit that early chance into Alisson’s body, it was possible already to see a narrative unfolding of City profligacy. As it turned out, Kevin De Bruyne put City ahead within 40 seconds and so the significance of the incident was diminished. Gabriel Jesus restored City’s lead with an astonishing finish, but there was also a moment in the second half when, having cut into the right side of the box and with a teammate on the six-yard line and two more arriving, dragged his effort into the side netting. Both Sterling and Jesus can at times lack a clinical edge. And yet Guardiola picked them for what was probably the biggest league game of the season. Both had vital roles to play, making runs in behind Liverpool’s high line, pressuring their defence. Sterling made 12 pressures in the final third, more than anybody else in the game apart from Jordan Henderson (and given City had 55% of possession, Liverpool inevitably made more attempts to regain it). Jesus’s role in trying to disrupt Andy Robertson was slightly different; only Bernardo Silva and Trent Alexander-Arnold attempted more tackles. They are players Guardiola trusts to fulfil his tactical instructions. To say that City need a striker, that they should convert more of their chances, is to miss the point that with an orthodox striker they may not create so many chances because they would not have such control. And control is critical because, like any side that plays with a high line, City are susceptible to balls played in behind them. Liverpool’s two goals were the result of moments of individual excellence – the first a crossfield pass from Thiago and then, after the initial clearance and Robertson’s cross, an astonishingly deft cushioned pull-back from Alexander-Arnold; and the second from Mohamed Salah’s perfect through-ball. To an extent, there’s not much an opponent can do against that – and yet those are the type of goals City tend to concede, the sort of incidents that keep costing Guardiola in the Champions League. It’s too easy to say that City would have won with better finishers because better finishers might not have generated the structures that created those chances, and might have allowed Liverpool more chances. The balance is key, and when it has come to a choice Guardiola has always prioritised the wider structure over ruthlessness in the box.",Sport/Football,Manchester City’s strive for perfection goes on as Liverpool highlight flaws | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/11/manchester-citys-pursuit-of-perfection-goes-on-as-liverpool-highlight-flaws
4/11/2022,"The environment secretary, George Eustice, has said other cabinet ministers may have held non-dom tax status, as he said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, had properly declared all his own financial arrangements. After it emerged Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty, was a non-dom, the health secretary and former chancellor, Sajid Javid, said he had also held the status for six years while a banker, allowing him to legally avoid tax on overseas earnings. Asked if he knew whether other ministers might come forward, Eustice said on Sky News: “Well I don’t, all I can tell you, as I said, I’m not the accountant for my ministerial colleagues in cabinet, I don’t know anybody who may or may not have had non-dom status. I can tell you that I never have and would never seek to have one.” On Sunday, Sunak wrote to Boris Johnson to formally ask that the prime minister refer his financial arrangements and declarations to Christopher Geidt, the independent adviser on ministers’ interests, for review. The move came after Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, wrote to Johnson and Lord Geidt seeking answers on issues including whether Sunak had benefited from the use of tax havens and whether his status as a green card holder while an MP and minister meant he had been legally a permanent US resident. Eustice said he was confident Sunak had done the right thing. “The man who is chancellor at the moment has paid all of his taxes and paid taxes on his income and declared all of that in the UK and he’s been clear about that,” he told Sky News. Sunak had asked Geidt to look into the matter, Eustice said. “He’s very clear that he’s declared everything that should have been declared at the right time and there is a process here that you have as a minister. “You declare all your interests to the permanent secretary in your department, and the Cabinet Office then decide which bits should be made public, which bits they should be aware of, there’s a duty of candour in both directions and Rishi’s very clear that he’s been very candid about his own arrangements at every stage.” But Steve Reed, the shadow justice secretary, said there appeared to be “a whole list of areas” where Sunak had not made proper declarations, meaning he had broken the ministerial code. Reed told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme Sunak had failed to declare Murty’s shareholding in the India-based IT company Infosys, founded by her father, a business that had held “15 different one-to-one meetings with senior ministers, including the prime minister, and has been awarded multimillion-pound government contracts”. He added: “Now, if the chancellor’s household is benefiting from contracts of that kind that should have been something that he declared in the register of interest, but he didn’t. There’s a whole list of areas where the chancellor appears to have failed to declare things he should have declared.” Asked about this on Today, Eustice said Murty’s shareholding was “public knowledge”. He said: “What ministers do is declare all of their interests to the Cabinet Office, and then they generally decide what’s right to be published and what’s not.”",News/Politics,"Other ministers may have held non-dom status but I never would, says Eustice",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/11/other-ministers-may-have-held-non-dom-status-but-i-never-would-says-george-eustice-rishi-sunak
4/11/2022,"Separate performances reserved for those who want to wear masks or socially distance should be held in theatres, the actor Liz Carr has suggested. The Silent Witness star was concerned that theatres were becoming inaccessible to people who have underlying health conditions as the number of people continuing to wear masks falls, despite a new surge in Covid infections. “Theatre should remain accessible even to those of us who have health conditions,” she told BBC News. Speaking backstage after she was named best supporting actress at the Olivier awards on Sunday for her role in The Normal Heart, she said: “If I’d had a five-minute speech, I would’ve talked about how I haven’t been to the theatre in over two years. This is a frightening night for me. “Now, you could say, ‘Yeah but you did a play, Liz, in front of 1,200 people every night’. “Yes, but I was on stage with everybody who was testing, everybody in the cast tested every day, so I felt safer than being a random member of the public in an audience around people I didn’t know. “I’m not sure about [the issue of] everybody wearing face masks. Personally, I think yes they should in indoor environments because Covid-19 is airborne. “But I think theatres could think about having safer performances. I think they should have face mask performances that are more socially distanced. In the same way you might have a British Sign Language performance, I think you should have Covid-safer performances.” The BBC reported that many arts and entertainment venues offer accessible showings – such as subtitled cinema screenings for deaf people – but few split audiences based on their wish to adopt a more cautious approach to Covid than is now required. “Some of my friends who weren’t ready to come and see the show, they came to see the dress rehearsal, because they didn’t feel safe enough to come,” Carr told the BBC. “So I think performances with less capacity and mandatory face masks, every show should be doing that to make sure theatre remains accessible even to those of us who have health conditions.” Last October, the Frozen actor Stephanie McKeon tweeted: “A plea to amazing London audiences: Please please please wear your masks in the theatre. We are working so hard on our end to ensure everyone is safe and to keep our shows running. We would be so grateful if you could help us out and do your bit too. Thank you.”",Arts/Stage,Actor Liz Carr calls for mask-only theatre performances,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/11/actor-liz-carr-calls-face-mask-theatre-performances-covid
4/11/2022,"Ministers should reconsider England’s “living with Covid” plans, health leaders have said, while accusing the government of ignoring the ongoing threat for ideological reasons. The NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across the healthcare sector, has accused No 10 of having “abandoned any interest” in the pandemic, despite a new Omicron surge putting pressure on an already overstretched NHS. “The brutal reality for staff and patients is that this Easter in the NHS is as bad as any winter,” said Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation. “But instead of the understanding and support NHS staff received during 2020 and 2021, we have a government that seems to want to wash its hands of responsibility for what is occurring in plain sight in local services up and down the country. No 10 has seemingly abandoned any interest in Covid whatsoever. “NHS leaders and their teams feel abandoned by the government and they deserve better.” Taylor later told BBC Breakfast: “In our view, we do not have a living-with-Covid plan, we have a living-without-restrictions ideology, which is different. We need to put in place the measures that are necessary to try to alleviate the pressures on our health service while this virus continues to affect [it].” He said ministers should restate advice promoting mask-wearing on public transport to try to cut the number of infections and, consequently, the demand on the NHS. “We need to renew the call for people to have vaccinations and booster vaccinations – there are still a lot of people out there who are not up to date with the vaccinations that they could have,” he said. “We need to resource the health service. At the moment, for example, the health service is providing free tests for its staff, which it needs to do because staff absences are really high in the NHS because of Covid. But the NHS has to pay for those tests. So, we need to put the resource in. Because we’re behaving as if this pandemic is over, but it is not over in relation to the challenges facing the health service.” A new Omicron wave has been putting immense pressure on the NHS. Last week, health bosses in England issued an extraordinary plea for families to help them discharge loved ones – even if they were Covid-19 positive – saying the service faced a “perfect storm” fuelled by heavy demand, severe staff shortages and soaring cases. “Our concern is that there is a lack of awareness and engagement with the pressures health service is under. And it’s particularly felt in hospitals [and] in the ambulance service – but it’s actually across the system as a whole,” Taylor said. “Although, of course, we’re much better at dealing with Covid than we have been in the past – fewer people die, fewer people end up in intensive care – it is still a disease that puts immense pressure on the health service. It is … adding to the demand which already exists – partly to do with the number of people who are waiting for treatment, which built up during Covid. “So we have a situation in our health service now which is as bad as any winter, even though we’re approaching Easter.” Taylor said that to make matters worse, the Treasury had “taken bites out of the already very tight NHS budget”, while soaring inflation meant the NHS settlement was now worthless. “It is now unclear that anyone in the centre of government feels the unfolding NHS crisis is their responsibility,” the FT quoted him as saying. The Department of Health and Social Care told the newspaper: “The success of our vaccination and antivirals programmes alongside increased public understanding on managing risk means we can start living with Covid – with public health guidance and free testing focused on groups who are most at risk from the virus.”",News/Politics,"Covid threat being ignored in England for ideological reasons, say NHS leaders",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/11/covid-threat-being-ignored-england-ideological-reasons-nhs-leaders
4/11/2022,"An SAS soldier who refused to answer questions about an alleged unlawful killing in Afghanistan has told the federal court he felt threatened to testify by the newspapers being sued by Ben Roberts-Smith. The soldier, anonymised before the court as Person 56, refused to answer questions about a 2012 mission to Fasil, where, it has previously been alleged, he and Roberts-Smith were responsible for the unlawful killing of two Afghan men who had been taken prisoner from a vehicle. Person 56 has been subpoenaed to give evidence by three newspapers defending a defamation action brought by his former comrade and Victoria Cross recipient, Roberts-Smith. Roberts-Smith alleges their media reports portrayed him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as acts of bullying and domestic violence. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. Person 56 said he objected to answering questions on the Fasil mission on the grounds of self-incrimination. His lawyer, Sean Richter, argued before court the offence to which he would incriminate himself was of “the most serious nature”. Justice Anthony Besanko granted Person 56 a certificate under section 128 of the Evidence Act, which would protect him from his evidence being used against him in Australian courts. But Person 56 still objected to giving the evidence and the judge did not compel him to answer. Person 56 is the third SAS soldier to appear in this trial who has refused to give evidence – for fear of self-incrimination – over an allegation they committed murder while serving in Afghanistan. Person 56 had previously sought to be excused from giving evidence, his lawyer citing the mental harm appearing in the witness box would cause him, compounded by his wife being ill. Arthur Moses SC, acting for Roberts-Smith, said in court there was a “deal” struck between the lawyers for the newspapers and Person 56 that he would not be pressed to answer questions about Fasil in exchange for him testifying about another 2012 mission, to the village of Darwan, where Roberts-Smith is alleged to have kicked a handcuffed prisoner off a cliff. “Your understanding … was that, if you did not agree to speak with the respondent’s lawyers about Darwan and help them get what they need for their case against Mr Roberts-Smith, then they would subpoena you as a hostile witness and ask you questions about other matters, including Fasil? “Yes,” Person 56. “And you considered that to be a threat?” “Yes.” In February, the court heard evidence from another Australian soldier on the Fasil mission, Person 16, who claimed Roberts-Smith boasted about shooting a captive, unarmed and handcuffed Afghan teenager who had been a passenger in a ute stopped by Australian troops. The court heard evidence the teenager “appeared extremely nervous and trembling uncontrollably” in the custody of the Australian troops. In their defence statement, the newspapers allege Roberts-Smith later shot the teenager with his pistol, and placed a weapon on his body to make his killing look legitimate. Person 16 told the court that when he asked Roberts-Smith what happened “to the young fella who was shaking like a leaf”, Roberts-Smith replied: “I pulled out my 9mm, shot the cunt in the side of the head, blew his brains out. It was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen”. In his evidence to the court last year, Roberts-Smith was asked about the alleged killing of the Afghan teenager at Fasil. He said the account was “baseless”, that he never said those words, and that the event could not have happened, because he never fired his pistol in combat while on deployment in Afghanistan. “I never had to engage with my pistol,” he told the court. Roberts-Smith also rejected assertions that he ever engaged in the practice of using “throw-downs”, a piece of compromising equipment, such as a radio or weapon, carried by soldiers and placed on the bodies of victims as a post-facto justification for their killing. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Roberts-Smith has maintained all of his actions in Afghanistan abided with the Australian troops’ rules of engagement, and the Geneva conventions. Also in February, the federal court heard that the newspapers believe Person 56 was responsible for killing another prisoner taken from the same vehicle during the Fasil mission. An emailed transcript of a phone call from a lawyer for the newspapers to Person 56’s counsel was read into court: “We know that Person 56 was the other person involved in the mission in Fasil and that he was a person who killed somebody.” “The 5 November incident is hotly contested,” the account of the phone call said. “The two people killed were killed by Ben Roberts-Smith and a member of his patrol we know to be your client [Person 56]. We think we can steer clear of all that stuff and just limit it to Darwan,” the email cited in court said. In September 2012, Person 56 was part of the Gothic 2 patrol commanded by Roberts-Smith that conducted a raid on the village of Darwan, in Uruzgan province. The newspapers allege in their defence that on that mission Roberts-Smith took an unarmed, handcuffed Afghan farmer, named Ali Jan, forced him to kneel near the edge of a 10-metre cliff, and kicked him off, before being involved in shooting Jan and dumping his body in a nearby field. Person 56 said he did not witness a kick or execution but was not with Roberts-Smith for the entirety of the raid, at one stage leaving the patrol to return an interpreter to another patrol. He told the court that after the mission, comrades in the regiment talked about an incident where “an individual had been kicked off a cliff and subsequently shot”. Roberts-Smith denies the Darwan allegations, and has previously told the court “there was no cliff … there was no kick”, and that the man purported to be Ali Jan was an enemy “spotter” who was lawfully killed in a cornfield within the military’s rules of engagement. Person 56 has concluded his evidence. But late on Monday, Moses, for Roberts-Smith, told the court he would seek to have an earlier soldier witness, Person 24, recalled to the court, arguing “there is a real concern Person 24 has perjured himself and his evidence has been interfered with by another witness in the case”. Person 24 gave evidence last month he witnessed Roberts-Smith marching a disabled man – with a prosthetic leg – out of a compound in the village of Kakarak before throwing the man to the ground and machine-gunning him to death. Person 24 described the 2009 incident as an “exhibition execution”.
