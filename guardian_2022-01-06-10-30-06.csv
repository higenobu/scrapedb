1/6/2022,"The road to Broadway now includes a stop at Rooty Hill. The Sydney Coliseum Theatre opened in the western Sydney suburb in December 2019, funded in part by the Rooty Hill RSL’s gaming revenue and designed to function as both a lyric theatre and concert venue that could attract major productions – and major names – to the region.  Now, by hosting a three-week season of The Little Prince – based on the beloved bestselling 1943 novella by Antoine De Saint-Exupéry and produced by the Broadway Entertainment Group – the venue has become part of an international pipeline. The production premiered in Paris in 2019 and made its Australian debut last year at the Sydney Opera House; in March, it lands at the Broadway Theatre in New York. The stage show is directed and choreographed by Anne Tournié, with co-direction by Chris Mouron. It is faithful to the book’s plot, language and structure, as well as its fabulist elements and its heartfelt insistence that the most valuable parts of life lie beyond work, routines, and habits. An aviator crashes in the desert and comes across the titular Prince (Lionel Zacharias, in bare feet and boasting a shock of blonde hair). He has left his tiny asteroid – where he rakes out the little volcanoes that come up to his knee and tends to a rose that has stolen his heart – to explore the world. This production is designed to travel. Built from a strong foundation of visual art and movement, it blends circus arts and dance on video projections that cover the floor and backdrop and relies on these non-verbal elements for the majority of its storytelling. For the rest, there is a Narrator, played by Mouron, who also adapted the novella’s text for the stage. She speaks mostly in English and occasionally in French (the entire work is sur-titled in English); sometimes, her voice lifts in song. She guides us through the scenes as the Prince travels through space to meet an arrogant king, a bustling businessman, and a drunk, among others, before landing on Earth and making a lasting impact on the aviator. It is still that aviator’s story, framed by his encounter with the Prince, which we see here, but Mouron speaks for every character as the story’s singular voice, and keeps the production tied to De Saint-Exupéry’s work by taking very few liberties with the language – it’s less of a new adaptation than a cross-artform translation. It’s as though the story is now a pop-up book being shown to us. Marie Jumelin’s video design is gently surrealistic, creating new skies and visual vocabulary for each planet on the Prince’s journey. When performers swing on aerial ropes to simulate flying, they seem suspended in the middle of the universe. There is often a riot of stars, which makes perfect sense: this is a story that looks constantly to the stars and remarks on their value. Against such detailed video, Tournié’s choreography is often necessarily simple, consisting mostly of bold and broad steps that immediately suggest meaning. The Vain Man (played by Antony Cesar and who, in the production’s most trite update, is obsessed simply with taking selfies) tumbles and break dances, performing tricks on tricks, while the Rose (the heart of the show and a clear audience favourite, played by Laurisse Sulty) is given romantic, balletic shapes. Acrobatic balancing balls cleverly represent planets – the Prince walks onstage on one in his first entrance, evoking the novella’s famous illustrations of the character atop his little asteroid. The ultimate effect is more beguiling than it is persuasive. The production is almost too true to the novella; at nearly two hours long, it begins to overstay its welcome (the opening night audience – children and adults alike – became audibly restless). While its reliance on video technology is its most dazzling element, it is also its riskiest; on opening night, the spell was broken when the show was stopped for 10 minutes waiting for a generator to kick in after a power cut in Rooty Hill. And it really does feel like a spell: the movement and swelling, wistful score (by Terry Truck) weave together an invocation of our better selves – the parts of us that can be moved to tears by the grace of a dancer reaching out her hand; the parts that find beauty and purpose in connecting with others; that part of us that wants to better the world within which we live and work and love. But, like any spell, it thrives on intention: for The Little Prince to work its magic on the audience, they must be prepared to give themselves over to it. Cynics will have a tougher time. Bring your softest self. The Little Prince runs until 23 January at the Sydney Coliseum Theatre. Mask-wearing for patrons over 12 is mandatory, although patrons may take them off to eat and drink. A reduced number of foyer bars are open, and lines are socially distanced. Double-vaccination status is checked at the door. The show runs for one hour and 55 minutes, including an interval, and is in an indoor theatre. In line with current state regulations, the venue is able to seat patrons at 100% capacity.

1/6/2022,"It was a day that shook America. Joe Biden will lead sombre commemorations on Thursday to mark one year since the US Capitol insurrection that left five people dead and the nation’s democracy wounded, and is expected to lay out the “singular responsibility” that Donald Trump has for the “chaos and carnage” of that day. In a speech, Biden will directly address the former president’s role in the attack and his attempts since to distract from or downplay events, the White House said.  Biden has been “clear-eyed” about the “threat the former president represents to our democracy”, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said in a briefing on Wednesday. Biden has repeatedly stated that Trump “abused his office, undermined the constitution and ignored his oath to the American people in an effort to amass more power for himself and his allies”, Psaki said. “President Biden will lay out the significance of what happened at the Capitol and the singular responsibility President Trump has for the chaos and the carnage that we saw,” she added. “He will forcibly push back on the lies spread by the former president in an attempt to mislead the American people and his own supporters, as well as distract from his role in what happened.” The president is also set to praise the bravery of outnumbered police officers on the scene and outline the unfinished work that America needs to do to heal, the White House said. Defeated in the 2020 presidential election, Trump incited his supporters to storm the Capitol and interrupt certification of Biden’s victory. Scores of police were beaten and bloodied and congressional offices were ransacked in the worst ever domestic attack on the seat of US government. Trump this week cancelled his own anniversary event – a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida that had been scheduled for the evening of 6 January – reportedly at the urging of advisers. A year on from the attack, polls show Americans are still divided in their perceptions of what unfolded and why. The anniversary offers Biden, who promised to bring the nation together, an opportunity to reassert a fact-based account. He and and Vice-President Kamala Harris will speak on Thursday morning at the US Capitol. “The president is going to speak to the truth of what happened, not the lies that some have spread since, and the peril it has posed to the rule of law and our system of democratic governance,” Psaki told reporters on Tuesday. Biden will put an extra spotlight on the role of Capitol police and others on the scene, Psaki said. “Because of their efforts, our democracy withstood an attack from a mob, and the will of more than 150 million people who voted in the presidential election was ultimately registered by Congress.” Psaki was asked at the press briefing what the president’s message will be to the many Republicans who believe Biden stole the election from Trump, despite overwhelming contrary evidence. “What he’s going to continue to do is speak to everyone in the country. Those who didn’t vote for him, those who may not believe he is the legitimate president, about what he wants to do to make their lives better,” the spokesperson replied. Other events at the Capitol on Thursday will include a moment of reflection with staff on the House of Representatives floor, a moment of silence on the House floor, a conversation with the presidential historians Doris Kearns Goodwin and Jon Meacham, testimonials from members of Congress and a prayer vigil. Four people died on the day of the riot and one Capitol police officer died the day after. Four officers have since taken their own lives. The crowd called for the then vice-president, Mike Pence, presiding over the electoral college vote count, to be hanged. But Trump, fellow Republicans and rightwing media personalities have pushed false and misleading accounts to downplay the attack, calling it a non-violent protest or blaming leftwing activists. Even Pence has dismissed it as “just one day in January”. Congressional Republicans are expected to keep a low profile or stay away from Thursday’s events. Trump had been expected to create a split-screen moment by pushing his counter-narrative at a televised press conference, but he abruptly scrapped the plan on Tuesday. In a statement, the former president criticised a House select committee investigating the 6 January insurrection, which continues its work and on Tuesday issued a letter seeking the cooperation of the Fox New host Sean Hannity, who exchanged messages with Trump and his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, in the days leading up to the attack. Trump said that he was cancelling his conference “in light of the total bias and dishonesty of the January 6th Unselect Committee of Democrats, two failed Republicans, and the Fake News Media”, and would address the issue instead at a rally in Arizona on 15 January. The ex-president was reportedly talked out of holding a press conference by allies. Senator Lindsey Graham told the Axios website that he discussed the subject with Trump over a weekend golf match in West Palm Beach, Florida, arguing that “there could be peril in doing a news conference … Best to focus on election reform instead.” Separate from the House investigation, the justice department is leading the prosecution of rioters who invaded the Capitol. More than 700 people have been charged so far in one of the biggest criminal investigations in American history. More than 30 have received jail sentences. Trump was kicked off Twitter after the Capitol attack for statements encouraging violence. He was impeached by the House but acquitted by the Senate, leaving the way open for him to seek the White House again in 2024. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll found that 72% of Republicans say Trump does not really bear responsibility for what happened, 58% of Republicans believe Biden’s election was not legitimate and 40% of Republicans and independents say violence against the government is sometimes justified.",News/US news,Capitol attack: Biden to stress Trump’s ‘singular responsibility’ on anniversary,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/us-capitol-attack-anniversary-joe-biden-police
1/6/2022,"It will be like a real-life Frayed, I joked to friends. We’ll appear, slightly disoriented, in Sydney’s southern, faded beach-side suburbs, a place I thought I’d long since left behind. I’ll even wear the dresses. After 18 years of living in the UK, returning to Australia with a small family in tow was always going to be an adventure/insane, especially in the middle of a pandemic. But my head was only filled with the good stuff: the smell of eucalyptus, glimmering green ocean pools, the warm embrace of family and friends, and sweet non-Covid freedom.The reality, as always, was something else. Because moving home meant moving back in – at least temporarily – with my parents, and to the house I grew up in.  “It won’t be for long,” I assured my husband, who looked a bit pale every time we went over the plans involving his in-laws. “It might even be nice? Anyway, we’ll find our own place really quickly.” But I was wrong. Naively, I thought the heart-stopping lead up to escaping plague island would be the worst of it. Negotiating what to do if the sudden cut to arrivals caps meant we got bumped off our flight at the last minute, job interviews at ungodly hours in a half-packed up house, keeping the kids isolated for the last week as Delta tore through our village, saying goodbye without actually going inside anyone’s house – surely these were the hardest moments? Quarantine, we foolishly reasoned, would be a breeze in comparison. After arriving on a ridiculously empty plane (12 passengers) and being ushered into our confines, it was clear that once again, we were mistaken. You don’t truly know the meaning of panic until you spend two weeks in an apartment with a balcony 30 floors up and a fearless, outdoor-loving three-year-old. On our penultimate day in the high-rise prison and after four Covid tests, a doctor, soldier, policeman and a nurse knocked on the door. It sounded like a bad joke. “Well you’ve tested negative,” the doctor said, as all four of us lined up in front of them. “But now we are just going to … um, look at you.” We stared back – pasty white, full of two weeks’ worth of quarantine food and stale air. “Yep, you look healthy,” he said. The truth, though, is that we looked like shit. Our day of release into the Australian wilds came. An hour after scrambling into my dad’s car we were at the beach, diving into the cool, clear water as Australians in winter coats looked on in horror. And suddenly we were back. Back in my old bedroom, an achingly bad Smashing Pumpkins inspired mural staring at me from above the cupboard doors (what is it that compels parents to only preserve the embarrassing things?). Back around the dining table I spent my childhood at, squabbling with siblings. Back at my old primary school, so that I could enrol my son, while wondering what kind of life choices we were making. Back in my old neighbourhood, despite, many many moons ago, gleefully joining a FB page “I left the shire”. Back in a country where Covid, unlike in the disease-ridden nation we’d just left, seemed like a relatively new phenomenon. Our conversations on the pandemic were thrust 18 months in the past. “Well you don’t understand, we haven’t had Covid here, until now!” “But you don’t understand how many lockdowns we’ve lived through!” Perhaps a bit more unexpectedly, other facets of Australian life made us feel we’d flown into the past. “Is it electric?” My three -year-old would always ask when he saw other people drive to the house (but obviously, not enter). Eight years since being wed, I found myself reunited with my maiden name when authorities refused to recognise my British marriage certificate. “But it’s the same head of state!” I wailed at various uninterested call centres. Waiting days for bank transfers, not being able to buy booze in the supermarket, a government that won’t address the realities of climate change (guys, even Boris Johnson talks about it) – the time warp was everywhere. Some things had changed though – mainly the horrifically bloated house prices and impenetrable rental market, meaning our stay at casa parental appeared infinite. In the first few days, some rules were laid down. Mainly for the kids … I think. There was the hot water limit, no sand in the washing machine, and a special area the two boys were forbidden to enter, where my dad kept a prized clarinet. It didn’t take us long to break them. The next day, I spied my youngest, crouching silently in the no-go zone, concentrating, his sweaty hands fingering the keys. There was also work to negotiate in this topsy-turvy world. I walked into my first day at the Guardian, not by prancing into a bustling newsroom, but by stepping into the fibro granny flat, where my nan once lived, to sit at a rickety camping table upon which I tried to steady my laptop and monitor. Oddly, my dreams of our new life had not included my mother bursting into work meetings holding a kilo of raw chicken and launching into a raft of complicated cooking options, or my dad rushing past to use the spare fridge as I attempted to look vaguely professional on a Zoom call. Salvation did come though. Three months after setting foot on Sydney soil/sand, we escaped to our own place. A day after moving out we nipped back for some leftover bits. “I miss you!” my mum exclaimed as I entered the hallway. I looked at her, quizzically. “Are you sure?” I ask, while scanning the house, which now looks clean and calm. No screaming children flying through the kitchen or pouring all the bath water onto the floor or eating all the Tim Tams. “Yes” she says, with meaning. And in a moment, I remember why, despite everything, coming back was also the best.",Opinion/Opinion,Moving back to Australia mid-pandemic was like entering a time warp | Jacqueline Housden,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/06/moving-back-to-australia-mid-pandemic-was-like-entering-a-time-warp
