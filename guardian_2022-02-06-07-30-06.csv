2/6/2022,"For my first trick? End a 14-year trophy drought of course. For all Antonio Conte’s talk of future title challenges, an infinitely more achievable here and now is FA Cup glory. And the Italian has history, reaching the final twice with Chelsea, victorious the second time around. If the season is to end in silverware, Harry Kane seems intent to be the man to lead them. Perhaps it is premature to speak of such things, but he has the bit back between his teeth.  Having arrived as substitute to spare Spirs’ blushes against League One Morecambe in the previous round, a brace under the Saturday night lights helped secure much safer passage to the last 32. In doing so the England captain grabbed goals 24 and 25 for club and country in what is supposed to be a season of discontent. Kane’s sumptuous opener was followed by an unfortunate own goal. Graham Potter’s side deservedly got back into it in the second period through Yves Bissouma. Kane’s response was swift and fatal. After relatively manic Mondays and near fortnight breaks, both Conte and Potter were doubtless keen to return the narrative to on-field matters. A barometer of managerial attitude toward a cup competition comes between the sticks; both first-choice goalkeepers – Hugo Lloris and Robert Sánchez – started. Conte had Son Heung-min and Cristian Romero available after injury, while deadline day duo Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski were amongst the substitutes. The lure of a return north-east was too much for Dan Burn to resist, so Lewis Dunk’s return was timely for Potter. As was the widely-courted Bissouma’s, after missing a fortnight on duty for Mali. Brighton’s philosophy under Potter is based on passing from the back. But for the opener that proved their undoing. Seconds previously, the visitors had got away with one when Sánchez’s miscued clip in Adam Webster’s direction just evaded Kane. Rather act as a warning, that simply served for Webster to become an unlikely guilty party. Mooted for an England call-up, his ability on the ball caught Jamie Carragher’s eye in Brighton’s last trip to London. But Son – full of zip – nipped in, stole possession and found Kane via Pierre-Emile Højbjerg. Not that a goal was a formality mind; Kane still had plenty to do, but produced a curled edge-of-the-box finish. Going behind is not new to Potter’s side, who have now netted first in just eight of the 27 games across all competitions this season. And a little hiccup will not see them depart from their principles. But what felt like a terminal blow came 24 minutes in. Emerson made a powerful, if lonely, surge forward on the break, and his cross took a wicked deflection off Solly March to leave Sánchez helpless. The Brazilian sprinted toward the bench appearing to shout toward the crowd; rather than a confrontation though, he simply sought liquid refreshment. Brighton’s luck was summed up when Bissouma deceived Harry Winks to open up a space 20 yards out, only for his left-footed strike to roll harmlessly wide off his standing foot. Jakub Moder might have done better from Neal Maupay’s lay-off shortly before the break. Leaning back, his scoop was never troubling Lloris. Potter tinkered at the interval, Joel Veltman replacing Adam Lallana. That allowed a switch to a back four, giving Marc Cucurella, one of the Premier League’s stand out roaming full-backs, licence to push forward. And they almost found an instant route back into the game, Moder shooting narrowly over immediately after the restart. Soon after, Lloris did well to shift his weight rapidly when Bissouma’s attempt threatened to wrong-foot him after deflecting off Romero. Encouraged, Potter turned to Moisés Caicedo just hours after arriving back in England. Three minutes after his arrival, Brighton were deservedly back in it, Bissouma this time the beneficiary of a deflection off Højbjerg. If anyone on the pitch deserved a slice of luck, it was Bissouma. Any nerves on Tottenham’s behalf were only momentary. Son burned past Webster and into the box. The Brighton defender did well to seemingly cover but failed to clear and Kane was able to slide in at the back post. A madcap spell nearly continued but Maupay’s attempted dink was straight at Lloris. Conte then used his years of nous to draw sting from the tie with a double substitution that included debutant Kulusevski. Bentancur followed not long after, picking up a quick booking. Kulusevski might have had an assist had Steven Bergwijn not blazed over.",Sport/Football,Harry Kane doubles up to steer Tottenham past Brighton in FA Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/tottenham-brighton-fa-cup-match-report
2/6/2022,"All too aware of a desire within the dressing room he leaves, and offered only a short-term contract extension by a board that had put the pro in procrastination, Justin Langer quit as head coach of Australia on Saturday. The question now, after a week of bloodletting in English cricket, is whether one of the Baggy Green’s most devout acolytes will cross the Ashes divide. And it will be asked. Andrew Strauss, England’s interim director of men’s cricket after Ashley Giles, Chris Silverwood and Graham Thorpe were sacked, is usually cautious when discussing recruitment. But at Lord’s on Friday he happily engaged with the subject of Langer’s candidacy, 24 hours before the decoupling from Cricket Australia was sealed, saying: “He will be one of the names [in the frame].”  Strauss is a longtime friend and admirer, writing in his 2013 autobiography that Langer was “one leader I consider myself very fortunate to have worked with” after their time at Middlesex. He also praised “a gritty little fighter” who, while “a little intense”, was “passionate, driven and hated the lazy, in-your-comfort-zone attitude displayed by so many county cricketers”. Quite how England’s players would feel about this prospect is another matter. Hotels were shared throughout the Ashes, relations were cordial while a 4-0 pasting was being dispensed and the subject of Langer’s future was said to be a regular topic of chatter on the Australian side when he was not within earshot. By all accounts, little of it was positive nor hopeful of his contract being renewed. Come the end of the series there was only one outcome. Three nights out from the fifth Test in Hobart a group that included the captain, Pat Cummins, David Warner, the assistant coaches, Michael Di Venuto and Andrew McDonald, plus other backroom staff members, met at a bar called The Den in Salamanca and discussed who they would like to replace Langer. As reported in the Guardian, a head coach like Trevor Bayliss, renowned for not sweating the small stuff, is the type of figurehead they are hoping for. While sidelined towards the end, Langer’s time with Australia ends with the two trophies England coveted. Though there may be reservations, England’s cricketers have very little clout after a record nine Test defeats in 2021 and scant performances of note. As passionate and talented with the bat as Joe Root is, he chiefly remains captain for next month’s Caribbean tour due to a lack of alternatives. Strauss said as much on Friday, bemoaning the fact so few players had grabbed their chance of late. So if there is a belief from above that a cosy environment needs shaking out of its torpor – and Root requires a more hard-edged head coach alongside him – then Langer could fit the bill. Though the 51-year-old bleeds gold and green, Cricket Australia’s bungled handling of their team’s desire to move on – one that denied a great of their game a hero’s send-off – could work in England’s favour. But then the permanent head coach is a few steps down the line for English cricket and only part of what is being described as the “red-ball reset”. Strauss must first install an interim head coach and convene a selection panel to pick a squad to face West Indies – a team that knows all about such existential crises but has lost one Test series at home to England in the past 54 years. Having ruled himself out of the director’s job long-term due to family commitments, Strauss must also start the search for the permanent successor to Giles. The new director of cricket will hire the new head coach (Strauss will be on the panel) and decide whether the task is now so all-consuming by way of headspace and fixture list that it needs to be split into separate Test and white-ball appointments. Certainly a return to having a national selector appears on the cards, Giles having described it as “antiquated” on sacking Ed Smith last April, only for Silverwood to struggle with the additional burden. Once the setup is reconfigured and a path laid out, Strauss’s continuation in an advisory capacity is almost guaranteed and the former Test captain represents a life raft of proven cricketing competency for Tom Harrison to cling on to. The ECB chief executive is seven years deep with a waning mandate, no permanent chair above him, an independent board made up of corporates and a team beneath that has been over-stretched and distracted by the evangelical pursuit of the Hundred project. After taking charge in 2015, Harrison has twice gone 12 months without deigning to speak to the media but over the past six – during the fires of the sport’s racism crisis and the meltdown of the flagship men’s Test team – he has been forced to become a regular in front of the dictaphones and cameras, not to the mention two chastening appearances in front of MPs in parliament. The governing body also almost fully drained reserves that sat as high as £73m in 2016 just before the ill-wind of the pandemic swept through, forcing cuts and redundancies. Harrison, weeks away from his share of a £2.1m executive bonus scheme, has overseen the aggressive white-ballisation of English cricket but now states with certainty he is the right person to sort out the Test mess that resulted. It all sounds a bit Downing Street, as does talk of an independent review into the domestic game because if past such exercises are a guide, the ECB will cherrypick the conclusions. Take the Schofield Report, commissioned after the 2006-07 Ashes whitewash. Among its 19 recommendations, it said domestic formats must mirror those played at international level, while the volume of cricket must be slimmed down at county level and for the national team in order to allow players to “prepare, perform, repair and regenerate”. This does not quite tally with the subsequent expansion of the T20 Blast, the introduction of a fourth competition in the Hundred – a format not played anywhere else – nor that in 12 of the 15 calendar years since the report’s publication England men have played more than 40 international fixtures, having never done so previously. Overseas development programmes, such as the placements in Australian grade cricket, were another suggestion, only for these to be slashed in recent times and the budget transferred to you know what. The report also called for improved development of English coaches but Strauss conceded that the search to find the right candidate(s) will have to be global again. Whether this is Langer or otherwise, if the “red-ball reset” is to take place it will require more than just filling a handful of management positions.",Sport/Sport,Justin Langer in the frame for England coaching role after quitting Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/05/justin-langer-in-the-frame-for-england-coaching-role-after-quitting-australia
2/6/2022,"The Queen has expressed her “sincere wish” that the Duchess of Cornwall becomes Queen Consort when Charles becomes king. In a candid message marking the 70th anniversary of her accession, the monarch made clear her desire, unambiguously paving the way for Queen Camilla.  When the duchess married the Prince of Wales in 2005, it was made clear by Clarence House that she would carry the title of HRH The Princess Consort. It has long been speculated that this was a title of convenience at a time when the duchess was seen to be less popular in the polls, due to her relationship with Charles when he was married to Diana, Princess of Wales. Charles is understood to have long harboured a firm desire his wife should carry the title of Queen Consort, and be thus crowned and anointed, when he becomes king. The Queen made clear she supported this in a written message released on Saturday before Sunday’s Accession Day. In it, the Queen thanked the nation for the “loyalty and affection” she had received over her long reign. She added: “And when, in the fullness of time, my son Charles becomes King, I know you will give him and his wife, Camilla, the same support that you have given me; and it is my sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort as she continues her own loyal service.” The Queen has recently signalled her strong support for Camilla, making the duchess a Royal Lady of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, in recognition of her contribution to the monarchy. Many observers saw this as a step towards confirming Camilla would be accorded Queen Consort status. Senior royals clearly feel public opinion about Camilla has changed in recent years with her popularity growing, and that this historic moment in the Queen’s reign as she marks her platinum jubilee is an appropriate time to end speculation about Camilla’s future title. At the time of her marriage to Charles, many questioned that she could not be styled Princess Consort and that protocol dictated she would be Queen Camilla in any event, in the same way the Queen Mother became Queen Elizabeth when she married George VI. The Queen, who will mark the 70th anniversary of her accession in private at Sandringham on Sunday, said in her message that it was still a day “even after 70 years, I still remember as much for the death of my father, George VI, as for the start of my reign.” She renewed the pledge she first gave in 1947 “that my life will always be devoted to your service.” She also paid tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh, who died in April aged 99 after being at her side during 73 years of marriage. She said: “I am fortunate to have had the steadfast and loving support of my family. “I was blessed that in Prince Philip I had a partner willing to carry out the role of consort and unselfishly make the sacrifices that go with it. “It is a role I saw my own mother perform during my father’s reign.” She reflected on the “goodwill shown to me by people of all nationalities, faiths and ages in this country and around the world over these years.” “I remain eternally grateful for, and humbled by, the loyalty and affection that you continue to give me.” It is not the first time the Queen has expressed her “sincere wish” on a delicate matter. In 2018, she ensured Charles would succeed her as head of the Commonwealth, after much debate over who her successor would be. She voiced her views the day before top government officials from the 53-nation body met at Windsor Castle, saying it was her “sincere wish that the Commonwealth will continue to offer stability and continuity to future generations and will decide one day the Prince of Wales should carry on the important work started by my father in 1949”. Unsurprisingly, after that declaration, the Commonwealth agreed Charles, who was not a universally popular choice, should succeed his mother as head. Camilla would technically have been Queen when Charles acceded to the throne, and only legislation would have prevented it. But royal aides insisted, when she married Charles in 2005, that Camilla did not want to be queen and said originally that the former Mrs Parker Bowles “intended” to be known instead as Princess Consort – the first in British history – instead. Any mention of “Princess Consort” was removed from Charles’s website during a revamp in 2018. Former BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt said: “This is the most extraordinary message. The Queen is ensuring the transition, when it comes, to her son as king is as seamless and trouble-free as possible. “She’s future-proofing an institution she’s served for 70 years. And for Camilla, the journey from being the third person in a marriage to queen-in-waiting is complete.” Women married to a monarch have historically been crowned Queen Consort. Such was the case for the George VI’s wife, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, and for George V’s wife Queen Mary – the Queen’s grandmother. The exception was Queen Mary II who, with her husband, King William III, was joint-Sovereign from 1689 to 1694. The royal website used to declare: “A Queen consort is crowned with the King, in a similar but simpler ceremony.” But after Charles’s marriage to Camilla, it added the get-out clause “unless decided otherwise”. Queen Victoria’s husband, Albert, was appointed Prince Consort 17 years after his marriage. He worked diligently to win the public’s affection after suffering initial hostility. Victoria had wanted him to be King Consort when they married, but the then prime minister Lord Melbourne ruled it out. The Duke of Edinburgh did not hold the title Prince Consort, having rejected the offer in the early years of the Queen’s reign. Camilla may be destined to be a Queen but not the Queen. The Queen is Queen Regnant, a female monarch equivalent in rank and title to a king, who reigns in her own right. A Queen Consort is the wife of a reigning king. While a Queen Regnant possesses and exercises sovereign powers, a Queen Consort – such as the Queen’s mother, who became Queen Elizabeth when George VI became king – does not formally share her spouses powers.",News/UK news,Queen wants Camilla to be Queen Consort when Charles becomes king,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/05/queen-wants-camilla-to-be-queen-consort-when-charles-becomes-king
2/6/2022,"Eddie Jones refused to blame Luke Cowan-Dickie for a painful opening Six Nations defeat as England suffered a second successive loss to Scotland for the first time in 38 years. The visitors had transformed a 10-6 half-time deficit into a 17-10 lead with 15 minutes left at Murrayfield after two penalties and a try from the fly-half Marcus Smith but the momentum swung decisively in the 66th minute when Scotland stand-off Finn Russell launched a crossfield kick towards wing Darcy Graham. The airborne Cowan-Dickie patted it forward with both hands into touch and Ben O’Keeffe, the New Zealander referee, ruled the England hooker’s act was deliberate and awarded a penalty try, with the resultant yellow card leaving the visitors a man down at a critical juncture.  “That happens in the moment,” Jones said. “He played exceptionally well for us and he is very disappointed but all the boys are supporting him. We don’t apportion any blame to Luke – the referee adjudged it was a yellow card and we have to get on with it. “We had opportunities to kick on, but we just weren’t clinical enough. We are massively disappointed we lost and Scotland deserved to win. I thought we dominated lots of the game but didn’t get points out of the domination. Rugby is a simple game: when you dominate, you have to get the points.” Jones also defended his decision to replace Smith with George Ford immediately after the youngster had put England seven points clear on the scoreboard. “It’s a 23-man game, mate,” he said. “We felt George could come on and do a job for us in the last 20 minutes. “It’s a tough one for us. For a young team I thought we fought well and played well; we just didn’t get the result. Last time against South Africa [in November], we got the penalty at the end – this time they got it. We just have to go to Italy next week and win now.” The game ended with a sequence of four reset England scrums with the clock deep in the red. Tom Curry, the captain, said “it felt like we had domination” but no penalty was forthcoming and Gregor Townsend admitted his heart-rate was “the highest it had been throughout the whole game”. “I’m glad it wasn’t decided by a scrum decision and we had to defend their attack,” the Scotland coach said. “Fortunately we got the ball back. “This fixture means a lot to us and means a lot to our people. It will make everyone really happy for maybe 365 days, but certainly the next few days. That is a strong England side. The way they attacked and with the power of their pack, they will cause some damage to teams in this competition.” Townsend praised his side’s resilience in coming back from a 17-10 deficit to earn their third win over England in five years. “We didn’t start the second half well but in the last 20 minutes we played really well and got our attack going in difficult conditions. “I am really pleased with the character, the belief, the effort and the skill to find ways of creating tries and scoring points. We were not at our best but our defence was outstanding.” Scotland will now head to Cardiff next Saturday aiming for a first win in the Welsh capital for 20 years, before hosting France, the favourites, in their third game on 26 February. “Belief is a massive weapon,” Townsend said. “We know we are going to have some really tough challenges, especially in our next two games. We haven’t won in Cardiff for a long while but we know we can play better. If we want to deliver something special, we have to play well next week.” The one downside was the sight of Jamie Ritchie being carted off on the hour with an injury to his groin area. “He is a in a bit of pain and I wouldn’t expect him to be available next week,” Townsend added.",Sport/Sport,Eddie Jones says Luke Cowan-Dickie blameless after mistake at Murrayfield,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/05/eddie-jones-says-luke-cowan-dickie-blameless-after-mistake-at-murrayfield
2/6/2022,"Boris Johnson’s dwindling inner circle greeted his double appointment last night of Steve Barclay as the new chief of staff and Guto Harri as director of communications at No 10 as proof that the prime minister was a man of his word – and one who acted fast. Conor Burns, one of Johnson’s cheerleaders, tweeted: “He is delivering. @SteveBarclay is a talented and serious Minister and @Guto_Harri is a professional operator. Both great appointments.”  But elsewhere the appointments – made necessary by the resignation of five Johnson aides last Thursday – caused almost universal bafflement. Barclay is MP for North East Cambridgeshire and also sits in the cabinet as chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He will now be chief of staff and “in charge of integrating the new Office of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet Office, driving the government’s agenda more efficiently and ensuring it is better aligned with the cabinet and backbenchers”. Jonathan Powell, who served as Tony Blair’s chief of staff, said the appointment appeared desperate, and he was amazed it had been approved by the cabinet secretary, Simon Case. “Steve Barclay MP as chief of staff?” Powell wrote on Twitter. “Does he resign as an MP? Or is he answerable to parliament? I can think of no democracy where the chief of staff can also be in the legislature. “I found being No 10 chief of staff a full time job. Not sure how it could be combined with representing a constituency. And having to go to answer parliamentary questions about the PM would be tricky. Who pays his salary – does it count against the ministerial salaries limit? Amazed that the cabinet secretary has agreed to this. It all seems a bit desperate.” The return of Harri to Johnson’s side as director of communications – he served in the role for four years during Johnson’s time as mayor of London – was met with even more disbelief given Harri has hardly been his most vocal supporter recently. In 2018 Harri said Johnson would be “hugely divisive” as prime minister, a remark that has proved prescient. Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s former adviser, wasted no time before he too was on Twitter saying: “So our new boss is a pro-Remain lobbyist who’s said the PM is ‘sexually incontinent’, ‘hugely divisive’, ‘destructive’, ‘dragging the country down’, & picked ‘wrong side’ in referendum’ GREAT.” Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, was also scathing. “Boris Johnson is panicking as he frantically rearranges deckchairs. The prime minister has clearly run out of serious people willing to serve under his chaotic and incompetent leadership so now expects a cabinet minister to be his chief of staff,” she said. “This is a farce. Being No 10 chief of staff is a 24/7 job so if Steve Barclay is taking it as his third job then Tory MPs and the public can have no confidence that the dysfunction in Downing Street will come to an end. Steve Barclay’s constituents and the public deserve more respect. So much for Boris Johnson’s promise to get a grip. Instead this is just a further collapse into chaos.” Johnson said the new appointments would help drive his government forward, adding: “I promised change, so that we can get on with the job the British public elected us to do. We need to continue our recovery from the pandemic, help hundreds of thousands more people into work, and deliver our ambitious agenda to level up the entire country, improving people’s opportunities regardless of where they’re from. “The changes I’m announcing to my senior team today will improve how No 10 operates, strengthen the role of my cabinet and backbench colleagues, and accelerate our defining mission to level up the country.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson’s new aides are greeted with bafflement,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/05/boris-johnsons-new-aides-are-greeted-with-bafflement
2/6/2022,"15 Stuart Hogg (capt) Another excellent Six Nations performance for the catalogue. Kept busy by England’s varied kicking game but coped well. 9  14 Darcy Graham Excellent work in buildup to White’s try to wrongfoot Marchant and made a scintillating break in the second. 8 13 Chris Harris Is growing in stature as one of the best defensive centres in the northern hemisphere. Not many frills but a calming presence. 7 12 Sam Johnson Two carries for six metres – he was another victim of how little ball Scotland enjoyed in the first half in particular. Defensively solid, though. 5 11 Duhan van der Merwe Felt hard done by when penalised with Scotland well placed and always looked dangerous when in space. 8 10 Finn Russell Has a knack of upping the tempo with one perfectly fizzed pass and after a quiet start he grew in authority. 8 9 Ali Price Off for HIA on 13 minutes – and his replacement scored a dazzling try while he was receiving treatment – but proved his worth when returning. 7 1 Rory Sutherland Not his best performance in that Sinckler got the better of him at scrum-time. Schoeman was more involved when he came on. 5 2 George Turner Ran a decent lineout despite Itoje and Isiekwe doing their best but did not offer much with ball in hand before he was replaced. 6 3 Zander Fagerson Put England under pressure at the breakdown and got through plenty of tackles in a busy first 52 minutes. 7 4 Jonny Gray Having missed the autumn internationals his was a welcome return to the Scotland boiler room. 7 5 Grant Gilchrist Got through a mountain of unseen work and is developing into one of Scotland’s most reliable forwards. 7 6 Jamie Ritchie A real menace in his hour on the pitch. It was not always legal but most of the time it was effective and his injury-enforced withdrawal was a blow. 8 7 Hamish Watson Not many of his barnstorming carries but Scotland edged the back-row battle and he has to take his fair share of credit for that. 7 8 Matt Fagerson Led the resistance, tackling everything that moved as England dominated possession and territory in the first half. 8 REPLACEMENTS: Stuart McInally (for Turner 52) Improved things 7; Pierre Schoeman (for Sutherland 52) Got stuck in 7; WP Nel (for Z Fagerson 52) Strong scrummaging 6; Sam Skinner (for Gray 63) Crucial late lineout steal 7; Magnus Bradbury (for Ritchie 60) Strong showing 7; Ben White (for Price 59) Fairytale try 7; Sione Tuipulotu (for Johnson 60) Couple of carries 6 15 Freddie Steward First away performance for England suddenly not looking so assured under the high ball. That may sound harsh but a wobble was inevitable. 6 14 Max Malins Plenty of early touches, cutting infield and taking on his man on the outside but couldn’t deliver a telling contribution that a more specialist winger might have done. 5 13 Elliot Daly Flitted between centre and wing but showed some classy touches in both positions. Should he have demanded a late shot at goal? 7 12 Henry Slade Did his best to prise open Scotland’s defence but was well shackled, often facing two-man hits. 6 11 Joe Marchant Outfoxed by Graham for White’s try but stuck to his task. Not as involved as he would have liked. 6 10 Marcus Smith Backline was a bit clunky but England’s boy wonder took matters into his own hands with a fine try. England unravelled almost immediately after he went off. 8 9 Ben Youngs Clever break when England were searching for some inspiration but his kicking seemed a little prescriptive and was less effective as a result. 6 1 Ellis Genge Likes playing here, having scored the decisive try two years ago and gave it everything but was unable to influence proceedings as much as he’d have liked. 6 2 Luke Cowan-Dickie Can’t argue with his yellow card nor the penalty try decision – it was blatantly slapping the ball into touch and a deliberate knock-on to boot. Costly. 4 3 Kyle Sinckler Won a scrum penalty, gave one away just before half-time and showed his delightfully soft hands. A typical performance from a player now established as key member of England’s pack. 7 4 Maro Itoje Tried to get to Hogg for opening try but that ultimately created the opening. England’s go-to man at the lineout and was influential in his side’s maul dominance. 7 5 Nick Isiekwe No major complaints on his return to the side after a long wait but England lost the battle of the back five of the scrum. 5 6 Lewis Ludlam Palpably fired up on first start since this fixture two years agoin 2020. Tried a bit too hard at times but England went backwards when he went off. 6 7 Tom Curry (capt) Vowed to lead by example and always gets stuck in but this was the kind of match where England needed cool heads as the temperature rose. 6 8 Sam Simmonds Made an eye-catching break down the left on his first start for four years and a crucial tackle on Van der Merwe when the Scot was flying. 7 REPLACEMENTS: Jamie George (for Cowan-Dickie 77) Lineout stolen n/a; Joe Marler (for Genge 63) Lineout throw didn’t work 4; Will Stuart (for Sinckler 63) Solid 6; Charlie Ewels (for Isiekwe 77) N/A; Alex Dombrandt (for Ludlam 63) On the fringes 5; George Ford (for Smith 63) Poor penalty to touch 4; Jack Nowell (for Marchant 80) n/a",Sport/Sport,Scotland 20-17 England: Six Nations player ratings from Murrayfield,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/05/scotland-20-17-england-six-nations-player-ratings-from-murrayfield
