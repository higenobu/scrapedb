2/18/2022,"Manchester City are close to signing the 17-year-old Brazilian winger Sávio from Atlético Mineiro. A medical has been scheduled after talks reached their final stages over a deal for City to pay €6.5m (£5.5m) plus add-ons and commit to a sell-on clause. Paperwork to complete the transfer is due to be prepared soon. Arsenal and the Red Bull group, whose stable of clubs includes RB Leipzig and RB Salzburg, were also interested in Sávio but City accelerated their pursuit of the Brazil youth international in the hope of winning the race to sign him.  Sávio, who made his Atlético debut in September 2020, could be loaned to PSV Eindhoven next season if, as expected, City conclude a deal. With the Premier League transfer window shut, he will stay with Atlético over the coming months. City struck a similar deal to buy another teenage Brazilian forward, Kayky, from Fluminense last April. He joined last summer and has made brief appearances in the FA Cup and Premier League.",Sport/Football,Manchester City close to sealing deal for teenage Brazilian winger Sávio,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/17/manchester-city-close-to-sealing-deal-for-teenage-brazilian-winger-savio
2/18/2022,"Leicester teetered and could have slumped to another disappointing result in a season of stutters. Instead they rallied and took a big step towards the last 16 of the Europa Conference League, in the process ending a five-match winless run. They were in danger of extending that streak when Vito Hammershøy-Mistrati struck before half-time to cancel out Wilfred Ndidi’s opening goal. But Harvey Barnes, Patson Daka and the excellent Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall then found the net to leave the second leg of this looking like a formality.  As supporters made their way into the stadium they may have paused at the spot outside the north-western corner of the ground where, according to plans released by the club on Thursday, a statue will be erected of the late chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha. News of the tribute was warmly welcomed by Leicester fans. The Europa Conference League, by contrast, does not yet inspire much love – especially around these parts, with Leicester having gone into this season’s European campaign with far higher ambitions than to advance in the continent’s third-tier competition. Brendan Rodgers made plain his lack of interest in the tournament in the immediate aftermath of Leicester’s elimination from the more vaunted Europa League in December but, as this tie drew closer, he insisted that he had come to terms with where his team currently are and wanted to win the tournament. With his team already out of the FA Cup and in the bottom half of the Premeir League, this represents their only chance of claiming silverware this season and their most likely route back into Europe. “We will give everything we can to do that,” said Rodgers. The Danish Cup winners, playing their first competitive match after a winter break of more than two months, were not expected to prove an insurmountable obstacle. Ademola Lookman, chosen instead of James Maddison, could have opened the scoring in the second minute but his control let him down when a shot by Harvey Barnes ricocheted to him six yards out. Leicester controlled possession early on but a sloppy pass by Kasper Schmeichel in the sixth minute served as a reminder of the defensive problems that have undermined their season so far. One minute later the goalkeeper had to make a save for the first time, holding a long-range shot by Alhaji Kamara. Then Patson Daka was given two great chances to score. First he flicked a header over from six yards after a sumptuous cross by Youri Tielemans, and then he let the ball run away from him after being put clean through by Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, who was also wasteful in the 15th minute when he failed to finish a cross from Lookman. Ndidi broke the deadlock in the 22nd minute with a goal of nimble construction after a half-cleared corner. Ndidi played a one-two in the box with Lookman, who cut the ball back to him from the byline, and then poked the ball past the keeper from eight yards. Leicester did not create a chance to add to that until Dewsbury-Hall was denied by Patrik Carlgren just before half-time. From the ensuing corner the goalkeeper denied Caglar Soyuncu before Daniel Amartey nodded wide from two yards. If the failure to extend their lead was frustrating, Rodgers was soon angered by his side’s all too familiar inability to hold on to a lead. Randers drew level before the break when Tosin Kehinde profited from a slip by the makeshift left-back, Marc Albrighton, and sent in a low cross from the right. The unmarked Hammershøy-Mistrati arrived into the box to guide it past Schmeichel from 10 yards. Leicester emerged for the second half like a team eager to atone. Within five minutes they were back in front, Lookman and the impressive Dewsbury-Hall tearing open the visiting defence before Barnes spooned the ball into an empty net as Carlgren got stranded off his line. This time Leicester did not let up. Daka made it 3-1 five minutes later with an instinctive tap-in after a foxy run and shot by Tielemans. As defenders appealed for offside, the striker was presumably grateful that VAR will not be used in this tournament until the final. The Belgian twinkled again moments later to create a chance for Lookman, whose ferocious shot was beaten away by Carlgren. As the home side’s confidence soared, Daka spun beautifully past his marker and forced another save from the keeper from 20 yards. Dewsbury-Hall got the goal he deserved when Kelechi Iheanacho won the ball and fed Lookman, who teed up the midfielder for a simple finish from eight yards.",Sport/Football,Patson Daka and Harvey Barnes help Leicester run riot against Randers,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/17/leicester-randers-europa-conference-league-match-report
2/18/2022,"Daryl Powell’s unbeaten start as the Warrington coach continued as his side recorded a comfortable victory over his former club Castleford, who remain without a win to their name so far in 2022 under their new coach, Lee Radford. After a hard-earned victory at Leeds last weekend in Powell’s first match in charge, their second consecutive win of the new Super League season was rather more straightforward. Warrington were never behind here against a Tigers side still yet to get going this year, and visibly adjusting to life under Radford with more difficulty than the Wolves are under Powell.  Perhaps most encouragingly of all, you sense his new side still have several more gears to click through, too. Their half-back partnership of George Williams and George Widdop look to have settled well under Powell, a coach renowned for promoting an attacking style of rugby league. The early signs for the Wolves look to be very healthy: in stark contrast to his former club. Castleford started brightly and looked in a position to strike first, but a stray pass close to the Warrington line was picked off superbly by Matty Ashton. Ashton, one of the fastest players in the competition, raced the length of the field in the blink of an eye to put the Wolves in front, perhaps slightly against the run of play to that point. But that early try firmly shifted the momentum in Warrington’s favour, and there was little argument when they doubled their lead as the midway point in the half approached. Their second came whe Widdop and Williams linked up to devastating effect, with Widdop sending Williams across and giving Stefan Ratchford the simplest of conversions to make it 12-0. Castleford, to their credit, showed plenty of endeavour in response. And they will have perhaps felt aggrieved they didn’t reduce the deficit when Kenny Edwards broke free of a tackle to touch down. Edwards, however, was adjudged to have made a double movement in the act of scoring: though the replays were far from conclusive in supporting James Child’s decision. Castleford’s potency then deserted them at crucial moments. After earning a penalty, Jordan Turner was held up before a poor kick from Jake Trueman three tackles later saw another opportunity go to waste. More chances came and went for the visitors and you felt that if Warrington scored first after half-time, the Tigers’ profligacy would come back to haunt them. But fortunately for the travelling support from West Yorkshire, they were given a moment to cheer shortly after the restart. Castleford finally made some territory count when, after an instinctive ball steal from Liam Watts, Niall Evalds provided an inch-perfect pass for Derrell Olpherts to cross. Gareth O’Brien, however, skewed the conversion, meaning Warrington remained eight points ahead. However, within three minutes, that lead had been extended once again. Warrington’s third try came when Ratchford’s pass enabled Josh Charnley to score the 250th try of his career, and as the hour mark approached, the hosts struck a potentially telling blow when Williams sent Robbie Mulhern through a gap in the Castleford defence. The forward showed an impressive turn of pace to not only break the line, but outpace Evalds and dive across, giving Ratchford the simplest of conversions. Suddenly, the hosts led by 18. And if Castleford’s chances were slim at that point, they were firmly extinguished on the hour mark with a bizarre try the visitors gifted the Wolves. A routine carry from deep was fumbled by Bureta Faraimo and former Tigers centre Peter Mata’utia reacted quickest, hacking on towards the line and winning the race to ground the ball and compound his former side’s misery. With the game beyond them, Castleford at least claimed a consolation try via Trueman but six minutes later, Warrington responded with another try, this time when Charnley’s acrobatic leap saw him claim his second and put further daylight between the sides which, on the balance of play, few could argue with.

2/18/2022,"Super Rugby has set its sights on the vast, blue horizon of the Pacific Ocean in an attempt to reinvent and re-energise the elite southern hemisphere competition and for the first time in its 26-year history the competition will feature two Pacific Island teams – the Fijian Drua and Moana Pasifika – along with sides from Australia and New Zealand. Many would argue that these inclusions are long overdue given the Pacific Islands’ enormous contribution to the game globally, particularly Super Rugby. Without professional domestic competitions, the major rugby-playing nations of Fiji, Samoa and Tonga became nurseries for rich clubs in Australasia, Europe and Japan.  Some of the most exciting players in Super Rugby history, such as Fijian winger Rupeni Caucaunibuca, were Pacific Islanders, while the team lists of Australian and Kiwi sides over the years have included a host of players of Pacific Island heritage. On that basis, it is only fair that they should be given a place at the table, but their inclusion was not just an act of altruism on the part of Australian and New Zealand administrators, who will be banking on them to give the competition a shot in the arm. The Pacific Islanders are renowned for their flamboyant style of play and they have the potential to become the entertainers of the competition. The inclusion of the Fijian Drua and Moana Pasifika will also provide Super Rugby with more variety. The competition started with 12 teams involving sides from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, but expanded to an 18-team format with the addition of extra teams in Australia, Argentina and Japan. With the departure of South Africa and the advent of Covid-19, Super Rugby devolved into two separate Australian and New Zealand domestic competitions as well as a lopsided trans-Tasman event. Officials will be hoping the two Pacific Island teams will restore an international flavour to the competition. But the inclusion of the Pacific island sides does not come without risk. Apart from a few ex-Wallabies such as Sekope Kepu and Christian Lealiifano, most of the names in the Fijian Drua and Moana Pasifika sides would be unfamiliar to Australian rugby fans. The majority of the best Pacific Island players play in Europe, which has raised concerns about the competitiveness of the two new Super Rugby sides. The last thing needed are another two uncompetitive teams, given there are already enough problems with the Kiwis dominating the Australian sides. Moana Pasifika’s intended Super Rugby debut against the Blues in Auckland on Friday evening has been postponed because of a Covid-19 outbreak among the players, which means the Fijian Drua will be the history-makers when they play the NSW Waratahs in Parramatta. The match will be as much of a test for the Waratahs as it will be for the Fijians. The Waratahs, the last Australian team to lift the Super Rugby title in 2014, finished last in both the domestic Super Rugby AU and Trans-Tasman competitions last year. The men in sky blue are looking forward to a revival under new coach Darren Coleman, who developed a reputation as a coach who could turn struggling teams around in Sydney club rugby. Like former Waratahs coach Michael Cheika, one of Coleman’s greatest strengths is his ability to recruit players. This year’s Waratahs squad looks fairly similar to last season’s, but there are a few interesting new faces such as former Wales and Lions centre Jamie Roberts, who will add experience and maturity to a young side. Coleman has a three-year plan to revitalise the the team, although they should be significantly better than recent seasons, which is important for the team representing Australia’s biggest rugby population. The Queensland Reds and the Brumbies will be expected to be Australia’s flag-bearers once again this year. The Reds won the Super AU competition last year, while the Brumbies were the highest Australian place-getters in the Trans-Tasman competition. The Melbourne Rebels and Western Force usurped the Waratahs last year, but getting past the Brumbies and the Reds will be a much more difficult task. But it is how the Australian teams perform against the New Zealanders that will be the ultimate test. As a result of New Zealand’s strict Covid-19 border rules, the Super Rugby draw has been revamped so the Australian sides will play their local derbies early and take on the Kiwis later in the season. There is certainly a feel-good factor when Australian teams win local derbies, but the Aussie sides must continue to close the gap with the Kiwis to achieve a real measure of success. Last year the Chiefs were the fifth-best New Zealand team in the Trans-Tasman competition with 19 points on the table, while the sixth-placed Brumbies were the highest-ranked Australian side with just five points, edging the Reds on percentages. Even if all five Australian teams beat the Fijian Drua and Moana Pasifika, it will not count for much if they cannot defeat the Kiwis. The Australian sides beating the New Zealanders is the only thing that will put the super back into rugby.",Sport/Sport,Super Rugby turns to Pacific for much-needed shot in the arm in 2022 season | Bret Harris,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/18/super-rugby-turns-to-pacific-for-much-needed-shot-in-the-arm-in-2022-season
2/18/2022,"The calm between Storm Dudley and Storm Eunice allowed England to open their challenge for the inaugural Arnold Clark Cup but saw them concede their first goal in seven games under Sarina Wiegman’s management. Yet if a draw secured as much by Kadeisha Buchanan’s excellence at the heart of Canada’s defence as Janine Beckie’s sumptuous equaliser slightly disappointed the 8,769 who braved the bitter evening chill, Lauren Hemp’s immense attacking promised offered cause for cautious optimism ahead of this summer’s European Championship.  It was England’s first game since November’s astonishing 20-0 win against Latvia but Canada’s reigning Olympic gold medallists represented a very different proposition. Moreover Bev Priestman arrived equipped with invaluable inside knowledge about Sarina Wiegman’s players and their foibles. Canada’s manager knows many of the Lionesses very well after serving as number two to Phil Neville and playing a key role in the team’s run to the 2019 World Cup semi-finals in France. Indeed the Consett-born coach had been under the distinct impression she would succeed Neville and has admitted to feeling more than a little disappointed when she was overlooked for the England job. After leading the Netherlands to Euro 2017 glory Wiegman perhaps seemed the safer option but Priestman swiftly proved her worth by dusting herself down, moving to Vancouver and choreographing that Olympic triumph in Japan. Such recent history dictated that this was a match both women seemed particularly keen to win and, at kick-off, England’s record of six straight wins under Wiegman, with 53 goals scored and none conceded, appeared under severe threat. It was an impression confirmed as Canada’s first corner resulted in considerable confusion among the home defence, permitting Kadeisha Buchanan a free header which was somehow scrambled to safety. Yet if Priestman’s team looked organised and efficient England ultimately dominating the opening half, enjoying some extremely bright attacking moments, most notably those involving Lauren Hemp. The Manchester City winger’s rapid change of pace and wonderful tight control ensured that Jayde Riviere, Canada’s right-back, was frequently stretched to the limit and even a central defender of Buchanan’s class had her work cut outside whenever Hemp cut inside. Shortly after Hemp had conjured a shooting chance sent whizzing fractionally wide by Leah Williamson – captaining England from an anchoring central midfield berth alongside Keira Walsh – Wiegman’s side scored. When the fallout from Fran Kirby’s short corner resulted in Canada’s goalkeeper Kaitlyn Sheridan punching a cross clear it dropped for Millie Bright to unleash a glorious, technically assured volley which was already travelling inexorably towards the back of the net when, deep in the six-yard box, it deflected off Jordyn Huitema. As befits a centre-half, Chelsea’s Bright is not a prolific scorer but she has always been capable of pulling off an odd eye catching finish and this proved a case in point. More generally England had begun suggesting that their improvement under Wiegman is real and they are not merely flat track bullies. Tricky tests against Spain and Germany – who drew 1-1 on Thursday afternoon at the Riverside – lie ahead in the coming days but the early evidence here was encouraging. Tellingly, with Hemp and Kirby persistently ruffling Canadian composure, Mary Earps was not required to make a single first half save. Yet, perhaps inevitably, caveats remained. For all the sharpness and slickness of England’s possession game and despite their interspersing of one and two touch short passing cameos with Hemp’s willingness to run at Priestman’s backline, Sheridan was not overly exerted either. It might have been different had Buchanan not made a couple of vital blocks and Hemp not directed a decent chance wide but Alessia Russo, Wiegman’s centre-forward for the night, hardly placed the benched Ellen White’s European Championship place under real threat. Such nagging doubts were realised as England conceded a goal for the first time on Wiegman’s watch. Involving a cleverly incisive interchange between Ashley Lawrence, Huitema and Beckie, it concluded with the last of this trio putting some Manchester City teammates on the opposition in their place by taking a steadying touch and sending a rising shot curving over Earps from the edge of the area. As good as Beckie’s goal undeniably was it will not have been lost on Wiegman that it stemmed from a cheap concession of possession in midfield. It was time for Lucy Bronze to step off the bench and make her first appearance under the Dutchwoman after knee surgery but as Buchanan continued to frustrate them England lost both concentration and control.",Sport/Football,Janine Beckie’s strike for Canada ends Wiegman’s perfect England record,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/17/england-canada-arnold-clark-cup-match-report
2/18/2022,"Donald Trump and two of his children have been ordered by a New York judge to appear for a deposition within the next three weeks, as part of the billowing investigation over alleged fraud in the valuation of assets belonging to his family business. The ruling by Judge Arthur Engoron to force Trump and his two eldest children – Donald Jr and Ivanka – to comply with subpoenas amounts to a sharp escalation of the legal perils that are rapidly tightening around the former president.  The family has been striving to fend off demands for documents, information and testimony from the New York state attorney general, Letitia James. She is investigating whether the Trump Organization used “fraudulent or misleading” valuations of its assets to attract loans and reduce its tax burden. Following a two-hour hearing on Thursday, Engoron delivered a blunt rebuttal to arguments put forward by Trump lawyers that the former president should not be subjected to questioning in the civil case because the information could be used against him in criminal proceedings that are running in parallel. The judge went so far as to say that had James not subpoenaed them, it would have been “a blatant dereliction of duty”. Responding to the news, James said that it showed that “no one will be permitted to stand in the way of the pursuit of justice, no matter how powerful they are”. Under the judge’s ruling, Trump must now testify within 21 days and hand over “documents and information” within 14 days. The development is the second severe blow for the former president in the space of a week. On Monday, it was revealed that the longtime accounting firm for the Trump Organization, Mazars USA, had broken off ties with the family business, saying that it could no longer stand by 10 years of annual financial statements that it had prepared for the group. The accountants said that they had reviewed the “totality of the circumstances” and reached the conclusion that “we are not able to provide any new work product” to the Trumps. Now Trump and his two children must face questioning by James, New York state’s top prosecutor who has relentlessly pursued alleged irregularities in the family’s finances. The event is likely to present the former president with a legal and political conundrum. Should he answer James’s piercing questions, he risks potentially implicating himself in a criminal investigation into Trump accounts that is being conducted by James in tandem with the Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg. If he pleads the fifth amendment and remains silent that could also be difficult for him. In legal arguments before Engoron delivered his decision, lawyers for Trump argued that he could not feasibly plead the fifth without hurting his potential criminal defense. “If he goes in and follows my advice, which will be you cannot answer these questions without … immunity because that’s what the law provides, and take the fifth amendment, that’ll be on every front page in the newspaper in the world. And how can I possibly pick a jury in that case?” said Ronald Fischetti, Trump’s criminal defense lawyer. Politically, the deposition is also likely to be awkward. In the past, Trump has poured scorn on those who remain silent under questioning. During his 2016 presidential election campaign, he ridiculed the practice, saying “the mob takes the fifth. If you’re innocent, why are you taking the fifth amendment?” Michael Cohen, an ex-vice president of the Trump Organization, said the issue raised problems for his former boss. “Let’s not forget Trump’s declaration that only guilty people plead the fifth. I wonder if that applies to him and his children as and when they remain silent,” Cohen told the Guardian in response to Engoron’s ruling. The judge referred to Cohen in his decision, pointing out that it was the testimony of Trump’s former personal lawyer before the House oversight committee in February 2019, in which Cohen accused Trump of “cooking the books”, that triggered the James investigation in the first place. Cohen, who spent three years in prison himself for fraud and other offences, told the Guardian that it was “only in Trump’s delusional world that law enforcement should not be permitted to depose him and members of his family. Their concerns stem from their inability to tell the truth and risk additional perjury charges.” Trump has consistently denounced the investigation by James, who is a Democrat, as a partisan witch-hunt. On Tuesday he slammed the investigation yet again, calling it a “sham investigation of a great company that has done a spectacular job for New York and beyond”. Such an aggressive posture has worked for Trump over the years in staring down many of the legal challenges brought against him. But in this case, Thursday’s ruling is likely to put new wind into the sails of the James investigation and make an easy get-out clause less likely. The James investigation, combined with its criminal Manhattan equivalent, are now top of the league of a plethora of legal troubles facing the former occupant of the White House. A Guardian tally this month found that Trump was facing a total of 19 legal challenges, six of which involve alleged financial irregularities.",News/US news,"Trump and two eldest children must testify in New York case, judge rules",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/17/donald-trump-children-testify-new-york-fraud-investigation
2/18/2022,"A ban on junk food advertising by Transport for London has contributed to a 1,000 calorie decrease in unhealthy purchases in people’s weekly shopping, a study has estimated. The biggest effects were seen for chocolate and confectionery with an almost 20% decrease, or 317.9 calories, in average weekly household purchases of energy from these products.  The decrease works out to be about 385 calories a person a week, equivalent to every Londoner in the study buying about 1.5 fewer standard-size bars of milk chocolate each week. Researchers led by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) compared almost two million weekly grocery purchases of products high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) by households in London and the north of England between June 2018 and December 2019. Researchers found the policy was associated with an estimated 1,001 calorie (6.7%) decrease in average weekly household purchases of energy from HFSS products compared with what would have happened without the policy. Dr Amy Yau, from LSHTM and the study’s lead author, said: “Many governments and local authorities are considering advertising restrictions to reduce consumption of HFSS products as part of obesity prevention strategies. “However, evidence of the effectiveness of such policies, especially away from broadcast media, is scarce. “Our study helps to plug that knowledge gap, showing TfL’s policy is a potential destination for decision-makers aiming to reduce diet-related disease more widely.” The team also found some limited indications that the effect of the ban was larger in households with individuals living with obesity. TfL’s ban on advertising HFSS products, which began in 2019, encompasses the underground, overground, buses, Docklands Light Railway, taxis and on some roadside advertising sites such as roundabouts and bus stops. London mayor Sadiq Khan said: “I am pleased to see the positive impact these groundbreaking measures have had, leading to a real reduction in the amount of junk food being purchased.” Barbara Crowther, coordinator of the Children’s Food Campaign, said: “We’re delighted to see that TfL’s healthier food advertising policy is working as intended and is helping to stem the tide of junk food advertising that constantly nudges us towards less healthy options.” Britain has one of the highest obesity rates in Europe with two in three adults overweight or obese and the NHS spending £6bn a year treating obesity-related ill-health. In December, the government announced plans to introduce a 9pm watershed on TV and a ban on paid-for advertising online for unhealthy food and drink, plus new restrictions on the promotion of unhealthy food and drink in retail outlets and online. However, a report commissioned by the government’s own obesity research unit warned that these efforts will fail unless much wider action is urgently taken to transform the entire food environment.",News/Society,TfL junk food ad ban has helped Londoners shop more healthily – study,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/17/tfl-junk-food-ad-ban-has-helped-londoners-shop-more-healthily-study
