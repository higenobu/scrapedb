3/13/2022,"Chances to make Test centuries don’t come around very often. Excellent careers might include five or 10. Each innings starts from nothing and gradually climbs across hours, with every rung gained being the one that might break. However placid the pitch, however rich the vein of form, it only takes one good ball, one mistake, one lapse of concentration, piece of bad luck, umpiring error, fine piece of fielding, and the count collapses back to zero. When Usman Khawaja gloved a catch at Pindi Stadium for 97 last week, the odds were against him getting another chance at a century in Pakistan. Best case the tour had two matches to come, and at the age of 35 he had no prospects of visiting again. If he had achieved the feat there would have been a simple and satisfying circularity to his story: born in Islamabad, where the first Test was played; growing up in Sydney, and became an Australian national cricketer; then at last a trip back to Pakistan to raise the bat in triumph in front of a crowd that would simultaneously be home and away. The joining of tides, the closing of the circle. This chapter of Khawaja’s story would also have been shot through with brighter and more complicated strands of meaning. A player from one of the migrant communities that make up so much of Australian local cricket but so little of the overwhelmingly white professional scene. In a Test team whose players of colour across 145 years barely tally a handful. A leading member of the first Australian side to visit Pakistan in since the last millennium, finally coming back. Of course a century is arbitrary, and it made no cricketing difference whether Khawaja got 97 or 100 in a yawning draw on a somnolent track. It made a difference though that he didn’t get that moment with the crowd, that moment of confused adulation from Pakistanis as one of their own who was also an Australian. The homecoming was not marked to its fullest possible extent. So it felt more special when the opportunity rolled around again, in his very next hit. The second Test in Karachi, an even more fitting locale as the city where he spent his early childhood and where his extended family still lives. This time Khawaja was more cavalier to start, going after the bowling, hitting sixes and playing pull shots. But as the ball aged he reined himself in. He reached 97 again. And instead of looking for a boundary, he waited for a simple single to reach 98. Then 99, and finally that hundred, with a nondescript nudge square. The response from the stands was worth the wait. Enjoying Khawaja’s recent success has led some observers to overcorrect, believing now that he should have had been opening the batting for years. It’s worth remembering that until recently, despite being captain of Queensland, he batted elsewhere. When he was squeezed out of the team in England in 2019, it was reasonable to interpret that as a rough deal, but Steve Smith had to come back from injury and Marnus Labuschagne had excelled as Smith’s replacement. Both had scored in bulk that series. Khawaja had not. A new opener had just been installed who was untested. Khawaja was very tested. He had enjoyed nearly 10 years of opportunities in the team for a couple of major highs and a lot of stuff in the lower middle. He still has a dismal overseas record everywhere unless it’s against Pakistan or his two Tests in New Zealand. He was dropped in 2019 because he had made himself replaceable. He eventually made his way back in 2022 on the basis of consistent quality. That’s what he has offered since his return against England in Sydney: three hundreds, and very nearly four, in the space of four Tests. The twin tons at the SCG followed by this one. Perhaps this is a late-career awakening of his ability that will take him deep into his 30s. Perhaps it’s a flash in the pan that will be darkened very soon. It doesn’t really matter. For now, a career that had promised and shimmered and underwhelmed has now done something stronger, things that can’t be undone. The moment in Karachi was magic, but it was concrete at the same time.",Sport/Sport,Cavalier Usman Khawaja relishes magic moment in Karachi | Geoff Lemon,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/13/cavalier-usman-khawaja-relishes-magic-moment-in-karachi
3/13/2022,"The final instalment of this series opener in Antigua played out with a carnival atmosphere in the stands and commendable doggedness from both sides out in the middle until weary handshakes eventually arrived at 5.34pm local time. Over the course of five days, on a largely lifeless surface, the players had given their all. And in the end, West Indies had the cool heads of Nkrumah Bonner (38) and Jason Holder (37) to thank, the pair holding firm for 144 minutes of defiance to take their side to 147 for four from 70.1 overs after England had set a target of 286. This was an unfamiliar territory for Joe Root’s tourists during their winter of discontent, with the captain’s 24th Test century – 109 from 204 balls – affording him the rare luxury of a declaration at 349 for six shortly before lunch. It felt bold at the time, not least after losing Mark Wood to the elbow injury that puts his tour in doubt. Jack Leach stood up for his captain here, claiming figures of three for 57 from 30.1 overs on the final day despite his main encouragement coming from the cage of catchers around the bat, rather than the surface. Ben Stokes was the standout seamer, notching up 13 overs of grunt work and 41 overall in a match where the all-rounder was supposed to be used sparingly. England were certainly in the ascendancy when Bonner and Holder came together after tea and West Indies had slipped to 67 for four. It came through a combination of Leach’s persistence, the muscle of Stokes, and a couple of shots that had head coach Phil Simmons rolling his eyes on the home team’s room balcony. Things had looked fairly benign out in the middle when Kraigg Brathwaite and John Campbell put on a 59-run partnership for the first wicket. Indeed it took a typical intervention from Stokes to separate them, the all-rounder pounding in from the Sir Andy Roberts end and pinning Brathwaite lbw for 33 with one that finally kept low. This breakthrough was then compounded instantly when Campbell decided to take on Leach next over, only to pick out Craig Overton at mid-on. As a brain fade it rivalled the subsequent dismissal of his fellow Jamaican Jermaine Blackwood, when the No 5 played an awful swipe on two and was struck in front by Leach. In between came the loss of Shamarh Brooks on the stroke of tea when Leach found a smidgeon of turn, the edge of the right-hander’s bat and Zak Crawley pouched a fine low catch at slip. Having earlier grassed Campbell on one – and reprieved Bonner on 73 during his first innings century – his relief was palpable. A more diligent approach followed from Bonner and Holder, however, hunkering down for the second time in the match. England were patient and resourceful, even if Chris Woakes and Craig Overton were largely neutered and the loopy spin of Dan Lawrence threatened more. But they were also left to rue Root’s decision not to use his final review in the 49th over when Leach pinned Holder on the back foot offering no shot on 13 and Hawkeye returned three reds. When the England captain instead used this for a caught behind off Holder four overs later and snicko showed no spike, further agony followed. And so while England’s depleted attack surpassed the incredible energy levels of the local drummers on the grass bank, they hobbled off at the close with a tinge of regret. This final outcome was not entirely unexpected when, at 11.38am local time, Root leaned out of the dressing room window and waved in Jonny Bairstow and Woakes. The pair added a sprightly seventh-wicket stand of 35 that calmed the seas after England lost four wickets in five overs during their pursuit of quick runs. Root had earlier turned his overnight 84 into three figures, slotting six fours in a frictionless cruise and marking the milestone by kissing a necklace made by his children back home. He was also celebrating his 13th hundred as captain – surpassing the previous England record of 12 made by predecessor Alastair Cook – and a first since the end of last summer. He and Crawley had also put on 201 runs for the second wicket, the latter adding four runs to the 117 he had so elegantly stroked the previous day only for Holder to detonate his off-stump with a lasered yorker. Lawrence then played a little gem of an innings, injecting impetus into proceedings with a 36-ball 37 and perhaps auditioning for Strictly down the line, such was his footwork and timing. From 310 for three there was a wobble, Alzarri Joseph nipping in to claim three of the four middle order wickets to fall. But once the calm heads of Woakes and Bairstow had set up a satisfactory equation for their captain, it was over to Root’s bowlers to see if they could somehow force a positive result. That they were in this position, and had seen three batters in Bairstow, Crawley and Root make centuries during this hard-fought series opener, pointed to, if not a total reset, then some green shoots of recovery on the road.",Sport/Sport,West Indies dig in to force draw with England in first Test,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/12/west-indies-dig-in-to-force-draw-with-england-in-first-test
3/13/2022,"15 Freddie Steward Mopped up well at the back but met his match in Keenan. England could really have done with his aerial prowess. 6 14 Max Malins Had a hard time with Ireland always looking to release Lowe down his wing. 5 13 Joe Marchant Rose to the challenge and made numerous contributions in defence. This could be a coming of age performance. 8 12 Henry Slade Did not get the chance to offer much in attack but a robust performance in defence. He has had a consistent tournament. 6 11 Jack Nowell Maybe he is a ninth forward after all, playing his part in a scrum that was dominant. Defended well down his wing. 7 10 Marcus Smith Missed one penalty but was on target with the rest and kept Ireland’s defence honest. His high kicks also yielded reward. 6 9 Harry Randall Tried to make things happen with a few quick taps, though not really his game, and was no surprise to see Youngs. 6 1 Ellis Genge Had Furlong on toast at scrum time, which is not bad for someone who supposedly has wobbles there, and ran and tackled himself to standstill. 9 2 Jamie George His experience proved pivotal in settling England down after the Ewels dismissal. 8 3 Kyle Sinckler Had been hampered by back injury in buildup and never looked right but fought valiantly. 6 4 Maro Itoje Astonishing performance. Fired up during the anthems and led the rearguard once Ewels had gone off. Influence was obvious. 9 5 Charlie Ewels A red card after 82 seconds for a dangerous tackle on Ryan. Can have no complaints. 2 6 Courtney Lawes (capt) All his teammates talk about what a laid-back, calm captain he is and his cool head was key to keeping England in the game. 7 7 Tom Curry Compounded England’s woes when he went off with a hamstring injury after 15 minutes. 5 8 Sam Simmonds Got through plenty of work in defence, tackling his heart out. No opportunities to show what he can do in attack. 7 REPLACEMENTS Jamie Blamire (for George 80) N/A, Joe Marler (for Genge 67) Got stuck in 6, Will Stuart (for Sinckler 38) 7, Joe Launchbury (for Dombrandt 67) Peripheral 5, Alex Dombrandt (for Curry 15) Was later hooked 5, Ben Youngs (for Randall 52) 6, George Ford (for Stewart 80) N/A, Elliot Daly (for Marchant 70) N/A 15 Hugo Keenan Ran an unstoppable line for Ireland’s second try and composed under the high ball. A standout performer. 9 14 Andrew Conway Relatively quiet with ball in hand but on the money with two 50:22s. Reliable presence Ireland needed as match wore on. 7 13 Garry Ringrose Showed some lovely flashes but no more than that and would have hoped to find the ball in space more often than he did. 6 12 Bundee Aki His running can be such a threat – particularly when the opposition is a man light – but Ireland’s indiscipline limited his effect. 6 11 James Lowe Finished off the first try with England shellshocked. Gave away a few penalties but his power caused problems. 8 10 Johnny Sexton Tried trademark wrap-around move to exploit numerical advantage but main strength was his patience as England rallied. 7 9 Jamison Gibson-Park Quick-thinking led to Keenan’s try and showed moments of quality when it mattered. Has made the No 9 jersey his own. 9 1 Cian Healy Struggled against Sinckler at the scrum and taken off early. Not his afternoon and Ireland badly missed Andrew Porter. 3 2 Dan Sheehan A force to be reckoned with ball in hand and no complaints with his lineout work. Part of a front-row outgunned at the scrum. 7 3 Tadhg Furlong Repeatedly pinged at the scrum and could not make his usual impact in the loose. Kept plugging away though. 4 4 Tadhg Beirne Did not have his usual impact at the breakdown and was guilty of some handling errors at times. 6 5 James Ryan Lasted just over a minute before Ewels’ tackle ended his afternoon. Ireland missed his leadership thereafter. N/A 6 Peter O’Mahony Should have been more conspicuous than usual in his scrum cap but largely anonymous before he was hooked. 4 7 Josh van der Flier A lot of carries for not much reward due to England’s defence. Developing into one of the best openside flankers around. 8 8 Caelen Doris Had a try disallowed when bumping off Randall in comical fashion but ran down a few blind alleys in the second half. 6 REPLACEMENTS Rob Herring (for Sheehan 52) Solid 6; Dave Kilcoyne (for Healy 52) Struggled in scrum 5; Finlay Bealham (for Furlong 73) Try 7; Iain Henderson (for Ryan 2) Wore England down 7: Jack Conan (for O’Mahony 61) Try 7; Conor Murray (for Gibson Park 67) Experience 7; Joey Carbery (for Sexton 80) N/A; Robbie Henshaw (for Aki 65) Energy 6.",Sport/Sport,England 15-32 Ireland: Six Nations player ratings from Twickenham,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/12/england-15-32-ireland-six-nations-player-ratings-from-twickenham
3/13/2022,"Eddie Jones has questioned why Ireland were not shown a yellow card as a result of England’s scrum dominance in his side’s 32-15 loss but believes the gallant defeat – in which they played 78 minutes with 14 men – could be the making of their 2023 World Cup campaign. Jones had no complaints over Charlie Ewels’ second-minute red card and was full of pride for his side’s effort but believes Mathieu Raynal, the French referee, should have meted out stricter punishment to Ireland’s serial offenders at the scrum. Despite losing Ewels, England were level at 15-15 with seven minutes to go before late tries from Jack Conan and Finlay Bealham finally broke their resistance. In Ewels’ absence, Courtney Lawes shifted to second row at the scrum with Jack Nowell packing down at flanker but England comprehensively overpowered Ireland, earning six penalties. “I’m bit disappointed the referee didn’t allow us to scrum fully,” said Jones. “That would be my only complaint, that we weren’t allowed to play advantage away from the scrum – and there was no sign of a yellow card. If World Rugby want to have a scrum in the game they’ve got to allow strong scrums to allow themselves to dominate so we’re disappointed we didn’t get more out of it.” On Ewels’ second-minute dangerous tackle on James Ryan, who took no further part in the match, Jones added: “He’s disappointed but no one apportions blame on him. It’s a genuine attempt to make a good tackle, he just got his head in the wrong spot. We’ve got no questions about the red card.” Defeat means England are out of contention for the title and with a trip to grand slam-chasing France next week, Jones’s side could finish fifth in the table for the second year in a row. They are set to be without Tom Curry, who limped off with a hamstring injury, as well as Ewels who is facing a ban and potentially Kyle Sinckler, who went off with concussion. The brave manner of their defeat, however, means the inquest is on hold for now with Maro Itoje, Ellis Genge and Nowell all standout performers despite Ireland eventually claiming their biggest ever win at Twickenham. “I see that as a foundation game for us where we set our campaign for the World Cup in 2023,” added Jones. “The spirit, the determination, the ability to work through problems were all absolutely outstanding. This pack is only going to get better and better. We want to be an old-fashioned England pack and a new-fashioned England attack. We’re moving in a really solid progression towards that. There were 82,000 people there tonight that loved seeing the spirit of this team. It’s a great learning experience for this team, I couldn’t be prouder of them. We’ll be right. We don’t have a shortage of spirit. We’ll get ourselves right and rip into France.” Ireland, meanwhile, will be crowned champions if they overcome Scotland and England do them a favour in Paris. Andy Farrell’s side laboured at times with England, roared on by a raucous Twickenham crowd, threatening the most unlikely of victories but they wrapped up what could prove a key bonus point, which leaves them two points behind France in the table. “[I’m] over the moon,” said Farrell. “If you’d said that to us before the start we’d have snatched your hand off. I’m sure that England will recover well and take good heart from the great performance with 14 men and they’ll look to finish the tournament very well themselves.”",Sport/Sport,Jones says England’s spirit in defeat by Ireland can boost World Cup attempt,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/12/eddie-jones-claims-england-ireland-performance-in-defeat-could-be-making-of-world-cup-bid
