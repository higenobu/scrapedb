1/22/2022,"By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. government said on Friday it would suspend 44 China-bound flights from the United States by four Chinese carriers in response to the Chinese government's decision to suspend some U.S. carrier flights over COVID-19 concerns. The suspensions will begin on Jan. 30 with Xiamen Airlines’ scheduled Los Angeles-to-Xiamen flight and run through March 29, the Transportation Department said. The decision will cut some flights by Xiamen, Air China, China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines. Since Dec. 31, Chinese authorities have suspended 20 United Airlines, 10 American Airlines and 14 Delta Air Lines flights, after some passengers tested positive for COVID-19. As recently as Tuesday, the Transportation Department said the Chinese government had announced new U.S. flight cancellations. Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said Friday the policy for international passenger flights entering China has ""been applied equally to Chinese and foreign airlines in a fair, open and transparent way."" He called the U.S. move ""very unreasonable"" and added ""We urge the U.S. side to stop disrupting and restricting the normal passenger flights"" by Chinese airlines."" Airlines for America, a trade group representing the three U.S. carriers affected by China's move along with others, said it supported Washington's action ""to ensure the fair treatment of U.S. airlines in the Chinese market."" The Transportation Department said France and Germany have taken similar action against China’s COVID-19 actions. It said China's suspension of the 44 flights ""are adverse to the public interest and warrant proportionate remedial action."" It added that China's ""unilateral actions against the named U.S. carriers are inconsistent"" with a bilateral agreement. China has also suspended numerous U.S. flights by Chinese carriers after passengers later tested positive. The department said it was prepared to revisit its action if China revised its ""policies to bring about the necessary improved situation for U.S. carriers."" It warned that if China cancels more flights, ""we reserve the right to take additional action."" China has all but shut its borders to travelers, cutting total international flights to just 200 a week, or 2% of pre-pandemic levels, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said in September. The number of U.S. flights being scrapped has surged since December, as infections caused by the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus soared to record highs in the United States. Beijing and Washington have sparred over air services since the start of the pandemic. In August, the U.S. Transportation Department limited four flights from Chinese carriers to 40% passenger capacity for four weeks after Beijing imposed identical limits on four United Airlines flights. Before the recent cancellations, three U.S. airlines and four Chinese carriers were operating about 20 flights a week between the countries, well below the figure of more than 100 per week before the pandemic.

1/22/2022,"Germany is blocking Estonia from providing military support to Ukraine, The Wall Street Journal reports. Berlin won't provide permits necessary to export weapons of German origin. Germany has faced criticism in Washington amid the Ukraine crisis, particularly over Nord Stream 2. Germany is preventing fellow NATO member Estonia from providing Ukraine with military support by declining to offer export permits for weapons of German origin, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. ""Germany, they have a lot of hesitation to deliver to us,"" Ukraine's defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, told The Journal. A German government spokesperson explained to the outlet that the decision on the exportation of weaponry is a result of a long-standing policy. ""The principle governing arms exports is always the same—whether they come directly from Germany or from third countries—and no permission has been issued at this stage,"" the spokesperson said, adding that ""it is not possible to estimate the outcome of the process at this moment."" Estonia is lobbying for Germany to change course so that it can send Ukraine D-30 howitzers. The Soviet weapons were left in Germany after its reunification before being exported to Finland and later Estonia, The Wall Street Journal report said. Unlike other NATO members, including the US and UK, Germany has refused to provide weapons to Ukraine amid tensions with Russia. Over the past year alone, the US has provided more than $400 million in security assistance to Ukraine. Since 2014, the US has provided Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank missiles, small arms and ammunition, and patrol boats, among other equipment. But the German government has opposed sending weapons to Ukraine to avoid provoking Russia, while also citing Germany's own history of atrocities in the region under the Nazis during World War II. ""Our restrictive position is well known and is rooted in history,"" Germany's foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said while visiting Kyiv this week. Ukraine has urged Germany to alter its policy, pushing back against its justifications for declining lethal aid. ""This responsibility should apply to the Ukrainian people, who lost at least 8 million lives during the Nazi occupation of Ukraine,"" Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, told the DPA news agency, according to Deutsche Welle. Russia in recent months has gathered tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine's borders, raising alarm across Europe about the prospect of an invasion. The White House earlier this week said that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could be imminent, and the Biden administration has warned Moscow it will face severe economic consequences in the event of an invasion. The Kremlin has said Russia has no plans to invade Ukraine while making demands for binding security guarantees that the US and NATO have dismissed as non-starters. Russia, among other things, has insisted that Ukraine and Georgia be barred from ever joining NATO. The alliance has been adamant that its open door policy is not up for negotiation. Ukraine has sought to join NATO for years and maintains a robust partnership with the alliance despite not being a member. This has angered Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has blamed NATO for the contentious dynamic between Moscow and the West. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Berlin on Wednesday that it is ""absurd"" to point the finger at NATO, citing Putin's history of aggression in the region. Russia in 2014 invaded and annexed Crimea from Ukraine. Since that year, the Kremlin has supported separatists in a war against Ukrainian forces in the eastern Donbass region. Diplomatic efforts to prevent a conflict have not led to any major breakthroughs so far. But Blinken met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva on Friday, and they both agreed that it was important to continue diplomatic talks. As the US searches for a peaceful resolution to the crisis, Germany has been the target of criticism in Washington. Some Republican lawmakers have effectively accused Berlin of abandoning Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. Nord Stream 2, a Russia-to-Germany gas pipeline, has landed at the center of this discussion. The pipeline, which is completed but not operational (pending German approval), is opposed by congressional lawmakers on both sides of the aisle as well as the Ukrainian government. The undersea pipeline bypasses Ukraine. Opponents contend the pipeline would give Russia dangerous leverage over Europe, while depriving Ukraine of billions in gas transit fees. The Biden administration has pushed back against sanctions on the pipeline in order to stay on Berlin's good side but has also urged Germany to halt Nord Stream 2 should Russia invade Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has signaled that he is open to this, but he has not explicitly stated that the pipeline would be scrapped as part of a response to a military incursion. Scholz on Tuesday said it is ""clear that there will be a high price to pay and that everything will have to be discussed should there be a military intervention in Ukraine.""

 Bill Maher is pushing back against blindly following the advice of Anthony Fauci and other doctors amid the coronavirus pandemic, saying, ""Don't sit there in your white coat and tell me 'just do what we say.'"" ""That's not a criticism of them like they're being corrupt, although there certainly is plenty of corruption in the medical establishment,"" the ""Real Time"" host said in an interview with Deadline published Friday, when asked if he believes Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease doctor ,or the medical establishment ""really know what they are doing."" ""But I've always maintained that the big overarching theme should be that people look back and say, 'Oh, look how far we've come medically.' Yes, that's true. We're not putting wooden teeth in our mouth like in the George Washington era, and of course we have antibiotics and lots of vaccines and lots of other things that have been miraculous. But in general, we still don't understand too much about how the human body works,"" Maher said. The medical community, the controversial HBO host said, has been wrong ""a lot"" throughout history. ""They drilled mercury into my teeth when I was a child. Now, of course, we don't do that anymore, but do you really think in 50 years people will look back and say, 'Oh, yeah, we had it all figured out in 2022'? No, they will be appalled at things we're doing right now."" Despite the country seeing more than 860,000 deaths from COVID-19 since 2020, Maher said he was ""never scared"" of the pandemic. ""I was always scared of the reaction to it, and as this has played out that only proved to be more true for me,"" he told Deadline. ""It was never that virulent a threat, I thought, to people who were in good health,"" he continued. ""Now, some people can't help that they're not in good health. We should, of course, protect the vulnerable, but it was mostly a disease of the very old, which every disease is a threat to, and people who have comorbidities, which mostly is due to lifestyle."" Of vaccines, Maher - who tested positive for COVID-19 last May - said, ""They just prevent you from dying, which is a great part of it, let's not undercount that. But if they don't prevent you from transmitting it and they don't prevent you from getting it why are we still treating this disease the way we always have?"" COVID-19 has been known to lead to serious illness and death even in younger and middle-aged adults who are otherwise healthy, and studies have shown - and most public health experts agree - that vaccinations greatly reduce the chances of being hospitalized or dying from the coronavirus. The comedian sounded off on Democrats and Republicans alike in the interview. Maher said the country is much different than it was when ""Real Time"" first premiered in 2003. ""I think the politics around me have changed. In other words, the first years George W. Bush was president and the liberal half of the country was, I thought, pretty sane. Now, since about I don't know 2015 or so there's been a real sea change in what's going on, on the left."" Maher knocked Democrats as ""the party of no common sense,"" saying they have ""inverted so much of traditional liberalism."" But Maher also took aim at Republicans echoing former President Trump's baseless claim that he was the actual winner of the 2020 election. A December poll from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst found that nearly three-quarters of Republicans doubted that President Biden's election victory was legitimate. ""Now I always will maintain that the right is the more dangerous faction in this country, especially since they don't believe in elections - I mean you have to keep that in perspective,"" Maher, 66, said. ""One side does not believe in the form of government we have. What do you do about people who are in the government who don't believe in your form of government?"" Calling the peaceful transfer of power the ""feather in our cap as America,"" Maher said, ""And now these people on the right have broken that and God knows what's going to happen in the future."" Maher also offered a bleak prediction for the future, saying ""the real day of reckoning is going to be between Election Day 2024 and Inauguration Day 2025, because that's when the rubber really hits the road."" Asserting that Trump will ""definitely be running"" and will become the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, Maher said that similar to 2020, the ex-president will refuse to concede. ""But this next time, he's going to have people in place who will back him up on his lie that he won the election whether he did or not. And then what do you do when those people are much more powerful and there are two claimants to the throne?"" ""I mean, we've seen this play out in other countries and it's not pretty,"" Maher said. ""And I don't know what will happen, but it frightens me a great deal."" -Nathaniel Weixel contributed.",Politics/The Hill,"Bill Maher pushes back on Fauci: 'Don't sit there in your white coat and tell me ""just do what we say""'",https://news.yahoo.com/bill-maher-pushes-back-fauci-223119173.html
1/22/2022,"Jan 21 (Reuters) - NATO rejected on Friday Russian demands to withdraw its forces from Romania and Bulgaria as diplomatic efforts continued to prevent a war in Europe after Russia massed tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine's borders. ""NATO will not renounce our ability to protect and defend each other, including with the presence of troops in the eastern part of the alliance,"" NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu said in a statement. Moscow has demanded legally binding guarantees from NATO that the bloc will stop its expansion and return to its 1997 borders. Earlier on Friday, the Russian foreign ministry said the security guarantees that Moscow seeks from the West include provisions requiring NATO forces to leave Romania and Bulgaria. Replying to a question about what that would mean for Bulgaria and Romania, which joined NATO after 1997, the ministry said Russia wanted all foreign troops, weapons and other military hardware withdrawn from those countries. NATO rebuffed these demands, saying they would create first and second class NATO members, which the alliance could not accept. ""We reject any idea of spheres of influence in Europe. We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment, including through strengthening our collective defence,"" the NATO spokesperson said. ""NATO is vigilant and continues to assess the need to reinforce the eastern part of our Alliance.""
