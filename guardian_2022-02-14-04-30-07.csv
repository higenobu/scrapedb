2/14/2022,"The rightwing French presidential candidate Valérie Pécresse vowed to crack down on immigration as she held her first big rally on Sunday amid competition from the growing far right and defections from her party to the centrist leader Emmanuel Macron. “There is no sovereignty without borders,” Pécresse said on stage in Paris as more than 6,000 people waved French flags in support of the first female presidential candidate for Les Républicains, the traditional rightwing party of Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy.  Pécresse, who on a recent trip to Greek migrant camps said she was not against “barbed wire” to keep migrants out of Europe, told the rally that she would support the building of barriers and “even walls” on the edge of Europe if the countries on the frontline wanted it. It was a clear reference to her rival, the controversial, far-right TV pundit Éric Zemmour, who this week suggested building a Donald Trump-style anti-immigration “wall” around the edges of the EU. A former budget minister under Sarkozy, Pécresse, 54, wants to be seen as the only feasible rival to Macron ahead of the April election. But she faces the serious challenge of whether she can make it to the second round runoff. The far right has risen in force to represent about 30% of the vote in current polls, and is split between two candidates, Marine Le Pen, running for the third time, and the newcomer Zemmour. Both are hovering around the same score as Pécresse in the polls. At the rally, Pécresse cited her heroes, Britain’s Margaret Thatcher and Germany’s Angela Merkel, as “women who always defended their people”, saying she wanted to create a “New France” of law and order, with tight controls on immigration and quotas for migrants. She said she would also oppose what she termed woke movements, which she said threatened to “demolish French identity”, tellling the rally that as leader of the Île-de-France region, which includes Paris and its surrounding area, she had banned “burkinis” or full-body swimsuits, from pools. To cheers from the hall, she said: “For me, the headscarf is not a piece of clothing like any other. It’s not a religious prescription. It’s a sign of the submission of a woman.” She criticised Macron’s government for refusing to ban the Muslim headscarf from competitive sports. Pécresse repeated her promise that “the salaries of French people will increase by 10% during my presidency”, and said she would decentralise France, attacking Macron for a top-down leadership style and high public spending, which she said had tipped France into dangerous debt. A fluent Russian-speaker, Pécresse delved into international affairs, saying that under Macron, France had been “humiliated” on the international scene, including over the Aukus defence agreement between Australia, the US and the UK. While Macron is at 24% in the first round, according to the latest Cevipof poll for Le Monde, Pécresse is at 15.5%, with Le Pen at 15% and Zemmour at 14.5%. Without naming Zemmour or Le Pen, Pécresse told the crowd: “The extremists are lying to you. Refuse the venom of their nostalgia. Don’t let anger and fear win.” Pécresse is under pressure from her party to pull ahead of her far-right rivals in the polls just as president Macron is expected to declare his re-election bid this month. But she suffered a blow this week on immigration when Natacha Bouchart, the rightwing mayor of Calais, broke ranks and announced she would support Macron for the presidential race. Bouchart is an outspoken critic of the situation of migrants wanting to reach Britain from the northern French coast on small boats. Bouchart said Macron had “listened attentively” to the problems of Calais and increased government involvement. She said she was supporting Macron “in the general interest of Calais”. Pécresse has failed to dominate the political debate with her policy ideas, in part because she is seen as attempting to cover all ideological bases in a divided party. She is seen as hailing from the moderate, centrist wing of the right, which Macron himself has won over by appointing two rightwing prime ministers. But Pécresse is also veering very hard right to win over the increasingly anti-immigration line on French national identity in her own party. Pollsters say her messaging to voters is not always clear. Chloé Morin, a political analyst who interviewed Pécresse on her communication style for a new book, We Get The Politicians We Deserve, said the rightwing candidate had been accused of appearing too studious and lacking spontaneity on screen. But Pécresse has criticised those who “act” in front of the cameras. Morin added: “Today, part of Pécresse’s space is occupied by Emmanuel Macron, who has the advantage of being the president in office … he has stifled her ground on the economy. And on the other side, she’s facing serious competition from Éric Zemmour and Marine Le Pen, who have the advantage of being in a more populist register of one-upmanship and can make themselves more audible in a media world that values clashes and buzz. They are more audible than Pécresse, who has to be more measured.” Meanwhile, Le Pen and Zemmour continued their own vicious battle to win far-right voters, with another defection from Le Pen’s National Rally party. Stéphane Ravier, Le Pen’s only senator, jumped ship to Zemmour saying he was best able to “unite” the far right.",News/World news,Valérie Pécresse rally focuses on immigration as threat from rivals grows,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/13/valerie-pecresse-rally-focuses-on-immigration-as-threat-from-rivals-grows
2/14/2022,"Craig Dawson took advantage of Leicester City’s habitual inability to defend set-pieces by heading in the stoppage-time equaliser that enabled West Ham United to capitalise on their rivals’ slips and move one point ahead in the battle for the final Champions League qualification place. With Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur faltering again, West Ham consolidated fourth place in the Premier League with what was a welcome point considering Leicester had battled back from going behind to Jarrad Bowen’s goal to lead 2-1.  Youri Tieleman’s penalty just before half-time and Ricardo Pereira’s first goal in more than two years, which also came against West Ham, appeared to have helped Leicester to a much-needed morale-booster before they gave up a winning position for the third time in successive home league games this year. Leicester have now conceded from 11 corners in the Premier League, the worst record in the division, and despite a much-improved performance, Brendan Rodgers remains a manager whose future – or at least his team – looks uncertain. Jarrad Bowen, who had given West Ham their lead, swung over the corner from which Dawson rose to head in the equaliser. West Ham have been less impressive on the road recently, having lost four of their previous seven Premier League away games, but this will go down as a welcome point. Kurt Zouma withdrew through illness shortly before the game but quite how such a straightforward clipped pass from Issa Diop, Zouma’s replacement, could bypass all of Leicester’s defence in the 120th minute and allow Bowen a clear run down the inside-left channel beggars belief. West Ham’s go-to man showed no hesitation whatsoever as he shot across Kasper Schmeichel from the left corner of the penalty area into the far bottom corner for his seventh goal in as many games, all told. Bowen, the matchwinner against Watford on Tuesday, has been involved in 15 goals in his 25 Premier League games this season and his movement from the centre circle to the inside-left channel was enough to beguile Leicester. The home team at this stage were diffident, conscious perhaps of all the negativity that comes with a run of six defeats in 12 games, especially the previous Sunday’s FA Cup humbling by Nottingham Forest. That had led Rodgers to castigate his players for their lack of hunger and to drop some of his bigger names such as Youri Tielemans, Harvey Barnes and Caglar Soyuncu for Thursday’s 2-0 defeat at Liverpool. Here they were all recalled but Leicester’s winter of discontent, with Jamie Vardy, Wes Fofana and Jonny Evans still among those injured, took another icy blow when James Justin, who has been so impressive since returning from 11 months out with a serious knee injury, fell to ground and had to be replaced, by Luke Thomas. James Maddison, playing in a more advanced wide role as Rodgers endeavoured to stiffen up his midfield, put in a couple of meaty challenges as he attempted to help Leicester battle their way back into the game. There was a shot wide from Tielemans, six minutes before half-time, and then Barnes cut inside to swerve a better effort not too far over the angle as West Ham’s proud fans were finally quietened by their home counterparts. With the crowd willing them on, Leicester regained a foothold in the game when Maddison’s corner struck Aaron Cresswell’s outstretched elbow and Tielemans slammed in the ensuing penalty to his usual side – the goalkeeper’s right – and offered the sign of a love-heart to the fans. Cresswell could have made amends in first-half stoppage time from Pablo Fornals’ pull-back from the left but the full-back did not catch his shot right from 12 yards. Bowen had an equally good chance five minutes after the restart but could not apply his usual clean contact at the edge of the six-yard box. The atmosphere cranked up as the rain teemed down and when Barnes went slaloming past Vladimir Coufal and crossed low to the far post, Patson Daka came sliding in to miss the converting contact by inches. Finally the Foxes had their tails up again and they took the lead 12 minutes into the second half. Tielemans switched play from the right to Barnes on the far side of the penalty area and the winger’s cross invited Ricardo Pereira, on his first league start for three months after a gradual rehabilitation from a broken leg, to climb above Cresswell and head in to the top corner. David Moyes introduced Sasid Benrahma and Nikola Vlasic for the final stages as West Ham attempted to refind their rhythm and three shots from the former helped turn the tide, the last one earning the corner that led to the equaliser.",Sport/Football,Craig Dawson saves the day for West Ham with late leveller at Leicester,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/13/leicester-west-ham-premier-league-match-report
2/14/2022,"Dozens of western diplomats in Kyiv were packing their bags and preparing to leave the city on Sunday evening, as many countries issued a clear warning to all citizens still inside Ukraine: get out now. Six months after western decision-makers were taken by surprise by the speed with which Kabul fell to the Taliban, politicians in many countries are taking extra precautions over a potential Russian assault that has not yet begun.  Governments of 39 countries have warned against travel to Ukraine, according to a count by the Ukrainian news site Novoe Vremya. Many have also warned that if people do not leave now, they may find it impossible to escape later, amid rumours that Ukrainian airspace could be closed in the coming days. The US, which has briefed that a full-blown Russian assault on Ukraine could be imminent, has said it is evacuating all but a small group of diplomats from Ukraine, and has reiterated warnings to US citizens that they should leave as soon as possible. “It isn’t just time to leave Ukraine, it is past time to leave Ukraine,” a senior US administration official said on Saturday. Britain and Germany have also advised their citizens to leave the country immediately. One of the most significant steps is the decision of Britain, Canada and the US to withdraw its staff from a monitoring mission in the eastern Ukraine conflict zone, run by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), at a time when western intelligence claims Russia may be preparing a “false flag” incident in the region. The US and Canadian embassies have sent non-essential staff and family members home and are evacuating others to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. American, Canadian and British military trainers in the country have also been withdrawn. Office space and hotel rooms in Lviv are at a premium as diplomats and businesses temporarily relocate there. Britain’s ambassador, Melinda Simmons, will stay in Kyiv and work with a core team, while other British diplomats have been sent home. US citizens in Ukraine said they have received calls from the state department warning them to leave as soon as possible. “It wasn’t an order but it was very strong advice,” said Joseph Davis, a US citizen based in Odessa. He said he had decided to stay for now, as he believed the war scare was overhyped and he had family, friends and colleagues in the city. For a number of weeks, the messaging of western capitals, particularly Washington and London, has been sharply at odds with the tone taken by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. This has led to mutual irritation, with many foreign officials feeling Zelenskiy, a former comedian, is out of his depth and refusing to take an evident threat seriously. Zelenskiy’s circle, meanwhile, say the constant warnings of imminent invasion coming from Washington are helping to sow panic in the country and are causing economic chaos. David Stulík, a former EU diplomat in Kyiv, said the evacuations could be part of “strategic messaging” to the Russians to show that the west is taking the situation seriously. But many Ukrainians expressed frustration with the withdrawals, saying that with the potential shutting down of airspace in the coming days, it felt like Ukraine, not Russia, was being sanctioned. “Western citizens are ordered to leave, but we don’t have anywhere to go. How should that be perceived by average Ukrainians?” said Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of Ukraine’s Anti-Corruption Action Centre. She said western nations should move immediately to put a stop to the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and impose personal sanctions on Kremlin-linked oligarchs, rather than reserve these measures for after a Russian attack. “If you have intelligence that is really strong enough to evacuate your citizens, then you have strong reasons to act tough on Russia right now,” said Kaleniuk. Some diplomats in Kyiv say the images of the chaotic withdrawal and evacuation efforts from Afghanistan last year are playing heavily on the minds of decision-makers in western capitals. In Britain, the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, explicitly made the comparison. “Following the chaos of the evacuation from Afghanistan, we ask the government for reassurance that the right lessons have been learned,” he said. Others wonder whether the fall of Kabul to the Taliban is a helpful comparison for a country that has land borders with several EU member states in the west. “Russians, if they entered Ukraine or even Kyiv, would not be chasing local staff of western embassies, and all embassies would continue their work,” said Stulík. However, he said the evacuations were a sensible temporary precaution against the worst-case scenario. Russia’s foreign ministry has also said it will “optimise” staff at its embassy and three consulates in Ukraine. Spokesperson Maria Zakharova said this was due to “possible provocations from the Kyiv regime or third countries”. It was not immediately clear how severely the withdrawal of US, UK and Canadian monitors will affect the OSCE mission in eastern Ukraine. The mission had 680 international monitors, according to a January report, of whom 57 were from the US, 40 from the UK and 28 from Canada. Helga Maria Schmid, the OSCE secretary general, wrote on Twitter that the monitoring mission and other OSCE projects in Ukraine “will continue to fulfil their mandates without interruption”. It is unclear whether other countries will also pull their staff in coming days. “If I had been given a choice, I would have stayed, but there was definitely no choice about it,” said one American member of the mission, who was in the process of being evacuated for a minimum of 30 days, after which there would be a “security review”. “There is a bit of head-scratching here about why people are being pulled from an active conflict area for safety reasons, because of a potential conflict that hasn’t manifested yet,” said the US citizen.",News/World news,‘It is past time to leave Ukraine’: western diplomats flee Kyiv,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/13/it-is-past-time-to-leave-ukraine-western-diplomats-flee-kyiv
2/14/2022,"The announcement of a plan to expand Covid vaccinations to all children aged five to 11 has been delayed amid an apparent impasse between the government and its vaccinations watchdog. While the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisation (JCVI) made its decision more than a week ago, Downing Street is reviewing the verdict. A decision is now expected to be announced on 21 February, when Boris Johnson unveils the government’s long-term Covid plan.  The JCVI’s recommendation has not yet been made public. It is understood it will expand vaccinations to all younger children but via a “non-urgent” offer to parents, given the relatively small health risks to the age group. Clinically vulnerable five- to 11-year-olds were offered vaccines from December, but moves to expand the programme to all younger children were held up to allow the JCVI to hear a broad range of evidence on the issue. Officials scheduled a briefing to announce the advice on Friday of last week, and then for this Monday, but it has been again delayed, prompting some bafflement within the JCVI. Ministers are deciding whether to accept the recommendation, with a decision coming in just over a week when Boris Johnson is due to outline his long-term strategy for Covid. It is set to include an end to all domestic restrictions in England. A government spokesperson said: “No decisions have been made by ministers on the universal offer of a Covid-19 vaccine to all five- to 11-year-olds. We are committed to reviewing the JCVI’s advice as part of wider decision-making ahead of the publication of our long-term strategy for living with Covid-19.” The move appears especially unusual given that, while JCVI recommendations are seen by ministers before being announced, this is usually just a brief process to consider legal and logistical issues. This is ordinarily done by the health department, not No 10. Ministers have previously expressed frustration at the JCVI’s caution in extending vaccines to children, an area where the UK lags behind several EU nations and the US. The vaccines watchdog, which is completely independent, has a remit which means its decisions are meant to be based largely on the health impact on the particular cohort being considered, and less on wider benefits such as lower Covid transmission and the impact on education. In September, the JCVI declined to recommend vaccination for healthy 12- to 15-year-olds, saying the margin of benefit was “considered too small”. But in an unprecedented suggestion it said ministers could consider seeking separate advice on areas outside its remit, such as disruption to schools, and make a different decision – which they did. With Covid vaccinations the JCVI makes recommendations, which health departments in the four UK nations decide whether to accept. The confusion around JCVI advice comes as the government faced further criticism for suggestions that access to free lateral flow tests could be reduced or removed all together. According to sources speaking to the Guardian last week the Treasury is looking at a number of options to cut spending, with the provision of free lateral flow tests to people without symptoms expected to end. While a government spokesperson said there are no plans to stop free tests when regulations are due to end on 24 February, following Johnson’s announcement Dr Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said the alleged idea was concerning. “I remain astonished at the prospect of dismantling our testing system and, more specifically at the withdrawal of free tests,” he said. “Even if we come to a point where asymptomatic testing en masse feels no longer viable, the opportunity to test prior to engaging with at risk activities, or more importantly with at risk people, should remain. It certainly shouldn’t be restricted to those wealthy enough to afford it.” Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist and molecular oncologist at the University of Warwick, said ending free tests “reinforces the misplaced view that the pandemic is over and that we can all go back to a pre-pandemic world where Covid doesn’t exist”. He added: “This move will encourage people not to bother about getting tested, leaving those who are actively infectious to spread the virus. Those who recognise the value of testing and are concerned about spreading the virus to elderly relatives and the clinically vulnerable will be tempted to stock up on lateral flow tests while they remain free – and who can blame them?” A further 41,270 positive Covid cases in the UK were reported on Sunday, together with a further 52 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. While the trend in daily reported cases – which reflects infections picked up by testing – continues to show a marked decline, data from the Office for National Statistics, based on swabs collected from randomly selected households, suggests infection levels nonetheless remain high. While trends in the ONS data is typically lagged by a couple of weeks compared with case data – in part because the former can include people who test positive for some time after acquiring their infection – the latest ONS figures suggest about one in 19 people in England had the virus in the week ending 5 February.",News/Society,Plan to jab children aged 5-11 delayed amid No 10 and JCVI impasse ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/13/plan-to-covid-jab-children-aged-5-11-delayed-amid-no-10-and-jcvi-impasse
2/14/2022,"John Harris’s article about Sheffield and the impact of the closure of Debenhams and John Lewis (The death of the department store, 10 February) raised many questions, not least “What are city centres for?” Historically, they were the most accessible locations in a large urban area. The advent of the private car, and free use of roads, has made almost anywhere easy to get to. The cost, however, of sprawl, pollution and energy usage will become limiting as we move towards a zero-carbon economy. As the architect Adam Park said in Harris’s article: “We shouldn’t be demolishing buildings any more.” The out-of-town Meadowhall shopping centre was approved by the city council to replace a brownfield former steelworks site. Surprisingly, no mention was made of Sheffield’s tram network; prior to the pandemic, this had provided a counter to Meadowhall by carrying passengers parked there into the city centre. There are three other lines, making the centre nearly as well-connected as Manchester through Metrolink. As an acceptable alternative to car travel, this offers a sustainable way to get people into the centre and, learning from the Strong Towns movement, is a good starting point for the reinvention of Sheffield.Prof Lewis LesleyLiverpool   It was obvious from the outset the huge out-of-town shopping centres such as Meadowhall that were promoted in the Thatcher era – often on the sites of old heavy industry – would kill historic town centres. Yet not until the damage had been done did John Major’s government reverse the preference, with hundreds more developments lining up for permission before the axe was due to fall. A sweetener for Meadowhall was to have been a major artwork, The Ride of Life. Several brilliant and witty automaton makers were to produce a ride-on entertainment, possibly to placate those who saw only raw neoliberalism at work in the mall. Inevitably the developer reneged and the artworks were dispersed. Some resurfaced in Kinetica, a short-lived display in Spitalfields Market, before that too fell to redevelopment. John Harris says he was struck by the number of places in the centre of Sheffield where people can just sit and pass the time. In places like Meadowhall the pressure is to consume, and much of what appears to be public space is in fact privately owned and controlled. Sheffield needs to pay greater attention to the two local experts who oppose demolition and “residential towers” for the John Lewis site than to the inevitable external consultants who are the instant resort of any local authority with a few million pounds for “consultation”. Local people are more likely to know what makes the old steel city tick.Judith MartinWinchester, Hampshire  In John Harris’s sensitive and informed article, he mentions the richness of the music that began to emerge in Sheffield in the 70s and 80s, which gave vibrancy to the city. Many of us would add how that cultural richness also included the long residence of The Lindsays, a world-class string quartet who chose to live and play in Sheffield from the early 70s until they retired in 2005. Their legacy has since flourished with Music in the Round, whose home continues to be at the city’s Crucible theatre. Their contribution to classical music playing among the young in their schools is now going from strength to strength.Jane and Simon ClementsSheffield  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/14/2022,"Your review of Hamlet at Guildford’s Holy Trinity Church (9 February) says “Shakespeare gives a variety of … reasons for young Hamlet’s inability to avenge” his father’s murder. No he doesn’t. Hamlet is not unable to stab Claudius. He wants to make sure the ghost’s story is true (hence the performance of The Mousetrap), and he doesn’t want Claudius to die while praying (and in a state of grace). Thereafter, his fatal flaw, like that of other Shakespearean protagonists, is rashness (stabbing the wrong man in his haste). As to the “usual complication” of whether Hamlet is really mad, or is pretending to be, he is neither. Who says that Hamlet is mad? Polonius, who, too stupid and pompous to understand his witty remarks, thinks they don’t make sense, and Claudius, who clearly doesn’t want anyone to take Hamlet seriously.  Hamlet really isn’t the mysterious and complicated play that it is made out to be. But in the past century or so, these and other notions (such as Hamlet’s Oedipal attraction to his mother) have unfortunately been taken as fact by readers, playgoers, directors, teachers, critics and actors.

But since 2010, medical student numbers have increased by 31% – with only a 0.4% increase in positions for the clinical academics who train them. Besides university staff and infrastructure, medical students require the support of junior doctors in their workplace-based placements. But this is impossible to provide, with increasing numbers of students on the wards coupled with the pressure on service provision. As a doctor in her first year of practice, I am dismayed to have to turn students away, but I am aware that they often do not have the support on the ward to achieve their curriculum outcomes.

2/14/2022,"Mikhaël Hers has made a likably unassuming and easygoing movie set in 1980s Paris; a world of LPs and stonewashed denim, with TV news archive footage interspersed in the drama. We start with the celebrations that marked Mitterrand’s presidential victory in 1981 and end towards the end of the decade with the younger characters preparing to cast their first vote. This is a film that doesn’t set out to push your emotional buttons all that hard, or even at all. But it covers a surprising amount of narrative ground and there is always something engaging and tender to it. The director appears to be aiming at the unshowy drama of Éric Rohmer. Three of his teen characters are shown sneaking into a cinema via the exit doors without paying, intending to see Joe Dante’s Gremlins but instead blundering into a screen showing Rohmer’s Full Moon in Paris and being unexpectedly entranced by it. Later they are shocked to hear about its star, Pascale Ogier, dying at the age of 25.  Charlotte Gainsbourg plays Elisabeth, a woman recovering from breast cancer and divorce, living with her teenage son and daughter in a large, somewhat chaotic flat with a beautiful view across the city. Her husband, who is now renting somewhere else with his new girlfriend, will however eventually want to sell the flat and divide the cash as part of their divorce, something to add to Elisabeth’s uneasy new sense of rootlessness. (Husband and new girlfriend are never seen, and Hers’s unwillingness to absorb their existence into the film’s fabric is, I think, a flaw.) Trying to get a job, she somehow lucks into a rather desirable position behind the scenes on an all-night phone-in radio show, putting callers through to the hardbitten presenter, in which role Emmanuelle Béart gives her most assured performance for a while. Elisabeth, after a while, even gets to fill on the mic when the star is on holiday, but there is no great importance attached to this: she doesn’t get to be a star and she is later shown getting a humble second job in a library to supplement her modest income. The plot is set in motion when Elisabeth takes an interest in the show’s special guest one evening: Talulah (Noée Abita) is a teen runaway, crashing on people’s floors, at risk of drug abuse. Elisabeth realises that no one on the show is interested in what happens to Talulah after the interview is over, so she invites her back to her flat. Talulah is to come and go in their lives for the next decade and toy with Elisabeth’s son’s heart. Like Hers’s previous film Amanda, this is a calm, sympathetic drama about family in which the dramatic wattage level is set relatively low. Even when extravagantly tense things are happening – Elisabeth’s son falls into the Seine and Talulah jumps in to save him – things are determinedly kept under control. The point, as with Amanda, is healing: things coming together and working out and pain being smoothed away. Elisabeth realises how sad she is at her “empty nest” situation as the kids move out, especially as she has to sell her nest and move to a smaller one. But group hugs help salve the pain and there is something sweet-natured in the film’s positive attitude to life.

2/14/2022,"Almost seven years after the spectacular collapse of Kids Company, the truth about what happened then is not widely enough known. A report from the Charity Commission released last week ought to have cleared things up. But by emphasising a technical finding of “mismanagement”, while downplaying the comprehensive vindication of the charity’s trustees in the high court, the commission has pulled its punches – perhaps for fear of offending the government, which spent £9.5m in a failed attempt to get Kids Company’s trustees and CEO, Camila Batmanghelidjh, disqualified as company directors. The problems at Kids Company identified by the Charity Commission and others must be treated seriously. The charity expanded rapidly, with expenditure rising from £2.4m in 2004 to £23m in 2013, and arguably did not pay enough attention to the risks such growth entailed. Had it built up larger reserves, it might have been better able to withstand the storm that broke when allegations that it had mishandled reports of sexual abuse were made (police found “no evidence of criminality”). There was a lack of psychotherapy and youth work expertise on the board, meaning trustees may have been limited in the forms of challenge offered to their charismatic chief executive and main fundraiser.  But compared with the charge sheet laid before the public (via the media), the courts, parliament and the Charity Commission, these are minor failings. The claim made in 2015 and never properly dispelled, despite a high court judgment in the charity’s favour, was that Kids Company was dysfunctional if not rotten, and needed to be stopped from doing the social welfare work with which it was entrusted, by ministers as well as civil society (the charity won £42m in government grants over a 15-year period). When a committee of MPs looked into what had happened in 2016, their report largely stuck by this version of events, blaming the “unaccountable and dominant” Ms Batmanghelidjh for the charity’s woes. Several years on, it should be obvious that Keeping Kids Company – the charity’s full name – never deserved to become a byword for poor governance and shoddy practice. Its trustees were praised by Mrs Justice Falk, who also noted Ms Batmanghelidjh’s “enormous dedication”. The charity’s unconventional methods, including cash payments to some of those it supported, were not a panacea. The organisation was too reliant on one personality, and its geographical expansion to Bristol and Liverpool was arguably overambitious. But this was an ambition egged on by a government firmly committed to increasing the role of the voluntary sector, while shrinking that of the state. Ms Batmanghelidjh was a social entrepreneur. And her treatment can be viewed as a kind of punishment. At a time when demand was rising due to cuts, she inadvertently and inconveniently exposed the weakness of social services outsourcing. There are important lessons here, not least about the vulnerability of charities to unproven claims. Kids Company bears some responsibility for accounting mistakes, and the way in which its sudden collapse left vulnerable people in the lurch. But the danger arising from the commission’s reluctance to be clear about the extent to which Kids Company was vilified wrongly is that the sector overall ends up weaker – with its appetite for innovation and supply of willing trustees reduced. At a time when council-funded social welfare provision – including vital mental health services – is dangerously limited and hard to access, this is a grave risk to take.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Kids Company: unfair treatment | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/13/the-guardian-view-on-kids-company-unfair-treatment
