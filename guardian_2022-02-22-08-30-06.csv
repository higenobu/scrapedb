2/22/2022,"A “crisis of confidence in policing” can only be put right through fundamental reform or risk the end of policing by consent, the head of a review of the police service will warn on Tuesday. Sir Michael Barber, the chair of the Strategic Review of Policing in England and Wales, will say that a “Betamax police force” is unsuccessfully pursuing “blockchain-enabled criminals” as he urges modernisation of crime-fighting technology and new training for officers.  His intervention comes just weeks before the publication of the findings of his review, which is expected to make more than 50 recommendations for the future of forces in England and Wales. It also follows the resignation of the UK’s most senior police officer, Cressida Dick, as head of the Met after multiple allegations of misogyny and racism among the UK’s largest force. In front of an audience of senior figures from police forces, criminal justice bodies and government officials at the Centre for Policy Studies webinar, Barber will say: “There is a clear crisis of confidence in policing in England and Wales. This is not just the result of recent high-profile issues but is far more fundamental. “Huge societal, technological and environmental changes are happening at warp speed yet too often policing seems stuck in the past, hardly fit for the present yet alone the future.” In comments which will question police cuts under recent governments, Barber will say that the blue line is stretched “too thin” and is focused on dealing with social issues instead of fighting and preventing crime. “It is encouraging that more police are now being recruited but there is a long way to go. Too often our police are effectively a social service dealing more with mental health and family breakdown than a crime-fighting or crime-prevention service. We need more police and they need a laser focus on the crime challenges of today,” he will say. “In the digital age, where the dark web is often the new crime frontline, it can feel like a contest between a Betamax police force and blockchain enabled criminals. As an illustration, we have a National Police Computer that is nearly 50 years old and is an emblem of the past rather than a cutting-edge tool of the present.” In a nod to the recent revelations of racist, sexist and homophobic comments made by officers at Charing Cross station, he will say: “Taken together with some deep-rooted issues around professional development, training and leadership, the challenges for our police are great and growing. “In two weeks we will publish our report, which will make 54 recommendations for change, and I hope it will mark a fundamental turning point in the modernisation of a public service that matters deeply to us all. Barber, who served as the chief adviser on delivery during Tony Blair’s second term as prime minister, will be joined by policing minister Kit Malthouse and Surrey police and crime commissioner Lisa Townsend for the discussion. Malthouse is expected to say: “We know that crime is changing and that the future will present new challenges to policing. “I thank Sir Michael for his work and I look forward to looking at this report and the recommendations once released to make sure we take the right action to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.”",News/UK news,Police review chief says ‘Betamax police’ stuck in the past ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/21/police-review-chief-says-betamax-police-stuck-in-the-past
