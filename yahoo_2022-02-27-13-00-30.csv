2/27/2022,"(Bloomberg) — International banks are talking publicly about how the business impact of Russia’s Ukraine invasion will be limited. In private, they’re debating the chances of nuclear conflict. Most Read from Bloomberg Taiwan to Join in U.S.-Led Sanctions on Russia: Ukraine Update Russia Invasion of Ukraine Ignites European Security Crisis Russia Says It’s Ready for Talks With Ukraine on Neutral Status Russia Says Kyiv Rejects Talks; Putin Sanctioned: Ukraine Update Russia Hits Airfields; Kyiv Imposes Martial Law: Ukraine Update Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on Thursday put its clients on the phone with Alex Younger, ex-chief of Britain’s MI6 intelligence service and now an adviser to the Wall Street giant. It’s the first time in more than 30 years that the threat of nuclear confrontation is a real possibility, he said. The episode is a jarring example of how the banking world is lurching into unknown territory with this conflict, in the same way as everyone else. For all the months of warnings and scenario planning, Russian tanks crossing the border has left bankers scrambling. Firms such as Deutsche Bank AG and Commerzbank AG were eager to say on Thursday that their direct financial exposure to Russia was “well contained” and “manageable.” They have a point: Only France’s Societe Generale SA, Italy’s UniCredit SpA and Austria’s Raiffeisen Bank International AG have a substantial on-the-ground presence in Russia. How War in Ukraine Threatens the World’s Economic Recovery But the indirect costs of the new barrage of sanctions being unleashed by the White House, Brussels and 10 Downing Street are far harder to quantify. The EURO STOXX index of leading European bank shares has fallen about 11% this week as investors weigh up the risks to the broader economy and to the trading and private-wealth operations of the finance industry. Banks have been locked in urgent mapping exercises to try to work out their trading exposure to counterparties backed by Russian money, according to a lawyer who works with many large financial institutions. UBS Group AG moved quickly to limit its exposure to Russian assets on Thursday, triggering margin calls on some wealth clients that use Russian bonds as collateral. Wall Street firms aren’t immune. Banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. move vast amounts of money around the world via their treasury services businesses, which makes them de facto enforcers of sanctions. Any time a transaction with a sanctioned entity comes through, the banks have to block and freeze. “Even if you don’t directly have a Russian sanctioned bank as a client you’re not entirely sure whether the transaction you’re handing will go through a Russian bank,” Eric Li, head of transaction banking at Coalition Greenwich, said. “The chain is very complex.” Russia isn’t Iran, North Korea or Venezuela, with their limited links to global business. Banks have to dig through the myriad ways they can wind up with an exposure to an economy and finance system as big as Russia’s — or to the wealthy bunch of oligarchs who’ve been enriched under Vladimir Putin’s rule. Banks also have to confront a striking geopolitical risk: Russia is a nuclear state, and Putin took the Cold-War era step of boasting about its arsenal in a speech trying to rationalize the invasion. President Joe Biden was even asked Thursday whether he thought Putin was threatening a nuclear strike. “I have no idea what he’s threatening,” Biden told reporters at the White House. The comprehensive nature of the Russia sanctions is unprecedented. On Thursday afternoon, Biden unveiled a raft of new measures, including freezing the assets of four major Russian banks, Sberbank PJSC and VTB Bank PJSC among them. Clay Lowery of the Institute of International Finance said the new measures are aimed at causing domestic bank runs, among other things. “These sanctions will have a significant impact on Russia’s overall economy, and average Russians will feel the cost,” Lowery said. But the impact on foreign lenders from these specific curbs is expected to be limited because “existing sanctions, the risk of additional measures, and over-compliance have led many to scale back engagements” already, the IIF wrote in a recent report. Biden and British prime minister Boris Johnson decided to hold off on cutting Russia’s access to Swift, the global messaging system for the world’s financial institutions. The option is still on the table for future retaliation. In the finance industry, there’s a question of whether an exit from Swift would cause as many problems for international banks as for the Russian government. Biden’s targeting of a broad swath of Russian elites and their family members, following a similar move by Johnson will be of greater concern to banks with large wealth management operations, especially those in Europe. Swiss private banks are historically a prime destination for Russian money, as is the City of London. “In terms of oligarchs involved there’s a lot to unscramble here and there are fire drills happening everywhere around London,” said Michelle Linderman, sanctions lawyer at Crowell & Moring LLP.

2/27/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Banks are taking precedence for President Vladimir Putin as Russia devises a domestic response to sanctions rolled out by western governments over the invasion of Ukraine. Most Read from Bloomberg U.S. Adds Putin, Sergei Lavrov to Sanctions List: Ukraine Update Taiwan to Join in U.S.-Led Sanctions on Russia: Ukraine Update Kyiv Under Fire as U.S. Prepares to Sanction Putin for Invasion Russia Invasion of Ukraine Ignites European Security Crisis China State Banks Restrict Financing for Russian Commodities Russian state aid will initially focus on assisting lenders hit with penalties, according to two people who attended a closed meeting with Putin to address the impact of the conflict on big business. First Deputy Prime Minister Andrey Belousov asked the gathered billionaires and corporate titans to keep working with sanctioned banks, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the meeting was private. The remarks came after the public part of the Thursday event, in which Putin warned that the west shouldn’t seek to push Russia out of the global economy. The message underscores the urgency facing the government at home while the showdown in Ukraine intensifies. Retaining depositor confidence is crucial in a country where bouts of economic turmoil have in the past wiped out savings and prompted bank runs. Belousov didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The promise of aid came in the hours before the U.S. announced it would sanction many of Russia’s biggest lenders, including state-owned Sberbank PJSC and VTB Group, targeting nearly 80% of Russian banking assets. President Joe Biden said the measures “exceed anything that’s ever been done” and will hamper Russia’s ability to do business in foreign currency. VTB was also hit with full blocking sanctions, while the U.K. announced an asset freeze against major Russian banks, including an immediate freeze against VTB. Sberbank head Herman Gref and VTB chief Andrey Kostin attended the meeting in the Kremlin’s St. Catherine Hall, the same room where Putin convened his security council two days earlier in a staged event to weigh the invasion of Ukraine. Gazprom’s Alexey Miller and Igor Sechin, the head of Rosneft who was sanctioned Thursday by the U.S., were also in attendance. Details of the U.S., EU and U.K. Sanctions Against Russia The measures by western governments came as Russian forces push deeper into Ukraine in a three-pronged attack and move closer to the capital, Kyiv. The European Union also backed a broad sanctions package to limit Russia’s access to Europe’s financial sector and restricting key technologies. But the penalties also included carve-outs for energy payments, a crucial source of revenue for Moscow, and held off from barring Russia from the Swift international banking network. Despite isolated reports of Russians queuing to withdraw cash, calm has largely prevailed so far and markets stabilized on Friday. Sberbank shares rallied Friday 4.6% as of 3:00 p.m. in Moscow but are down by more than half this week. Shares in VTB were down 4.7% after falling 42% Thursday. The U.S. sanctions do not come into force for a month, which could help explain the relative calm. In December 2014, plunging oil prices sent the ruble crashing and led to clients withdrawing 1.3 trillion rubles ($15 billion) in a single week from Sberbank. Business as Usual? Sberbank said its branches continue to function as usual and clients are not facing any restrictions, including on currency exchange. Before the sanctions were announced on Thursday, it published a statement that it later retracted about how a ban on foreign exchange operations would affect corporate customers. VTB responded with a statement saying the “sanctions came as no surprise” and that it has several plans to counter the measures to minimize the impact on its clients. It also sold its stakes in Pochta Bank and Cyprus-based RCB Bank. Even so, the central bank on Friday advised banks to postpone dividend payments and bonuses to managers to maintain financial stability. It also announced it loosened the short-term liquidity ratio for systemically important banks. Many Russian lenders have scaled back their international ambitions since being hit sectoral sanctions since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine. VTB maintains offices in London and Zug, Switzerland, as well as China, Angola and some post-Soviet states. State-owned banks have been bracing for more sanctions as relations with the West deteriorated. Russia has built up its financial reserves to over $600 billion, developed a domestic payments system, Mir, and steadily reduced reliance on foreign currency. The central bank said early Friday it would support sanctioned banks and noted that about 80% of the balances at the affected lenders are in rubles. It offered help with rubles and foreign currency. A day earlier, the Bank of Russia announced it will intervene in the foreign exchange market for the first time in years, expand its Lombard list of securities accepted as collateral and provide additional liquidity to lenders in repo auctions. “After 2014, Russia has been preparing for a dark day,” said Anton Tabakh, chief economist at Moscow-based credit assessor Expert RA. “The banking system is well capitalized, there are reserves and capabilities. The central bank is acting very reasonably.” (Updates with central bank advice under ‘Business as Usual’ subheadline) Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek A Pandemic Baby Bump Shines a Spotlight on the Nordic Welfare Model Cyberwar: How Nations Attack Without Bullets or Bombs Removing Résumés From Hiring Process Can Improve Diversity Wall Street Is Buying Starter Homes to Quietly Become America’s Landlord Elon Musk’s Boring Company Plots Texas Tunnels ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",World/Bloomberg•2 days ago,Putin Huddles With Tycoons to Offer Banks Bulk of State Aid,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/putin-huddles-tycoons-offer-banks-143622772.html
