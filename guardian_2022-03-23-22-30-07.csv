3/23/2022,"A British army veteran accused of killing two civilians in the Bloody Sunday massacre in Derry in 1972 may face prosecution after a high court judge quashed a decision by the public prosecution service to drop murder charges. The chief justice, Mrs Justice Keegan, said the decision by the PPS not to continue the prosecution of Soldier F, as he is codenamed, for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney “crossed the threshold of irrationality” and was illogical. She said the PPS must now reconsider the case, raising fresh questions about the viability of new legislation planned by the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, to give, in effect, an amnesty to accused army veterans. The PPS announced last year it was discontinuing the prosecution amid concerns the case could collapse in light of a separate court ruling on the admissibility of evidence, which caused another Troubles murder trial, involving two military veterans, to be dropped. The McKinney family then launched a judicial review to challenge the PPS decision. Delivering the verdict on Wednesday, Keegan said: “We consider that the decision crosses the threshold of irrationality where it simply does not add up, or in other words there is an error of reasoning which robs the decision of logic. It follows that the matter should remain with the PPS to reconsider the decision. “There has already been considerable delay in the criminal process and so it may be that the swiftest and most effective course is actually for the district judge to be asked to rule on the admissibility issue in the first instance. “It may be that public confidence in the interests of justice are best served by a definitive judicial determination on this issue by a court properly seized of the merits. “The PPS will now have to decide on the next steps.” The court dismissed judicial reviews taken by a number of other Bloody Sunday families to challenge the PPS decision not to prosecute five other veterans. The chief justice said she considered there was “no error in law” in these decisions. Bloody Sunday, on 30 January 1972, was one of the darkest days in Northern Ireland’s history, when British soldiers shot dead 13 civil rights protesters in the Bogside area of Derry. Soldiers from the Parachute Regiment had shot 100 times into the crowds, killing 13 people. No one has been tried for the killings, despite the 12-year Saville inquiry, which rejected the commanding officer’s claim they had acted in self-defence. Last month Tony Doherty, the chair of the Bloody Sunday Trust, who was nine when his father, Patrick, was killed said no one should have to wait 50 years for justice.",News/UK news,Belfast court quashes decision to stop Bloody Sunday prosecution of Soldier F,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/belfast-court-quashes-decision-to-stop-bloody-sunday-prosecution-of-soldier-f

You could be in with the chance of securing a web presence to match your regional pride as the domain name Yorkshire.com goes up for auction, following the collapse of the Yorkshire tourist board. The Welcome to Yorkshire tourism body was placed into administration three weeks ago, after a £1.4m funding gap opened up when the pandemic crushed business rates in the area. Half the staff were made redundant, with the chairman, Sir Peter Box, describing “increasingly challenging” financial circumstances, and the administrators are now seeking to sell the body as a going concern. Some of the assets will be auctioned off individually, however – including more than 150 domain names owned by the board. “We are seeing significant interest in the business as a going concern from the travel & tourism sector as we’d expect, in addition to multiple enquiries from publishing outlets,” said Andrew Cromack, BPI asset advisory director and RICS valuer, who will oversee the online auction “A domain such as www.yorkshire.com coming to market will always cause a stir due to its rarity. From existing Yorkshire businesses or those expanding into the region, brands looking for campaign domains or simply proud Yorkshire bidders, we expect high levels of interest.” Those proud Yorkshire bidders could secure madebyyorkshire.com, perhaps for an email address like “Jim.is@madebyyorkshire.com”, for an opening bid of just £100, or the rather more specific “visityorkshirecoast.com” for a bid of £250.

3/23/2022,"Rishi Sunak has cut fuel duty by 5p a litre, raised the threshold at which workers start paying national insurance by £3,000 a year and announced a future 1p reduction in income tax in response to the fastest rise in the cost of living in three decades. On a day when the annual inflation rate rose to 6.2%, the chancellor said income tax would be cut from 20p to 19p in 2024, while his £6bn national insurance initiative would offset the impact of across-the-board price increases. The chancellor used his spring mini budget to announce an immediate fuel duty cut for motorists and a £330-a-year cut per worker in NI for those struggling to make ends meet. VAT on energy efficiency products was cut from 5% to zero. Sunak had been under strong pressure from some Tory MPs to scrap his planned rise in employers and employees national insurance contributions but said it was important to repair the damage to the public finances caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Two years to the day after the announcement of the first Covid-19 lockdown, the chancellor admitted the Russian invasion of Ukraine would lead to slower than expected growth and higher inflation this year than previously forecast. The independent office for budget responsibility said it was now pencilling in growth of 3.8% for the UK this year, compared with the 6% it had been forecasting when Sunak announced his budget last October.",News/UK news,Rishi Sunak lowers fuel duty by 5p and promises income tax cut,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/rishi-sunak-lowers-fuel-duty-by-5p-and-promises-income-tax-cut-spring-statement
3/23/2022,"Rishi Sunak opens by highlighting the war in Ukraine and says Britain’s economic strength underpins freedom and liberty. The chancellor says he will respond to the conflict by building a stronger, more secure economy for the UK. “The actions we have taken to sanction Putin’s regime are not cost free for us at home. The invasion of Ukraine presents a risk to our recovery as it does to countries around the world,” he says. Jessica Elgot, chief political correspondent: The invasion of Ukraine certainly puts an additional burden on the UK economy but consumers were already facing significant pressures from inflation and energy prices, as well as Sunak’s tax rise. Using the war in Ukraine to set the tone for the statement looks like the beginning of a strategy to at least partly attribute the pain of the cost of living to the crisis as a way of swerving political blame for the growth slowdown which was predicted well before Russia invaded. The chancellor says forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility show the economy will grow by 3.8% this year. GDP will grow by 1.8% next year, 2.1% in 2024, 1.8% in 2025, and 1.7% in 2026. In October, the OBR had forecast growth of 6% f0r 2022 as the UK economy recovers from the Covid pandemic. The economy grew by 7.5% in 2021, after a fall of 9.4% in 2020 – the biggest decline for a century – during the first wave of the pandemic. Jessica Elgot, chief political correspondent: Sunak uses these figures as a way to emphasise the difficult choices made in the rest of the statement. Again, he links them directly to the Ukraine crisis, saying choices to sanction Putin’s regime were not cost free. The chancellor says the OBR forecasts inflation will average 7.4% this year. Fuel duty will be cut for only the second time in 20 years, by 5p a litre for a full 12 months. Sunak says the fuel duty cut is worth £5bn and takes effect from 6pm on Wednesday. The government will cut a 5% VAT rate for households installing solar panels, heat pumps, insulation to zero. Sunak says he will double the government’s household support fund to £1bn. Jessica Elgot, chief political correspondent: The cut to fuel duty was one of the only actions well trailed by Treasury sources ahead of the statement, after a concerted campaign by Conservative MPs and tabloid papers. But, in a nod to the divide still raging in the party, there is a net zero sweetener to the first fuel duty cut in years – a VAT cut to help households install energy efficiency measures. Sunak says borrowing in the current financial year, 2021-22, will be 5.4 of GDP, and will fall to 3.9% next year. In cash terms, the OBR estimates the budget deficit – the gap between spending and income – will be £127.8bn in 2021-22, and £99.1bn next year. In its previous forecasts in October, the OBR had estimated borrowing would be 7.9% of GDP, or £183bn in cash terms, in 2022-23. The chancellor says debt service costs will rise to £83bn in the next fiscal year, the highest level on record. Public sector net debt is forecast to be 95.6% of GDP in 2021-22, and then fall gradually to 83.1% of GDP by 2026-27. “We should be prepared for the economy and public finances to worsen potentially significantly,” he says. Jessica Elgot, chief political correspondent: With higher than predicted receipts for the Treasury in a number of areas which have prompted lobbying for public spending, Sunak has continually stressed to MPs that the counter is the cost of the UK’s enormous borrowing, with March the third month in a row to break monthly debt interest records. Sunak says the planned 1.25 percentage point rise in national insurance contributions must remain, as a “dedicated funding source” for health and social care. However, he announces he will increase the threshold by £3,000 this year, up from a planned rise of £300. This equalises national insurance contributions threshold with the personal allowance of £12,570. He calls it a £6bn personal tax cut for 30 million people, and the largest single personal tax income in a decade. Jessica Elgot, chief political correspondent: As welcome as the change to the threshold will be, particularly for middle-income families, Sunak’s claim that the national insurance rise is definitely hypothecated for health and social care looks dubious, given it looks like the funding settlement will not actually be reduced. Sunak announces reforms to research and development tax credits, saying the generosity of reliefs for business investment will be increased to boost UK productivity. The chancellor says “something is not working” with UK investment in productivity. He says the government will cut tax rates on business investment at the autumn budget. The chancellor says he will increase the employment allowance for small businesses to £5,000 – a tax cut worth up to £1,000 for half a million small firms starting in two weeks’ time. Jessica Elgot, chief political correspondent: One of Sunak’s mantras is the need to work towards a high-productivity economy. He is right to conclude that something is not working and promises more action at the autumn budget to cut business taxes, the first of a number of “jam tomorrow” promises to try to rebuild his image as a tax cutter. Sunak says the basic rate of income tax will be cut from 20% to 19% in 2024. He says it would not be responsible to make such a tax cut right now, given the uncertainty in the economy. “Tax cuts must be paid for, they must be prioritised and they must fit the economic circumstances of the time,” he says. The chancellor says it will be the first cut in income tax for 16 years. Jessica Elgot, chief political correspondent: First reported in the Guardian on Monday. Sunak has gambled that the fiscal position will be stable enough for him to start to cut taxes in the autumn. But there is likely to be significant scrutiny of the choices here – a 1.25% NICs rise, paid by workers, and a cut to income tax, paid by everyone.",News/UK news,Spring statement 2022: key points at a glance,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/spring-statement-2022-key-points-rishi-sunak-budget
3/23/2022,"Lloyds Banking Group has announced it will shut another 60 branches across England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, in the latest example of the rapid decline of lenders on the high street. The closures consist of 24 branches of Lloyds Bank, 19 Bank of Scotland and 17 from the Halifax brand, resulting in the group cutting more than 150 from its network since June 2021. The move will result in 124 job losses, according to Unite, the union representing the banks’ workers. The affected branches will close by the end of the year, leaving the group with 1,416. Lloyds Banking Group, which controls Britain’s largest high street network, cited record usage of online banking in 2022 as the reason for the closures, as almost all of the UK’s large banking groups have done when closing branches. Lloyds said it had 18.6 million regular online banking customers and more than 15 million mobile app users across its brands – increases of 12% and 27% respectively over the past two years. Banking analysts said the closures of less-visited branches were all but inevitable as their profitability continued to fall owing to an increasing number of transactions. The Covid pandemic accelerated the shift to digital banking by forcing many customers to use online apps for the first time. Yet some politicians and worker representatives worry that the banks risk abandoning customers, particularly among the elderly, who do not have the digital skills to manage their money online. UK banks closed 4,735 branches since 2015 by December 2021 – almost half of the total – according to figures from Which? consumer group. Caren Evans, Unite’s national officer, said: “Lloyds Banking Group must not be allowed to abandon 60 more local communities where bank branches play an essential role. “The banking sector needs to answer some serious questions about its corporate social responsibilities and the government cannot stand back and allow the relentless closure of banks to continue until no more local banking services remain.” Vim Maru, Lloyds Banking Group’s group retail director, said: “Just like many other high street businesses, fewer customers are choosing to visit our branches. Our branch network is an important way for us to support our customers but we need to adapt to the significant growth in customers choosing to do most of their everyday banking online.” Bank of ScotlandAberdeen 201 Union StreetAlness, Ross and CromartyBrechin, AngusBroxburn, West LothianCarluke, South LanarkshireClarkstonDunblaneDyceEdinburgh (Barnton)Edinburgh (Shandwick)ForresGlasgow RiddrieInnerleithenKirkcudbrightLockerbieSelkirkShottsStromnessTroon HalifaxAbingdonBeaconsfieldBecclesBelfast (Shaftesbury)BidefordDevizesDoncaster Market PlaceDunstableFinchley CentralHalifax Commercial StreetMargateMorristonPengeTottonWokinghamWorcester ParkYeadon Lloyds BankAylesbury GatehouseBeaconsfieldBirmingham Temple RowBolton WesthoughtonBradford ThornburyBuckinghamChandlers FordChipping CampdenColchester St JohnsCottinghamEdgbastonKnutsfordLiverpool WooltonLyndhurstMarlowMorriston SwanseaOxford SummertownPoulton-le-FyldeRushdenShanklinShrewsbury Mount PleasantSmethwickSwanwickTiptree",News/Business,"Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland to shut 60 branches",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/23/lloyds-halifax-bank-of-scotland-shut-branches-england-wales-jobs-lost
3/23/2022,"Everyone on the planet should be covered by an early warning system against extreme weather and climate-related disasters within five years, the UN secretary general has said. About a third of people around the world are not now covered by early warning systems, but in Africa the problem is greater, with about six in 10 people lacking such warnings. As climate breakdown takes hold, more people are likely to be affected by extreme weather, including flash floods, heatwaves, more violent storms and coastal storm surges, made worse by sea level rises. António Guterres said it was unacceptable that so many people were still not covered by early warning systems, and pointed out that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had recently found half of humanity was “in the danger zone” for climate breakdown. He said: “Human-caused climate disruption is now damaging every region. The most recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change details the suffering already happening. Each increment of global heating will further increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.” Guterres has frequently called for half of the climate finance provided from rich to poor countries to be devoted to helping them adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis. At present, the vast majority of such finance goes to helping middle-income countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, while adaptation efforts are hard to finance. Guterres said: “We must invest equally in adaptation and resilience. That includes the information that allows us to anticipate storms, heatwaves, floods and droughts.” Ensuring the global population is covered by such warnings would cost about $1.5bn (£1.14bn) over five years, according to UN estimates. The UN hopes some funding will be forthcoming from the World Bank, and other multilateral development banks, and from development aid from rich countries, and is seeking private sector contributions, for instance from technology companies with expertise in providing data. A senior UN official said: “It will not be easy, it will be challenging, but when one looks at the potential costs of mobilising the resources to make this a reality, it’s a mere fraction, a mere rounding error of the $14tn mobilised by G20 countries over the last two years to recover their economies from Covid-19.” Guterres has asked the World Meteorological Organization to lead the effort to ensure everyone is covered by an early warning system. He has called for a plan on how to fulfil the target to be brought to the next UN climate summit, Cop27, to be held in Egypt in November. Having access to early warnings, even of only 24 hours, can reduce the damage from storms by about a third. The economic benefits of early warnings are also high: a report in 2019 by the Global Commission on Adaptation found that $800m invested in avoiding losses from climate-related damage could reduce damages by between $3bn and $16bn. Early warning systems can include storm warnings and high alerts for heatwaves, and in coastal areas broadcasts of high waves or tsunamis. The warnings can be sent by mobile phone, public broadcast systems or media such as radio, television and newspapers. After the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, many Asian countries overhauled their early warning systems, which can include public address systems at beaches and coastal towns to warn of imminent tsunamis. In the UK, severe weather warnings and flood alerts are given out on broadcast media, and posted on the Environment Agency website. However, the world’s least developed countries and small island states – many of which face inundation if global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – have the least coverage of early warning systems. Fionna Smyth, the head of global policy and advocacy at the charity Christian Aid, said rich countries must do much more. “The fact people who have done almost nothing to cause the climate crisis are still suffering and even dying at the hands of extreme weather underlines the cruel injustice of the climate crisis,” she said.",News/World news,UN chief calls for extreme weather warning systems for everyone on Earth,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/un-chief-calls-for-extreme-weather-warning-systems-for-everyone-on-earth
3/23/2022,"Florida governor Ron DeSantis has issued a proclamation that a resident of his state is the “rightful” holder of the NCAA 500m freestyle title won by trans swimmer Lia Thomas last week. Thomas made history last Thursday as the first known transgender athlete to win a US college swimming championship when she took the title in Atlanta. However, her victory caused a backlash among right-wing politicians as well as groups that oppose transgender athletes taking part in women’s competition. On Tuesday DeSantis, who many see as a Republican contender at the next US presidential election, declared that Emma Weyant, a Florida resident who competes for the University of Virginia and finished second to Thomas, was the “rightful winner” of the race. “It is my determination that men should not be competing against women such as Emma Weyant,” DeSantis wrote in his proclamation. “ … Florida rejects the NCAA’s efforts to destroy women’s athletics, disapproves of the NCAA elevating ideology over biology, and takes offense at the NCAA trying to make others complicit in a lie.” USA Swimming’s policy states that trans athletes must undergo three years of hormone replacement therapy before being allowed to compete. Thomas is six months short of that target but the NCAA decided not to adopt USA Swimming’s rules and allowed the senior to compete in Atlanta. DeSantis’s proclamation has no power to change last week’s result and is a continuation of policies in Florida that target the LGBTQ+ community. In June, he signed into law the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act, which bans anyone assigned as male at birth from competing in girls and women’s sports. The state’s ‘don’t say gay’ bill has also caused controversy, and this week the Orlando Pride soccer team apologized after barring a fan banner that contained the word “gay”. Thomas has received both support and criticism. On Monday, World Athletics president Sebastian Coe said transgender athletes pose a risk to the integrity of women’s sport. “Gender cannot trump biology. As a federation president, I do not have that luxury. It is a luxury that other organizations not at the practical end of having to deal with these issues have,” Coe told the Daily Telegraph. “But as far as I am concerned, the scientific evidence, the peer-reviewed work we have done, those regulations are the right approach.” But some of Thomas’s fellow swimmers have shown their support. Texas’ Erica Sullivan, who finished third behind Thomas and Weyant in the 500m freestyle, wrote an essay for Newsweek in which she argued women’s sports has other issues that are far more important to address. “As a woman in sports, I can tell you that I know what the real threats to women’s sports are: sexual abuse and harassment, unequal pay and resources and a lack of women in leadership. Transgender girls and women are nowhere on this list,” Sullivan wrote. Weyant has yet to comment publicly on DeSantis’s proclamation. Thomas, meanwhile, has chosen to restrict her comments to her swimming. “I try to focus on my swimming, what I need to do to get ready for my races and just try to block out everything else,” she said after Thursday’s victory.",Sport/Sport,Florida governor says trans swimmer Lia Thomas was not ‘rightful winner’ of NCAA title,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/23/ron-desantis-lia-thomas-trans-swimmer-ncaa-title-florida
3/23/2022,"The NHS is coming under “significant” pressure amid a rise in Covid cases in virtually every area of England, the chief medical officer has warned, with hospitalisations likely to continue increasing at least until April. Prof Chris Whitty said the mounting numbers of people becoming infected was likely to be largely driven by the new Omicron variant, BA.2. The sharp resurgence of the coronavirus underlined that the crisis “is not over”, Whitty added. Speaking at the annual conference of the Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Public Health, Whitty also said those hoping for an “end point” should not expect one, with coronavirus likely to remain a threat to public health for decades. Whitty raised concerns that other areas of public health had “gone backwards” in the last two years, including obesity and alcohol. Child obesity rates in particular were now “significantly worse” than they were at the start of the pandemic, he warned. However, while there was an urgent need to tackle problems in a number of other areas of public health, Covid-19 remained a major threat, he said. “Covid cases are now rising quite rapidly – from quite a high base – and this is driven by a number of different factors, of which BA.2, the new Omicron variant is a large part. Rates are high and rising in virtually all parts of England.” While the rise in cases was not leading to a surge in deaths, Whitty added, the NHS was seeing increasing numbers of people requiring hospital treatment for Covid. “If we look at hospitalisations, there are now quite significant numbers of people in hospital,” he told delegates at the conference. “They are now rising again, and I think will continue to rise for at least the next two weeks – so there is pressure on the NHS. “It is currently being driven by Omicron rather than new variants, but we need to keep a very close eye on this because at any point new variants could emerge anywhere in the world, including the UK, as happened with the Alpha variant.” The number of people in hospital with Covid in two regions of England has climbed to the highest level for more than a year. South-east England has now joined the south-west in recording patient levels last seen in February 2021, surpassing the peaks reached in the previous surge of infections at the start of 2022. A total of 1,956 people with Covid-19 were in hospital in the south-east on 21 March, the highest since 19 February last year, according to new figures from NHS England. And in south-west England 1,365 patients were recorded on 21 March, the highest since 9 February 2021. In both regions about half of people in hospital with Covid-19 are being treated primarily for something else rather than coronavirus. But the continuing rise in patients testing positive for Covid – up 26% week-on-week in the south-west and 20% in the south-east– is another sign of the growing prevalence of the virus across the country. The total number of people in hospital with Covid in England stands at 13,060, the highest figure since 31 January this year. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, said on Monday that despite the jump in infections and hospital patients, there was “no particular cause for concern”. Figures published on Friday by the Office for National Statistics showed that infection levels were continuing to rise across most of the UK, with 3.3 million people estimated to have coronavirus in the week to 12 March, up from 2.6 million the previous week. Asked by a delegate when the pandemic might end, Whitty said that while Covid would become less dominant over time, it would remain a significant problem across the world “for the rest of our lives”. “Let’s have no illusions about that. I’m expecting it to be probably – in the UK – seasonal but interspersed at least for the next two or three years by new variants … I think we should just accept that is what we’re going to deal with and just roll with it rather than expect some end point.”",News/World news,"NHS under pressure from new Covid wave across England, says Chris Whitty",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/nhs-under-pressure-from-new-covid-wave-across-england-says-chris-whitty
3/23/2022,"Households could end up funding £2.4bn of payments to energy suppliers that took on the customers of rivals that collapsed as a result of sky-high gas prices, the energy watchdog has told MPs, as it warned a second wave of failures could be on the horizon. In evidence to the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) select committee, Ofgem detailed the costs associated with the “supplier of last resort” system, under which customers of an energy supplier that collapses are transferred to a healthier utility company. Since the start of last year, 30 energy suppliers have gone bust, affecting nearly 4.5 million customers, with a sharp increase gas prices in early winter leading to a spate of failures. Suppliers of last resort that took on those customers, such as Octopus Energy and Shell, have had to buy more energy on wholesale markets and can charge the cost of that to local gas and electricity distribution networks from April. Those grid operators, in turn, will add the extra cost to what they charge suppliers for use of their systems. That means the money will eventually be added to household energy bills, which are predicted to soar to £3,000 a year or more, exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Ofgem said: “While it is still subject to significant uncertainty, our current estimate for total claims is approximately £2.2bn-£2.4bn.” The figure does not include costs associated with the collapse of Bulb, whose operations were taken into government control under the “special administration” regime, rather than being transferred to another operator. The consultancy firm Teneo was appointed to take over its affairs. It also warned MPs to brace for renewed chaos in the energy markets – potentially leading to another round of failures – because of the war in Ukraine. “The volatility in the gas market is not over. Indeed, it looks likely that we are entering a second, more serious phase that will have further consequences for customers and further financial strain for retail companies.” Ofgem said the first wave of energy supplier collapses had forced it to rethink the way it regulated the industry, which was likely to mean stricter regulation of companies but may also spell more frequent bill increases. The regulator said companies, many of which did not hedge against high wholesale gas prices, were not resilient enough and financial regulation needed to be significantly enhanced to ensure that they were, including a tougher stress testing regime. It added that the energy price cap, which was meant to ensure customers were not charged unfair prices, needed to adapt to rapidly changing market prices. From 1 April Ofgem can reopen the price cap in “exceptional circumstances”, and it is considering quarterly reviews. At the moment, the cap is reviewed every six months, with the most recent review in April allowing an increase of £693, to £1,971. Persistently high gas prices due to the Ukraine crisis have sparked predictions that the cap could increase to beyond £3,000 when the next one is announced in October. Gillian Cooper, the head of energy policy at Citizens Advice, told members of the committee that households should not bear the full cost of further energy company failures. “We need to move to a world where the costs of failures are not fully borne by energy bill payers,” she said. “We have estimated that the costs of all these energy supplier failures is going to cost in excess £2.4bn. That is about £94 per household. And that does not include the cost of the failure of Bulb, which is being treated separately under the special administration regime.”",News/Business,Ofgem warns of £2.4bn fallout from energy firm collapses,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/23/ofgem-fallout-energy-firm-collapses
3/23/2022,"One huge downside about the return to the workplace is lunch. At home, with full access to your kitchen and all the food you own, lunch could be a small event, a chance for you to break up the monotony of the day with a new recipe you’d been eager to try. Meanwhile, back at the office, you basically have to skint yourself every day on a mediocre shop-bought sandwich you’ve eaten a million times before. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Below, you will find 10 excellent, imaginative, quick and relatively easy lunches that you can make at home and eat at work. You’re welcome. Let’s start with the classics. The problem with sandwiches is that, unless you’re prepared to put a little effort in, you’re doomed to a life of damp sliced bread and wilted cheese. A little more time and preparation and you could be sauntering into work with Rebecca Oliver’s smoked mackerel, fennel and almond sandwich. Heaving focaccia, packed with smoked mackerel, grated horseradish and a spectacular fennel sauce: this is about 15 minutes’ work for something leagues above the norm. Then there is the pan bagnat, which is basically a niçoise salad sandwich. Perfectly Provence’s recipe is a little more labour-intensive than most, asking you to make your own mayonnaise, but I won’t rat you out if you’d prefer to spoon something out of a jar instead. The perfect thing about a pan bagnat is that it’s much better if you squash it down and leave it in a fridge for a few hours before you eat it, so it’s a good candidate to make before bed. We’re all about making something tasty and different to eat at work, not sandwiches that require a 40-minute ritual the night before. In which case, allow me to present Thomasina Miers’ easy-peasy pitta pockets. Cut a pitta in half and fill it with carrot ribbons, chopped spring onions, cheese and lettuce. It takes seconds to make, and packs a mighty punch. If you find bread a little too unimaginative, Rosie Birkett has a brilliant alternative in her savoury crepe wraps. The crepes are seasoned with turmeric and cumin and, when cooled, provide the perfect delivery vehicle for any filling you like. Birkett suggests cold roast chicken or cheese, salad and herbs, but she isn’t the boss of you. Let’s take a moment to remember the wonder that is readymade puff pastry. Grab a roll of it next time you go shopping, and you will enter a world of excellent lunch tarts. Caroline Craig and Sophie Missing have compiled a selection of four excellent toppings – my personal favourite is sausage, fennel and mustard – that you can quickly throw together, take to work and then drop all over your office floor. We probably need to address salads here. On paper, a salad is about the best thing you can eat for lunch – light on the stomach and potentially packed with nutrition. In reality, they’re often joyless and wilted by the time you come to eat it. Enter Grace Elkus’s antipasto grain salad, which comes billed as an “ultimate no-wilt” dish. The base of the salad is farro, which will hold up against pretty much anything, but comes livened up with mozzarella, peppers, olives and tomatoes. Make a big batch of this on Sunday night and it’ll see you through most of the week. For something more compact, Skinny Ms’ taco salad in a jar recipe is hard to top. Cook some turkey mince, whip up a quick yoghurt and avocado dressing, then pile it into a mason jar with salad, cheese and smashed-up tortilla chips. Unbeatable. Kimbap is a Korean rice roll, wrapped in seaweed and served in slices, and provides the perfect lunch portion. As My Korean Kitchen’s recipe demonstrates, it’s a dish that requires a lot of preparation. Carrots must be julienned, rice must be cooked, an omelette must be made. And, if you’re new to it, the assembly can be a little fiddly. But persevere! This is the world’s best sandwich alternative. A slightly easier alternative than the rice rolls would be a gyeran-mari, a filled omelette roll that’s most usually served cold or at room temperature. Korean Bapsang’s recipe is the most basic version – the omelette is filled with just carrot and spring onion – but once you’ve found your feet, you can start experimenting with ham, peppers or anything else you like. And now, finally, the daddy. Taste’s Kathy Knudsen has come up with a defiantly unhealthy, but blindingly brilliant, carbonara slice. That’s right, it’s a spaghetti carbonara that is essentially baked into a crustless quiche, then cut into rectangles and chilled. Tell me you don’t want to make this as soon as you can.",Lifestyle/Food,Back in the office? 10 luscious packed lunches to beat the soggy sandwich blues,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/23/back-in-the-office-10-luscious-packed-lunches-to-beat-the-soggy-sandwich-blues
3/23/2022,"My friend Peter Chippindale, a Guardian journalist, first drew my attention to the Birmingham pub bombings. He had reported on the trial in 1975 and remarked that he thought the men were innocent. He had come to that conclusion from his attendance at court and from talking to the relatives of the convicted men. Little did I realise that nearly 50 years later, long after the men had been freed and their convictions quashed, the case would still play a big part in my life. For many years I lacked resources, but I eventually persuaded the Granada Television programme World in Action to take me on to conduct a proper investigation. My Granada colleagues and I made three programmes. The first destroyed the forensic evidence that had been one of the two key planks of the prosecution case. The second, based on the testimony of a former police officer, shed light on the treatment of the six men during their first three days in custody, when four of them had been persuaded to confess. It was a terrifying story involving police dogs in cells, threats with shotguns and even a mock execution. In addition, I pursued a third line of inquiry: I realised from the outset that one could go on indefinitely knocking down the case against the six men, but that would only prove that the case against them was weak. To prove their innocence it would be necessary to track down the actual perpetrators and persuade some or all of them to own up in sufficient detail that it was no longer possible for those in authority to continue to assert that the right people were in custody. My first port of call was Michael Murray, who had served a 12-year sentence for involvement in terrorism offences in the West Midlands and who had long been rumoured to have been involved in the pub bombings. He was not at all keen to see me, but was eventually persuaded to do so. Murray owned up to having been one of two men who had made the bombs and also to making the warning call. He gave me a general account of the bombings. Four men had been involved, two had made the bombs and two had planted them. The targets were not the pubs, but the buildings in which they were situated: the tax office in New Street and the Rotunda next to the railway station. As with previous bombings in the West Midlands, the intention had been to give the police enough warning to evacuate the buildings, but the warning call was botched and there was insufficient time. The result was that 21 people died and 200 more suffered injuries, some of them life-changing. Murray confirmed that none of the six convicted men had been members of the IRA and none had been involved in these or any other bombings. He was, however, acquainted with two of them, who had been his workmates at a Birmingham engineering firm. I realised, however, that merely having interviewed one of the two people who had made the bombs would not demonstrate beyond doubt the innocence of the convicted men. The police never claimed to have caught those who had made the bombs. To prove the innocence of the convicted men, I would have to track down one or both of the men who had planted the bombs. I, therefore, set about finding as many as possible of those who had been planting bombs in and around Birmingham in the mid-70s. Gradually I narrowed the field to a handful of suspects and when I had the same name from three separate sources, I moved in upon him. He did not immediately admit to his role. On the night of the pub bombings he claimed to have been warned to stay at home. After a while, I said to him, “I think you were in the pubs”, and it all came tumbling out. He was the junior of two men who planted both bombs in both pubs. He had been assured there would be plenty of warning, but it all went wrong. His full story is to be found in my book, Error of Judgement. The book was published in 1986 to a mixed reception, but no one ever alleged that I had made it all up. From the West Midlands police there was silence. For many years the official police line was, “We never said we’d got all of them. Mr Mullin must have interviewed one or two who got away.” By now, however, it was becoming harder to keep the lid on. In 1987, the then home secretary, Douglas Hurd, referred the case to the court of appeal, presided over by the lord chief justice, Lord Lane. Despite a welter of new evidence he and his two colleagues sat stone-faced and at the end dismissed the appeal out of hand. “The longer this hearing has gone, the more convinced we have become that the verdict of the jury was correct,” he said, words that would come back to haunt him. In 1990 my Granada colleagues and I made the third documentary in which we interviewed the actual bomber, albeit heavily disguised. Granada also broadcast a primetime, star-studded drama documentary, Who Bombed Birmingham?, in which I was played by the actor John Hurt. In due course the Home Office ordered yet another inquiry, this one to be conducted by the chief constable of Devon and Cornwall, and he soon turned up new evidence. In particular, he located the original police notebooks and it quickly became clear that the confessions were false. The end when it came was spectacular. By now the case was a cause celebre. The six men, who had served 17 years in prison, emerged blinking into the daylight to be greeted by cheering crowds and a wall of cameras. Standing with them, facing the world’s cameras, was one of the proudest days of my life. But that was not the end of the story. Almost immediately a whispering campaign began, encouraged by people at the highest levels of the police and the legal profession. It went roughly as follows: “OK, maybe the forensic evidence was dodgy. Maybe the police did invent the confessions, but we know they did it. And if they didn’t do the pubs, they were involved in other terrorist bombings.” None of this was true. Only recently has the penny begun to drop, largely thanks to a vigorous campaign led by relatives of some of the victims. In 2018, the West Midlands police reopened the investigation, but inevitably, almost 50 years after the event, the trail has gone cold. Of the four bombers, only two are still alive. Where possible, I have cooperated with the investigation. I have, for example, handed over the notes of my interviews with Michael Murray, who died in 1999, and a redacted copy of my notes of the interview with one of the two men who planted the bombs. What I have not been willing to do, however, is to disclose his identity or those of other people I interviewed. As a result the West Midlands police applied for an order under the Terrorism Act to force me to reveal my sources. This I declined to do. Protection of sources is a cornerstone of the free press in a democracy. I entirely understand the determination of the victims’ relatives that those responsible for this atrocity should face justice. In their place I would feel the same. But when I came on the scene nobody was doing any investigating and it is mainly as a result of my investigation that the names of three of the four perpetrators are known. I interviewed a total of 16 or 17 former members of the IRA during the course of my investigation and in every case I gave absolute assurances that I would not disclose their identities. Had I not done so, no one would have talked to me. My investigation led not merely to the overturning of one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in British legal history. It resulted also in the winding up of the notorious West Midlands Serious Crime Squad and the quashing of at least 30 other convictions. In addition, it led to a royal commission that recommended, among other things, the setting up of the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which thus far has resulted in the quashing of a further 500 or so convictions, some of the latest being the scandalous cases of the post office operators who were persecuted by the Post Office. It was overwhelmingly in the public interest. I have no difficulty in justifying this. Chris Mullin was the MP for Sunderland South from 1987 to 2010. He was a minister in the Blair government and was for four years chairman of the home affairs select committee",Opinion/Opinion,"I had to keep my sources secret, or the Birmingham Six might still be in jail | Chris Mullin",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/23/birmingham-six-chris-mullin-press-freedom
