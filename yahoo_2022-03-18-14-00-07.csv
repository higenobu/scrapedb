3/18/2022,"The House of Representatives passed a bill to suspend normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus. Eight House Republicans voted against the bill on Thursday. Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz, Lauren Boebert, and Thomas Massie were among them. The House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday to suspend normal trade relations with both Russia and Belarus amid the war in Ukraine. The Suspending Normal Trade Relations with Russia and Belarus Act, which passed by a 424-8 margin, allows President Joe Biden to increase tariffs on products coming from the two countries and requires the US Trade Representative to seek suspension of Russia's participation in the World Trade Organization. The legislation must now pass the Senate and be signed by Biden to be enacted into law. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke to Congress on Wednesday to appeal for more assistance in his country's fight against Russian forces. This move comes one day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's address to Congress, and a week after the House also voted to enact tougher sanctions on Russia and ban the importation of oil from the country. Seventeen members of Congress, overwhelmingly Republicans, voted against that measure. Belarus, though not the primary aggressor in the current conflict, is a close ally of Moscow and has allowed its territory to be used by Russian troops for staging invasions. While Congress has been relatively unified in calling for Russia to be punished and for the US to support Ukraine, some on the right flank of the party have adopted a different tactic. Rep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina faced criticism from members of the GOP after he called Zelenskyy a ""thug"" at an event with constituents. Here are the eight Republicans who voted against the bill on Thursday: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona Rep. Dan Bishop of North Carolina Rep. Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin Rep. Chip Roy of Texas Most are on the right flank of the Republican Party, and are among the most loyal supporters of former President Donald Trump. Greene, for her part, bemoaned in a Thursday floor speech that ""all we're hearing on the news is Ukraine"" and claimed that ""Washington seems to care more about sending our sons and daughters to a potential war"" than more pressing domestic issues. Biden has repeatedly pledged not to send Americans troops to Ukraine. —Acyn (@Acyn) March 17, 2022 Massie told Insider in an email that ""this bill allows Biden and future Presidents to sanction virtually anyone they choose anywhere on the globe without Congressional approval,"" which he later tweeted about as well. —Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) March 17, 2022 Boebert told Insider in an email that Congress ""keeps focusing on distractions abroad and not our own challenges brought on by Joe Biden at home,"" adding that she believed the bill had ""bad language"" that could empower Biden to sanction people who ""simply hold traditional views of life and family and restrict access to abortion."" Roy told Insider via email that he would've supported the bill if targeting Russia and Belarus were the sole focus, but he took issue with the legislation because it would ""permanently empower the President with the unilateral authority to issue sanctions against anyone who he deems responsible for an undefined 'serious human rights abuse.'"" Insider has reached out to the other House Republicans' offices for comment as well.

3/18/2022,"Chris Cuomo is burning down the house. Perhaps we should stand back simply to admire the flames. On Wednesday, Cuomo asked for an arbitrator to award him $125 million because CNN fired him for what even a first-year journalism student would have understood to be egregious ethical violations. Cuomo's Trumpian-style lack of ethics is old news. But his rationale for demanding enough money to make a tech exec envious is truly novel: I wasn't the only dishonest journalist on CNN's payroll. Exhibit No. 1 for the plaintiff is Don Lemon, the CNN host whom Cuomo used to refer to as his ""brother."" (Which is rich given how quick Cuomo was to nuke journalistic ethics to bail out his brother Andrew, the former New York governor.) In November, actor Jussie Smollett testified under oath that Lemon had tipped him off that police in Chicago didn't buy his claim that a pair of MAGA-hat wearing thugs had emerged from a snowstorm to beat him up and wrap a rope around his neck. Now, in Lemon's defense, hardly anyone outside the corridors of CNN believed Smollett's saga when the fable was first told. It shouldn't have been shocking to learn that Chicago cops, who hear more credible yarns from truant eighth-graders, had their doubts. But I digress. Don Lemon's decision as a self-confessed journalist to alert Smollett that the cops were on to him was an ethical breach almost as bad as helping a politician – who just happens to be your brother – cobble together a defense against sexual harassment allegations. More from Tim Swarens: She's a hero who challenged Putin on live TV. Now she's in a Russian jail cell. “Intervening in the ongoing investigation by texting Smollett was an inexcusable breach of ethics,” Cuomo's lawyers wrote in the arbitration filing. “Yet CNN did nothing; Lemon was not disciplined in any way.” Inexcusable breach of ethics. Employer looks the other way. Cuomo knows all about such things. For Exhibit No. 2, there is Jeffrey Toobin, the news network's chief legal analyst, who was suspended by CNN in October 2020 and fired by The New Yorker after he was caught – ah, enjoying himself – during a video call with colleagues at the magazine. CNN welcomed Toobin back into the family last June despite what Cuomo's lawyers describe as a ""sordid act of sexual harassment."" Ethical violations. Sexual harassment. Chris Cuomo. Somehow these words just keep colliding. Permanent daylight saving time?: Big government better keep its hands off my watch! For Exhibit 3, Team Cuomo calls to the stand former CNN President Jeff Zucker, who resigned in February after his personal relationship with chief marketing officer Allison Gollust was disclosed. Gollust also resigned. ""As long as CNN's ratings would not be hurt, Zucker and Gollust were more than willing to overlook major transgressions by CNN personalities such as Don Lemon and Jake Tapper, or even to engage in blatant misconduct themselves,"" Cuomo's lawyers declared. Finally, Cuomo gets to the crux of it. It was, is and always will be about ratings. What's the value of an old-fashioned ethical standard or two weighed in the balance of a journalistic celebrity who can attract enough eyeballs to pay rock-star level salaries? Ukraine war diary: I grew up in Russia. Now I fight in Kyiv for Ukraine Let's be honest: On one level, CNN is the best reality TV series going. Who needs ""Desperate Housewives of Missoula"" when the Cuomo vs. Lemon vs. Zucker cage match is ready for a rumble? Yet, on another level – one I like to call the real world – the timing of Cuomo's high dive into the mud bog is sad. After all, there is a war on. I mean a real war, not the one inside CNN's C-suite. CNN's journalists have shown a masterful level of skill and professionalism – and in many cases, remarkable courage – in covering that war in Ukraine. This should be their time to both report the news without internal distractions and to receive well-deserved appreciation from their audiences and their journalistic peers. Ukraine war diary: As Russia advances, Illarion Pavliuk makes a stop en route to Kyiv Chris Cuomo has shown why it matters to call out and to evenhandedly discipline bad journalism, including ethical violations. His former CNN colleagues – along with journalists from dozens of other news outlets –have shown every day for the past three weeks why good journalism is so vitally important. Cuomo may eventually get his money. But I'll put my money on those other journalists, the ones who understand that serving their audiences' needs are far more important than serving themselves.
