2/1/2022,"Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories today.  Boris Johnson has promised to clean up his act and reform the workings of Downing Street as he attempts to shore up his premiership after Sue Gray said lockdown-era parties at No 10 were “hard to justify” amid “failures of leadership and judgment”. The prime minister ran the gauntlet of his own angry backbenchers in the Commons yesterday following the publication of a redacted version of the civil servant’s investigation into the scandal, in which she also criticised the culture of “excessive alcohol” at the heart of government. Several MPs made damaging interventions, including his predecessor, Theresa May. Despite an apology to his MPs in a private meeting at the Commons later and pledges to reform his style of government – “I get it and I will fix it,” he told them – questions about partygate could continue to dog him for months. A party in Boris and Carrie Johnson’s flat is one of 12 events now being investigated by police, and officers have been handed 300 pictures of alleged parties. The ongoing investigation means that Gray could not release her whole report. In an effort to calm backbenchers, Johnson said he would publish it in full once the police inquiry is complete. Many Conservative MPs have reached the limit of their tolerance of Johnson’s leadership – like frogs in boiling water, according to one – although the prime minister has so far avoided the string of ministerial resignations that did for May. Much will still depend on whether voters in marginal seats such as Bolton North East keep faith. One said it was a “joke” that Johnson was still in office, while a Tory councillor said the matter was still not closed. “People want answers,” she said. Some of our writers, including Nesrine Malik, Frances Ryan and Katy Balls, say what they think should happen next. Here’s how the other papers covered the dramatic day. ‘Nowhere to hide’ – Boris Johnson will try to shift the focus from parties to foreign policy when he flies to Ukraine today to meet Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky amid ongoing tension with Russia. Liz Truss was meant to go with him but will be staying at home after contracting Covid. Earlier the foreign secretary warned that key supporters of Vladimir Putin will be targeted by UK sanctions if he invades Ukraine. The Russian president’s allies would have nowhere to hide their assets if an invasion went ahead, she said. In New York, a Russian diplomat told a meeting of the UN security council that Ukraine could “destroy itself” if it disregarded peace agreements in the region. The US secretary of state, Tony Blinken, is due for talks with his counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, today. Vaccine U-turn – Sajid Javid has announced a U-turn on an order forcing all NHS staff in England to get vaccinated against Covid. The health secretary hopes the decision will prevent an exodus of much-needed staff and was made three days before Thursday’s deadline for unvaccinated NHS workers who had face-to-face contact with patients to have their first dose or be dismissed. It followed figures showing 92,000 Covid cases were reported for England on Monday, a steep rise on the day before, after reinfections were included in the statistics for the first time. MMR stalls – Amid the ongoing debate about the Covid vaccine, senior health officials in England have reported a “very worrying” fall in the number of children having the MMR vaccine, leaving thousands at increased risk of potentially deadly measles. They will launch a campaign today to rally uptake of the vaccine, which guards against measles, mumps and rubella. Between July and September last year, just 88.6% of children had had their first MMR dose by the age of two while only 85.5% had had both doses at the age of five, well short of the 95% needed to keep measles at bay. Reporting toll – Journalists in Mexico have responded with despair after the murder of a fourth reporter this year. Roberto Toledo was shot dead by three gunmen yesterday afternoon in a carpark in the city of Zitácuaro, where he reported for a local news outlet, Monitor Michoacán. “Exposing corruption led to the death of one of our colleagues,” said Armando Linares, the director of Monitor Michoacán. “We don’t carry weapons. We only have a pen and a notebook to defend ourselves.” Wordle play – The viral word game Wordle has been bought by the New York Times for an undisclosed seven-figure sum. Its creator, Reddit engineer Josh Wardle, said he was “thrilled” with the deal for the game which gives players six guesses to determine a five-letter word that changes every day. The soothing daily puzzle has become a hit since its launch, quickly attracting hundreds of thousands, then millions, of players. Sue Gray’s report into Covid lockdown rule-breaking in Downing Street has finally been published.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has passed a medical and is due to be confirmed as a Barcelona player on a free transfer from Arsenal on Tuesday morning after several hours of negotiations on deadline day. Frank Lampard marked his first day as Everton manager by signing Donny van de Beek from Manchester United and securing the audacious permanent transfer of Dele Alli from Tottenham. The latest move in golf’s global power struggle will take place on Tuesday, when the Saudi Arabian business fronted by Greg Norman reveals detailed plans for 10 events – including one in the UK – on the 2022-23 Asian Tour schedule. Formula One staff must be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 under new FIA rules that aim to avoid a Novak Djokovic-style fiasco. Scotland have been told to keep a close eye on Marcus Smith if they want to make a winning start in the Six Nations. And police have been given extra time to question the Manchester United footballer Mason Greenwood on suspicion of rape and sexual assault. The Treasury has introduced a new “super tax” to deter energy company owners from cashing out lucrative contracts for gas bought in advance before leaving their supply business to go under. The public interest business protection tax is a levy of 75% on any future windfall on contracts while leaving millions without a supplier. George Soros says falling property prices in China could turn people against Xi Jinping and even cause his downfall. On the markets the FTSE100 is set to rise around 0.5% this morning while the pound is on $1.344 and €1.197. The Telegraph splash is “PM to ask Gray for new report” in an attempt to “appease backbenchers”, while the Mail takes a similar line saying that Britain is “in limbo” and exhorting Johnson to “Now publish the whole damn thing”. The Express says “Yes PM, you got it wrong … now get it right!”, the Times’ main headline is “Police investigate PM’s four lockdown parties”, and FT says “Johnson rejects calls to quit after Gray’s scathing report on parties”. The Guardian picks a line out of the Gray report that is a theme of much of the coverage today. “‘Failures of leadership’: Tories turn on PM over Gray report”, its headline says, while the Independent just goes with ‘“Failures of leadership”’. The Metro has “A failure of leadership”, the Yorkshire Post has “‘Failures of leadership’ in parts of No10” and the Northern Echo says “Failure of leadership”. The Sun goes with “Mamma mia!”, a reference to a police investigation into an alleged Abba-themed party in the Downing Street flat on the night Dominic Cummings quit in November 2020. The Mirror’s front highlights “12 parties probed, 3 attended by PM, 1 in his own flat, 300 pictures handed over” and the main headline “Zero shame”. The Star puns with “50 Shades of Gray”.

2/1/2022,"Oti Mabuse has spoken out about the “racially abusive” and “fat-shaming” comments she received after performing on BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing. Mabuse, who has appeared as a professional on the show since 2015, said she used the abuse as fuel to carry on and show young girls that “anything is possible”.  “I’ve never really spoken about it because I’ve tried for so long to think about it this way: I work on a show that 10 million people love; if 10 or 100 people aren’t nice to me, that is not representative of everyone else’s views,” she said in the Radio Times. “To get tweeted or receive a message in my inbox being racially abusive, or fat-shaming me, is horrible. But it’s written by a person who can’t even face themselves in the mirror. “The hard stuff that I’ve been through, with the racism and discrimination, is proof that people still have a lot to learn. The more hate I receive the more of a reason it is to carry on doing my job. I have to show young girls that anything is possible. I have to fight, and be strong.” Born in South Africa, Mabuse, 31, studied civil engineering before moving to Germany to dance. The Latin American and ballroom dancer, who won the South African Latin American championship eight times, was crowned Strictly winner both in 2019 with actor Kelvin Fletcher and in 2020 with comedian Bill Bailey. Over the last year, Mabuse has taken a seat on the judging panels of BBC One’s The Greatest Dancer, ITV’s The Masked Singer and most recently, ITV’s Dancing on Ice – leading to speculation that she may not return to the Strictly ballroom. She said that growing up and moving from South Africa has remained difficult, however. “When you do something good, it’s not good enough because you’re black. Some people say you’re on a show because the channel needs to tick a box. Which means you’re not worthy of being there. But I think that just shows where people who make those comments are in their own lives. Being black makes me special.” Her new BBC radio show, Oti Mabuse’s Dancing Legends, explores the extraordinary people who have changed the course of dance, including Fred Astaire and Raven Wilkinson. Mabuse said her sister Motsi, also a dancer and Strictly judge, was her own “dancing legend”. The show, she added, was partly inspired by Bill Bailey, who taught her to “go back in time and find the root of the purpose of what you’re doing”. She also emphasised the power of dance to push boundaries, pointing to last year’s Strictly competitors, Rose Ayling-Ellis and Giovanni Pernice, and John Whaite and Johannes Radebe as proof of that point (Ayling-Ellis was the first deaf contestant on the show, and Whaite and Radebe the first all-male couple).",Arts/Television & radio,Strictly star Oti Mabuse speaks out over racist abuse and fat-shaming ,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/01/strictly-star-oti-mabuse-speaks-out-over-racist-abuse-and-fat-shaming
2/1/2022,"Treasury officials have quietly introduced a new “super tax” to deter energy company owners from cashing out lucrative contracts for gas bought in advance before leaving their supply business to go under. The government quickly pushed through the new laws late last week to counter industry concerns that Stephen Fitzpatrick, the founder of Ovo Energy, could use his almost two-thirds stake in the company to liquidate its long-term gas contracts and exit the supply market with a hefty profit.  Energy industry sources believe this loophole may have already been used by BP, which owned almost a quarter of Pure Planet before pulling the plug on the challenger brand last October. It is understood to have sold the energy it bought in advance, using the profit to pay back loans to BP. Under the government’s new super-levy, called the public interest business protection tax, a 75% tax will be imposed on any future windfall that an energy company shareholder could hope to make by cashing out gas contracts while leaving millions without a supplier. Many of the suppliers that have gone bust did not have long-term energy contracts, known as hedges, in place. However, those that did buy gas in advance, before markets reached record highs last year, have found the value of the contracts has rocketed. Ovo Energy said the new levy had its support, and that it had “been clear for some time that action was needed” to help protect households and taxpayers. The Guardian understands that the tax was ushered in to block any financial incentive for energy company owners to make a fortune off the loophole, and to provide a “safety net” for household bill payers and the public purse that would otherwise have to bail out customers left behind. Consumers in England, Scotland and Wales could already be on the hook for a total of £3.2bn to cover the cost of finding a new supplier for the 2 million households affected by the collapse of energy suppliers since the start of September, and for the further 1.7 million customers of Bulb Energy, who have been handed to a special administrator appointed to handle the large-scale collapse. Treasury documents said there was “a potential risk” that some energy suppliers and their shareholders might monetise large profits on assets such as hedges “for their own benefit, leaving the government and ultimately the wider public to be landed with the costs of ensuring the continuity of supplies of energy to customers”. “The government considers it unacceptable that, whilst consumers across the UK face rising energy bills, it would be possible for some companies and their shareholders to exploit this situation to the detriment of taxpayers and end consumers,” the documents added. A spokesperson for Ovo Energy said: “We support this, and other recent announcements intended to strengthen the resilience of the UK energy retail market.”However, the company added that it was “still not clear on what – if anything – the government will do to help support vulnerable customers” ahead of the looming hike to the UK’s energy cap which is expected next week. Energy bills are expected to soar to almost £2,000 a year from April under the regulator’s energy price cap – up from an average of £1,277 this winter – in the steepest bill increase since the cap was introduced in 2019. The government has been in talks to soften the blow to households but no measures have been agreed. “We hope this announcement is a sign of further initiatives to come to resolve the current energy crisis,” the Ovo spokesperson said.",News/Business,New ‘super tax’ to deter energy firm owners from gas profiteering,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/01/new-super-tax-to-deter-energy-firm-owners-from-gas-profiteering
2/1/2022,"Authorities in Cyprus are being urged to launch a fresh inquiry into a gang rape complaint by a British woman after the country’s supreme court acquitted her of fabricating the claim that she had been sexually assaulted at a holiday resort. The 21-year-old’s legal team said it was incumbent on the island’s police force to reopen the investigation in the wake of the landmark ruling. “It’s our next big battle,” said the human rights lawyer Nicoletta Charalambidou.  The three-member tribunal threw out the case on Monday, acknowledging that the Briton had not been given a fair trial. The verdict was announced two years after the then teenager was found guilty of making up the gang rape allegation and handed a suspended four-month sentence for fomenting public mischief. Michael Polak, who had coordinated the appeal against the conviction as head of the legal aid group Justice Abroad, told the Guardian it was critical a new investigation be initiated if justice was to be properly rendered as the initial inquiry had breached standards. “Cypriot authorities now have a duty to properly investigate the rape complaint because it is clear that was never done,” he said. “We want the investigation to be transferred to a different police force so that all the evidence in this case can be considered fairly and dispassionately.” The verdict, he said, had been achieved “against the odds.” Persefoni Panayi, the British-born president of the supreme court, had upheld the appeal in favour of the conviction being dropped, although jurists were divided, with one voting against. The Derbyshire student, who is attending university in the UK, had described in detail how she was gang-raped by up to 12 Israelis in a hotel room in Ayia Napa in July 2019. She had threatened to go to the European court of human rights if the bid to clear her name failed. The guilty verdict, handed down by the district court judge Michalis Papathanasiou, had hinged on the Briton allegedly admitting that she had falsified her original complaint. Her defence team had argued that the handwritten confession, which formed the basis of the prosecution case, was extracted under duress, in the absence of a lawyer, or translator, after more than seven hours of police questioning. Papathanasiou had repeatedly refused to allow the defendant, as she stood in the dock, to speak about the assault, saying: “This is not a rape trial.” The retraction allowed the alleged assailants, who were aged between 15 and 22 and included the sons of senior Israeli officials, to return home immediately. The woman’s status changed overnight, from victim to suspect, and she spent four weeks in Nicosia general prison before being ordered to remain on the Mediterranean island for court proceedings that would drag on for six months. The student, who has never been publicly named, was not in Nicosia to hear the news on Monday. Her lawyers described her as still being too traumatised to travel. But in a statement, her mother responded to the outcome, saying: “It is a great relief we hear that the authorities in Cyprus have recognised the flaws in their legal process. Whilst this decision doesn’t excuse the way she was treated by the police, the judge or those in authority, it does bring with it the hope that my daughter’s suffering will at least bring positive changes in the way victims of crime are treated.”",News/UK news,Cypriot police urged to reinvestigate gang rape of British woman,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/01/cypriot-police-urged-to-reinvestigate-gang-of-british-woman
2/1/2022,"Rob Piper’s world is grey, blue and black. The early morning sky is an inky blue-black as Piper drives his 44-tonne, 12-wheeled DAF XF lorry out of the Nursling industrial estate in Southampton. At this time of day – 6am – the endless grey roads consist mainly of lorries. Their metal bullbars flash a friendly smile in the halogen glare of each other’s headlights.  After endless loops of concrete motorway, Piper finishes driving mid-afternoon. Lorry drivers used to do 16- or 18-hour shifts, but now they are monitored by a digital tachograph card; Piper inserts his into a slot above the dashboard. It records all the lorry’s data: speed, distance travelled, breaks taken, total driving hours. Piper may drive for a maximum of nine hours a day and he must take a 45-minute break after four and a half hours. He can work a maximum of 60 hours a week. (In normal circumstances, drivers can work for only 56 hours a week, but the government has extended this temporarily due to a shortage of drivers.) The data goes to his employer, the haulage firm Youngs, which has to produce it on request to the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency, the government body that checks compliance. The law is strict, with good reason. “You’re driving a killing machine,” says Piper. Long-distance lorry driving has a narcoleptic effect, especially after lunch. Lorry drivers swap photos of bad accidents like trading cards. Piper was sent a particularly graphic one recently. In it, a lorry half-hangs from a motorway bridge. He shuddered when he saw it. The run-up to Christmas is always a wearying time for the UK’s lorry drivers, but 2021 was exceptionally busy. All year, the haulage industry struggled with vacancies, mostly down to an exodus of European drivers after Brexit, but also because of Covid. It is estimated that there is a shortage of more than 85,000 drivers in the UK. Those who remain have been left to pick up the slack. “We’re seeing chronic staff shortages,” says Rod McKenzie, the managing director for policy at the Road Haulage Association. “And we have an ageing driver population. When you have an ageing population of workers and they’re not being refreshed by younger people, you’re in a bad place.” Youngs has lost many drivers; all the haulage companies have. About 20 of its 40 drivers across four depots returned to EU countries, including Romania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Bulgaria, post-Brexit. To retain staff, pay has risen by about 30% across the sector. “To be perfectly candid, drivers’ wages needed to go up,” says Rob Hollyman, a director at Youngs. “They were kept low by the consumer demanding cheap prices and so costs were cut everywhere.” Even with these pay increases, drivers have left to work for the supermarkets, which typically offer higher wages; some supermarket drivers are paid more than £53,000 a year. But Piper isn’t tempted. It is difficult work, with multiple drop-offs throughout the day, and you have to work weekends. Piper prefers to have some time at home with his wife and their three dogs, Tilly, Lulu and Bella. From Monday to Friday, Piper is alone, with only the ashes of his chihuahua, Toby, for company. Toby swings from the roof of the cab in a small felt bag, with a heart embroidered on it. “He’s with me all the time, that little man,” he says. The best bit of Piper’s week is Friday afternoon, when he gets back and the dogs jump all over him, jealous for his attention. On the road again … Piper sets off from Southampton for an 11am delivery in Swindon. Piper is old enough to remember how things were before the tachograph cards (the 59-year-old has been a driver for 33 years). There was no heating in winter, nor air-conditioning in summer; no kettles or fridge-freezers or curtains to block out the sun. The engine was so loud that the seat shook. (Piper is partially deaf; his doctor says it is because of the job.) The lorries were manual and the rubber housing around the gear stick always had holes in it, which drivers would bind with jumpers to stop the cold coming in. (All newer models, including Piper’s, are automatic.) There were no beds in the cab, so drivers slept across the seats at night. They never wore seatbelts. Many still don’t. When asked, Piper says that things are better now, safer, and he means it. But in his heart he prefers how things were before – before the tachograph cards, the medical he must pass every three years, the 35 hours of training every five years to renew his Driver Certificate of Professional Competence, all of which he has to pay for from his £700-a-week wages. “Before, you got in a truck and drove,” Piper says. “Now, you’re dictated on the hours you can do, and where you can go, and what you can do. There’s just no fun in it any more.” But these restrictions demonstrably work: lorry driving is safer than it was a decade ago. There were 54 deaths of goods-vehicle occupants, a category that includes large- and heavy-goods vehicles, in 2020, down 13% from 2010. Monday to Friday, when he is out on the road, Piper sleeps in his lorry. If he is unlucky, he has to park wherever he can. Industrial estates are usually OK: there are toilets and security gates, meaning Piper doesn’t have to worry about thieves siphoning off his diesel or jacking open the back of the vehicle and making off with his cargo. If he is very unlucky, he has to pull over in a layby. He sleeps badly on those nights, waking at the slightest noise. But today, an unexceptional Monday in early October, Piper is lucky. He ends up at Eling Wharf in Southampton, where Youngs rents space for its drivers. There are toilets and showers, as well as a small office in a repurposed shipping container, painted blue, with a kettle, a fridge and a microwave. Piper drinks tea and looks out across the industrial estate. He sees a dishwater sky reflected in brackish puddles around the site. He sees workmen preparing tomorrow’s loads and carrying out maintenance on a vehicle. Without its trailer, the lorry seems exposed, like a great metal crab missing its carapace. By now, 4pm, what little light remains is mud-coloured. The waiting game … with delays in Swindon holding up the unloading of his delivery, Piper takes the opportunity to check his calendar and rest his eyes. After Piper has finished his dinner, he returns to his lorry. He climbs six feet into the cab, which is immaculately clean. He takes off his boots and leaves them on the step, careful to shut them in when he closes the door, so they don’t fall out. He closes the curtains across the windscreen and undresses. He puts the heating on. He calls his wife, to let her know that he is OK. He always speaks to her twice a day, at 12.30pm and 7.30pm. She worries otherwise. Afterwards, he lies across the single bed behind the seats and turns on the flatscreen TV at the end of his bed. He likes having the TV on – it feels like company. He watches Emmerdale first, then Coronation Street and EastEnders. By Corrie, Piper is usually half-asleep. By EastEnders, he is definitely asleep. As he sleeps, the tachograph uploads his data for the day. The computer floods the cab with a bright light that other drivers complain about, but Piper is used to it; he doesn’t stir. Staff shortages aren’t confined to the drivers. More often than not, when Piper arrives at his destination, there are no workers available to unload his cargo. On another Monday later in October, Piper drives from Southampton to Birmingham with a full cargo of baby car seats. He gets to the warehouse at 11am, as requested; Piper takes pride in his job and is rarely late. There are no staff available to empty the lorry. Piper waits until 2pm, but there are still no staff free, so he returns to Southampton. Man’s best friend … the ashes of Piper’s chihuahua, Toby, hang in his cab. He drives back the next day and waits all afternoon. Still no staff. He spends the night in Birmingham, meaning that the firm has to pay demurrage, the fee set after the three-hour window for unloading has expired. There is a kebab van on the industrial estate where he is sleeping, which he considers, but, on account of his diabetes, Piper makes do with a microwaveable hot pot. Finally, on Wednesday, the car seats are unloaded and Piper goes back to Southampton. This is the life of a lorry driver: endless waiting. Piper waits at Southampton docks to be assigned to a loading bay. He waits for his trailer – or box, as he calls it – to be lifted on to his lorry by a straddle carrier, a freight-carrying vehicle that looks like a giant stamp. He waits at his destination for his cargo to be unloaded. When he started, the waiting irritated him. “You get used to it,” he says. While he waits, Piper flicks through his favourite truck magazines: Commercial Motor; Truck & Driver. Sometimes he naps, although he always wakes up when he feels the lorry is almost empty; he can tell from how it shifts on the wheels. He speaks on his phone to his friends at work – Piper calls them the container boys. (Lorry driving is an overwhelmingly male profession: of the 315,000 registered HGV drivers in the UK, just 2,200 are female.) There is Alan, on whom Piper likes to play practical jokes, and Lloyd, who is obsessed with unusual food innovations: jam-flavoured teabags, lemon drizzle digestive biscuits, roast potato crisps. Lorry drivers tend to speak about one of five things: routes, traffic, schedules, other drivers and food. If Piper discovers a useful titbit – perhaps a bakery he likes to stop at has closed down, or a client told him something interesting as they were unloading his lorry – he passes it on to Alan and Lloyd carefully for inspection, like a piece of ancient pottery at a dig. “There is a lorry-driver grapevine,” Piper says. This camaraderie – the inane, meandering chats – makes the job tolerable. Lorry driving is lonely work and the job has an emotional price. “I know I missed my kids growing up,” says Piper, who has three children and five grandchildren. “I only saw them weekends.” October passes in a bleary circuit of motorway service stations and harried clients who complain about shipping costs and staff shortages. And then, at 6.07am on 11 November, a rent in the fabric of Piper’s everyday life. A 54-year-old cyclist dies after colliding with a lorry at the entrance to Southampton docks, causing tailbacks all day. Through conversations with the other boys in the yard, Piper gleans the particulars of the crash: the spot where the cyclist became affixed to the lorry; the stretch of road along which he was dragged; and the place where the driver made his grisly discovery. Southampton docks are the beating heart of the south coast’s haulage operation. Here, gleaming cars, children’s toys and electrical appliances arrive from all over the world via inconceivably huge container ships. They are then carried by lorry on the M3, north-east to London, or the A31, westwards to Totnes, or the A34, north to Stoke-on-Trent. The container boys … Piper has a cup of tea with his friend Alan (top) and catches up with another colleague. But, in the past 18 months, Southampton docks have often been congested. When Piper drives into the docks, they are backed up. He might wait there for two, even three, hours. The delays are worst in the afternoon. As he waits for his box to be loaded on to his lorry, Piper speaks to Alan and Lloyd on the phone. They gripe about the delays and wonder if it is down to Covid-induced staff shortages, as people are off sick and self-isolating. To make matters worse, fuel prices have increased by nearly 20%. In June 2021, Youngs paid 99p a litre for fuel; by December, it was £1.17. “We have to pass it on to the consumer,” says Hollyman. “We have no other option.” (No one has managed to manufacture an electric HGV lorry, because of the fuel power needed to pull heavy loads, while the UK is not, in general, well set up for rail freight.) Late in November, the lorry-driver grapevine yields more fruit. Three curtain-side lorries have their loads stolen during the night at Fleet services, on the M3 near Basingstoke, Hampshire. The trailers on curtain-side lorries are covered only by sheets of tarpaulin, affixed with ropes, which are easy to cut through. Piper hates driving curtain-side vehicles for this reason, especially around Christmas, when thieves surmise, correctly, that the lorries are full of valuable goods. Piper was robbed six years ago, in the middle of the night. They took £180,000 worth of clothes. He felt the vehicle moving, but thought it was because of the soft ground on which he was parked, as well as the vibrations from passing traffic. Something felt off, though, so he pulled back the curtain on the passenger side of the cab. A man was standing there. He put one finger on his lips and slid another across his throat. Ten accomplices unloaded the van. Piper called the police, but they said there was nothing they could do. Afterwards, a doctor signed him off work for a week and prescribed him anti-anxiety medication. “It frightened me to bits,” he says. The stress is constant. “It’s always in the back of your mind,” he says. “Where will I park? Will I be safe? When I wake up, I look out of my mirrors to see if there’s anyone around. I don’t want to go through that again. We’re targets all the time.” Many industrial estates are painted with double yellow lines, so lorry drivers are forced to park in laybys, where they sleep fitfully, fearful of being attacked and robbed. “People want their goods, but they don’t want you to park anywhere,” says Piper. “It’s horrible.” Home from home … unlike in the old days, Piper’s cab is fitted with a bed, a TV and heating. It is for this reason that the sector struggles to recruit staff, says McKenzie. “Conditions are poor,” he says. “There’s very little safe and secure lorry parking. There are few gold-standard lorry parks. And drivers are fed up with it.” In October, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced £32.5m in funding for roadside facilities. “It costs around £40m to build a brand new lorry park, so he’s talking about upgrades to existing parks,” says McKenzie. “But when you see some of the parks we’ve got, they need a lot more than a brush-up.” This is the stuff that really grinds down Piper, that makes him wish there was something else he could do. This and the lack of respect. Most clients are polite, but some can be awful. They refuse to let Piper use the toilets, or berate him for being late, even if he has explained that it is not his fault the docks were backed up. During the first lockdown, things were different. Families waved at him from motorway bridges. “We were loved by the public because we delivered everything,” he says. “Now that it’s over, we get treated dreadfully. But if it wasn’t for us, you wouldn’t have the clothes on your back. The food in your house. Your car.” A man once came to Piper’s house, in a village near Andover in Hampshire. He was campaigning against a distribution depot that a supermarket was planning to build nearby. He told Piper: “We don’t want lorries coming through here.” Piper was appalled. “I said: ‘Hold on, I’m a lorry driver. I’m fed up with people saying they don’t need lorries. How do you think you get your stuff?’” By December, Piper is working punishingly long hours. At this time of year, he normally does a 13- or 14-hour shift, made up of his nine-hour drive time, but also mandatory breaks and waiting time. One Thursday morning, he has to wake up at 3.30am, in the Eling yard. Everything is dark and depressing. “It’s cold out,” he says. “You’re in there nice and warm. You pull the curtain back and look outside and think: ‘I don’t want to get up this morning.’” It is a wrench to leave his plastic-moulded bedroom, where he sleeps more soundly than he does at home. Piper brews a cup of tea, makes his bed, then walks to the shower block through the gloom. Some drivers don’t bother, but Piper is fastidious about his personal hygiene. On his return, he checks the lorry, inspecting the wipers, tyres and brakes with a torch. He does the 10-minute drive to Nursling, listening to BBC Radio 2, before finding his load, strapping it down and collecting his paperwork from the office. Then it is on to Birmingham, where he has three drops. Collections in Newbury and Basingstoke will follow. ‘You’re snacking all the time’ … Piper tucks into a sandwich and a packet of crisps. Often, his only options for lunch are fast food or ready meals. Lunch is a bacon, egg and sausage sandwich from a van in a layby outside Birmingham. He had planned to buy only a cup of tea, until he smelled the bacon. A pot belly is the lorry driver’s inheritance, like the salaryman’s gold watch or the Olympian’s medal cabinet. Lorry drivers are more likely than average to be obese, have diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, cancer, problems sleeping and musculoskeletal disorders. The average life expectancy of a male lorry driver is 76.6; for male doctors and lawyers, it is 82.5. It is the sedentary nature of the job, but also the fact that it is almost impossible to eat healthily on the road. Before, there would be truck stops, which served home-cooked meals, but most have closed down; Piper’s only options come lunchtime are usually McDonald’s, Burger King and KFC, or a salt-filled ready meal. His doctor tells him to go for a walk in the evening to get some exercise, but that is unrealistic: he can’t leave his lorry unattended. Besides, he is always knackered. Piper’s friends have had heart attacks while driving; he had a stroke in 2000 and didn’t work for 18 months. “It’s the style of life,” he says. “You sit here and you get bored. You think: I’m hungry, I’ll have a sandwich. I’ll have a bag of crisps. You’re snacking all the time. You drink tea until it comes out of your ears.” Late in December, things go mad. “Everyone wants their containers and their deliveries urgently,” says Piper. He does a job in London on a Friday. The traffic is unbelievable. It takes nearly an hour to travel 15 miles (24km) around the North Circular. By the time he gets home, it is nearly 8pm. He is working right up until Christmas. On 20 December, he drives from Southampton to Wellington in Somerset. He leaves Nursling at 6am with a cargo of wicker baskets, crammed into the back with not an inch to spare. Passing other lorry drivers, he has the feeling of being part of a pod of friendly whales. In Wellington, the client wants to talk about the supply chain crisis. His shipping container costs have gone up from $2,000 (£1,490) to $15,000 (£11,160) in just 18 months, partly due to increased labour costs since Brexit, but also due to the supply chain crisis. The client runs a garden furniture business that is foundering: just this year, he had to return a million pounds’ worth of orders, because it was impossible to import the stock. He had two containers on the Ever Given, the container ship that got stuck in the Suez canal in March 2021, disrupting global trade for months. “This is the picture across the world,” says Prof Edward Anderson, a supply chain expert at Imperial College London. Because globalised supply chains are run so efficiently, when something goes wrong – like the Ever Given – the impact can be catastrophic. The pandemic, too, has disrupted global trade. “Covid sits behind many of these disruptions,” says Anderson. “The pingdemic. People not being able to go to work.” Covid has also created an international shortage of computer chips, which has had knock-on effects for the haulage sector, as these chips are used in automobiles. Youngs should have had 12 lorries delivered in November 2021, but it received only eight. All of the major lorry manufacturers have closed their books for 2022: you can’t get a new lorry now unless you have already ordered it. As Piper waits for the client to unload the lorry, he calls Alan and then Lloyd. They chat about the traffic and their routes. Piper relays some gossip he heard from the owner of the garden centre about how he came to buy the business. Later, in the twilight of the Eling yard, Piper wrings out the story a third time for his colleague Steve. “Is that right?” Steve says. Today has been a good day. Friendly clients, no traffic. Back in Eling, Piper gets to sleep. But, as he approaches the culmination of his more than 30-year career as a lorry driver, in all honesty, Piper has regrets. He wishes he had paid attention at school, instead of bunking off every Friday to work on a milk float, and got the grades to do something else, like become a truck mechanic. “I’m a fool,” he says. “But it’s the only thing I know how to do.” ‘All I wanted to do was to drive a truck’ … Piper in his cab. Yet, when his stroke took him off the road, he was miserable. “I thought that was it,” says Piper. “My lorry-driving days were over. And my life was over, in a way.” Lorry driving is his life’s work – and his passion. “It’s sad, really,” he says. “Ever since I was at school, all I wanted to do was to drive a truck.” When Piper says that sometimes he hates being a lorry driver, what he means is that he hates how the job has changed. Piper is nostalgic for the days when lorry drivers had the freedom to drive wherever they liked, for however long they wanted, rules and regulations be damned. He has always been like this: even when he was at school. “I don’t like change,” he says. “I like things to be the way they were.” The best days, the days that really stick out, are the ones where people are kind. Ordinary human kindness takes on an outsized importance in Piper’s memory: he collects these encounters and turns them over in his mind. Take the time he was doing a house removal in Devon. It was a bucolic summer’s day. He drove through a tiny village, past cottages entwined with roses and an old man smoking a pipe. When he got to the house, it turned out he had arrived a day early, by mistake. The client was a woman in her 30s. They sat out together on the patio, chatting and drinking tea. He could hear the church bells ringing. It was lovely. But these days are rare. For the most part, lorry drivers are treated with disdain. Motorists cut them up. Nimbys campaign against proposed lorry parks, as if drivers should not be able to eat and sleep in comfort and safety. Environmentalists shudder at the emissions, while wearing clothes and eating food conveyed to them by lorry. “Lorry drivers are essential workers,” says McKenzie. “We told them that during Covid. But we have not done a lot as a nation to back that up.” There are so many people like Piper, all over the country. They bring everything from our fuel to our medical supplies and, for the most part, they do it quietly, without recognition. “Lorry drivers are the forgotten side of the supply chain jigsaw,” says Anderson. “Consumers see the last mile and the people who deliver parcels to our front doors. But they don’t necessarily see the lorry drivers.” After an exhausting week, Piper drives home on Christmas Eve, past houses where all the presents – and the turkey – arrived via lorry. He lets himself in. The dogs jump all over him, mad with excitement. A few days’ respite before Piper starts up the engine again.

2/1/2022,"When Boris Johnson addressed MPs an hour after the release of Sue Gray’s redacted report, he will have hoped his apology would travel far beyond the Commons chamber and reached places like Tonge Fold, on the outskirts of Bolton. But the immediate reaction suggests the prime minister might be in trouble. “It’s just extremely disappointing and very frustrating. There’s no other words for it,” said Adele Warren, a Conservative councillor, after watching Johnson’s Commons statement with some of her party colleagues.  “I’m a Conservative because I have Conservative values,” she said. “However, that doesn’t mean that I will blindly endorse acts that I think aren’t honourable, and I don’t think these actions have been honourable.” Warren, a cabinet member responsible for regeneration on Bolton council, said she now believed Johnson should resign. His premiership risked damaging the Conservatives in the upcoming local elections, she added. “I do think it has the potential to be extremely damaging for the local elections. “It’s really sad because Brexit is finally sorted, no matter how you felt about it; the vaccination rollout was brilliant; the way the economy didn’t tank … [but] unfortunately I don’t think you can have a mandate built on trust and respect when there’s a report like that.” Tonge Fold is a white working-class community in the constituency of Bolton North East, a former Labour stronghold won by the Conservatives in the 2019 election. It has the thinnest majority of all the red wall seats won by the Conservatives – just 378 votes – and its MP, Mark Logan, has been publicly critical of the prime minister over the “partygate” saga. So febrile was the atmosphere in Westminster last week that Logan used a live interview with Sky News to dispel rumours that he was preparing to defect to Labour. Days earlier he had told the television cameras: “The PM has a lot of convincing to do because I and my constituents are not convinced at the moment.” Around the corner from Logan’s constituency office, Angelika Searle was digesting the Gray report before the teatime rush at her Bavarian bakery, Pretzel & Spelt. “You just can’t have different rules in Downing Street. It’s appalling,” she said. “You see Queen Elizabeth doing the right thing, following the rules, sitting alone, and it seems that none of these rules were applicable to the government itself.” Tommy Maloney, 30, said he was “fuming” to learn that government figures were attending lockdown-busting parties at a time when he could not visit his vulnerable mother or grandmother or properly celebrate birthdays and Christmas. “My gran is 84 and I wasn’t allowed to see her for her birthday and then we see the people in charge were on the piss? It’s a joke.” His friend Chris James, 31, said he had not been able to see his seven-year-old daughter for months due to the restrictions on households mixing. Boltonians have lived with some form of restrictions for most of the last 22 months, due to the enduringly high transmission rates in the town. “We’ve been locked down for nearly two years, we’ve gone through our savings, and the puppeteers can just do what they want,” James said. The mood was not unanimously bleak for Johnson, however. One shopkeeper, who refused to give her name in case her customers read the Guardian, said it was “a disgrace” that the prime minister’s critics were “sticking the knife in” and insisted he had done a good job handling the pandemic. “Leave him a-bloody-lone, for Christ’s sake,” she said. At AllBreeds pet shop, owner Denise Williams said she was not angry about partygate because “deep down I don’t think we should’ve had those rules for everybody anyway”. As the controversy rumbles on, with an ongoing police investigation and the full details of the Gray report yet to be revealed, it will be the views of party members in seats like Bolton North East that will worry Johnson the most. Warren, the Conservative councillor, said Gray’s initial findings called for a “drastic change” to the culture – and the occupants – of No 10: “The police investigation is right, but the way it’s been handled isn’t fair. There needs to be repercussions from it. People want answers.”",News/Politics,‘People want answers’: Boris Johnson’s apology lands flat with Bolton’s swing voters,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/01/people-want-answers-boris-johnsons-apology-lands-flat-with-boltons-swing-voters
2/1/2022,"Thousands of children face an increased risk of catching deadly measles in England, senior health officials have warned, as “very worrying” figures reveal MMR vaccine rates have fallen to their lowest level in a decade. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and the NHS will launch a joint appeal on Tuesday urging parents and guardians to ensure their children have had their measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccines – as well as other routine jabs – before starting school.  Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, there has been “a significant drop” in the number of children getting MMR jabs and other childhood vaccines, UKHSA said. Between July and September last year, the most recent figures available, just 88.6% of children had had their first MMR dose by the age of two while only 85.5% had had both doses at the age of five. It means that more than one in 10 children aged five are not up to date with their two doses of MMR vaccine. The World Health Organization (WHO) says 95% of children need to be vaccinated to keep measles away. Measles is highly contagious so even a small decline in MMR uptake could lead to a rise in cases, UKHSA said. With international travel resuming, it is also more likely that measles will be brought in from countries that have higher levels of the disease. “Even a small drop in vaccine coverage can have a big impact on population immunity levels and lead to outbreaks,” said Dr Vanessa Saliba, a consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA. Measles can lead to complications such as ear infections, pneumonia, and inflammation of the brain, which require hospitalisation and on rare occasions can lead to long-term disability or even death. “It is very worrying that more than one in 10 children are not fully protected against measles by the time they start school,” said Prof Helen Bedford, professor of children’s health at the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health. “There has been so much focus on Covid over the past two years, but we mustn’t forget about measles, which has not gone away.” All children are invited for their first MMR vaccine on the NHS aged one, with the second dose given when they are three years and four months. The NHS says it has continued to prioritise routine vaccinations throughout the pandemic. However, some parents whose children haven’t been vaccinated against MMR have said they didn’t realise the NHS was still offering appointments, or they didn’t want to burden the NHS, according to UKHSA. Separate research commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care and UKHSA, conducted by Censuswide, shows many parents are unaware of the risks measles poses to their unvaccinated children. Of 2,000 parents and guardians of children aged five or under surveyed, almost half (48%) were unaware measles can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia and brain inflammation. Just four in 10 (38%) were aware that measles can be fatal. Dr Nikki Kanani, medical director for primary care at NHS England, said: “It is incredibly important that all parents and guardians ensure their child is up to date with their routine vaccinations, including MMR, as these vaccines give children crucial protection against serious and potentially deadly illnesses and stop outbreaks in the community. “If your child has missed a vaccination, please contact your GP practice to book an appointment as soon as you can to make sure they have maximum protection against disease.”",News/Society,‘Very worrying’: MMR vaccine rates in England at 10-year low,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/01/very-worrying-mmr-vaccine-rates-in-england-at-10-year-low

2/1/2022,"One of the world’s smallest countries, with a total area of just 54 sq km, the British overseas territory of Bermuda lies in the western Atlantic Ocean, 1,000 km east of North Carolina in the US. At a latitude of 32 degrees north of the equator, Bermuda has a subtropical climate, which combined with its oceanic position means there is not much variation in temperature between summer and winter. Summer maximums usually peak at about 30C, though occasionally range into the high 30s; in winter, they are around the low 20s, falling to the mid-teens at night.  Humidity is generally high, especially at the height of summer, again thanks to Bermuda being surrounded by ocean; and rainfall is fairly high, with an annual total of just over 1,400 mm (55 inches) – comparable with parts of western Britain. However, the rain tends to be concentrated in downpours, so sunshine levels are also high, with five or six hours a day in winter and up to 10 hours a day in summer. With mostly guaranteed sunshine and warmth, it is little wonder that Bermuda is such a popular holiday destination for elderly Americans, often sporting the country’s signature long and baggy shorts. But they might wish to avoid visiting in the late summer and early autumn, when the remnants of hurricanes or tropical storms from further south can bring unsettled and windy weather.",News/News,Weatherwatch: year-round sunshine in subtropical Bermuda,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/01/weatherwatch-year-round-sunshine-in-subtropical-bermuda
2/1/2022,"For 75 years, no firm has embodied the ethos of casually upscale California design quite like Heath Ceramics. Founded immediately after the second world war by Edith Heath, a largely self-taught ceramicist and potter, the company revolutionized domestic ceramics, transforming the art form from stuffy tea sets to versatile, modern dinnerware. Now, a new exhibition in Oakland marks the first-ever solo exhibition of Heath’s career, celebrating Heath as a ceramicist, a chemist and an entrepreneur, one whose half-century career helped establish California as a site of mid-century modernism while elevating ceramics as a genre.  “I think of her as an alchemist,” said Drew Johnson, the curator of photography and visual culture at the Oakland Museum of California (OMCA), where the exhibition is taking place. Johnson says that Heath’s playful style was the key to her experimental and ultimately revolutionary approach. “I think it comes from the idea that she was largely self-taught,” he says. “Most of her investigations into ceramic chemistry and glaze and the whole process of developing a clay body from raw clay into something she wanted — it was from her private experimentation, which was really rigorous.” OMCA has been continuously displaying pieces of her work since its founding in the 1960s but the exhibition is its first to tackle a retrospective of Heath’s work. Juxtaposing vintage ashtray ads and vitrines full of low-rimmed Heath bowls, with illustrations of Heath’s fascination with the properties of clays found in the Sierra Nevada foothills, the show builds a portrait of a postwar Renaissance woman unafraid to upend notions of what ceramics could be. Born into a Danish American family in Ida Grove, Iowa, in 1911, Heath moved to California when her husband Brian took a job with the Red Cross. Barely two years after she took her first ceramics class, she’d already won her first solo show at San Francisco’s Legion of Honor, a success that she quickly parlayed into her own factory. Based in Sausalito, an affluent and historically artsy enclave just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco, Heath Ceramics has long functioned on the same anti-aristocratic principles as the 1920 Bauhaus, using scientific principles to make design accessible to California’s burgeoning middle class. Some 75 years later, its quality and beauty may be all but universally beloved, but Heath has always had to reckon with a tension between idealism and price. “Her stuff is expensive,” Johnson concedes. “It’s not cheap. And yet she was very public in saying she was an egalitarian designer, making works for [a?] a casual lifestyle that was informal and not for the elite. She would admit, ‘Yes, my stuff costs a little more than other people’s, but it will last a lifetime.” She never ceased tinkering. Fascinated by eutectics, the science of mixing various metals into clay to alter its properties, the Heaths would drive around the West Coast, gathering buckets of native clays to take home and experiment with. This stood in stark contrast to the craft’s centuries-long use of white clay, most of it imported. “We do try to make the point of Edith as a rebel with the rejection of what had been traditionally used to make fine dinnerware,” Johnson says. “She said, ‘No, I’m going to use these native clays that evoke the landscape.’” A product of the decomposed granite that makes up the Sierra, the hardy native clay had mostly been used for industrial applications, like pipes. Their ability to withstand high heat appealed to Heath, as did manganese, the metal that gives Heath pieces their signature speckles. Initially, her work earned little love from the establishment. Its commercial allure – the upmarket San Francisco department store Gump’s was an early champion – offended what Johnson calls “arts potters.” Heath was also fundamentally agnostic on the merit of mechanical versus hand production, and her insistence that manufactured pieces developed from a handmade prototype could be just as aesthetically excellent as handmade pieces generated so much mutual antipathy that she was asked to leave the San Francisco Potters’ Association. But as the years passed, her ideas and aesthetics proved ahead of their time. Today Heath plates and cups are staples at many Bay Area restaurants, as much a part of California’s vaunted food culture as seasonal produce. The exhibition’s clearest demonstration of ceramics before and after Edith Heath comes in a side-by-side comparison of her family’s china with some of her own work. The former are bone-white and strikingly old fashioned, including a delicate, poppy-patterned teacup and saucer that look as though they belong in a well-to-do Midwestern farmer’s parlor. Heath’s early Coupe Line, by contrast, has a warm hue and an oven-friendly durability that evokes the evolution of public taste from Wonder Bread to artisanal, sourdough loaves. As her career progressed, Heath moved into tile and building materials, winning industrial-design awards for her experiments. After a 1991 firestorm in Oakland killed 25 people and destroyed thousands of homes, she developed new ideas for fire-resistant construction. By the time she died, in 2005, tastemakers had once again embraced the simple elegance of Heath’s aesthetic. As “A Life in Clay” proves, it remains an essential component of the Golden State’s relationship with postwar modernism – a key element of California living, baked in a kiln. Edith Heath: A Life in Clay, is on at the Oakland Museum of California from 29 January - 30 October 2022.

2/1/2022,"When the Danish film-maker Jonas Poher Rasmussen was 15, an Afghan refugee moved to his small village. Rumours circulated about how the boy, Amin, had got there. Some said he had walked all the way from Kabul, others that he had seen his whole family slaughtered. Rasmussen became the newcomer’s friend and confidant – Amin even came out to him as gay when they were teenagers – and their closeness endured into adulthood. When they both suffered bad break-ups in their 20s, for instance, Rasmussen went to stay with Amin; they refer to that period now as “the heartbreak summer”. He still didn’t know the truth about how his friend came to Denmark, though, so he did what any documentarist might do: he proposed making a film about him. Amin refused to reveal his identity on screen – but what if the film were animated? The result is Flee, which alternates between scenes of Rasmussen interviewing his friend, dramatisations of Amin’s perilous journey to Copenhagen via Moscow, and present-day interludes showing him househunting with his boyfriend in which the concept of settling down presents unique challenges for someone who has spent his life running. Aside from the occasional excerpt of archive footage – the war-scarred streets of Kabul, the unruly waves seen from a boat smuggling people across the Baltic – every frame of the movie is animated, most of it in a simple, straightforwardly realistic fashion that matches Amin’s narration.  “Fundamentally, everything came from his testimony,” says the 40-year-old director. We are speaking via video call just before Christmas, at the end of a year that began with Flee (which is executive-produced by Riz Ahmed and the Game of Thrones star Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) winning the Grand Jury prize in the documentary section at Sundance. “It had to be a style of animation that supported what Amin said. It also had to represent authentically the streets of Kabul and Moscow in the 1980s rather than being stylised or otherworldly.” When Amin frolics as a child in his sister’s dresses or bops happily to the sound of A-ha, the mood is bright and buoyant. In moments of trauma, the animation grows nightmarish: faces appear without features, surroundings become scratchy and abstract. “Again, that came from the voice. When Amin started to talk about trauma, he spoke more slowly and incoherently. I knew we needed to see that reflected in the animation. It’s not about the reality any more, it’s about the emotion inside, the anger and fear.” Flee provides harrowing glimpses into the refugee experience but in places the movie is playful and funny. The young Amin, a devout fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme, imagines his idol winking at him in the middle of a fight scene from Bloodsport. Later, when Amin is squashed next to a dishy older man while being driven in a van by people smugglers, the soundtrack (Joyride by Roxette) seems to be expressing his taboo desires. The partial disguise of animation gives Amin, who is hiding behind an assumed name as well as a cartoon face, a way to tell his story in full for the first time. “He didn’t want people to pity him, or to see him only as a refugee,” Rasmussen explains. It’s impossible not to notice, though, that Amin isn’t the only person whose appearance has been altered on screen. The film-maker talking to me today looks nothing like the one who is shown interviewing his friend in Flee. “Ah, my non-blondness,” he says sheepishly, gesturing to his dark hair and beard. “I wanted to create a contrast between Amin and me so that people weren’t confused.” It also reflects the story’s unreliable nature, where rumour and subterfuge are gradually peeled away to reveal the truth. “What we’re seeing on screen doesn’t always match up with the real world.” He confesses to a more personal reason, too. “I didn’t want the audience to question where I’m from. In my own family, there is a refugee background. My maternal grandmother was born in Copenhagen but her parents, who were Jewish, had fled Russia in the pogroms. They applied for asylum here but were rejected, then moved on to Berlin. Being Jewish, my grandmother had to stand up every day in class with a yellow star on her chest. After that, they had to flee again – to England and then the US.” Rasmussen insists that he didn’t feel like an outsider himself during his childhood in Denmark, though there was one detail that set him apart. “All my friends were blond,” he says. “At 11 or 12, I wanted to be blond, too. And now I had the chance.” He looks bashful and boyish: a kid who made his wish come true. Flee was an emotional film to piece together. “I’d heard the rumours about Amin’s past so I expected it to be harrowing,” he says. “I was more surprised by how much it all still affected him. He wasn’t able to connect his past and his present so he didn’t feel like a whole person.” The most traumatic part for Rasmussen was sifting through footage from 1980s Afghanistan to find just the right snapshots of horror. “That was a tough few weeks,” he says. “I needed a lot of breaks. But we had to show that staying in Kabul was not an option. The kid you see lying in a pool of blood represents Amin if he had stayed.” In Rasmussen’s previous film, the live-action documentary What He Did, he used a different sort of framework to address horrifying events. That film told the story of Jens Michael Schau, who brutally murdered his partner, the novelist Christian Kampmann. In that instance, the rehearsal and performance of a new play about the killing provided a lens through which to explore the story on two levels of reality, just as animation does in Flee. Both films concern gay male outsiders – Schau admits he felt “inferior” in his partner’s literary circles, while Amin describes himself as being “ashamed and embarrassed” of being a refugee. The films also feature scenes set in gay bars. “I’m definitely drawn to outsider stories, to seeing how marginalised people cope in society,” says Rasmussen. Then a grin: “I’m not drawn to gay bar scenes. It’s just a coincidence I have two of those in a row.” Are the animation and the play-within-the-film ways of holding these subjects at an analytical distance? Quite the opposite, he argues. “When you deal with stories in the past, it’s always a struggle to make them feel current again. The setting up of the play in What He Did provides a natural structure. The same with the animation in Flee. It makes it all feel like it is happening now in front of our eyes.” And it is. There will be millions more people who are displaced like Amin in the coming years and decades, not only through war but also the climate emergency. “I hope it gives a human face to these stories,” he says. “When Amin arrived in Denmark, the rhetoric around refugees wasn’t so bad. In the last 20 years, it has become increasingly toxic. I want the film to show that being a refugee is not an identity – it’s a circumstance that can happen to anyone. Yes, Amin is a refugee but he’s so much more. He is an academic, a house owner, a husband.” How is he now? “He’s very well. He’s been travelling all his life and suddenly he had to stay at home like everybody else for the past few years. But he’s enjoyed it. He sends me photos of cats, and the flowers in the garden.” Does Rasmussen feel as if he has finally understood Amin after making Flee? “I don’t think you can get to the bottom of a living person,” he says. “We’re all works in progress.

2/1/2022,"Labor says it would spend up to an extra $700m on a contentious new Snowy Hydro power plant in the New South Wales Hunter Valley to equip it to run on green hydrogen made with renewable energy instead of a fossil fuel. Speaking in the NSW town of Kurri Kurri on Tuesday, Anthony Albanese said if Labor won the upcoming federal election it would ensure the publicly funded gas-fired plant announced by the Morrison government last May could run with 30% green hydrogen blended in once it started operation next year.  The opposition leader said the Kurri Kurri plant would run entirely on hydrogen “as soon as possible”, with a goal of 2030, under a plan that would take the Coalition’s “flawed approach and make it work”. Labor’s climate change and energy spokesperson, Chris Bowen, said the party would allocate up to $700m in extra equity investment to Snowy Hydro, lifting the potential total cost from $600m to $1.3bn. He said Snowy Hydro documents indicated the 660MW plant could run 30% on hydrogen immediately, but this was not in the government’s plans. “We’ll ensure, working positively with Snowy Hydro, that will be the case,” Bowen said. Angus Taylor, the energy and emissions reduction minister, said the opposition’s plan was “economically incoherent”, and accused it of a “humiliating backflip” on the project aimed at shoring up support in the Hunter Valley, particularly in the Labor-held seats of Paterson and Hunter. Taylor said it would not yet be technically feasible to run the plant on hydrogen by 2030, and that the government’s goal was to first help bring down the cost of the fuel. He would not comment on when the plant would run on hydrogen under the Coalition. “There’s technical feasibility – and getting some hydrogen into the generator is technically feasible – (and) there’s economic feasibility, which is: who’s going to pay for it?” Albanese said Labor’s pledge would ensure a secure electricity supply while making the plant consistent with a shift to net zero emissions by 2050. “I see the Hunter as potentially a green hydrogen powerhouse for Australia and the world. Not just producing it here, but exporting it internationally,” he said. The Kurri Kurri plant was announced as part of what the Morrison government has called a “gas-fired recovery” from the pandemic. It would be a “peaking” plant, turned on only occasionally when needed at times of high demand and to fill gaps in the market. Snowy Hydro expects it will run at 2% of its full capacity annually, and to employ about 10 people once operational. Taylor has argued the Kurri Kurri plant is needed to avoid a significant increase in wholesale electricity prices when the Liddell coal-fired plant shuts in 2023, but analysts have said it is not needed to maintain electricity supply. Kerry Schott, the former head of the Energy Security Board, last year said a gas plant in the Hunter Valley did not “stack up” commercially given there were cheaper and cleaner alternatives in development. Labor argues running the plant on hydrogen will make it economically viable as it will be in use longer than gas, which releases significant emissions. It points to the billionaire Andrew Forrest’s proposal to build a 660MW gas-hydrogen generator at Port Kembla at an estimated cost of $1.3bn, including $30m in federal funding to help make it hydrogen compatible. Forrest’s company, Squadron Energy, has said the plant will be capable of running on 50% green hydrogen when first turned on, with a goal of increasing that to 100% by 2030. But analysts have questioned whether hydrogen will ever be economically competitive as a fuel to generate electricity. Michael Liebreich, the founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, ranked it as among the least viable likely uses of hydrogen. Tony Wood, energy program director with the Grattan Institute, said the Kurri Kurri plant was never necessary to ensure the electricity supply once the Liddell coal plant closed as claimed, and was likely to deter private investment, but Labor’s pledge was pragmatic given contracts were likely to be signed before the federal election, expected in May. He said moving the plant from gas to hydrogen would not reduce emissions by much given the plant would only run when needed and, depending on how hydrogen costs evolved, it could be difficult for a government to get a return on additional investment of up to $700m. “I think whether this is a good use of public funding is something they would need to think about in government,” Wood said. The Greens leader Adam Bandt said even with a non-binding pledge to use hydrogen the project remained a “terrible idea”. “Gas is as dirty as coal. This power plant is Scott Morrison’s Trojan horse for more methane gas, and now Labor is backing it too,” he said. Bruce Robertson, a gas market analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said Labor had made a “cynical political decision that is not based on economics or the delivery of electricity to the Australian people at the cheapest possible cost”. “This project is poorly located on a gas line that cannot even supply it with sufficient gas and is now proposed to be powered by hydrogen, a technology that’s unproven and whose costs are unknown,” he said. “Make no mistake this is a decision based purely on politics and is not in the best interests of the Australian people.” Fiona Lee, from the Gas Free Hunter Alliance, said “not a single cent of public money” should be spent on a project using fossil fuels. “Any power station that burns more fossil fuels like gas is just worsening climate change,” she said. The backdrop to Labor’s announcement is the National party targeting Labor-held seats in the Hunter Valley, hoping to recruit voters disaffected by Labor’s more ambitious climate change commitments. Retiring Labor veteran Joel Fitzgibbon, who suffered a significant voter backlash in his Hunter electorate in the 2019 election, has spent much of this term warning Labor will lose another election if it pursues ambitious climate commitments at the expense of regional jobs in traditional industries.",News/Australia news,Labor pledges extra funding for Snowy Hydro power plant to make it run on green hydrogen,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/01/labor-pledges-extra-funding-for-snowy-hydro-power-plant-to-make-it-run-on-green-hydrogen
2/1/2022,"New Zealand’s Catholic church has admitted that 14% of its diocesan clergy have been accused of abusing children and adults since 1950. The church released the figures at the request of the royal commission on abuse in care, set up in 2018 by prime minister Jacinda Ardern, who said the country needed to confront “a dark chapter” in its history, and later expanded it to include churches and other faith-based institutions.  An interim report by the commission in December found up to a quarter of a million children, young people and vulnerable adults were physically and sexually abused in New Zealand’s faith-based and state care institutions from the 1960s to early 2000s. Te Rōpū Tautoko, the group that coordinates church engagement with the royal commission, sought and examined records from the country’s six Catholic dioceses and from 43 Catholic religious congregations (also known as religious institutes, orders or associations). The research included records of 428 Catholic parishes, 370 Catholic schools and 67 other care institutions. The allegations of abuse captured physical, sexual, and emotional or psychological abuse, and neglect. A failure to act on reports and facilitating abuse were also included. The extent of the allegations of abuse in the church in Aotearoa New Zealand had not been collated before now, said Catherine Fyfe, the chair of Te Rōpū Tautoko. “The Information Gathering Project was a major exercise involving dozens of people over two years, including searching paper files dating back 70 years in hundreds of places.”The findings found that since 1950, 1,350 children and 164 adults reported suffering abuse, with the age of a further 167 not established by the research. Of the 1,680, almost half (835) were reports alleging sexual harm against a child and 80% of all reports were related to children. Of the total, 687 relate to educational facilities, 425 to residential care, 228 to parishes and 122 to other locations, and the rest were at unidentified locations. Allegations were made against: 14% of Catholic diocesan clergy, who worked for a bishop and not a congregation, 8% of male congregational members (brothers or priests) and 3% of female congregation members (sisters or nuns). Most of the abuse reported happened in the 1960s and 1970s, with 75% occurring before 1990. Te Rōpū Tautoko said that the records will not represent all abuse that has happened in the care of the Catholic church, as the research covers only recorded reports alleging abuse. The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (Snap) said the actual scale of abuse was likely to be much higher based on the information it has from its members – “as high as twelvefold, given data indicating about only one in 12 have reported [abuse] in regions across New Zealand”. “The church has simply released what information it has recorded and this should not be seen as a comprehensive listing of all abuse that has occurred. The actual scale of sexual abuse is very difficult to measure.” Snap said while the church acknowledges that harm was done, there has been no substantial change in the church’s own internal training methods and culture. “In the handling of abuse complaints, its investigative processes are based on the balance of probabilities and are not complainant centred.” The statistics were “horrifying” and something the church was “deeply ashamed of”, said Cardinal John Dew, the president of the NZ Catholic Bishops Conference. “I am grateful that so much work has been done in researching the details and making them public. “As we continue to respond to the royal commission into abuse and we build a safer church for everyone, I firmly hope that facts like these will help us to face the sad reality. The church will learn from this and affirm its commitment to the work of safeguarding.”",News/World news,New Zealand’s Catholic church admits 14% of clergy have been accused of abuse since 1950,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/01/new-zealands-catholic-church-admits-14-of-clergy-have-been-accused-of-abuse-since-1950
2/1/2022,"Tropical humidity is set to hit south-east Queensland this week, raising concerns of large-scale power outages as Queenslanders try to stay cool. Temperatures are already high, with ​Brisbane expected to hit 34C on Tuesday followed by 36C on Wednesday.  The heatwave has stretched inland to the central highlands, with Lockington recording 41.7C at 11 am on Tuesday morning. The tropical heatwave means the humidity in large parts of the state is sitting at 90%, making it feel much hotter than it is. Meteorologist Brooke Pagel said the heatwave is pushing temperatures between 5-10C above average for this time of year and the uncommonly high dew points, which measure the moisture in the air, will make it feel hotter. “When you have high dew points and high humidity – which is not actually common when you see humidity and high temperatures together – it will actually feel closer to 40C in south-east Queensland,” Pagel, who works for the Bureau of Meteorology, said. “With that combination, the ‘feels like’ temperature is really going to increase even if the temperatures in some cities hover around 34-36C.” The tropical temperatures are being caused by a trough that is heading towards the east coast and mixing with moisture from the north. A reprieve is expected with a strong southerly change and a dramatic drop in temperatures on Thursday. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The dew points for south-east Queensland at this time of year normally sit between 19 and 21C but are currently in the mid-20s, creating levels of humidity more in line with temperatures in Darwin or Cairns. Pagel said the Bureau of Meteorology considered anything above a dew point of 18C as “uncomfortable”. “It is unusual to see this combination of humidity and high temperatures,” she said. The heatwave is causing concerns there will be power outages, with Powerlink chief executive Paul Simshauser asking Queenslanders to reduce their electricity consumption over the next two days. Queensland is forecast to reach record electricity demand of 10,032 MW – close to the 2019 record of 10,044MW –later today. “We’re encouraging electricity customers to reduce their energy consumption where safe to do so over the next two days,” Simshauser said. “Your safety and wellbeing is important so only reduce energy consumption if it is safe to do so. We appreciate your efforts in reducing power use.” Queensland has several large generators undergoing emergency maintenance which is adding to the pressure on the grid, he said. “In the event of supply outages, it is important to note emergency services and other priority groups such as hospitals and nursing homes will be given priority access to electricity supply to ensure that crucial services are available.”",News/Australia news,Fears of power outages as ‘unusual’ weather combination ramps up Queensland heat,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/01/fears-of-power-outages-as-unusual-weather-combination-ramps-up-queensland-heat
2/1/2022,"It’s the time of year they call the “hungry gap”, when the land is exhausted but winter drags on. We looked across the bare ground on which we stood, through a low grey sky, to the deep grey ashwoods opposite, which rippled up the far slope following its contours. The only chromatic variation came from the canopy, which was feathered pale as if dusted with frost. How odd to get down into the dale’s darkest section and suddenly be overwhelmed by the colours of life. The woodland flanking Cressbrook’s stream is so sheathed in mosses that it takes on an almost animate, mammalian quality. It’s not only the green-furred trees but the walls, the ground, any waist-high sapling or even just a dead stick or snag somehow lodged upright.  Everything was coated in moss, but unevenly, so that twig ends blossom out as rounded nest-like masses. These cushions have, in turn, given opportunity for lichens and polypody ferns to take hold. Yet the most completely transformed are hawthorns. Instead of their customary February profile of barbed-wired meanness, they are turned into something suggestively soft and enfolded. While everywhere is in subaquatic gloom, the moss limbs of these smothered hawthorns are a singing yellow-green. They evoke something paradoxical or upside down, like a skeleton in a wedding dress. Mosses, like ferns and liverworts, are often called “lower plants” – a reference to their different, simpler ecology and to the fact that they appeared on Earth far earlier than the dominant vegetation of our modern world, which comprises plants called angiosperms. Heather moorland, flower meadows, deciduous woods, even our gardens are populated with angiosperms. Look out of your window now and you’re almost certainly seeing some of the planet’s 308,000 species. Mosses and ferns may be “lower plants”, but we shouldn’t mistake that as meaning lesser or less successful. In Cressbrook, you see how vibrant the presence of these 400m-year-old survivors is. Here, the angiosperm trees look little more than a convenient scaffold or stage on which the Earth’s lower plants fulfil their ongoing destinies and thrive.
