12/19/2021,"Three retired U.S. generals warned in a chilling column Friday that another coup attempt in America in 2024 could divide the military and plunge an unprepared nation into civil war. “With the country still as divided as ever, we must take steps to prepare for the worst,” wrote former Army Major Gen. Paul Eaton, former Brigadier Gen. Steven Anderson and former Army Major Gen. Antonio Taguba. As the nation nears the first anniversary of the Capitol riot, the generals are “increasingly concerned about the aftermath of the 2024 presidential election and the potential for lethal chaos inside our military, which would put all Americans at severe risk,” they wrote in The Washington Post. “In short: We are chilled to our bones at the thought of a coup succeeding next time,” they added. The next time could be far more cataclysmic if members of the military throw in with those who want to overthrow the government, the generals warned. “Without constant maintenance, the potential for a military breakdown mirroring societal or political breakdown is very real,” the trio noted. A “disturbing number” of veterans and even active-duty military members took part in the attack on the Capitol. The “potential for a total breakdown of the chain of command along partisan lines ... is significant should another insurrection occur,” they added. In a “contested election, with loyalties split,” some might “follow orders from the rightful commander in chief,” while other “rogue units” might “follow the Trumpian loser ... it is not outlandish to say a military breakdown could lead to civil war,” the generals warned. The “lack of military preparedness for the aftermath of the 2020 election was striking and worrying. Trump’s acting defense secretary, Christopher Miller, testified that he deliberately withheld military protection of the Capitol before Jan. 6,” the generals noted. That can’t happen again, they emphasized. Military leaders can’t wait for elected officials to take adequate action to prepare for the next time. “Not a single leader who inspired” the last attempt has even been “held to account,” the generals noted. The Pentagon must act now to reenforce “unity of command,” and order an immediate “civics review” for all members — uniformed and civilian — on the Constitution and electoral integrity, the generals urged. And in a particularly dark scenario, the generals recommended that the Defense Department “war-game the next potential post-election insurrection or coup attempt to identify weak spots.” Everyone, they urged, must “show more urgency.” Check out the entire column here.

12/19/2021,"By Ben Blanchard TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan's opposition suffered a major setback on Saturday after voters rejected four referendums it had championed as a show of no confidence in the government. The defeat of the referendums comes as Taipei faces growing military and political pressure from Beijing, and is a boost for President Tsai Ing-wen https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-election-idUSKBN1ZA009 - re-elected by a landslide last year on vows to stand up to China. China claims the democratically ruled island as its own territory. Taiwan's main opposition party the Kuomintang, or KMT, which traditionally favours close ties with Beijing, is hoping to make a comeback in key mayoral elections late next year. Saturday's two most contentious referendums asked whether to ban imports of pork containing the leanness-enhancing additive ractopamine on safety grounds, and whether to relocate a planned liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal to protect a reef. The government approved the pork imports last year, hoping to remove a stumbling block for a free trade deal with the United States, where ractopamine is widely used, and show it is a reliable trade partner. It says the LNG terminal will secure energy supplies for the semiconductor-producing island, hit by power cuts https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/hot-drought-hit-taiwan-struck-by-power-cuts-second-time-week-2021-05-17/#:~:text=Taiwan%20dealing%20with%20drought%2C%20high%20temperatures%20TAIPEI%2C%20May,restored%20by%201340%20GMT%2C%20electricity%20provider%20Taipower%20said in May. Government officials have said the LNG terminal will be moved further offshore to minimise the impact on the reef, but Saturday's referendum sought a complete relocation. Turnout on Saturday was low, but the government welcomed the referendums' defeat. ""Taiwan's people want to go out into the world, and are willing to actively participate in the international community,"" Tsai told reporters, referring to the pork vote. Her government hopes the result will also bolster its case to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP. Asked about the vote, an official at the American Institute in Taiwan, the de facto U.S. embassy in the absence of formal diplomatic relations, said: ""We will continue to seek constructive engagement with Taiwan on issues that affect exports of U.S. food and agricultural products."" KMT Chairman Eric Chu, who assumed the role in September on a promise to revitalise party fortunes, apologised for the failure. ""Let's not be discouraged. Let's continue to work hard. We will always stand with the people. We must always represent the people's opinions and oppose the democratic dictatorship of the government,"" he said. Cold weather could have been to blame for the low turnout, he added. The KMT had also asked voters to approve a third issue, to restart a mothballed nuclear plant, saying that was the best way to ensure energy supplies. The government wants to phase out nuclear power.
