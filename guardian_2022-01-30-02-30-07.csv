1/30/2022,"Standout individual performances at domestic level can be a double edged sword for clubs that value consistency. The benefits are obvious, and any coach will tell you how much they enjoy seeing their charges achieve higher honours. But there are costs whenever a national selector comes calling for star players.  Rob Baxter now understands this sting as his Exeter Chiefs squandered a 14-point lead to lose at London Irish. Five of his stalwarts now call Eddie Jones their boss as they gear up for England’s Six Nations campaign starting next week. Only Leicester and Saracens have had to relinquish more players for the Red Rose. And in Luke Cowan-Dickie, Sam Simmonds, Jonny Hill, Henry Slade and Jack Nowell, the Chiefs have effectively had their backbone ripped out. Not that they looked spineless in the opening exchanges in West London. A superior kicking game and relentlessly swift ball from the breakdown saw wave after wave of white shirted bodies crash over the gain line. Close-range tries from Olly Woodburn and Patrick Schickerling inside 20 minutes was just as much as they deserved. London Irish were hospitable during this period. Coughing up the ball in the tackle and failing to match their guests’ ferocity. But momentum is a fickle concept and the tide turned once Paddy Jackson came into the contest. Wraparound loops and neat pops off his shoulder found the regular runs of Curtis Rona and Lucio Cinti. The two Wallaby locks Adam Coleman and Rob Simmons exerted themselves around the fringe and Tom Pearson emerged as the most prevalent presence at the breakdown. And so the pendulum swung. Matt Cornish had the last touch on a move orchestrated by the forwards midway through the half. Jackson missed the shot at extras but made no mistake with two penalties shortly after. He’d have the last say in the half with a conversion following James Stokes’ try in the right corner. It was an excellent score that saw Jackson break a line before Ben Loader’s offload under pressure found his full-back on the gallop. Stokes deserved his try after expertly staying in touch and satisfying a lengthy review from the TMO. That meant the home side were in front at the restart. Value for their lead and looking to secure a Premiership double over the men from Devon for the first time since 2011. Such was their confidence that they opted for consecutive scrums from a penalty right under Exeter’s posts with only a four-point lead. The second half was an arm wrestle and Exeter could have used some of their heavier hitters. Credit must go to Irish though who scrapped like a side conscious of their standing. This win moves them above the Chiefs into sixth place. It is 11 years since they made the play-offs. Their fate is now with them as they have a clutch of games against teams above them. And though they remain a long shot to end among the top four, their mongrel will give them belief. Every time Exeter romped towards their red zone they found a way of securing a turnover. Cinti’s steal after 73 minutes ensured that the remaining action would take place with the Exiles in control, so much so that Jackson’s two missed penalties were irrelevant. The Chiefs will know they let this slip after such a commanding lead. Dealing in hypotheticals and what-ifs isn’t helpful but Baxter will surely wonder what might have been had he had some of his regulars to hand.",Sport/Sport,Cornish and Stokes edge London Irish to comeback victory over Exeter ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/29/london-irish-exeter-premiership-rugby-union-match-report
1/30/2022,"If Sunderland’s recent history is littered with embarrassments, this was another candidate for the title of the new low. They can seem to be slumming it in League One, but they slumped to their heaviest ever defeat in third-tier football. In a meeting of the inspired and the insipid, Bolton’s third win in a week at least suggested League One has some restorative powers for them. For Sunderland, it seems the land of broken dreams and an ignominious exile from their natural terrain looks like to continue.  Bolton could savour a demolition, orchestrated by a recent arrival who highlighted the shift in their fortunes. A ground that hosted Atletico Madrid in 2008 will stage Accrington in April. Bolton used to sign from Real Madrid. Now they have recruited Accrington’s Northern Ireland international Dion Charles and the striker, one of six January signings, scored his second and third goals for his new employers. He ran Sunderland ragged. The Black Cats’ ineptitude was epitomised by Danny Batth, donating Bolton’s fifth goal with a spectacular diving header. Chalk it up, perhaps, to the curse of Ian Evatt. In October, Bolton’s manager branded his team the best in League One and they promptly went on a losing run. This week, he declared Sunderland were the division’s best footballing side. They scarcely looked it as they received a suitably windswept welcome near the Pennine Moors. If Bolton’s 19-year-old goalkeeper James Trafford could claim the assist for their opener, so could a gust. Young Trafford’s punt forward lured his Sunderland counterpart Thorben Hoffmann off his line, held up in the gale and allowed Charles to nip in and lob him, though the wind made a valiant effort to stop the ball from crossing the line. Sunderland were shaken by Bolton’s high-energy approach. The electric Dapo Afolayan’s stay at this level may be brief, whether or not Bolton’s is, and the former West Ham forward tucked in the second when teed up by Kieran Lee after the marauding Charles broke clear on the right. A new-look strike duo combined again when Afolayan headed Gethin Jones’ deep cross into the path of Charles, who hooked in a half-volley. Lee, elusive and excellent as a No 10, added the fourth after a slick passing move involving Afolayan and Aaron Morley. Evatt took mercy on Sunderland and substituted his front duo but the luckless Batth and Declan John made it six. Amid the carnage, Jack Clarke and Patrick Roberts made inauspicious Sunderland debuts in cameos. They are wingers who cost Tottenham and Manchester City a combined £22 million. If Sunderland has become a home for lost talents, this seemed another case of how careers have gone wrong. But then recent years have contained more than their fair share of indignities for clubs with a combined total of 6,142 games among the elite. If neither has never fully recovered from Sam Allardyce’s departure, they clashed in the top flight in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries and first met in the third tier in 2019. Bolton headed down to the fourth thereafter. At least they are glad to be back in a division containing two of the last seven FA Cup winners and with seven members, including Charlton, Ipswich, Portsmouth, Sheffield Wednesday and Wigan, who have played Premier League football in the 21st century. There are tales of administration, relegation and recrimination, of mistakes and mismanagement. For Bolton, at least, this may be a story of renewal, for Sunderland, one of purgatory in a footballing netherworld.",Sport/Football,Dion Charles inspires Bolton rout as sorry Sunderland are hit for six,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/29/bolton-sunderland-match-report-league-one
1/30/2022,"Despite Worcester’s latest Premiership defeat at the hands of a polished Northampton, perhaps the Warriors players on show can consider this a successful audition for lead roles in the club’s new era.  The appointment of Steve Diamond as Worcester’s new director of rugby was announced this week – he remains ‘lead rugby consultant’ for now – and the former Sale head coach will begin a two-year contract in the top job this summer. In his programme notes Diamond wrote that he had been impressed with the mentality of staff and players in a turbulent week. The scoreless opening 20 minutes at Sixways would have similarly satisfied him: to the uninitiated it would have been far from clear, from the breathless opening, which of these teams is competing near the top of the table and which is second-bottom. But after that the class of Northampton, and the new Wales captain Dan Biggar, began to tell. Worcester’s ambition was demonstrated early on when two presentable penalty opportunities were passed up for kicks to the corner. The wings Duhan van der Merwe and Perry Humphreys had both looked bright and breezy for the hosts, but after 20 minutes, a well-timed pop pass by Biggar sent the hooker Sam Matavesi scorching through a midfield hole. Worcester scrambled well in defence but Northampton won a penalty and Biggar kicked for the corner. Teimana Harrison claimed Matavesi’s delivery from the lineout, and after the visitors gained a few metres via a strong driving maul, Rory Hutchinson did well to stretch and touch down the opening try. Biggar converted for 7-0. The 19-year-old Worcester fly-half, Fin Smith, replied immediately with a sweetly-struck penalty but Northampton soon threatened again with a rousing run through the middle by the dynamic No 8 Juarno Augustus, a live wire presence in the Saints’ back row. Worcester’s Humphreys was yellow-carded for a deliberate knock-on when Northampton sent the ball through the hands to the left, and were arguably lucky that the referee, Ian Tempest, decided not to award a penalty try into the bargain. Again, Biggar kicked the penalty for the corner, and Saints got their try regardless, Matavesi flopping over following another well-executed driving maul. Biggar’s tricky attempted conversion faded away. Three minutes before half-time, Saints tightened their grip when the scrum-half Alex Mitchell darted through a gaping hole in the Worcester defence and raced over unchallenged from near halfway, a classic sniping score for a No 9, if rather soft from the hosts’ point of view. It was 19-3 to the visitors at the break. Biggar added a penalty seven minutes after the break but Worcester kept bashing away, and a bullocking run by Rory Sutherland, the Scotland prop, into the 22 had the crowd on their feet. Warriors fans were roaring again seconds later when Van der Merwe was nearly in on the right wing following a rampaging break, and they maintained pressure on the visiting defence until Sutherland crashed over from within a forest of bodies on the line. That brought the hosts to within two converted tries, inside the final 20 minutes, and when the Warriors captain Ted Hill charged into space on the left and was tackled just short of the line, Sixways was truly rocking and the home fans believed. Ashley Beck then cantered over the line with 15 minutes left to reduce the deficit to nine points, and a thrilling finish seemed to be in store. It was not to be. With 10 minutes left, another muscular drive from an attacking lineout for Northampton resulted in a try for James Fish, a bonus point for Northampton, and the end of Worcester’s spirited challenge. Diamond has his work cut out at Worcester but a few gems to polish up, too.",Sport/Sport,Class of Northampton’s Dan Biggar too much for gallant Worcester,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/29/worcester-northampton-premiership-rugby-union-match-report
1/30/2022,"The rising fortunes of the world’s billionaires during the pandemic helped fuel a record £5.3bn in superyacht sales last year, prompting calls for new curbs on their emissions. New figures reveal that 887 superyachts were sold in 2021, an increase of more than 75% compared with the previous year. Yachting brokers say some of the demand has been from wealthy clients seeking a secure refuge from the pandemic.  Sam Tucker, head of the superyachts team at VesselsValue, the maritime and aviation data firm which compiled the report, said: “It has been the strongest year on record for the number of transactions and the money spent.” He said low interest rates and rising stock markets had meant more disposable income for the world’s richest people. A superyacht is typically defined as a privately owned vessel 78 feet (24 metres) or more in length. According to industry data, there are more than 9,300 on the seas worth a total in excess of £50bn. While maritime construction yards are keen to promote the green credentials of many superyachts, they are major polluters. It has been estimated a superyacht with permanent crew, helicopter pad, submarines and pools emits about 7,020 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, more than 1,500 times higher than a typical family car. Paul Stretesky, a professor of social sciences at Northumbria University and co-author of a 2019 report, Measuring the Ecological Impact of the Wealthy, said more financial levies were needed on the superyacht industry. He said: “The damage done by this conspicuous consumption is incredible. It’s not something we should aspire to, it’s something we should stop.” Stretesky’s report found that the annual fuel costs of a superyacht can be about £300,000. A report last year by the environmental platform EcoWatch analysed the carbon footprint of 20 billionaires. It found a superyacht was “by far the worst asset to own from an environmental standpoint”. The Russian tycoon Roman Abramovich, who is reported to have owned at least five superyachts, topped the list published in February last year, accounting for estimated annual carbon emissions of nearly 34,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. The biggest vessel in his fleet is the 163-metre (535ft) superyacht Eclipse. It has nine decks, with the top one containing two helipads and a garage. It has a 16-metre (53ft) swimming pool that can be converted into a dancefloor. It is estimated to be worth £1bn after extensive refurbishments. Amazon tycoon Jeff Bezos was near the bottom of the carbon footprint league table in last year’s analysis, but has rapidly climbed up the table in 2021 with a trip to the outer edge of space and reports he had commissioned a new superyacht with the project name Y721. The £350m yacht will accommodate 18 guests with a 40-stong crew and will be escorted by its own support vessel. New rules were due to come into force in 2016 to curb some of the most dangerous nitrogen oxide emissions from superyachts, which can be about 300 times as potent as carbon dioxide at heating the atmosphere. The industry successfully lobbied for the International Maritime Organization (IMO) emission standards to be delayed for five years for superyachts under 500 tonnes. They were finally implemented in January last year, but the US Coast Guard has said it will not enforce the regulations after lobbying by the marine industry which says the bulky equipment required to remove pollution out of engine exhaust is impractical on many yachts.",News/Environment,Superyacht sales surge prompts fresh calls for curbs on their emissions,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/29/superyacht-sales-surge-prompts-fresh-calls-for-curbs-on-their-emissions
1/30/2022,"Cruise ships, called “floating petri dishes” early in the pandemic for their role in propagating infection, are back in the news. One company, in what would be an ugly alliance of capitalist and communist exploitation, is accused of colluding with the government of Cuba to force Cuban crew members to work under “slave labour” conditions. Another, Crystal Cruises, chose not to return its ship Crystal Symphony to Florida, for fear that it would be arrested for $4.6m (£3.4m) in unpaid fuel bills. It was diverted to Bimini in the Bahamas and its passengers were obliged to end their two-week dream cruise with a vomit-inducing ferry trip through what was called “inclement weather”. According to a legal expert quoted by the Washington Post, their claims for compensation are likely to be limited by the terms and conditions that cruise companies tend to impose on their customers. No one familiar with the dark arts of this multibillion-dollar business will be surprised after the notorious “poop cruise” of 2013, in which raw sewage backed up into passenger areas. Lawyers for its owner, Carnival Cruise Line, argued that the “ticket contract makes absolutely no guarantee for safe passage, a seaworthy vessel, adequate and wholesome food and sanitary and safe living conditions”.  When George Osborne launched his help-to-buy scheme in 2013, which was supposed to support homebuyers with government-supported loans, its likely flaws should have been obvious to anyone with the most basic grasp of economics. By increasing demand it would push prices up, which would defeat the purpose of the exercise. The main beneficiaries would be those selling the product in question, the volume housebuilders who went on to make large profits and award handsome bonuses to their executives. Now, a recent House of Lords report finds that the scheme, “which will have cost around £29bn in cash terms by 2023, inflates prices by more than its subsidy value in areas where it is needed the most”. It is usually left-leaning administrations that are accused of squandering public money on ideologically driven projects, but here a Tory government has done just that. Such money would have been better spent on actually building humane and beautiful affordable housing. Peter Barber is an architect who for years has been creating just that, within the exacting demands of the business of constructing homes. Last week, the Royal Academy of Arts made him a Royal Academician, an honour that puts him in the same ranks of celebrated artists such as Tracey Emin and Anish Kapoor. It’s heartening to see such recognition for the application of creativity to the places where people lead their everyday lives. In the Caazapá region of Paraguay, there’s an attempt to build a utopia for those who want to escape “the socialist trends of current economic and political situations worldwide”. It welcomes vaccine sceptics, doubters of the US 2020 presidential election and those who fear 5G, fluoridated water, healthcare mandates and Muslims. It is a place for people, whom the project’s founder, Erwin Annau, calls “enlightened Christians”, who “are concerned about our daughters”. El Paraíso Verde, as it is called, says that it seeks “innovative thinkers, engineers, hairdressers, restaurateurs, shopkeepers, alternative healing practitioners”. I don’t wish any more trouble on Paraguay than it already has, but I hope that this community will also welcome the know-nothing loudmouths in the rightwing British media, who for nearly two years have been opposing every sane step, from mask-wearing to working from home, without which this country’s death toll would be even higher than it is.

1/30/2022,"Watching TV feels like a benign pastime, but as all TVs become “smart” – connected to the internet via your router – they are gaining the ability to watch you too. As soon as you switch them on, smart TVs made by the likes of LG, Samsung and Sony are gathering data from the TV itself, as well as from the operating system and apps. Then there are the devices you plug into your TV, such as Google’s Chromecast, Apple TV and Amazon’s Fire Stick. A TV is no longer just a device for showing you content – it has become a two-way mirror allowing you to be observed in real time by a network of advertisers and data brokers, says Rowenna Fielding, director of data protection consultancy Miss IG Geek. “The purpose of this is to gather as much information as possible about your behaviour, interests, preferences and demographics so it can be monetised, mainly through targeted advertising.”  Smart TV spying is difficult to avoid. A study by researchers at Northeastern University and Imperial College London found data from TVs and smart devices was sent to Google’s ad business and to Netflix, even if people didn’t have Netflix. The data collected by your smart TV depends on its manufacturer, brand and version. In theory, most smart TVs are capable of collecting audio, video and TV usage data, says Toby Lewis, global head of threat analysis at cybersecurity company Darktrace. Voice activation is one feature with the potential to gather large amounts of data. Microphones and software are listening for instructions and they can capture conversations and other sounds within range. These recordings might be sent to third parties to be analysed. Cross-device tracking is another issue to consider. Data collected via your smart TV is more valuable when combined with information from other smart devices such as mobile phones, laptops and home automation gear, according to Fielding. “This allows individuals to be profiled in detail: geo-location history, web browsing activity and social media information can be added to TV data.” Then there are the cookies and trackers. Apps and browsers on smart TVs use cookie- and pixel-tracking technologies just like websites do to track, recognise and identify devices for user-profiling. “Most apps installed on your smart TV will be snitching to a large network of advertisers and data brokers,” Fielding warns. There is no clear-cut answer. What exactly is done with the data is complex and “highly opaque”, says Lewis. “When looking at what a smart TV does on the network, it is often unclear why certain data is being harvested and where it is being sent.” There is not much difference between TV brands. Manufacturers claim to use your information for “personalisation” and quality of content, but it is common to sell this type of data, anonymised or semi-anonymised, to third parties, advertising companies or streaming services. “After the data has been sold, it is out of the manufacturer’s control,” Lewis says. “It is often unclear what data exactly is being sent back, depending on the T&Cs and privacy settings, and it can be very difficult to change default settings once you have agreed to them.” Using streaming services on a smart TV is another surefire way to hand over lots of your personal data. Apps such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Now TV tend to claim they only use data for necessary services such as recommendations or credit checks. But this can include data such as device identifiers, geo-location, browser type, email address and payment information. Netflix’s powerful recommendations algorithm fuels the quality of its service by helping you choose which shows to watch. If you log on to Netflix via your browser, you can tweak the privacy settings to limit the data that’s collected and shared. Yet most of the data Netflix gathers, such as the shows you watched and when, is so core to its service that you can’t opt out of it. Back to the smart TV itself. One scary feature to look out for is automated content recognition (ACR). Often turned on by default, this uses analytical techniques to identify video and audio running on the TV, matching it against a big database to identify what’s being played. It’s pretty creepy stuff – ACR works on anything played on the TV including DVDs and Blu-rays, CDs and games. Viewing data and habits are shared with manufacturers and ultimately sold to advertisers in order to target you with ads, says Jake Moore, global cybersecurity adviser at security company ESET. When your TV is connected to your home router, data will include your IP address and location too, he adds. And in theory, ACR could be used for even more unsettling profiling, says Lewis. “With the analytical technologies available, data from facial recognition, sentiment analysis, speech-to-text and content analysis could be gathered to build an in-depth picture of an individual user.” Instead of matching content against a list of known movies, ACR could in theory be analysed for political position, ethnicity, socioeconomic position and other things that could be abused in the wrong hands, Lewis says. Using the browser on your TV might be convenient, but it’s a major attack target for hackers. This is because your smart TV browser lacks the antivirus and additional security settings built into your smartphone or PC. “Cyber-attackers can eavesdrop on the browser’s traffic and compromise the cookies that manage authentication to online services, such as social media accounts or online banking, and impersonate people,” says Dr Francisco Navarro, a senior lecturer at De Montfort University’s Cyber Security Centre in Leicester. But in contrast, experts say using your smartphone as a TV remote is fine. Just be mindful that connecting to a smart TV with a mobile will be done via Bluetooth or across the network, says James Griffiths, cofounder and technical director at security consultancy Cyber Security Associates. “If the smart TV was hacked, it might be used to attack your mobile device, but the risk of this happening is low.” As long as they are connected to the internet, smart TVs will collect data and you can’t stop this from happening altogether. In many instances it’s not in your interests to do so as it will affect your viewing experience – take Netflix’s useful recommendations features as an example. Yet there are some basic measures you can take to protect yourself from smart TV spying. Turn off ACR in the settings, disable personalisation, opt out of all advertising features and cover or disable cameras and microphones. It’s also important to make sure your router is protected by changing the password and setting up a guest network. You can improve security by opting out of web tracking when it’s offered and applying software updates as soon as they’re available.",News/Technology,What your smart TV knows about you – and how to stop it harvesting data,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/29/what-your-smart-tv-knows-about-you-and-how-to-stop-it-harvesting-data
1/30/2022,"Feast Is Feast With Big Zuu | Global Remi Burgz (Radio 1Xtra) | BBC Sounds  Going Home With Vick and Jordan (Radio 1) | BBC Sounds Wild Things: Siegfried and Roy | Apple TV+/At Will Media If you, like me, are in search of some joy during the longest January ever recorded, may I recommend the new food podcast Feast Is Feast, from Big Zuu? Zuu, real name Zuhair Hassan, “aka Zig Buu, aka Fat Mo Salah” (he’s a Liverpool fan), is a grime artist and rapper with a cooking show on Dave, Big Eats, where he makes meals for comedians. Big Eats is also the name of a track Zuu made with his cousin AJ Tracey. On this “poddy”, he’s louder, warmer, sillier: “You say random things! It’s a poddy!” He’s a complete delight. The show is, on the surface, similar to other well established foodie podcasts out there. Like Table Manners with Jessie and Lennie Ware, or Out to Lunch with the Observer’s own Jay Rayner, or Comfort Eating with Grace Dent, it uses food as a way into understanding a celebrity interviewee. But with each of these shows some eating is involved, whether a full meal or a comforting snack. Zuu’s approach is simpler. There’s no actual food here at all. He just chats with his interviewee about food-related stuff: what they ate as children, how they eat today, how they use meals in their job, what turns their stomach. So far, he’s had two guests: musician Craig David and footballer turned pundit Jermaine Jenas. Both episodes are revelatory, not just in content, but in tone. Zuu brings the right vibes, married to the correct respect, and you can hear his guests relax. Their professional demeanour melts away, replaced by something more jokey, intimate and honest. You realise just how much they’ve been dialling down their full personalities for mainstream audiences. David, in particular, is a brilliant listen. He clearly loves food – not cooking it, but eating it – and his pleasure is thoroughly infectious. He talks about selling (and eating) chocolate bars at school (“getting high on my own supply”), and describes how much he loved a particular chicken wrap made at an Ibizan hotel. Jenas is a surprise too, his Nottingham roots much more noticeable than on TV. Born to a Jamaican dad and a British mum, with all the culinary variety that implies, his ideal food is northern “stodge”: sausage, mash, gravy inside a big yorkshire pudding. But truly, this podcast should be heard simply for David describing the complicated way he eats Ben & Jerry’s Cookie Dough ice-cream. I hope you noticed that I got through an entire section on food podcasts without using the words “ambush” and “cake”. In this, I am unlike Greg James, who, on Wednesday, asked his Radio 1 breakfast listeners to call in with their personal cake ambush scenarios. That’s where we are as a nation, politics-wise. I’ve been flipping between dials at breakfast, and every time I’ve gone back to the Today programme, I hear another lower rank politician minutely parsing the meaning of the words “party” or “work” or “rules”. And I switch to another station, again. Anyway, after Zuu, I decided to extend my cheerful listening by tuning to 1Xtra in the afternoon, where new recruit Remi Burgz is into the second week of her afternoon show. Burgz is a born chatterer, with a mad laugh, and knows to ride the music when she occasionally searches for words. Her show will develop; for the moment, she’s nailing the good-time atmosphere. Over on Radio 1, in the Going Home slot, Vick Hope and Jordan North are another upbeat listen. Now six months into their slot, they easily spin silly chat into something listener-inclusive. And, for us oldies, now that Radio 1 music can be anything and everything, the playlist can sound weirdly familiar. At one point Hope and North played a track (Ben Hemsley’s Love Peace and Harmony) that was so early-90s, I started having flashbacks. Straight after, they went into an impromptu riff about “-ation” words, inspired by the “higher and higher – temp-ta-tion” Heaven 17 sample in the Hemsley song. Later, some daftness about whether you should be able to video-call friends from the bath. Listeners responded to both, immediately. A nice way to forget about real life. I was hoping for more escapism with Wild Things, a podcast about the madly camp magic-with-white-tigers-in-Vegas act of Siegfried and Roy. Unfortunately, presenter Steven Leckart has elected to take S & R seriously, which rather kills the fun. Dry, diligent reporting is not what this story needs. It requires more surprise, more sugar.

1/30/2022,"As the Conservative party plots a way out of “partygate”, with or without its current leader, the path towards re-election in 2023 or 2024 is looking hazardous. In December 2019, flush with an 80-seat majority and a public spending deficit of just 2.6%, the outlook was rosy for a cabinet dominated by Brexiters keen to reward their supporters with one spending initiative after another.  Spraying money around was not a problem while the deficit was low and the extra borrowed funds were clearly earmarked for investment. Criticism from small-state Tories, mindful of the demand from constituents for tax cuts, would be smothered by the joyful urge to spend after a decade of austerity. And there was the added bonus of political cover offered by a Labour party that had argued over several years for higher spending on infrastructure, support for small businesses and skills training. Billions and billions of pounds were going to be spent pump-priming a stagnant economy that had suffered badly since the 2016 Brexit vote, not that Brexit was ever going to be blamed. According to the rhetoric, boom-boom Britain was just a few steps away, with its attendant fruit of high-skilled, high-wage jobs for all. That was then. The outlook these days is far from rosy, especially now that the pandemic has soaked up so much of the magic money tree’s imagined largesse. Underlying the arguments over April’s national insurance rise and the extent to which it will add to the rising cost of living is a more fundamental battle between low-tax Conservatives who believe in public spending restraint and those who still carry a flame for Johnson’s more extravagant plans. With his job-protecting furlough scheme declared a resounding success, Rishi Sunak considers himself, as chancellor, more on an equal footing with No 10, much as George Osborne did post-2010. As such, he leads a hawkish brigade who focus on the deficit and the overriding need to bring it back to pre-pandemic levels, with tax cuts to follow. The Office for Budget Responsibility says government borrowing reached a peacetime record of £320bn, or 15.2% of GDP, in the financial year 2020-21. The current year is expected to see that figure fall to £183bn, or 8% of GDP. Emphasising the dilemma facing those on both sides of the debate, the figures for December’s public spending show the deficit to be on an even lower trajectory. According to Johnson supporters, this hands the Treasury enough cash to boost welfare payments and offset the worst of rising prices for most people on low incomes while staying in line with the OBR forecast. Sunak supporters dismiss this way of thinking and ask why the deficit should not fall at a faster rate. The OBR forecast does not determine government policy: it only provides a framework, as its outgoing chief economist, Charlie Bean, emphasised last week. Bean, who was deputy governor of the Bank of England during the 2008 crash, told Bloomberg that ministers “look at the central OBR projection and say we’ve got whatever billions to play with, and then spend that exactly”. He added: “The consequence is that when we change our forecast by even a modest amount, that translates one-for-one into what the government thinks it can spend. It troubles me that policy is made that way.” And so it has proved in the pandemic. In March, the OBR will have another crack at the numbers. If it upgrades its forecasts, there will be yet more pressure on Sunak to spend the difference, while Sunak will still argue for years of austerity. Johnson and his supporters, foreign secretary Liz Truss among them, are desperate to recreate the spirit of that election victory in 2019 by spending every penny “allowed” by the OBR forecast and as much as they can get away with on top. If the economic landscape in 2022 looked like 2019, that might be a plausible position. Sadly, for them and the rest of us, large parts of the public sector are in desperate need of repair, to the extent that they will soak up any extra spending before anyone begins to even consider options for investment. The government could ignore the millions of school pupils who need to catch up with their studies and set aside hospital waiting lists, freeing up money for investment. Likewise, the 50% sliced from the skills training budget, the billions of pounds stripped from local authorities and the clamp on public sector pay could all remain in place. Yet that hardly seems plausible without beckoning forth an electoral rebellion when the Tories seek a new mandate. Too many contradictory promises have been made.

1/30/2022,"A Treasury minister who resigned over the government’s “schoolboy” handling of fraudulent Covid business loans has said there has been “not a zippo” of detail about how the chancellor plans to deal with the issue. Theodore Agnew of Oulton, who was the Tories’ anti-fraud minister, publicly resigned from his Cabinet Office and Treasury posts on Monday over the government’s decision to write off £4.3bn in fraudulent loans. He called the oversight of the scheme “nothing less than woeful”.  Discussing his dramatic exit in an interview with the Times, Lord Agnew said: “I didn’t want to blow my top, but I was very angry.” Agnew accused the government of “arrogance, indolence and ignorance” in its attitude to tackling fraud estimated to cost £29bn a year. “This isn’t natural for me, I took no pleasure from it but the failure of government to tackle fraud felt so egregious, and the need for remedy so urgent, that I felt my only option left was to smash some crockery to get people to take notice,” Agnew said. “In life, one should try to stay inside the tent to win the arguments but ultimately there comes a breaking point.” HMRC figures show fraudulent claims for furlough and other business relief schemes have resulted in a loss of an estimated £5.8bn. Reports suggest £4.3bn stolen of that sum has been written off as unrecoverable, but the Treasury has since disputed this figure. The minister’s dramatic departure drove Rishi Sunak to assure that the government would “do everything we can” to recover stolen funds. “I’m not ignoring it, and I’m definitely not ‘writing it off’,” the chancellor tweeted on Wednesday. However, Agnew told the Times that there had been “not a zippo” of detail about how the chancellor plans to tackle the situation. Agnew said his resignation, which comes as Boris Johnson battles to survive in his role as prime minister, was not an attack on the Tory leader, but that he could not remain in post. “Given that I am the minister for counter-fraud, it would be somewhat dishonest to stay on in that role if I am incapable of doing it properly. It is for this reason that I have sadly decided to tender my resignation as a minister across the Treasury and Cabinet Office with immediate effect,” he told the House of Lords on Monday.",News/Politics,Lord Agnew says there is ‘zippo’ detail on how UK will deal with Covid fraud,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/29/lord-agnew-not-a-zippo-about-how-uk-will-deal-with-covid
1/30/2022,"My name is Camilla, so why, for the first 25 years of my life, did everyone call me Mandy? My Jamaican mother loathed the name Camilla. She said my Nigerian father chose the name, but she thought Camilla sounded too damn serious and upper-class. And she was right. Growing up in Luton in the 70s and 80s, there weren’t too many Camillas knocking about the council estates of Bedfordshire. My friends’ names were plain and simple. They were called Debbie, Tracey, Jean. They were easy on the ear. Or their names were culturally appropriate – Jyoti, Shabana, Patience. But Camilla? It might have been the name written on my birth certificate, but my mother had other ideas. She had a plan. And it was hatched in the months after my birth – a new name. But there were caveats. Unlike Camilla, the new name had to be popular, jolly and understated, with preferably two syllables. So, she drew up a list of potentials: Donna, Paula, Charmaine, Joanne. Then bingo, she came up with the name: Mandy. Not Amanda, but Mandy. Plain. Simple. Easy on the ear, Mandy. Camilla wasn’t changed by deed poll, instead, my unofficial “new name” seeped into everyday life. Mandy seamlessly embedded itself on to the register at primary and secondary school, university and around the water cooler. The name Camilla became a relic of the past, a family joke, dragged out at Christmas like eggnog.  And what about my middle name? Camilla might be quintessentially British, but my middle name isn’t. It’s unashamedly Nigerian, and once my mother divorced the perpetrator of my first name debacle, my middle name joined Camilla in the names trash bin. She said my middle name – Adebisi – “screamed ethnic”, and if I wrote it on future job applications, it would be chucked into the “not one of us pile”. Mum said I should initialise Adebisi. In her opinion, the letter A gave choices. My middle name could be Abbie, Alice, Annie. Plain names. Assimilated names – AKA not foreign-sounding. Names matter. We all appreciate a good name. They hold a strange fascination and intrigue. When we’re introduced to someone, we can’t help ourselves, we don’t want to, but we form judgments because names carry all kinds of juicy information. Dr Rebecca Gregory from the Institute for Name-Studies says, “Socrates and Plato wrote about names in some of the earliest western philosophy but, historically, given names in the UK were drawn from an established pool of names (an onomasticon), which came from a few main origins: biblical sources, some from classical sources and others from vocabulary words.” But as we’ve become culturally and linguistically diverse, our naming conventions have changed. They’ve become varied and complex. We’ve witnessed the rise of the wacky name – Solo, Exton, Sixtus. The penchant for creating names from words or places – Apple, Chicago, Atom. Nature-inspired names – Willow, Sky, River. And the biggie – the influence of television on names. As Gregory says, “In 1996, there were no baby girls named Arya in England and Wales, but in 2019 it peaked at 427, and I think we all know why that is.” Names fall in and out of fashion. My mother-in-law was born in the 1930s and named Shirley, after Shirley Temple, but Shirley is outdated for our modern naming tastes – although there is some appetite for old-fashioned first names with a whiff of a “vintage, royal vibe”. According to the Office for National Statistics, the name Archie leapfrogged into the upper echelons of baby-name popularity courtesy of Meghan and Harry. But why was the reaction to Camilla so extreme? Why didn’t my mother simply shorten it to Milla, like Becky for Rebecca, Jimmy for James, Tan for Tanya? And why Mandy? When I hit the gobby, hormonal, arms-folded-across-the-chest teens, I asked my mother why she didn’t call me Molly, Maureen or Mary. They possessed the required two syllables. Why Mandy? In response, my mother hummed the song Mandy for a few moments and said, “If it’s good enough for Barry Manilow, it’s good enough for you. You’re Mandy. It means lovable. It’s a great name.” After that how could I disclose the truth? I liked the name Camilla. It was glamorous. Cool. The name Mandy didn’t fit. Most times I felt like I’d squeezed into a pair of ill-fitting, size-six jeans and the zip was breaking. When I said my name it felt dishonest. I wanted to say, hold on wait a minute, it’s not – I’m not Mandy. But I realised this might sound crazy. So I persevered. Everyone knew me as Mandy. I was Mandy, goddamit. I made a Herculean effort to love the name. It’s not a terrible name. In my teens, I searched out fellow Mandys, and the only Mandys I came across were Mandy Smith and Mandy Rice-Davies, and I later found out Rice-Davies’s first name wasn’t even Mandy, it was Marilyn. At 18, I went through a phase of Mandy-spelling experimentation. Out went dull Mandy, in came Mandi, then Mandie; I even added a double ee combo at the end; Mandee. I tried shortening it, but Mand didn’t quite cut it. By the time I got to university, first names got serious. Slews of confident students hung around lecture halls sprouting elongated names with more than two syllables – Alessandra, Henrietta, Viviana. So I thought I’d join them. I took the plunge. I introduced myself to someone as Camilla, only to be told I didn’t look like a Camilla. “What does a Camilla look like?” I asked. They replied, “Red-haired. Pale-skinned. Freckles. Celtic-looking. Wears tweed. Likes Enya. They don’t look like you.” After that, I kept my real name to myself. I didn’t divulge my first name to anyone else except my boyfriend – now husband. On our first date, I blurted out my real first name and he said: “Mandy’s a nice enough name, but Camilla’s beautiful.” But how could I reclaim Camilla? Everyone knew me as Mandy. The name was intertwined with my sense of self. But was it? Gregory says: “People adapt or change their names to suit the person they turn out to be. They want to use a name that fits their sense of identity.” So that’s what I did. In my mid-20s, I reclaimed my name. There wasn’t any fanfare. There was no Stars in Their Eyes, “Tonight Matthew, I’m going to be Camilla,” moment. I told a few close friends. I took a deep breath, explained my complicated name history and said, “Can you call me Camilla, not Mandy?” When I’d finished the feeling was similar to someone placing a warm blanket over my shoulders. For the first time in years my name fitted. The psychotherapist Sarah Parkin says: “When we feel we ‘fit’ our names, the effects can be hugely empowering and transformational.” And it was, but when you change name midway through your life, there’s bound to be the occasional blip or hiccup. Swathes of friends who knew me as Mandy had to adapt to my new first-name status, and they often forgot. Sometimes I forgot, too. I’d introduce myself as Mandy, then Camilla, and for a while, confusion reigned. Camilla went through a long bedding-in process. For those first few years, it was easier to say, “Call me whatever you feel comfortable with.” Parkin says: “Feeling comfortable with your name signals to the world you’ve found who you truly are.” For me, taking responsibility for my middle name and my actual first name, not a randomly chosen one, felt life-affirming. But not to one person – my mother. For her, the name Camilla comes with ex-husband baggage. And there’s another, perhaps more significant, reason for her reluctance to call me Camilla – Diana, Princess of Wales. As Princess Diana’s number one super-fan, she finds the name synonymous with Charles’s other woman. This seals the deal for my mother’s anti-Camilla sentiment. No further ammunition is required. Over the years, I have tried and failed to soothe her anxiety over my real name. On the few occasions she calls me Camilla, my mother morphs into Hyacinth Bucket meets Lady Danbury. She puts on her faux posh voice and, on her lips, my name sounds like she’s caught a rotten oyster in her throat. I might be Camilla to most people, but for her, I will forever and always be plain, simple, two syllables, easy on the ear, Mandy.@CamillaBalshaw",Lifestyle/Life and style,I reclaimed my birth name – and discovered why what we call ourselves really matters,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/29/i-reclaimed-my-birth-name-in-my-mid-20s-and-discovered-why-what-we-call-ourselves-matters
