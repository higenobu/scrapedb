1/20/2022,"Britain’s skeleton bobsleigh squad have warned their rivals not to write them off at next month’s Winter Olympics after revealing they have deliberately not gone “all guns blazing” during a mixed 2020-21 season. The skeleton has been Britain’s gold medal banker at the past three Games, with Amy Williams winning in Vancouver in 2010 and Lizzy Yarnold achieving back-to-back victories in Sochi and Pyeongchang. However medal success looks more unlikely this time with Matt Weston, who sits 1oth in the world, the highest ranked member of the Team GB squad announced on Wednesday.  However Weston says the four-strong squad, which also includes 2018 bronze medallist Laura Deas and newcomers Marcus Wyatt and Brogan Crowley could yet spring a surprise. “As a nation we’re so good at competing at the Games,” said Weston, who won Britain’s first men’s World Cup gold medal for 13 years in Igls in November but had inconsistent results in recent weeks. “We haven’t gone all guns blazing in any event yet. So the fact I’ve had a gold medal on not the Games’ equipment, and not the Games’ processes, fills me with a lot of confidence. So definitely don’t write us off.” Wyatt, who took silver in the Olympic test event in Beijing last October but has since slipped to 19th in the world, has also shown he can raise his game. Meanwhile Deas, who is ranked 20th in the women’s world rankings, says she can repeat her success in Pyeongchang if she gets to grips with her new sled. “This season has been pretty up and down,” Deas said. “But we’re constantly trying to learn and figure things out and we don’t roll everything out as a finished product until the Olympics itself. So I still very much feel like when I’m there, and we put our entire package together, that I can still do something special. “I’m not dwelling on what happened four years ago. The sport has moved on. We’ve had to move on. I’ve been adapting to a new sled this year as one example of how we’re trying to innovate and keep moving forward. Because you can’t rely on what you did last time round, or the time before that.”",Sport/Sport,Team GB warn rivals over underestimating skeleton squad in Beijing,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/19/winter-olympics-team-gb-warn-rivals-skeleton-bobsleigh-beijing-2022
1/20/2022,"Two asylum seekers who arrived in the UK as children but were wrongly assessed as adults by Home Office social workers have won a victory in the high court after it ruled that the way they were treated was unlawful. In his ruling on Wednesday, Mr Justice Henshaw found that the Home Office policy of conducting age assessments soon after arrival in the UK was unlawful, the decision to detain young people for them was unlawful, and the lack of an appropriate adult present for the assessments was also unlawful.  The ruling has been hailed as a victory for hundreds of unaccompanied asylum seeker children thought to have been subjected to the process. Shortly before Wednesday’s judgment was made public, the Home Office stopped social workers from carrying out age assessments of newly arrived young people at a processing centre for new asylum seeker arrivals called Kent Intake Unit and issued new guidance about age assessment for the new arrivals. The two children – a 16-year-old Kuwaiti Bidoon who arrived in the UK in the back of a lorry on 15 December 2020, and a 17-year-old Iranian boy who had spent seven to eight hours crossing the Channel in a dinghy – were subjected to truncated age assessments by social workers appointed by the Home Office. Previously, new arrivals in need of an age assessment to determine whether they were a child or an adult were assessed by Kent county council social workers. When the council was no longer able to manage the volume of new arrivals, the Home Office began to conduct age assessments “in house” from September 2020. Determining the age of young people is notoriously difficult. There is no proven scientific way of doing this and accepted good practice is for specially trained social workers to conduct a series of assessments before arriving at a decision in what is known as a “Merton compliant” age assessment process. The judgment highlights the way children and young people are treated by Home Office officials on arrival in the UK after enduring difficult journeys and fleeing danger in their home countries. The Kuwaiti Bidoon boy was detained in Yarl’s Wood immigration removal centre in Bedfordshire for three days after his age assessment, and the Iranian teenager was detained in Tinsley House immigration removal centre near Gatwick for five days. Both had arrived in the UK in poor condition after their journeys. The first said he had not eaten properly for two months, while the second said his journey by dinghy was terrifying and he arrived soaking wet and freezing cold. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, welcomed the judgment. “We are relieved that the practice of hasty decisions is no longer allowed to continue,” he said. “Distinguishing between adults and children is not something that can be done quickly; it takes time and expertise to make the right decision. “Children seeking safety arriving alone in the UK are bewildered and frightened. They have been subjected to processes with neither safeguards nor oversight, relying on little more than luck to ensure that someone identifies them as being wrongly deemed adult and helps them access the care they are entitled to. No child should have been faced with disbelief and such appalling practice.” The Home Office has been approached for comment.",News/UK news,UK judge rules age assessment of asylum seekers was unlawful,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/uk-judge-rules-that-age-assessment-of-asylum-seekers-was-unlawful
1/20/2022,"A former teacher, traveller, poet, bibliophile and enthusiastic dancer, my friend David Barnett, who has died aged 92, was for 15 years the owner of Aardvark Wholefoods in Carmarthen, known to many as “David Aardvark”. Born in Mitcham, Surrey, David was the son of Joyce, who worked for the Pearl & Dean cinema advertising company, and Bearron Barnett, the manager of a bookmaker’s. During the second world war, David was evacuated to Bedford. Later he attended Dame Alice Owen’s grammar school, in Islington, north London, and subsequently won a scholarship to study modern history at Oxford. Following his graduation in the 1950s he set out alone on a low-budget adventure to the far east, living for a time with tribal people in the forests of Northern Thailand.  Soon after his return, he met Paula Tibble, secretary at an advertising agency. They married in 1959 and immediately embarked on a further, extended, world-tour “honeymoon” adventure lasting three years, taking in India, Australia (where they arrived with only £1), Polynesia, Tahiti and Panama by cargo ship, and Mexico. Back in London, David spent 10 years teaching disadvantaged children at schools including the Charles Lamb school, Islington, where he became deputy head, a task that he found “exhilarating but ultimately exhausting”. Then, in 1978, on a visit to Wales, David spotted a wholefood shop for sale. Soon the family, now including three children, Emma, Natasha and Damian, had moved to rural west Wales where they ran Aardvark Wholefoods. David retired in 1993, but Aardvark is still going strong. For 23 years from 1989, David was a regular participant at the annual Dance Camp Wales event, where he made many enduring friendships and learned to circle-dance. I got to know David while sitting and talking late into the night around campfires there. He was also a prolific poet whose published collections included Bent in Water (1985), Fretwork (1990) and All the Year Round (1993). In 2005 and 2006, he won the PIP Gertrude Stein award for innovative poetry in English. His poem Wintergreen, written for Paula, includes the lines “Sounder now/ than then, you bring a hamper/to a pond of willows/ with their paddling roots,/ so we can picnic on/ a bed of wintergreen.” He was an avid reader of good literature, a passionate admirer of Shakespeare (claiming to have seen every play on stage at least once) and a lover of music. Indeed, David truly immersed himself in the best that life had to offer: literature, music, dance, travel, love, laughter, compassion, good company, sunshine, the exuberance of nature – and ice-cream. In 2013 he and Paula moved to Spain. Emma died in 1992. David is survived by Paula, Natasha and Damian, two grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.",Lifestyle/Food,David Barnett obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/19/david-barnett-obituary
1/20/2022,"Tracey Emin has demanded that an artwork she donated to the government’s collection be removed from 10 Downing Street, saying the “current situation is shameful”. More Passion, a neon artwork, was installed in Downing Street in 2011 when David Cameron was prime minister.  In an Instagram post on Wednesday, Emin said she was asking for it to be removed. She later told the Guardian that Boris Johnson’s “behaviour and lack of contrition” over the Downing Street parties scandal were “bizarre”. “This is my neon that hangs at 10 Downing Street. It was a gift from myself to the Government Art Collection,” she wrote on Instagram. “I am now in the process of requesting that my artwork be removed from 10 Downing Street. I feel More Passion is the last thing this present government needs. This current situation is shameful.” Cameron, who invited Emin to create an artwork after he became prime minister, hung the neon sign outside the first floor Terracotta Room, which is often used for hospitality purposes. Its position made it visible to many visitors. Emin said: “I gave [the artwork] as a gift, I’m not asking for it back. The artwork belongs to the government, not whoever’s in power right now. It could hang in the British embassy in Cairo, or go back into storage. There are many places it could go, but just right at the moment I don’t think it’s a very good idea if it’s at 10 Downing Street.” Revelations about parties in Downing Street while people were “holding funerals through their telephones” were shameful and “people were really hurt by this”. She added: “Everybody throughout society has suffered through Covid. I just find the [prime minister’s] behaviour and lack of contrition bizarre.” Emin, 58, was nominated for the Turner prize in 1999, exhibiting My Bed, an installation of her own unmade bed, featuring used condoms and blood-stained underwear. Her work has been created in a variety of media including drawing, painting, sculpture, film, photography, neon text and sewn appliqué. The Government Art Collection contains more than 14,000 works, most of which are on display in buildings in the UK and embassies across the world. It includes oil paintings, sculptures, prints, drawings, photographs, textiles and video works, mainly by British artists, dating back to the 16th century. Last year, a freedom of information request from the Spectator revealed that Johnson and his wife, Carrie, chose 44 works from the collection to display in Downing Street. They include several by Peter Blake, the pop artist who designed the cover of the Beatles’ 1967 album Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.

1/20/2022,"Downing Street’s parties during lockdown have galvanised Westminster and incensed voters, leaving Boris Johnson fighting for his political life. But amid tumbling Conservative opinion poll ratings, a MP defecting to Labour and the daily drip-feed of further revelations, one interest group has been unmoved: the financial markets. The City’s main share yardstick, the FTSE 100 index, has risen by 400 points in the past month as the prime minister’s partygate woes have worsened. Over the same period, the pound has risen by two cents against the dollar and is trading at its highest level against the euro since early 2020.  Markets have a long list of things that worry them. They are anxious about a Russian invasion of Ukraine. They are worried about the possibility of oil supplies from the Middle East being disrupted. But as far as the UK is concerned, they are more interested in the Bank of England’s response to rising inflation than whether Johnson will be replaced by Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss or a Tory dark-horse candidate. Paul Donovan, the chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, summed up the prevailing mood in the City: “Markets are unlikely to care if the prime minister resigns, as it would not be expected to signal a significant change in policy.” Nor are markets factoring in the possibility that Keir Starmer may be on course to be prime minister after the next election. Labour has a 10-point lead in the opinion polls, its biggest since 2013, when Ed Miliband was leader, but the current thinking in the City is that the Conservatives are merely suffering a bad case of midterm blues and have plenty of time to recover under a new leader and see off the challenge from Starmer. That said, assuming Johnson quits or is forced out, his successor will be in no hurry to go to the polls. The squeeze on living standards and higher tax will, if history is anything to go by, make the Conservatives unpopular and put to the test the theory that any Tory can beat Starmer. Shane O’Neill, the head of interest rate trading at Validus Risk Management, said the relaxed mood may not last, even if Sunak or Truss left government policy broadly unchanged. The markets have a strong preference towards the “devil it knows”, with inexperience and unfamiliarity breeding nerves and increased volatility in shares and the pound, he added. “So far, market reaction to the Tory scandals has been muted and we’ve remained focused on the more pressing issues of inflation and central bank action. This can change quickly and if it does, headlines from Whitehall will begin to have serious impacts on markets and hedging strategies.”",News/Business,Why the City is unfazed by Boris Johnson’s partygate woes for now,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/19/why-the-city-is-unfazed-by-boris-johnson-partygate-woes-for-now
1/20/2022,"Delaying and preventing infection as much as possible through this pandemic was a worthwhile strategy. In early 2020, there were few treatments, limited testing and no vaccines. The costs of those lockdowns were big, but the effort to buy time paid off. In that time, science has transformed Covid from a deadly virus to a much less serious, nasty disease – one that is manageable at home, for the vast majority of those vaccinated. It has, largely, defanged it. But even as we have had success treating and preventing serious infections, Sars-CoV-2 has become increasingly transmissible. ONS survey data indicates that one in 15 are positive in England, with similar numbers for the other three nations. While the good news is that the Omicron variant is resulting in less severe disease and a smaller fraction of hospitalisations, so many people are infected and isolating that critical services are struggling with staffing. This is what is driving governments to rethink isolation policies, and ask whether they are becoming more disruptive than the virus itself.  In the UK the prime minister announced today that restrictions including masking requirements will be removed from next week, and self-isolation requirements will be reviewed in March. I think this is largely reasonable – all governments face the question of how to approach this new landscape. For policymakers, it’s a bit like landing an aeroplane on an icy landing strip. The fuel of public patience is running low; and wear and tear, in the form of economic and social damage, has built up over two years in a holding pattern. The need to land is obvious, and we have the tools to do so, but it’s still a tricky feat in current conditions. There are now clearly three camps of scientists voicing opinions on what is happening and what to do in the coming weeks. This can be confusing for the public. The first group still seem to see the virus as the same deadly one of March 2020, despite the massive scientific progress in managing it, and they suggest extremely cautious measures. The second say they’ve been right all along in that mass infection is unavoidable; this is the “let it rip” group. They ignore the dramatic difference that mass vaccinations and treatments have made – avoiding serious illness from Covid-19 now is wholly different from 2020. The third group – where I sit – have evolved their position as the data and tools, namely vaccines and therapeutics, have also evolved to transform Covid-19 into something more akin to other infectious diseases that we control and manage. My analysis has consistently responded to the latest evidence. First, we now have safe and effective vaccines that protect the vast majority of people from hospitalisation and death. Recent data from the UK Health Security Agency shows that unvaccinated people are between three and eight times more likely to be hospitalised with Covid-19. Early in the Omicron wave, New Yorkers who were not vaccinated were more than eight times more likely to be hospitalised than New Yorkers who were fully vaccinated. If everyone who was offered a vaccine and booster would take it, the pandemic would be effectively over in richer countries. And while our current vaccines don’t stop us getting infected, major investment is being made in next-generation vaccines that offer sterilizing immunity, meaning they stop infection completely in those getting two doses. Next, we have exciting home treatments on the horizon for Covid-19, two in particular. The first is Pfizer’s Paxlovid and the second is Merck’s molnupiravir. Both are seen by scientists as groundbreaking because early trial data showed they significantly reduced the chances of hospitalisation and death in high-risk patients. The pills aren’t affected by new variants such as Omicron as they don’t target the spike protein where most mutations have occurred. And unlike vaccines, which must be taken weeks before infection to be effective, these treatments can help fight active infections. Antivirals need to be tied to a good diagnostic system as the pills need to be taken as soon as possible after confirming Covid-19 diagnosis and symptoms. This means we need a smooth system for getting tested, getting a prescription from a medical professional and starting the course of oral pills. Although, because of current supply issues, rather than general population use they will be targeted at older people and those who are more vulnerable due to health conditions such as heart disease, cancer or diabetes. What does all this mean in terms of living with Covid-19? We still need to test. We still need to vaccinate and combat misinformation. We need to encourage people to wear medical-grade masks such as N95s in crowded and indoor settings. Employers need to recognise and support employees who have been identified as in a shielding group. We also need to review isolation and other policies so they remain safe, but are less disruptive to the functioning of society. We will still need to monitor Covid-19 in public health, as we do other diseases. When people say it will be “endemic”, that doesn’t mean harmless. Endemic means that we accept a circulation of a disease because elimination or eradication is perceived as too difficult. Malaria, dengue and measles are endemic in certain parts of the world even though they are all serious diseases. Malaria was endemic in the United States until the government decided to eliminate it. This is part of a larger question about how much we continue to alter what “normal” social relations are, given the circulation of Sars-CoV-2. Humans are social: we need to hug, dance, sing and recognise each other’s faces and smiles. A sense of community and connection are vital to wellbeing too. Public health is not about one disease; it is broadly about wellbeing, which includes mental health and being able to pay the rent, feed your family, stay warm through winter and have a meaningful role in society. Slowing the spread of Sars-CoV-2, even stopping it completely in certain countries, helped save lives. It allowed two transformative antiviral pills to be made available. It allowed doctors to develop better ways of treating patients, and to understand what we’re facing. It allowed a better understanding of transmission and risk. But now, two years into this pandemic, we need to find a better way of living alongside Sars-CoV-2 using the tools we have. We have created ways to minimise the impact of Covid-19. And now is the time to start to recover and heal as a society and move forward, treating this virus like we do other infectious disease threats.

1/20/2022,"Christian Wakeford told Boris Johnson that the Conservatives “have shown themselves incapable of offering” the “government this country deserves”, in a parting shot as he defected to Labour. But the Bury South MP, who had submitted a letter of no confidence against the prime minister, is not the first to defect to another party due to disagreements with leadership. Here are some famous cases of MPs moving across the political spectrum.  Wakefield is not even the first MP to leave due to disagreements with Boris Johnson. The former universities minister Sam Gyimah defected to the Liberal Democrats in 2019, accusing Johnson of “veering towards populism and English nationalism”. The then MP for East Surrey said he had left the Conservatives to fight against the government’s “scorched-earth approach” to delivering Brexit, regardless of the cost to the country. Berger had been a member of the Labour party but was critical of the former leader Jeremy Corbyn. In February 2019, members of her local party briefly proposed motions of no confidence in her for “continually” criticising Corbyn. She went on to join other former Labour and Conservative MPs in forming Change UK, a pro EU party, but left this group in June 2019 to sit as an independent MP, before joining the Liberal Democrats. She stood unsuccessfully for Finchley and Golders Green in the 2019 general election. At the time she left Labour for the Lib Dems she said they were “the strongest party to stop Brexit”. I am very pleased to announce that I have joined @joswinson and the @LibDems, the strongest party to stop brexit, fight for equality and a fairer country. Gapes had been a Labour MP for 27 years but left the party due to being unhappy with the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. For Gapes, foreign policy differences were the major factor, and he accused Corbyn in his resignation letter of taking the “wrong side on so many international issues, from Russia to Syria to Venezuela.” Similarly to Berger, he joined Change UK. In the December 2019 election, Gapes was defeated by Labour’s Sam Tarry. Soubry was among a number of MPs who left their political parties due to Brexit turmoil. When she left the Conservatives she said it was because of her party’s shift to the right and support of leaving the EU. She became leader of Change UK but lost her seat in the 2019 general election, finishing a distant third. Wakefield is also not the first Tory MP to defect to Labour. In 2007 Quentin Davies made the move, “delighting” the new Labour leader Gordon Brown. The MP for Grantham and Stamford made his decision after clashing with the then Tory leader, David Cameron. He wrote that the party seemed “to have ceased collectively to believe in anything, or to stand for anything”. Cameron wrote back to Davies saying: “You have made your choice and the British people will make theirs.” The Tory MP for Rochester and Strood was among a number of Conservatives to defect to Ukip in 2014. The Eurosceptic politician said he had not taken the decision lightly but claimed the Conservative leadership was “part of the problem that is holding our country back”. His announcement came just before the Conservative party conference in Birmingham and was a blow to Cameron at the time. The defection came eight months before the general election. At the Ukip conference in Doncaster, Reckless said voters felt “ripped off and lied to”, adding: “Today I am leaving the Conservative party and joining Ukip.” He had wanted more action on a European referendum, tax and immigration.",News/Politics,MPs who moved across political spectrum,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/19/mps-who-moved-across-political-spectrum
1/20/2022,"The Vietnamese leader of a people smuggling gang has been sentenced to 15 years in a Belgian jail over the death by suffocation of 39 men, women and children transported across the Channel in a sealed trailer. Vo Van Hong, 45, was also ordered to pay a €920,000 (£760,000) fine by the court in Bruges, while prison sentences of between 18 months and 10 years were handed to 17 others for their roles in conducting a large-scale smuggling operation between Vietnam and Britain.  Those convicted were told they had cynically exploited their victims – 31 Vietnamese men and eight women, aged between 15 and 44 – who arrived dead in Grays, Essex, in October 2019. They had all died from suffocation and hyperthermia (overheating) after paying nearly €25,000 each to be transported to the UK. The victims were treated as mere cargo and described as “chickens” by their smugglers, the court heard. Customs papers said the shipment contained Vietnamese biscuits. The convictions in Belgium, where the smuggling network had been based, followed that of Eamonn Harrison, 23, a lorry driver from Northern Ireland, and Gheorghe Nica, 43, the Romanian coordinator of the operation, who were found guilty of manslaughter at the Old Bailey in London in December 2020. They were sentenced to 20 and 27 years in prison respectively. During earlier proceedings in Bruges, the court heard from Ann Lukowiak, a federal prosecutor, of the horrific scenes she saw in the back of the trailer when she travelled to Essex. “What stays with me the most is a bloody handprint on the door of the container, a silent witness to what happened on that journey,” she said. “One couple has died in each other’s arms.” Vo, who organised a total of 409 crossings to the UK and rented a safe house in Anderlecht, had the job of ensuring that those seeking to get to Britain arrived at the loading points and made their payments. He told those being smuggled to switch off their mobile phones before departure. In a 234-page verdict, Judge Bert Salembier wrote that Vo was “indisputably the leader of the Belgian cell of the criminal organisation”. The Bruges court convicted 11 people from Vietnam or of Vietnamese origin for allowing their property to be used as a meeting point, where documents or mobile phone sim cards for the victims were distributed. Six taxi drivers, who took migrants largely from Brussels to meeting points, were also convicted, including their leader, a Moroccan man who the court heard continued these activities even after the events of October 2019. He was given a seven-year prison sentence. The dead were found inside the truck container on 23 October 2019 at an industrial estate in Grays. They had crossed the Channel from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge on the ferry Clementine before arriving in Purfleet. The victims suffocated in the stifling hot weather after failing to pierce the metal container’s roof with a pole.Most of the victims were from Nghệ An and Hà Tĩnh provinces in north-central Vietnam, where poor job prospects, environmental disasters and the promise of financial reward were reasons to seek a new life in the west.

1/20/2022,"Conservative MPs have revealed their anger at the Downing Street party scandal in response to emails from concerned constituents, as support for the prime minister across the party continues to drain away. In a number of emails to constituents seen by the Guardian, Tory MPs said they were “appalled”, “embarrassed” and “disgusted” by the revelations, with many saying they were not prepared to “defend the indefensible”.  Although many MPs said they were withholding judgment until the outcome of the Sue Gray inquiry, others said they doubted any findings would be enough to restore public confidence in the leadership. Many said they had been inundated with hundreds of emails from constituents on the subject, detailing their own personal sacrifices during Covid and showing “the strength of anger and distress” over the issue. Below are some excerpts from their responses: “The multiple revelations suggest a culture of casual disregard for some of the most intrusive and restrictive rules imposed on the British public since the second world war. Everyone has a right to be angry about this. I hope the Metropolitan police will investigate these gatherings … it makes me feel extremely disappointed and genuinely let down.” “I am furious at the apparent lack of grip shown by government officials. Something has also clearly gone wrong with the political machine at No 10.” “The PM’s decision to attend [the 20 May 2020 gathering] was amazingly stupid. I expect those staff who organised or attended [the party the night before the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral] to be removed without delay. Both their judgment and level of maturity is clearly such that they have nothing worthwhile to contribute to the governance of this country. As we await the full report on events, and in all likelihood for the foreseeable future, I and many of my parliamentary colleagues will regard the prime minister as being ‘on licence’. He has behaved foolishly and is undeniably a diminished figure now.” “Personally, I found [the prime minister’s] defence that he was ignorant as to the nature of the gathering difficult to comprehend. I cannot, at present, see how [the Sue Gray] report could exonerate the prime minister and alleviate public anger. If he is found to have actively misled parliament, or if he faces criminal sanction [or both], his position is untenable and he should resign. I would hope that he would do this without the need for a formal vote of no confidence by Conservative MPs.” “It is indefensible and I have made my thoughts very clear internally. For those at the heart of government to show such a total lack of empathy and awareness to the rules is wholly irresponsible. I hope you will respect my decision to not publicly be telling anybody whether I have or have not written to Sir Graham Brady at this stage – even my wife will not know that information! But as you have seen from my previous actions, I am not a person who is appalled and takes no action.” “It was irresponsible, reckless and unacceptable and disciplinary actions, and possibly prosecutions, should follow.” “Like you, I am angry and upset to learn about this latest revelation. I want every one of these allegations to be fully and independently investigated, if necessary, by the police and I want all of those, however senior, who have broken the law or government guidance to be appropriately punished.” “I must say that I’ve been appalled. The fact that a big bash was organised the night before Prince Philip’s funeral fills me with disgust. This is not an isolated example of modest rule-breaking. It’s clear to me that whatever happens there needs to be almost a total clearout of No 10 and all of those who were in any way connected with what appear to be clear rule-breaking events need to properly be held to account.” “It is hard to believe the current stream of revelations, and I have no intention of mounting any defence. Not only am I disappointed at the behaviour of the Downing Street operation (including civil servants who should know better) but, as I have had to say too often before, events of recent months have dented my confidence in the prime minister to say the least, and I feel he has seriously let the country as a whole down.”",News/Politics,‘It is indefensible’: what Tory MPs said to constituents about partygate,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/19/it-is-indefensible-what-tory-mps-said-to-constituents-about-partygate-boris-johnson
