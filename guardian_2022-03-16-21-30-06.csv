3/16/2022,"Germany has recorded its highest rate of Covid-19 infections since the start of the pandemic, as mask-wearing mandates in shops, restaurants and schools will come to an end in many parts of the country this weekend. The country’s disease control agency on Wednesday reported a record incidence rate of 1,607 new infections per 100,000 people over the past seven days, one of the highest in Europe. Germany’s Robert Koch Institute has recorded a total of 262,593 confirmed new cases over the same time period and 269 new deaths within 24 hours. Experts say the number of cases could be even higher as testing facilities have reached full capacity and those who test positive with a lateral flow test are no longer required to carry out a PCR test that would show up in the statistics. The number of people on German intensive care wards with Covid is rising but the rate of people dying of the virus is considerably lower than during the 2020-21 winter wave. Rising infections in Germany are likely to be still driven by the Omicron variant and especially its “stealth” subvariant, BA.2, which made up almost half of all recorded cases last week. Less than 1% of infections are now due to the Delta variant. In neighbouring France, which is also recording a month-on-month rise of infection rates, the health minister, Olivier Véran, said on Wednesday the current rebound should peak by the end of the month. Véran defended France’s decision to lift most restrictions put in place to contain the pandemic as of this Monday. In Germany, the current set of Covid restrictions expires on 19 March and will be replaced with a more light-touch set of rules, seen as a compromise deal between the centre-left Social Democrats of the health minister, Karl Lauterbach, and the pro-business Free Democratic Party of justice minister Marco Buschmann. Mask-wearing will remain obligatory on public transport, hospitals and care homes but not in shops, restaurants and schools. The government is retaining an option to tighten rules – including by restricting access to nonessential shops to the unvaccinated – in hotspots experiencing dramatic surges of the virus. Some German states, including Berlin, Brandenburg and Baden-Württemberg, have decided to extend the current set of rules until the end of this month. “We are still some time off a ‘freedom day’”, said Berlin’s mayor, Franziska Giffey, on Tuesday. As of 1 April, the German capital is likely to see an end not just to most Covid-related restrictions, but to free lateral flow testing options currently provided a venues across the city. “We should be prepared to see fewer test centres in the city”, Giffey told broadcaster RBB.",News/World news,Germany hits record Covid infection rate since start of pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/germany-hits-record-covid-infection-rate-since-start-of-pandemic
3/16/2022,"Robert Peterson has been quietly grieving the death of his mother, Yong Ae Yue, in private for the last year – remembering her Korean cooking, the way she adored her grandchildren, and the pride she took in casting her vote as an American citizen. He holds on to those personal memories one year on, while many others reflect on the chilling public memory of the last moments of her life, when she was shot and killed at the spa where she worked. The 63-year-old Korean American was one of six Asian women murdered on 16 March 2021 in a shooting rampage that targeted three Atlanta-area spas. Two others were also killed in the shootings. That attack has come to symbolize a pattern of violence that emerged with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and continues to haunt Asian American communities today. Peterson did not think his mother was unsafe at the spa, where she had recently gotten a job cooking meals for the staff and cleaning, but he recalls their conversations about violent attacks against Asian Americans during the pandemic. “We talked about her being targeted [for] being Asian, with this influx of hatred,” he said. “Similarly [to] the way in which she talked about me, as a Black man, possibly being targeted if I engage with law enforcement. So, we both understood what it was like, but I guess we didn’t let fear constrain our movement.” Peterson, whose father is Black, recognizes that his mourning parallels a collective grief that weighs on Atlanta’s Asian American community. “So I always tell people, it’s not really about my mother, it is about what she represents and what these victims were.” On this anniversary of the shooting, Atlanta-based civil rights groups have organized a Community Remembrance Day calling for “healing and solidarity”; there are gatherings planned in several cities under the banner of “Break the Silence” and a “Justice for AAPI Women” rally at the Georgia state capitol. In other parts of the country, state-level legislative initiatives have focused on strengthening social protections for Asian American communities instead of policing them. Last year, California’s Asian American and Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus sponsored the Asian and Pacific Islander Equity Budget, which invests in social programs in Asian American communities, such as grassroots organizations working on violence prevention and school-based “restorative justice programs to address hate and macroaggressions early”. In New York, progressive lawmakers and civil rights groups are pushing legislation to eliminate criminal penalties for unlicensed massage workers in order to prevent what advocates decry as racially biased, often abusive policing of Asian American women. But New York has also seen more attacks against Asian American women including two recent murders and a spate of street assaults, and earlier this week, a woman allegedly beaten and called a racial slur in Yonkers, New York. These incidents have called the attention of activists yet again as they strategize how to protect and inform their communities. According to Stop AAPI Hate, a California-based coalition that tracks self-reported incidents of harassment, assault and discrimination against Asian Americans, there were 6,273 reported incidents in 2021, up from 4,632 in 2020. While it’s difficult to gauge whether incidents are actually going up or just being reported at a higher rate, the trendlines are disturbing: two-thirds of reported incidents involved verbal harassment; about one in six involved physical assault; and women and non-binary people together reported about twice as many incidents as men. A Stop AAPI Hate mental health survey, published a couple of months after the Atlanta shootings, shows that a fifth of Asian Americans victimized by racism “display signs of racial trauma”, such as anxiety, depression or hypervigilance. Some of the initial hostility may have been triggered by Trump’s anti-China rhetoric early on in the pandemic, but Stop AAPI Hate’s co-founder Russell Jeung noted that the persistence of violence under a new administration indicates that “the racism is really deep rooted, that a lot of people still continue to direct their anger and their fear coming out of the pandemic towards Asians.” Defining anti-Asian violence can be complicated. While Stop AAPI Hate’s surveys reveal a pattern of civil rights violations, according to Jeung, “only a small proportion of the racism that we’re documenting are actually crimes for which people would be arrested”. Moreover, many abuses suffered by Asian Americans might not meet the legal definition of hate crime, which generally entails an explicit motivation of prejudice. Such intent can be difficult for prosecutors to prove without clear evidence that a victim was targeted specifically due to their race. When the Atlanta-based Center for Pan Asian Community Services (CPACS) hosted community dialogue sessions in the wake of the Atlanta shootings, participants voiced feelings of longstanding trauma. CPACS’s president, Jung Ha Kim, said this was especially noticeable among people of Korean, Vietnamese, Hmong, Lao or Filipino ethnicity, which she attributes in part to the residual impact of histories of conflict in their home countries – a psychological phenomenon that researchers attribute to historical trauma ingrained in Asian migrant and refugee communities. The community dialogue has also surfaced some internal tensions. Kim believes that the spa shootings should compel the Asian American community to reckon with its own biases, as spa or massage work, which is stereotypically associated with sex work, is often dismissed as “not a respectable occupation”. The incident, she said, revealed that “even within the AAPI [Asian American Pacific Islander] community, these women, the victims, were silenced – maybe an invisible population in our own community as well”. The community remembrance actions that CPACS is coordinating, culminating in a rally for “Justice for AAPI Women” at the Georgia state capitol on the anniversary of the shooting, is an opportunity to “lift up women’s history, women’s stories in the Asian American community to remember these victims. So this gender issue, and the intersectionality of class and race, needs to be talked about”. Although attacks have prompted local and federal politicians to call for strengthening law enforcement responses to hate crimes – including an anti-hate-crime bill passed by Congress weeks after the spa shooting – progressive Asian American organizations have focused on non-carceral approaches to public safety, particularly in light of the Black Lives Matter protests against police brutality and institutional anti-Black racism. After the shooting, the civil rights group Advancing Justice Atlanta and about 2,000 other organizations issued a statement urging policymakers to focus not on policing but rather, on “addressing our communities’ immediate needs, including in-language support for mental health, legal, employment, and immigration services”. Phi Nguyen, Advancing Justice Atlanta’s executive director, cautioned that the structural violence that Asian American communities face may be overlooked amid headlines about individuals being victimized. Immigration policies that lead to detention and deportation, for example, do not elicit the same public shock as a mass shooting, but are nonetheless experienced as a form of state-based trauma in Asian American communities. In response to interpersonal racial violence, Nguyen said, “sometimes the kneejerk reaction is to call for increased policing and greater fortification and reliance on the criminal legal system. But these are systems that have been historically racist and have not really facilitated safety for Black and brown communities, so I think that we, as a community, need to think about: what are the solutions that can bring safety to all of our communities, our Asian American communities and also Black and brown communities?” Margaret Chin, a sociologist at Hunter College, said that to address the root causes of anti-Asian racism, policymakers need to understand the history of Asian Americans, which is fraught with exclusionary immigration policy, mob violence and segregation, as well as the sexual objectification of Asian women in popular culture. It starts with education: most of the youth who will become future leaders in their communities, she noted, “have not been exposed to Asian American studies at all” in school or college. “They don’t know how these [issues] actually affect our society … if everybody has this as part of their education, I think that we might have a different outcome right now.” Peterson, who is a medical sociologist, said both systemic and interpersonal violence against Asian Americans “can’t be fixed [by] putting this one perpetrator in jail or dealing with a particular criminal act, but it’s going to take a social response, an institutional response”. That includes not just education but also encouraging the community to “speak up … and be seen and heard, tell our story and listen to other stories”. He tells his own mother’s story to illustrate how his family, which bridges Atlanta’s Black and Asian American communities, reflects both the complexity and the commonality of their American heritage. “What I think people relate to [in] my mother and these other women and victims is that what they wanted was universal. My mother just wanted to work and provide for her family,” he said. “My message is that my mother was my mother, but she also could have been your mother.”",News/US news,‘She could have been your mother’: anti-Asian racism a year after Atlanta spa shootings,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/16/anti-asian-racism-atlanta-spa-shootings-anniversary

3/16/2022,"Romantic love and family dynamics might be the staples of literature, but fictional friendships have provided readers with some of the most enduring, and memorable, pairings – and none more so than the toxic variety. Complex love/hate relationships have inspired novelists from Thackeray to Ferrante, and are the engine that drives many recent thrillers, including Ottessa Moshfegh’s Eileen and Tara Isabella Burton’s Social Creature. In my debut novel, The House Guest, 25-year-old Kate strikes up an unlikely friendship with Della, a life coach a decade older. Their uneven alliance is put to the test when Della invites Kate to join her family for a summer in France, cutting the younger woman off from everyone she knows as events spiral out of her control. Put under the microscope, friendships are uniquely fascinating – free from familial duty or, usually, from sexual desire. We choose our friends, and yet they can have great sway over our lives, holding up a mirror, providing support, but also exerting an influence that can be hard to unravel. These novels of toxic friendship explore much more than just cruelty or manipulation – their characters are caught up in a tangle of co-dependency and intimacy, affection and deception. 1. Cat’s Eye by Margaret AtwoodWhen painter Elaine returns to Toronto for a retrospective of her work, she is assailed by memories from her past and the friendships that blighted her childhood, in particular with Cordelia, who taunts and bullies her “as if she’s driven by the urge to see how far she can go”. But who really held the power in that relationship, and what gives early friendships their unique hold over our lives? Atwood explores these destructive dynamics with customary insight and brilliance. As Elaine reflects, years after she has lost touch with Cordelia, even though they have tormented one another, “We are like the twins in old fables, each of whom has been given half a key.” 2. The Neapolitan Quartet by Elena FerranteFerrante’s Neapolitan novels tell the story of another pair of friends whose lives are inextricably entwined over decades. From their poverty-stricken childhood in postwar Naples, to their diverging paths through education, work, marriage and children, Elena and Lila are bound together in a feverish dance of competition and compassion, jealousy and love. More complex than toxic, their relationship nonetheless brings them both misery as well as solace. The pair may have spent their whole lives locked in rivalry, but it is Elena who gets the final word, as she sits down to write their story: “We’ll see who wins this time.” 3. Sula by Toni MorrisonIn Morrison’s 1973 novel, it is a man who causes the rupture between childhood friends Nel and Sula. Growing up in Medallion, a fictional black community in Ohio, after the first world war, the two girls are inseparable. Though she’s very different in nature to the transgressive Sula, for Nel, “Talking to Sula had always been a conversation with herself”. Life is hard for women in Medallion, yet while the friendship survives a number of traumas, it is Sula’s sexual betrayal of Nel that causes the irreparable rift. It is only looking back later in life that Nel reassesses what has been the most important relationship of her life. 4. Lord of the Flies by William GoldingBoys have toxic friendships too, of course, and in Golding’s 1954 debut, the young survivors of a plane crash first form alliances, and then turn on each other, in a classic exploration of group dynamics and social hierarchies. Through the now classic tale of Ralph, Jack, Piggy and Simon, Golding reveals just how quickly the social contract can break down under pressure, how friends can become rivals and finally sworn enemies, with disastrous results. 5. The Secret History by Donna TarttTartt’s bestselling first novel tells the story of another murderous group of friends, this time pushed to the edge by the secret, ritualistic behaviour of their university clique. When he joins a select group of classics students at a Vermont college, Richard is captivated. But as we know from the outset of the novel, one of their number will ultimately die. Tartt’s skill is in building up the pace and tension as she unravels how these privileged college students drive each other to destruction. 6. The Girls by Emma ClineThe group here are led astray by a charismatic leader, in the form of Manson figure Russell Hadrick. It is 1969, and restless 14-year-old Evie is lured into his gang of followers by the captivating Suzanne, both her enabler and ultimately her saviour. While many authors and film-makers have attempted to capture Manson’s seductive charm, it is in evoking the heady world of the girls around him that the power of Cline’s novel lies. 7. Passing by Nella LarsenFirst published in 1929, Larsen’s novel centres on the friendship between Irene and Clare, who grew up together in Harlem. When they are reunited as adults, Irene is dismayed to discover that her beautiful friend Clare is now “passing” as white, and is prepared to tolerate her husband’s racism. Irene, meanwhile, has married locally and is part of the Negro Welfare League. When Clare begins to spend more time with the family, Irene becomes suspicious of her friend’s motives. Why has Clare been drawn back into the culture she abandoned, and will the destructive jealousy between the pair lead one of them to betrayal? 8. Vanity Fair by William ThackeraySurely one of the archetypal manipulators, Becky Sharp uses her considerably less charismatic friend Amelia Sedley to secure a place in a society from which she would otherwise be excluded. Determined to marry well and escape her penniless beginnings, Becky navigates her way through the upper classes, with little thought for her friend’s feelings – or anyone else’s for that matter. An early example of the toxic friend as understudy and ultimately usurper. 9. The Talented Mr Ripley by Patricia HighsmithEven more ruthless and amoral is Tom Ripley, though in Highsmith’s 1955 novel the friend he latches on to is the far more glamorous and attractive Dickie Greenleaf. As Tom is drawn ever deeper into Dickie’s world, he becomes jealous and obsessed. Another usurper, Tom starts by copying the richer, more upper class Dickie’s hair, clothes and expressions – and ends by taking his life. 10. Notes on a Scandal by Zoë HellerOn the face of it, Sheba’s friendship with fellow teacher and confidante Barbara is her salvation. When Sheba begins an affair with a 15-year-old pupil, the much older and solitary Barbara offers more than just a shoulder to cry on – she eventually moves in with Sheba, shielding her from the world. But what are Barbara’s motives in helping her disgraced friend – and who, ultimately, is in control of the story? A modern classic of toxic friendship and betrayal.

3/16/2022,"Oatmeal cookies have always carried with them the unattractive whiff of the “healthy option” for me. They seemed like the kind of thing you’d get in your packed lunch instead of a Penguin. Those raisins, which so easily could have been chocolate chips yet inexplicably weren’t, were the final insult for anyone hoping for an actual treat. Reader, I’ve been unfair. Turns out oatmeal cookies can be utterly delicious … as long as you live near an American bakery or make them yourself. Good as we are at many and various oat biscuits, I’ve never had a British cookie to match up to the recipes I’ve tried this week, all of which hail from across the pond, where the idea as we know it seems to have appeared around the same time as commercial oat brands. Simultaneously crisp and chewy, the cookies below are best enjoyed fresh, which is why they’re worth making yourself. Oh, and I was also wrong about them being a health food. Sorry about that. For a country that once largely subsisted on them, the UK has become remarkably narrow-minded in its choice of oats – or perhaps it’s just that the supermarkets have decided we’re only interested in convenience. My local shop carries 26 sorts of “porridge oats” (made from steamed rolled oats) and instant porridge, made from oats that have been rolled more thinly and steamed for longer, but no oatmeal, which is made from chopped raw oat groats. Sometimes known as steel-cut or Irish oats, oatmeal takes longer to cook, but is, I think, more interesting to eat. (It also contains more fibre.) Most of the recipes I try agree with the folks at Cook’s Illustrated magazine, however, that “old-fashioned rolled oats” (that is, porridge oats) have the best “texture and flavour”. Hoping to put this to the test, I find one highly-rated recipe using instant oats on the Buttermilk by Sam baking blog – indeed, she cautions readers that “it’s important to use the right type of oats for these … if you use old-fashioned rolled oats, the cookies will spread. Avoid steel-cut oats of any type” – and another, from pastry chef Stella Parks’ book BraveTart, that uses steel-cut oats as well as the rolled variety. The main difference as far as cookies are concerned is the oats’ willingness to soak up moisture: the precooked instant oats soften immediately, which means that, as Sam cautions her readers, any dough involving them should be baked immediately, before it dries out. Conversely, doughs using rolled oats, which are chunkier and only partially cooked, will benefit from being allowed to sit for a while, so they can absorb the moisture in the butter and eggs. Melissa Weller’s recipe, from her book A Good Bake, recommends leaving it for four days before baking to achieve “the perfect texture, slightly crispy around the edges with a chewy centre”. Weller’s are certainly the most satisfying texturally, dense in a wholesome kind of a way, and less crumbly and scone-like than the similarly plump versions from Elif Yamangil of the Plenty Sweet blog, who says that, while you can chill the dough for an hour, she bakes it immediately. (Note: this is not to disparage her biscuits, reverse engineered from Cape Cod’s cult Kayak Cookies’ salty oat version, which are refreshingly light in both texture and sugar content in comparison with the seven other recipes I try for this piece.) Parks’ handful of oatmeal gives her recipe a satisfyingly nubbly, chewy texture that makes it clear who the headline star is in these cookies. You could leave it out in favour of an extra handful of rolled oats, but in my opinion it’s well worth tracking some down for this. (It also makes great porridge.) With the exception of Yamangil, who suggests white wholewheat flour (which appears to be what we’d call wholemeal flour), all the recipes I try use the plain type, either with bicarbonate of soda (Parks, Weller, Sam, Sebastien Rouxel’s Bouchon Bakery version and “Ruth’s oatmeal crisps” from the New York Times Cookbook); baking powder (Cooks Illustrated) or both (the luxury oatmeal cookies from Rose Levy Beranbaum’s the Baking Bible) to give the cookies a bit of height. I don’t want mine to be too puffy, so I’m going to stick with bicarb alone, but I will, like Parks, be replacing some of the wheat flour with oat flour, for extra oaty oomph. You’ll find this in healthfood shops, or online, or you can make it yourself by whizzing up oats in a food processor until finely ground. Almost all the recipes use a mixture of soft brown and white sugars. As Fine Cooking magazine explains, the former “makes cookies moister and chewier than does white sugar. That’s because it contains molasses … [which add] moisture and, because it’s slightly acidic, causes the proteins in cookie dough to firm up faster, creating a chewier texture.” Parks adds that this acid also reacts with the baking soda to give a thicker, puffier cookie, which explains why the recipes that use more brown than white sugar –as Keller, Beranbaum and Weller do – seem to spread a bit less than those that use equal parts of both, such as Ruth’s New York Times Cookbook recipe that nevertheless won the cookie contest at the 1966 Kentucky State Fair. There are two exceptions: Sam uses just brown sugar and Yamangil just white. I miss the thin, crisp edges that white sugar gives the other cookies in the former, and the flavour of brown in the latter, but they stand as proof that either will yield satisfactory results. I’m a fan of a chewy, damp cookie with a toffee-ish flavour, however, so I’m going to go big on brown sugar, with just enough white for that all-important crunch. Butter, for me, is a must: the plant variety I use in Ruth’s state fair-conquering cookie just can’t compete on taste, though the texture is extremely moreish – indeed, the recipe is prefaced by the claim that it is “a great example of the power of shortening … in cookies. Butter would be too heavy and the cookies wouldn’t be quite as crisp and chewy”. I do like the crispness – they spread so much, they’re halfway between a flapjack and a brittle – but when it comes down to it, I prefer the richness that dairy brings. Eggs, meanwhile, according to Parks, are the unsung best supporting actors here: “If butter and sugar are the stars of the cookie show, then an egg is craft services, dutifully showing up to provide the fuel everyone else needs to get the job done: plenty of water, some lecithin [a powerful emulsifier], fat, and protein.” Adding an extra yolk, as Weller suggests, seems to give her cookies, like Sam’s, a soft, dense, almost fudgy texture that is very popular with my testers; the extra fat, Parks explains, hinders “both gluten development and aeration”. I’m also with Parks when she suggests swapping “traditional raisins for tart dried cranberries or cherries. They balance out the sweetness of the cookies so much better.” But then, I’m not a big fan of raisins in general, which you may wish to take into account. Rouxel recommends soaking the fruit in warm water before use to plump it up, if necessary, which is a good idea, particularly for the ones on top, which will be exposed to the full heat of the oven. Note that, like Sam, you could also add chocolate chips to your cookies, or indeed chopped nuts for a change of texture; I particularly like the bitterness of Levy Beranbaum’s walnuts, but Adkins’ buttery pecans also work well. “What makes this cookie really special,” Levy Beranbaum writes in her introduction, “is that instead of adding rolled oats and nuts to the dough, I make my own granola. The oats and nuts get tossed with just enough brown sugar and maple syrup to sweeten them lightly, and then they are baked at a very low temperature to crisp and infuse them with the sweetener and fully bring out their flavour.” The granola recipe, she says, comes from Caitlin Williams Freeman of San Francisco Moma and Blue Bottle Coffee, and gives her cookies a very satisfying internal crunch, but I’d be tempted to class them as granola cookies rather than classic oatmeal. She, like many others, uses both cinnamon and vanilla as flavourings – indeed, Rouxel sticks in a whopping tablespoon of the former, which appeals mostly to the Americans I deploy as testers; I certainly find it a bit much. By all means add cinnamon if you’re a fan, but personally I, like Cook’s Illustrated, think it overpowers the oats. They substitute nutmeg, but I’m going to stick with vanilla, which I find a more harmonious pairing with the butter and brown sugar, but, again, optional. Salt, however, is not: it helps to balance the sugar needed to achieve a satisfactory texture, which is why I’m also, like Yamangil, going to finish the cookies with an extra sprinkle of the stuff. Feel free to omit this if you’re less of a salt fiend. Cook’s Illustrated recommends “shaping the dough into two-inch balls (rather than dropping the meagre rounded tablespoon called for in most recipes) [to] help keep the cookies more moist and chewy”. Larger cookies are desirable here, to maximise the contrast between the soft middle and the crunchy edges, but perhaps not quite as large as Rouxel’s, which fill a plate. Then again, each to their own.

3/16/2022,"Baker Mayfield thanked Browns fans and the city of Cleveland on the same day the team met with Deshaun Watson, his potential replacement. “With many uncertainties, here is where my head and heart is,” Mayfield wrote on social media on Tuesday evening in a message addressed to Cleveland. With many uncertainties, here is where my head and heart is. pic.twitter.com/psipN96cmh “The past 4 years have been nothing short of truly life changing since I heard my name called in the draft to go to Cleveland. This is not a message with hidden meaning. This is strictly to thank the city of Cleveland for embracing my family and me. We have made many memories and shared growing in this process through all the ups and downs.” The Browns drafted Mayfield with the No 1 overall pick in the 2018 draft after a brilliant career at Oklahoma, during which he won the Heisman Trophy. But while the 26-year-old has hardly been a failure in Cleveland, the Browns have not made a deep playoff run with Mayfield under center despite having a team packed with talent on both sides of the ball. The 2021 season was particularly disappointing, with the Browns failing to make the postseason and Mayfield struggling after suffering an injury in his non-throwing shoulder. In contrast, the Browns’ divisional rivals, the Cincinnati Bengals, reached the Super Bowl with another young No 1 overall pick, Joe Burrow, at quarterback. Browns general manager Andrew Berry and head coach Kevin Stefanski have insisted that Mayfield remains their starting quarterback. But that situation appears to have changed when a grand jury decided last week that Watson should not face criminal charges over allegations of sexual misconduct with massage therapists. Watson still faces civil charges in the case. The grand jury’s decision has led to teams including the Browns, Atlanta Falcons, Carolina Panthers and New Orleans Saints to pursue Watson, who has been pressing to leave the Houston Texans for some time. The 26-year-old Watson is the same age as Mayfield but has had a far better career on the field. He has the highest completion rate of all time among NFL quarterbacks with more than 1,500 passes, led the league in passing yards in 2020 and has been to three Pro Bowls. ESPN reported on Tuesday that the Browns had flown to Houston to persuade Watson he should waive his no-trade clause to move to Cleveland. If Mayfield goes to the Texans as part of a trade, he would be returning to the state where he grew up. “I have no clue what happens next, which is the meaning behind the silence I have had during the duration of this process. I can only control what I can, which is trusting in God’s plan throughout this process. I have given this franchise everything I have,” Mayfield added in his statement on social media. “That is something I’ve always done at every stage, and at every level. And that will not change wherever I take my next snap. Whatever happens ... I just want to say thank you to the fans who truly embraced who I am and the mentality that aligned so well with this city’s hard working people. “Cleveland will always be a part of Emily [Mayfield’s wife] and my story. And we will always be thankful for the impact it has had and will have in our lives. Sincerely, Baker Reagan Mayfield.”",Sport/Sport,Baker Mayfield thanks Cleveland as Browns meet with Deshaun Watson,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/16/baker-mayfield-cleveland-browns-possible-trade-deshaun-watson-houston-texans-nfl-football
3/16/2022,"Paris could offer “autonomy” to Corsica, the French government has said, suggesting the state might be willing to loosen its historic, centralised grip on the Mediterranean island as it struggles to calm violent protests. “We are ready to go as far as autonomy – there you go, the word has been said,” the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, told the regional newspaper Corse Matin before a two-day visit, that comes after two weeks of rioting in which 100 people were injured and public buildings and police were attacked with homemade explosive devices. But Darmanin added that “there can be no dialogue while violence is going on”. He said: “A return to calm is an essential condition.” It is unprecedented for a French government minister to suggest offering autonomy for Corsica, an island of 330,000 people that lies closer to Italy than mainland France. The birthplace of Napoleon Bonaparte has been French since the 18th century and while its status and calls for more independence has long vexed Paris, they have been brushed under the carpet by successive French presidents. The protests on the island have created a major government crisis with just weeks before April’s presidential election. The 40-year Corsican “national liberation” campaign of bombing and violence targeting French infrastructure, calmed in 2014 when armed separatists announced an “end to military operations”. Since then, Corsican nationalists seeking greater autonomy from the French state have been boosted by election successes at local and regional levels, but Emmanuel Macron is seen as having failed to move on the issue during his presidency and autonomist and nationalist Corsicans alike are frustrated that the issue of reforming the island’s status has been on ice since 2018. The protests broke out two weeks ago after a savage prison attack on a key jailed nationalist, Yvan Colonna, who was being held at a mainland French prison. He is in a coma after another prisoner, who was serving a nine-year sentence for planning terrorist attacks, attempted to strangle him in an exercise area. Colonna was serving a life sentence for murder for being part of a group who assassinated Claude Érignac, the French state’s top official in Corsica, in 1998. He had been arrested in 2003 after a five-year manhunt that eventually found him living as a shepherd in the Corsican mountains. The prison attack on Colonna stoked anger on the island, where some see him as a hero in a fight for independence from France. Demonstrations and riots have been continuing since the attack on Colonna on 2 March, which protesters blamed on the French government. Thousands have taken to the streets. Placards at demonstrations at the weekend said: “French government murderers.” On the edge of demonstrations, hundreds of hooded protesters have thrown projectiles, molotov cocktails and homemade explosive devices at police and public buildings. Prosecutors said 102 people were injured on Sunday during clashes in Corsica’s second-largest city, Bastia. Of the injured, 77 were police. The chief prosecutor of Bastia told AFP the city had witnessed “extremely violent” scenes and the SG police union said officers were dealing with a “quasi-insurrectional” situation. The government had already tried to soothe nationalist anger by removing the special prisoner status from Colonna and two of his group – which had prevented them from being transferred to a Corsican jail. That could allow for their transfer to a prison on Corsica rather than the French mainland – a key, longstanding nationalist demand for all prisoners they see as “political”. But it has not calmed the protests. Darmanin, who was to meet elected officials in the Corsican capital, Ajaccio, said Colonna had been attacked in prison by a jihadist fellow inmate over “blasphemy” in “a clearly terrorist” act. “This talk of a crime by the state is excessive, not to say intolerable,” he told Corse Matin. Gilles Simeoni, the pro-autonomy president of Corsica’s regional council, and a former lawyer for Colonna, said it was important that “the interior minister, in the name of the prime minister, and probably the president, says publicly today that the government and the state are ready to enter into a historic discussion”. No details have been given by the government but a discussion could examine an autonomous status in which Corsica takes charge of certain legislative powers, such as taxation, local economic development, and housing issues on the island known for the high number of holiday homes owned by non-Corsicans. An Ifop poll published on Sunday in Corse Matin found that 53% of those questioned favoured a degree of autonomy for Corsica, with 35% favouring the island’s outright independence from France. Macron’s opponents in the French presidential race – which polls show he will win – said the rioting and public order crisis had led Macron to move on the Corsica issue. Valérie Pécresse said it showed that Macron “gives in to violence”. She said public order must be restored in Corsica before any negotiations take place.",News/World news,France may offer Corsica ‘autonomy’ as it struggles to quell protests,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/france-may-offer-corsica-autonomy-struggles-quell-protests

3/16/2022,"Every March, Silicon Valley executives, Wall Street investors, hackers, digital designers and other creatives meet in Austin, Texas, to discuss the future of the internet. Most years, this involves various panels forecasting social media trends, startups promoting themselves for increased funding, and endless debates around how useful tech companies actually are to society. This year, however, there seemed to be only one subject on most people’s lips: the “Creator Economy”. Indeed, at this year’s South by Southwest festival, there were dozens of panels on it, ranging from giving content creators “Autonomy” to how brands can get in on it too. Much like NFTs, Crypto and Web3, the “Creator Economy” feels like a phenomenon without an obvious root, on which marketing agencies, PR firms and the tech industry have become fixated. Some argue that the term has a long history, harking back to the early days of the internet, when Stanford Engineering professor Paul Saffo used the phrase to refer to animators and illustrators, in what he considered to be a new, wholly digital economy. In recent years, however, the term has been liberally used by Silicon Valley tech CEOs and venture capital funds, in reference to content creators such as YouTubers and podcasters earning money through a hybrid of brand partnerships, ad revenue and subscription platforms such as Patreon, as well as influencers on consumer facing platforms advertising products and services directly through TikTok and Instagram. The future of the internet? To tech CEOs like Li Jin, founder of investment fund Atelier Ventures, the “Creator Economy” is the foundation upon which a new version of the Internet will be built. She explains in the New Yorker that “anyone whose fame stems from online channels, if they are able to earn income through that influence, I consider that to be the creator economy”. To Jin, such a structure should be welcomed, on the basis that it gives creators more control and freedom over their work, and would open the internet up to more creative possibilities.One problem in interrogating this vision of a “Creator Economy” is its vagueness. Most of us can get our heads around considering YouTubers who film, edit and publish videos to be “creators”, as might we apply that term to podcasters, or to visual artists putting their work on to Etsy. But it becomes more difficult to apply this understanding to other kinds of creative work – for example, streamers who take small cash donations through live broadcasts on Twitch, or journalists who turn to platforms like Substack as a source of stable income rather than the precarity of a standard newsroom. Moreover, the tile of “creator” tends to be given to individuals who are the public face of content – meaning that those who, for example, design thumbnails for YouTube videos, fix the sound quality on podcasts, or even manage the upload schedules of big influencers, tend not to be seen as “creators”, or much considered by VCs hoping to cash in on the “Creator Economy”. Art optimised for the algorithmTo my mind, though, the second problem is how this idea hands tech platforms the power to decide what counts as “valuable” creative work, which often has far less to do with artistic merit than a creator’s personal investment in the tech itself. I’m grateful to be able to make a portion of my income through podcasting and streaming on Patreon, but I’m also aware that much of this is a result of having an existing media profile which makes my work more discoverable to the public. As someone who has spent much of my career producing online content for various outlets, I have an expert knowledge of what kinds of content garners attention on different social media platforms. In that way, much actual creative work itself is secondary. The primary focus is optimising that work so that platforms notice and promote it. This means that independent creatives lacking resources will often struggle against their wealthier counterparts, or that creators producing content that some major platforms have unclear rules on – for example, adult content creators on OnlyFans – have to constantly navigate changes in rules and regulations, as well as sudden algorithmic changes, all of which will have a significant impact on their income. While some platforms might make it easier to publish content to personalised audiences – making the process of earning money easier – the “Creator Economy”, far from liberating digital content producers, further binds them to the commercial logics of tech platforms. Consequently, creators, far from having financial stability, are forced into further precarious gig work, incentivised to create content that platforms demand in order to make a living. It is unclear how the “Creator Economy” will look like in the future, where predictions about a functional ‘Web3’ system have ranged from hyper-localised patronage networks to creators having their own micro social media platforms. What’s missing in all these visions, however, is a framework in which creatives get a better deal out of their work, or, more broadly, how a new version of the internet might make producing art sustainable. As Jathan Sadowski, an academic and host of the Tech & Political Economy podcast This Machine Kills points out, far from freeing artists from the shackles of corporate tech firms, the “Creator Economy” amplifies its worst excesses and, in doing so, “perfectly mirrors” another type of economic system: capitalism.
