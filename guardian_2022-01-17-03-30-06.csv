1/17/2022,"Virginia’s newly elected Republican governor has immediately passed a swath of conservative orders – ranging from attempts to alter local school curriculums to loosening public health mandates during the pandemic – after being sworn into office on Saturday. Glenn Youngkin, a former private equity CEO who has never served in public office before, became the state’s first Republican governor since 2010 after a closely watched gubernatorial election last year.  The 55 year-old placed the issue of critical race theory (CRT) at the centre of his campaign, capitalizing on a conservative backlash against the discipline and pledging to ban teaching of it in Virginia’s schools. Critical race theory is an academic practice that examines the ways in which racism operates in US laws and society. On Saturday, after taking the oath of office, Youngkin unveiled a list of nine executive orders and two executive directives, with the first on the list described as a directive to “restore excellence in education by ending the use of divisive concepts, including Critical Race Theory, in public education”. The order lists 13 instructions, many directed to the state’s school superintendent, who has been tasked with reviewing the state’s curriculum and policies within the department of education, to identify “inherently divisive concepts”. The order also bans an executive employee from “directing or otherwise compelling students to personally affirm, adopt, or adhere to inherently divisive concepts”. The order does not define “divisive concepts” but cites critical race theory as an example. At least 22 other states have moved towards imposing limits on the teaching of critical race theory in recent months, as rightwing media in the US continues to fuel disinformation about the teaching of the previously little-known discipline. Despite the sweeping and ambiguous language, the governor’s power to intervene in local school districts is limited. And although Virginia’s general assembly has the power to compel school boards to adopt specific policy via legislation, state Democrats hold a slim majority in the Senate, meaning new laws are unlikely. On Saturday, senior state Democrats told local media they planned to block much of the new governor’s agenda. The sweeping executive orders also included loosening of public health mandates, aimed at slowing the spread of Covid-19 during the coronavirus pandemic. Youngkin’s second order eliminated mask ordinances for pupils in the state’s schools, while his last executive directive abolished vaccine mandates for state employees. Like many other areas of the US, Virginia continues to see a surge in Covid cases as the omicron variant rips through the country. Cases are up 288% in comparison to last winter’s surge, according to the New York Times. The current seven day positivity rate sits at over 35%, according to the state health department. 15,803 have died in the state from the virus since the pandemic began.",News/US news,Glenn Youngkin bans critical race theory on day one as Virginia governor,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/16/virginia-governor-glenn-youngkin-sworn-into-office-critical-race-theory
1/17/2022,"This Sunday, culture secretary Nadine Dorries tweeted out a death sentence for one of the most respected and popular broadcasters in the world. “This licence fee announcement will be the last,” she wrote, along with a link to the Mail on Sunday’s splash. “The days of the elderly being threatened with prison sentences and bailiffs knocking on doors, are over. Time now to discuss and debate new ways of funding, supporting and selling great British content.” She was doing her master’s bidding, as Boris Johnson thrashes around for anything to shift the narrative away from his own tumbling fortunes. Johnson demands “red meat” to mollify his MPs, who are in savage mood after a harrowing weekend in their constituencies listening to local people demanding his head on a plate. Axing the BBC is easy pickings, he thinks. But he may turn out to be as wrong about that as he is on just about everything else.  Thus spoke a Tory MP I talked to on Sunday, rolling their eyes in despair: “Here’s yet another national institution Boris wants to bring down with him, slashing and burning as he goes.” But will they speak out? No, not a single Tory MP dares back the BBC publicly yet, even if what some say in private is another matter. Will this assault on the corporation be as popular as Johnson imagines? That depends partly now on the BBC’s boldness in reminding people of its national worth, including what good value everyone gets for 43p a day. With such a weak government so blatantly looking for scapegoats, the broadcaster has no need to be craven. The Brexit promise was of “Global Britain”, yet Johnson is wrecking all the soft powers to make that possible. The BBC is trusted and admired for the honesty of its news across the world, especially in countries where reliable journalism may be hard to come by. Its best programmes are our best ambassadors. Britain’s influence has been deliberately vandalised by Conservatives who talk mindlessly of “patriotism” while demolishing all the vehicles of national pride abroad: foreign aid has been cut right back, while the British Council – almost as old as the BBC – is to close 20 offices around the world. British academic influence has been battered by the needless withdrawal from the Erasmus programme, and scientists are locked out of Horizon research funding. Now the BBC is mortally threatened – just as, in the words of the University of Westminster’s Steven Barnett, its global reach is poised to “hit a weekly figure of half a billion people in its centenary year”. The BBC is often considered the most respected media outlet in the world, with the World Service reaching 279 million people a week and the BBC News website the world’s most visited. What wouldn’t other countries give for such soft power? Instead, this global asset is tossed aside in the ideological mayhem created by this strange generation of nation-destroying Tories. Mesmerised by the noise made by its detractors in the rightwing press, Johnson thinks the BBC is some preserve of the metropolitan liberal elite. But he may find that he is actually being deceived by his own echo chamber, increasingly detached from the world outside. The likes of Defund the BBC, the TaxPayers’ Alliance and the Institute of Economic Affairs attack this emblem of British culture, yet never identify their funders, so who knows who or what they represent – business or governments at home or abroad? On Christmas Day, eight out of the 10 most watched programmes were on BBC One, with a record 141m programmes streamed on BBC iPlayer between 27 December and 3 January. The broadcaster is used by 90% of adults and 80% of 18- to 34-year-olds a week, according to the National Audit Office, making it by far the most used media brand in the UK. Leave it to the US streaming giants and there would be little British content, just a monoculture of globalised programming. Who would pay for its news, or children’s programmes or the BBC Bitesize Education service that was used by 5.8 million children during lockdown? How would we pay for the immeasurable riches of BBC radio or the regional stations that are one of the last bastions of local reporting? When I speak to the shadow culture secretary, Lucy Powell, she jumps to defend the BBC Charter. The organisation has suffered cuts of 30% since 2010, and worse is to come following Dorries’s announcement of a funding freeze. The entire edifice is demolished just “because they don’t like its journalism”, Powell says. The Mail on Sunday article noted that government figures were “incensed” by the corporation’s reporting of Johnson’s partygate scandals – but the most outspoken coverage has come from the Tory press itself. Powell, as a Manchester MP, points to the “levelling up” effect that the BBC has on the country, with its operations in Salford, Cardiff and around the country. No other broadcaster would put more than half its jobs and producers outside London The licence fee is not the only viable way to pay for it: possible alternatives might be a household tax, as in France and Germany; but it certainly shouldn’t be looking for funds in the Treasury’s pot, as it would then be left to compete in every budget with the NHS and defence. The principle that matters is that everyone pays in, so it costs far less for a panoply of programming right across the taste spectrum than could ever be funded by subscriptions from a few. If the BBC, and its users, make a trenchant and confident case for what everyone would lose without it, it will survive and thrive. So the country has to ask itself what it values most: a great national broadcaster with such a wealth of programmes at the cheapest rate, or the political posturing of a lame-duck prime minister?

1/17/2022,"The good news is that energy prices will be coming down. The bad news is nobody knows when for sure. The UK’s biggest energy supplier, Centrica, says high gas and electricity prices could last for another two years. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reckons that’s too optimistic. Expensive bills are a problem for firms, consumers and the government. Households could face a doubling of annual energy bills to £2,400 a year from October - a cost-of-living catastrophe for millions. While Labour proposes a support package, Conservative ministers have said little – fuelling suspicions that they intend to reduce demand for energy by making people poorer. Carbon-based energy will fade, but it won’t disappear completely. To keep temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the IEA says the world in 2050 would have to use about half as much natural gas as today and about one-quarter as much oil. British policymakers must wake up to the security implications of greening the economy. Britain replaced coal-fired plants with wind power to reduce carbon emissions, becoming dependent on natural gas imports – especially in calm weather. Traditional suppliers like Russia might see opportunities in volatile fossil fuel prices that result from the transition to net zero. This is not reassuring. Fuel price protests sparked unrest in Kazakhstan this month, but they also brought Britain to a halt 22 years ago.  Britain should look to John Maynard Keynes for answers. The basic fault of commodity markets, he saw, was the private sector’s failure to make effective use of stockpiling. Keynes proposed government storage of raw materials and foodstuffs to stabilise prices – by buying up essentials from world markets when they were cheap and selling them to consumers when they were dear. In 1942, he went further to propose an international system of buffer stocks to limit the fluctuation of the prices of key commodities. Keynes showed that buffer stocks could secure macroeconomic stability. His proposals were adopted partially by the United States, and others, after the second world war – becoming a defining feature of the golden age of capitalism. Producing and consuming countries have conflicting interests when it comes to key commodities but they share an interest in stable prices as a pre-condition for sustained investment. Keynes saw a pricing policy as a solution to high, unstable prices. This makes sense but is anathema to current economic thought. Britain closed its last big gas storage facility in 2017, a shortsighted decision by Centrica that left the country able to store only 2% of its annual demand. Other big gas importers, by contrast, can store at least 20%. As the economist Isabella Weber notes, the orthodox view today is that the state should put “free prices” above welfare considerations. History suggests that this is about politics, not economics. Ms Weber, in her book How China Escaped Shock Therapy, speculates that Keynes may have been inspired by ancient Chinese economic thinking on smoothing grain prices. A mixture of extreme weather, rising demand, post-pandemic economic nationalism and spiking energy prices will have profound effects. In Britain, post-Brexit economic barriers will also push up the cost of trade. Commodity prices can potentially have a very powerful inflationary effect on the cost of goods. The United Nations says average food prices jumped about 28% last year to a 10-year high. In Italy, pasta risks becoming unaffordable. Britain has an energy price cap that does not live up to its name. The answer to soaring bills is not to raise interest rates and make families poorer. Instead, Britain should have a serious conversation about key commodities as a source of power and their absence as a strategic vulnerability; and heed the wisdom of the past to deal with crises of the present.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on high energy prices: buffer stocks can stabilise them | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/16/the-guardian-view-on-high-energy-prices-buffer-stocks-can-stabilise-them
1/17/2022,"Boris Johnson’s plan for salvaging his premiership has become increasingly clear: acknowledge a “culture” of drinking in Downing Street – but not that it stemmed from the top – and then change the subject, by announcing a slew of populist policies. Nadine Dorries’ announcement that the BBC licence fee will be frozen, then abolished, had been in the works for a while; but the timing was highly convenient, giving Tory right-wingers something to cheer as Johnson’s future hangs in the balance.  Other plans expected in the coming days, according to the Sunday Times, include sending in the military to help tackle cross-Channel migration; training schemes for universal credit claimants – whose benefit was recently cut by £20 a week – and the much-delayed “levelling up” white paper. The lifting of Covid restrictions on 26 January, if the Omicron wave continues to abate, would also give Johnson a platform to deploy his customary boosterism. The hope appears to be to convince the public – and Johnson’s own mutinous backbenchers – that he is ready to draw a line under all the scandal, and get on with government. What is unclear is whether Tory MPs are willing to give him the chance. Having spent the weekend hearing from constituents and grassroots members, they are unlikely to return to Westminster on Monday in a more forgiving mood. Former minister Tim Loughton became the latest MP to call for Johnson to resign this weekend, saying the prime minister had resorted to “obfuscation, prevarication and evasion” over partygate. He is one of six MPs who have publicly said they are unwilling to wait for Sue Gray’s investigation to be published and want Johnson to go, but many more are hanging their decision about his future on her findings. Gray is expected to censure senior officials for their role – including, presumably, Martin “bring your own booze” Reynolds. But where Johnson’s actions are concerned, she is expected to stick to setting out the facts as she understands them. It may be impossible for her to judge whether he really “believed implicitly” the 20 May garden party was a “work event”, for example – leaving the ultimate judgment about his culpability up to politicians to make. And the emergence of more gatherings for her to investigate is likely to delay the report beyond this week, extending a period ministers were already calling “purgatory”. The outlines of the prime minister’s likely response to Gray’s findings, however, were already evident from Conservative party chair Oliver Dowden’s broadcast round on Sunday morning. He said Johnson felt a “sincere sense of regret” over what had happened – and suggested the prime minister was now the man to clean up “the underlying culture” in No 10. Johnson’s colleagues will have to decide whether the public will think that a remotely plausible idea – or whether he is irrevocably tainted in voters’ minds by the drip, drip of stories about lockdown-busting social events. They won’t have been reassured by the latest Opinium poll for the Observer, which showed his popularity ratings lower than Theresa May’s. Tory MPs also fear that more revelations are to come as they steel themselves to hit the campaign trail for May’s local elections. In particular, new facts could yet emerge that destroy Johnson’s claim to have attended just a single party – and that accidentally. Meanwhile, the problem with his plans for a flurry of rightwing announcements to tempt true-blue backbenchers is that his main rivals, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, are if anything more rightwing – but unburdened by the taint of scandal. And the backdrop for a new year relaunch is hardly auspicious, with a national insurance rise coming in April to coincide with rocketing energy bills for consumers. Johnson is a great political survivor, and some Conservative veterans were insisting this weekend he could still be in Downing Street by the autumn; but his escape route from the deep predicament he finds himself in now looks very narrow indeed.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson prepares a populist offensive to save his skin,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/16/boris-johnson-prepares-a-populist-offensive-to-save-his-skin
1/17/2022,"The US president, Joe Biden, suffered his worst day in office – so far – last Thursday. Mr Biden had begun that morning hoping to convince his party to support his push to change Senate rules to pass two voting rights bills. Even before he got a chance to make his case, Senator Kyrsten Sinema, a rightwing Democrat, rejected the president’s plan. At a stroke, two key parts of Mr Biden’s agenda – racial justice and democracy – appear stalled. On the same day, the US supreme court struck down the Biden administration’s requirement for businesses to make employees either be vaccinated against Covid-19 or test weekly and wear a mask at work. The president’s pledge to lift the threat of the pandemic won’t be redeemed any time soon. Mr Biden’s opponents paint him as a leader of drift and dwindling energy. If this view settles, then it’ll be ​​an image hard to shift. There’s little room for reassessment in politics. That is why the president must change course and have a clear-eyed view of his opponents within and without. The “moderate” wing of the Democratic party has already gutted the president’s climate plans. These Democrats, like most Republicans, depend on a donor class which wants to ​​render legislation inert that would hit corporate profits.  On the campaign trail Mr Biden said he would deal with the threat. In office he has not done so. The president faces a concerted campaign of leveraging money to protect money. Employers claimed that his “vaccine-or-test” mandate would cost billions of dollars to implement. A number of Republican-dominated states have fought its imposition. Covid-19 has killed almost a million Americans and hospitals are overwhelmed with unvaccinated patients. Conservative judges share an ideological aim with the Republican party to dismantle the system – at the cost of American lives during a pandemic – which permits the federal government to repeal unfair state laws. Mr Biden’s problem is that, on paper, the Democrats seem unassailable: controlling both houses of Congress and the presidency. But this is far from the case. Democrats were once something of a “party of state”. They controlled both the House and the Senate between 1933 and 1981, interrupted only by two brief Republican interludes. The Democrats won the presidency two-thirds of the time during this period. Today neither party perceives itself as a permanent majority or permanent minority. This helps to polarise politics as party differences cut against collaboration. Slim majorities now make radical change. Democrats demonstrated this with Obamacare. Republicans did the same with taxes in 2017. Bernie Sanders advises the Democrats to boil down their offer to its most popular elements and hold votes to extend child tax credits, cut drug prices and raise the federal hourly minimum wage to $15. This feels right and ought to appeal to Mr Biden: putting Democrats on the right side, and Republicans on the wrong side, of public opinion before November’s midterm elections. The stakes could not be higher. Maureen Dowd in the New York Times warned: “Joe Biden better Build Better or he won’t be Back”. That might open the door to Donald Trump – or someone worse.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view of Joe Biden: he needs to face opponents within – and without,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/16/the-guardian-view-of-joe-biden-he-needs-to-face-opponents-within-and-without
