1/10/2022,"James Mtume, the jazz and funk musician who fronted the group Mtume and produced a number of US chart hits for other artists, has died aged 75. His family confirmed the news to music website Pitchfork. Lisa Lucas, the daughter of one of Mtume’s collaborators, said: “So much loss. So much grief. Rest in power to Uncle Mtume.”  James Mtume was born James Forman in Philadelphia in 1946, and changed his name – Mtume means messenger in Swahili – after spending time with the black nationalist group US Organization in the mid to late 1960s, while studying in Pasadena in California. A pianist and percussionist since his teens, Mtume was soon drawn into the orbit of major mid-century jazz players, beginning with his uncle Albert “Tootie” Heath’s album Kawaida in 1969, which featured Mtume compositions played by a group including Herbie Hancock, Don Cherry and Mtume’s father Jimmy Heath. Mtume moved to New York, and played alongside Miles Davis for his funk fusion album On the Corner and a number of other early 1970s recordings such as Dark Magus; further sessions in these years came with Lonnie Liston Smith, Gato Barbieri, McCoy Tyner and more. Joining forces with another member of Davis’s electric-era band, guitarist Reggie Lucas, the pair toured with Roberta Flack and formed their own group, Mtume, securing a major label deal in 1978. With James Mtume playing keys and percussion, and singing alongside vocalist Tawatha Agee, the group recorded two albums of joyous, driving funk before their best known record, Juicy Fruit (1983). Its title track topped the R&B chart and crossed over into the Top 50 of the pop charts, and its beat and vocal later formed the backing for the Notorious BIG’s Juicy. Mtume and Lucas also became a production and songwriting duo, creating hits for Stephanie Mills, whose sweeping disco song Never Knew Love Like This Before reached No 6 in the US in 1980 and won a Grammy for best R&B performance; and Flack and Donny Hathaway’s ballad duet The Closer I Get to You (later covered by Beyoncé and Luther Vandross) which reached No 2. They had a minor hit with another duet, Two Hearts by Mills and Teddy Pendergrass. Mtume continued to work as a producer, earning credits on albums by Mary J Blige, R Kelly and K-Ci & JoJo, and was also a DJ for New York station Kiss. Mills was among those paying tribute, saying: “He was so brilliant and an amazing music mind. The work chemistry we had was second to none. I will continue to lift you up through our music.” DJ Premier described Mtume as an icon, saying: “Thx for your incredible contributions to music.”",Arts/Music,"James Mtume, jazz and funk musician, dies aged 75",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/10/james-mtume-jazz-and-funk-musician-dies-aged-75
1/10/2022,"China is battling to stamp out its first outbreak of the Omicron variant, just weeks before the Chinese new year and the Beijing Winter Olympics, with cases recorded in at least two distant provinces. On Monday health authorities reported 97 new locally transmitted cases for the preceding 24 hours, across several cities. At least 30 cases were in Henan province, while 21 new cases were reported in the Tianjin district of Jinnan, including 15 children aged five to 15.  At least two of the cases detected in Jinnan were reported as Omicron, the latest variant of Covid-19, which is many times more transmissible and is tearing through other countries around the world. In Anyang, Henan province, two Omicron cases were traced to a student who had arrived from Tianjin more than 300 miles (500km) away, officials said. There were 15 cases reported in Anyang for Monday but the breakdown of variant type was not disclosed. State media have described the outbreak as China’s “first real battle against Omicron”. In response Tianjin authorities have tightened controls on people’s movements, requiring residents to get approval from employers or community authorities in order to leave, and 75,680 have been quarantined, according to the Global Times. Subway lines have been closed and about 150 flights reportedly cancelled. Schools and university campuses have been closed. About 14 million residents of Tianjin districts have been asked to stay in place and report for testing. Those who don’t will have their health code changed on the widely-used app that controls quarantine, travel and other pandemic related movements. Some measures have been focused on preventing cases reaching the capital, Beijing, about 60 miles away, which is set to host the Winter Olympics next month. A party meeting including senior city officials reportedly urged rapid action and testing to create a “moat” around the city. Unnecessary travel between Tianjin and Beijing has been strongly discouraged, with those who can asked to work from home, and trains into Beijing from Tianjin have been cancelled. Road checkpoints have also been set up for vehicles entering Beijing. In Beijing temperature checks and QR codes have been strengthened, as well as controls and inspections at transportation hubs, schools and accommodations. The government has also warned people of punishment for concealing infections or failing to implement anti-pandemic measures adequately. “The spring festival is approaching, the flow of people will be more frequent, and the Beijing Winter Olympics and the Winter Paralympics will be held soon,” said a government notice on Monday. “The epidemic prevention and control cannot be relaxed for a moment.” China has been committed to a zero-Covid policy, and deploys extraordinary resources including mass testing of tens of millions, targeted and blanket lockdowns, and travel restrictions, often at a moment’s notice and sometimes over just a handful of cases. Pressure has grown on authorities with the Winter Olympics around the corner, and some local officials have been punished for alleged inaction, leading to increasingly harsh responses. The policy – and people’s support for it – has been challenged by the subsequent responses to recent outbreaks, including in Xi’an where 13 million people have spent more than two weeks in lockdown with reported instances of food shortages and delays in accessing medical care, and another 2 million locked down in Yuzhou. The spring festival, when east Asia celebrates the lunar new year, is typically the biggest holiday of the year with hundreds of millions of people travelling across the region to see family. The past two years have been heavily affected by the pandemic and associated travel restrictions or lockdowns, with many migrant workers prevented from travelling home – often the only time of the year they get to do so. “I haven’t been back to my hometown for Chinese new year for three years,” said one online commentator, who nonetheless urged people to reduce travel again if they could. ‘“Chinese people have a strong family concept. Last year, they called on everyone to celebrate the new year locally. Many people were late for the reunion for a year, which would inevitably lead to a collective impulse. It may be difficult to call on people to celebrate locally this year.” Additional reporting by Xiaoqian Zhu",News/World news,China battles Omicron outbreak weeks before Winter Olympics,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/china-battles-omicron-outbreak-weeks-before-winter-olympics
1/10/2022,"Manchester City cannot be held responsible for the abuse suffered by eight men at the hands of the paedophile Barry Bennell more than 30 years ago, a high court judge has ruled. The claimants, now in their 40s and 50s, say Bennell, now 68, abused them when they were playing schoolboy football for teams he coached in north-west England between 1979 and 1985.  Bennell was a scout for City during that time and the eight men argued the relationship between Bennell and City was “one of employment or one akin to employment”. The men had argued that City were vicariously liable for the abuse. City bosses denied that claim, saying Bennell was a local City scout in the mid-1970s but not between 1979 and 1985. Bennell, who is in jail after being convicted on five separate occasions of child sex offences against 22 boys, also denied being linked to Manchester City during the 1980s but told the judge he had “always used and exploited” his previous connections with City for his “own benefit”.",Sport/Football,"Manchester City cannot be held responsible for Barry Bennell abuse, court rules",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/10/manchester-city-cannot-be-held-responsible-for-barry-bennell-abuse-court-rules
1/10/2022,"At times, this slow-burn indie hillbilly thriller feels like a heavy-footed stomp through the genre. It’s set in the Appalachian mountains, where a close-knit clannish community lives by its own rules; a lawless backcountry in which a lone woman takes on the meanest family on the mountain to protect her own, banjos strumming on the score. It’s not exactly strong on originality or authenticity. But what The Devil to Pay does have going for it is a performance of real emotional force by Danielle Deadwyler (best known for supporting roles in films such as the Netflix western The Harder They Fall).  Deadwyler plays Lemon Cassidy, a farmer eking out a living with her husband and little boy. Life is tough, and gets tougher still when Lemon’s husband goes missing while up to his neck in trouble with the Runions – a terrifying local family headed up by matriarch Tommy (Catherine Dyer). We meet Tommy in her kitchen, all apple-pie sweetness and giving baking tips in the same breath as she threatens to kill Lemon’s son. As a character she’s a shade too gimmicky, or perhaps Dyer goes a bit light on the menace; either way Ma Runion never feels genuinely scary. Still, Lemon appears convincingly scared, eyes saucer-wide with terror. And she stays frightened while on her quest to find her husband and clear his debt. Usually, it seems a stretch when ordinary people turning badass in movies, instantly acquiring ice-cold killer instincts and a deadly aim. But Lemon trembles as she points her gun; in every scene she looks afraid for her life. Deadwyler’s soulful performance really grounds The Devil to Pay even as it cranks into revenge-movie mode. That said, if you want a slice of grim Americana to hunker down with, I’d go with Winter’s Bone or Frozen River.  The Devil to Pay is released on 17 January on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,The Devil to Pay review – revenge is a dish served tepid in hillbilly thriller,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/10/the-devil-to-pay-review-revenge-is-a-dish-served-tepid-in-hillbilly-thriller
1/10/2022,"In February 2019, Anna, a finance professional in her 50s, joined the dating website Zoosk. She had been single for four years, recovering from an incredibly difficult, abusive marriage. “I was finally ready to meet someone,” she says. So, when she met Andrew, a handsome Bulgarian food importer living in London, she was thrilled. The pair were soon spending hours talking on the phone each day. Anna was smitten. “He showered me with love and affection,” she says. “If you imagine candy floss, I was the stick and he was the sugar wrapped around me. I felt as though I was floating.”  They made plans to meet up, but Andrew told her he had to go to France for an urgent business trip. They continued to speak on the phone and also, occasionally, on video chat. About five weeks after they first made contact, Andrew asked to borrow money; just a small amount. “He told me he’d had a work crisis and needed help with port charges for a delivery. He was so distressed by the unexpected charge. I felt sorry for him.” Anna thought Andrew was her perfect man. Now, she believes he was a character invented by a criminal gang to extort her. So-called “romance fraud” – where unsuspecting victims are scammed by someone with whom they have formed a relationship – is nothing new. But online dating makes such fraud easier; experts saythese scams have increased in sophistication and frequency. Then came the pandemic – when online dating was the only kind that was allowed. According to Action Fraud, the UK’s reporting centre for fraud and cybercrime, 8,863 cases were reported to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) between November 2020 and October 2021, up from 6,968 the previous year, with total losses for the past year amounting to almost £92m. Daters who started online relationships between Christmas and Valentine’s Day were the most susceptible, with 901 reports recorded in March 2021. These figures are likely to be the tip of the iceberg – Action Fraud says the shame and stigma around romance fraud mean many people don’t report it. Things soon got worse for Anna – Andrew’s requests began to snowball. He told her his daughter was unwell, then that she had died and that he desperately needed money for repatriation and funeral costs. Anna checked the charges were legitimate, before sending money directly to a funeral services company in France. Whenever she became suspicious, Andrew assuaged her fears. “I’d be sucked back into his all-powerful love bubble. I was also getting receipts for many things and he constantly had an explanation for me.” The following year, Andrew had more unpaid charges on his shipping containers. Then, in March 2021, everything got more serious – he told her he had been taken hostage by loan sharks and was being tortured. “I was absolutely distraught. He said he was being stripped and beaten, and sent me pictures of his broken arm. He was locked in a room with no windows.” In the summer of 2021, when Andrew claimed he was still being held hostage, Anna asked a French Facebook group if anyone had seen him. One reply astonished her. “A woman contacted me and told me the man I’d posted a picture of was Juan Soler, an Argentinian-Mexican actor. She tried to explain I’d been scammed, but I couldn’t believe it.” Anna confronted Andrew, but he said he could explain and “made me question how I could doubt him”. Anna’s new Facebook friend, meanwhile, spent months trying to convince Anna to call Action Fraud. “I pointed out that we’d had video calls, but she told me he’d been using technology to superimpose a moving image.” Despite the mounting evidence against Andrew, Anna didn’t want to be responsible for his death at the hands of loan sharks if he was telling the truth. By the time she had been convinced to sever ties with him, in October this year, she had lost £350,000. “I had spent the year completely unstable, trapped in this abusive cycle. I’d become obsessed with preventing his pain.” After ending the relationship, she cried for weeks. “It felt like losing a husband that I loved with every inch of my heart and soul. I was never going to get any closure or say goodbye.” Anna has now reported Andrew to Action Fraud; the situation is under investigation. Olivia James, a trauma therapist, explains why romance fraud is uniquely seductive. “Many of us have wounds around our age, appearance and past relationships that make us susceptible to someone promising love. It’s tempting to ignore doubts and see what we want to see,” she says. This cognitive process is known as “betrayal blindness”. “Sometimes people have an inkling, but the fear of abandonment is too much.” It is not uncommon for people to ignore signs of cheating or accept crumbs of affection in place of real commitment. “Romance fraud is just a more extreme version of something that lots of us have experienced,” says James. “For some people, there’s an element of rescue fantasy, too. If they can help this person, they’ll be able to live out their happily-ever-after romance.” It is a particularly cruel crime, says James. The hurt it causes, alongside the loss of financial stability, can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder and other long-term mental health conditions. “People feel completely destabilised. They stop trusting themselves or anyone else. As humans, we need connections with others, so being betrayed by someone you thought was your soulmate is incredibly hard.” The love-bombing tactic used by such scammers can be hard to resist. “These online romances can make people feel as if they have found a knight or woman in shining armour, because they’re getting showered with affection they may not have previously received,” she says. “But this form of attention can be a form of emotional abuse used to control people.” Societal pressure to find “the One” increases victims’ susceptibility, too. “Not having found that can make people feel like a failure and leaves them even more vulnerable to betrayal.” Samantha Cooper, who runs Rogue Daters, an investigation company specialising in romance fraud, agrees it is becoming increasingly common. “The most targeted age groups seem to be people over the age of 45 – especially women. By this age, they may own a house or a successful business, or have received an inheritance.” As with Anna, many of Cooper’s clients struggle to accept that their partner isn’t who they thought they were – even after being presented with evidence. “Scammers are manipulative and use grooming techniques,” she says. “Once a person has been scammed, in most cases it is impossible to get the money sent back, so our biggest challenge is preventing this from happening in the first place.” Such deceptions can continue offline. Carol Goodall, 62, met her former partner Gary on a dating website at the end of 2015. “I was working long hours as a carer and it was nice to be able to talk to someone. I’d had a difficult marriage that had ended nine years earlier and I was very lonely.” Gary seemed like a wonderful man. The relationship moved quickly; by April 2016, he had asked Goodall to marry him. Although she worried it was a bit fast, friends encouraged her to take the plunge. “Everything was so great. I’d been honest about my experiences with my ex and he was the opposite – always kind and thoughtful.” But a few days before they were due to marry, in September 2016, he told her there was a problem with his divorce papers and that they had to delay the wedding. “All his excuses sounded plausible,” says Goodall. “Looking back, he always showed me papers when I was busy cooking or cleaning, then pulled them away.” By November, Gary suggested having a blessing while they waited for the official paperwork. He also suggested that Goodall sell her three-bedroom house so they could pool their resources to buy a bigger place. “He adored my kids and told me he wanted what was best for them.” Due to Goodall’s long hours, Gary handled the house sale and told her that he had transferred the money into a joint account. While they looked for their own place, they rented a home. But soon Gary was disappearing in the evenings and at weekends. When Goodall raised concerns, Gary reassured her that he loved her and would do anything for her. In a last-ditch attempt to distract and manipulate her, he claimed he had cancer. “It was devastating. I’d lost my mum to the disease and he knew how much it had hurt me.” One day in 2018, Goodall was contacted by another woman: “She was also engaged to Gary. He’d sold her house, too, and she had never seen the money.” Goodall learned that Gary’s real name was Richard Robinson – and that he was known to the police as a conman. “I feel like I’ve been incredibly stupid, but he was so convincing. I am heartbroken and unable to trust my own judgment. My confidence has been shattered. I’m still lonely, but I don’t know how I’ll ever be able to trust anyone again,” she says. Robinson was sentenced to 10 years in jail in 2020 for defrauding two women, but Goodall was not able to recover the £250,000 she lost. She has moved to a one-bedroom flat and has little money left for food or furniture. “As much as I want to forget it, I can’t. I struggle to get out of bed, to go to work, and there have been many times I wanted to end my life. I can’t understand how this has happened to me.” Lisa Mills is a senior fraud manager at Victim Support, which offers guidance for people affected by scams. She says that romance fraud makes up about one-fifth of the cases in her area of Sussex, mostly targeted through online dating platforms or social media. “A lot of dating websites are trying to clamp down on fake profiles, so criminals are changing tactics and using other platforms, like Facebook. They trawl through profiles to build up a profile of themselves that a victim might be interested in,” she says. “We advise people to privatise all their settings, as people with lots of information online can be more easily duped – scammers can create a more ‘suitable’ partner for them to trust.” Although it might not seem romantic, she also suggests people do some research when they meet someone new. “You can use Google to do a reverse image search and check the person’s name,” she says. “Look out for red flags. Anyone who can’t meet up, is constantly away or can’t phone or video call properly is potentially a scammer.” Keith Grinsted, 69, says loneliness is the root cause of this growing problem. As well as being targeted himself, Grinsted knows of other victims through his online support group, Goodbye Lonely, which he set up in 2020. “I was very low, and there’s an element of desperation when you’re single,” he says. “I started online dating so I didn’t have to go through another lockdown alone.” Because he was so eager to meet someone, he gave potential partners the benefit of the doubt, even when he spotted red flags. Last year, he began speaking to Tina, whom he hoped to meet when restrictions lifted. After many weeks of chatting to Grinsted, she told him she was living in poverty. “She started sending pictures of empty food bowls, so I sent over some money for food,” he says. But when she asked for more money to pay for flights back from the US to meet him, alarm bells began to ring. “She claimed to be visiting sick relatives, but I couldn’t understand how she’d flown there in lockdown,” he says. Instead of giving her money, he offered to book her flight home. She disappeared without a trace. The emotional impact was huge. “I thought I’d found someone wonderful, and we’d spoken about potentially living together,” he says. “When it all fell apart, I deliberately kept myself awake – I didn’t want the next day to arrive and to feel even worse. It took a long time to recover.” He has been targeted since then, but has become more attuned to the warning signs. According to Dan Parkinson from City of London police, reports of romance fraud have been rising since 2017. “Criminals are likely to have been exploiting the inability of victims to gain timely support and advice from others,” he says. “Remember: never give money to someone you haven’t met, no matter how well you think you know them. If you feel uncomfortable or unsure, speak to trusted friends and family members and get their advice.” Mills says many people feel ashamed that others will judge them for falling for such scams. “Victim-blaming is a particular problem, because on the face of it someone has given their money away. But if people knew the inner workings of the scams – the manipulative techniques and an individual’s personal situation – they might feel differently.” Such judgment means many victims turn to charities such as Victim Support, or peer support groups such as the Society of Citizens Against Relationship Scams, rather than loved ones. Anna is one. “I know they’d tell me I was insane, but it’s impossible to explain how all‑consuming and addictive this love for Andrew was,” she says. She is determined to ensure others avoid the same trap. “I am intelligent, but I’m not the only person this has happened to. The heart and mind can be fragile, especially after abuse. The combination of taking someone’s heart while robbing them day in, day out exceeds evil.” Some names have been changed.

1/10/2022,"A Little Catechism from the Demon What is a demon? Study my life.What is a mountain? Set out now.What is fire? It is for ever.What is my life? A fall, a call.What is the deep? Set out now.What is thunder? Your power dry.What is the film? It rolls, it tells.What is the film? Under the Falls.Where is the theatre? Under the hill.Where is the demon? Walking the hills.Where is the victory? On the high tops.Where is the fire? Far in the deep.Where is the deep? Study the demon.Where is the mountain? Set out now.Study my life and set out now.  From the first line of this intriguing, unsettling “catechism”, we can reasonably infer that the demon is the speaker, uttering both the questions and the pedagogically correct responses. So the first question for us is the one that begins the poem (“What is a demon?”) and is dodged. We have only a series of selective questions and oblique responses from which to build a picture. At least we know it’s a teacher demon: it wants to be understood, to spread demonic knowledge and be an exemplar for the student demons. The voice sounds robotic: perhaps this is a post-human AI demon, programmed for re-mastery of a near-devastated planet. Non sequiturs sometimes suggest it’s still in the process of mastering the English language. It’s certainly not big on clear explanation. But perhaps this make it all the more attractive to the students it’s addressing. Much of the imagery is drawn from the natural world, and the symbolism of these images is clear. The demon seems to favour mountains, hill-tops and “the deep”: it’s possibly a fire-worshipper. There is a question as to whether there’s a gap between its ambition and its actual power. The response in the sixth line (“What is thunder? Your power dry”) is elusive: has the power become dangerously less by being “dry” – or more potent? The demon might itself be identified with Satan (see line four). It could equally be a benign daemon, or simply a neutral force of nature. It’s fascinated, though, by two non-demonic human inventions – theatre and film. These media have perhaps seduced it to a further desire for “victory” and the means for achieving it. Film, after all, has the power to tell its story. The 15-line catechism is in two sonnet-like parts, the first eight questions beginning with “What” and the following six with “Where?” This suggests a movement outwards from theory to the experience of the phenomena invoked. If the demon has a message, it’s that knowledge is achieved by action: studying the life, and then setting out now. Questions breed questions and the skilful avoidance of direct answers increases the thrill of interest. Edwin Morgan’s experimental and science fiction poems often imply joyful adventure, boundless optimism. This set of coolly mysterious imperatives leaves us wondering about the nature of the quest, so urgently and indeterminately presented. That repeated call to “set out” somehow implies that human history, even after catastrophe, will start up and continue as before, meeting the challenges of its newly elemental setting. We’ll still want mastery. We’ll still rush to “set out now”. And perhaps Edwin Morgan, in his wisdom, is saying that this is the only right thing to do. The demonic is the human.

1/10/2022,"Rising temperatures due to the climate crisis will lead to a rise in people suffering from kidney stones – a painful medical condition exacerbated by heat and dehydration, according to a new study.  Researchers used two climate scenarios to estimate the burden of heat and humidity related kidney stone disease by the end of the century in South Carolina – a state in the south-east US, a region which currently has a higher than average incidence rate. In the US, about one in 10 people suffers from kidney stones at some point, and the incidence increases from north to south. According to researchers at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (Chop), the number of cases will increase between 2.2% and 3.9% depending on whether greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate or are cut to an intermediate level, leading to a huge rise in health costs either way. Kidney stones are caused by hard deposits of minerals (mostly calcium) that develop in concentrated urine which are extremely painful when passing through the urinary tract. The incidence of the condition has escalated over the past two decades, particularly among people of color, women and adolescents. Diet and lifestyle changes have contributed to the rise in the condition, but prior research has demonstrated that high ambient temperatures increase the risk. The number of people seeking medical help for kidney stones escalates following very hot days when the risk of dehydration multiplies. “With climate change, we don’t often talk about the impact on human health, particularly when it comes to children, but a warming planet will have significant effects on human health,” said Gregory Tasian, a pediatric urologist at Chop and senior author of the study published in Scientific Reports. In the first scenario modeled, the average temperature would increase by 2.3C by 2100, compared with 3.6C in the second. Results from a wide range of climate model studies suggest average temperature could be 1.1C to 5.4C warmer by the end of the century.",News/Environment,"Global heating could lead to an increase in kidney stone disease, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/10/global-heating-increase-kidney-stone
1/10/2022,"Michael Gove has said leaseholders will not have to pay large sums to remedy fire defects in blocks of flats that go beyond cladding, after campaigners said a £4bn package to try to ease the crisis might not go far enough. “My guiding principle is that leaseholders should not be held responsible for paying for work that was not their responsibility in the first place, and that it should be the owners of these buildings or those who were responsible for their construction that should pay,” the communities and levelling up secretary told BBC1’s Breakfast.  In a later interview with Radio 4’s Today programme – briefly delayed after he became trapped in a BBC lift – Gove was asked about the plight of people facing bills not only for cladding but for potential fire risks such as wooden balconies and missing fire doors. “They won’t be expected to pay the bill,” Gove said. “We need to be able to allow people to get on with their lives, confident that they are in buildings that are safe, confident that they are in flats that they can sell. “And that’s why we need to ensure that those who are in a position to pay do so – that is the developers, in many cases the individuals who also own the freehold, the ultimate owners of the buildings.” Gove is to set out his plans to parliament later on Monday, when he will say that companies connected to the scandal over unsafe blocks of flats following the Grenfell Tower disaster in June 2017 will be expected to contribute more. Campaigners have said that while Gove’s plans “could be the beginning of the end” of the cladding crisis, the issue went beyond cladding, with leaseholders being presented with large bills for other defects. Gove told BBC Breakfast these issues needed to be looked at: “We are seeking to identify exactly which steps need to be taken building by building because again, I think it’s important that we take a proportionate approach. “We’ve got to make sure that buildings are safe but it’s also been the case that there’s been something of an industry of looking at some buildings which are sort of mid-rise, and assuming that work requires to be done there, which actually isn’t necessary in terms of safety, but that industry has made a profit out of saying we need this or that additional step to be required.” He told Today it would not be the case that some money would need to come from the central housing budget to cover the costs, saying that developers, freeholders and cladding companies were not willing to properly contribute, then the ultimate sanction would be to tax them. “Our backstop is that we want to make sure that if all our efforts at negotiation, conversation and constructive work don’t work, then what we can do is we can can increase taxation on those who are responsible,” he said. “If necessary we will use that blunt but heavy instrument in order to ensure we get the support we need for those who are on the frontline.”",News/UK news,"Leaseholders will not have to pay to fix any fire risks, vows Gove ",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/10/leaseholders-will-not-have-to-pay-to-fix-any-fire-risks-vows-gove
