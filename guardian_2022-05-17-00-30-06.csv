5/17/2022,"Two of Boris Johnson’s most reckless chickens are coming home to roost. To get hard Brexit into law and topple his predecessor, Theresa May, he told Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party that he would allow no border in the Irish Sea. He promptly allowed one, and signed a protocol to the Brexit deal to that effect. An enraged DUP is duly refusing to let the new Northern Irish executive take office until that border goes. Johnson is now threatening to unilaterally renege on the protocol, in turn enraging the EU by flagrantly breaching the withdrawal deal. Precisely this trap was built into hard Brexit from day one. Everyone knew it. It was classic Johnson. He lied his way out of each scrape, sacking or ennobling colleagues according to taste. The absence of a new executive in Belfast leaves open the prospect of direct rule from London. If Johnson fails to dismantle the EU-ordained border controls at Belfast docks, the DUP will stall power-sharing. If he gives in and allows the world’s goods to flow freely into the Irish republic, the EU has threatened to retaliate in an all-out trade war. The question is what new “constructive ambiguity” – a euphemism for fudge – Johnson can conceivably fashion to get him out of this mess. Amid all the shouting and screaming of Brexit, quiet voices were warning: don’t forget Northern Ireland. The Brexiters dismissed it as a historical trifle. Since the UK would have tariff-free trade with the EU, the Irish border would be “frictionless”. No problem. Of all the deceits of hard Brexit, none was more blatant than the word frictionless. Johnson in effect ceded authority over the 40% of Britain’s trade that is with the EU under the pretence that he was “taking back control”. But it takes two to trade. Hundred-page forms and hours-long queues at Dover have been the result, with similar friction at the Belfast border. The M&S chairman, Archie Norman, protested last week that a staggering 700 pages of forms is required to get two trucks across the Irish Sea from England, requiring eight hours of work by 20 staff. The reality is that any border is a border, offering any number of impediments to trade. The EU was furious at hard Brexit. What on earth made Johnson think it would make his life easy? The prime minister’s first decision must be to call the bluff of the DUP’s intransigent leader, Jeffrey Donaldson. Stony-faced unionists have been the bane of British prime ministers back to Lloyd George. In 1921, the territory was gerrymandered to deliver a perpetual unionist majority, and the resulting one-party rule has caused Britain little but trouble. At this month’s local elections, that historic act of gerrymandering failed. An exhausted electorate split the unionist vote three ways; Sinn Féin has emerged in poll position. It could one day lead Northern Ireland, with care, towards eventual reunion with the south. Donaldson faces an existential threat and has nothing to lose. The Good Friday agreement of 1998 achieved peace by embedding power-sharing between the nationalist and unionist constituencies. With each side having a veto, it has constantly broken down and cannot survive formally without the leading unionist bloc, the DUP, in play. At the same time, Northern Ireland’s government is reportedly a shambles. In particular, its health service is delivering some of the worst outcomes of any part of the UK: just last week it was reported that the number of people waiting for more than 12 hours in A&E had doubled in a year. Somehow the logjam must be cleared. Johnson has to demand that Donaldson return to Stormont or that Northern Ireland must be ruled without him. Until power-sharing returns, with first minister designate Michelle O’Neill in post, London must find a mechanism for re-establishing the executive, with a role for O’Neill. This might involve some sort of “ghost” executive under the formal aegis of the Northern Ireland secretary. The reality is that democracy in Northern Ireland is starting to change, and in a welcome and more open direction. London has ruled its Irish territory abominably for over a century. It owes it help towards a new dawn. The short-term question remains whether Johnson can say anything to the unionists sufficient to entice them back. For most in Northern Ireland, the border is not the chief political issue. It has been replaced by the cost of living and the state of the health service. By the same token, it is clearly worth attempting yet again to plead with Brussels’ better nature to find some partial compromise on the border question. The present controls are indefensible. Hard Brexit was a mistake, a crude and casual gesture by Johnson to prop up his leadership bid. He showed no sign of knowing what “hard” might entail. But then there were few remainers ready to support “soft” Brexit as a halfway house. As it is, Brussels negotiators have clearly been instructed to play tough, subjecting British trade to a nightmare of barriers and bureaucracy. These are palpably beyond anything needed to protect standards, health and safety. At the same time, there is no reason for Britain not to accede to standards that it has shared with the rest of the continent for half a century. The proposals reputedly offered by the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, to ease the Belfast border are reasonable but inoperable, in the absence of the EU’s agreement. They embrace licensed “trusted traders”, and red and green lanes for vehicles intended to go on to Ireland and those remaining in Northern Ireland. A modicum of supervision should be able to protect the EU from global trade contamination. There is no need to chase trawlers across the high seas or follow British number plates through the lanes of Louth and Donegal. Surely there is compromise somewhere here. Europe has enough on its hands without the distraction of a childish trade war with Britain. Yes, Britain is to blame. It chose to leave the EU, but the EU should respect that. In addition, Johnson personally interpreted Brexit as leaving Europe’s economic trade area, for which he had no mandate. That decision is costing Britain dear and one day will, I am sure, have to be corrected. For the moment Johnson owes it to Northern Ireland to free it from the mess into which hard Brexit has condemned it. In doing so he could yet set it on the road to political reconstruction. That at least would be a silver lining on the Brexit cloud.

5/17/2022,"After 10 months of fraught negotiations, Chile has finalised the draft of a new constitution that could replace the document drawn up during Gen Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship. María Elisa Quinteros, the president of the gender-equal, 154-member assembly will formally present the draft at a ceremony in the port city of Antofagasta on Monday afternoon. “This is an ecological and equal constitution with social rights at its very core,” she said in an interview. Among the long list of rights and freedoms the draft enshrines, the new constitution makes higher education free, ensures gender parity across government and makes the state responsible for preventing, adapting to and mitigating climate change. The constitution will be put to a referendum on 4 September in which all Chileans aged 18 or older must vote. Chile exploded into protest in 2019 and millions of people took to the streets decrying a host of entrenched inequalities. In response, political parties struck a compromise to move towards replacing the Pinochet-era constitution. Nearly 80% of voters chose to begin that journey in an October 2020 plebiscite, and seven months later leftists and independents stormed elections for a constitutional convention. “With every bill that passed, we have provided answers to the demands of the 2019 demonstrations, such as better healthcare, education and pensions,” Quinteros said. The new document will for the first time offer constitutional recognition to Chile’s Indigenous population. “Whether this constitution is rejected or approved [by the plebiscite], I believe that Chile’s Indigenous peoples have already won,” said Rosa Catrileo, who represents the Mapuche, the country’s largest Indigenous group. “We have made our demands visible on a national level, and so never again will we be excluded from the conversation,” she said. The new document even includes a clause for the compensated restitution of historically Indigenous lands. Among a host of other changes, it opts to eliminate the senate in favour of a single-chamber legislature, and paves the way for Chile’s deeply unpopular private water rights system to be replaced. Since July last year, the former congress building in Santiago has been the stage for a lengthy and often bitter public battle over Chile’s future. The process was designed around participation, with citizens able to endorse articles and debate legislation at assemblies the length of Chile. As the country confronted its past head-on, delegates have occasionally been hounded by the public, while a vociferous campaign to undermine the process has raged in the background. Although the Pinochet-era constitution was reformed significantly under the presidency of Ricardo Lagos in 2005, it retains the ideological fingerprints of Chile’s dictator. It omits certain key rights, such as the right to housing, and focuses on securing the legacy of the military regime as well as a market-led model for the provision of social services. With 499 articles, Chile’s new constitution would be the world’s longest, prompting some concern over the “maximalist” approach taken by the delegates. The convention has divided into three commissions: one to streamline and condense the document; another to plot the transition from one constitution to the next; and a third to write a preamble. However, the outlook is uncertain ahead of September’s plebiscite. Latest polling suggests that initial enthusiasm for reform has dissipated, with 46% saying they will reject the draft compared with 38% voting in its favour. “There’s a chance that we’ll replace an illegitimate, authoritarian constitution with a divisive and ill-defined one,” said Kenneth Bunker, the director of tresquintos.cl, a political analysis website. Chile’s progressive new president, Gabriel Boric, has endured a tough start to his presidency with plummeting approval ratings, but was quick to voice his support for the convention after winning December’s election. “It’s not wise to equate the success of the government with the success of a plebiscite,” said Bunker, who believes that a narrow mandate for the new document could prolong Chile’s political upheaval. If the draft is approved by a majority, it will be ratified as Chile’s new constitution. If it is rejected, the 1980 document will remain in force.",News/World news,Chile finalises new draft constitution to replace Pinochet-era document,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/chile-constitution-new-draft-pinochet
5/17/2022,"The good news for Arsenal before Monday’s match against Newcastle at St James’ Park is that the battle for fourth place – and the lucrative Big Cup spot that comes with it – is in their own hands. Of course, this being Arsenal, it could be argued that this also constitutes bad news, as the only team more likely to mess up this golden opportunity to return to European football’s top table currently sit two points ahead of them in that fourth place, having played one game more. Of course it could also be argued that if you absolutely need to beat a particular team to leapfrog your most hated rivals and go fourth prior to the final day of the season, you’d probably handpick opposition who have lost all of their past eight games against you by an aggregate score of 18-1, as Newcastle have. However, all but one of those drubbings were dished out to a version of Newcastle that no longer exists – an incarnation that was owned by a tyrant fabled for cynically using the club and its ground to promote the personal fiefdom from which he generated his billions. But with Mike Ashley gone and their Premier League safety secured, Newcastle’s players have nothing much to play for tonight … apart from the love of 50,000 newly enthused fans. While Arsenal won the corresponding fixture at the Emirates with a minimum of fuss, that came only a few weeks before Eddie Howe was given the thick end of £100m to help buy his way out of trouble in January. While swathes of Newcastle fans have reacted to the negativity that greeted their takeover by Saudi sportswashers by creating a “them against us” culture around St James’ Park, Mikel Arteta has denied claims he has fostered a similar bunker mentality in Arsenal’s dressing room ahead of their final two games. Despite largely biting his lip, the Gunners boss was quite clearly furious with the match officials following his team’s shellacking at the hands of Spurs last week and made his feelings abundantly clear by deliberating not making them abundantly clear for fear of incurring a six-month ban. “I have no complaint and I didn’t complain on Thursday,” he said. “I just said I could not give a clear assessment on what I thought about the game, and that’s it.” For Arteta, his players and Arsenal’s fans, the pressure is on and will remain just as intense even if they win tonight. Newcastle, by contrast, can relax and focus on thwarting the Big Cup ambitions of one of the Premier League’s traditional elite, something they’ll almost certainly be doing a lot more vociferously in seasons to come.

5/17/2022,"It did not take long for the tremors from Vladimir Putin’s tanks rolling into Ukraine to reach the British arts sector, long a beneficiary of Russian money. Institutions including the Tate and Royal Academy ended ties with Russian oligarchs and donors, including Petr Aven and Viktor Vekselberg But it appears the war has also led to questions about the role of Sir Leonard Blavatnik – listed by the Sunday Times as Britain’s richest man. While not on any sanctions list, the Ukrainian-born billionaire’s links to sanctioned Russian oligarchs were the focus of discussion among officials involved in a multimillion pound donation by him that helped ensure a trove of literary treasures were saved for the nation. Blavatnik’s gift last year – the largest given by an individual to the UK for a literary treasure – amounted to half of the £15m raised by a national libraries charity, which saved the collection known as the Honresfield Library from being sold abroad. It is being shared with major UK cultural institutions, including the British Library. However, correspondence released under the Freedom of Information Act shows that his Russian links were the subject of discussions at the National Library of Scotland (NLS) in the days after the invasion of Ukraine. “Do we know if the Blavatnik money has been paid for the Honresfield yet?” a senior official at the NLS wrote to the chief executive of the library, Amina Shah, on 28 February. The official, the NLS director of business support Anthony Gillespie, added: “Blavatnik is a longtime friend and business partner of Ukrainian-born Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, one of Russia’s richest men, who is close to Russian president Vladimir Putin and some other Russian-associated oligarchs being under western sanctions for support of totalitarian regimes and criminal activities.” The NLS has since responded that Gillespie’s query to Shah “was of a procedural nature regarding whether there was a risk to the sale going through during a time when sanctions were being considered by the UK and other governments”. There is no suggestion Blavatnik is actively being considered for sanction. Blavatnik’s name has become a near-omnipresent fixture at major British cultural sites as a result of his philanthropy. After he made a £50m donation towards the new extension at Tate Modern, it was renamed the Blavatnik Building in 2017. But his philanthropy has not gone without comment. Criticism has often followed his donations, especially when it involves institutions naming buildings after him. In 2017, a leading political academic quit the University of Oxford – which benefited from £75m to set up the Blavatnik school of government – after it emerged that the billionaire had donated $1m (£800,000) to Donald Trump’s inauguration committee. Two years earlier, a collection of critics issued an open letter about his donation to the university, urging it to “stop selling its reputation and prestige to Putin’s associates”. At the time Blavatnik made it clear he was not an associate of Putin. Other correspondence released under FoI by the NLS gives a hint of the sensitivity attached to Blavatnik’s name. Heavily redacted emails between NLS officials discussing the press release around the library donation, and the subsequent press reporting, include one that states: “Love the phrasing ‘Known as the Blavatnik Honresfield Library (formerly Honresfield Library)’ as if they literally didn’t just name it that and are very clearly trying to keep the name of a republican-supporting Ukrainian oligarch out of the headlines.” While the name of the sender and recipient of the email was redacted, the apparently sarcastic comment was made in the context of NLS officials internally discussing a press release announcing the raising of money to save the Honresfield Library. Other correspondence reflected an eagerness on the part of the Friends of the National Libraries (FNL) that any written references refer to the Honresfield Library as the “Blavatnik Honresfield Library”. ​Those involved in the Blavatnik donation​ pointed out that he was a US and UK citizen, that it was made by his US charitable foundation and was given to the FNL at the beginning of November 2021, months before Russia invaded Ukraine. A spokesperson for Blavatnik, who was knighted in 2017, said his relationship with Vekselberg is limited to an indirect minority interest in a company in which Vekselberg also holds an interest. They added: “Sir Leonard has been actively trying to dispose of his interest for over three years while acting under explicit authorisation granted by the US Treasury department. For clarity, Sir Leonard’s personal and commercial activities are not, and have never been, involved with Putin, Russian politics, or the Russian government. “Sir Leonard and the Blavatnik Family Foundation believe that what is happening in Ukraine is heartbreaking and he condemns the ongoing violence. Along with all fellow American and British citizens, Sir Leonard hopes and prays that the conflict ends quickly and that peace returns to Ukraine.” In the meantime, the Blavatnik Family Foundation has donated millions of dollars to a range of charitable organisations working to assist Ukrainian refugees.",Arts/Culture,Questions raised about UK arts donations of Leonard Blavatnik,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/16/questions-raised-about-uk-arts-donations-of-leonard-blavatnik
5/17/2022,"All of the senior police managers giving evidence to a public inquiry have maintained they did not know that the undercover officers they were supervising had formed sexual relationships with women during their covert deployments. The inquiry, which is scrutinising the covert infiltration of political groups, has heard that the practice of undercover officers deceiving women into relationships was “endemic and common”. The current round of hearings has heard that two of the undercover officers who had relationships with women have been described by their colleagues respectively as a sexual predator and a carnivore. One undercover officer, Graham Coates, has previously said members of his unit made “gross and offensive” jokes about the women in the presence of managers who deliberately turned a blind eye. The inquiry, headed by the retired judge Sir John Mitting, is examining the conduct of undercover officers who spied on more than 1,000 mainly leftwing political groups between 1968 and at least 2010. The officers were given fake identities and spied on political activists in deployments that usually lasted four years. A key issue under review is how the officers had intimate relationships, often lasting years, with women during these covert operations. In public hearings lasting two weeks, the inquiry is looking at covert operations that took place between 1968 and 1982. During that period, at least seven undercover officers had, or are alleged to have had, sexual relationships with women who did not know their real identities. Thirteen managers who oversaw the operations during that time are giving evidence to this phase of the inquiry. David Barr, the inquiry’s QC, has said :“None of the witnesses states that he was aware of any sexual activity between contemporary SDS [Special Demonstration Squad] undercover officers and people whom they met undercover.” He has previously said that from the mid-1970s onwards, sexual contact between the undercover officers and the public was “not uncommon”. One undercover officer, Jim Pickford, infiltrated anarchist groups between 1974 and 1976. Pickford was a member of the undercover unit, the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS), which spied on political activists for four decades. The inquiry has heard that Pickford’s deployment was terminated after he admitted to his superiors that he had “fallen in love” with an activist. He later went on to have a child with the woman, although the details are opaque. Geoffrey Craft and Angus McIntosh, two managers who were in charge of the SDS at the time of Pickford’s deployment, have said they were unaware of his apparent admission. McIntosh said that had it happened, it would have given rise to serious welfare and operational difficulties. An unidentified SDS undercover officer has labelled Pickford a “sexual predator”. Craft said he was unaware of any sexual relationships involving undercover officers, adding :”It was assumed that nobody would be so stupid as to risk their careers by doing it”. He said that any relationship “would have placed him, his family and his future vetting in jeopardy”. Two undercover officers each had sexual relationships with four women, the inquiry has heard. One of them, Richard Clark, who infiltrated leftwing groups between 1974 and 1976, has been described as a “carnivore” by an unnamed SDS officer. Phillippa Kaufmann, a QC representing 21 women, told the inquiry last year that the practice of undercover officers deceiving women into relationships was “endemic”. The inquiry continues.",News/UK news,Police chiefs ‘unaware of undercover officers’ sexual relationships with women’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/spy-cops-police-chiefs-say-they-were-unaware-of-undercover-officers-sexual-relationships-with-women
5/17/2022,"An 18-year-old white man opened fire at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket on Saturday, killing 10 people and wounding three others in what authorities have described as a “hate crime and racially motivated violent extremism”. Eleven of the 13 victims were Black, and two were white. Authorities said that the shooter, who is white, drove to Tops Friendly Market at about 2.30pm, “allegedly wearing tactical gear and armed with an assault weapon”. When the shooter arrived, he shot four people outside the grocery, three of whom died, local prosecutors said. He then entered the supermarket, where a security guard, who had recently retired from the Buffalo police department, tried to stop him. The guard died in the exchange, and the shooter shot eight additional people inside the store, six of whom died, authorities said. The attacker was arraigned on a first-degree murder charge hours later, authorities said. Here is what we know about the victims so far. Salter, a retired Buffalo police lieutenant, was working as a security guard at Tops on Saturday when the shooter entered the grocery. Salter shot at the shooter in an effort to stop him, but was fatally wounded, according to WHIO TV. “One of the individuals inside the store is a security guard, a beloved security guard, who is a retired Buffalo police officer – a hero in our eyes. He engaged the suspect and fired multiple shots,” Buffalo’s police commissioner, Joseph Gramaglia, reportedly said at a press conference. Salter was 55, WHIO said. The 86-year-old had just visited her husband at his nursing home when she decided to pick up food at Tops, WGRZ reported. Whitfield is the mother of Buffalo’s former fire commissioner, Garnell Whitfield. “She was a religious woman who cared deeply for her family,” her daughter-in-law, Cassietta Whitfield, told the New York Times. “She’ll be truly missed.” Ruth Whitfield, a mother of four and grandmother of eight, called Buffalo home for more than 50 years. Cassietta Whitfield described her as a devout parishioner of the Durham Memorial AME Zion church. Ruth Whitfield sang in the choir, the Times reported. The Buffalo News identified one of the victims as Katherine Massey, reporting that a family member confirmed her death. She went to Tops to buy groceries, the newspaper reported. Massey’s sister, Barbara Massey, said in a text to a reporter: “She was a beautiful soul.” Betty Jean Grant, a former Erie county legislator, said that Massey, 72, was a civil rights and education advocate. Less than one year ago, Massey wrote a letter to the newspaper calling for more federal gun regulations. “There needs to be extensive federal action/legislation to address all aspects of the issue,” Massey wrote. “Current pursued remedies mainly inspired by mass killings – namely, universal background checks and banning assault weapons – essentially exclude the sources of our city’s gun problems. Illegal handguns, via out of state gun trafficking, are the primary culprits.” The New York Times reported that Roberta Drury, 32, was among those killed at the Tops supermarket. Amanda Drury, her sister, told the newspaper that she was going to the store to buy supplies for dinner. “She was very vibrant,” Amanda Drury reportedly said. “She always was the center of attention and made the whole room smile and laugh.” For 25 years, 77-year-old Pearly Young ran a food pantry in Buffalo’s Central Park neighborhood, WGRZ reported. The shooter killed Young as she was shopping for groceries. Young, who fed the needy every Saturday, was a “mother, grandmother, and missionary”, the news station said. Patterson routinely gave people rides to the supermarket, and assisted them in carrying their groceries, the New York Times said. His great niece, Teniqua Clark, confirmed to the newspaper that he was fatally shot. The family of Celestine Chaney has identified her as one of the 10 people killed, according to the New York Times. Chaney’s son, Wayne Jones, told the newspaper that his mother was visiting her sister. Chaney wanted strawberry shortcake, so they went to Tops for the ingredients. “She loved those,” he said. Chaney’s sister got to the freezer, “but my mom cannot really walk like she used to”, Jones reportedly said. “She basically can’t run.” Geraldine Talley, 62, had come to shop with her fiance, according to ABC News. Talley was one of nine siblings and was “an amazing sister, mother, aunt”, her sister Kaye Chapman-Johnson told the TV network. “She just was truly an amazing woman. And I’m going to miss her dearly.” Her fiance survived the shooting after he went to shop in a different part of the store when the attack began. Andre Mackneil was 53 years old and from the central New York city of Auburn. No others details have yet been made available. Margus Morrison, 52, was a father of three from Buffalo, the mother of his children confirmed to TV station 7 News. No other details were immediately available.

5/17/2022,"From carbon to uranium, oxygen to iron, chemical elements are the building blocks of the world around us and the wider universe. Now, physicists are hoping to gain an unprecedented glimpse into their origins, with the opening of a new facility that will create thousands of peculiar and unstable versions of atoms never before recorded on Earth. By studying these versions, known as isotopes, they hope to gain new insights into the reactions that created the elements within exploding stars, as well as testing theories about the “strong force” – one of the four fundamental forces in nature, which binds protons and neutrons together in an atom’s nucleus. The facility could also yield new isotopes for medical use. Atoms are composed of protons, neutrons and electrons. The number of protons dictates an atom’s chemical behaviour and which element it is – eg carbon always has six protons, and gold 79 – whereas atoms of the same element containing different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Because many isotopes are unstable and decay quickly – sometimes within fractions of a second – scientists have only studied a small proportion of those thought to exist. “There are 285 isotopes of elements that exist on Earth, but we think that there are potentially 10,000 isotopes for the elements up to uranium,” said Prof Bradley Sherrill, the scientific director of the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan State University, which officially opened on 2 May. “The goal of FRIB is to provide as wide of an access to this vast landscape of other isotopes as technology allows.” Some of these “rare isotopes” may drive reactions crucial to the formation of elements, so by studying them physicists hope to gain a better understanding of the chemical history of the universe – including how we got here. The vast majority of elements are thought to have been created within exploding stars, but “in many cases we don’t know which stars created which elements, because these reactions involve unstable isotopes – things we couldn’t readily get our hands on,” said Prof Gavin Lotay, a nuclear physicist at the University of Surrey, who plans to use the new facility to investigate common explosions called X-ray busts within neutron stars. Another goal is to understand atomic nuclei well enough to develop a comprehensive model of them, which could provide fresh insights into the role they play in the creation of energy for stars, or the reactions occurring within nuclear power plants. The facility could also yield medically useful isotopes. Already, doctors use radioactive isotopes in eg Pet scans and some types of radiotherapy, but the discovery of additional ones could help improve diagnostic imaging, or provide new ways of seeking out and destroying tumours. To generate these isotopes, FRIB will accelerate a beam of atomic nuclei to half the speed of light and send them shooting down a 450-metre pipe, before crashing them into a target that causes some of the atoms to fragment into smaller combinations of protons and neutrons. A series of magnets will then filter out the desired isotopes and direct them into experimental chambers for further study. “Within a millionth of a second, we can select a particular isotope and deliver it to an experiment where [scientists] may catch it and watch for its radioactive decay, or we may use it to induce another nuclear reaction and use those reaction products to tell us something about the structure of the isotope,” Sherrill said. The first experiments will involve making the heaviest possible isotopes of fluorine, aluminium, magnesium and neon, and comparing their rates of radioactive decay with those predicted by existing models. “The surprise will be if our observations agree with what we expected,” Sherrill said. “Most likely they won’t agree, and then we’ll use that disagreement to refine our models.” Approximately a month later, FRIB researchers plan to measure the radioactive decay of isotopes thought to exist within neutron stars – some of the densest objects in the universe, formed when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses – to better understand their behaviour. “Finally we have the tools to enable people to do research that they’ve been waiting 30 years to do,” said Sherrill. “It’s like having a new, bigger telescope that can see further into the universe than ever before – only we’ll be seeing further in the nuclear landscape than we’ve ever been able to look before. Whenever you have a new tool like that, there’s the potential for discovery.”",News/Science,New US lab to create versions of atoms never recorded on Earth,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/16/new-us-lab-aims-create-versions-atoms-never-recorded-on-earth
5/17/2022,"A university has said it “does not condone any form of defacement” after one of its staff was pictured throwing an egg at a 20ft bronze statue of Margaret Thatcher. The controversial £300,000 statue was installed in Grantham, Thatcher’s home town, without ceremony over the weekend. Opponents had warned that egg-throwing was “absolutely inevitable” given how divisive a figure Thatcher remains. When it emerged last year that the local council was planning to spend £100,000 on an unveiling ceremony, a Facebook group proposed an egg-throwing contest. It attracted 13,000 expressions of interest. On Sunday morning it took less than two hours for an egg to be thrown at the statue, which stands on a 10ft plinth. The Grantham egg-thrower was later identified as Jeremy Webster, deputy director of the University of Leicester’s Attenborough Arts Centre. Clips of the incident on social media have been deleted. On Monday Kerry Law, the university’s chief marketing and engagement officer, said: “The University of Leicester has a longstanding history of supporting art, fostering creativity and protecting creative freedom. “It does not condone any form of defacement and takes any act of defacement extremely seriously. This matter will be addressed in line with the university’s own procedures.” Lincolnshire police have said they are investigating reports of criminal damage. The statue, made by the sculptor Douglas Jennings, was commissioned by the Public Memorials Appeal, a charity set up to commission statues, busts and plaques of people of historical importance in their chosen fields. It had been hoped it might be erected in Parliament Square. After Westminster council turned the proposal down, it was offered to Grantham and work to achieve that was spearheaded by Grantham Community Heritage Association (GCHA), the educational charity that manages the museum. Two CCTV cameras had been installed around the memorial to help combat any threats of vandalism, South Kesteven council said. Councillor Kelham Cooke, the leader of the council, said the statue was a fitting tribute to a unique political figure. “Margaret Thatcher will always be a significant part of Grantham’s heritage,” he said. “She and her family have close ties with Grantham. She was born, raised and went to school here.” He added: “It is, therefore, appropriate that she is commemorated by her home town, and that the debate that surrounds her legacy takes place here in Grantham. We must never hide from our history, and this memorial will be a talking point for generations to come.” There have been no reports of any further egg-throwing.

5/17/2022,"Gilane Tawadros has been announced as the new director of Whitechapel Gallery, one of the country’s leading art spaces. Tawadros, a curator and writer, is chief executive of DACS, a not-for-profit visual artists rights management organisation, and was previously founding director of the Institute of International Visual Arts (Iniva). She will become one of the few women of colour to lead a big arts institution in the UK when she takes up the new post in October, replacing Iwona Blazwick – who steps down after more than 20 years in the role. “As a passionate advocate for the critical value of art and artists to everyone in society, I am thrilled to have this opportunity to lead one of the world’s most pioneering cultural institutions,” Tawadros said in a statement. “I look forward to working in close collaboration with Whitechapel Gallery’s board and team, artists, and communities in east London, across the country and the globe, to shape a future for the gallery that is bravely responsive to the pressing socio-political and environmental context of our time.” Speaking to the Guardian, Tawadros added that it was a “very particular moment” for cultural institutions because of “the climate crisis, what’s happening in Ukraine, but also what seems like deepening social and political divides. We have to think deeply about what the role of the contemporary art gallery is,” she said. “It’s an opportunity to think and reflect on what’s going on in the world, as well as to be inspired. We’ve just been through a massive pandemic, and we will bear the scars of that. Many of us during the pandemic turned to music, art, literature and film and realised how important those things are. The question of the role of arts and culture is a really important one.” An art historian by training, Tawadros has curated a number of exhibitions nationally and internationally, and written and edited several books. An anthology of her writings, The Sphinx Contemplating Napoleon: Global Perspectives on Contemporary Art and Difference was published by Bloomsbury in 2021. She said she hopes her appointment will inform the future programme of the gallery as well as the diversity of its audiences. “Throughout my career, I’ve always been interested in how different voices, perspectives and world views are represented in cultural institutions, because in many ways they hold up a mirror to people’s experiences. That’s really important to me, and really important in terms of the Whitechapel Gallery. It’s located in London, in one of the most culturally diverse locations in the country. The critical thing is to make sure that change is a lasting structural change.” Dr David Dibosa, the chair of Whitechapel Gallery trustees, said he was overjoyed by the appointment of Tawadros, who brings decades of experience to the role. “She believes in the role of art in society and knows how to equip institutions to play their part. Throughout her career, Gilane has remained committed to artists alongside all those who help to bring their work into public view,” he said. Over more than three decades, Tawadros has explored questions of race and inequality in culture and society. She began her career in gallery education, establishing the first education programmes at the Hayward Gallery in the 1990s. In 2008, she pursued postgraduate research in human rights at Birkbeck, University of London, where she looked at rights and representations in the work of contemporary artists. She is a founding trustee and chair of the Stuart Hall foundation, an organisation committed to public education. Tawadros also established the Art360 Foundation in 2014, a charity dedicated to supporting artists’ legacies for future generations.",Arts/Art and design,Gilane Tawadros appointed director of Whitechapel Gallery,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/16/gilane-tawadros-appointed-director-of-whitechapel-gallery
5/17/2022,"After the customary red band MPAA warning that only “appropriate audiences” have their approval to watch the following preview, the trailer for Jerrod Carmichael’s new film On the Count of Three has a second, unusual title card. A trigger warning states that the clip contains “subject matter related to mental health and suicide,” then lists contact information for call line and text line support services catering to those at risk. It’s plain to see that studios Annapurna and Orion have taken a cautious approach to the release of the black comedy, and it’s equally plain to see why; in Carmichael’s directorial debut, he also stars as a dead-end sad sack who busts his best friend (Christopher Abbott, American indie cinema’s ace in the hole) out of a mental facility so they can end their lives together, on their own terms. A buzzy premiere at Sundance in 2021 brought positive reviews and a $2m deal, but Annapurna and Orion shelved the title for nearly a year and a half until the quietly promoted release this past weekend. Any apprehension on their part is understandable, insofar as suicide and public shootings appear to be the last third-rail taboos remaining in an American culture saturated by depictions of violence. On these hot-button topics, the question of responsibility in art turns from a classroom seminar prompt to a high-stakes matter of public safety, though the link between media and real-world action remains a point of ardent debate. The good news for all involved is that Carmichael’s work is sound, keenly aware of a tone that finds the bleak humor in despondence without making light of it. All the same, the film can’t help its place in a delicate conversation about the fraught intersection between aesthetics and content, in which a lack of nuance has and could once again cast a pall over art addressing our harshest realities with due sensitivity. In a big-picture historical sense, this thicket of live-wire discourse is all Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s fault. His seminal 1774 epistolary novel The Sorrows of Young Werther enumerated the many tribulations of history’s first emo kid, a heartsick artist down so bad for his unattainable crush that he kills himself. An overnight sensation, the book counted among its fans Napoleon Bonaparte and legions of similarly depressed men who saw a kindred in Werther, killing themselves in the earliest documented instances of copycat suicide. The so-called “Werther Effect” has been critiqued as a pop-psych rumor by Goethe scholars and scientists alike, but belief in its cultural impact has only strengthened in the interim centuries. We reserve a special scorn for film and TV seen to glorify suicide as beautiful or empowering, its sins running deeper than mere badness; it’s about actively doing bad, condoning harmful thinking in a presumed audience susceptible to suggestion. Teen weepies go to this well of pathos with less shame than most, the reprehensible All the Bright Places a perfect illustration of the curdled emotional logic at play. The moody Violet has been feeling down over her survivor’s guilt from the car crash that claimed her sister, and snaps out of it in the wake of a fling with the unstable-in-a-hot-way Finch, who underscores the preciousness of life by bringing his own to a premature close. The main offender of recent vintage remains the Netflix series 13 Reasons Why, in which a teen’s cassette-tape suicide notes inspire those who wronged her in life to take a look at themselves and improve. Regardless of its potential to spur imitators, this setup endorses the noxious, misguided “you’ll all be sorry when I’m dead” mindset undergirding much suicidal ideation. (Netflix removed a graphic scene from the first-season finale in the wake of swift controversy.) On the Count of Three would superficially seem to belong to this unsavory tradition, the end result of its to-be-or-not-to-be routine a realization that “it’s a great day to be alive,” as the Travis Tritt song of the same name announces on the soundtrack. But the road to this well-worn insight isn’t quite so trite, starting with the use of that country-western ballad, sung by a urinating coworker as Val (Carmichael) attempts to kill himself. An existentially bruising promotion from shoveler of mulch to overseer of mulch leaves him wondering what it’s all for, but his answer of “nothing” is disrupted by the tinny sound of a pee-stream and pitchy belting of lyrics that might as well be mocking him. Rather than die under such undignified circumstances, he retrieves Kevin (Abbott) from the institution in which he’s recuperating from the latest in a long series of self-destructive episodes. As they tie up loose ends around town over the following day, Val comes to see that he’s not on the same precipice as Kevin, and that his life may be better off fixed than truncated. A conventional endpoint lands with greater generosity and credibility for the mordant sense of humor in the lead-up to it. Small, humiliating absurdities like the tragicomic bathroom tableau regularly punctuate the film’s gloom, unavoidable when your every action is pregnant with dark significance. Val confronts his abusive absentee father, which devolves into a fistfight as a novelty “Frankie the Fish” wall plaques warbles its tune in the background. A half-baked plot to take revenge on a predator from Kevin’s childhood goes awry due to scheduling complications and poor logistical planning. A diner breakfast is interrupted by a former high school bully chuckling as he reminisces about the good ol’ days that put Kevin through hell. Screenwriters Ari Katcher and Ryan Welch evince an intimate awareness that in moments of deep misery, every little thing feels like God having a laugh at your expense. In this respect, the combination of high-proof despair and gallows comedy isn’t contradictory, but rather inevitable. Carmichael’s attunement to this bone-dry comic sensibility speaks to an overall authenticity that makes all the difference, distancing his methods from the cheap exploitation of sadness observable in less mature takes on suicide. More than a narrative device, Kevin and Val’s pain reads as a real ailment afflicting real people, and with that accomplished, Val’s eventual change of heart has just as much weight as his despondence. If this (or any) film can move a viewer to do something drastic for the better, shouldn’t we accept a corollary capacity to influence for good?

5/17/2022,"Wyoming congresswoman Liz Cheney has accused her Republican party leadership of enabling “white nationalism, white supremacy, and antisemitism”, in a scathing message after the racist massacre at a grocery store in Buffalo. Cheney, who was removed from her position as the No 3 House Republican last year after she joined the panel investigating the 6 January Capitol attack, urged party leaders in a tweet to “renounce and reject these views and those who hold them”. The House GOP leadership has enabled white nationalism, white supremacy, and anti-semitism. History has taught us that what begins with words ends in far worse. @GOP leaders must renounce and reject these views and those who hold them. Her remarks were made amid increasing scrutiny of Republican figures who have embraced the racist “great replacement theory” the Buffalo killer is said to have cited in a manifesto he used to justify the murders. The far-right ideology expounds the view that immigration will ultimately destroy white values and western civilization. Although a growing number of Republican lawmakers and hopefuls have promoted the discredited conspiracy theory, including JD Vance, the Donald Trump-endorsed candidate who won last week’s Republican Senate primary in Ohio, many believe Cheney’s message is directed at one person: the Republican House conference chair, Elise Stefanik. The New York congresswoman, who was swiftly installed to replace Cheney when the House minority leader and Trump loyalist, Kevin McCarthy, orchestrated Cheney’s ouster last year, has used the great replacement theory to make false accusations that Democrats were plotting a “permanent election insurrection” by replacing white voters with immigrants. The Illinois congressman Adam Kinzinger, who is the only other Republican on the House panel investigating Trump’s insurrection efforts, posted his own tweet slamming Stefanik’s promotion of the theory as “despicable”. On Sunday he added another post, demanding that Stefanik, McCarthy and extremist Republican congress members Marjorie Taylor Greene and Madison Cawthorn be “replaced”. McCarthy is one of five Republicans who received subpoenas from the House panel last week as it seeks more information about Trump’s actions to overturn his election defeat by Joe Biden, including the deadly riots at the Capitol on 6 January 2021. Stefanik, meanwhile, has been furiously tweeting this morning, doubling down on her claims that Democrats are purposely manipulating immigration policy “specifically for political and electoral purposes”.",News/US news,Liz Cheney says Republican leadership has ‘enabled white supremacy’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/16/liz-cheney-republican-leadership-enabled-white-supremacy
5/17/2022,"Coleen Rooney has said Rebekah Vardy’s private WhatsApp messages were “just evil”, as she finished giving evidence in the “Wagatha Christie” libel trial. The court has previously heard that Vardy and her agent Caroline Watt had lengthy WhatsApp exchanges about Rooney’s personal life, in which Rooney was allegedly branded a “nasty bitch” and a “cunt”. Rooney told the high court she spent months posting fake Instagram stories and restricting their audience to just Vardy’s account, in an effort to work out who was passing stories about her private life to the tabloid newspaper. She said did not inform anyone – including her husband, Wayne - that she was conducting a months-long sting operation into who was leaking stories from a private Instagram account to the Sun. Rooney said she stayed quiet because she did not want to suggest Vardy was leaking stories to the paper without being certain: “I don’t like to do something if I’m not 100% sure myself. I wouldn’t mention it to someone with the smallest little bit of doubt.” “One thing I don’t like to do is put my troubles or worries on anyone else,” she said. “I don’t like to put pressures on anyone. I try to deal with things in silence myself. That’s something I’ve always done.” Rooney said Vardy had told a “lot of lies” during the legal proceedings and insisted she only made the public accusation that Vardy was the leaker as a last resort to try to finally stop stories about her private life appearing in the newspaper. Vardy denies being responsible for the leaks and is suing Rooney for libel. Rooney concluded that Vardy’s account was responsible after another story apparently sourced to her private Instagram appeared in the Sun in October 2019. She then wrote her post accusing Vardy in longhand with a pen and notepad, before sending it to her brother to format for uploading to the internet. Hugh Tomlinson QC, for Vardy, undertook textual analysis of Rooney’s central accusation that “It’s……… Rebekah Vardy’s account” that did the leaking. He said Rooney’s entire public accusation against Vardy had been written in the style of a “whodunnit” with a dramatic reveal emphasised by the large number of dots, a style decision he suggested was designed to inflict maximum damage. Rooney insisted that she often writes messages in that style: “I use dots a lot … I have dots in a lot of conversations.” Vardy’s legal team have repeatedly criticised Rooney’s failure to follow standard journalistic practice, such as requesting a comment from Vardy before publishing her accusation. Rooney said she decided not to go to Vardy before posting the accusation in public: “I know it sounds tough – but at the time I didn’t think she would tell the truth even if I confronted her.” She also feared Vardy would try to brief friendly journalists if she had advance warning: “I thought if I did approach her she might twist it and she might say it wasn’t her, cover up somehow, and then not be trustful. So I didn’t give her opportunity.” Rooney said her suspicions were raised further when she briefly blocked Vardy from the private Instagram account in early 2019 and Vardy messaged to complain about the decision. Rooney said she would not have been that concerned if someone had blocked her: “I’d probably think, ‘oh well I’m not on their account any more’. I wouldn’t be that bothered.” At one point the court heard an extensive discussion of whether it is correct that photographs uploaded directly to Instagram stories are automatically saved as a copy on an iPhone’s camera roll. Rooney told the court she found the entire “Wagatha Christie” label baffling and regularly monitored her own press coverage: “I do Google News and put my name in and read any relevant articles that come up.” She said the WhatsApp messages involving Vardy and her agent that had been disclosed to the court were “just evil and uncalled for, speaking about something you don’t know”. Rooney insisted anyone could have have carried out her sting operation and it did not take much technical knowhow: “It wasn’t hard. Anyone could do it. It worked for me and I found out which account was doing it at the end of it.” The trial continues.",News/UK news,"Rebekah Vardy’s WhatsApp messages ‘just evil’, Coleen Rooney tells court",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/rebekah-vardys-whatsapp-messages-just-evil-coleen-rooney-tells-court
5/17/2022,"Russian forces have shelled frontline positions in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas area as fighting becomes increasingly focused on Severodonetsk, the easternmost city still held by Ukrainian forces after more than 11 weeks of war. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk region, said on Monday that Russian strikes had hit a hospital in the city over the weekend, killing two and injuring nine, including a child – and several other locations had been targeted. Ukrainian forces repelled 17 attacks on Sunday, he added, and destroyed 11 Russian armoured vehicles. The air force command said Ukrainians downed two helicopters, two cruise missiles and seven drones. The Russians are gradually mounting an assault on Severodonetsk, an industrial city that had a population of 100,000 before the war, as the effort to complete a wider encirclement of Ukraine’s defending forces in the Donbas appears to have failed. Overnight the US Institute for the Study of War said it believed “Russian forces have likely abandoned the objective of completing a large-scale encirclement of Ukrainian units from Donetsk City to Izium” in favour of capturing the remainder of the Luhansk region, of which Severodonetsk is part. A smaller-scale encirclement of Severodonetsk also failed last week after Russian forces were defeated with heavy losses in a series of unsuccessful attempts to cross the Siverskyi Donets River at Bilohorivka. The river is increasingly becoming a dividing line between the two sides in the Donbas – the name given collectively to the Donetsk and Luhansk regions – and around Kharkiv to the north. The scale of the Bilohorivka defeat, in which more than 70 Russian vehicles were estimated to have been destroyed, based on aerial photography of the battle site, has also led some Russian military bloggers to comment “on the incompetence of the Russian military to their hundreds of thousands of followers”, the institute said, a rare sign of internal dissent. Haidai said battles were taking place on Sunday to the north and south of Severodonetsk, which is one of the few locations held by Ukraine on the east side of the river. Analysts believe there may be a long struggle for the city. Konrad Muzyka, the founder of Rochan Consulting, which specialises in open source intelligence, said he believed the capture of Severodonetsk was weeks away. “Moscow … does not have the appropriate manpower and equipment levels to take the city swiftly,” he said in a weekly review of the fighting. British military intelligence estimated on Sunday that Russia had lost about a third of the ground combat force deployed in February, and its Donbas offensive, which started in April, had fallen “significantly behind schedule”, making only gradual progress. On Monday, the British also highlighted that Belarus, which is supporting Russia, had announced “the deployment of special operations forces along the Ukraine border” – most likely to “fix Ukrainian troops” in Kyiv and Kharkiv so they cannot reinforce the forces defending in the Donbas. Overall, Russia has made significant territorial gains during the 11 weeks of fighting, capturing the south coast from Kherson to Mariupol – where fighting around the steel plant continues – and 90% of Luhansk. Gen Sir Richard Barrons, a former commander of UK Joint Forces Command, said the west needed to consider “the peril of annexation” – which is when Russia reaches a point where it believes it cannot advance any more and “may then run a series of sort of faux referenda [that] annexes territory into the Russian Federation”. Speaking on the BBC’s Today programme, Barrons said Moscow may then try to argue that the territory seized now “sits behind the Russian nuclear deterrent”, which would make any Ukrainian counteroffensive that Kyiv hopes to mount in May and June more complex. Ukrainian forces are successfully counterattacking around Kharkiv, with the Russians conducting a fighting withdrawal towards the border in the north and to the Siverskyi Donets east of the city. The city, which had a prewar population of more than 1 million, had been under a state of siege since the beginning of the war. Ukrainian recovery of territory remains limited elsewhere, although its forces are increasingly being supported by the arrival of western military equipment. All but one of 90 155mm howitzers promised by the US have been delivered, US officials have said in the past week. Ukrainian border guards also said they repelled a Russian attempt on Monday morning to send troops into the northern Sumy region, well away from the current frontlines. The border service said Russian forces fired weapons in an attempt to cover a “sabotage and reconnaissance group” crossing the border from Russia. Over the weekend, in western Ukraine near Poland, missiles destroyed military infrastructure and were fired at the Lviv region from the Black Sea, Ukrainian officials said. A missile strike took place in Odesa on Monday, destroying buildings, while 10 civilians were wounded in the southern region of Mykolaiv, the regional council said. Ukrainian troops received a morale boost from the country’s Eurovision song contest victory at the weekend, with some saying it was a sign of battlefield victories to come. “We have shown that we can not only fight, but we can also sing very nice,” said Vitaliy, a soldier bunkered down north of Kyiv.",News/World news,Russia shells frontline positions as fighting focuses on Donbas city ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/russians-and-ukrainians-battle-around-izium-as-sweden-joins-finland-in-nato-bid
