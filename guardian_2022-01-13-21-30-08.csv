1/13/2022,"A proposed UK ban on trophy hunting imports risks undermining the conservation of rhinos, elephants and other endangered wildlife, according to a group of leading scientists and conservationists who said African perspectives have been ignored by the government. On Friday, MPs will vote on a private member’s bill to ban trophy hunting imports while, separately, the government is preparing legislation to ban hunting trophies from thousands of species, including lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants and polar bears.  In an open letter seen by the Guardian and signed by more than 100 scientists, conservationists and African community leaders, the group said the ban is poorly conceived and threatens to reverse conservation gains and undermine the livelihoods of rural communities across sub-Saharan African. It urged the UK government to implement a smart ban that incentivises good practice by prohibiting trophies from “canned” hunting operations, where captive-bred animals are shot at close range, or those that fail to share revenues with local communities. By allowing trophy hunting to continue within the UK, where hunters can pay thousands of pounds to shoot deer, the group said the government was opening itself up to accusations of hypocrisy by banning imports from countries with impressive conservation records such as Namibia and Botswana, where trophy hunting is used to fund conservation. “We understand (and many of us share) the public’s instinctive dislike of trophy hunting. However, the reality is that no alternative land use has yet been developed which equally protects the wildlife and habitats found in these vital landscapes while also generating valuable revenues for local communities. Indeed, where trophy hunting has been subjected to bans, wildlife has often suffered, and conflict with communities has increased,” the letter states. “This is not to claim that trophy hunting is perfect. It is beset with a variety of problems, including but not limited to the inequitable sharing of hunting revenues, inappropriate or poorly observed quotas, corruption and inadequate regulation. But tourism is not a perfect industry either,” it continues. Signatories include the heads of leading conservation NGOs such as Save the Rhino International, academics from the University of Oxford and African community leaders. The IUCN, which oversees the red list of endangered species, established that trophy hunting has supported the conservation of several species, including rhinos, African elephants and markhors, the national animal of Pakistan, and a UN report said that trophy hunting is helping to protect millions of acres of wildlife habitat in sub-Saharan Africa. Community leaders have previously criticised British celebrities for calling for a ban on trophy hunting, naming Ricky Gervais, Joanna Lumley and Piers Morgan in July 2020. Supporters of the trophy hunting import ban argue it will help protect endangered species and end a cruel practice. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has called trophy hunting a “disgusting trade” and his father, Stanley, has campaigned in favour of the ban. But Leslé Jansen, CEO of the NGO Resource Africa, who signed the letter, said the legislation will harm conservation and African livelihoods and undermine the rights of rural communities to use their natural resources. “We have voiced these concerns many times, and have attempted to engage in the process. Why are Africans’ rights, views and conservation successes continually ignored?” she said. Dr Rodgers Lubilo, chairman of a community leaders network covering Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe, called on the government to reconsider the proposed legislation. “We have time and again told our international friends that trophy hunting is part of local rural livelihoods, and we will continue to pursue sustainable use of wildlife for generations to come,” he said. Dr Amy Dickman, a professor of conservation at Oxford University who signed the letter, said: “We shouldn’t base policy on what comedians and celebrities think. We should be basing it on expertise and on local opinion. Those are the two things that count the most. “Ricky Gervais has 14 million followers on Twitter, whereas the African Community Leaders Network, when they post about this, tend to get zero engagement. The people most affected have the smallest platforms,” she said. A Defra spokesperson said: “We are bringing forward ambitious legislation to ban the import of hunting trophies from thousands of species. “This will be one of the toughest bans in the world, and goes beyond our manifesto commitment, meaning we will be leading the way in protecting endangered animals and helping to strengthen and support long-term conservation.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,"‘Poorly conceived’ trophy hunting bill puts wildlife at risk, UK government told",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/13/poorly-conceived-trophy-hunting-bill-puts-wildlife-at-risk-uk-government-told-aoe

1/13/2022,"Cambridge United’s goalkeeping hero Dimitar Mitov hoofs a goal kick straight out of play deep in the Newcastle United half. The five minutes of injury time are up. Kieran Trippier throws it infield to Jonjo Shelvey and receives it back – the 39-year-old Wes Hoolahan doing shuttle runs between the two. Finally, the referee blows the full-time whistle – after holding on for those agonising final 20 minutes or so, the U’s have secured perhaps their most famous victory. The camera focuses on the bemused-looking goalscorer Joe Ironside. He grins uncontrollably before being enveloped by his teammates. I jump out of my chair, clench my fist and just manage to stop myself from emitting the involuntary full-volume “yesssssssssss come aaaaaaaaaaaaaan, fucking get in there” that coincides with any rare moment of Cambridge United success.  I’m alone in my living room 10,475 miles away. My heavily pregnant wife is the only person to celebrate with. It’s four in the morning, so waking her seems inadvisable. I sit down in silence and well up – thrilled, giddy and completely drained. The camera pans up, further and further still – eventually training in on the 5,000 U’s fans up in the sky. A sea of delirious amber and black. And while the pride I have for the players and managers is overwhelming, I am gutted I’m not there in that noise. For the first time in the four months since leaving home, I feel out of place. It’s perhaps no surprise that at that moment of emotional weakness in the middle of the night I feel every one of those 10,475 miles. It’s the first big Cambridge game I think I’ve ever missed. The Cup runs of 1990 and 91: Millwall, Ashton Gate, the 5-1 and the Lee Philpott volley. The Palace quarter-final. Middlesbrough, Wednesday, Arsenal at Highbury. Chesterfield in the play-offs. The LDV Vans humiliation in Cardiff. Lionel Pérez taking, and failing to score, that last-minute penalty. Sheffield Wednesday home and away in the Worthington Cup. Back from three down at the City Ground. The play-off finals to get back into the league – those desperate 10 minutes of added time against Gateshead. Manchester United at the Abbey and Old Trafford. Leyton Orient away on some bloke’s balcony overlooking Brisbane Road last year. I’ve spent the game feverishly tweeting to try to feel involved. Social media might connect you like never before, but it shows you what you’re missing with unnerving immediacy. I wonder how fans who followed this path decades before managed to follow their team. News reaches me of a shout-out from Jeff Stelling: “I can hear him … and he’s in Australia,” he yells, Merse laughing in the background. My phone explodes with congratulatory messages – for the result, and the shout-out. I lie in bed staring at the ceiling. The following morning I blearily explain to my wife what it means for Cambridge United to be first on Match of the Day and I burst into tears. Supporters of big sides will never understand the excitement of getting wall-to-wall national coverage after months or years in the wilderness – however fleeting. I inhale every radio interview over the next 24 hours. I do one of them – with the best right-back on the pitch, George Williams. A week later and I’m still watching Cambridge United’s YouTube clip of the post-game celebrations on a loop, scrolling on Twitter to seek out every fan’s attempt to capture the VAR confirmation of the goal on their phone. I listen to Newcastle United podcasts to just hear them talk about our players. On the Sunday a mate sends me screengrabs of the back pages – but I’d do anything to sit in a cafe with every newspaper, to pore over the same picture of Ironside again and again, to read identical post-game quotes in a variety of different fonts. For years growing up I remember the BBC radio commentators welcoming listeners to the World Service halfway through matches and thinking nothing of it. When I was 18 I moved to Berlin and I recall hearing it from the other side. Some bizarre documentary on the Scout movement in the Ukraine would cut off and be replaced by Mike Ingham, Alan Green and Jimmy Armfield live from Goodison Park. That 45-minute taste of home meant so much. Anyone’s who moved country knows that most of the first few months are just an extended to-do list: an unstinting treadmill of un-Djokovic-like accurate form-filling, sitting on hold, living through the catch-22 of requiring a proof of residence to acquire the proof of residence you’re trying to obtain. Following that – new job, new house, new favourite cafe, new bin day – there hasn’t really been time to feel that yearn for home. And it is clearly trite to mourn missing a football match, given how many people haven’t been able to get home for far more important reasons over these past two years. But it isn’t the game, more what it signifies – and a realisation of what football actually means: the friends I would have cajoled into travelling north, the geordie mates I’d have had a glorious pint with afterwards. This season has been an interesting insight into perspective of the often maligned foreign fan. Held responsible for awkward kick-off times. Incorrectly portrayed as the main supporters of the failed super league. For those around the world who routinely set their alarm for a 2am kick-off and who might get to a game once in their life, perhaps the casual dismissal as “tourists” isn’t particularly fair. There’s an obsession with the definition of a “proper” football fan. The truth is there are many ways to be one. It would border on madness for the Cup exploits of any lower-league side to dictate where you choose to live – most of us have other, more practical considerations. But last Saturday I was 10,475 miles away from where I should have been. Straight after I scanned for flights for the fourth-round weekend.

1/13/2022,"There is only one thing worse than having to thumb your smartphone torch into life so that you can read a restaurant menu: the youthful twentysomething waiter noticing you do so, and bringing you one of those LED clip-on lamps. Short of wheeling the house Zimmer frame to the table for you to use while popping to the loo, there’s nothing better calculated to make you feel like an old git. It’s profoundly irritating, partly because it’s so unnecessary; it’s entirely possible to have moody lighting while also dropping enough on to a table so that those of us whose sight is not quite what it once was can read the damn small print without recourse to Wembley Stadium’s floods. But mostly it’s irritating because it’s a huge own goal. It makes any restaurant seem exclusive; as in it was designed to exclude those of us not in the very first flush of youth. All too often this is literally the case, albeit usually by happenstance. The restaurant business is generally a younger person’s game. Setting them up and running them requires the sort of long hours that those of us with a few years on the clock may no longer find appealing. And people in their 20s and 30s may well have no idea what older customers want or need, simply because they haven’t got there yet. If a restaurateur only wants punters their own age, then fine. Turn down the lights. Turn up the music. Print the menu in six point Comic Sans.  Otherwise, here is my plea: if you’re opening a new hospitality business in 2022 employ someone who is at least in their mid-50s. Ask them to try out the seats. Are they padded enough for an arse that has done an extra 20 years’ sitting? Give them the menu. Is the point size legible without recourse to that torch? Does the lighting help? Does the combination of music and hard surfaces make reasonable conversation difficult for those who might have started to lose the top end of their hearing? Beyond the all-important legal requirements of disability access, what are the stairs down to the loos like for someone who might, say, have a hip or knee replacement in their future? Are they well lit? And if you’re using gendered toilets, are the door signs obvious or are they bloody annoying? (The latter has nothing to do with age. Stupid loo door signs are always infuriating.) Not doing all of this is just bad business. Restaurants really ought to be welcoming to all those with the money to spend, and who has more of that? According to the most recent (pre-pandemic) survey of household income from the Office for National Statistics it is the over-50s. Which isn’t really surprising, because they’re the ones further into their careers and their households tend to be smaller. It doesn’t mean you have to target your restaurant at them, unless you want to; it just means you shouldn’t actively create a hostile environment. Given the massive hospitality industry staff shortages, employing older people also makes another kind of sense. The group that owns the Wolseley, the Delaunay and others in London actively recruits older staff. As co-founder Jeremy King put it not long ago: “There is so much experience and knowledge, or should be, among people who have lived a life compared to someone only a year or so outside of college.” Those of us greying and thickening around the edges shouldn’t be invisible. It’s nice to have a waiter who’s a grownup now and then. Not least because, if they’re working there, I can be pretty sure I’ll be able to read the damn menu.",Lifestyle/Food,There’s nothing worse than a restaurant that makes you feel like an old git | Jay Rayner,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/13/nothing-worse-than-a-restaurant-that-makes-you-feel-like-an-old-git-jay-rayner
1/13/2022,"In 1985, Régis Airault arrived in India to work as the resident doctor of psychology at the French consulate in Mumbai. At the time, travelers from France, upon arriving in India, could visit the consulate to place their passport and return plane ticket into safe-keeping. Airault had the opportunity to speak to those travelers, often in their 20s or early 30s, soon after they landed in India. All were excited about their forthcoming travels.  But soon, Airault began noticing a curious condition in some of the French travelers, particularly among those who had spent longer periods of time in the country: a spectrum of behavioral and psychological changes that later became known as “India syndrome”. The condition has cousins around the world: religious tourists to Jerusalem are struck with a spontaneous psychosis upon visiting the city, certain that they are hearing God or in the presence of saints; visitors to Florence are physically overcome, even hallucinate, upon viewing the beauty of the city’s art. In India, Airault would be dispatched to examine travelers who had lost their bearings, had become disoriented and confused, or had found themselves in manic and psychotic states. The contrast was shocking. “I would see them perfect when they arrive and after one month, I would see them totally unstable,” he recalls. Initially, what Airault observed was blamed solely on drug use, but many of the travelers were also exhibiting symptoms such as depression and isolation, stemming from a feeling of disorientation in an unfamiliar land or culture. In rare cases, others were later diagnosed with acute psychosis, delirium and delusion. At its most powerful, India syndrome could be all-consuming, leading to a complete detachment from reality or an overwhelming disconnection from familiarity. Airault came to call that group “the travelers who were lost forever”. Over the decade that followed, the French psychiatrist traveled back and forth between France and India researching and compiling notes and observations into a thesis, which he adapted into a book, published in 2000, called Fous de l’Inde – Crazy About India – which revolves around a central question: does India itself bring forth these transformations, or do people go there determined to be transformed? “More than any other country,” he wrote about travelers from the west, “India has a way of stimulating the imagination and stirring intense aesthetic emotions which can at any moment plunge the traveler into utter anxiety. For this reason, our ‘experience’ of India can be somewhat ambivalent.” This depends on each person’s personal history, their ‘impulse to travel’ and past traumas which have been buried deep inside,” he wrote. “The subconscious has a way of bringing us face-to-face with them at certain times of our lives. Because India speaks to the unconscious: it provokes it, makes it boil and, sometimes, overflow. It brings forth, from the deep layers of our psyche, the buried.” Airault distinguished the symptoms of India syndrome from common culture shock, the experience of travelers either feeling an intense connection to a new and different place or feeling an extreme rejection and disconnection from it. Culture shock often manifests within days of arriving; India syndrome, rather, typically emerges after weeks or months of residing in the country. He noted that many travelers arrive with some deep-rooted idea of what India is, previously held expectations of what India can offer – emotionally, physically or spiritually – and a hardened determination to realize that imagined experience: “The trip to India begins early, with the idea that we have made, conveyed by our culture, its cliches, its legends, its myths, but also by our childhood fed by marvelous tales and stories.” He included dozens of examples of foreign travelers he observed or treated: one had burned his passport shortly after arriving and spent two months in prison suffering from anxiety attacks; one had been wandering around India, in good health and spirits, for five years even as his parents had presumed him dead; and another had traveled to the holy city of Varanasi and believed that the goddess Kali could hear his dreams and was speaking to him. Many of the cases were more benign: travelers arriving with an emotional or traumatic history that was suddenly brought to the surface and confronted, which resulted in a breakdown. Much of what psychiatrists have noted as India syndrome, however, is rooted in an exaggerated and sometimes misplaced expectation for what travelers believe India might offer. They leave home expecting enlightenment at the pinnacle of their journey and stop at nothing in their pursuit. Though India syndrome, like many of its cousins, is not universally recognized or officially accepted as a psychological diagnosis, the symptoms have become enough of a concern that insurance companies selling travel packages to India-bound tourists have been known to include clauses that void the coverage if the traveler has a psychiatric history or if he or she takes drugs. Several embassies and consulates in India have permanent psychiatrists on staff to address and treat their nationals in distress. If they don’t, they contact a psychiatrist such as Sunil Mittal, who has built a career in part on diagnosing and treating the conditions that arise from India syndrome. As the senior psychiatrist at the Cosmos Institute of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences, Mittal sees approximately one foreign tourist every week in his office in New Delhi who would fall under the umbrella of India syndrome. The tourists arrive at the clinic through the recommendation of an embassy, in response to the concerned pleas of a family member, or as the result of an arrest made by police. Mittal breaks down cases of India syndrome into two categories. The first occurs among those who arrive as simple tourists but bring with them some emotional or psychological issue or trauma relating to their family, their job, their relationships, or their past. “They come with a turmoil and they have a breakdown here,” Mittal explains. At the core of the person, he says, lies a vulnerability, a deep-rooted issue that he or she hopes to resolve. The second group is made up of those who come to India determined to embark on some form of spiritual journey to seek higher meaning or realization. They visit holy centers and sites and immerse themselves in training and study of meditation or yoga. They often become enamored by yogis or gurus, or the juxtaposition between what is expected and reality, and seek an extreme break from their life back home. “On the path of a spiritual quest, all the values that have been ingrained in someone are questioned,” Mittal says. “This can lead to a state of emptiness, a state of loss of direction, or a sudden feeling of exaltation – and then not knowing how to handle a situation.” Though drug use is rarely the only spark, it is often an accelerant. Cannabis has been consumed in India for centuries in three forms. The most common is bhang, prepared with ground-up leaves and seeds that are mixed into a drink like a yogurt-based lassi. Ganga is the flowering buds of the cannabis plant, most often consumed by smoking. And charas, or hash, is produced by rubbing the sticky resin off the leaves and buds of the plant until it forms balls that are smoked in a straight clay pipe. Records of cannabis use in Ayurvedic medicine date back a millennium. But the plant most famously appears in Hindu mythology as a favorite of Shiva. In 1986, India made the cultivation, consumption and sale of all forms of cannabis illegal, despite its continued use by sadhus and international tourists alike. The convoluted gray area that cannabis occupies – semi-illegal, openly used ceremonially – has tempted many foreign tourists to experiment. The results can be overwhelming. “It’s like a bomb,” Mittal says. The new lens that the traveler begins to see through can distort even the surest of convictions, replacing hesitation with complete openness, skepticism with blind trust. The lens can undoubtedly offer positive experiences, but also more extreme results. For a 2007 paper on the forces that push international tourists in India to renounce their lives, the Indian anthropologist Meena Khandelwal interviewed three foreigners who had moved permanently to India to pursue a spiritual journey and noted that a US consulate official in New Delhi had told her that “his office may see about 25 Americans each year who have exhausted financial resources and alienated family members in the United States”. Changes can manifest themselves subtly at first, as strong culture shock. Some begin to wear one of the many forms of Indian sari. They carry walking sticks, wear red threads tied around their wrists denoting blessings and sport long necklaces. Travelers who are not Hindu or Muslim or Buddhist or Jain before arriving become, at least in appearance, a model example of a convert. They stay in ashrams or monasteries, where they study and learn, reform their lifestyle or system of belief, or preach asceticism. Over his career, Mittal has treated hundreds of cases across a spectrum of severity. There was the American man found wandering near the Taj Majal, disoriented and confused. After noticing the man behaving bizarrely, the owner of a roadside eatery called the police. The US embassy was contacted and the man then sent to Mittal’s clinic. He determined that the man had arrived in the city of Agra like any other tourist; he had not been on a spiritual journey but simply wanted to see the iconic mausoleum. There, he had tried cannabis, something he had smoked back home with no adverse effects, but this time it had proved overwhelming. He arrived at the clinic unable to answer more than basic questions. “He left everything – his backpack, passport, everything – and just ran away,” Mittal says. Within a month of his return to the United States, he had returned to his normal self. Then there was the British woman who had been living alone for a year in a small cottage in the mountains of the state of Uttarakhand. Locals had become concerned after she had begun behaving and talking strangely and stopped paying her rent. When police arrived, she claimed she had been captured by spirits. Her family contacted Mittal, who saw that she was on a path to a complete renunciation of her previous life. And there was the American woman in her 20s who had been traveling in India before withdrawing from contact with home – one of the more severe cases Mittal has seen. After months of searching, she was found living in an ashram in Rishikesh and performing erotic, half-naked dances each night. When confronted by Mittal’s team, she was adamant that she was an apsara, a female mythological spirit who tempts yogis and priests to test their resolve in celibacy. She assured Mittal that she was fine and that this was her path, but she appeared to be in a trancelike state. For both Airault and Mittal, in most cases, the treatment is simple: a plane ticket home. But in other, more severe cases, the experiences of some individuals in India can leave permanent marks on their behavior even after they return home. In one case, a Japanese tourist had been reported missing and was tracked to Varanasi, where he had had a psychotic episode and been detained by police after trying to board a train without a ticket. When he was brought to the clinic, Mittal found him to be suffering from schizophrenia and sent him home to Japan. Four years later, he reappeared at the clinic, asking to be hospitalized. “He felt he was going to be safe in India,” Mittal says. “At one end, it could be a true pursuit,” Mittal explains, “and for somebody else it could result in a psychotic state.” At this darker end, some travelers come to believe that they are inhabited by spirits or are a god incarnate. Others place themselves in dangerous situations by pushing themselves to increasingly greater extremes in their search for spiritual fulfillment. As Airault concluded in Fous de l’Inde, there are some “who wander aimlessly, in another world and without desire, sheltered from emptiness, suffering and life … At the end of the road, the limit may be death.”  Lost in the Valley of Death: A Story of Obsession and Danger in the Himalayas, is out now",Lifestyle/Life and style, ‘Travelers who were lost forever’: why tourists experience ‘India syndrome’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/13/india-syndrome-lost-in-the-valley-of-death-harley-rustad
1/13/2022,"If someone said: here’s loads of money, but we get the right to CGI you into movies for ever after you die, would you accept? LarboIreland I’ve been in about 80 movies already. I guess part of being an actor is there’s some immortality. That’s why people are interested in showbusiness, because you kind of live for ever. So maybe I would. It depends how bad the movies are.  Was the bust up between you and Jean-Claude Van Damme staged for publicity? Granadapanda The one in Cannes was staged. It got a little bit heated … I think somebody pushed my ex-wife into somebody. I can’t remember, but it was Jean-Claude’s idea. He’s a showman. How did they make you look like a giant in comparison with Stallone? LeaderOfTheFree I am taller than him [Lundgren is 1.96m (6ft 5in), Stallone 1.77m (5ft 9in)], so it’s all about camera angles. A lot of times, they put me on a box. When I come into the press conference in my uniform, I have lifts in my shoes. Stallone was clever to exaggerate the difference. Less talented actors would try to make themselves look bigger against the other guy, but he knew that, by building up the opponent, it made him look better at the end. Did you really hospitalise Sly while making Rocky IV? mrnobody74 I don’t know. He keeps talking about it, so maybe he’s right. He did go to the hospital, but I don’t know whether it was my punches or the fact that he was so overworked as the director, actor and writer. We shot those 15 rounds over two or three weeks, eight or 12 hours a day, so you’re throwing thousands of punches. If you don’t connect, it looks a bit fake, but it doesn’t mean you want to hurt the other guy. But there were no hard feelings. Did you use a stand-in? Hamble Back in the day, you had to do it all yourself: Rocky IV, The Punisher, Masters of the Universe, all the Expendables. I’ve jumped from a motorcycle to a truck; dangerous things I would never do now. Staying physically fit over the years has been nice. There aren’t many actors who can stay physically fit for a long time. Part of the game is trying to look fit, at least. Did your depiction of a Russian fighter gain you any respect in the Soviet Union? duffdawg I think so. When the Soviet Union fell in 1991, Rocky and Universal Soldier came out on VHS and were the first western films Russians were allowed to watch. They don’t have that many international movie stars in Russia, so they’ve adopted me to some degree. Do you still follow Everton? What do you reckon this season? Vammyp I follow soccer a bit, but it’s difficult in America, because you have to be a diehard fan to find out when it’s on TV. I prefer the World Cup or the Olympics, when it’s a big deal. The Swedish ladies were pretty good in Tokyo, but lost [in the final] against Canada. Belgium had a good team – a lot of big guys. Coleslaw or mayonnaise on a ham sandwich? Twatacus1 I would say mayonnaise. Hur ofta besöker du Sverige? Skulle du kunna flytta tillbaka till Skandinavien som oldie? [How often do you visit Sweden? Could you move back to Scandinavia as an oldie?] MissPiStorm I visit a couple of times a year. My fiancee [the personal trainer Emma Krokdal] is from Norway, so we’re both Scandinavian. My two brothers and two sisters still live in Sweden. My older half-brother has the same dad, then four of us have the same parents, of which I’m the oldest, so I am still in charge. When we were little, I used to direct my siblings playing soldiers, marching around in different formations. My dad was in the military, so I picked it up from him. They hated it, but were too scared to protest. I don’t know if I’d like to move back. I haven’t thought about it, but for now I like California. Los Angeles is where my job is and I like the lifestyle; it’s quite liberal, you can be who you want to be. People don’t care and leave you alone. The smaller the places, the more rigid the social structure, whereas everybody in LA is a bit of a freak, so I fit right in. Do you remember how to determine the Reynolds number for a Newtonian fluid? DirtyOverThirty Oh, shit. No. It rings a bell way back in my head. Reynolds number has to do with flow characteristics, but I can’t remember exactly. I studied chemical engineering at the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden and got my master’s at the University of Sydney. Then I ran into the singer Grace Jones. We fell in love and moved to New York. I always wanted to act, so I decided to try it, but I never regret studying in college – making friends and the intellectual atmosphere. You take the things you learn with you. They have certainly enriched my life on another level, because acting is pretty limited. The love scene between Grace Jones and Roger Moore in A View to a Kill is really unusual. Do you agree? Leobatch I agree. I was there. She has a love scene with Christopher Walken and she has one with Roger Moore. Roger Moore was a practical joker. He always brought something into bed [scenes] to alleviate the tension, like a sex toy. I think he did the same with Grace, but she knew about it, so I think she brought something, too … I can’t remember what, but it was even more extreme and I don’t think he was ready for it. They have this S&M moment where they wrestle around, if I recall, but it was all in character. I think she did a good job there. Do you ever wear the ear necklace from Universal Soldier when you go out? TeeDubyaBee It’s in storage. The rubber ears are 30 years old, so they’re decomposed and even yuckier than before. Do you still play the drums? themurph100 Very seldom. I played a drummer about 15 years ago [in 2009’s Command Performance]. But I don’t have a kit, because, first of all, it takes up a large space. Second, everybody gets annoyed. I used to have an electronic one, where you just hear it in the headset. Maybe I’ll get one of those. Actually, it’s a good point. I miss it. I really should do it. It’s very relaxing and meditative. Have you ever seen a ghost? ArthurSternom I haven’t seen one, but I think I heard one many years ago in Sweden. I was staying in this 18th-century manor house in the middle of winter with my half-brother and his dad, to go hunting. I woke in the middle of the night, got really cold, felt something in the room and got really scared. I usually don’t get scared. Then I heard this woman speaking on the phone in old Swedish or something, but I couldn’t really make out what was going on. There were no women in the house, but there was one of these old wooden phones outside in the corridor and all these pieces of luggage that used to be owned by my half-brother’s dad’s mother. She had killed herself in the room next to mine, but I didn’t know any of this until the next day. That was the first time I felt that there was something supernatural. I never went back to spend another night in that place. What was it like working with Brandon Lee in Showdown in Little Tokyo? KieranK1982 It was a pleasure. He was a good martial artist, a very good actor and very charismatic, just like his dad. It was very sad what happened. He would’ve been a huge star had he not gotten killed so early. Do you ever imagine yourself as a much older actor, like Max von Sydow, Sir Patrick Stewart or Sir Ian McKellen? A Gan‑Dolph the Grey? Murdomania I’m starting to feel that way, because it creeps up on you. In Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, I play Amber Heard’s dad, this wise old king with a little beard and long hair. I don’t feel like a wise old king, but a lot of the fans watching that movie are maybe 10 or 15 years old. I’m 50 years older, so to them I am a wiser, older actor. It’s interesting, because it’s gone full circle. I got famous young, when I was 27. But I’ve had some hard times in my career. Luckily, in last four or five years, I’ve done Creed II, Aquaman, and I’ve just finished The Expendables 4. I’ve got some interesting scripts I’d like to direct. I’ve done so much action that I really enjoy working on characters more. I don’t miss running around on a motorcycle shooting people, or jumping from a cliff to a plane – I’ve done that. I think it’s more interesting to use maturity and experience as an actor. If you suddenly found yourself a young man in today’s world, what would you pursue? KitRey I had a lot of issues from my childhood that I had to figure out by becoming a fighter and then an actor. It was more like therapy for me. If I was a young man today, I would probably still want to persue acting and directing, but maybe have a chance to train without being thrown into it, which happened in my case. I got famous in one movie and then was suddenly starring in big movies, not really knowing what I was doing. I didn’t have much technique as an actor and I had to figure it out. So, I would probably pursue acting in a more serious way.

1/13/2022,"Sometimes, change is the last thing you want. Yes, in the newfangled world of reality TV, you can now find innovative formats where dates are disposed of via a trapdoor or contestants woo each other without speaking the same language. But 2020 and 2021 were packed with enough plot twists to last a lifetime. This is why the return of TV staple The Apprentice is so welcome. After two years off air, almost everything in the world has changed, bar the show itself. As always, Alan Sugar takes on a crop of business hopefuls who are confident to the point of delusion (which is how one of them actually described themselves in the first episode). Even the first few minutes of its return were characteristically thick with quotables: “I am the EST of everything, which means I am the coolEST, smartEST and wickedEST in businEST”, assured one contestant.  Ffascinatingly, the opening episode took place as though the past few years didn’t happen. Bar the odd reference to the pandemic through Sugar’s bad dad jokes (“You don’t get furloughed, you get fired!”), you would be forgiven for thinking it had been shot pre-Covid. The economic uncertainty, the decimation of the high street and the remote-working revolution were things of neither the past nor the future. The strange time-machine energy was only exacerbated by the addition of the show’s first winner, Tim Campbell, stepping in for Claude Littner, and a contestant introducing the word “bouji” to her entirely baffled team. Watching The Apprentice in 2022 is an exercise in nostalgia, a televisual Delorean to transport us to the simpler time of 2019. It almost feels like the suspension of reality is intentional. Why else would the first task have been to launch a luxury cruise line, after possibly the most disastrous period for the industry in recent years? While the two teams built their rival brands, in the real world, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that every US passenger cruise had Covid cases on board. Meanwhile, the UK is still reeling from the disaster of the Britain-registered Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that was quarantined at Yokohama for a month in 2020 after almost a quarter of its 3,700 passengers were infected with Covid. But this is not a criticism. More often than not, TV is about the suspension of reality – it is why sitcom characters referencing the pandemic can be so grating. If we wanted to watch the news, we would do so. The idea that the boys’ team might encourage a post-pandemic boom in cruises with a logo that – as pointed out by Twitter users – resembled a Covid variant is surely a thing of fantasy. The girls gave them a run for their money in the ineptitude stakes, their cringe-inducing branding not much better than the boys’ anthropomorphic oil spill. It is a demonstration of the show’s commitment to representation; women can be just as belligerent and ridiculous as men, thank you very much. In these times, The Apprentice’s comeback should have felt irrelevant for an endless list of reasons, but the deja vu made it even more enjoyable than usual. At times, the show has appeared allergic to the future; Sugar’s declaration in the opening episode that “TikTok is becoming very powerful” sounded partly fearful. But this time the show’s lack of innovation has worked in its favour. For nearly 20 years, we have been regaled by its familiar, formulaic combining of egos and schadenfreude – and we probably will be for 20 more. If “keep calm and carry on” were a TV format, it would be The Apprentice, the ultimate pair of reality-show safe hands.",Arts/Television & radio,Covid? Never heard of it!

1/13/2022,"The reality TV star Kim Kardashian and boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jr are among celebrities being sued over their promotion of an alleged “pump and dump” cryptocurrency scheme that investors say caused them to lose money. According to a class action lawsuit filed in a California court, executives of EthereumMax, in collaboration with Kardashian, Mayweather Jr and the basketball player Paul Pierce, sought to enrich themselves by making “false and misleading” statements to investors.  Promotions by the company included an Instagram post to Kardashian’s 250 million followers that the head of the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, Charles Randell, said may have had “the single biggest audience reach in history” for a financial product. The value of the company’s EMAX tokens increased by as much as 1,370% after the media marketing blitz before crashing to an all-time low, the suit claims. By using celebrity endorsements, the claimants say, EthereumMax’s executives, “touted the prospects of the company and the ability for investors to make significant returns due to the favourable ‘tokenomics’ of the EMAX Tokens”. Cryptocurrencies are an alternative way of making payments to cash or credit cards. The technology behind it allows the ‘money’ to be sent directly to others without it having to pass through the banking system. For that reason they are outside the control of governments and are unregulated by financial watchdogs – and transactions can be made in a way that keeps you reasonably pseudonymous. If you own a crypto-asset you control a secret digital key that you can use to prove to anyone on the network that a certain amount of that asset is yours. If you spend it, you tell the entire network that you have transferred ownership of it, and use the same key to prove that you are telling the truth. Over time, the history of all those transactions becomes a lasting record of who owns what: that record is called the blockchain. Bitcoin was one of the first and biggest cryptocurrencies and has been on a wild ride since its creation in 2009, sometimes surging in value as investors have piled in – and occasionally crashing back down. Dogecoin – which started as a joke – has also seen a stratospheric rise in value. Sceptics warn that the lack of central control make crypto-assets ideal for criminals and terrorists, while libertarian monetarists enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank. The whole concept of cryptocurrencies has been criticised for its ecological impact, with ""mining"" for new coins requiring vast energy reserves and the associated carbon footprint of the whole system. Richard Partington and Martin Belam Instead, the lawsuit claims, they were concerned with inflating the value of their own tokens in order to sell them at a profit to investors who ended up holding artificially overvalued assets. EthereumMax dismissed the allegations in a statement made via the company’s Twitter account. “The deceptive narrative associated with the recent allegations is riddled with misinformation about the EthereumMax project,” it said. “We dispute the allegations and look forward to the truth coming out.” The deceptive narrative associated with the recent allegations is riddled with misinformation about the EthereumMax project. We dispute the allegations & look forward to the truth coming out.

1/13/2022,"A Conservative MP faces suspension from the Commons after the standards watchdog found he undermined a formal apology over intimidatory behaviour towards staff by indicating in media interviews that he did not fully mean the gesture. Daniel Kawczynski will be asked to make a series of fresh apologies, including to the staff members who originally complained about his actions, and who the Shrewsbury MP effectively identified when talking about the case, the Commons standards committee found.  In an often damning report, the committee, made up of cross-party MPs and outside members, said that even in his latest interactions with the standards process, Kawczynski appeared unable to fully grasp what he had done. “We note that even in his most recent comments to the committee, Mr Kawczynski has focused very much on his own personal ‘journey’ rather than on the damage he may have caused to others,” the report noted. While he understood, intellectually, the damage his comments had caused, the report added, the MP was “still struggling with a capacity for genuine empathy with others, and as a result still has a tendency, which he may not fully realise, to see himself rather than others as the ‘victim’”. While such conduct would normally merit a significant suspension, the committee said, as Kawczynski had committed to undertaking further work on his behaviour the suspension would be limited to one day. Kawczynski apologised in the Commons in June last year after an investigation found he ranted at one senior Commons official, called another a “snowflake” and “useless”, and denigrated a third staff member via WhatsApp, having drunk a “significant” amount of alcohol. Earlier that same day, Kawczynski had spoken to his local BBC radio station and the Daily Mirror, complaining that the process was unfair and that he had no choice but to apologise. In a live radio interview he also identified the specific job of one complainant. This prompted a fresh inquiry into whether the MP had undermined the sincerity of his apology and the wider disciplinary process. Kawczynski’s lawyer argued this was not the case because the interviews happened before the apology. But the committee concluded the comments had been damaging and “risked causing further harm to the complainants and discouraging legitimate potential complainants, who might be concerned that their confidentiality would be compromised”. The committee, which oversees the work of parliament’s commissioner for standards, Kathryn Stone, said Kawczynski should make a new apology in the Commons, including to the complainants and to Stone, and make a “commitment to an improved attitude and behaviour and an invitation to other members to learn from his experience”.",News/Politics,Tory MP faces Commons suspension after undermining bullying apology,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/13/tory-mp-daniel-kawczynski-faces-commons-ban-after-undermining-bullying-apology
1/13/2022,"Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who managed weapons and ammunition on the set of Rust, the western which saw live ammunition from the gun carried by lead actor and producer Alec Baldwin accidentally hit the film’s cinematographer and director, has filed a lawsuit against the supplier of guns and bullets. The lawsuit, against Seth Kenney and his company, PDQ Arm & Prop, alleges that boxes marked as inert dummy rounds actually included live bullets.“Hannah and the entire Rust movie crew relied on the defendants’ misrepresentation that they provided only dummy ammunition,” according to documents in the suit filed in state court in New Mexico.  It was on 21 October that the gun carried by Baldwin discharged during rehearsals for a scene. The bullet killed the film’s cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded its director, Joel Souza. According to the lawsuit, Kenney had worked with Gutierrez-Reed’s father, Thell Reed, who is a prominent Hollywood armourer, around a month before the Rust shoot began, on a different movie set in Texas. Kenney had asked Reed to help train actors to shoot live rounds at a firing range off-set, the lawsuit says. It continues by alleging that Kenney took live rounds from this training, some of which may have ended up on the Rust set. In November, Kenney told Good Morning America he was confident this wasn’t the case. “It is not a possibility that they came from PDQ or from myself personally,” he said, adding that dummy rounds from his company are individually “rattle tested” before dispatch – dummy rounds rattle; live rounds do not. The new lawsuit details Gutierrez-Reed’s actions on set, handing the gun to Baldwin. “Hannah remembered the chamber that she believed needed to be cleaned in Baldwin’s gun and she cleaned it and then Hannah pulled another round from the dummy box, shook it, and placed it in the chamber. To the best of Hannah’s knowledge, the gun was now loaded with six dummy rounds.” Gutierrez-Reed, 24, was paid around $7,500 for her work on the film, which also involved working as a props assistant. Her lawyer has previously claimed that this double role, as well as the “rushed and chaotic atmosphere” on set made it hard for her to fully focus.",Arts/Film,Rust shooting: armourer sues guns and ammunition supplier,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/13/rust-shooting-armourer-sues-guns-and-ammunition-supplier
1/13/2022,"Over Christmas and the new year, three of the world’s leading naturalists died. Thomas Lovejoy, a conservation biologist credited with popularising the term “biodiversity” and a passionate defender of the Amazon, died on 25 December. A day later, Edward O Wilson, known to many as the “modern-day Darwin”, died in Burlington, Massachusetts. On 2 January, Richard Leakey, a world-renowned Kenyan conservationist who helped establish Africa as the birthplace of humankind, died at his home in Nairobi. From presidents to undergraduate students, thousands have paid tribute to the three men, whose achievements range from developing theories on forest and island ecosystems to reforming the Kenyan civil service and devising proposals to protect half the planet for nature. Alongside grand accomplishments, which were sometimes controversial, their passing has been a chance to reflect on the small and the mundane: fleeting interactions that inspired careers, kind words that propelled research projects, and generosity of spirit that has helped amplify the voices of those that practise and produce science.  “There’s a whole generation of diverse ecologists and conservationists following in the footsteps of their work,” says Ricardo Rocha, a conservation ecologist from the island of Madeira, who studies bats and the human drivers of biodiversity loss. Holding books written by all three men, he says they all had a massive impact on his career and improved the diversity of their respective fields. “I’m black and I’m European. These were three white men that consciously and unconsciously helped promote a shift in the demographics of the scientific community.” The Guardian received dozens of responses to a callout about the legacy of Wilson, Lovejoy and Leakey. From funding field studies of indigenous territories in Peru to convincing prospective lawyers to pursue careers in human paleobiology, their impact has been far-reaching. In an email titled “Tom Lovejoy changed my life”, Alexander Nassikas explains how he switched from pursuing a career as a doctor to working on the climate crisis after visiting Camp 41 in the Amazon, where Lovejoy hosted presidents, researchers and celebrities from Tom Cruise to Olivia Newton-John. “He wrote me an email once telling me that he’s counting on me to make a difference in the world,” says Nassikas, who now works for the UN secretary general’s climate action team. Dr Dino J Martins, a renowned Kenyan entomologist and evolutionary biologist at Princeton, who heads the Mpala research centre near Mount Kenya, says his friend Leakey helped forge a path for African researchers to lead research in their own continent. “There is an entire cohort of African scientists who, against the odds, have risen because of Richard inspiring us, fighting for us and making sure we got on and did it,” he says. Dr Ben Okita-Ouma, co-chair of the world’s leading elephant conservation group, agrees. Okita-Ouma was inspired by the photo of Leakey burning ivory tusks in an anti-poaching campaign that was pinned to a noticeboard while he was at university in the early 1990s. They went on to work together at the Kenya Wildlife Service. “He loved and meant what he was doing in conservation, archeology and in dreaming big for Kenya as a nation,” says Okita-Ouma. Dr Corrie Moreau, a professor at Cornell University who founded the Women in Science group, was a student of Wilson’s at Harvard and shared his passion for ants, redrawing the insect’s family tree for her PhD dissertation. She paid tribute to his kindness and openness. Wilson, a prolific writer, wrote all his papers and books on yellow legal tablets, which were then transcribed by his assistant Kathleen Horton, who worked with him from 1965 to 2021. “Science was conducted almost exclusively by this gentleman’s club in the past. Not only did you have to look a certain way, you had to have a certain kind of background and identity,” Moreau says. “Ed saw that in order to really harness the power of our ability to understand the world around us, we had to fling open the doors and invite more people to be involved. I’m some tattooed kid from the south that was passionate about ants. That never interfered with Ed’s ability to see my intellect. That’s not true of a lot of people.” The death of all three men comes at an inflection point in the world’s ecological history. In Wilson’s final lecture in October, he reflected on the three environmental crises humanity will face this century: the climate crisis, a fresh water shortage and biodiversity loss. The new roads, infrastructure and farms that are carving up the Amazon, which Lovejoy wrote about his entire career, will dictate the fate of the world’s largest rainforest. Leakey, who was buried on his favourite ridge overlooking the Rift valley, helped ensure the African elephants and rhinos are there for future generations alongside many other achievements. Colleagues and family members say that despite rising extinctions and growing environmental destruction, Wilson, Lovejoy and Leakey remained optimistic. Lovejoy’s daughters and granddaughters paid tribute to his belief that our species would “figure it out”. For now, all three helped ensure the health of the planet remains an open question. “Giving up is a sure recipe for your worst nightmares becoming reality,” says marine biologist Elliott Norse, who, along with Wilson and Lovejoy, started using the phrase “biological diversity” around the same time in the early 1980s. “They saw bigger things in the patterns of what we do. I am eternally thankful for their contributions to our understanding of the nature of life, including the nature of humankind, and the unthinking things we are doing to our one and only home.” There were too many responses to our callout to include them all but here are a few: Tom Lovejoy was a peerless adviser because of his firm conviction that a healthy environment is the best way to provide quality of life to everyone on the planet.” Adalberto Luis Val, former director of the National Institute of Amazonian Research (INPA). Lovejoy was elected to the Brazilian Academy of Sciences shortly before his death. There will never again be anyone like Tom Lovejoy.” Primatologist Russell Mittermeier, Re:wild’s chief conservation officer, who met Lovejoy as a student at Harvard and was friends with him for half a century. Personally, Tom made it clear to me that I needed to get out more. He showed me the value of breaking out of disciplinary silos and finding partners where I didn’t think to look. He never prescribed or demanded greater breadth. He just asked the right questions at the right time for me to discover for myself the value of thinking differently. I often tell my students that if they walk into a room and know everyone already, they aren’t getting out enough.” Geoffrey Dabelko, professor at Ohio University. Lovejoy helped him start the Wilson Center’s environmental change and security programme in Washington in 1994 with PJ Simmons. The strong foundation [Leakey] laid during his tenure at KWS has helped us more than double Kenya’s elephant population to over 36,000.” Dr Patrick Omondi, former deputy head of the Kenya Wildlife Service. Leakey played a key role in listing African elephants as among the most endangered animals in the world in 1989, resulting in an international ivory trade ban. Had tropical ecologists in the 1970s-1990s deigned to ask their indigenous neighbours about the organisation and dynamics of tropical forests, we all would have made faster scientific progress.” Douglas Yu, a professor of the school of biological sciences at University of East Anglia, who, along with a colleague, was awarded a $32,000 grant in 1999 by Wilson to study Matsigenka indigenous forest classification. The study found indigenous knowledge about the Amazon was a “vast and underutilised database”. I was walking by the swimming pool in the evening before dinner when I spotted Tom Cruise. I thought that he was there shooting some movie in the Amazon. Then I saw Tom Lovejoy. He told me what he was doing, that is, to bring famous people to the Amazon to stress the global importance of protecting the forest and its immense biodiversity. I will never forget that casual and so relevant encounter with Tom. He even introduced me to Tom Cruise and some other actors as a Brazilian scientist concerned with the future of the Amazon, but certainly Tom Cruise will never remember having met me.” Carlos Nobre, a climate scientist at the University of São Paulo who co-authored articles with Lovejoy. Richard Leakey impacted so many people, whether they know it or not. People shape people and undoubtedly my time at the Turkana Basin Institute was shaped by him and countless others. It inspired me to continue on my current journey.” Kailie Batsche, PhD student at the Center for Functional Anatomy and Evolution at John Hopkins. A field trip in the Rift valley inspired her to shift from a career in law to paleoanthropology. He told me he could tell that I would do well in grad school, but also that there were still important questions in human evolution that needed to be answered and that the field needed people like me to continue to make progress and find those answers.” Sarah Baumgarten, PhD candidate in bioanthropology at Washington University, who went on the same field trip as Batsche. It was Baumgarten’s first journey outside the US and Leakey spoke with her about her future in the camp mess. We cannot stay. Entropy takes everything. Yet, although all that we have done and may yet do will be dissipated, the steps that were taken, the path of a life, forgotten or not, remain as real and eternal as the flow of time. I am made happy and feel lucky, that we have shared a goal, and above all, that our paths that have crossed, as we travel onward, on our journey to forever.” Adrian Forsyth, executive director of the Andes Amazon Fund, was a student of Wilson in the mid 1970s and worked with Lovejoy on and off for 40 years.
