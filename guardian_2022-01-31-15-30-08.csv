1/31/2022,"An NHS doctor killed his partner’s father and almost caused the deaths of her and her mother by giving them a poison that is popular among murderers, a London court has ruled. He poisoned the trio with thallium then tried to cover his tracks, did not deploy his medical knowledge to help his partner and lied about what happened, the judge found.  The ruling has been handed down by Mr Justice Williams in the family court at the end of a case between the doctor and his now former partner over the arrangements for the care of their child. The case is highly unusual legally because the medic has been found to have committed the killing in a civil court, on the balance of probabilities of the evidence, rather than in a criminal court, in which a jury has to be sure beyond all reasonable doubt. “It is truly horrifying that any doctor who has signed the Hippocratic oath would be responsible for killing someone else and attempting to kill other people,” said Simon Bruce, a senior family law specialist solicitor who was part of the woman’s legal team.” While most cases that come before the family court involve injuries, harassment and domestic abuse, Bruce added, “the killing of the child’s grandfather, and the attempted killing of the mother and grandmother, are off the scale of unusualness”. The Guardian is unable to disclose the doctor’s name because in the judgment the judge ordered that his identity, the mother of his child and their son had to remain anonymous. However, Williams said in his judgment that the poisoner was a Bulgarian-born doctor who had moved to the UK in the late 2000s. The medic had a relationship with the woman, a bookkeeper and fellow Bulgarian who had been granted British citizenship, and their child was born in 2010. The court found that he added thallium to a pot of coffee when he, his then partner, their then one-year-old child and her parents were on holiday in Bulgaria in September 2012. His partner and her parents drank from the pot while the doctor had instant coffee instead. The child’s grandfather died two days later. The two women became seriously ill but survived. The doctor and his partner separated soon afterwards. The Bulgarian police have made inquiries into the poisoning and interviewed the medic, and the Metropolitan police have also been notified. But he has not been charged with any criminal offence. “The circumstances around my father’s death and the thought of how he had suffered from the effects of the poison in his last hours will haunt me forever. No one could possible imagine the excruciating pain my mother and I felt as a result of the poisoning in the first six weeks after we had been poisoned,” the woman told the Guardian. “Every day I suffer tremendously bearing the thought that I brought a murderer to my parents’ house and that my dad died as a direct result of this. What I have been through is a nightmare.” The doctor began legal action in 2018 in an attempt to gain access to his son after he and his partner separated. She argued that he should not have contact because he had poisoned her parents and herself. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US say that thallium, a heavy metal, “is tasteless and odourless and has been used by murderers as a difficult to detect poison”. After a five-day hearing last year, Williams ruled in favour of the mother. He found that on the balance of probabilities her claim that he had poisoned her and her parents was correct. During the hearing the doctor’s former partner told how he insisted they leave Bulgaria for Britain when the debilitating effects of the poisoning were starting to appear. She said that once back in the UK, he did little to help her get medical help, despite her hair falling out and her suffering sudden weight loss. It was later determined that the woman, her mother and her father had all been poisoned. In what the judge said was a ruse to evade detection for what he had done, the doctor told fellow medics seeking to identify the source of her sickness that she may be suffering from Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare and serious nerve condition. In his judgment Williams several times noted that the doctor had told lies in the different accounts he had given of events surrounding the poisoning. His evidence during the hearing was “rather fractured” and at time “felt like a construct” and he was “insincere” when answering questions, the judge noted. “Overall, I found him to be a quite unsatisfactory witness,” he added. He also noted: “The father as a qualified medical doctor would have had the intellectual capacity to determine the amounts of thallium that would be required to deliver a sufficient dose to kill an individual without delivering such a significant dose as to make it obvious to the consumer of the drink that it had been contaminated.” “At a time when the mother was frantic and had come to believe that she was poisoned, his failure to do anything of substance on the medical front is almost inexplicable save by prior knowledge of the causes,” he added. The doctor is not currently working. The Guardian sought his response to the court judgment. A statement issued by Delphine Philip Law, his solicitors, said: “He vehemently denies the mother’s allegations that he poisoned her or her parents. He stated that the court took inadequate account of the fact that there was no direct evidence to collaborate [his former partner’s] allegations.”",News/Law,"NHS doctor killed his partner’s father with poison, civil court finds",https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/31/nhs-doctor-killed-his-partners-father-with-poison-civil-court-finds
1/31/2022,"The Bank of England is poised to raise interest rates on Thursday amid growing concern over the pressure on households from high inflation in Britain’s cost of living crisis. City economists widely expect the central bank to increase its key rate from 0.25% to 0.5% in response to inflation hitting levels not seen for almost 30 years, with financial markets suggesting a 90% chance of an increase in borrowing costs.  With pressure mounting on households from soaring energy bills and the rising cost of a weekly shop, several leading analysts expect that the Bank’s nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) will vote unanimously for a rise in rates. It comes after the official inflation rate reached 5.4% in December, the highest level since March 1992, driven by soaring gas and electricity prices and the higher cost of food, clothes and footwear. The Bank has warned that inflation could peak at close to 6% by April, three times the 2% target rate set by the government. However, with the economy under pressure since the emergence of the Omicron variant of coronavirus, an increase in borrowing costs is likely to compound difficulties facing businesses in the hardest-hit sectors. Martin Beck, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the Bank’s rate setters would place concerns about high inflation above the impact of Covid-19 on businesses and consumers. It comes after the Bank unexpectedly raised rates in December despite fears over the initial spread of the Omicron wave. “The MPC’s decision to raise bank rate in December regardless indicates that it placed less weight on the virus. And recent developments are likely to reinforce this stance. Covid-19 infections peaked at the start of the January and have been on a declining trend since,” Beck said. Although visits to high streets and spending in pubs and restaurants fell sharply in the run-up to Christmas, economic activity has increased in recent weeks as consumers gradually return to socialising and working in town and city centres. The government dropped all plan B restrictions in England last week, while analysts said the impact of the Omicron variant on the UK economy appeared to have been relatively modest. Steffan Ball, the chief UK economist at Goldman Sachs, said the MPC would probably vote 9-0 to raise borrowing costs on Thursday, and could lift interest rates to as high as 1.25% by November this year. “We now expect the Bank of England to hike in back-to-back meetings through May, in order to demonstrate to markets and businesses that the MPC is serious about the inflation target,” he said.",News/Business,Bank of England poised to raise interest rates as high inflation takes toll,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/31/bank-of-england-poised-to-raise-interest-rates-as-high-inflation-takes-toll
1/31/2022,"In the next week Great Britain’s energy regulator will announce the steepest rise ever in its energy price cap, effectively saddling millions of households with an annual energy bill of close to £2,000. The blow to household finances follows almost six months of record high energy market prices because of the global gas crisis. Despite the deepening gloom facing bill payers, ministers are yet to agree a package of measures to prevent a national energy crisis.  After a fourfold surge in energy market prices across Europe, households will pay an average of 54% more for energy this year than in 2020, according to Bank of America. The bank warned that the biggest increases would be felt by Italy and the UK. While European governments have moved to protect households from the full brunt of the global energy crisis, the UK government has remained silent. The UK’s failure to act comes despite desperate calls from groups representing vulnerable households, small businesses and economists, which fear that record high energy bills threaten to unlock economy-wide inflation and a cost of living crisis. In Great Britain the next energy price increase is scheduled to be announced on 7 February, and households will be hoping that new support measures can be agreed before it takes effect from 1 April. Potential measures include cutting the 5% rate of VAT on energy bills, or moving the policy costs levied on energy bills to general taxation. More radical ideas include setting up a “stabilisation mechanism” to give top-up payments to energy suppliers depending on the market price. The Labour party has thrown its weight behind a plan to subsidise bills by introducing a windfall tax on the profits made by North Sea oil and gas producers during the crisis. The Treasury is expected to remain tight-lipped on whether households can expect a reprieve until its spring statement in late March. But elsewhere in Europe, multibillion-euro deals are already offering households the reassurance that bill payers in Great Britain are hoping for. The Netherlands, like the UK, is highly reliant on gas for electricity generation and home heating. Unlike the UK, its government took action within weeks of energy markets reaching record highs to provide a multibillion-euro package of measures to protect households and small businesses. The Dutch cabinet agreed in October to cut energy taxes in order to save households an average of €400 (£332.79) a year. In addition, some €150m is being set aside to boost home insulation. A further €500m will be used to compensate small firms in the form of lower energy taxes. The measures, which will cost a total of €3.2bn, took effect from 1 January and will run for a year. The French government also wasted no time in agreeing a package of measures to soften the blow of rising energy bills, after an increase in fuel duty in 2018 triggered widespread outcry over the cost of living and led to protests by the gilets jaunes (yellow vests). The French government has already cut some electricity taxes to help slow the rise in home energy bills at an estimated cost to the state of €8bn. It will also use its powers to squeeze the state-owned electricity company EDF to lower the cost of electricity by charging well below the market rate for the electricity it generates. EDF warned its investors that it would take an estimated €8.4bn (£7bn) financial hit from the plan. In Germany, the government plans to lower energy bills by reducing the cost of supporting renewable energy projects. From this year, the German government will cut a green surcharge that appears on home energy bills from 6.5 cents per kilowatt-hour to 3.7 cents. The government plans to cover the outstanding levies by using €3.3bn collected by the treasury via carbon taxes. The state has also offered a €130m package of one-time grants to low-income households, which will be paid over the summer when households receive their bills from energy suppliers. Spain’s government was one of the first to take action to protect households against a sharp rise in energy bills. It agreed last September to remove taxes from home energy bills until May, which would instead be paid by enforcing a windfall tax on utilities that were poised to profit from soaring energy market prices. The windfall tax is expected to raise about €2bn to soften the blow on households, and prevent Spain’s gas producers and electricity generators from raking in “unacceptable” profits during the crisis. The policy was seized upon by the UK Labour party as a model that could be applied to North Sea oil and gas producers. Italian households pay some of the highest energy bills in Europe and can expect one of the steepest increases in energy bills because of the global gas crisis. In response, the Italian government has set out a plan to protect households against the rise in gas prices. This includes cutting tax on gas for all consumers and reducing charges that finance subsidies for renewable energy, in addition to extra grants for low-income families. Overall, state support for struggling households is expected to reach €8.5bn through March this year. In Sweden, the government has set aside 6 billion kronor (£473m) to soften the impact of soaring electricity markets on home energy bills. Earlier this month, it announced plans for winter-bill subsidies of up to 6,000 kronor from December to February to about 1.8 million households whose power consumption tops 2,000 kilowatt-hours a month. Norway’s government set out a series of measures to help bill payers totalling more than 8 billion kroner (£664m) in December, mainly consisting of direct subsidies for households. Earlier this month, the Norwegian government promised to tackle the “socially unjust” effect of soaring energy bills by covering 80% of electricity costs when the market price for electricity is above 70 Norwegian øre (6p) per kilowatt-hour from January to March. The Danish government remains in talks to decide how much support it can offer towards household bills. So far it has set aside 100 million kroner (£11.1m) to top up an existing scheme that aims to help vulnerable households. But the government is preparing to take action to help households most exposed to the global gas crisis: those who rely on gas heating or gas-fuelled district heating networks. Approximately 800,000 households could receive a tax-free cheque from the government to help pay their energy bills. The exact amount has not yet been agreed by Denmark’s parliament.",News/Business,"As UK households feel pressure, how are other European countries tackling energy crisis?",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/31/as-uk-households-feel-pressure-how-are-other-european-countries-tackling-energy-crisis

It is also a quick and easy way to gauge the quality of a night’s observing conditions whenever the constellation of Taurus, the bull, is visible.  It involves counting the number of stars in the Pleiades. One of only a handful of star clusters visible to the naked eye, the Pleiades is particularly special because we can resolve some of the stars that makes it up. Another name for the cluster is the seven sisters – but that doesn’t necessarily mean that you can see seven stars. The chart shows the Pleiades’ location, above the shoulder of Taurus, with Alcyone the brightest star in the cluster. Even a casual observer should be able to see five stars from a reasonably dark site. It takes a little effort and patience to see more. On good nights, when conditions are clear and the air is still, up to five more members of the central cluster can be glimpsed. Advanced observers can also find online charts to start hunting the fainter, outlying members of the cluster.

1/31/2022,"Tilting menus towards plant-based meals significantly cuts the amount of meat eaten, according to new research. The experiments in work and university cafeterias showed making it easier to choose meat-free food can be effective and could be a more acceptable approach than other proposals, such as taxing meat or banning it on certain days.  Meat production is an important driver of the climate crisis and red meat in particular is linked to heart disease and other illnesses. Substantial falls in meat consumption are needed in rich nations to curb global heating and ill health. The new research, published in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, involved three separate experiments, including the first scientific online study of plant-based menu choices. This used a representative sample of 2,200 UK adults and found that when three of four meal options were meat-based, 12% chose the plant-based option. But when three of four meal options were vegetarian, 48% chose the vegetarian meal. The effect was the same whether the participants were female or male, rich or poor. A similar result was found in an Oxford University cafeteria, which had chosen to switch from a mostly meat-based menu to one that was mostly plant-based. No change was seen in other university cafes during the study, although meat consumption is falling in the UK, by 17% in the last decade. The third experiment was in workplace cafeterias, including warehouses and factories. Sales data showed a 5% swing to plant-based meals in 10 sites, although the analysis was more complicated as the menus varied between the sites. “There is an urgent need to promote more sustainable consumption to protect planetary [and human] health,” said Rachel Pechey, at the University of Oxford, who led the study. “Changing the availability of meat-free options may be a promising intervention. People have quite a strong reaction to any policies targeting meat, and everyone always hates taxes.” “We don’t want to be telling anyone what to do,” she said. “But we know that how our environment is shaped helps influence our decisions, so it can make more sustainable choices an easier choice for people.” Tim Lord, at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, said changes at the level suggested by the study could – if replicated across society – deliver the 20% cut in meat-eating that the UK’s Climate Change Committee says is needed by 2035. “By foregrounding the low-carbon choice it is possible to drive significant change while allowing those who want to select a higher carbon option the ability to do so,” he said. “It also illustrates a broader point about behaviour change and net zero, namely that making it easy for consumers is crucial. This is as true of home decarbonisation as it is of diet – at present, getting a heat pump is a lot harder than getting a gas boiler.” In October, the government published a study on how behaviour change can reduce meat eating and flying but withdrew it within a few hours, saying “we have no plans whatsoever to dictate consumer behaviour”. Other studies have found that simple environmental messages on menus can double plant-based choices, as can placing these options higher up menus and describing them in ways that highlight their flavour, rather than the lack of meat. Pechey and her colleagues are now examining the impact of labelling the green footprint of meals on menus. Pechey said: “There are strong social and cultural norms around meat-eating, and people do tend to over-choose the meat options. If you’ve just got one vegetarian option on your menu, that could be perceived as the dish choice just for the vegetarians. But if you start having more options, it might start giving the idea that these options are in demand and things that other people choose.” A government-commissioned food strategy published in 2021 called for big cuts in meat consumption, while a powerful coalition of the UK’s health professions called in 2020 for a climate tax on food with a heavy environmental impact by 2025, unless the industry had taken voluntary action on the impact of its products.",News/Environment,"Tilting menus towards plants cuts meat eating, study shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/31/tilting-menus-towards-plants-cuts-meat-eating-study-shows
1/31/2022,"The coming weeks are decisive for the Conservatives – not just because of the frustrating wait for Sue Gray’s report on Downing Street parties. As we head towards a spring of tax hikes and soaring prices, the prime minister and chancellor will come to a major crossroads in the cost of living crisis.  The truth is it couldn’t be a worse time for a government to be paralysed by its own drama. For months, inflation has spiralled out of control. The cost of a weekly food shop is up. Gas and electricity bills are skyrocketing. Everyone is noticing the difference. The government’s answer? Painfully whacking up national insurance contributions for working people and businesses. To know how to fix this, you have to look at why we’re here. It’s partly down to disruption and extra red tape from the government’s patchwork Brexit deal, one that’s left businesses, workers and consumers facing shortages, delays and higher prices. But it’s not just over the last year that Tory failures have taken hold. It’s over the last decade. Their incompetence and inability to plan over the last 11 years for shocks such as the global gas crisis have left us uniquely exposed, a reason many other countries are faring better than us. It’s why last week the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast that the UK will grow at half the rate as the advanced economy average over this parliament. The Conservative failure to regulate the energy market, their decision to close gas storage, their achingly slow progress on renewables, nuclear and insulating homes has left bills mounting to unbelievable levels. There is much that could give immediate relief from this – measures Labour has called for over many months. By cutting VAT on home energy bills and spreading some of the costs from suppliers gone bust, you can save most households across the country £200 off their bills. With the Resolution Foundation saying that the average household will feel a hit of £1,200 in April, many will benefit from that. But as fuel poverty rises, lower earners and pensioners will be hit especially hard. That’s why Labour would target extra support to those who need it most, giving those households an extra £400 – that’s £600 off bills in total – enough to cancel out the total expected energy price rise in April. We’d pay for all this with a one-off windfall tax on the profits of North Sea oil and gas producers, who have made a fortune this year, as well as using higher than expected VAT receipts and North Sea oil and gas receipts to keep bills low. The government could provide that relief now. They could start insulating more homes and build more sustainable and secure energy supplies as Labour will do. But distraction and deceit seem worth far more of their time. They don’t have an answer to the cost of living crisis, because they are the cost of living crisis. If you don’t grow the economy as they haven’t, you get trapped in a cycle of high taxes to pay for public services weakened by 10 years of austerity. Not only Labour, but now Tory MPs aplenty and cabinet ministers themselves are calling on Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson to abandon the damaging national insurance rise. But the Conservatives are now a high tax party, because they have become a low growth party. To add insult to injury, at the very same moment the chancellor is knocking on working people’s doors for more, he’s casually writing off £4.3bn of taxpayer cash lost to fraudsters and organised criminals. There’s no map for economic recovery, no looking beyond the end of another Tory leadership race. To get out of this crisis, and to create a stronger economy, we must plan for the future. We’ve got to grasp the possibility of industry and innovation simmering across the UK, meet our potential and seize hold of tomorrow. Instead, we’re faced with a government out of ideas and out of energy, too worn out by its own games to do the hard work when it matters. Labour wants to tackle the cost of living crisis so people’s everyday economies thrive. We want to stop waste because we respect taxpayers and we respect our public services. That’s why the next Labour government will grab hold of the opportunities and tackle our challenges, to grow our economy, make it stronger and spread prosperity across the UK.

The England manager – alongside celebrities including Ross Kemp, Gary Lineker and Levi Roots – is aiming to encourage millions of people to take part in neighbourhood parties across the country in June celebrating community spirit and the Queen on what they have dubbed National Thank You Day.  It would need to surpass the 10 million party-goers who marked the Queen’s first 25 years on the throne in 1977 and similar numbers who celebrated the marriage of Charles and Diana in 1981 to stand a chance of entering the record books. The plan is backed by hundreds of organisations including the NHS, the Football Association, the Scouts, and the Church of England. Celebrity backers, also including Prue Leith, Alan Titchmarsh and Lorraine Kelly, will be raising the event’s profile in the runup to Sunday 5 June, the final day of the Queen’s official jubilee celebrations. Kemp, who made his name on the BBC soap EastEnders, said the day was an opportunity to thank each other as well as the Queen. “It’s our chance to say a great big thank you to the Queen for 70 years of service, but also to each other – the people in our own lives – families, streets and communities, who we rely on every day,” he said. “The people whose support we couldn’t do without.” He urged people to get together on the day in unprecedented numbers. “Make sure everyone is invited – rope in the neighbours, ask people from the next street over, get the local band to play.” Peter Stewart, executive director of the Eden Project and the Big Jubilee Lunch, said the day would bring people together. “There are more reasons than ever to get together this year and we’re really excited to be bringing the spirit of the jubilee into every neighbourhood with the Big Jubilee Lunch this June,” he said.

1/31/2022,"The typical delay between an offence of rape and the completion of the resulting criminal case rose to 1,000 days in 2021 for the first time, figures have revealed. The Ministry of Justice said the median time between offence and completion in rape cases was 1,020 days, or over two and a half years, in the first nine months of 2021, up by more than a quarter from the previous year.  The data, published in response to parliamentary questions from the shadow attorney general, Emily Thornberry, also showed that 576 rape cases had been waiting for more than a year to come to court as of the end of September 2021, well over double the average of the previous five years. It come just days after Home Office data revealed sharp drops in prosecution and conviction rates for rape, with only 1.3% of cases now being prosecuted. Thornberry said the delays were “sickening and unacceptable”. “These figures show that waits of more than 1,000 days have become the norm for survivors of rape. Every day of delay puts trials at risk, threatening to rob survivors of the justice they deserve, and prolonging the trauma they are made to endure,” she said. “Any government with an ounce of compassion would set about fixing these record delays as a priority, not letting them grow worse by the year.” Extreme delays in a number of rape cases made the overall average delay even longer, with the mean time between offence and completion standing at 2,767 days in the first nine months of 2021 – more than seven and a half years – close to the record of 2,910 reached in 2019. Jo Sidhu QC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, said: “Five years or more for a complainant to finally see a trial conclude is rapidly becoming the norm not the exception as these serious cases go to the back of a queue in a system starved of criminal barristers. “The painful irony for rape victims is last year half the number of rape complaints were prosecuted than seven years ago, but they took on average twice as long to conclude.”Criminal Bar Association analysis showed there were over 6,400 outstanding sexual offence trials as of 30 September 2021, a 125% rise in three years. “Rape trials are only going to get longer unless government puts the resources in place to ensure we have enough prosecutors and defenders to tackle the backlogs,” Sidhu said. In October, Boris Johnson said there were “delays taking place at every stage in the process” in cases such as rape and domestic violence, and cited complexities in gathering evidence as one of the reasons. Admitting that rape victims in Britain were being badly served, he promised to “stop at nothing to make sure we get more rapists behind bars”. Labour has said it would end delays by increasing the number of rape and serious sexual assault offence (Rasso) units in the Crown Prosecution Service and rolling out new Nightingale courts to guarantee an additional 33,000 sitting days. A government spokesperson said: “We are overhauling our entire response to rape and boosting funding for support services to £185m.

1/31/2022,"Rishi Sunak is being urged by a leading centre-right thinktank to limit the impact of April’s controversial £12bn increase in national insurance contributions by shifting the burden of tax from work to wealth. Highlighting disquiet in Tory ranks over the looming national insurance rise, a report from Bright Blue has called for higher taxes on capital, inheritance and rents as a way of making the system fairer.  The thinktank, set up to promote liberal conservatism, also said people who worked on after they reach the state pension age should pay national insurance rather than being exempt. The report said Sunak’s new health and social care levy – designed to raise money to clear NHS backlogs and increase spending on care – was “surprising” for a Conservative government to bring in and the priority should be to make it less burdensome for employers. “It cannot be abolished but it can be made much fairer. Any detrimental impact on workers and employers can be mitigated,” the report added. Sunak and Boris Johnson have insisted in a joint Sunday Times article that the national insurance increase will go ahead in April as planned. But the Labour party, a significant number of Tory MPs and business groups have all expressed strong opposition to what they see as a tax on jobs. The Institute of Directors has warned the 1.25% increase – payable by both employers and employees – will drive up the UK’s already soaring inflation rate by adding to costs. Bright Blue said the Treasury should not pass up the opportunity to recalibrate the tax system so that it better rewarded work and recognised the impact wealth and inheritance was having on life outcomes. Sunak could mitigate the impact of the NI increase and reform the tax system by a series of measures, including: Broadening the health and social care levy to apply to pensioner and rental income. Ending the exemption from paying national insurance contributions for those working on beyond the state pension age, currently 66. Narrowing the gap between the headline rate of capital gains tax and Income tax by creating two main rates for all capital gains of 18% at the basic rate and 28% at the higher rate. Replacing inheritance tax with a lifetime receipts tax, which would have a starting lifetime allowance of £125,700. Ryan Shorthouse, Bright Blue’s chief executive and a co-author of the report, said: “A centre-right government that is committed to levelling up the UK should rebalance the tax system from income associated with work and effort and on to income associated with privilege and luck.” The report was commissioned by Bright Blue’s cross-party tax commission, which includes the Labour MP Margaret Hodge, the former chair of the House of Commons public accounts committee, and the former Conservative universities minister David Willetts. Hodge said: “The government’s new levy on national insurance contributions is one of the least equitable options for raising the necessary resources. While I would advocate for even more radical reform, these new recommendations will rightly open up debate on how we could fairly taxing income from wealth as well as work.” Willetts said the government needed to get the right balance between different forms of taxation. “We may be taxing earnings too heavily relative to assets, whose value has surged.”",Lifestyle/Money,Rishi Sunak urged to shift burden of tax from work to wealth,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/31/rishi-sunak-urged-to-shift-burden-of-tax-from-work-to-wealth
1/31/2022,"One minute, it’s a shish kebab. The next, it’s a washing machine. A second later, it’s a casserole. Speaking to Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara about their new building, the metaphors come tumbling out in a passionate torrent. The two Irish architects, whose practice Grafton won worldwide recognition in 2020 when it won the prestigious Pritzker prize, can’t contain their excitement about their £145m facility for the London School of Economics, partly because they haven’t had a chance to visit it yet. “The pandemic has really made us understand the meaning of longing,” says Farrell. “Site visits on FaceTime just aren’t the same.” The longing is over for students and academics, though, who return to face-to-face teaching this term, in a place that truly brings home the benefits of meeting in the real world. The new Marshall Building, which looks out over Lincoln’s Inn Fields like a gleaming white palazzo, houses some of the finest spaces that any London university has to offer.  The project is the latest addition to the LSE’s impressive stable of recent commissions, shoehorned into a five-acre tangle of alleyways behind Aldwych in central London. There is the twisted redbrick ziggurat of the student centre, designed by fellow Dublin duo O’Donnell + Tuomey in 2014, which boasts a helter-skelter of alluring nooks and crannies. Then came the glacial slab of the Centre Building in 2018, by Richard Rogers’ firm RSHP, a hi-tech silo of open-plan floors linked by meandering stairs. And, for a final prime site nearby, there is yet another international competition under way, this time for £120m. But the Marshall Building is first time the LSE has had the chance to present a public face to Lincoln’s Inn Fields, the largest public square in London and one of its oldest, having been laid out in the 1630s. And what an entrance it is. Channelled through a cleft in the Portland stone facade, you arrive inside an expansive hall, where gigantic concrete trees, the kind that might support a flyover, branch out in big brawny wedges. One punches through a hole in the ceiling, continuing its structural journey to the floors above, while a broad spiral staircase licks down in an elegant curl, enticing you up. If you start to feel woozy from all this heroic concrete gymnastics, it might also be because the floor itself is sloping. This is a practical solution to the one-metre level difference across the site, avoiding the need for steps, but it also adds to the sense of being irresistibly drawn into the great hall, conceived as a covered public piazza. Anyone can wander in off the street and sip a coffee beneath the leaping beams. The terrazzo-paved square will be used for graduation ceremonies and can be transformed into an atmospheric banqueting hall. There is a good reason for the infrastructural muscle – and it’s not just the architects’ love of Brazilian brutalism. Below the ground floor lies a vast sports hall, along with a gym, squash courts, dance studio and music rooms, repurposing a pre-existing triple-height basement, left over from the former 1960s Imperial Cancer Research Fund labs that occupied the site. The sports hall required a column-free expanse, which would usually necessitate hefty beams or a massive truss to transfer the weight of the nine storeys above on to the existing basement retaining walls. Working with engineers, AKT II, the team came up with a clever solution, conceiving the transfer structure as a space that could be inhabited. And so the concrete tree-studded great hall was born, with the great wedge-shaped beams tapering towards the centre where they support the column grid above. Inspiration also came from an unlikely source nearby: the 17th-century Lincoln’s Inn Chapel. The building is raised up on great stone vaults that fan out, creating an open ground floor below massive masonry ribs. “We loved the idea of going upstairs to this other world,” says McNamara, “from a public space below.” In their building, the spiral stair sweeps up to the two teaching floors, where Harvard-style horseshoe lecture theatres and classrooms are arranged around the edges in curved timber-clad pods, each enjoying daylight and a view out. The space in between is given over to informal seating – shaped, Farrell says, by “tidal lines of students and professors bumping into one another”. It is the kind of place you might want to actually sit and work, rather than just another anonymous corridor filing you from one seminar to the next. Little terraces, cut into the facade, allow a gulp of fresh air and a view of the square between classes. The departments of accounting, finance and management are stacked above, connected by a light-well (the “shish kebab”) supported by another branching tree. Researchers’ offices are arranged along corridors that radiate from the centre like a sundial, with meeting rooms located at the “social fulcrum” of the stairs, in the hope of sparking encounters. “Architects always think that open studios are the best way to work,” says McNamara. “But researchers are like monks. They like to retreat into a cell where they are completely private, then come out and have the contrast in the more public spaces.” Farrell rhapsodises a day in the life of this “vortex of thinking”, where an academic might pop downstairs from their office for a game of squash, or come down for a coffee, only to be lured into a music recital, the sounds of Rachmaninov inspiring a breakthrough in their systemic risk modelling. “It’s about convening in a casserole of delight,” she says. “Not silent corridors with ‘Shh!’ signs everywhere.” The noise of this lively casserole shouldn’t travel too far upstairs, thanks to carpeted floors and absorbent materials hidden in walls. The sheer volume of concrete on show will raise environmental eyebrows, but Grafton insists it can be sustainable. “People say we are just brutalists from Dublin throwing concrete all over the place,” says McNamara, citing the reaction in some quarters when their building for Kingston University won the Stirling prize last year. “It’s cement that’s the dirty word, not concrete, and we’ve worked hard to replace as much of the cement content as possible.” Gerry O’Brien of AKT II says their embodied carbon assessment of the whole building came out at 650kg of CO2 equivalent per square metre. This works out at almost 12,000 tonnes, which sounds enormous but comes in under RIBA’s new 2030 targets (despite the building having been designed in 2016, when targets were much looser). While the inside revels in its sheer concrete muscle, with interiors worthy of the Brazilian architect Paulo Mendes da Rocha, the exterior is more deferential to the tastes of Westminster planners. To fit in with its decorous neighbours, the Lincoln’s Inn Fields elevation takes a classical tripartite form, with a solid stone plinth at the lower storeys and two successive layers of white concrete fins, neatly angled in different directions. “We were concerned that north-facing facades can be very hostile, cold and dreary,” says McNamara. “We wanted to capture as much light as possible from the sides, to animate this facade and draw reflected daylight inside.” It’s a worthy intention, but the result feels a bit stiff, as if the chiselled forms behind have been masked with a prissy veil. Things get more interesting around the back, where the blocky mass of the building is cut and prised open in different directions, responding to the jumbled streetscape, with terraces and ledges. For Julian Robinson, the LSE’s director of estates, a major victory was convincing the council to pedestrianise one of these streets, on to which a long stone bench now fronts, and where large windows can be fully opened in summer. A curious little building remains clinging to the corner, like a pebble at the foot of a glacier. This is The Old Curiosity Shop, a Victorian fake named to lure Dickens tourists. The LSE bought it during construction and might open it as a Dickensian tea shop. The thing that helped to summon this great concrete iceberg into being can be found at its very summit. Occupying the penthouse belvedere, with its own panoramic terrace, is the Marshall Institute, a research centre for philanthropy and social entrepreneurship named after Sir Paul Marshall, boss of the £40bn hedge fund Marshall Wace. A prominent donor to the Brexit campaign, and backer of GB News, Marshall contributed £10m to found the institute in 2015, along with £20m towards the building, providing a further £50m last year. “It’s really our showcase floor,” says Robinson. “High net worth individuals will be brought up here to look out across the city where they’ve made their money – and hopefully be persuaded to part with some of it.” The spell cast by Grafton’s architecture, as light bounces between the crisp concrete blades, casting a golden glow across this rooftop eyrie, might well make them cough up.",Arts/Art and design,"‘A vortex of thinking’ – inside the LSE’s brawny, brainy new building",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/31/vortex-of-thinking-lses-brawny-brainy-new-building-curiosity-shop
1/31/2022,"More than 30 years since the Fitzgerald Inquiry exposed widespread graft and misconduct in Queensland, the state has again turned to Tony Fitzgerald to run an inquiry into its under-fire corruption watchdog, the Crime and Corruption Commission. In the past week, Annastacia Palaszczuk’s government has come under increasing pressure to agree to an inquiry as accusations emerged of an “integrity crisis” caused by a series of apparently unrelated events – the resignation of the Queensland integrity commissioner amid concerns about interference with her office; the resignation of CCC chair Alan MacSporran; and criticism by the former state archivist about political interference. The LNP opposition had called for “Fitzgerald 2.0”.  A commission of inquiry into the CCC had been a recommendation of its parliamentary oversight body, after hearings into the CCC’s handling of abandoned charges against eight Logan councillors found it had breached its duty to remain independent and impartial. Some in the local government sector have subsequently claimed the CCC is “out of control” and should be shorn of powers. The premier said on Monday that cabinet had agreed to an inquiry into the CCC and had turned to the one person, above all others, who could bring the process serious credibility. Fitzgerald, 80, will chair the inquiry alongside retired supreme court judge Alan Wilson. Palaszczuk said she admired Fitzgerald for the way his 1980s inquiry, which exposed corruption during the latter years of National party government, had shaped modern Queensland. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The former premier, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, resigned amid Fitzgerald’s initial inquiry. Three former National party ministers and the police commissioner, Terry Lewis, were jailed as a result. Lewis was also stripped of his knighthood. More than 30 years on, the inquiry is still the major touchstone on corruption issues. “It is clear a review of the CCC is needed,” Palaszczuk said. “Who better than Tony Fitzgerald to conduct it?” “No one can argue about Tony Fitzgerald’s independence. To do its job, the public must have absolute confidence in the CCC and this commission of inquiry.” Among the matters that Fitzgerald and Wilson will investigate is the role of seconded police officers to the CCC; something that had been of concern prior to more recent events. Opposition leader David Crisafulli said the inquiry should be more wide-ranging than simply the CCC. “Queenslanders are smarter than this and won’t have the wool pulled over their eyes,” he said. “Anything short of a full royal commission into the widespread systemic integrity issues ripping through the Queensland Government is a cop out.” “Attempts to hose down the CCC bin fire completely ignores the integrity inferno burning through the heart of the government. The state government’s integrity crisis is so much bigger than the announcement we have seen today.”",News/Australia news,Annastacia Palaszczuk taps Tony Fitzgerald to head inquiry into Queensland corruption watchdog,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/31/annastacia-palaszczuk-taps-tony-fitzgerald-to-head-inquiry-into-queensland-corruption-watchdog

1/31/2022,"The West Dipton Burn cleaves a deep, snaking ravine through the land south of Hexham. One of several streams that feed into the Devil’s Water – a tributary of the Tyne – its precipitous sides are thickly wooded. It is to this woodland area that we are heading. To reach it via the valley bottom is difficult. The cliffs close in the higher up you go, and crossing the many fords is only possible when the water level is low. So we enter the woods from the top end, using a path that runs along the upper rim and hugs the drystone wall. Emerald hummocks of moss cushion the thruffs – the through stones that bind the wall. Down below, the sheltered dene is starting to wake up: the chink-chink of chaffinches, the busy trills of blue tits, the squeaky sawing of great tits.  After the airy openness of silver birches, the wood gradually becomes denser with dark shiny-leaved hollies, coppiced hazels and sessile oaks. Storm Arwen has left its mark: across the path a sycamore has torn down the wall with its muddy flailing root ball; huge limbs of oaks have fallen; a birch bracketed with polypore fungus lies tumbled in a heap. From below comes the sound of the burn, and somewhere on the southern wall of the gorge is the well-hidden Queen’s Cave. The story tells of Queen Margaret of Anjou, wife of King Henry VI, being sheltered there by an outlaw after the brief but bloody Battle of Hexham in 1464 and the defeat of the Lancastrian army. Margaret was in fact nowhere near at the time, but the Victorian historical writer Agnes Strickland wrote imaginatively: “Taking the prince in his arms, [the outlaw] led the queen to his own retreat, a cave in Hexham forest, where the royal fugitives were refreshed.” No sun penetrates the shadowy ravine. We stick to the upper path, where light filters through the red trunks of Scots pines and fires the peeling bark of birches like alabaster. A frantic squabble of jays screech overhead and a wren twitches its way through emerging leaves of honeysuckle. The wren, Troglodytes troglodytes, the cave dweller, will soon be looking for its own secret place in the wood.
