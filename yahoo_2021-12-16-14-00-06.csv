12/16/2021,"Donald Trump has endorsed controversial Colorado lawmaker Lauren Boebert for re-election. Trump's endorsement comes less than 24 hours after the House passed a bill to combat Islamophobia. The bill was a tacit rebuke of Boebert's Islamophobic comments, where she insinuated that Rep. Ilhan Omar is a terrorist. Former President Donald Trump has given a glowing endorsement of controversial Colorado congresswoman Lauren Boebert. Trump's endorsement of Boebert was announced on Twitter via his spokeswoman Liz Harrington. ""Congresswoman Lauren Boebert has done a fantastic job in her first term representing Colorado's Third District. She is a fearless leader, a defender of the America First Agenda, and a fighter against the Loser RINOs and Radical Democrats,"" Trump wrote in his endorsement. ""She will continue to be tough on Crime, strong on Borders, and always protect our under-siege Second Amendment. Lauren has my Complete and Total Endorsement for her reelection!"" Trump added. Boebert responded to Trump's endorsement, tweeting: ""I am beyond humbled & honored to receive the endorsement of President Donald J. Trump! I will ALWAYS stand with the America First agenda & President Trump! Join our campaign today by chipping in $20.22."" Trump's endorsement of Boebert for the upcoming mid-term elections came a day after the House narrowly passed a bill to combat Islamophobia. The ""Combating International Islamophobia Act,"" which passed on Tuesday, was an implicit rebuke of Boebert for Islamophobic comments she made about the bill's sponsor, Rep. Ilhan Omar. In November, a video of Boebert making Islamophobic comments about Omar went viral. In the video, Boebert described running into Omar in an elevator and referred to her as part of a ""Jihad Squad,"" insinuating that Omar is a terrorist. Omar denied the elevator incident ever happened and called Boebert a ""buffoon,"" saying the far-right Colorado congresswoman ""looks down when she sees me at the Capitol."" ""This whole story is made up. Sad she thinks bigotry gets her clout,"" Omar continued. ""Anti-Muslim bigotry isn't funny & shouldn't be normalized. Congress can't be a place where hateful and dangerous Muslims tropes get no condemnation."" Boebert later apologized on Twitter, saying: ""I apologize to anyone in the Muslim community I offended with my comment about Rep. Omar,"" she wrote. ""I have reached out to her office to speak with her directly."" Omar said later, however, that her phone call with Boebert had been ""unproductive"" and that Boebert had ""doubled down on her rhetoric."" The controversy swirling around Boebert led Democratic caucus chairs and progressive Democratic House members to call for Boebert to face consequences for her anti-Muslim rhetoric and be stripped of her committee assignments. However, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has signaled that House Republicans would not take action against Boebert. Trump has, for his part, also spread baseless conspiracy theories that Omar married her brother and abandoned Somalia when she fled as a child. Omar has called the rumors ""absurd and offensive"" and released a lengthy statement and timeline of her marriage history in 2016. Boebert is currently facing Republican Marina Zimmerman in the primary for her seat. Zimmerman tweeted in November that she wanted to ""take out the trash"" when calling on voters to support her over Boebert. Zimmerman describes herself on her campaign website as a ""hard-working, get-it-done Conservative,"" appealing to voters who want to ""restore sensibility, civility, and ethics in Congress.""

12/16/2021,"The National Archives and Records Administration released 1,500 secret documents related to John F. Kennedy’s assassination Wednesday. The 1963 killing shocked the nation and continues to arouse fascination in historians and conspiracy theorists alike. The National Archives’ document dump was slated to come a year ago, but President Joe Biden delayed it, blaming the coronavirus pandemic. Another launch date was scrapped a month ago. Some files, originally promised to be released with those that came out Wednesday, will be withheld until December 2022. Congress mandated that all the Warren Commission documents be made public by 2017 in 1992. According to the National Archives, more than 90 percent of the records relating to the assassination have been released. Though these documents may not reconfigure the assassination in the American imagination, here are some of the juiciest bits from the once-hidden cables. Oliver Stone Yet Again Makes the Case That the CIA Killed JFK JFK’s assassin, former Marine Lee Harvey Oswald, met with a KGB agent in Mexico City only a couple months before he killed the president, according to a CIA memo. “According to an intercepted phone call in Mexico City, Lee Oswald was in the Soviet Embassy there on 23 September and spoke with Consul Valeriy Vladimirovich,” the memo reads. Oswald would call the same Soviet embassy a week later, identifying himself by name in broken Russian, CIA officers wrote. “Hello, this [is] Lee Oswald speaking,” he said to the USSR diplomat who answered the phone. “I was at your place last Saturday and spoke to a consul, and they said that they’d send a telegram to Washington, so I wanted to find out if you anything new. But I don’t remember the name of that consul.” According to the transcript of the call, Valery Kostikov, a KGB officer, told Oswald, “They say that they haven’t received anything yet.” “Have they done anything?” asked Oswald. “Yes, they say that a request has been sent out, but nothing has been received yet,” said Kostikov. Then he hung up. Oswald drove back into the U.S. via the Texas-Mexico border in October 1963. A person phoned the U.S. embassy in Australia a year before Kennedy’s assassination, warning that the Soviets would pay $100,000 for it. The CIA never received word of the tip, the New York Post reports. One 1964 State Department memo read, “Cabled to Canberra asking full details of the telephone conversation of 23 November and the call made 15 October 1962. It should be noted that CIA had not previously known of the 1962 telephone call.” Two days after the assassination, another person called about the possibility of the Soviets financing the hit on Kennedy, this time phoning a U.S. Navy attache, according to CIA cables. The man identified himself as Polish and a driver for the Soviet embassy in Canberra, and CIA agents believed he was the same person who called a year earlier. But, CIA officers wrote, “In the opinion of the Australian authorities, the caller was a crank,” and Australian intelligence was unable to identify a Polish employee of the Russian embassy there. U.S. intelligence officers pursued a line of inquiry that involved Oswald visiting the Cuban consulate in Mexico City to plot with the Cubans. A Mexican employee of the Cuban embassy in Mexico City arrested by Mexican authorities said Oswald “professed to be a Communist and an admirer of Castro.” That theory was later disproved when a Nicaraguan man confessed he had fabricated seeing Oswald at the embassy in order to “involve the United States in a way which would result in the overthrow of Castro,” according to a cable to the Secretary of State. The CIA also theorized that an Associated Press interview may have influenced Oswald. While the assassin was living in New Orleans, a local newspaper published an interview with Fidel Castro in which the Communist leader warned the U.S. against aggression against Cuba and assassination of its officials, promising retribution. Another CIA document, this one marked “Secret Eyes Only,” outlines the agency’s own schemes to assassinate Fidel Castro, which “involved the use of the criminal underworld with contacts inside Cuba,” the AP reports.

12/16/2021,"MANILA (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from coastal areas of the central and southern Philippines ahead of a strong typhoon that is expected to make landfall on Thursday afternoon. Typhoon Rai, which has been upgraded to a category 4 storm, the second-highest classification, has wind speeds of 165 km (102.5 miles) per hour, with gusts of up to 205 kph, the Philippines' weather bureau said.
