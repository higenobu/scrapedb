2/3/2022,"New Zealand has announced it will reopen its border to visitors in stages, starting at the end of February, after its earlier plans to do so were derailed by Omicron. It will be the first time the country has opened up since prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced its snap closure in the first month of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The country’s borders have been closed, apart from a short-lived travel bubble with Australia, for nearly two years. “With Omicron’s arrival, we pushed that change in border settings out – to give ourselves the chance to roll out boosters – a chance most other countries never had,” Ardern said in a speech on Thursday.  “With our community better protected we must turn to the importance of reconnection. Families and friends need to reunite. Our businesses need skills to grow. Exporters need to travel to make new connections.” The border will initially open to vaccinated New Zealand citizens and visa holders coming from Australia, then from the rest of the world, and finally to all other vaccinated visitors. They will still have to self-isolate at home for 10 days, but will no longer have to pass through the country’s expensive and highly space-limited managed isolation facilities, known as MIQ. “It’s easy to hear the word MIQ and immediately associate it with heartache. There is no question that, for New Zealand, it has been one of the hardest parts of the pandemic. But the reason that it is right up there as one of the toughest things we have experienced, is in part because large-scale loss of life is not,” Ardern said. Fully vaccinated New Zealanders and other eligible travellers from Australia will be able to enter New Zealand without staying in MIQ from Sunday 27 February. Two weeks later, they can come from all other countries. Critical workers and skilled workers will be eligible to enter New Zealand from this date. The working holiday scheme will also resume. Ardern said the two-week gap will enable public health systems to adjust for the likelihood of more cases in the community, and will allow the border systems to “keep scaling up in the safest way possible”. From 12 April, 5,000 international students and other eligible temporary visa holders will be allowed to enter. After that, the border opens to Australians and other travellers who do not require a visa to enter New Zealand. “This stage is likely to begin when we have much larger case numbers than we have now. For planning, we anticipate this stage will begin no later than July. I want to place strong emphasis on this being the latest we expect this to begin,” Ardern said. All other international visitors will be allowed to enter New Zealand from October. The self-isolation period will align with New Zealand’s current system for managing close contacts of cases. As the isolation period drops for close contacts, so too will returnees only need to isolate for seven days. Anyone entering will be given three rapid antigen tests to take home. All non-vaccinated travellers and other high-risk travellers will still be required to enter MIQ.",News/World news,Jacinda Ardern announces New Zealand border will open in stages from end of February,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/jacinda-ardern-announces-new-zealand-border-will-open-in-stages-from-end-of-february
2/3/2022,"The cost of rehabilitating a decommissioned uranium mine in Kakadu national park could blow out by $1.2bn, in what is becoming the single largest repair exercise in the history of Australian mining. Former uranium miner Energy Resources of Australia shut down the mine last January and since then has been racing against the clock to complete the work before the 2026 deadline.  ERA severely underestimated the cost of rehabilitation, initially putting a $973m price tag on the project. But on Wednesday the company announced it would cost between $1.6bn and $2.2bn to repair the mine site. Mirarr senior traditional owner Yvonne Margarula welcomed greater certainty of the true cost of Ranger’s clean-up. “Ranger has operated on our country for over 40 years. I have been waiting for this nearly all my life,” Margarula said. “ERA and Rio Tinto promise me that everything will be cleaned up properly, but I am worried that the government has forgotten that it put this mine here in the first place. “This is going to cost someone a lot more money now and we need to know the government has not forgotten its promises to Aboriginal people.” The timing of the project has also blown out, as ERA announced the project would now take until 2028 – two years longer than it is legally allowed. ERA’s lease stipulates it must complete the clean-up by 2026, a condition that is backed by the Atomic Energy Act 1953. In a statement to the ASX the company said it would work with the government to try to change the legislation – a proposal that has the support of The Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation, which represents the traditional owners. “ERA has been engaging with government and key stakeholders to amend the [Act] and extend the expiry date of ERA’s tenure on the Ranger Project Area,” the statement said. In light of the blowout, ERA said it was “currently reviewing all available funding options to ensure that the increased forecast cost of the rehabilitation of the Ranger Project Area will be adequately funded.” In a statement ERA’s parent company, Rio Tinto, said it is “committed to working with [ERA] to ensure the rehabilitation of the Ranger Project Area is successfully achieved to a standard that will establish an environment similar to the adjacent Kakadu national park”. CEO of GAC, Justin O’Brien, said the Australian government must now expedite passage of legislative amendments to provide ERA with continued access to the Ranger site beyond January 2026. “Not enough has been done to fix the unrealistic schedule set by federal legislation for rehabilitation. “We refused to support ministerial approval of the 2020 version Ranger Mine Closure Plan for this reason. In 2021, ERA failed to meet its first deadline in Jabiru, causing an avoidable housing shortage with which the local community continues to struggle. “We cannot have a repeat of that with Ranger.” O’Brien added the announcement is a realistic acknowledgment that the era of uranium mining at Kakadu national park is at an end. “With all mining ceased at Kakadu forever, the world is now watching Australia to see if rehabilitation can be successfully secured,” O’Brien said.",News/Australia news,Cost to rehabilitate Kakadu uranium mine site could blow out by $1.2bn,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/03/cost-to-rehabilitate-kakadu-uranium-mine-site-could-blow-out-by-12bn
2/3/2022,"Tom Curry has emerged as a leading contender to be named England captain on Thursday and been given a ringing endorsement by the Sale director of rugby, Alex Sanderson, to solve Eddie Jones’s leadership crisis against Scotland. At 23 years old Curry would be England’s youngest captain since Will Carling but he has long since been earmarked for the role and, with both Owen Farrell and Courtney Lawes out with injury, he has been widely tipped to lead the side.  Curry has assumed the responsibility in recent matches when neither Farrell nor Lawes have been on the field and though Jones has delayed naming a replacement until two days before England’s Six Nations opener against Scotland at Murrayfield, Sanderson says the Sale back-rower is ready to make the step up. Curry was on Wednesday among a group of England players to put the Duchess of Cambridge through her paces at Twickenham following the announcement she would be taking over as the Rugby Football Union’s patron. She was greeted by Lawes – a strong sign he will assume the captaincy when he is fit – while other options for Saturday include Ellis Genge, Maro Itoje and Luke Cowan‑Dickie. Jones has also named co-captains in the past and he and his coaches have stressed the need for players to share the responsibility in the absence of Farrell and Lawes. “It’s huge for Tom,” Sanderson said. “He has grown into that role and he seems to be relishing it, if he does get the captaincy. When he came back off the Lions [tour] there was talk about his leadership qualities and it was in the air then. “He is 23 years old with the potential and the mastery of the game that he has got this is one of those things; how can he get better? This is the one area in terms of leadership where he can make strides as he gets more experienced and this is the natural progression for him.” Jones was waiting on Wednesday night on the availability of Joe Marchant before finalising his rookie side as England seek only a second win in five matches against Scotland. Marchant, who tested positive for Covid-19 last week, is going through the isolation protocols and his test result on Thursday morning will be pivotal in determining availability. Without Marchant, England would be missing six of the side who beat South Africa in their last match when the 25-year-old excelled alongside Henry Slade in midfield. He had been earmarked to reprise that partnership but Elliot Daly is thought to have impressed upon his recall to the squad and could slot in at either centre – where Mark Atkinson is also an option – or wing while Jack Nowell, Max Malins and Ollie Hassell-Collins are also contenders for the wide positions. In the pack, Alex Dombrandt is hopeful of a first Six Nations start with Charlie Ewels, Nick Isiekwe and Ollie Chessum vying for a second-row spot. Perhaps Jones’s most crucial call, however, is whether to stick with Marcus Smith – the spearhead of his “New England” project – or turn to George Ford who is more suited to the conditions forecast for a match Jones’s side can ill afford to lose and considerably more experienced. Almost half of Jones’s training squad have never featured in the Six Nations, including Freddie Steward, who has stood out in his brief international career at full‑back but is yet to make an appearance for England away from Twickenham. “It’s something that’s very hard to replicate – that hostility from the crowd,” Steward said. “It’s definitely going to be a new experience. We’re working really hard in the week trying to prepare ourselves mentally for that hostility and trying to make sure it doesn’t affect our performance.” Jones has been given a boost with Sanderson confirming Manu Tuilagi is available for selection for Sale against Harlequins this weekend. England’s match against Italy the following week may come too soon but Jones would welcome the 30-year-old’s availability for the remainder of the competition.",Sport/Sport,Tom Curry leads pack to be England’s Six Nations captain against Scotland,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/02/tom-curry-leads-pack-to-be-englands-six-nations-captain-against-scotland
2/3/2022,"The Cleveland Browns are the latest NFL team to be accused of offering bonuses for losing games. Former head coach Hue Jackson and one of his associates said the team offered the bonuses during the 2016 and 2017 seasons when the Browns won just one of their 32 games. The poor run allowed the team to secure the No 1 overall pick in the 2017 and 2018 drafts, which they used to select star players Myles Garrett and Baker Mayfield.  “The recent comments by Hue Jackson and his representatives relating to his tenure as our head coach are completely fabricated,” a Browns spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday. “Any accusation that any member of our organization was incentivized to deliberately lose games is categorically false.” Congratulations #brianflores for your bravery. We have records that will help your case. DM me. @NFL and @nflcommish knew about this and covered it up. They did this @Browns . Paid Brown, DePodesta and Berry bonus $ along with @huejack10 to TANK for 2016 and 2017.@espn https://t.co/YOnqArWlnL Kimberly Diemert, the head of Jackson’s charitable foundation, alleged on Tuesday that Browns owner Jimmy Haslam had offered “tanking” bonuses to Jackson, chief strategy officer Paul DePodesta, former executive vice-president of football operations Sashi Brown and current Browns general manager Andrew Berry. “@NFL and @nflcommish knew about this and covered it up,” Diemert wrote on Twitter. “They did this @Browns . Paid Brown, DePodesta and Berry bonus $ along with @huejack10 to TANK for 2016 and 2017. @espn.” In response to another tweet about tanking allegations, Jackson replied: “Well Jimmy Haslam, was happy while we kept losing.” Another tweet suggested Jackson would be on the Forbes rich list if he had been paid for every game Cleveland lost, to which he replied: “Trust me it was a good number!” On Wednesday Diemert told ESPN that proof over the alleged offer of bonuses is “well documented” and had been “presented to the [NFL]”. The Browns’ statement came after former Miami Dolphins head coach Brian Flores said he was offered $100,000 bonuses to lose by the team’s owner, Stephen Ross. The Dolphins have denied those claims. Flores’ allegations were part of a lawsuit that alleges the NFL and its teams discriminate against Black head coaches and the league is run like “a plantation”. Both Jackson and Flores are Black. On Wednesday, Jackson told ESPN that “it’s time to take a stand. What I want is what Brian [Flores] wants which is for this BS to change for black coaches. I lived this same crap.” NFL teams in a rebuilding phase often trade away their best players, something that usually leads to poor results and better draft selections with which to build for the future. However, deliberately losing is a different matter and would be hard to achieve as, aside from their competitive pride, players and coaches know their future employment in the NFL depends on producing results. Deliberately losing in order to fix bets is a federal crime and there is no suggestion that was the case at the Browns or Dolphins.",Sport/Sport,Cleveland Browns latest NFL team to deny they offered bonuses to lose,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/02/cleveland-browns-latest-nfl-team-to-deny-they-offered-bonuses-to-lose
2/3/2022,"And now they’re gonna believe it. Nine months on from the conclusion of a season which saw Celtic finish an embarrassing 25 points behind Rangers, the sense of a pendulum swing is impossible to ignore. The finest 90 minutes of Ange Postecoglou’s reign saw Celtic maul Rangers, with the added benefit of moving past their city rivals at the summit of the Scottish Premiership. Incredibly, given the earlier gulf between the teams, Celtic now have to be the favourites to win the league. It seemed fitting that Reo Hatate, a player coaxed from Japan to Celtic on account of Postecoglou’s direct knowledge, was central to this success. Rangers had nobody on display to match the midfielder’s level of influence. Giovanni van Bronckhorst has Aaron Ramsey to introduce to the fray at some point but this was a bruising night for Rangers and their manager. For all Celtic’s progress, there has been obvious regression at Ibrox. The outcome here was in no way flattering to Celtic, who played with a confidence level that depicts champions.  Celtic entered this fixture having failed to beat their oldest foes in seven attempts. Progress under Postecoglou has been obvious but the manager is experienced enough to comprehend judgments are made on marquee matches. Given the momentum gathered by Celtic in recent months this felt like Postecoglou’s opportune moment to deliver. And, boy did he. Celtic were desperate for a positive opening and duly claimed one. There was – naturally – controversy attached to the opening goal, beautifully angled home by Hatate from the edge of the penalty area. Rangers complained bitterly that the referee, Bobby Madden, should have stopped the game following a clash of heads between Calvin Bassey and Joe Aribo as they tried to clear a Matt O’Riley corner. Bassey was lying on the turf as, seconds later, the Japanese midfielder sent Celtic Park into raptures. Debate over the legitimacy of the goal will run and run. What cannot be denied is Celtic started the game as by far the better team. Allan McGregor in the visiting goal produced a stunning double save from Jota and Giorgos Giakoumakis in the 15th minute as the hosts looked to double their lead. McGregor, days after his 40th birthday, denied Giakoumakis twice more before the half hour. Rangers lay firmly on the ropes, their only opportunity of the first half seeing Joe Hart race out to beat Scott Arfield to an Aribo pass. That opening arrived just moments before Celtic claimed the second goal their dominance fully merited. Hatate again claimed it, this time with very little backlift from 20 yards. McGregor, diving to his left, was totally helpless. There was more to come from rampant Celtic before the interval. Hatate’s next trick was to deliver a glorious cross from the left, that found the Rangers defence completely static. Liel Abada took full advantage to prod beyond McGregor. Celtic did not want the half to end; Rangers desperately needed any form of respite. Having watched Rangers ship three goals in back-to-back league games for the first time since 1986, Van Bronckhorst used half-time to make a triple substitution. Amad Diallo, the on-loan Manchester United forward who spent 45 minutes resembling a little boy lost, was understandably among those removed. The switches did afford Rangers a little more prominence but only that. Fashion Sakala and Arfield spurned their finest chances for consolation, with Ryan Jack cracking the crossbar from range. Celtic gave the impression of playing comfortably within themselves. McGregor tipped an O’Riley free-kick over as Celtic closed the game in pursuit of a fourth. That it did not arrive failed to perturb anybody in the stands. Followers of Rangers, locked out of the Old Firm game, were done a favour. Postecoglou has presided over a quite astonishing turnaround. “We shall not be moved” bellowed out from the stands. On this evidence, it is difficult to argue.",Sport/Football,Reo Hatate hits double to help rampant Celtic replace Rangers at top of table,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/02/celtic-rangers-scottish-premiership-match-report
2/3/2022,"Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, became the latest tech company to suffer a dramatic share price slump on Wednesday as it reported higher costs and slowing growth.  Reporting its first earnings under its new name, the social media company revealed it had spent $10bn on its vision of the future – the “metaverse” – and warned it faced “headwinds from both increased competition for people’s time and a shift of engagement”. Meta’s share price dropped 20% in after-hours trading. After a boom during the pandemic, shareholders have punished formerly hot tech companies including Netflix and PayPal for disappointing results. While Meta’s revenues were slightly higher than expected at $33.67bn for the last three months, it reported a slightly lower number of daily active users – 1.93 billion against 1.92 billion last quarter. Facebook’s growth has stalled in the US and Europe but the latest falls came from Africa and Latin America. Facebook announced it was changing its name to Meta last October. Co-founder Mark Zuckerberg wants to refocus the company on ambitious plans to build a virtual reality “metaverse”. Meta also revealed for the first time how much it had spent so far on its new strategy. The company’s Reality Labs division, which makes virtual reality goggles, smart glasses and other yet-to-be-released products spent more than $10bn in 2021. The spending dragged down quarterly profits by 8% and Zuckerberg has indicated that there is much more spending to come. The company set out a series of issues that could affect growth in the near term, including platform and regulatory changes, as well as tough comparisons to a year when online advertising was boosted by the pandemic. The move also followed a series of crises at the company which has been blamed for promoting fake news worldwide, stoking hostilities and invading privacy.",News/Technology,Facebook shares slump 20% amid higher costs and slowing growth,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/02/facebook-shares-slump-growth-fourth-quarter
2/3/2022,"Chelsea brushed aside 10-player Manchester United to book a place in the Continental League Cup final for the third season in a row. First-half goals from Pernille Harder, Jessie Fleming and Jess Carter sandwiched Vilde Bøe Risa’s reply for United and gave the back-to-back League Cup champions a trip to Plough Lane on 5 March where they will play the winner of the game on Thursday night between Manchester City and Tottenham.  “Every game is [important] but when you’re champions you have got something to protect,” Emma Hayes, the Chelsea manager, said. “We like being champions and we knew that the final was down here.” The United manager, Marc Skinner, who lost goalkeeper Sophie Baggaley with 12 minutes remaining after she took out Sam Kerr, expressed his frustration at the absence of Hayley Ladd and Ella Toone. The pair were suspended after picking up two yellow cards each in United’s run of five games to the semi-final, while Chelsea, as a Champions League team, entered the competition at the quarter final stage so did not have the same problem. “The rules need to change for next year,” he said. “We were at a disadvantage tonight.” Skinner had insisted his side is a “different team” to the one that shipped six against Chelsea in a 6-1 defeat in the league at the end of September. But this was not a manager talking up his side without reason. United were on a seven-game unbeaten run, with seven clean sheets to boot, before this trip to Kingsmeadow. Chelsea have also seen an improvement in form, having not lost a game in 2022 after a tough end to last year when they were eliminated from the Champions League. Now, though, the fixtures are coming fast and the squad is being stretched. On a chilly night, Hayes was without Melanie Leupolz, who is struggling with long Covid, Beth England, Ji So-yun whose wonder-strike knocked her teammate Kerr’s Australia out of the Asian Cup, and the defensive duo Maren Mjelde and Magda Eriksson, the latter suffering with a deltoid injury. Despite the absentees, and with Kerr and Fran Kirby on the bench, Chelsea’s rhythm looked surprisingly free of disruption. Instead, it was United that seemed out of kilter without Ladd shielding the defence and the creative engine Toone. Leading the line, the Denmark forward Harder broke the deadlock. She collected Aniek Nouwen’s clipped ball over the top, raced shoulder to shoulder with the defender Aoife Mannion, before cutting inside the centre-back, then cutting back round the outside of her, before wrong-footing Baggaley and rolling the ball into an empty net. Chelsea’s second lacked the same finesse. Guro Reiten’s shot deflected high into the air and Olympic gold medallist Fleming nodded the ball downwards, sending it bouncing high over Baggaley and in. Almost instantly, fuelled by the frustration at having let in two in five minutes having not conceded since 5 December, United hit back. The Chelsea full-back Carter was caught out by Bøe Risa and she fed Jackie Groenen who sent a neat backheel back into the path of the midfielder who stepped forward and lashed in from a tight angle. As if to atone for her error, a gut-busting run from Carter put her in the six-yard box to meet Reiten’s cross from close range to re-establish the two-goal margin. “She told me she was annoyed at the [United] goal,” Hayes said. Skinner handed Signe Bruun her debut in the second half, replacing the ineffective Martha Thomas, but United struggled to break through the more focused Chelsea backline. It was the introduction of Kerr, fresh off a flight from India and having taken part in only half a training session, that breathed life back into the game. She forced United down to 10 players after Baggaley upended her, conceding a free-kick and earning a red card as the last player. United can take some comfort in their performance; the gap is closing. But Chelsea’s controlled display and depth of experience shone through.",Sport/Football,Harder leads Chelsea past Manchester United and into League Cup final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/02/chelsea-manchester-united-fa-womens-league-cup-semi-final-match-report
