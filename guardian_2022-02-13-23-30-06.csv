2/13/2022,"A leading media defence lawyer has urged MPs to show “guts” and act to protect public interest journalism in England and Wales from the existential threat she says is posed by public figures and bodies attempting to shut down criticism. Caroline Kean, a partner at Wiggin, represented the journalist Catherine Belton when she was sued by multiple Russian billionaires including Roman Abramovich and the Russian state oil company Rosneft. Kean is also defending FT journalist Tom Burgis against a lawsuit brought by an arm of the Kazakh mining company ENRC.  Both libel actions have been criticised by free speech campaigners and were highlighted in a recent debate in the House of Commons about abusive legal actions known as strategic lawsuits against public participation, or “Slapps”. Kean said the interest in Slapps was welcome but must be backed by legislation to prevent public interest journalism from being shut down. “You can look at the balance of power and the type of person that’s bringing it [the lawsuit],” said Kean. “If it is somebody who is in a controversial area and they have quite often had a lot of material written about them in the past and they are very wealthy, you should expect them to tolerate a degree of criticism – I mean that in the proper sense of the word, not necessarily negative criticism – and exploration of what they’re doing, how it impacts on society, what their motives might be, what their working practices should be. “I think it is healthy for democracy and in the public interest to have that debate, without being afraid that one aspect of that criticism will meet the displeasure of somebody who has the wealth to squash it.” Kean said publishers often settled cases because of the costs of proceeding to trial and fears they would be deterred from investigations into important issues like the origin and purpose of foreign investment in the UK, big pharma and cladding companies. “It’s really important for everybody who cares about this to put their shoulders to the wheel and make sure that something does happen,” she said. “It is interesting to know whether the MPs will have the guts to pass something.” Her suggestion to level the playing field is for judges to decide at the outset of a case whether it relates to public interest journalism – in other words, is the subject matter and company/individual worthy of scrutiny – and if so, it should be halted and resolved by granting a prominent right to reply. “I think Catherine’s case is a really good case in point,’” said Kean. “That [Putin’s People] is a really serious book on a really serious subject. I think that would be a perfect book for a judge to read and say: ‘OK, if you’ve made any mistakes or not given as much balance to something as somebody wants then they’ve got to have the right to reply – but, no, they can’t sue you.’” Belton and her publisher, HarperCollins, were sued over a number of matters in the book. All of the claims were subsequently settled or withdrawn. Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea FC, ended his case after HarperCollins accepted some information concerning him was inaccurate and agreed to make revisions to the book. HarperCollins apologised and agreed to make a payment to charity in recognition of a particular error, but otherwise no damages were paid and both sides agreed to pay their own costs. Kean acknowledged that it was difficult for the public to understand why there should be any inaccuracies in journalism but said: “The real public interest is in having debate. When you take a sentence or two out of a book of five or 600 pages, and you say: ‘Oh, those two might not be quite completely right, and therefore you shouldn’t have an interest in publishing it,’ what happens then is the journalist goes on trial and … everything is put under the most minute scrutiny, which is holding people up to an impossible standard.” In the Commons debate, the justice minister, James Cartlidge, agreed that Slapps represented “an abuse of the legal system”, but said the government response must be “proportionate … balancing individual rights with the public good”.",News/Law,MPs must show ‘guts’ to save public interest journalism in England and Wales,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/feb/13/mps-show-guts-public-interest-journalism-england-wales-caroline-kean
2/13/2022,"Now that travel restrictions are easing, the European city break is back on. But since it’s been so long for so many of us, why stop at just one destination? Step forward the multi-city break: put three cities together, link them with easy-to-book train or bus journeys and you’ve got a full-on adventure. I decide on Spain for my first post-Covid trip, plotting a route from Bilbao to Barcelona and then on to Madrid. Together, the trio of cities promises an unbeatable combination of food, art and beaches, and an insight into three different regions. Instead of wrangling with complicated foreign rail websites, I book tickets through an app, Omio, which pulls up timetables, reserves my seats and deposits tickets on my phone.  After being grounded for so long, arriving in Bilbao is almost overwhelming. The city has undergone a renaissance in the past two decades, and the banks of the Nervión river are dotted with elegant fin-de-siècle buildings and flanked with wide boulevards. I dip into the city’s charming old town, and bag a table on the buzzy Plaza Nueva – a square edged with cafés. The city is famous for its pinxtos: tapas-like snacks on a slice of baguette. I pick three – mushroom, stuffed with blue cheese and Serrano ham, soft-shell crab and roasted peppers with tuna. All are lipsmackingly good. Bilbao unarguably ticks the first of my holiday wishes – amazing Mediterranean food – but it also delivers world-class art, thanks to the city’s iconic Guggenheim Museum. Frank Gehry’s extraordinary building – a sinuous, metallic wrap – is home to works by Mark Rothko, Jenny Holzer and Anselm Kiefer, among others. The artworks extend outside: Jeff Koons’s 12m tall, flower-clad Puppy (currently under scaffolding for a refit) guards the front entrance, while Maman – Louise Bourgeois’s huge spider – looms over the riverside walkway behind. Between the art and all the eating I don’t make it down to Bilbao’s coastline, content in the knowledge that Barcelona’s sun-kissed beaches are my next stop. It takes almost seven hours to reach the Catalan capital, but although I’ve bought plenty of books, I spend most of the time watching the spectacular Spanish landscape. The further we travel inland, the more the landscapes open up: vast, rust-hued plains that feel like something out of the Arizona desert. After Bilbao, Barcelona feels almost like another country. The sky is an unbroken blue, La Rambla seethes with tourists and when I reach the beach, the sea is dotted with swimmers. A vast cruise ship glides past and as I settle into a bar and order a plate of paella and a cold beer, it feels almost as if the pandemic never happened. The chilled-out, beachy vibe is the perfect tonic after two years of blustery walks beside English seas. Having been starved of travel for so long, it feels as if I have a free pass to be as much of a tourist as possible. I jump on the sightseeing bus, stopping off at the Fundació Joan Miró for the chance to revisit paintings by one of my all-time favourite artists. Afterwards, I visit the Parc de Montjuïc and take a ride on the cable car, which gives extraordinary views over the city’s skyline to the towering spindles of Gaudí’s Sagrada Família. After the long trek from Bilbao, the two-hour journey to Madrid passes with lightning speed. A quick hop on the tube and I’m at my hotel in the heart of the historic Habsburg district. Madrid is best explored on foot; I stroll past the sprawling frontage of the pristine Royal Palace and pause on the steps of the Almudena cathedral to hear a busker playing Spanish guitar, before tipping up at the Mercado de San Miguel, a cast-iron and glass temple to all things foodie, dating back to 1916, where I settle in the sun and eat crispy empanada, a mozzarella pintxo and a cone of crispy fried squid. The following day I satisfy all my art cravings with a visit to the extraordinary Thyssen-Bornemisza museum. Rather like a greatest hits of the art world, the walls are filled with world-famous works by everyone from Picasso to O’Keeffe. After a happy afternoon exploring Retiro Park and through the tangled, bustling streets of Sol, I end my trip up on the roof terrace of my hotel watching the sun slowly drift and fade behind the city rooftops. Madrid’s frenetic buzz feels so different to Barcelona’s laid-back, seasidey vibe and Bilbao’s bustling port that it feels as if I’ve had not one holiday but three: the perfect antidote to months of Covid curbs.

2/13/2022,"How do you conquer your Fomo (fear of missing out)? Richard Orlando, Quebec Send new questions to nq@theguardian.com.  Surely the pandemic has put paid to Fomo? We’ve all been missing out for nearly two years. TopGyre I find that I have the perfect antidote. Whenever I might fleetingly feel any envious Fomo propelling me towards taking some new action or other, it’s immediately and decisively nullified by my constitutional Itoba (inability to be arsed). ThereisnoOwl The world is big, and full of many wonderful things. You WILL miss out on many of them. Once I accepted that, I was free to start enjoying the wonderful things right in front of me. Therapy helps a lot. PumezaAbroad I have poor self-control with my phone, failing to impose/abide by any limits I set. To combat this, I have trialled, for over two years, deleting all social media accounts. I still spend far too much time on my phone (mainly reading the Guardian), but a small positive outcome is that I have no idea what everyone else is up to, so I never fear missing out. nogoodboyo89 Ditch Facebook. Unamika (and Pennyfeather) Avoid social media if it makes you feel worse. Organise the stuff you want to do. Text your friends to go to the pub, book the gig tickets, etc. Appreciate what you have. You have to be a Zen master not to feel sad if you’ve been left out of someone’s plans. I think everyone feels like that sometimes; it’s only human. Figaro2 The answer is to not sit around waiting for people to invite you to stuff. Get your validation from pursuing the things you enjoy to the extent that you don’t have time to worry about what other people are up to. Eventually, you will reach a point where you don’t care what other people are doing and are just happy that they are having fun, too. doowenday Build a nourishing life. For me, that includes time in nature, playing with my dog, cribbage with someone dear, reading printed books, drawing, playing musical instruments, small amounts of volunteering, and giving my co-workers specific, regular, positive feedback or thanks. It also means that I plan and relish my meals, even though they are simple sweet potatoes and beans, or oatmeal, or just a great coffee or tea. Take the time to journal a bit, to better treasure your life. Even cataloguing the books you’ve read – or movies you’ve watched, or walks you’ve taken – with little notes about what birds and plants you observed. Journaling is transformative and healing. Be sure to move your body each day. Maybe choose a new skill to learn. I’m learning country line dancing at home, so I can dance with or without a partner when the pandemic abates. quiettess Live your life, not what you are told to live. That way, you don’t miss out on your life by living someone else’s idea of the perfect life. Do what makes you happy and healthy. DewinDwl Once you master the art of enjoying time by yourself and being alone, then you will probably never get Fomo again. Remember, nobody is invited to everything, and often people’s memories, recollections, descriptions, videos or photographs of events make them look and sound a lot more fun than they actually were. The chances are that, during whatever you missed out on, the people present were secretly just waiting to go home. spat321 Miss out deliberately. Stay home. The next day, ask people how the evening went. (Spoiler: average.) Then be happy that you stayed home. DerDeutsche When I was a teenager (many years ago), I longed to go to the cool youth club that the really popular girls used to go to. They used to talk about it all week and, to 14-year-old me, it sounded wonderful. One week, I was invited, too. It meant two buses there and back and an agonising time choosing what to wear beforehand. Actually, it was quite boring. DoraMarr I find misanthropy does the trick. TheGoodThief Honestly? I’m too tired now, and everyone I know in real life is too tired. The toll of the past few years has made its mark, in that it is hard to look ahead or from side to side, and Fomo has been burned away. But it has also made me appreciate simple things like tea and cake with a friend. I look forward to those things now in the way I would have looked forward to travelling or a concert before. Forestdream You should read Oliver Burkeman’s book Four Thousand Weeks. He suggests that once you accept that, because you have limited time on this earth, you’ll miss out on most things, it becomes easier to enjoy the relatively few things you are experiencing right now. Don’t rush the current activity, and so ruin the enjoyment of it, just so you can satiate your Fomo by getting on to the next experience. Enjoy the ride while it lasts. TopGyre I grew older. Fear of missing out turned into relief at situations avoided. Live your own life, not your (often imaginary) view of someone else’s. BitBoringPeter Oh yes.

2/13/2022,"Kamila Valieva is so talented she does not need to take drugs, her choreographer has insisted, as the brilliant 15-year-old Russian skater waits to see whether she will be sent home from the Winter Games. The court of arbitration for sport met by video camera on Sunday evening in Beijing to discuss Valieva’s case after she tested positive for the banned angina drug trimetazidine, and says it will announce its verdict over whether her provision suspension should be reimposed on Monday.  However when Valieva’s choreographer, Alexei Zheleznyakov, was asked on Instagram why she had returned a positive sample on Christmas Day, he strongly defended his skater’s integrity. “I’m not a god, I have no idea,” he replied. “There are a lot of options, but I’m sure of one thing: Kami doesn’t touch anything forbidden in life, with her talent it’s not necessary.” Earlier on Sunday Valieva continued to train in the hope of being given the all-clear to skate in the individual event on Tuesday, where she is an overwhelming favourite to win her second gold of the Games. After her routine she was applauded by her coach Eteri Tutberidze, who herself is under the spotlight, and the Russian press. Meanwhile the scrutiny of Valieva’s support staff has increased after the World Anti-Doping Agency said it would ask its independent intelligence and investigations department to look into the coaches, doctors and other adults surrounding her. Because Valieva is under 16 Wada’s code requires that an investigation is automatically required into her support personnel. However the Olympic Games executive director Christophe Dubi said it was important to remember the “human side of this story … to think about a person of 15 in this situation”, and added: “We need to treat this situation extremely carefully.” Cas will decide on Monday whether to reintroduce a provisional suspension that was first imposed by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency last week, before a committee overturned it on appeal. A decision on whether an offence has been committed – and whether the Russian Olympic Committee will keep its team gold – will be made at a later date.",Sport/Sport,Kamila Valieva’s choreographer says talented skater has no need for drugs,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/13/kamila-valievas-choreographer-says-talented-skater-has-no-need-for-drugs
2/13/2022,"Priti Patel, the UK home secretary, has been accused by her Labour counterpart of bearing some responsibility for the public’s lack of trust in the police in the wake of last week’s resignation of the UK’s top officer. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said Patel had been “silent” on policing for a year while failing to implement reforms or defend the model of policing by consent.  Her criticisms follow the dramatic resignation of Cressida Dick as Metropolitan police commissioner on Thursday evening after the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, made clear he had no confidence in her plans to reform the service. On Sunday morning, Labour and the Conservatives traded blows over police failings and who was to blame for Dick’s surprise resignation in the wake of a series of scandals around misogyny and racism within the force. Appearing on BBC One’s Sunday Morning programme, Cooper said Patel has failed to tackle systemic and cultural issues including reforms to training, vetting, and misconduct strategy. She said: “I strongly believe in the British policing model policing by consent. I think that’s something we should be proud of, but that means we also have to defend it, stand up for it and also deliver reforms that will achieve it. “At the moment, there’s been none of those reforms from the home secretary. The home secretary has been silent on policing for a year. We have not seen any of the kinds of reforms to policing that we need.” Sources close to Patel have hit back, claiming the home secretary had begun reforming police training colleges and police crime commissioners, and had sent the HMIC (Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary) into the Met. ‘What does she [Cooper] actually want to do? She just says reform vetting and training, but what?” said an aide. Dick’s departure followed a barrage of criticism of the force including over its handling of the case of Sarah Everard, who was raped and murdered by a serving Met officer, and recent revelations of officers bragging about violence towards women and exchanging racist and Islamophobic messages. Patel was angered by the London mayor’s failure to inform her that he had called Dick to a meeting on Thursday afternoon, which she considered “unprofessional”. The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, claimed on Sunday that Khan had played politics to force Dick out. He told Times Radio: “I think he should’ve been consulting with the home secretary, bearing in mind this is a man who just a couple of months ago extended Cressida Dick’s contract.” Asked if he thought the mayor was playing politics, he responded: “Possibly, to be frank.” Responding to Lewis’s comments, a source close to Khan said it was the mayor’s job to hold the Met to account. They said: “It is absolutely right that he ensures it has the right leadership to command the trust and confidence of Londoners.” Pressure is building on Patel and Khan to agree on who will replace Dick, amid reports that the home secretary could look abroad for a successor. The Mail on Sunday claimed that among the shortlisted officers were the Queensland police commissioner, Katarina Carroll. By convention, the commissioner is drawn from the ranks of serving senior officers in the UK. Home Office sources said they could recruit from abroad but it was likely the next commissioner would come from the UK. In the Observer this weekend, Khan wrote that he would not support the appointment of a new commissioner “unless they can clearly demonstrate that they understand the scale of the cultural problems within the Met and the urgency with which they must be addressed”. The mayor’s office for police and crime is in discussions with the Home Office about the process to recruit the next commissioner. Sources close to the mayor indicated that he remained “open-minded’ as to who that person might be. Whoever follows Dick will have to deal with “a real cultural issue” in the force that cannot be fixed overnight, according to former HM Inspector of Constabulary Zoë Billingham. She told Trevor Phillips on Sunday: “Whoever the incoming commissioner is, they will have a very very full inbox. They will have precisely the same problems that Cressida was contending with to deal with.” ",News/Politics,"Priti Patel partly responsible for lack of trust in police, says Labour",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/13/priti-patel-partly-responsible-for-lack-of-trust-in-police-says-labour-yvette-cooper
