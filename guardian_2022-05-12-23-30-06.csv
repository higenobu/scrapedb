5/12/2022,"The UK has become “the jurisdiction of choice for dirty money”, harming both its national reputation and democratic institutions, a cross-party group of MPs has warned as they urged a new government focus on money laundering and corruption. An economic crime manifesto launched by the group calls for measures including major transparency reforms for company records, a crackdown on tax avoidance in UK overseas territories, and more resources for enforcement. Other ideas include making it an offence to fail to prevent crimes such as money laundering or targeting bankers, and a dedicated office for economic whistleblowers. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent emergency measures taken against potentially illicit Russian money in the UK had been a wake-up call as to the scale of the issue, the MPs said. Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who is co-leading the initiative and who chairs the all-party group on anti-corruption, said: “This is a huge problem. Our financial services and our defences against dirty money have been overrun.” “London is now the laundromat for washing dirty cash, and we can’t go on like this,” she said. “Britain will not prosper economically on the back of dirty money. Our national security is under threat, our economy is suffering, and our democratic values are being undermined.” An economic crime bill rushed through parliament in March set up a register of the ultimate owners of overseas-held UK property, while a subsequent bill, unveiled in this week’s Queen’s speech, will tighten up companies records, among other measures. However, Hodge, who launched the manifesto in parliament on Thursday alongside the Conservative MP Kevin Hollinrake, who is co-chair of the all-party group on fair business banking, said more was needed, and that there had been a particular lack of action over money laundering. “That has meant that we have become the jurisdiction of choice for dirty money, a safe haven for dirty money,” she said. Among the recommendations in the report is the creation by early 2023 of public registers of beneficial ownership in UK overseas territories and crown dependencies. A number of these territories have been linked to financial irregularity, with the premier of the British Virgin Islands arrested in the US last month over allegations of cocaine importation and money laundering. The manifesto calls for the immediate allocation of an extra £300m to be spent on economic crime enforcement, contrasting the UK’s record on this with the resources devoted to parallel agencies in the US. “As economic crime has become a greater problem, our agencies have done less and less,” Hodge said. The focus on Russian money meant more attention was being paid to the issue, she added: “Did Ukraine bring it to a head? Sadly, yes. We don’t celebrate that but we’re going to, obviously, grasp the opportunity it presents to do something.” Hollinrake said concerted government action was especially needed to overcome corporate reluctance over ideas such as offences of failing to prevent money laundering. “There are huge vested interests,” he said. “If you’re a chief executive of a big bank and you think there’s a prospect of having your collar felt if things go wrong in your bank, you’re going to go to the Treasury and say, ‘Don’t do that.’”",News/Politics,Cross-party MPs call for more action on money laundering and corruption,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/12/cross-party-mps-money-laundering-corruption-economic-crime

5/12/2022,"Less than a year after signing with Paris Saint-Germain – one of Qatar’s most prominent sportswashing projects – Lionel Messi is now the face of yet another oppressive Middle Eastern monarchy. The Argentinian was unveiled as the latest tourism ambassador for Saudi Arabia during a trip to Jeddah, a port city along the Red Sea, on Monday. “This is not his first visit to the kingdom and it will not be the last,” said Ahmed al-Khateeb, the kingdom’s minister of tourism, in a tweet with images of Messi being welcomed at King Abdulaziz International Airport. I am pleased to welcome Lionel Messi to Saudi Arabia We are excited for you to explore the treasures of the Red Sea, the Jeddah Season and our ancient history.This is not his first visit to the Kingdom and it will not be the last! @VisitSaudiNow pic.twitter.com/RDfxFIRjrt Messi, who was accompanied by his Argentina and PSG teammate Leandro Paredes, later posted a picture of himself relaxing on a yacht while watching the sunset. “Discovering the Red Sea #VisitSaudi,” read the caption on the post, which was marked as a “paid partnership” with Visit Saudi, a subsidiary of the Saudi Tourism Authority. Messi was later accompanied by Princess Haifa Al-Saud, assistant minister of tourism, as they toured various parts of old Jeddah. “I am glad that he was mesmerized by its essence, heritage and beauty,” Princess Haifa later wrote on Twitter. The first thing to point out is that Messi does not need to take whatever incredibly large sum Saudi Arabia has thrown his way. Last year alone he made $122m through salary and sponsorship, making him the second-highest paid athlete in the world behind LeBron James. Simply put, Messi has enough money that his future grandchildren won’t need to work a day in their lives. He could have politely declined the Saudi offer and still lived out a very comfortable retirement. And, yet, unless Messi has a hitherto undisclosed passion for spreading the word about Saudi Arabia’s undiscovered cultural highlights, this is all about greed. And the effects will be toxic. By accepting a role as Saudi Arabia’s tourism ambassador, Messi has effectively aligned himself with a regime linked to countless human rights abuses, including the infamous assassination of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, its devastating war in Yemen that has caused a humanitarian catastrophe, and its crackdown on intellectuals, LGBTI+ people, reformers, and women’s rights activists. Messi’s trip to Jeddah also underscores how the kingdom continues to use sports to beautify its public image. This process is known as sportswashing, a term popularized by Amnesty International to describe the use of sports by oppressive governments to legitimize their regimes and distract from their human rights abuses. Ahead of Messi’s latest trip to Saudi, he was urged by families of political prisoners in the kingdom to refuse offers to become the face of Saudi tourism. Their letter, which was organized by human rights advocacy body Grant Liberty, noted that “the Saudi regime wants to use you to launder its reputation.” “If you say ‘yes’ to Visit Saudi you are in effect saying yes to all the human rights abuses that take place today in modern Saudi Arabia,” read the letter, which was first published in February 2021. “But if you say ‘no’ you will send an equally powerful message – that human rights matter, that decency matters, that those who torture and murder do not do so with impunity. The world must stand up to those who trample on others.” Messi’s history with the kingdom dates back to 2011, when he led his country in a friendly match against the Saudi national team. He has since returned to play on numerous occasions, including the 2019 Superclasico de las Americas and the 2020 Spanish Super Cup. He has also appeared on billboards advertising the 2022 Riyadh Season entertainment festival organized by the Saudi government. The seven-time Balon d’Or winner’s repeated appearances in Saudi Arabia are due to the kingdom’s strategic transformation into an alluring hub for international sports events. Over the past few years, Saudi has signed a 10-year, $650m deal for a Formula One motor racing event, invested millions in a Saudi International golf event, partnered with World Wrestling Entertainment for annual shows, and hosted some of the biggest boxing showdowns in recent memory. Last year, a group led by Saudi’s sovereign wealth fund – an entity headed by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman – purchased Newcastle United, providing Saudi with an influential position in English football and an international platform to launder its reputation. It also marked the latest football team to be bought by a Middle Eastern regime with bottomless pockets, following the likes of Manchester City, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi royal family, and Paris Saint Germain, owned by the Qatar sovereign wealth fund. Saudi’s partnership with Messi comes after David Beckham signed a $200m deal to become Qatar’s cultural ambassador ahead of the 2022World Cup. The 10-year-deal, which began in 2021, will see the English football legend promote the country’s tourism and culture. “For Qatar, not only is it an inspiring moment to bring together some of the biggest players and fans from around the region, but also a chance to show off the country, its history and culture,” Beckham said last month. As Saudi continues to expand its influence in the world of sports and entertainment, its newfound partnership with Messi – one of the most recognizable athletes in the world – is arguably among its most pivotal achievements. The Argentine has 326 million followers on Instagram and will continue to use his platform to promote Saudi Arabia, which, in turn, will have a positive effect on tourism. “It is a distinguished and unique step for Messi to become an ambassador for Saudi tourism due to the influence the player has, which will reflect positively on Jeddah’s position as a tourist destination,” Sami Al Jaber, a retired Saudi football player regarded as one of the greatest strikers in the nation’s history, wrote on Twitter. In Messi, the Saudi government has a premier athlete with a built-in audience and platform ready to be utilized for political gain. While Messi was once lauded for his humanitarian efforts with Unicef and his own charitable foundation, his recent alignment with Saudi raises concerns that he is willing to blatantly disregard human rights in exchange for lucrative deals with brutal dictators.

5/12/2022,"Apple has lost its crown as the world’s most valuable company to oil giant Saudi Aramco, as soaring commodity prices swell profits at energy companies and technology stocks continue to slide. In a sign that the old economy is reasserting itself over the new this year, Saudi Aramco eclipsed Apple on Wednesday night amid the ongoing rout on Wall Street. Apple, which had become the world’s first 3 trillion dollar company in early January, saw its shares sink another 5% on Wednesday, knocking its value down to $2.37tn (£1.94tn) – an 18% drop this year. This pulled the iPhone maker’s valuation below Aramco, whose market capitalisation has climbed by a quarter this year to hit $2.43tn, stoked by the surge in oil prices since the Ukraine war began. Aramco’s rise comes a decade after the watershed moment in 2011 when Apple surpassed another energy giant, ExxonMobil, to become the world’s most valuable listed company. Since then, Apple, Microsoft, Google’s owner Alphabet and Amazon have dominated stock markets, hitting and then surpassing $1tn valuations and pushing oil giants out of the top ranks. Only Saudi Aramco has regularly featured among the most valuable. Neil Wilson of Markets.com said there was “something symbolic in tech being overtaken by oil”, adding that “this steamroller of a bear market” was pushing stocks down. The two companies have traded the top spot before. Aramco became the world’s biggest listed company when it floated on Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul stock exchange in December 2019, and would have been bigger than Exxon if it had been a public company a decade ago. Apple surged back to overtake Aramco in July 2020 as the pandemic boosted demand for technology products and services. This latest changing of the guard highlights how the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, soaring inflation and the current Covid-19 lockdowns in China are all creating economic turmoil. “Apple posted better than expected results in the quarter ended March 2022,” explained Parth Vala, analyst at GlobalData. “However, amid the increasing supply chain constraints on account of the rapidly changing global geopolitical scenarios, silicon shortages and intense lockdowns in China, the company anticipates that the June quarter could take a revenue hit between the range of $4bn and $8bn.” In contrast, Aramco is seeing bumper revenues and earnings, having doubled its profits last year. In its first-quarter earnings due on Sunday, it is expected to report that net income almost doubled to about $38bn in the January-March period. “The Russia-Ukraine conflict has sent the global energy prices soaring, which resulted in the energy companies booking substantial top-line and bottom-line growth,” Vala added. Aramco has a particularly low cost of production, as much of its oil is in easy-to-tap fields onshore or in shallow waters. That boosts profitability at the firm, which is still 95% owned by the Saudi government. James Meyer, chief investment officer at Tower Bridge Advisors, has pointed out that Apple and Aramco aren’t comparable in terms of businesses or fundamentals, although the latter has clearly benefited from the tightening commodity market. “They’re the beneficiaries of inflation and tight supply,” Meyer said. The Ukraine invasion drove oil to 13-year highs of about $130 a barrel. Although prices have eased, Brent crude is still trading at $105 a barrel today, up from $77 at the start of year. The surge in energy and food prices this year will leave consumers with less money to spend on non-essential items such as technology products. Higher interest rates have also hits the value of “growth stocks” such as technology companies, which promise higher returns in the future. More than $1tn has been wiped off the valuation of major US tech stocks in the last week, after America’s central bank reasserted its determination to cool inflation from its 40-year high. The Nasdaq Composite Index has tumbled by 27% this year, and 20% since the start of April, while Vanguard’s Energy Index Fund has surged 34% during 2022. The former darlings of the Covid lockdown period have seen their valuations crumble, with Netflix down 72% this year, and Peloton off 65%. It’s a similar story in the UK, where online grocery firm Ocado’s shares have more than halved this year. Having been worth more than Tesco, the UK’s largest supermarket chain, in September 2020, Ocado’s value has now dropped below second-largest grocer Sainsbury’s.",News/Business,Saudi Aramco overtakes Apple as world’s most valuable company,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/12/saudi-aramco-overtakes-apple-worlds-most-valuable-company

5/12/2022,"Thank you, World Rugby! Call me biased, as a current member of the national squad, but inviting the United States to host the 2031 and 2033 men’s and women’s Rugby World Cups is exactly what our sport needs. They know how to host a good party in the US and I believe both tournaments will be gamechangers. As I’ve previously stated a World Cup in America is imperative if we want to propel rugby into a new stratosphere. With Major League Rugby (MLR) now adding to the excitement, interest in the sport is already growing. A Rugby World Cup here will make the sport even bigger. The nine-year countdown will also give USA Rugby time to prepare properly. After the last few years of struggle, both financially and logistically, solid foundations are absolutely crucial. Off the field the challenge is to raise awareness of rugby across local communities. Make it even easier for the American public to access rugby on mainstream sports channels and encourage the sport to showcase itself. Weave that in with a developing national team, benefiting from spending more time with each other, and an attractive MLR domestic league and you have a potentially beautiful marriage. Get it right and the opportunities are vast. “Build it, and they will come” to borrow from Kevin Costner’s movie Field of Dreams. I truly believe we must do all we can to put rugby union in front of the American public. And, crucially, to make it fun. I know new fans to the sport are in awe of the physicality, speed and skill of rugby, not to mention the chance to engage with players far more easily than in certain other American sports. The bid committee is also committed to hosting games in diverse cities and in high-quality stadiums. One of these is the home of my current team, San Diego, located along the beautiful southern California coast. America’s sheer size offers the chance to take the sport to places where it might not normally enjoy widespread attention. By staging the competition all over the country, rugby can inspire and connect with the audience of 360m people that the USA has to offer. That applies to the women’s game as much as the men’s. The rugby audience in America generally is on the rise, with interest in the MLR growing encouragingly. In just the last year, Octagon Sports Tracker indicated that the rugby fanbase in North America has increased by 30% and MLR awareness has jumped by nearly 25%. MLR games are shown on local broadcasting stations, associated with the large sports provider Fox Sports, and every match is streamed live on the Rugby Network. The freshness of the MLR concept is definitely helping. The American (and Canadian) public are getting behind the current 13 franchises and tribal loyalties are being established from Seattle to New Orleans, LA to Toronto and New York to Washington DC. It is also a competition that is not afraid to be proactive on social media, try out new laws, put on a “half-time show” or throw some wild kits and team names out there. Traditional rugby fans may not like the idea of having their sport streamlined and “Americanised”, but the sport needs to be forward-looking to flourish in today’s modern, socially engaging world. Rugby in the USA feels a bit different but in a good way. No disrespect intended but away games in Los Angeles or playing in the backdrop of the “Big Apple” beat a trip up the M1 to Coventry or a long bus ride to Newcastle. Yes, the competition is in its infancy, which poses various challenges, but the only way for the MLR is up. The rugby world definitely needs it. Standards-wise the competition is fierce, with foreign players such as my current teammates Ma’a Nonu and Chris Robshaw mixed in with some exciting American and Canadian talent. It will act as the building ground for the national teams, something that will be huge for USA Rugby as it seeks to build towards 2031 and become genuine competitors. At my age, unfortunately, I’ll miss out on playing in 2031 but the current team still have a part to play in building an exciting future for the sport in the US. Over the past few years we as a rugby nation have been inconsistent, going from the elation of beating Scotland in 2018 to the disappointment of being utterly dismantled by the All Blacks last year. Our eyes are currently set on ensuring we qualify for France 2023 by beating an incredibly passionate and improving Chile side this July. It will be no easy task but we know it is down to us to fuel the growth of USA Rugby and to try to inspire the next generation. Kids will have fresh motivation to play at grassroots level and will grow up even keener to play for their country. Throw in a future Rugby World Cup on home soil and the so called “sleeping giant” of USA Rugby will be wide awake. My experiences at the Rugby World Cup in Japan 2019, not least playing against the Brave Blossoms, suggests there is a clear blueprint that USA must try to follow. Grow a successful internal rugby competition where local talent grows. Develop an international squad capable of gaining results on the big stage. Do all this in front of the American public’s eyes and attune the sport to the modern world and who knows just how high the sport could soar? The Rugby World Cups of 2031 and 2033 could be off the charts.",Sport/Sport,"We can build it, they will come: a USA Rugby World Cup will be a gamechanger | Will Hooley",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/12/we-can-build-it-they-will-come-a-usa-rugby-world-cup-will-be-a-gamechanger
5/12/2022,"Hello Fight to Vote readers, Every Tuesday night for the last year or so, Crystal Mason has had trouble sleeping. On Wednesday mornings, the Texas court of criminal appeals, the state’s highest criminal court, usually issues its ruling. And since March of last year, Mason has been waiting for a ruling from the court that could change her life. She’s been appealing a five-year prison sentence for voting a provisional ballot in 2016. Mason was ineligible to vote at the time because she was on federal supervised release – which is like probation – for a tax felony. Texas prohibits anyone from voting while they are serving a criminal sentence, but she says – and probation officials have confirmed – that no one told her she was ineligible. Yesterday, Mason, who is 47-years-old and raised seven kids and has six grandchildren, got the phone call she’s been anxiously waiting for. In an 8-1 ruling, the court told a lower court it had to reconsider the case to determine whether Mason actually knew she was ineligible to vote when she cast a ballot. It was a partial, but far from final, victory for Mason. I’ve been following Mason’s case for the last few years, and on Wednesday, I spoke with Mason hours after the ruling. We talked about about her case and why she thinks it’s struck a nerve across the US. How are you feeling, and what was it like to get the news this morning? I was at work and Kim [Mason’s lawyer] called me … She said the decision came in. I just started to panic, I started to sweat, like nervous, like, ‘What’s going on, Kim?’ She let me know that it’s going back to the second court of appeals and they have to prove intent. Like where I really knew that I was committing a crime. And I feel like that’s a good step. That’s a good step right there. If you go off facts and facts alone, Sam, you know that the supervised release officer testified on the stand and said no one told me [I couldn’t vote] in the supervised release office. Then I received paperwork in my judgment and commitment, and in black and white, it’s not there. And then you can see it in my supervised release information, it was not there. I think that the criminal court of appeals asked them something very important. That needs to be … that’s the whole case, right there. I’m very happy that they did that. But I know this is not over. You were never told, never had any idea, being on federal supervised release, that you couldn’t vote in Texas? Absolutely not. I was never told that. I never had any paperwork stating that. I was going by all my conditions of being on supervised release, and I did not see that at all. I do know that as a felon you still have the right to vote. I had no idea that being on supervised release took that right away from me. There’s no way … I’m on track. I got a good job. I’m making decent money. I’m in school. I’m back with my family, my kids, my grandbabies. You wouldn’t have ever taken a chance, if there was even a grey line, of me thinking that I was ineligible to vote. I just wouldn’t have did that. You just don’t. This has been a disaster for me. The jobs that I have lost. Me going back to prison [Mason was ordered to return to federal prison for 10 months for being convicted of a crime while on supervised release], leaving my kids. Me fighting to try to maintain everything. It’s been a disaster for me. There have been very significant consequences for you and your family. Can you walk me through what some of those consequences have been? I had to go back to prison. I had three jobs taken away from me. I fought to maintain my house and everything. And I am the provider for my family. You were not a political person in 2016. Not at all. And since then you’ve become political. Can you tell me a little bit about what you’ve been doing and what made you get more politically active? If you go back to my first interviews, you’ll hear me say ‘I’ll never vote again. I’ll never vote again.’ And that was it. And I realized that’s exactly what they wanted me to do. That’s exactly what they wanted me to say. I realized that no, I have to let everybody know that what I had done was an innocent mistake. And I am being prosecuted for an innocent mistake and that is not right. And then I had to let everybody know how important it is to go vote. Because the people that did this to me – the judge, the DA, the prosecutor – they’re all elected officials. So this is the reason why it’s so important that we get out and vote. And what has your group, Crystal Mason ‘The Fight’, been focused on? Has it been teaching people about their rights eligibility? Encouraging them to vote? All of the above? All of the above. Educating them on the different types of ballot. We’re getting ready to do a town hall. And that’s where we’re asking different candidates running for different positions to come to my venue and speak to the community. And let us know: who you are and what do you plan on doing if you get the seat you’re running for. I’ve traveled across the country, and almost everywhere I go, people have heard of that woman in Texas who was sentenced to five years in prison for trying to vote. I’m curious why you think your case has resonated so much and caused so much outrage? I think the people see the wrongness. The people that’s in the court system, the people that’s in a position to do something about it has turned a blind eye on it. I feel that people who hear the story and just really see, they know that I did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. Nothing at all. I filled out a provisional ballot. I’m being sentenced for illegally voting and I never voted. I mean that’s wrong right there. There are some people who have said your case is an example of intimidation. Sending a message to Black people, and people who have felony convictions in their past, that you better be really sure you can vote before you try. Do you see it as intimidation? Have you heard from other people who are not going to vote because they heard about what’s happened to you? I have heard that. That’s because people are scared. They’re listening to me, and I tell them ‘yep, I’m right here but I’m fighting and it’s very wrong.’ But people don’t want to take a chance. And yes, I do feel like my case is sending a message to the Black and the brown [people]: ‘If you dare come to the polls, this could happen to you’. So yes, I do feel like it’s sending a message. It is a scare tactic. And that’s not right, that’s not right at all. So that’s the reason I’m out here speaking to people and telling people how important it is to vote. And actually you voted in the primary, a couple months ago [Mason’s supervised release expired last year, allowing her to vote in Texas]. What was that like for you to go back to the voting booth and cast a ballot when you were eligible? It was very exciting. I was with my family, and the things that I didn’t know [before], I knew. So once I finished up with my ballot, I automatically went to go help my mother. And of course I got stopped and they said, ‘Oh no, you can’t.’ I told her … I can help her. I had to fill out a form, and they notarized it and everything. I turned around and I went to help my mom and I helped my niece. So I felt real good about being knowledgable about being able to help them through that ballot. Is there anything you hope people take away from your case? What do you hope people will learn from your case and take away from it. The importance of voting. Everybody that has something to do with my case are elected officials.",News/US news,Crystal Mason on a ruling that could change her life: 'I know this is not over’ | The fight to vote,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/12/crystal-mason-texas-court-ruling-fight-to-vote
5/12/2022,"Trump officials “collaborated” with the meatpacking industry to downplay the threat of Covid to plant workers and block public health measures which could have saved lives, a damning new investigation has found. Internal documents reviewed by the congressional Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis reveal how industry representatives lobbied government officials to stifle “pesky” health departments from imposing evidence-based safety measures to curtail the virus spreading – and tried to obscure worker deaths from these authorities. At least 59,000 workers at five of the largest meatpacking companies – Tyson Foods, JBS USA Holdings, Smithfield Foods, Cargill, and National Beef Packing Company which are the subject of the congressional inquiry – contracted Covid in the first year of the pandemic, of whom at least 269 died. According to internal communications, the companies were warned about workers and their families falling sick within weeks of the virus hitting the US. Despite this, company representatives enlisted industry-friendly Trump appointees at the USDA to fight their battles against Covid regulations and oversight. In addition, company executives intentionally stoked fears about meat shortages in order to justify continuing to operate the plants under dangerous conditions. The fears were baseless – there were no meat shortages in the US, while exports to China hit record highs. Yet in April 2020, Trump issued an executive order invoking the Defense Production Act to keep meat plants open following a flurry of communication between the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, the vice president’s office, USDA allies and company executives. The order, which was proposed by JBS and Tyson (whose legal department also wrote the draft), was an overt attempt to override health departments and force meat plant workers – who are mostly immigrants, refugees and people of color – to keep working without adequate protections while shielding the industry from lawsuits. James Clyburn, chairman of the subcommittee, condemned the conduct of the industry executives and their government allies as “shameful”. “Trump’s political appointees at USDA collaborated with large meatpacking companies to lead an administration-wide effort to force workers to remain on the job during the coronavirus crisis despite dangerous conditions, and even to prevent the imposition of commonsense mitigation measures. This coordinated campaign prioritized industry production over the health of workers and communities, and contributed to tens of thousands of workers becoming ill, hundreds of workers dying, and the virus spreading throughout surrounding areas.” The meatpacking industry, which includes slaughterhouses and processing plants - is one of the most profitable and dangerous in the US. It is a monopoly business, with just a handful of powerful multinationals dominating the supply chain which, even before Covid, was bad news for farmers, workers, consumers and animal welfare. As Covid spread, the industry was warned about the high risk of transmission in their plants. For example, a doctor near the JBS facility in Cactus, Texas, wrote to a company executive in April 2020 saying “100% of all Covid-19 patients we have in the hospital are either direct employees or family member[s] of your employees”, warning that “your employees will get sick and may die if this factory continues to be open”. In late May 2020 – well after the importance of prevention measures such as testing, social distancing, and personal protective equipment was widely recognized – an executive told an industry lobbyist that temperature screening was “all we should be doing”. The lobbyist agreed, replying “Now to get rid of those pesky health departments!” The report, Now to get rid of those pesky healthy departments!, reveals how USDA Trump appointees did the industry’s bidding in order to carry on with business as usual. The report is based on more than 151,000 pages of documents collected from meatpacking companies and interest groups, as well as interviews with meatpacking workers, former USDA and CDC officials, and state and local health authorities among others. The documents show that: In March 2020, the industry aggressively lobbied USDA officials, who in turn escalated their wishes to former vice-president Mike Pence’s office, to ensure states were advised to designate meatpacking workers as “critical infrastructure” employees who could be exempt from social distancing and stay at home orders. This conduct was “particularly egregious considering that the nation’s meat supply was not actually at risk”, the subcommittee found. Mindy Brashears, the undersecretary of food safety, was considered the go-to fixer, who could stop health departments enforcing Covid safety measures at local plants. Brashears “hasn’t lost a battle for us”, said one lobbyist. Career USDA staff told the congressional subcommittee how they were sidelined, while Brashears and her deputies communicated with industry officials on their personal phones in order to avoid leaving a paper trail. Meatpacking companies also successfully lobbied USDA officials to advocate for Department of Labor policies that deprived their employees of benefits if they missed work or quit, while also seeking insulation from legal liability if workers then fell ill or died. As reports of Covid clusters at meatpacking plants increased, industry officials and the USDA jointly lobbied the White House to dissuade frightened workers from staying home or quitting. For instance in April 2020 the CEOs of JBS, Smithfield and Tyson among other companies asked the secretary of agriculture Sonny Perdue during a call to “elevate the need for messaging about the importance of our workforce staying at work to the POTUS or VP level”. It worked. At a press briefing soon after, Mike Pence told meatpacking workers that “we need you to continue … to show up and do your job”, admonishing recent “incidents of worker absenteeism”. The report concludes: “Meatpacking companies knew the risk posed by the coronavirus to their workers and knew it wasn’t a risk that the country needed them to take. They nonetheless lobbied aggressively – successfully enlisting USDA as a close collaborator in their efforts – to keep workers on the job in unsafe conditions, to ensure state and local health authorities were powerless to mandate otherwise, and to be protected against legal liability for the harms that would result.” The trade association for meat and poultry packers and processors rejected the report’s findings and accused the subcommittee of “cherry-picking data”. “The report ignores the rigorous and comprehensive measures companies enacted to protect employees and support their critical infrastructure workers,” said Julie Anna Potts, president and CEO of the North American Meat Institute. “The meat and poultry industry, like many industries, was challenged by the pandemic in the spring of 2020. As more became known about the spread of the virus, the meat industry spent billions of dollars to reverse the pandemic’s trajectory, protecting meat and poultry workers while keeping food on Americans’ tables and our farm economy working.” In addition, a spokesperson for JBS said the company “did everything possible to ensure the safety of our people who kept our critical food supply chain running”. In a statement Cargill said: “We’ve worked hard to maintain safe and consistent operations to feed families during the pandemic, yet we did not hesitate to temporarily idle or reduce capacity at processing plants in the interest of our employees’ wellbeing.” The subcommittee investigation into the meatpacking industry’s response to the pandemic was launched in February 2021 following reports that meat companies had refused to take adequate safety measures precautions to protect workers during the first year of the pandemic. Last year, the subcommittee found that the illness and death toll at plants owned by the five big meatpackers had been grossly underestimated, and that the companies put profits over worker safety.

5/12/2022,"The UK has dropped down the annual ranking of LGBTQ+ rights across Europe for the third year running, with organisers citing the government’s failure to fully deliver long-awaited reforms on conversion practices and gender recognition. The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA), which produces a yearly “rainbow map” of 49 countries across Europe, revealed on Thursday that the UK – which led the table in 2015 – had the most significant drop in ranking, falling from 10th to 14th place. ILGA-Europe’s advocacy director, Katrin Hugendubel, described the UK’s plunging status as “a sad reminder that when governments don’t stand strong on their commitments to advance minority rights, a powerful opposition can use that space to spread hate and division”. The chief executive of Stonewall, Nancy Kelley, warned that “years of progress on LGBTQ+ policy that was achieved under successive administrations has been rapidly eroded by a UK government that has taken its foot off the pedal”. The ILGA highlighted the UK government’s failure to extend a ban on conversion practices to transgender people, as well as abandonment of promised reforms on gender recognition and its equality action plan. It added that the UK also lost points because the government’s equalities watchdog, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), was “not … effectively protecting on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity”. The EHRC recently published controversial guidance stating that transgender people could be legitimately excluded from single-sex services if the reasons were “justifiable and proportionate”, and called on the Scottish government to pause its own plans to streamline the gender recognition process. The EHRC has been approached for comment. Kelley said: “While the governments of both Scotland and Wales push forward in their goal of being LGBTQ+ inclusive countries, the UK government is dragging us rapidly down the international rankings.” She called on the prime minister to “step back into the game” as a leader in protecting and promoting LGBTQ+ rights. “As we approach the 50th anniversary of the first Pride in the UK, we call for his active leadership to rebuild our human rights institutions and to deliver a strategic policy programme that enables all LGBTQ+ people in the UK to live their lives in freedom and safety.” A UK government Equality Hub spokesperson said the UK had “one of the world’s most comprehensive and robust legislative protection frameworks for LGBT people.“We have been very clear that we will protect people from the abhorrent practice of conversion therapy by bringing forward legislation to ban it. Alongside this we have reduced the cost of applying for a gender recognition certification and moved the process of applying online, whilst extending same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland.”",News/World news,UK falls down Europe’s LGBTQ+ rights ranking for third year running,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/uk-falls-down-europes-lgbtq-rights-ranking-for-third-year-running
5/12/2022,"A “death match” wrestling contest in which a bloodied performer attacked his rival with a garden strimmer in front of children is being investigated by health and safety officers. Police in Durham said they were working with the local council to investigate complaints about the show at the Conservative Club in Seaham. A video of the event, circulated online, shows children watching a blood-covered wrestler in his underpants using an electric lawn strimmer to cut his opponent, Ronnie Thatcher. Someone watching says: “A strimmer is for cutting grass, not Ronnie Thatcher.” Colliery Championship Wrestling (CCW), which promotes themed events based on the north-east’s mining heritage, offered discounted family tickets for the event on 29 April. The posters made no mention that the show would include a so-called “death match”, which involves weapons. James Barrass, CCW’s promoter, told BBC Tees that the match “escalated”. “Things can kinda sometimes not always go to plan. Obviously there was a little bit more that went down,” he told the BBC. “I spoke to the two guys afterwards. We had discussions and obviously that will not be happening again.” He admitted the event “wasn’t everyone’s cup of tea”, adding: “We have apologised, but how many times do you say sorry? How many times do you have to be penalised in life?” Benji, a Teesside-based wrestler, said while so-called death matches were popular in some contexts, they were inappropriate for children to witness. “I’ve never seen this in my time in wrestling,” he told the BBC. “I’ve been involved for seven years and I’ve never seen this type of ultraviolence in front of a family audience.” He said he did not believe a death match could take place without having been planned. Barrass, 25, told the BBC he would promote similar events in future but only sell tickets to over-18s. Joanne Waller, Durham county council’s head of community protection, said: “We can confirm we have been made aware of concerns about a wrestling event at New Seaham Conservative Club on 29 April. Our licensing and health and safety teams are currently investigating and it would be inappropriate to comment further while these enquiries are ongoing.” A Durham constabulary spokesperson said: “We are working with Durham county council’s licensing team after a number of complaints were received by the local authority in relation to an event at Seaham Conservative Club on April 29. Enquiries are ongoing.”",News/UK news,Wrestling ‘death match’ in Durham investigated over strimmer violence,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/12/wrestling-death-match-in-durham-investigated-over-strimmer-violence
5/12/2022,"Israel has approved 2,700 housing units in illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank, and advanced plans for another 1,600, a military body has said, a move likely to displease Washington before an expected visit to the region next month by the US president, Joe Biden. An Israeli Civil Administration subcommittee meeting on Thursday approved the building plans and retroactively “legalised” two outposts in Area C, the 60% of the West Bank under full Israeli control. The news came a day after the Israeli military demolished Palestinian homes in an area where about 1,000 people face the threat of eviction to make way for a military training zone. Since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, approximately 600,000 to 750,000 Jewish settlers have moved to live on land in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank. The practice is considered by most of the international community to be illegal, and a major impediment to achieving lasting peace. Under Israeli law, outposts are defined as settlements built without authorisation from the Israeli government. Settler communities are granted permission to build permanent structures connected to the electrical grid and water supply, while building permits for Palestinians living alongside them are almost always denied. Many Palestinians live under the constant threat of eviction, and face a rising tide of settler violence designed to displace them from their homes. Thursday’s batch of approvals is the biggest advancement of settlement plans since Biden took office. During Donald Trump’s administration, there was a 150% growth in settlement compared with during Barack Obama’s second term. Biden’s White House, however, is opposed to settlements, which it says undercut the viability of a two-state solution. Israeli officials have denied local media reports that Washington had conditioned the US president’s June visit on there being no new announcements of settlement construction. There was no immediate comment from the Palestinians or the US on the settlement approvals. They came on the heels of Wednesday’s demolition of Palestinian homes and structures in Masafer Yatta, a cluster of villages in an area south of Hebron that Israel has designated as a military training zone. After a two-decade legal dispute, Israel’s high court said last week that about 1,000 Palestinians in Masafer Yatta could be evicted. The ruling is one of the single biggest expulsion decisions since the occupation began. Israel’s ideologically diverse government, which was sworn in last June, encompasses leftists who oppose settlement building; rightwingers, such as the prime minister, Naftali Bennett, who previously led a settler lobbying group; and, for the first time, members of an Arab party. Initially united by their desire to remove from office the longtime former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and end four years of political turmoil, an agreement to focus on areas of common ground in governance faltered when it came to the occupation. The opening of the Knesset’s summer session this week was hit by immediate turbulence. The ruling coalition recently lost its already narrow majority, while a wave of violence – much of it focused on Jerusalem’s sensitive al-Aqsa compound – led the United Arab List, or Ra’am, faction to suspend its cooperation. The Ra’am leader, Mansour Abbas, said on Wednesday that his party had for now decided to continue its partnership with the government for the benefit of Israel’s Palestinian minority of 2 million people, thwarting opposition initiatives this week to pass no-confidence votes in the Knesset.",News/World news,"Israel approves 2,700 housing units in illegal West Bank settlements",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/israel-approves-2700-housing-units-in-west-bank-settlements
5/12/2022,"Urgent measures to break the Russian blockade of grain exports from Ukraine’s ports, including by trying to open routes through Romanian and Baltic ports, will be discussed by G7 foreign and agriculture ministers at meetings in Germany. The grain exports blockade is fast becoming one of the most urgent diplomatic and humanitarian crises in Ukraine. On Tuesday, the US president, Joe Biden, said the US was working on solutions “to get this food out into the world so that it could help bring down prices.” G7 foreign ministers are meeting in the Baltic Sea resort of Weissenhaus north-east of Hamburg, and the agriculture ministers in Stuttgart. Cem Özdemir, the German agriculture minister and a Green party member, has for months been looking with the EU at alternative train routes through Poland and Belarus to Baltic ports, but the different train gauges between Ukraine and Poland, a pre-existing backlog of traffic and the shortage of suitable rail wagons all count against this option. By one Ukrainian estimate, only 20% of the exports Ukraine normally sent through the Black Sea ports by ship could ever be transported by rail to the Baltic ports. The cost of road transport has risen five-fold in the past year. Before the war, most of the food produced by Ukraine – enough to feed 400 million people – was exported through the country’s seven Black Sea ports. In the eight months before the conflict began, close to 51 million metric tonnes of grain passed through them, according to the UN World Food Programme. The trade was worth $47bn (£38bn) a year to Ukraine. The Ukrainian minister of agricultural policy and food, Mykola Solsky, has studied options ranging from Gdansk or further east to the port in Klaipėda in Lithuania and three ports in Latvia. The Baltic ports have lost trade from Russia and Belarus, including of potash, so currently have spare capacity. The Romanian port of Constanța has also taken some shipments of Ukrainian grain, but ships then carrying the grain towards Turkey would probably need to stay within Romanian waters. The UN has also discussed whether a humanitarian corridor can be opened through Belarus to take the grain to the Baltic ports since the track gauge between Ukraine and Belarus is uniform. The UN World Food Programme’s David Beasley, who has been sounding the alarm for weeks, warned: “Right now, Ukraine’s grain silos are full. At the same time, 44 million people around the world are marching towards starvation. We have to open up these ports so that food can move in and out of Ukraine. The world demands it because hundreds of millions of people globally depend on food that comes through these ports.” Typically, Ukraine would export around 5 to 6 million tonnes of grain and 700,000 tonnes of oilseeds through the Black Sea ports a month. There is an estimated backlog for export of anything between 15 and 20m tonnes according to the Ukrainian Agribusiness Club. Markiyan Dmytrasevych, Ukraine’s designated deputy agrarian minister, said exports by rail could be expanded to between 600,000 tonnes to 1 million tonnes, but that it would take 18-24 months to clear the current inventories, and that’s before any new crop has been added. In April only 560,000 metric tonnes were exported by rail from Ukraine. Roman Slaston, director general of the Ukrainian Agribusiness Club, said reopening the ports – “Plan A” - remains the best option, but exports by road, river barges and rail trucks could be doubled to approximately half what was going through the Ukrainian Black Sea ports. The greatest potential for growth, he said, would come from organising an army of as many as 10,000 trucks transporting grain on a five day round trip from Ukraine to Baltic ports. He said 40 EU grain terminals could be used by Ukraine. Slaston said as many as 5,000 train wagons loaded with grain at the Polish border were waiting to cross, but currently there was only capacity to bring 350 wagons per day over. After the port city of Odesa was struck by Russian missiles on Monday, Ukraine’s president Volodymr Zelenskiy warned: “Without our agricultural exports, dozens of countries in different parts of the world are already on the brink of food shortages. The poorest will be hit the hardest. The political repercussions of this will be terrible.” David Miliband, the International Rescue Committee chief executive, said: “At the moment, I think it’s at least equally likely that the sanctions on Russia get the blame for the rising food prices as does the invasion of Ukraine. There is a huge contest to be won for public opinion globally.” Signs already exist that Russian diplomacy is trying to shift the blame. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, claimed on a visit to Oman that Ukrainian authorities were refusing to let ships carrying wheat out of their ports and had mined the areas around ports. Ukraine said the accusations were absurd. In 2020, Ukraine was the world’s fifth-largest exporter of wheat, with low- and middle-income countries being important beneficiaries. The main export destinations were Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Lebanon. In Egypt, where a third of the population lives below the official poverty line and relies on state-subsidised bread, flour prices have risen by 15%. General inflation for April was just over 13%. In the month after the conflict started, export prices for wheat and maize rose by 22% and 20% respectively, on top of steep rises in 2021. Solsky said these rises were likely to continue since Ukrainian farmers’ sowing campaign has been delayed by as much as a fifth because of a lack of herbicides, colder weather, diesel fuel and the movement of vehicles because of curfews. Farmers have switched from spring crops to sunflower and soya beans. It is estimated that about a fifth of Ukrainian agricultural land is now in Russian hands.",News/World news,G7 to discuss action to break Russian blockade of Ukraine grain exports,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/russian-blockade-grain-exports-ukraine-ports-g7
5/12/2022,"Amnesty International has criticised Greg Norman for “wrong and seriously misguided” comments about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi Arabian consulate in 2018 and the high number of executions carried out this year by the kingdom. Norman, the chief executive of Saudi-backed LIV Golf Investments, was asked about Khashoggi’s death during promotional work in the UK for an upcoming tournament. Last year US intelligence agencies concluded that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, had approved Khashoggi’s murder. The LIV Golf Series gets underway in Hertfordshire in June. Norman had said: “This whole thing about Saudi Arabia and Khashoggi and human rights; talk about it, but also talk about the good that the country is doing in changing its culture. Look, we’ve all made mistakes and you just want to learn by those mistakes and how you can correct them going forward.” Pressed on the execution of 81 men in Saudi Arabia in March, Norman added: “I got a lot of messages but quite honestly I look forward. I don’t look back. I don’t look into the politics of things. I’m not going to get into the quagmire of whatever else happens in someone else’s world. I heard about it and just kept moving on.” Felix Jakens, Amnesty UK’s head of campaigns, told the Guardian: “Greg Norman’s remarks that the Saudi government’s brutal murder of Khashoggi and its attempted cover-up were a ‘mistake’ are wrong and seriously misguided. Far from trying to ‘move on’, the Saudi authorities have attempted to sweep their crimes under the carpet, avoiding justice and accountability at every turn. “The regime’s human rights record is an abomination – from its murder of Khashoggi to recent mass executions and the situation for LGBTI+ people, which continues to be dire. “The LIV Golf Invitational Series is yet one more event in a series of sportswashing exercises that the Saudi authorities are using to clean its blood-soaked image. Everyone involved in any of the sports events held there, or that are sponsored by Saudi Arabia, must be aware of what is going on in the kingdom and speak out about the government’s brazen abuses.” Phil Mickelson, Lee Westwood, Sergio García and Ian Poulter are among those who are due to feature at LIV’s tournament at the Centurion Club in Hertfordshire next month.

5/12/2022,"MI6’s ethics chief has argued that spies cannot justify their existence with moral arguments alone and must accept they exist to “promote the national interest” in a struggle as “potent now as it was during the cold war”. The frank argument is made in a review of a book, Spying Through a Glass Darkly, a discussion of the ethics of espionage, which argues that the entirely values-based justification for spying advanced by the author is too restrictive. The ethics counsellor says that while “one hopes that most people in the UK would agree that we want to live in a world where fundamental rights are respected”, the reality is that intelligence agencies are tasked “to defend the national interest for its own sake”. In common with service tradition the MI6 officer is not named, but the book review, which appeared in the Times Literary Supplement, was tweeted out approvingly by MI6 chief, Richard Moore, on Thursday. “Every day the outstanding intelligence professionals of MI6 take the difficult decisions needed to keep our country safe,” Moore said, adding that “ethical principles infuse” its operations, “marking our difference from our adversaries”. In the book, the author Cecile Fabre writes that “espionage in the service of an unjust foreign policy is generally not justified”, and argues that as a result there remains “a moral asymmetry between intelligence agents on different sides of a conflict”. To support her argument, Fabre compares two famous spies – Oleg Gordievsky, a KGB officer who spied for and defected to the UK, and Kim Philby, the famous “Third Man” who worked for MI6 but passed secrets to the Soviet Union. Fabre writes that Gordievsky “did have pretty good evidence” that Britain “would make morally justified use of the information he was able to provide them” based on “Britain’s relatively democratic traditions, commitment to the rule of law etc.” Philby, however, “had no such evidence” that the Soviet authorities would do the same – if anything, they would act “on the contrary” – which in Fabre’s view marked “a morally crucial difference between their two acts of treason”. Yet although this comparison is favourable to the British perspective, the MI6 reviewer argues it is simplistic and does not take into account the world of realpolitik that all spies must inhabit in their secret work. “All foreign policy has to balance values and interests; without the former it is morally derelict, but the idea that one can ignore the latter is an illusion,” the ethics chief writes. Spies must know “which side we are on” and “what we are prepared to fight for”, the ethics chief writes, arguing that the threat from countries such as Russia and China has reached a pitch last seen before the fall of the Berlin Wall. “Those of us working in the intelligence community have to accept that we are engaged in a struggle that is as potent now as it was during the cold war,” the MI6 officer adds. But they stress that does not mean each side is prepared to use the same tactics. Three are “significant differences” in the way that British agents operate compared with Russian, Chinese and other adversaries, and it is “not hard to make the case that, while some methods are morally acceptable, others definitely are not,” the officer adds. The review author is MI6’s in-house ethics counsellor – one of three working for each of Britain’s main spy agencies – the domestic service MI5, the signals agency GCHQ and the foreign intelligence agency MI6. The job is to act as a point of contact for any officer who has “a concern of an ethical nature,” champion “open internal discussion of matters that are inherently problematic from an ethical perspective” and foster “a culture of challenge, including, if necessary, to the leadership.”",News/UK news,"Moral arguments alone not enough to justify spying, says MI6 ethics chief",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/12/moral-arguments-alone-not-enough-to-justify-spying-says-mi6-ethics-chief
5/12/2022,"Rishi Sunak has said he is “pragmatic” about the idea of introducing a windfall tax on energy companies, insisting “no options are off the table,” in the latest hint the government may be preparing fresh measures to tackle the cost of living crisis. Labour has been calling for a windfall tax on the oil giants, which have benefited from rocketing global prices, with shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, suggesting the proceeds be used to cut domestic energy bills. Both Sunak and the prime minister, Boris Johnson, had previously suggested such a tax would disincentivise investment in the North Sea. They appear to be warming to the idea, however, amid intense pressure to do more to help hard-pressed households weather surging inflation. It is understood Treasury officials are working up possible options. Sunak told the BBC in an interview on Thursday that he was “not naturally attracted to windfall taxes in general,” but was “pragmatic about it”. “These companies are making a significant amount of profit at the moment because of these very elevated prices. What I want to see is significant investment back in the UK economy to support jobs, to support energy security, and I want to see that soon. If that doesn’t happen, then no options are off the table.” Sunak had already hinted at a shift in his position in a Mumsnet interview last week. Business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, is known to be less enthusiastic about the idea, however, saying, “I think it discourages investment.” Boris Johnson appeared to echo that view on Thursday, telling LBC: “The disadvantage with those sorts of taxes is that they deter investment in the very things that they need to be investing in – new technology, in new energy supply.” He did not rule out such a measure, however. Shadow environment secretary, Ed Miliband, said: “The case for a windfall tax on the oil and gas giants making record profits whilst energy bills spiral for working people has been clear since Labour first proposed it in January. The Conservatives have opposed it at every turn. “Now, as their excuses are wearing thin, we hear that they are finally considering it. But how much more time does this government need to make up its mind, whilst the British people suffer?” Chief executive of BP, Bernard Looney, has insisted his company’s investment plans would not be affected by a windfall tax. The chair of Tesco, John Allan, added his voice to calls for a windfall tax earlier this week, as did senior Conservative backbencher Robert Halfon. Allan said: “I think there’s an overwhelming case for a windfall tax on profits from those energy producers, fed back to those most in need of help with energy prices. I think that would be the single biggest thing that could be done.” Sunak’s spring statement in March included several significant tax cuts, including an increase in the national insurance threshold that partly offset the impact of the health and social care levy. But he was criticised for failing to do enough for the poorest. A recent survey by the Food Foundation thinktank found that more than 2million adults had gone without food for an entire day in the past month, because they could not afford to eat. Sunak has said he wants to wait until the Treasury has more information about how sharply energy prices are set to rise in the autumn, before taking more action. But he dropped a heavy hint on Thursday that fresh measures are coming, telling Sky News he was, “ready to do more”. “I know these are anxious times, and because the challenges we face are global in nature, I can’t just make them all disappear. But where we can make a difference of course we are, and that’s why we’re investing billions of pounds already to support families and businesses through some of the challenging times ahead,” he said.

5/12/2022,"Everyone deserves to be treated fairly at work. But too many women find themselves discriminated against by their employer because they are pregnant. Many are pushed out of work because they have caring responsibilities for their children or elderly parents, and many still experience sexual harassment at work. Three years ago, the government promised to publish an employment bill that would extend redundancy protections to prevent pregnancy and maternity discrimination, and allow parents to take extended paid leave when newborns need neonatal care. Ministers have promised – no less than 20 times – to publish the bill. But the government has since abandoned this promise. The Conservatives are failing working women once again. I know only too well the challenges of trying to balance work with being a good mum. Care is the root of much of the discrimination women face, whether that’s through becoming a mother, caring for relatives or simply trying to balance childcare around inflexible work. I cared for my own mother from the age of 10, and became a parent aged only 16. I know the realities, the challenges and the difference that support can make when you need it. The employment bill is also a lost opportunity to ensure women are safe and protected in their jobs. The government promised to make employers responsible for preventing sexual harassment and to strengthen protections against third-party harassment. I’ve seen at first hand how sexism is still rampant in the workplace. After my own recent experience of sexism and misogyny, the number of women who have been in touch with me from across the country attests to how widespread these experiences are – from everyday, routine sexism to the most disturbing forms of abuse. This bill was the product of a commitment the government made in 2019 to reform redundancy protections and help keep pregnant women and new mothers in work. It represented the entirety of ministers’ response to a 2016 finding from the Equality and Human Rights Commission that pregnancy and maternity discrimination is rife in Britain’s workplaces. More than five years after those words, women are still waiting for action. Without legislation, we are at risk of turning back the progress women have made in the workplace. Many women now face growing economic uncertainty. Single-parent households are among the most exposed to the cost of living crisis, with savings pots 20 times smaller than the UK average. This crisis has also exacerbated period poverty, leaving women unable to afford even basic essentials. While food bank use has surged, Conservative MPs are busy blaming people’s cooking skills. Tory ministers may not know what it’s like to be a single parent when your fridge-freezer breaks down and you don’t have the cash to go out and just buy a new one. The employment bill would have given fast-track protection against sexual harassment. But the promise to tackle it in the workplace now looks set to fall by the wayside. For all Boris Johnson’s claims to be an ally in the fight against sexism, his record speaks otherwise. I’m still waiting to hear why an award for “sexist of the year” was given out at one of his law-breaking lockdown parties in Downing Street. Celebrating and rewarding sexism is symbolic of a rotten culture, and sets an appalling example to employers. Rather than stacking the odds against working parents, Labour would extend statutory maternity and paternity leave, introduce the right to bereavement leave, and strengthen protections for pregnant women by making it unlawful, as a default, to dismiss a woman who is pregnant for six months after her return. We would also introduce paid family and carer’s leave. Our plans would ensure all workers have the right to flexible working as a default from day one, with employers required to accommodate this as soon as reasonably possible. Many of the women I speak to are held back by the needless inflexibility that prevents them from juggling responsibilities. Ministers promised to make Britain the best place to work in the world. For working women, this claim sounds like yet another of Boris Johnson’s feeble jokes. By failing to deliver this employment bill, this government is failing working women. We all deserve better.

At Grinnell College in Iowa, undergraduate workers voted overwhelmingly, 327 to 6, to form the nation’s first wall-to-wall undergraduate workers union, representing everyone from dining hall workers to research assistants to library aides. At Dartmouth, student dining hall workers voted 52-0 to unionize. Workers at an REI store in Manhattan voted in favor of unionizing in an 88-14 landslide, becoming the first unionize REI vote. And now tech giant Apple is facing the first-ever union drive at its retail stores. In my 25 years writing about labor, I’ve never seen so much excitement about unions. For years, America’s labor leaders have struggled to figure out how to reverse the union movement’s decades-long decline, but to no avail. But thanks to two important, often unappreciated trends, unions have the best opportunity in decades to halt their slide. First, young workers are showing extraordinary enthusiasm about unions. Second, workers have embraced a long-neglected strategy, called self-organizing or bottom-up organizing that’s proving highly successful. With self-organizing, employees at a workplace, dissatisfied with their pay and working conditions, conclude that unionizing is a smart way to improve matters (and they’re often doing that with little or no help from large, established unions). Among young Americans there’s an undeniable surge of interest in unions. A study by professors at MIT and Columbia found that 74% of Americans aged 18 to 24 say they would vote to join a union if they could. This helps explain the recent landslide votes to unionize at many Starbucks, including tallies of 20-0, 17-0, 23-1 and 33-2. This also helps explain the victory at Amazon’s mammoth warehouse on Staten Island, where many key organizers were Amazon workers in their twenties. (The union lost, however, at a smaller Amazon sorting center on Staten Island). All this youthful excitement has fueled the unionization wave among thousands of grad student workers and adjunct professors as well as workers at tech companies, art museums, digital news sites, political campaigns and nonprofits like the Audubon Society and Friends of the Earth. Young workers are flocking to unions for numerous reasons. Many are overwhelmed by student debt and fast-rising housing costs. Many feel they’re being paid far less than they deserve at a time when corporate profits have soared. Many are frustrated to be told they will be the first generation in US history to do worse economically than their parents. Many have been inspired by Bernie Sanders, the Fight for $15, Black Lives Matter and/or #MeToo, and they’re raring to fight for a better world – and workplace. Unlike their parents and grandparents, today’s young workers came of age long after the era of horrendous Teamster and Longshoremen corruption that turned off so many Americans to unions. Remember the movie On the Waterfront? Today’s young workers also came of age after Ronald Reagan defeated the 1981 air traffic controllers’ strike and fired more than 11,000 of them – moves that made many workers nervous about unions. Today’s young workers have a more upbeat attitude about unions. The current burst of self-organizing also makes this an unusually promising moment for labor. Christian Smalls, the fired Amazon worker who spearheaded the winning drive on Staten Island, led a classic self-organizing effort – he co-founded a new, independent union, used GoFundMe to raise the $120,000 spent on the campaign, and relied on 15 Amazon workers as the main organizers. The self-organizing we’ve seen at Amazon and Starbucks has some big advantages over traditional organizing drives run by paid union staffers. Self-organizing excites workers because they see that it’s led by their co-workers, people they know (rather than by union staffers they don’t know). Self-organizing effectively neutralizes one of corporate America’s favorite anti-union arguments – that unions are an outside third party. Workers who self-organize have a powerful response: “How can you say we’re outsiders? We work here. We know the problems workers face here.” In addition, workers who lead self-organizing efforts do not face a major obstacle to most unionization drives: unlike paid union staff organizers, they can’t be barred from company property – they work there and can easily talk up the union with their co-workers. Today’s youth-fueled union drives are the most promising thing to come along for labor in years, but they often lack resources. These union drives badly need more money and lawyers not just to help them succeed against intense anti-union efforts, but to go to scale across the US – and perhaps try to spread unionization fever from Starbucks to McDonalds, Chipotle and other fast-food companies and from Amazon to Walmart, Target and other retailers. This is a critical opportunity – and moment – for America’s labor leaders. For today’s unionization surge to become a lasting, powerful movement that transforms decades of decline into increased membership and power, labor leaders will need to step up and provide money, lots of it, to help the current efforts succeed and spread. Christian Smalls says workers at 100 other Amazon facilities have contacted him to say that they, too, want to unionize. But it will take money to fertilize those efforts and to send Smalls and his fellow organizers to dozens of other Amazon warehouses to explain how to do successful self-organizing. Those campaigns will also need lawyers to file the paperwork to request union elections and to lodge complaints with the government if and when companies fire union supporters illegally. Many labor leaders might hesitate to back today’s burst of self-organizing because they won’t control those efforts and won’t get the members and the dues money resulting from them. But if labor leaders are serious about ending decades of decline and about strengthening unions to win a better deal for workers, they need to jettison their old-style thinking and provide money and lawyers to help today’s union surge grow and then grow some more. If they don’t do this, it will show that all their talk about reversing labor’s decline is empty rhetoric. With their energy and idealism, the kids – the young workers – are all right. But with their inertia and lack of imagination, many of today’s older unions seem inexplicably reluctant to seize – and build on – this promising moment for labor. Labor’s hot hand is with young workers and self-organized shops. Union leaders need to take note, adjust their model and get on board.
