5/10/2022,"The Liberal candidate Katherine Deves has walked back her apology for offensive comments about transgender children, insisting that “mutilation” is the correct terminology for gender reassignment surgery. The Liberal candidate for Warringah, who has spent much of the campaign dodging the media, made the comments to Sky News on Monday – reframing her apology as limited to how people “might have perceived” her earlier anti-trans advocacy. Deves came under scrutiny in the early phase of the federal election campaign for social media comments describing trans children as “surgically mutilated and sterilised” and likening anti-trans activism to standing up against the Holocaust. She then said in a statement that her “language has on occasion been unacceptable”. “It has hurt people and detracted from my arguments,” she said. “I apologise for such language and the hurt that I have caused. I commit to continuing the fight for the safety of girls and women in a respectful way.” Asked on Monday about use of the term “mutilation” to describe surgery on teenagers, Deves replied: “Look, that is actually the correct medico-legal term.” “It’s very emotive, it’s very confronting and it’s very ugly so of course people are going to be offended. But when you look at medical negligence cases, that is the terminology they use – it is also contained in the Crimes Act of NSW.” Asked to clarify if this meant she was not apologising for use of that language, Deves explained: “I’m apologising for how people might have perceived it, and the fact that it is confronting, and it is ugly, and I certainly don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings. But that is the correct terminology.” LGBTQ advocates were quick to point out Deves’ contributions were offensive not just in the terms they’re expressed, but for factual inaccuracies about the availability of gender reassignment surgery: Children are not getting “gender reassignment surgery”.“Gender reassignment surgery” is not performed on or available to teenagers under 18 in Aus.This is completely ridiculous https://t.co/8frBLcfc5L In April, Deves told SBS news she had been “chastened” by the reaction to her tweets but she also appeared to blame the social media platform for her own inflammatory comments. “I recognise that trying to prosecute arguments on complex, difficult and nuanced subjects should not take place on a platform that propagates offence and division and hurt,” she said. “And going forward, I will be conducting myself within a dignified and respectful fashion.” Scott Morrison, who handpicked Deves to run just weeks out from the start of the campaign, has repeatedly defended the Warringah candidate by noting she had apologised for her remarks. On Sunday he told reporters: “Where Katherine has made insensitive remarks in the past … she’s regretted those.” On Saturday he said: “In terms of what Katherine Deves has said in the past, she has withdrawn those and she said they were insensitive. “And that was my view as well. So there’s no suggestion that I have supported those earlier comments. I don’t support those earlier comments.” The shadow infrastructure minister, Catherine King, told ABC News Breakfast it did not surprise her that Deves had walked back the apology. “I think this is an incredibly divisive debate and I think the prime minister has chosen a very divisive candidate to run in that seat and I think it’s really awful to see that happening in the context of a federal election campaign,” she said.",News/Australia news,Katherine Deves backtracks on apology for comments about transgender children,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/10/katherine-deves-backtracks-on-apology-for-comments-about-transgender-children
5/10/2022,"Boris Johnson’s government will force through police powers to prevent disruptive yet peaceful protests as one of 38 new bills in Tuesday’s Queen’s speech. In a move to reinstate measures thrown out by the House of Lords in January, the government will announce new offences to stop protesters from “locking on” to infrastructure, extend stop and search powers, and make it illegal to obstruct transport projects. The public order bill will be aimed at quashing tactics employed by protest groups such as Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain and Just Stop Oil. It will be seen as part of a plan by Johnson to boost his premiership with proposals which will appeal to core Tory supporters. The development came as Buckingham Palace announced on Monday night that the Queen will miss the state opening of parliament. The Prince of Wales will instead read the Queen’s speech for the first time on her behalf. In a move that will anger civil liberty groups, the new public order measures will include: New criminal offences of locking on, and going equipped to lock on to others, objects or buildings – carrying a maximum penalty of six months’ imprisonment and an unlimited fine. The creation of a new criminal offence of interfering with key national infrastructure, such as airports, railways and printing presses – carrying a maximum sentence of 12 months in prison and an unlimited fine. Measures to make it illegal to obstruct major transport works, including disrupting the construction or maintenance of projects like HS2 – punishable by up to six months in prison and an unlimited fine. The bill is expected to extend stop and search powers so the police can seize articles related to these new offences. New preventive “serious disruption prevention orders” will also be available for repeat offenders, a statement said. The home secretary, Priti Patel, first announced plans to disrupt the tactics of protesters last October at the Conservative party conference. But in January, peers rejected half a dozen government amendments to the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill which would have introduced the measures. Because the amendments were introduced in the House of Lords once the bill had passed through the Commons they could not be sent back to MPs. However, the latest plan will mean that the government can rely on its Commons majority to force through a new law. Commenting on the new measures, Patel said: “The public order bill will give the police the powers they need to clamp down on this outrageous behaviour and ensure the British public can go about their lives without disruption.” The programme includes seven bills intended to remove EU regulation, covering areas from data reform to gene editing and financial services. Other new laws are expected to try to boost economic growth across the country to address the cost of living crisis. The government will also try to create the conditions for more people to have high wage, high skilled jobs, and keep the public safe, a statement said. Announcing a “mission to deliver”, Johnson will say: “This Queen’s speech will get our country back on track, and I will strive – and this government will strive – night and day to deliver it. “Because in spite of everything we have been through, we are going to ensure that over the two years we have left in this parliament, we spend every second uniting and levelling up this country, exactly as we said we would.” Following Conservative backbench concerns over the cost of living crisis, the government is widely expected to make announcements on its energy strategy. Other expected announcements include changes to Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit border arrangements and a replacement for the Human Rights Act. Addressing cost of living challenges, Johnson is expected to say: “We will get the country through the aftershocks of Covid, just as we got through Covid, with every ounce of ingenuity and compassion and hard work. “By urgently pressing on with our mission to create the high wage, high skilled jobs that will drive economic growth across our whole United Kingdom.” Buckingham Palace said in a statement that the Queen, 96, has pulled out of the ceremonial occasion after experiencing “episodic mobility problems”. “At Her Majesty’s request, and with the agreement of the relevant authorities, the Prince of Wales will read the Queen’s speech on Her Majesty’s behalf, with the Duke of Cambridge also in attendance,” the statement said.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson to force through new anti-protest curbs in Queen’s speech,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/09/boris-johnson-to-force-through-new-anti-protest-curbs-in-queens-speech
5/10/2022,"Steven Gerrard has labelled the current Liverpool team the most satisfying to watch in the club’s history and insisted the thought of potentially scuppering their pursuit of the Premier League title and an unprecedented quadruple has not crossed his mind. Liverpool’s 1-1 draw with Tottenham on Saturday combined with Manchester City’s 5-0 victory against Newcastle the following day leaves Jürgen Klopp’s side three points behind the leaders and reigning champions with three games to play. They also have an inferior goal difference. Gerrard knows Villa will have to deliver the “perfect performance” when they host Liverpool on Tuesday, with the legendary former captain full of praise for Anfield’s latest team. “I think to watch they are probably the best, because of the speed, the intensity and the mentality of this current group,” Gerrard said. “But I say that without disrespecting previous successful Liverpool teams, because I grew up watching them, the European Cup winners, serial league title-winners, I grew up on all the DNA of that club. I’m well aware that they have had world-class players, managers and teams previously, but I think to watch – on the eye, because of the way the game has changed, it has gone quicker and faster – I think you’re probably watching the best Liverpool team there’s been.” Asked if he had played out in his head the scenario of possibly derailing Liverpool’s bid for the title, Gerrard replied: “Not really, no, and it didn’t when we competed against Burnley at the other end of the table last weekend [Villa won 3-1]. “Preparation is always about Aston Villa and preparing my team in the best way we can for whatever challenge faces us. Whoever I represent, I’ll go into the game wanting to win. The day I don’t have that urgency to win, I won’t be sitting in a seat like this.” Villa host Burnley in the penultimate game of their season before travelling to City on the final day. “The way the fixtures have fallen we can have a say in the title race – that is how it is,” Gerrard said. “We will try to win all of the games that are in front of us but we know Liverpool is going to be a massive challenge. “If the outcome is in our favour it would mean my team has gone above and beyond and performed extremely well. That is what it is going to take, to get the outcome we want, we need every single player at it, individually and collectively. There is no doubt about it, we need the perfect performance. That goes without saying. We also know that for us to achieve that we are going to have to probably post the best performance we have done so far.” Villa have accrued seven points from their past three matches and the game on Tuesday presents another opportunity to maintain their push for a top-half finish. “The first remit was to move the team into a safe place,” Gerrard said. “Top 10 would be a satisfactory end considering where we were when we took the job. We’re now in a place with four games left where there’s a possibility and that would be a huge positive considering the club hasn’t done it for a decade. That would give us a positive base to go and have a real strong pre-season from.” Jacob Ramsey will miss the game on Tuesday with a groin injury but the 18-year-old former Exeter midfielder Ben Chrisene, who played 90 minutes for Villa’s reserves on Friday, will return to the squad. Villa stunned Liverpool 7-2 in this fixture last season. Ollie Watkins scored a hat-trick and is again likely to start in attack.",Sport/Football,Aston Villa’s Steven Gerrard hails ‘best ever Liverpool team to watch’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/09/aston-villas-steven-gerrard-hails-best-ever-liverpool-team-to-watch
5/10/2022,"Jürgen Klopp has dismissed Pep Guardiola’s claim that the entire country wants Liverpool to win the title but insisted the Premier League would be boring without a serious rival to Manchester City. Guardiola claimed “everyone in this country supports Liverpool, the media and everyone” and “people want Liverpool to win more than us” in a bizarre outburst following City’s 5-0 rout of Newcastle on Sunday. Klopp believes the post-match interview illustrated the tension of the title race on Guardiola more than any statement of fact, and likened it to his criticism of Antonio Conte’s tactics after Tottenham’s 1-1 draw at Anfield on Saturday. But the Liverpool manager considers his team worthy of wider support for delivering a genuine title race and ensuring City do not win a fourth league championship in five seasons at a canter. “Imagine how the situation would be if we were not that close. Then the interviews would be boring,” Klopp said. “You have to make sure there is some excitement and there is an exciting battle for who stays in the league and an exciting battle for who qualifies for the Champions League. But imagine if we were not closer. “It [Guardiola’s reaction] is completely normal. We all feel the tension, we cannot say we don’t feel it. After the Tottenham game, it is not like I thought: ‘Great’, but before you can deal with your emotions you have already faced 20 cameras. That is what Pep did. I don’t take it as a backhanded compliment. He probably thought he has to make this point. You know much better than I do it is not the case.” Liverpool can go level on points with City on Tuesday with victory at Aston Villa, albeit having played one game more, but Klopp is adamant Guardiola is mistaken in his view that the country wants the title to return to Anfield. “I live in Liverpool so, yes, here a lot of people want us to win the league – that’s true,” Klopp said. “But even here it’s probably only 50% because the other people [Evertonians] were involved in another fight, at least until yesterday. “As managers, and I had this experience recently, we are obviously massively influenced by the game. I said – and would I say it again? No – but I said after the [Tottenham] game: ‘They play like they play and are still only fifth.’ It felt good in that moment but it was wrong. I could not respect Antonio more and what he is doing and how he organises teams. “I don’t know exactly which situation Pep was in, after getting knocked out of the Champions League that is obviously difficult enough to take, but then of course Liverpool made it to the final and you have these things like: ‘They only played Villarreal, we played Real,’ and then you say what you say. And he is right, on top of it. I was right about Tottenham. He was right we only won the Premier League once. I have no idea if the whole country is supporting us. That is not the feeling I get when we go to other places and play there, it is actually the opposite, but maybe he knows more about that than me.” Klopp insists Liverpool will not “stop believing” they can win the league until it is mathematically impossible. He also claimed the title challengers should take encouragement from their display against Spurs, despite dropping points for only the third time this year. “It was not a perfect game but the general approach, the counter press, was completely on a different level,” said the Liverpool manager, who could recall Roberto Firmino from injury at Villa Park. “We win it and we talk about that. ‘Wow, the counter press of Liverpool.’ We don’t win it and we just forget it. I don’t [forget it] because that keeps us going. “That is how I see it [nothing is broken]. That is how I saw the game. So we keep going. That is the nature of the thing and that is with the quality of the opponent and the goalkeeper and you know we had the situations [to win]. If Virg [van Dijk] gets the header here [forehead] instead of here [points to the side of his face], it is at least a better chance than hitting the bar. “We didn’t score from a set piece but we could have because everything was nearly perfect. We have to accept that. Now we have to use the good things, delete the bad things and go from here.”",Sport/Football,"Premier League needs Liverpool to challenge Manchester City, says Klopp",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/09/premier-league-needs-liverpool-to-challenge-manchester-city-says-klopp
