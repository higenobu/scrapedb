4/20/2022,"Netflix lost subscribers for the first time in 10 years at the start of the year and said it expects to lose even more in the spring, sending its share price crashing again on Tuesday. The streaming giant’s share price initially fell close to 20% on news that ​​it had lost 200,000 subscribers globally during the first quarter. Wall Street had been expecting the company to add 2.5 million subscribers. Netflix expects to lose 2 million global subscribers in the current quarter. The company blamed the drop on a number of factors, including its huge size, increased competition, the economy, the war in Ukraine, slowing rollout of broadband, and the large number of people who share their Netflix accounts with non-paying households. It also said the decision to close up shop in Russia cost the company 700,000 new additions. Netflix said in a note to investors: “Streaming is winning over linear, as we predicted, and Netflix titles are very popular globally. However, our relatively high household penetration – when including the large number of households sharing accounts – combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds.” The company recently announced a crackdown in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru on people sharing their Netflix accounts with other households. It is expected to expand the scheme. According to its latest financial report, on top of its 222 million paying households, Netflix is being shared with over 100 million additional households, an issue that makes it “harder to grow membership in many markets” and a problem that was obscured by the company’s growth during the pandemic. “Our plan is to reaccelerate our viewing and revenue growth by continuing to improve all aspects of Netflix – in particular, the quality of our programming and recommendations, which is what our members value most,” Netflix said. The decline brought Netflix’s paid global subscriber base to 221.6 million, down from 221.8 million in the prior quarter. The company made $1.6bn in profit over the quarter on $7.8m in sales. This is Netflix’s second consecutive set of disappointing results. In January, when the company announced subscriber growth was slowing, investors wiped almost $45bn (£33bn) from its value.",News/Media,Netflix loses subscribers for first time in 10 years – and expects to lose more,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/19/netflix-loses-subscribers-first-time-10-years-ukraine-shared-logins
4/20/2022,"Ursula Todd can’t stop dying. That’s the premise of this devastating drama, a four-part adaptation of Kate Atkinson’s 2013 novel, which documents its protagonist’s many demises – each as distressing as the last. Born to a wealthy middle-class family in 1910, Ursula dies almost instantly, strangled by her umbilical cord. But, then again, she survives – a fact relayed to us by Lesley Manville’s equanimous narrator. It’s a pattern that repeats throughout Ursula’s many comfortable childhoods: there’s a drowning incident, a fall out of a bedroom window, multiple battles with Spanish flu. And then, suddenly, she is back, being born, and doing it all over again – but this time with self-protective instincts she can’t quite account for. It’s The Butterfly Effect meets Groundhog Day (or rather “Groundhog Life”), only with none of the latter’s droll cosiness. There’s not a huge amount to laugh about in Life After Life (BBC Two). The show’s main priority is apparent from the start: making people cry. If you like the feeling of being overwhelmed by vicarious trauma and grief then you’re in for a treat. And the anguish is thoroughly addictive. It’s what makes Life After Life incredibly compelling, binge-worthy even, despite being practically plotless from one episode to the next. The tragedy of Ursula’s life is amorphous and inevitable and not particularly personal; it has no through-line besides the fact that the story is set during a uniquely dangerous time in British history. That’s no accident: it’s what makes her incessant dying entirely plausible. Although the first world war doesn’t directly affect her bucolic childhood, it still kills her (her father volunteers to fight, which then leads to the window fall). The 1918 influenza pandemic is harrowing – unbelievably so, from the Todds’ perspective, especially given the timing. “Hasn’t there been enough suffering?” is the dismissive response of Ursula’s steely, capable mother, unconvinced that there is a threat until it’s far too late. Yet it’s when the action moves into the second world war that the universe darkens more profoundly. Until this point, Ursula’s lives have got longer and generally better. Now that progress stalls: she cannot avoid news of her beloved little brother Teddy’s death, however many times her life reboots. Her wartime experiences vary wildly – from a glittering civil service career to family life in Germany that descends into hellish starvation – but they are all deeply disturbing, the latter almost nauseatingly so. In one sense, Life After Life has found a dramatic cheat code. Killing off a protagonist – especially such a sweet, thoughtful, young one – is a shortcut to brutal emotional impact. Surely a drama almost entirely made up of that moment, or the promise of it happening imminently, is an easy way to get viewers on tenterhooks? And yet it soon begins to feel miraculous that we are never inured to the awfulness of Ursula’s deaths. You can’t mourn her when you know you’ll be seeing her in the next scene, and yet you still do. That’s not so much because of a particular affection for Ursula (Thomasin McKenzie) herself. She’s not a hugely distinctive personality, something necessary to accommodate all the twists her life takes. It’s not even really because of the convincing nature of the show’s world, though it does a brilliant job of making period archetypes – the grumpy servant, imperious mother, gadabout maiden aunt – seem three-dimensional (thanks mainly to the stellar cast: Jessica Hynes, Fleabag’s Sian Clifford and Jessica Brown Findlay, respectively). What makes Life After Life so upsetting is that it feels real in a broader way. Whether these deaths have actually befallen the fictional Ursula is beside the point. Their historical grounding means we know they happened to somebody, somewhere, at some time. Keep watching Life After Life to make sense of its central mystery – or, indeed, its central protagonist – and you will be disappointed. Ursula never gets close to unravelling a purpose behind her predicament. “I don’t know why we live – all we do is die,” she mourns on a blitz deathbed of rubble and dust towards the end of the series, still completely mystified by the meaning of her multiple lives. Usually, such drama pulls strings in order to wrap things up with a cheap, life-affirming glow, but Ursula gets only glimmers of comfort from others. Her journalist aunt Izzie – a 1920s Carrie Bradshaw – advocates viewing life as an adventure. Her avuncular psychiatrist quotes Nietzsche on amor fati – embracing your own fate. Her father, meanwhile, offers more banal words about human kindness. Really, it is less about the content of their advice than the love implicit in it, which is a powerful consolation for death. That love radiates from Ursula after the conversation with her father as she boards the train back to wartime London with a heartbreaking spring in her step, ready to die all over again.",Arts/Television & radio,Life After Life review – a thoroughly addictive weepathon,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/19/life-after-life-review-a-thoroughly-addictive-weepathon
4/20/2022,"Stop me if you think you’ve heard this one before: the Coalition, abetted by News Corp, claims a Labor policy to accelerate the rollout of renewable energy and do more to tackle the climate crisis would trigger a damaging jump in electricity prices. The full horror was splashed across the tabloids on Tuesday. “Labor’s price surge,” shouted the Daily Telegraph. “Bill shock war,” said the Herald Sun. You get the idea. The story itself was a bit more nuanced, but emphasised the Coalition’s framing – that government modelling estimated an average annual power bill would leap by $560 over the next decade if the ALP was running the show. No mention was made of what would happen if the Morrison government was returned. This will all be familiar to anyone traumatised by scare campaigns run in Australia’s decade-plus climate wars. This is how lies and doubt get seeded – an easy-to-understand claim about cost based on “modelling”, an outraged page one headline, questions that “need to be answered”. Whatever follows, well argued or otherwise, struggles to compete for attention. Discussion about the cost of delaying action on climate change? Evidence that there are economic benefits in cutting greenhouse gas emissions even more rapidly? Much less likely to get a look in. But the details should matter, so let’s act like they do. A cursory glance reveals what Angus Taylor, the energy and emissions reduction minister, released on Tuesday did not prove what the story claimed. No modelling was immediately produced and Taylor did not publicly claim there was any. The word “modelling” does not appear in the two-page press release issued by his office. The release does not go into any significant detail about how the claimed $560 power price hike was calculated. Taylor’s statement claims there is a “hidden cost” to an ALP commitment to create a $20bn “rewiring the nation corporation” to accelerate new transmission links to allow a faster influx of large-scale solar, wind and batteries. The corporation is part of Labor’s “Powering Australia” climate policy, which the opposition claims would reduce average annual power bills by $378 and cut emissions by 43% compared with 2005 levels by 2030 – well beyond the Coalition target of 26-28%, but still less than what scientific advice says is necessary. In his press release and at the media conference that followed, Taylor claimed Labor wanted to increase the value of the electricity transmission network by $78bn by spending big on new connections that were not recommended by the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo), and would be bad for the economy and for consumers. Some experts wondered whether Taylor’s office may have reached the $560 hike just by taking this $78bn and spreading it across the country’s power bills. If this is right, it is a simplistic back-of-the-envelope calculation. The $78bn claim comes from a line in the ALP’s modelling, carried out by the consultants RepuTex, that says the party’s commitment to spend $20bn would “unlock $58bn of private co-financing”. The Labor policy does not say this would all be spent on poles and wires, or suggest what proportion would be expected to be passed on to consumers. It also does not say Labor would go against Aemo’s advice, but that it would offer support to projects beyond those earmarked as priorities. Some experts said if investment commitments were made in line with Aemo’s evolving integrated system plan – its blueprint for an optimal grid – an increasing number were likely to make economic sense. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a clear misrepresentation by the government on Tuesday, Scott Morrison and Taylor attempted to co-opt the views of several experts as supporting their position. All had raised doubts about Labor’s claims, but some made clear that they had been selectively quoted in Taylor’s press release. At a press conference in Western Australia, Morrison claimed Tony Wood, the energy policy director from the Grattan Institute, had said Labor’s policy was a “mess” that would end up in connections being “at the wrong place at the wrong time”. Wood later told Guardian Australia that was “not what I said”. “I did not describe Labor’s policy as a mess,” he said. “The regulatory process, the process of building transmission, is a mess. I said putting all this emphasis on lowering the cost of transmission is wrong, and that we need to get the regulation of transmission sorted out.” None of this is straightforward, and energy market experts say there are unanswered questions about the ALP’s policy. Some disagree that new transmission links will lead to prices coming down as much as RepuTex found, if at all. While public involvement in driving the investment needed could lower capital costs, and everyone acknowledges solar and wind are the cheapest forms of generation once built, the scale of the proposed spending is massive. But a key point overlooked in the government’s attack on Tuesday was that Labor is proposing little that would not also be on the table if the Coalition was returned to power. For all the rhetoric and hot air, the most significant difference between the two is that the incumbents say they will make the change at a slower pace and are taking further steps to put the brakes on. They have not explained how this will lead to Australia reaching net zero emissions by 2050, as promised. The key questions for all should be to explain how quickly and efficiently they will help drive what is an inevitable transformation, and what they will do to help harness the economic opportunities it can bring. The rest is just noise.",News/Australia news,The Coalition-News Corp attack on Labor’s energy policy is all too familiar | Adam Morton,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2022/apr/20/coalition-news-corp-attack-on-labor-energy-policy-is-all-too-familiar
4/20/2022,"Fulham are back where they belong, that being the netherworld between the Championship and Premier League where the club has spent the last five summers. Each summer since 2017 has seen the club either promoted to or demoted from the top division. With two goals from Aleksandar Mitrovic, taking him to 40 for the season, and another from Fabio Carvalho, two stars of the campaign made sure Fulham achieved their objective for the season. The planning starts now on how to avoid that state of summer limbo. Marco Silva is set to manage his fourth Premier League club in just over five years and has almost as much to prove as Fulham. Having not dropped below a top-two position since the 13th match of the campaign and scored 98 goals, 33 more than anyone else, his team are more than worthy of their elevation. But as Norwich and Watford have shown this season and as the Cottagers themselves well know, Championship domination represents zero guarantee of comfort come August. The incomplete but already towering Riverside Stand suggests modernisation as a possible answer to how Fulham might stop being a yo-yo club. But having spent close to £100m on players for the doomed 2018-19 campaign and reported losses of £93m for a similarly fated 2020-21 season, Shahid Khan, their American billionaire owner, will have to keep digging deep. A similar set of players came down under Scott Parker and Silva and Khan surely must augment them with greater quality, even if promotion has been achieved with flair and fun, enterprising football. After defeats to Coventry and Derby, merely edging over the line would have sufficed for Fulham. Nottingham Forest’s defeat of West Brom had added tension to what might instead have been a promotion party from the start. Preston, on a decent run and without relegation or promotion to concern them, might have been slippery. The visitors began with zest. It took a clawing save from Marek Rodak to deny Ched Evans after Cameron Archer and Daniel Johnson’s interchange had left the Fulham goalkeeper exposed. Rodak was soon asked to palm over Ben Whiteman’s dig from distance. Fulham began to make use of the space created by Preston’s ambition. Mitrovic had scored against every team in the Championship division this season other than Coventry and Preston. By the tenth minute, only Coventry remained. Joe Bryan surged in from the left, his angled pass finding the Serb in perfect position to stroke beyond Daniel Iversen. Embodying his club, Mitrovic is so potent in the Championship and yet has often been hugely disappointing in the higher echelon. A neat interchange between Mitrovic and the Liverpool-bound Fabio Carvalho might have resulted in a second in the 25th minute, only for the teenager to fire wide, not long before Evans limped off, the striker booed by home fans as he departed. Carvalho did not have to wait long, scoring from closer range with a flick of his left after Neeskens Kebano’s cross deflected into his path. And by the 42nd minute, the party could begin in earnest, Mitrovic firing under Iversen after Harry Wilson’s pass. Not that the party was too raucous, a third promotion in six seasons felt low on novelty when considering what followed the previous two. Admittedly, it is hard to raise the roof on an entirely empty stand, though the Hammersmith End sounded happy enough, singing “stand up if you’re Premier League”. The second half began almost like the first, Rodak making a fine save from Archer before Mitrovic was sent clear at the other end only for Iversen to win the one-on-one duel, deflecting the shot on to the crossbar. Preston’s Danish keeper then made a fine double stop from Carvalho and Mitrovic, heavily in the market for a hat-trick, as Fulham dominated possession and fans began to implore their heroes to shoot from all angles and distances. With 15 minutes left, Carvalho left the field to a standing ovation, having recovered from what looked a hefty knock from a challenge from Bambo Diaby. And soon after, so did Mitrovic, no treble to his name but his tally of goals a brilliant achievement nonetheless. Soon enough, the game having petered out, Fulham could celebrate being a Premier League club once again as fans emptied on to the pitch. Now to try and last longer than a season up there.",Sport/Football,Fulham seal Premier League return as Mitrovic starts party against Preston,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/19/fulham-preston-championship-match-report
