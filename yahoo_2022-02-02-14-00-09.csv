More: Wampum man accepts plea in child rape and infant death case, could face 18 to 36 years According to court records, Ellwood City police first became aware of the infant death on Nov. 13, 2017, when they were called to UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh for a 16-year-old borough girl who ended up on a ventilator because of health problems caused by not receiving proper treatment after giving birth. The girl admitted to having a child with Kennedy, a family friend, and said they had been ""in a relationship"" for about three years. She said Kennedy told her they could not have the child because he would get into trouble, so he gave her chemicals in August to attempt a miscarriage. But on Oct. 9, 2017, she gave birth to a boy in her upstairs bathroom. Police reported the girl initially said she was alone at the time of the birth and strangled the child to death. However, she later admitted Kennedy was there and killed the baby. She told police they hid the body in a box in her bedroom closet. When police searched the closet, officers said they noticed the smell immediately despite items such as spices and perfume placed there to alleviate the odor. Police said they removed boxes that were stacked on a blue container and opened it to find a large black plastic bag inside that contained a safe. The body and other items were entombed in cement inside the safe. Police said the safe had been bought by Kennedy and they were able to find the chemicals the girl said he had given her. Kennedy had been in SCI Rockview since Dec. 22 Nicholas Vercilla is a staff reporter for the Ellwood City Ledger. He can be reached at nvercilla@gannett.com.

2/2/2022,"The World Health Organization on Tuesday cautioned countries eager to lift coronavirus precautions, saying Omicron hasn’t yet peaked in many countries. WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DIRECTOR-GENERAL, TEDROS ADHANOM GHEBREYESUS: ""It's premature for any country either to surrender or to declare victory. This virus is dangerous, and it continues to evolve before our very eyes. WHO is currently tracking four sub-lineages of the Omicron variant, including BA.2."" The emerging BA.2 form of the Omicron coronavirus variant does not seem to be any more severe than the original BA.1 form, a World Health Organization official said on Tuesday. WHO TECHNICAL LEAD FOR COVID-19, MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: ""There's no indication that there's a change in severity. Again, omicron overall we know is more transmissible, it has more growth advantage and causes less severe disease than Delta. But it's still a very dangerous virus."" The comments come as the BA.2 version of Omicron begins to replace the more common ""original"" BA.1 version in countries such as Denmark. These two main lineages of Omicron differ from each other by more than 40 point mutations. BA.2 was first identified in South Africa in early December. BA.2 is more transmissible than the more common BA.1 and more able to infect vaccinated people, according to a Danish study that analyzed infections in more than 8,500 Danish households between December and January. VAN KERKHOVE: ""We need people to be aware that this virus is continuing to circulate, and it's continuing to evolve."" WHO officials said vaccines, masking and social distancing are still effective tools to fight the virus.",Health/Reuters Videos,Omicron BA.2 likely as severe as 'original' -WHO,https://news.yahoo.com/omicron-ba-2-likely-severe-194040807.html
