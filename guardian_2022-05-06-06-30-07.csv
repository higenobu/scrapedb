5/6/2022,"If you didn’t know it was true, you wouldn’t believe it. That’s the abiding sense left by the latest miniseries from HBO Max (shown here on Sky Atlantic), The Staircase. The eight-part drama tells the story of Michael Peterson, whose second wife, Kathleen, died in December 2001. He claimed he found her at the foot of the stairs she had fallen down while drunk and cradled her as he called the emergency services and she breathed her last. The police in Durham, North Carolina, confronted with a body whose head “looked like it exploded” and which seemed to have breathed its last quite some time before the call, reckoned he bludgeoned her to death. Peterson was arrested for first degree murder. The subsequent investigation revealed a millefeuille of layers to the man, the family and the story. If this all sounds familiar, it may be because it has already been the subject of another eight-part miniseries: the 2004 Peabody award-winning documentary of the same name by Jean-Xavier de Lestrade. I’m not sure how much anybody who has seen that meticulous piece of work, let alone the five follow-up episodes that appeared in 2013 and 2018, needs what is effectively a dramatisation of all the ground covered there. But for those who haven’t, the latter is undoubtedly a hugely compelling who/if/how/whydunnit. For those who have, think of it as a more sophisticated, prestige version of 1984’s Fatal Vision instead of a gutted Gallic thinkpiece and see how you get on. It opens, briefly, in 2017 with Peterson (Colin Firth) getting smartly dressed and psyching himself up for what appears to be another ordinary day at work. We are then hurled back to the fateful night in December, 16 years ago, as he makes a hysterical 911 call begging for an ambulance. Then we move back again to a few months before, when Michael, Kathleen (Toni Collette) and their children/wards (one from Kathleen’s previous relationship, four from Michael’s) have gathered for a family dinner and college send-off for one of them. There is some bickering among the kids, but basically all is well. The American dream lives. The drama moves in and out of various timelines – 2017, the months (then weeks, then days, kept careful count of in the corner of the screen) leading up to Kathleen’s death, and the preparation for Peterson’s trial. It skates close to becoming disorientating – particularly when Lestrade (Vincent Vermignon) and his documentary team turn up to make their film – but the timeline-hopping generally adds to the growing tension. And what tension there is. At first the family is united by the horror. But under pressure, cracks form. As evidence against Michael grows – if not probative of murder, then at least of the fact that he is not quite the man they thought he was – the family begins to fracture. Kathleen’s sisters turn against him (Rosemarie DeWitt as one, Candace, is a pure, cold Fury); the children either change allegiance or cling with increasingly blind and furious faith to their belief in the only parent they have left; and their uncle Bill (Tim Guinee) is tested to the very limit as revelations accrue and he is blindsided at every turn. Like Alice, he and the viewer sometimes feel they are being asked to absorb six impossible things before breakfast. It’s here that the core credibility of documentary form is needed – the urge to dismiss some of the twists taken by the case, when you know you’re watching actors acting, is almost overwhelming. The American legal system comes under dramatic scrutiny, too. We see the lawyers, Jim Hardin (Cullen Moss) and Freda Black (a magnificently flinty Parker Posey), amassing facts but deciding on the best prosecutorial “tricks” with which to present them, and others along the way nudging would-be errant players into position. Like the documentary, it is as much a portrait of how we construct a truth and the impossibility, once humans in all their messy complexity get involved, of ever uncovering a single, shining, objective one. Firth and Collette are, as you might expect, brilliant. The former is slippery and arrogant, putting in a performance that teeters on so many brinks – deeply loving yet coercive with family, paralysed with grief yet sociopathically detached, self-indulgent yet narcissistic – that you cannot help watching to see if and which way he will fall. Collette is given less to work with, but nevertheless conjures it into an impressive turn as a loving wife periodically placed in impossible situations. We see her navigating rough domestic waters and divided loyalties in a weary, occasionally desperate way many will recognise. All in all, a staircase well worth climbing.",Arts/Television & radio,The Staircase review – Colin Firth and Toni Collette scale the heights in riveting true-crime tale,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/05/the-staircase-review-colin-firth-and-toni-collette
5/6/2022,"Leicester’s European adventure came to an end in Rome as Tammy Abraham’s 27th goal of the season, an early header, decided this Europa Conference League semi-final. Brendan Rodgers said he hoped his side would be able to keep their story going but exited the competition after failing to hurt Roma at a typically noisy Stadio Olimpico. José Mourinho could yet cap his first season in charge of the Serie A club with a trophy in Tirana later this month. Rodgers knew his players would be given a warm Roman welcome and they were greeted by an intimidating atmosphere. They arrived on to the pitch about an hour before kick-off to loud jeers – even when the 3,500 travelling supporters cheered the name of their title-winning manager, Claudio Ranieri, who managed both of these clubs with mixed success, they were drowned out by a partisan home crowd – but the goalkeepers seemed determined to keep things relaxed, starting their warmup with a crossbar challenge from halfway. Outside, Roma fans geared up for the game on Ponte Duca d’Aosta, the bridge on the Tiber river a scene a carmine red haze. The Leicester chairman, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, who mingled with supporters in Eindhoven in the previous round, made a point of going over to the away fans before shaking the hand of every one of his players as they emerged for the warmup. Shortly before kick-off the Curva Sud unfurled a giant tifo depicting the words In Britannia Cuncti Nomen Romanorum Horrebant, ‘Everyone in Britain dreads the name of the Romans.’ Rodgers had explicitly pointed to Roma’s key threats being on the counterattack and set plays so the sight of Abraham towering above Ricardo Pereira to power in a header from an out-swinging corner after 11 minutes would have been galling. Rodgers quietly retreated to the away dugout. Mourinho was unmoved, as if this was par for the course. Feyenoord will meet Roma in the Europa Conference League final on an ill-tempered night in Marseille. The second leg of the semi-final between was marred by fan violence in the buildup as supporters from both sides clashed with each other and police, while a brick was thrown at the visitors' team bus.  The first leg had been a five-goal thriller, but this was more of a cagey affair with the best chance of the first half falling to Marseille's Dimitri Payet, who sliced a shot wide when he should have scored.Marseille pressed for the goal they needed to equalise on aggregate, but Feyenoord held on for a 0-0 draw to win 3-2 on aggregate and reach their first European final since they last lifted the Uefa Cup in 2002. Reuters By then Roma had already panicked Kasper Schmeichel, Lorenzo Pellegrini’s whipped free-kick towards the front post forcing the Leicester goalkeeper into an unconvincing save, after Pereira upended Nicola Zalewski, the exuberant Roma wing-back who also impressed in the first leg. Rodgers lined his team up to attack Roma – James Justin and Harvey Barnes replaced Timothy Castagne and Marc Albrighton with the manager recognising the need for pace at both ends and positioned his front three on halfway at corners – but they failed to test Rui Patrício during a frustrating first half. Six minutes after falling behind, Schmeichel was alert to make a save from a tight angle after Pellegrini latched on to a cute through ball and Roma headed down the tunnel at the break unruffled. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, a year on from playing for Luton at home to Rotherham in the Championship, tried his luck with a curled effort that was always sailing wide and soon after the big screens at each end of this enormous arena displayed the face of a rather content Francesco Totti. It was that kind of night. Rodgers switched to a back three at half-time, introducing Daniel Amartey and Kelechi Iheanacho in place of Barnes and Ademola Lookman, who had been easily shackled, and pushed Pereira and Justin forward to wing-back. Leicester restarted with a discernible vim, Dewsbury-Hall digging his heels in to win a free-kick and moments later Justin surged forward down the left flank before his attempt to pick out Jamie Vardy was cut out for a corner. Dewsbury-Hall sent another shot flashing wide shortly after the television cameras panned to Ranieri. The Italian stood to acknowledge the applause emanating from both the home and away sections. Leicester had roused and Vardy saw a shot blocked after he met James Maddison’s low corner. Leicester saw more of the ball in the second half but their first shot on target did not arrive until the 79th minute when Maddison shot straight at Patrício and Iheanacho located the same target a few minutes later. Zalewski saw a shot blocked by the substitute Castagne and Abraham geed up the home fans to ensure Mourinho’s team got over the line.",Sport/Football,Tammy Abraham heads Roma into final to end Leicester’s European hopes,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/05/roma-leicester-europa-conference-league-match-report
5/6/2022,"The 60th game of Rangers’ season delivered the most memorable moment of all. There could be better – far better – to come in Seville on 18 May. With Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s team on the ropes and RB Leipzig in the ascendancy, John Lundstram bulged the net in front of the Copland Road stand. The level of euphoria depicted a goal for the ages. Who cared that it was scrappy? Rangers, a decade on from financial meltdown, will compete in a Europa League final. Leipzig will be sore about that given their prominence at the time of Lundstram’s intervention but the truth is Rangers’ effective football prevailed. Rangers could take heart despite last week’s 1-0 loss in Saxony. Leipzig had been frustrated and blunt for long spells of that first leg tie, with Sunday’s Bundesliga defeat to Börussia Monchengladbach adding to a sense Rangers may be meeting Domenico Tedesco’s team at the right time. The counterpoint related to Leipzig’s useful propensity to score away goals in Europe; the claiming of the opening goal here would leave Rangers, who started without a recognised striker in their line-up, facing a stern challenge. The subdued, slightly curious pre-match scene owed everything to the sudden death of Rangers’ kit man of more than three decades, Jimmy Bell. Yet after the completion of a minute’s silence, everything suddenly felt normal again. Just as Bell would want it to be. Leipzig used the earliest exchanges to suggest the carrying of a threat on the break, without posing any challenge to Allan McGregor in the Rangers goal. The hosts provided ruthlessness where the Germans could not, sending Ibrox into raptures when doing so. Glen Kamara started the attack that restored aggregate parity, with the midfielder freeing Ryan Kent on the left flank. Kent drove into the penalty area before firing across the face of goal. As is typical, the captain James Tavernier popped up from right back to slam beyond Peter Gulácsi from close range. Leipzig frustration would have been intensified by the fact their countrymen from Borussia Dortmund had lost an almost identical goal at Ibrox earlier in this competition. Not content at hauling themselves back into the tie, Rangers snatched the lead just six minutes later. This was a goal of wonderful quality, Joe Aribo’s pass to Scott Wright the precursor to a curling finish by Kamara from 19 yards. Wright had cushioned the ball beautifully into Kamara’s path. Only a glaring miss from Aribo prevented Rangers from notching three goals within the first half hour. Leipzig, so strangely for a team which plays at such a high domestic level, were dazed and confused. Dani Olmo missed the target with their first opportunity of note. Willi Orban headed wide from Angeliño’s free-kick. These flirtations with the Rangers goal aside, Leipzig offered nothing. Tedesco was surely happy to retire to the dressing room with no further damage done. His star forward, Christopher Nkunku, spent the first half on the game’s periphery. Aribo had been removed from proceedings seconds before the break after suffering a head injury. His replacement, Fashion Sakala, connected with a Kent cross within five minutes of the restart but watched his header drift beyond Gulácsi’s left-hand post. The good news for Rangers was that Leipzig had still failed to test McGregor with an hour played. Tedesco grew increasingly and visibly agitated. No wonder; having slipped to fifth in the Bundesliga, this Europa League campaign suddenly provided a route into next season’s Champions League as may be necessary. Red Bull did not plough millions into this club, which had not even been formed when Rangers reached the Uefa Cup final of 2008, for the provision of false dawns. Could Nkunku, who arrived in Glasgow having found the net more than 30 times this season, really draw blanks in back-to-back games against Rangers? It transpired he could not. From Angeliño’s whipped ball from the left, the Frenchman connected with a first time volley as left McGregor helpless. Nkunku, the star man, had lived up to his growing reputation at the precise moment his employers needed him to. Moments earlier, McGregor had saved brilliantly from the marauding Konrad Laimer. Leipzig had a pulse, as apparently due primarily to Tedesco replacing the hopelessly ineffectual Olmo with Dominik Szoboszlai. Leipzig now looked by far the more likely side. Yet this Rangers run has been built on occasionally astonishing levels of resilience. Gulacsi flapped horribly at a cross ball, a moment his defensive colleagues were unable to atone for. Lundstram struck the decisive blow.",Sport/Football,Rangers’ Lundstram strikes late to beat RB Leipzig to Europa League final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/05/rangers-rb-leipzig-europa-league-match-report
5/6/2022,"The disappointment was too much for West Ham to bear in the end. Even David Moyes had lost control of his emotions by the time a demoralising night deep in the German forest was at an end. Any thoughts of Moyes’s team mounting a heroic comeback had long since passed and, for all that it was impossible to fault West Ham’s effort, nothing summed up their lack of composure more than the sight of their manager being sent off for kicking the ball at a ballboy during the dying stages. The pain was too raw. It was beautiful while it lasted but there will be no glorious ending in Seville later this month. For Moyes, who has never won a trophy as a manager, this stung. He knew that West Ham had blown their chance of reaching the Europa League final. They were not good enough in the first leg and their hopes of turning it around here were over after Aaron Cresswell’s foolhardy red card handed the initiative to Eintracht Frankfurt, who sealed a 3-1 win aggregate win thanks to Rafael Santos Borré’s goal. Moyes had spoken about the need for West Ham to manage the game. There were also attempts at mind games from the Scot when he suggested that Frankfurt could struggle to protect their lead from the first leg. Yet this wonderfully atmospheric stadium was bouncing long before kick-off and given the noise generated by the home fans it was even possible to wonder if it was part of the show when a small fire broke out at the end housing Frankfurt’s ultras, until a few stewards rushed across to deal with the blaze seven minutes into the game. It felt like it was going to be that kind of evening. By that stage Frankfurt had already lost their influential centre-back Martin Hinteregger after he injured a knee due to a challenge from Michail Antonio. It seemed like a big blow for the hosts who rejigged their back three by bringing on Almamy Touré, and at that point the signs were good for West Ham, who enjoyed plenty of possession during the early stages and looked capable of creating chances. Yet disaster was lurking. It was galling for Moyes to see one of his most experienced players gift Frankfurt the initiative with a 17th-minute challenge. West Ham could not afford any false moves and Cresswell had nobody but himself to blame when he failed to deal with a hopeful punt, the slightest hint of hesitation from the left-back enough to give Jens Petter Hauge a chance to steal possession and burst through on goal. Cresswell was too slow to respond. Hauge was far more assertive. The Norwegian had made his mark and the only surprise was that Jesús Gil Manzano, the Spanish referee, initially reached for a yellow card when Cresswell dragged the Frankfurt forward down just outside the area. Everybody could see it was a denial of a goalscoring opportunity from Cresswell, who had learned nothing from being sent off for the same offence against Lyon in the previous round. Frankfurt appealed for a red and the outcome was inevitable when Manzano was told to check the pitchside monitor: Cresswell was left to make a long, lonely trudge down the tunnel and although West Ham survived Filip Kostic slamming the resulting free-kick wide, it already seemed inconceivable that Frankfurt would not progress. The numerical advantage soon told. West Ham adjusted after going down to 10 men, shoring up their defence by replacing Manuel Lanzini with Ben Johnson, but it was not enough. Frankfurt, who had only won once at home since Christmas, simply had too much space. They kept the ball moving and were ahead after carving West Ham apart in the 26th minute, Ansgar Knauff surging past Johnson on the right and pulling the ball back for Borré to beat Alphonse Areola with a low finish. At least West Ham continued to fight. Antonio threatened, almost running through before Evan Ndicka stepped in with a fine challenge. Hope flared. Another run from Antonio ended with Ndicka picking up a booking for a crude lunge on the striker and the equaliser almost arrived when a free-kick from Jarrod Bowen reached Kurt Zouma, who was unable to turn the ball over the line. Yet West Ham did not have enough options in attack without Lanzini on the pitch. Pablo Fornals was rarely involved and Bowen saw little of the ball. Frankfurt were comfortable. Their intensity made life awkward for West Ham and it summed up the pattern of play when Declan Rice tried to surge through midfield early in the second half, only to take a heavy touch and lose the ball as he tried to release it to Bowen. It was not to be and the challenge now for West Ham is to ensure this is not the end. This is a good team that just needs a sprinkling of quality added to it. Summer will be pivotal. It is a chance to push on, to keep building around Rice, to ensure these occasions are not a one-off. For now, though, all there will be is pain.",Sport/Football,West Ham’s Cresswell and Moyes see red as Frankfurt make Europa League final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/05/eintracht-frankfurt-west-ham-europa-league-match-report
5/6/2022,"Joe Biden has named his new press secretary, after it was announced that Jen Psaki will leave the administration, expected to become a TV host at MSNBC. Karine Jean-Pierre, currently the principal deputy press secretary, will be taking over the role after Psaki leaves in mid-May. Jean-Pierre, a political analyst, was Kamala Harris’s chief of staff during the vice-president’s presidential campaign in 2020 and served on Barack Obama’s campaigns in 2008 and 2012. She was also an adviser and spokesperson for MoveOn.org, a progressive Pac. Jean-Pierre will be the first Black person and first out gay person in the role. She has filled in for Psaki on several occasions, most recently while her predecessor was quarantining with Covid-19. “She is passionate. She is smart and she has a moral core that makes her not just a great colleague, but an amazing mom and human,” Psaki said on Twitter. “Plus, she has a great sense of humor.” In his statement, Biden also lauded Jean-Pierre’s “experience, talent and integrity”. “Jill and I have known and respected Karine a long time and she will be a strong voice speaking for me and this administration,” he said. Biden also lauded Psaki for her work in the role, which spanned tumultuous moments for the administration, including the Afghanistan evacuation, Omicron wave and, most recently, the leaked supreme court draft signaling the end of Roe v Wade. “Jen Psaki has set the standard for returning decency, respect and decorum to the White House briefing room.” Psaki’s last day will be 13 May.

5/6/2022,"Good morning. Australians have singled out the soaring cost of living as the most important issue for whichever party forms the next government. Fixing the aged care system is another top priority. And Israel’s high court has ruled to evict Palestinians in one of the single biggest expulsions in recent history. Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese are preparing for the final sprint to the 21 May election finish line. Labor can sniff victory but the Liberals are not giving up, hoping the final fortnight may yet see undecided voters stick with the devil they know. While national polls show Labor clearly ahead of the Coalition and in line for a comfortable victory, both sides suggest the contest could be close, with the low primary vote of each of the major parties making the result difficult to pick. Reducing the cost of living and fixing the aged care system are voters’ two top priorities, according to a Australian National University poll. The survey of more than 3,500 people found those two issues transcended the political divide, with more than 60% nominating them as top priorities, ranking ahead of issues of more concern to Coalition voters, including defence against terrorist attacks and reducing crime. A majority of voters also nominated strengthening the nation’s economy (54.4%), reducing the cost of healthcare (53.5%) and dealing with global climate change (52.8%) as top priorities for the federal government. The Morrison government’s climate change commitments are consistent with more than 3C of global heating, bordering on 4C, a level that would lead to catastrophic damage across the planet, according to a new analysis. Labor’s climate target was found to be consistent with about 2C of heating above pre-industrial levels. Both would be expected to lead to the loss of tropical coral reefs, including the Great Barrier Reef, and a significant rise in the number of extreme heat events in Australia, assuming other countries took equivalent action. The research by Climate Analytics found neither major party had emissions reduction goals that lived up to the commitment that was strengthened in last year’s Glasgow climate pact, to aim to limit heating to as close as possible to 1.5C. It found targets proposed by the Greens and the “teal independents” vying for inner-city seats were consistent with that mark. In Queensland, the Labor government is playing “a dangerous game” with coal that could hurt the party’s chances in inner-city Brisbane in the federal election, according a political expert. On Wednesday the state energy minister, Mick de Brenni, ruled out closing any of Queensland’s eight coal-fired power plants. Russia has unleashed heavy artillery barrages against multiple Ukrainian positions in the south and east of the country, amid conflicting claims over whether Russian forces were attempting to storm the last Ukrainian positions in the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. The EU plans to impose sanctions on Alina Kabaeva, long rumoured to be Vladimir Putin’s girlfriend and – according to a draft document seen by the Guardian – the head of the Russian Orthodox church, Patriarch Kirill, a long-serving Kremlin ally who has given his blessing to the war. US officials have also reportedly confirmed they are providing intelligence that has helped Ukrainian forces target and kill Russian generals.

Men are more likely to take time from their female partners for exercise, which women are not afforded equally in return, research suggests. Canberra researchers have analysed gender disparities in physical activity, finding that “hour for hour, paid or unpaid, women’s physical activity is constrained by their time use in ways that men’s is not”. A lively campaign is shaping up in the NSW mid-north coast electorate of Cowper, with a revealing candidates’ forum in Bellingen, preferencing games under way, a popular “Voices for” independent candidate, and an explanation of those United Australia party’s interest rate billboards. Despite predictions of stagflation, rural industries don’t need to panic – yet. There are three things agricultural businesses need to watch carefully in 2022: interest rates, the US economy and China’s lockdowns. After a two-decade legal battle, Israel’s high court has ruled that about 1,000 Palestinians can be evicted from an area of the West Bank and the land repurposed for Israeli military use, in one of the single biggest expulsion decisions since the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories began in 1967. Researchers say they have found traces of Xinjiang cotton in shirts and T-shirts made by Adidas, Puma and Hugo Boss, appearing to contradict the German clothing companies’ promises to revise their supply chains after allegations of widespread forced labour in the Chinese region. Reproductive rights activists across Latin America have vowed to protect hard-fought gains in their own territories as they brace for potential ripple effects if the US supreme court overturns Roe v Wade – the 1973 ruling that guarantees the right to abortion. Latin America has some of the most draconian anti-abortion laws in the world. But feminist movements have fought for decades to chip away at the prohibitions, and a younger, diverse generation of activists has mobilised to help clinch a string of victories in traditionally conservative countries. Featuring a migrant family in western Sydney, George Haddad’s novel Losing Face deals with masculinity and rape culture – without the luxury of easy answers. “The author’s depiction of rape culture is deftly handled: realistic and confronting, and not simply used as fodder for Joey’s growth as a character,” writes Sarah Ayoub. It’s not unusual for an journalist to write a memoir – but it is unusual for the memoir to not focus on journalism at all. Instead, Speaking in Tongues by former Triple J Hack host Tom Tilley is a family memoir of sorts, telling of Tilley’s time raised in the Revival Centres – a small Pentecostal church that requires its members to speak in tongues. It’s “a personal prayer”, Tilley says. “Using audible, indecipherable language to God.” “I’ve got a seven-month-old baby,” says a Guardian reader. “How do I make sure she doesn’t feel the same body shame I did?” Bracing a child for a bad outcome can teach them to expect it, writes advice columnist Eleanor Gordon-Smith.

5/6/2022,"A police officer is being investigated for potential driving offences following the death of a man who was hit by a police car. The incident occurred in Peacehaven, East Sussex, just after 11.10pm on Saturday. Arthur Holscher-Ermert, 27, was on foot near the junction of Dorothy Avenue when he was hit by an unmarked police car. He was pronounced dead at the scene a short time later. The Independent Office for Police Conduct has said that it has advised the driver of the car that he is now under criminal investigation for causing death by dangerous driving. The officer, a police constable, will also be investigated for potential gross misconduct. In a statement, the watchdog said that the opening of a criminal investigation does not necessarily mean charges will follow. “At the end of the investigation we will decide whether to refer a file to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider whether the officer should be prosecuted,” it said. The IOPC said it had so far gathered evidence indicating that Holscher-Ermert had been driving an Audi which was being pursued by a police car after it came to the attention of officers in the Newhaven and Peacehaven area. They said the pursuit ended in Bramber Avenue, where Holscher-Ermert left the Audi and was struck moments later by a different police vehicle. IOPC regional director Graham Beesley said they would examine the events leading up to the collision and police actions in the immediate aftermath, including reports that handcuffs were used on Holscher-Ermert at the scene. He said: “It is important we establish why Mr Holscher-Ermert was being pursued by the police, including what, if any, information the police had about him or the vehicle he was driving. “We will also consider whether the actions of officers afterwards were in line with policy and procedure. This will include looking at the aftercare given to him. “We are aware of reports handcuffs were applied to Mr Holscher-Ermert at the scene, and this will form part of our investigation.” He said Holscher-Ermert’s family had been informed and would be meeting with the IOPC soon. He added: “We understand the concern this incident has caused in the community and I would like to reassure everyone that we will carry out a thorough and independent investigation to establish exactly what happened and why.” The watchdog has reviewed dashcam footage from a member of the public who was driving in the area when the incident happened and are also analysing footage from the police car involved in the collision, as well as body-worn video from officers who arrived at the scene. Investigators have also been trying to locate any other CCTV footage that might be available, and to carry out house-to-house inquiries to identify any witnesses.The IOPC has appealed for anyone with information that might help to come forward.",News/UK news,Officer under investigation after man is fatally struck by police car,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/05/officer-under-investigation-after-man-is-fatally-struck-by-police-car
