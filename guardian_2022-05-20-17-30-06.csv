5/20/2022,"This season’s final-day title battle will have an air of familiarity as Manchester City look to pip Liverpool to the post for the third time in the last decade. Steven Gerrard will be in the opposition dugout at the stadium where the greatest finale of all played out 10 years ago. Folklore is in the air, but Pep Guardiola might feel frustrated that it has come to this. City could have few complaints with their draw at West Ham, digging in to rescue a vital point after a disastrous first half – but had Riyad Mahrez scored his late penalty, Liverpool would have been left needing snookers. Lukasz Fabianski’s fine save should not be overlooked, but the outcome highlights a curious weakness in Guardiola’s attacking machine. In the six seasons since he took charge, City have scored 34 of 50 spot-kicks awarded – the worst conversion rate among the ‘big six’ clubs. Even Sergio Agüero was guilty of the odd aberration but since his departure, Guardiola has struggled to settle on a penalty taker. Erling Haaland will bring a 92% success rate with him next season, but for now, City fans will hope another late spot-kick is not required. NMc Manchester City v Aston Villa, Sunday 4pm While much of the attention will be focused on a certain match 36 miles down the M62, it is imperative that Liverpool’s players beat Wolves so they can capitalise on any slip-ups by Manchester City against Aston Villa and win the title courtesy of what would be a seismic final-day overhaul. It was courtesy of a late mugging that Liverpool won the points in the corresponding fixture at Molineux in December, with Divock Origi winning it four minutes into added time, sparking wild celebrations among his teammates. Wolves may have nothing but wounded pride to play for on Sunday, but revenge will be on their minds and is a dish famously best served cold. A similarly spirited rearguard action from Bruno Lage’s men on Merseyside could cause plenty of problems. BG Liverpool v Wolves, Sunday 4pm Leeds almost certainly need to beat Brentford in west London while hoping Newcastle can do them a favour by taking points off Burnley. In December the two sides fought out a four-goal thriller at Elland Road, with Patrick Bamford snatching a late equaliser for Leeds. With five of the Leeds starting eleven that started that game out on Sunday through injury or suspension the odds seem stacked against Jesse Marsch’s side, while Bamford is reported to be “touch and go” having not played since mid-March. Playing the striker in such a massive game would constitute a massive gamble for the American but with so much at stake it may be one he is prepared to take. BG Brentford v Leeds United, Sunday 4pm Perhaps only a salmonella-infused lasagna can stop Tottenham taking their place in next season’s Champions League. Memories of final-day collapses that ended up favouring Arsenal may still be foremost in Spurs’ fans minds. That infamous May 2006 afternoon when illness wracked the squad and thus allowed Arsenal to creep into fourth place comes to mind. So does the final day of the 2015-16 season, when Spurs, Leicester’s closest challengers in the run-in, lost 5-1 at Newcastle to let Arsenal into second place. That day, like Sunday, Tottenham were facing an already-relegated club so the portents for another disaster are there. Spurs were a little shaky against Burnley last Sunday, though their turnaround time after beating Arsenal had admittedly been short. Norwich, with one win since January and relegated for weeks now, will surely not offer up anything like the same resistance, or play like Rafa Benítez’s Newcastle did six years ago. JB Norwich City v Tottenham, Sunday 4pm Newcastle players currently have the air about them of a team that just love playing football together, particularly in the newly vibrant cauldron that is St James’ Park. Ahead of a summer rich with promise, their final game of the season is against a Burnley side that continues to stare into the abyss. Given their vastly superior goal difference, Burnley only have to match whatever result Leeds get at Brentford to stay up. A win will guarantee them survival. Eddie Howe’s side began their revival with a narrow win over what was then Sean Dyche’s team at St James’ Park.It prompted raucous celebrations and they have since strengthened their squad considerably. Should Newcastle’s players assemble for another post-match victory snap at around 6pm on Sunday, the scenes in Burnley’s dressing-room could be of utter desolation. BG Burnley v Newcastle, Sunday 4pm And so Manchester United’s worst-ever Premier League season reaches its end. Even if it seemed like their players downed tools some weeks ago, Ralf Rangnick unable to effect change, there is still something to play for. Should United lose at Selhurst Park and West Ham win at Brighton then the Uefa Conference League, rather than the Europa League, will beckon. Even a draw might not be enough, as United have an inferior goal difference to the Hammers. Should Palace win by a margin of more than two goals, then United would end the season on a negative goal difference for the first time since the 1989-90 season, when they at least could say they concentrated on winning the FA Cup. Erik ten Hag will be in attendance, having pulled out of Ajax’s Caribbean post-season trip to Curaçao to try and get a head start on trying to regenerate a bedevilled institution. JB Crystal Palace v Manchester United, Sunday 4pm While Arsenal appeared to blow any hopes reeling in Spurs in the race for fourth place with back-to-back losses, they go into the final day clinging to the hope that Tottenham’s innate “Spursiness” will somehow prevail at Norwich, costing Antonio Conte’s side the point they need. In such a scenario, it should be remembered that Arsenal’s inherent “Arsenalness” could also stop them taking advantage by failing to beat an Everton side that secured safety on Thursday. It is a preposterously unlikely turn of events but one that shouldn’t be ruled out given the propensity of both to blunderbuss themselves repeatedly in the feet. Mikel Arteta’s side found themselves the subjects of much mockery and mirth following three consecutive defeats at the beginning of this season before hitting their stride. Should they conclude the campaign with three more, an accompanying Spurs defeat at Carrow Road would render them an international laughing stock. BG Arsenal v Everton, Sunday 4pm Stamford Bridge signs off for the summer amid deep uncertainty. Even if Todd Boehly’s takeover has been franked officially by then, supporters will still be none the wiser over what the future may bring. The most that is known is that the American would preside over a very different regime than Roman Abramovich, the Russian lionised among a vocal rump of supporters. Andreas Christensen’s ostracising by Thomas Tuchel after making himself unavailable for last weekend’s FA Cup final did not suggest a happy camp behind the scenes. Antonio Rüdiger will wave his goodbyes and fans and media alike will look for signs in the post-match lap of appreciation for whether other players expect to be around next season. Those under scrutiny will include César Azpilicueta, despite an extension being triggered, and Romelu Lukaku, whose Wembley display suggested he might have been the greatest transfer bust of the entire Abramovich era. JB Chelsea v Watford, Sunday 4pm There are bigger prizes up for grabs elsewhere, but a home win could lift Brighton up to eighth – and Graham Potter’s side are surely on course to seal their best-ever top-flight position. Last season, Potter’s “Expected Gulls” set a new benchmark for missed chances – finishing 16th despite a top-six expected points total. This season, they are just three points off that metric mark and beginning to turn expectation into reality. Sunday’s opponents offer Brighton the perfect example of how to not only match expectations but surpass them. West Ham will be back in Europe next season, with only their entry tier to be decided on Sunday. Finishing above Manchester United might also strengthen their position as they bid to convince their midfield linchpin, Declan Rice, that nowhere else can offer him a brighter long-term future. NMc Brighton v West Ham, Sunday 4pm Southampton end their season at the King Power with nothing significant to play for – that may come as a relief after a run of one win in 11 league games left them stumbling to the 40-point mark. During their post-Christmas surge, Ralph Hasenhüttl’s side threatened to challenge for Europe, but after that peak came a familiar trough. Leicester have also been dogged by inconsistency – avoid defeat here, and they will match their record unbeaten run this season at four games. Whatever the outcome, there’s a good chance the standout player will be an English midfielder called James; both Maddison and Ward-Prowse have impressed in mediocre campaigns for their season. Leicester’s player of the season must surely be back on Gareth Southgate’s radar, but his Southampton counterpart is one of the players standing in his way.

5/20/2022,"The mystery of what the heart wants, and what it might get in return, is the theme of this humane, sympathetic movie from Mia Hansen-Løve. For all its tendency to soap opera, it has a lovely happy-sad sweetness. The setting is the briskly and urbanely photographed Paris that Hansen-Løve showed us in her second film, Father of My Children from 2009. Just as in that movie, she shows us familiar tourist landmarks without them seeming cliched. And of course, fathers again loom very large. Léa Seydoux plays Sandra, a single mum, apparently widowed for many years, who speaks fluent English and German and works as an interpreter. We see her doing live audio-headphone translation at an international media conference, and also translating a powerful speech from a US army veteran at an Omaha beach reunion. The effect is to show us a clever, self-effacing professional who has been pushed to the margin of things, a little. She wears workaday jeans and sweaters and has a short haircut which looks businesslike rather than chic or gamine. Sandra has shut down emotionally because of her loss and devotion to her ailing elderly father, a former philosophy professor called Georg, beautifully played by character-acting veteran Pascal Greggory, who has the cruel neurodegenerative disorder Benson’s syndrome which causes a loss of vision and mental faculties in ways which resemble dementia. Now Sandra and her mother – that is, her dad’s ex-wife (Nicole Garcia) – have to get the poor, heartbreakingly sweet-natured and confused old guy into a care home. A tour of these institutions is embarked on and Seydoux shows us the classic, stunned response on seeing a place like this. Is it horrible? Should she try for somewhere better? Or is she simply not understanding that there may be nowhere better, nowhere that approximates his life before he needed a care home, and that these feelings she is having are just dismay and grief at what is happening. In parallel with all this, she experiences a kind of miracle, albeit of a fraught and complicated sort. Sandra runs into an old friend walking with his young son in the park; he is played by Melvil Poupaud and there is an instant spark. Soon they are having an adulterous affair made sexier by the gloomy sense that it is wrong and can’t last. Sandra is thus torn between two emotionally unavailable men: her beloved father and this new surreptitious boyfriend, to whom Hansen-Løve has given the rather too-good-to-be-true interesting job of cosmochemist, studying meteorites and the like. Her father hurts her feelings (inevitably) by appearing to forget who she is and where they are when she comes to see him, and seems more pleased to see his partner – the woman he took up with after Sandra’s mother but who has not done much to help in this current situation. Sandra confesses that she feels closer to her dad through his books than the man himself. But just as her father is out of reach, so is her new lover, who still has a connection to his wife, the mother of his son. It is a supremely difficult and painful situation and for all that Seydoux projects a cool and self-contained personality, her character is often very passive. She simply has to make the best of the situation with her dad and also accept it when her lover returns to his wife – waiting for his besotted texts, like a teenager. Perhaps Hansen-Løve could have given us a heroine with more agency, and she relies a little too much on Seydoux’s natural sardonic hauteur to protect her character from soppiness. But there is such a lovely chemistry between Seydoux and Greggory, and between her and Poupaud there is real erotic languor and romance.

5/20/2022,"Jerzy Skolimowski is the celebrated veteran director who first came to Cannes in 1972 with King, Queen, Knave starring Gina Lollobrigida and David Niven; now he has returned to the festival competition with a winter’s tale of a film, inspired by Robert Bresson’s Au Hasard Balthazar from 1966. I’m not sure this is my favourite Skolimowski film, but it is engaging in many ways: beautifully photographed, sentimental and surreal in equal measure; and also stubborn – as stubborn as its hero – in its symbolism and stark pessimism. Like Bresson, Skolimowski makes his lead a donkey, the beast that carried the Virgin Mary to Bethlehem and Jesus into Jerusalem. Skolimowski calls his animal “EO” – after its braying “eee-ohhh” sound. The place is present-day Poland, but the setting could almost be Europe at any time in the last few centuries. EO is being worked in a circus act but has to be let go because of legislation about using animals in this way. He winds up in a donkey sanctuary from which he is freed, then captured in the streets by a council worker for whose football team EO becomes a mascot. But, then he is beaten by hooligans supporting the opposing team, captured by a gang trading in illicit horse- and donkey-meat, and finally rescued by a troubled young aristocrat whose haughty and devout mama (a tasty cameo for Isabelle Huppert) disapproves of her son’s louche gambling ways. And, all the time, EO observes and witnesses, his innate humility and dignity rising above crass human vanity and greed. Or, is that what is happening? The film invites us to ask if it is meaningful to attribute these characteristics to EO? He does not participate in any side of our moralising human comedy. The donkey maintains his innocence, but what choice does he have in that matter? How would a donkey without innocence behave? He is, after all, simply a beast of burden. His point of view and his consciousness are mysteries. But, perhaps an alien life form, as far above humans as we are above donkeys, would regard us in the same way. And EO’s simple presence on screen is uncanny – this animal is not acting; it is being itself. But, then, perhaps we humans are deluding ourselves when we think that we can transform ourselves by the art of acting, or any other art. Skolimowski asks us to think about all this: and for all that there is something a little sugary in the movie, it is poignant and distinctive.

5/20/2022,"The UK deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, has called for ministers who were fined for breaching Covid regulations to be named by the senior civil servant tasked with investigating the Partygate scandal. Scotland Yard’s inquiries were closed on Thursday with a total of 126 fixed penalties handed out to 83 people, as it was confirmed the prime minister would not be punished further than the £50 fine he received in April for attending his birthday party in June 2020 when indoor mixing was banned. Westminster now awaits the publication of Sue Gray’s separate report into lockdown gatherings in Downing Street and Whitehall, expected next week. Boris Johnson has overhauled his Downing Street operation ahead of the report’s release, including creating a streamlined team of officials who will work under the leadership of his permanent secretary. Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Friday, Raab said there should be “transparency” in the report about any ministers who have been fined. Asked if Downing Street was trying to prevent the civil servant from publishing individual names in her report into social events at Downing Street during pandemic lockdown restrictions, Raab said that was a matter for the police and Gray. “I think that these are matters – who is identified – for Sue Gray and the Met,” he said. “What we have said is that it’s right that if there’s a minister who has been fined, of course there needs to be transparency around that. I think that’s right.” Earlier on Times Radio, Raab committed to publishing the report “as soon as possible” after it was received. Ken Macdonald told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme “we remain very much in the dark” about the details of Partygate. Lord Macdonald, who is a former director of public prosecutions, said it was not known why the prime minister was fined for being at one party but not others, or why the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, was not fined. “We don’t know who these people are, and I do feel for the junior civil servants and I quite see why they would be distressed by their names being given, but there’s a wider public interest here. “This was a major scandal at the heart of government, at the heart of the civil service, and we remain very much in the dark about who was involved, who organised the parties, and who was responsible.”",News/Politics,"Name ministers fined in Partygate, Dominic Raab urges Sue Gray",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/20/partygate-dominic-raab-sue-gray-report-name-ministers-breached-covid-rules
5/20/2022,"Late in Game 5 of the Western Conference semi-finals between the Memphis Grizzlies and the Golden State Warriors, the Grizzlies’ home crowd sure tried their damnedest to provoke the NBA’s No 1 pest. Some 18,000 fans twirled towels at the Warriors bench – and chanted along as the PA played Whoop That Trick, a local anthem. Given the deafening roar inside FedEx Forum, you’d be forgiven for thinking it was the Grizzlies who had the upper hand when, in fact, the Warriors led by 46. In the middle of this madness Draymond Green was firmly in his element: bobbing to the beat, waving a towel and really whooping it up. There’s been much debate about who’s the best remaining player in the NBA playoffs. But there is no doubt about who’s most exasperating. For the past decade the Warriors’ diminutive power forward has been a 6ft 6in thorn in the side of all who oppose him. In Wednesday night’s Western Conference finals opener against the Dallas Mavericks, Green was back to his familiar shenanigans – flexing on the floor after a tough finish at the rim, sprinting crosscourt to block a corner three, lobbying the refs and otherwise being irritating in the Warriors’ 112-87 victory at home. Green’s official contribution – 10 points, nine rebounds, three assists, two steals and that chef’s kiss closeout block on the Mavericks’ Dorian Finney-Smith – barely captures just what a pain in the ass he is to play against. If anything, these playoffs have served as a reminder of how much the 32-year-old former Michigan State standout sets the tone for the Warriors by being such a massive migraine. In the conference semi-finals against Memphis, Green was nothing but a hound dog, trying all the time. Patience, that is. He was booted from Game 1 after clobbering Grizzlies big man Brandon Clarke. Minutes into Game 2, Green caught an elbow from Xavier Tillman while grappling for a loose ball. When the FedEx Forum crowd cheered Green flipped them the double bird. (“I could have had a concussion or anything,” whinged Green, who didn’t.) But he quickly returned, and landed the knockout blows as Golden State dispatched with Memphis in five games to snap a two-year hiatus from the conference finals – a break Green described as “miserable.”. In Golden State’s first-round matchup with Denver, Green faced his stiffest challenge of the year: checking Nikola Jokić. During the regular season Green was sidelined with a lower-back injury for a personal-worst 29 games, including all four against Denver – leading to conjecture that Jokić (a two-time league MVP with a five-inch and 50lb advantage) would be too much to handle even for Green, a former defensive player of the year. Ultimately, Green didn’t completely shut down Jokić, but he did slow the Serbian down enough to prevent the Nuggets offense from operating smoothly and wipe them off the floor in five games. What’s more, Green joined LeBron James, Magic Johnson, Jason Kidd and Larry Bird as the only players in postseason history with 200 steals and 10 triple-doubles. Afterward, Green embraced Jokić on court and thanked him for making him a better player. “It was an honor and pleasure to play against someone so skilled,” Green gushed to the press afterward. It was stunningly high praise from a redoubtable trash talker. Among other disses: Green goaded a Portland player for not shooting to protect a performance bonus, and famously clapped back at Paul Pierce during a Clippers game after the Hall of Famer slammed Green and Golden State for blowing a 3-1 lead to Cleveland in the 2016 finals. “You can’t get no farewell tour,” Green crowed. “They don’t love you like that. You thought you was Kobe.” As a courtside correspondent during this year’s All-Star game, Green put down host city Cleveland as “not great” and refused to speak the name of Rudy Gobert, the Utah center who is Green’s prime competition for recognition as the NBA’s best defensive player. Green has gone at Drake and Nicki Minaj; barely a week ago Green called ex-center Kendrick Perkins an “ogre” for suggesting he’s scared to shoot and inveighed against ESPN loudmouth Chris Russo for telling him to shut up and play. (“America’s tired of Draymond Green,” Russo decried.) “I’m not one to really pull a race card very often,” Green said on his podcast, “but that definitely had a racist connotation.” For years Green had a grudge going with Charles Barkley, who once delighted in jabbing the Warriors linchpin for his “triple single” performances. So it figured that after the Warriors’ breezy Game 1 triumph against Dallas, Green joined Barkley on set outside Chase Arena as a mob of Dubs fans chanted “Barkley sucks.” When the TNT analyst, who picked against the Warriors in this series, shot back by saying how much he hates the Bay Area, Green didn’t miss a beat. “The area hates you!” quipped Green, who’s already been tapped as Barkley’s on-air apparent. And of course he’s already doing too much and claiming his job is “to save the media industry.” Green isn’t just a throwback to old-school saddle burrs like Dennis Rodman, Bill Laimbeer and Rick Fox; he’s a classic wrestling heel, constantly needling with his sharp tongue and sharper elbows. As a basketball talent, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Green holds himself in highest regard, unabashedly pronouncing himself “the best defender to ever play this game.” And while any talk that places Green in league with James, Bill Russell or David Robinson is bound to sound a touch reckless at this juncture, he is certainly the best defender remaining in the playoffs, whose versatility will be key to the Warriors’ game plan against Luka Dončić – arguably the best offensive player left in the postseason. And while they didn’t exclusively matchup against each other in Game 1, it’s only a matter of time before the player who doesn’t shoot and the player who doesn’t defend square up to swap barbs. And when that clash eventually comes, and the masses inevitably rush in to shout down basketball’s biggest troll, expect Green to keep that same energy.",Sport/Sport,Draymond Green: Basketball’s biggest troll and the Warriors’ heart and soul,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/20/draymond-green-biggest-heel-golden-state-warriors
5/20/2022,"A new membership body has been launched as part of efforts to bring people from less privileged backgrounds into senior roles across the City. The group, which will be known as “Progress Together”, will offer workshops, resources and mentoring schemes to people who might otherwise struggle to reach top-tier positions in financial services. It comes as a new survey found that employees whose parents did not have professional careers themselves were 30% less likely to reach a senior position in their firms compared with their colleagues. About nine out of every 10 senior roles in the financial services sector are held by someone from a higher socioeconomic background, which it defines as having at least one parent in a professional career by the age of 14. The disparity has led to a class pay gap in which people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds earn on average £17,500 less than their colleagues. That is the largest sector pay gap in the country, according to research by the Bridge Group. The membership body, which will focus on ensuring the progression and retention of less privileged staff, is the brainchild of a taskforce led by the City of London Corporation, which was commissioned by the Treasury and business department in 2020 to find ways to increase socioeconomic diversity in the financial sector. Catherine McGuinness, former head of policy at the City of London Corporation and chair of the taskforce, said Progress Together would “help advance our vision of a sector where performance is valued over “fit” and “polish”. The new body is starting with 12 partners, which will help organise workshops and programmes for their own staff. They include firms such as PwC, Santander, Fidelity International and Aviva. The City minister, John Glen, said the body would work with employers to help them understand the barriers to progress for staff, share best practice, identify emerging issues and push for necessary policy changes. “Research tells us that the majority of senior roles in financial services are held by those from higher socioeconomic backgrounds,” Glen said. “Financial services organisations across the UK, of all sizes, can benefit from this new membership body, ensuring that the government’s levelling up agenda is carried out, delivering equal progress and opportunity for all.”",News/Business,City scheme aims to close financial sector’s class pay gap,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/20/city-scheme-aims-to-close-financial-sectors-class-pay-gap
5/20/2022,"These Massachusetts rockers had intended their previous full-length album, 2019’s Final Transmission, as just that – a last hurrah, completing material begun with late bassist and vocalist Caleb Scofield who was killed in a car crash in 2018. But, says singer and guitarist Stephen Brodsky, the healing process of its production led to this seventh album together. Heavy Pendulum is certainly the sound of a renewed band and is, like everything they’ve recorded since 2003’s Antenna (their ill-fated attempt at commercial crossover), an unapologetically fierce beast. With amps and FX pedals dialled up to 11 and riffs so gargantuan they blot out the sun, the likes of New Reality and Blood Spiller deliver pure metal machine music, and showcase the impressive, throat-shredding howl of new bassist and second vocalist Nate Newton (of Massachusetts hardcore punk legends Converge, whose guitarist Kurt Ballou produced the album). But mere brute force has never been Cave In’s thing, and Heavy Pendulum soon tempers its pendulous heaviosity with the grace and complexity that have long been their trademark, the results evoking the grunge era’s darkly psychedelic peaks. Floating Skulls (juggling math-metal violence and heavy rock heroics) and the slow, stately roll of the title track could be the work of Soundgarden, while the vast riffs and macabre harmonies of Blinded By a Blaze suggest Alice In Chains at their most cobwebby and gothic.

5/20/2022,"Giacomo Casanova, that serial seducer of Enlightenment Europe, liked to think of himself as providing a social service. Whether it was romping in a gondola, or making out with two women at the same time (sisters were good, mothers and daughters even better) or getting it on with a girl who was passing herself off as a castrato (cross-dressing excited him), he insisted on the right of everyone involved to experience pleasure. According to Histoire de Ma Vie, the monumental and hugely priapic autobiography that he left behind at his death in 1798, Casanova very seldom resorted to violence or coercion. The worst thing that any partner might complain of was a certain post-coital tristesse which lasted only until the next sexual encounter arrived to chase it away. Veteran biographer Leo Damrosch knows just how dodgily self-deceiving all this sounds. It is hard to see how an adult man who often slept with very young girls (10 was the legal age of consent) could be read today as anything other than a paedophile. Casanova’s insistence that everything was consensual overlooks, or over-writes, the brutal power dynamics in play. While he didn’t generally sleep with sex workers, he often slept with girls who were being prostituted by their parents or their protectors in return for favours, promotion, social advantage or even just a heavy purse. Venereal disease – he refused to use a condom or, as he put it, “envelop myself in a dead skin” – was not just a hazard but could, on occasions, be weaponised. And when the inevitable happened and Casanova did sire children, he was careful to have nothing to do with them. On one occasion he ended up sleeping with his daughter Leonilda, who produced a baby boy who was, of course, also his grandson. There have been many biographies of Casanova before, some of them very good, although they have tended to be thesis driven – psychoanalyst Lydia Flem confected a Casanova who was a great understander of women while the actor and writer Ian Kelly presented him as a virtuoso performer on a social stage. Damrosch, a Harvard literary historian, is in turn clear that he is writing a post-MeToo Casanova. At the same time, he is also keen that we should understand just what a valuable document Histoire is for scholars working on the 18th century. It has only recently become available in its entirety and, despite some fantasy elements, bears unparalleled witness to the social, political and intellectual mindset of the time. Damrosch’s Casanova is above all a materialist who believes that the world you can touch and see is the only one that matters: God, while useful for keeping the hoi polloi in order, played little part in his imaginative world. If something felt good – a meal, a breast, nice clothes – then it was worth pursuing. He was also, however, a firm believer in the “one body” model of sex, which assumed that women had exactly the same appetites and drives as men (the idea of them as sexless angels would not take hold until the Victorians). More generally Damrosch shows how the patchwork boundaries of 18th-century Europe allowed a career criminal like Casanova to flit from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, changing his name, his appearance and what we would call today his “profile” as he shuttled from his native Venice to Naples to Barcelona to London and St Petersburg. As far as jobs went, he tried being an apprentice priest, a runner of lotteries, and a fiddler in an orchestra before ending up as a prisoner serving a five-year prison sentence for the somewhat vague crime of “irreligion”. By the time he was 40 both Casanova and his Histoire were running out of steam. After decades of sexual adventuring, all his conquests start to merge into one. Casanova’s final job was as librarian to Count Waldstein. The nobleman’s castle was situated in Bohemia, which sounds more promising than it turned out to be. The last dozen years of the great seducer’s life were spent in fretful celibacy complaining about the local peasantry, which, one feels, was a far better fate than he deserved.

5/20/2022,"Consumers in Great Britain carried on spending last month despite the highest inflation rate in 40 years, providing high street and online retailers with a surprise boost. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there was a 1.4% monthly jump in retail sales in April but said the trend was still weak and that part of the increase might be down to people staying in to save money. Heather Bovill, the ONS deputy director for surveys and economic indicators, said: “April’s rise was driven by an increase in supermarket sales, led by alcohol and tobacco and sweet treats, with off-licences also reporting a boost, possibly due to people staying in more to save money. “Clothing sales had a strong month, especially online, with some retailers suggesting consumers were purchasing clothes for summer holidays and weddings.” Over the three months to April – considered a better guide to the underlying trend than one month’s data – retail sales fell by 0.3% on the previous quarter. The ONS said the trend had been down since last summer. Even so, the rise in spending came as a surprise to the City, which had expected the arrival of higher national insurance contributions and the new energy price cap to lead to consumer belt-tightening last month. The consensus among economists was for a 0.2% drop in retail sales. Earlier this week, the ONS reported the annual inflation rate jumped from 7% to 9% in April, while the latest snapshot of consumer confidence from GfK showed the mood at its gloomiest since its records began in 1974. David Baker, the chief investment officer at the auditing and accounting firm Mazars, said: “April’s retail sales figures beat expectations by some distance and reverse a recent trend of falling sales. “The reading contradicts recent consumer confidence data and suggests that near full employment and the ability of consumers to tap into savings accrued during the pandemic may be preventing shoppers becoming overly cautious despite the cost of living challenges associated with high levels of inflation.” Nicholas Farr, an economist at Capital Economics, said: “The unexpectedly strong 1.4% month-on-month rise in retail sales in April suggests that the cost of living crisis hasn’t caused consumer spending to collapse and means that the economy may have a little more momentum than we thought.” The ONS said the volume of retail sales in the latest three months was just over 4% higher than before the coronavirus pandemic first affected the UK economy in early 2020. Over that period, the percentage of sales online has increased from 19.9% to 27%.",News/Business,Retail sales in Great Britain jump despite soaring inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/20/retail-sales-in-great-britain-jump-despite-soaring-inflation
5/20/2022,"Drummer and composer Sarathy Korwar has made a career of unifying unexpected collaborators. His 2016 debut album, Day to Day, featured the folk music of the Sidi community from rural Gujarat, mixing west African rhythms with Indian classical melodies, while 2017’s ARE Project was freeform jazz-dance with electronic producer Hieroglyphic Being and saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings. 2019’s More Arriving, meanwhile, paired Mumbai rap with tabla and drumkit interplay. Now Korwarteamsup with DJ and producer Brian d’Souza, AKA Auntie Flo, for this dancefloor-focused take on Indian classical. Much like the unfurling repetition of a raga, Shruti Dances plays out as a trance-inducing sequence over its six tracks, underpinned throughout by a drone produced from a shruti box, while Korwar notes time with a thumping 4/4 kick drum and electronically processed tabla rhythms. Running at just under 30 minutes, it is like a mini DJ set: we begin uptempo, with the techno-adjacent rhythmic regularity of Dha, before slowing to the swirling melodic ambience of Ga and Ma, achieving Balearic euphoria via D’Souza’s arpeggiated synths on Ni, and then closing on the pensive warm-down of Sa. The duo format, and the fact that all melody is electronic, gives Shruti Dances a certain rigidity – something that was loosened by Hutchings’ breathy saxophone on the ARE Project. Where that record was composed of edited snippets from a sprawling live improvisation, Shruti Dances is tightly constructed, placing the listener within the consistent grid of dance music, and the rhythmic minimalism of Korwar’s drumming can be claustrophobic. Within repetition, though, there is difference; repeat the same word and its sense will dissolve into something new. Korwar’s precise rhythms attune us to d’Souza’s subtle melodic changes, from splashy major chords on Ni to the spatial panning of Sa. Their collaboration challenges us to surrender to the ritualistic propulsion of their music; this is ultimately best experienced on a dancefloor – whether out-out or homemade. Ghanaian Frafra singer Linda Ayupuka releases an uptempo blend of choral chants and sparkling, 80s electro synths on God Created Everything (Mais Um). Burkinabe singer Kaito Winse joins forces with Brussels noise punk duo Benjamin Chaval and Nico Gitto as Avalanche Kaito, for their self-titled debut (Glitterbeat) – Winse’s voice soars over Chaval’s thrashing drums, an energising blend that has ample capacity to get darker and more distorted. Thai sound artist Liew Niyomkarn’s latest album, I Think of Another Time When You Heard It (Chinabot), is a beautifully calming, ambient soundscape made up of lyres and field recordings from her home town: a nostalgic blur of memory music.",Arts/Music,Auntie Flo & Sarathy Korwar: Shruti Dances review | Ammar Kalia's global album of the month,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/20/auntie-flo-sarathy-korwar-shruti-dances-review
