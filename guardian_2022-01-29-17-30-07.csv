1/29/2022,"Households in the UK are facing a cost of living crisis as the price of essential items goes up and a cut in take-home pay looms in the shape of a national insurance increase. Across the board, the latest official figures show inflation on food and drink prices was running at 4.8% in December, although that disguises bigger rises in the cost of some essentials.  In the first of a series examining the causes and effects of rising bills, we’ve looked at why some of the basic items in your supermarket basket now cost more than they did a year ago – and why there could be more pain to come. The cost of pasta has been pushed up by a rise in the price of its key ingredient: durum wheat. About two-thirds of the world’s traded durum wheat comes from Canada, and the extreme heat and drought that hit the country last year took its toll on crops. Other countries also produced lower harvests than expected, resulting in a scramble for supplies that pushed prices to a 13-year high. A 500g bag of supermarket own-brand pasta that cost about 55p in late 2020 is now typically 70p – a rise of more than a quarter. According to the website Italianfood.net, planting in Italy was delayed in the autumn as a result of drought followed by heavy rains, which could affect this year’s harvest and mean prices stay high. Ultra-cheap penne could be a thing of the past. The latest official inflation figures showed margarine and similar spreads had risen in price by more than 27% in the year to December. On the shelves at Tesco, for example, a 1kg tub of Stork has got up from £2.10 to £2.65 since last January. Meanwhile, the official figures showed cooking oils were up by 13%. It’s the oil in margarine that has pushed up the price: rapeseed and palm oil have hit record high prices in recent months. Bad weather conditions in Canada and Europe are again to blame in part, as is Covid. Rapeseed crops were hit by drought and high temperatures, while Malaysia, a big producer of palm oil, imposed restrictions on foreign workers and on the number of people at work in the industry in an attempt to slow infections. Another factor is the rise in the price of crude oil that has boosted demand for the oil crops for biodiesel. At farm level there has been a 24% increase in the cost of producing milk since January 2020, says John Allen, a managing partner at Kite Consulting. “That’s a massive rise, and the biggest since 2007-2008 when we had a spike in commodities.” Probably the biggest factor is the cost of feeding cattle, he says, which has been driven up in part by the cost of fertiliser which, in turn, has been driven up by gas prices. Farmers have also faced rising labour costs and machinery prices. “The price of producing a litre of milk has gone up from 28p in January 2020 to 35p this spring,” Allen says. Then the processors face higher costs, with energy and labour prices on the up. As a result, he says, consumers are typically paying 7p-10p more for a litre of milk. And it’s not over. Although only about 10% of milk is traded globally, the price influences what we pay for domestically produced pints. Efforts by governments in countries such as New Zealand and the Netherlands to cut dairy farming for environmental reasons means supply is falling. Demand is rising by 2% a year. That puts upwards pressure on prices. “We’ve got rising demand and we’ve got a fixed supply,” says Allen. “We think this spring there will be further increases. It wouldn’t be unrealistic to expect 20% rises – we’re in for significant inflation in dairy.” An increase in the cost of processing meat and moving it around is leading to higher supermarket shelf costs for sausages, says Sarah Baker, an economic strategist at the Agriculture & Horticulture Development Board. “Pork farmers aren’t getting good prices,” she says. “Processors are paying more for labour, there are absences because of Covid, and then there’s the rising cost of transport, with the shortage of HGV drivers and rising fuel costs.” Baker says abattoirs have struggled to replace skilled EU workers who worked as butchers and packers but have left the UK as a result of Brexit. Beef prices have been pushed up by some of the same issues, and also by demand. Throughout the pandemic, demand for products such as mince has remained high as people have cooked at home instead of eating out. “The key drivers [for inflation] are your input costs – feed and fertiliser – and labour and transport. Then you have the EU aftershock – the loss of very skilled labour. And then there’s Covid.” That morning caffeine hit will cost you more as long-term issues around climate change combine with short-term problems caused by the pandemic. The wholesale price of Arabica coffee, used in ground coffees, surged 70% last year while Robusta, more commonly used in instant, jumped 60%, according to analysts at Rabobank. This is after one of the biggest producers, Brazil, suffered from a mix of droughts and the worst frost in over two decades. The price of coffee has also been forced up by problems in global shipping. The cost of shipping a container soared 240% last year while concerns about securing deliveries prompted some buyers to stockpile. Brands tried to hold back those costs but they are now filtering through to the shelves. Almost 100 different coffee products rose in price in the supermarkets this month, according to Assosia data for The Grocer trade journal. Its survey registered some packets instant coffee rising by as much as a third in price. Others rose by a more modest 4% or 6%. It’s a tough time for salty snack lovers as the price of some of the UK’s favourite brands has shot up in the past year. The average price of Pringles, for instance, rose by 10.3%, Sensations were up by 8.8%, and Quavers up 8.5% in September last year, according to The Grocer. More recently, its first weekly grocery basket survey of 2022 showed a six-pack of Walkers crisps had gone up by 6% to £1.53. Prices are being pushed up by a host of factors, ranging from increases in oil prices and energy costs to the ubiquitous HGV driver shortages that have raised the price of distribution. The cost of producing potatoes is also on the rise, with every aspect, from labour, transport and fertiliser costs, up by more than 10%. There have also been specific problems linked to Brexit. There is a still unresolved issue on the trade in seed potatoes, which hits the trade in the export to Europe and the import of European seeds. The rising costs of paper pulp, transport and energy are all being absorbed by buyers of toilet roll and nappies. In recent weeks, manufacturers have spoken about the impact of higher input costs, and talked of plans to pass them on to retailers and consumers. Accrol, which makes toilet roll for shops including Tesco, Aldi and Morrisons, said this month it would have to put up its prices. Last week, delivering its latest set of accounts, its chief executive, Gareth Jenkins, outlined the problems: “Tissue pricing has reached unprecedented levels, driven by escalating energy costs (rising as much as 500% for certain suppliers) and global sea freight charges, combined with increased UK transport costs, resulting from HGV driver shortages.” This week Essity, which makes the Cushelle and Velvet brands, said it would be putting up prices again this year. Wood pulp prices have been driven up by shipping delays as well as changes in consumer behaviour that have boosted sales of paper products at home and demand for cardboard to pack home deliveries.",News/Business,From milk to crisps: why the price of basic food items is rising,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/29/from-milk-to-crisps-why-the-price-of-basic-food-items-is-rising
1/29/2022,"Ben Wishaw, quite apart from being one of the best British actors we have, is an expert dunker of his biscuits in tea. I’ve seen it: he’s a McVitie’s ninja, with a method all his own. We meet one afternoon in the offices of a London film company and I get the chance to observe his distinctive work first-hand, as digestive after digestive gets taken up by Whishaw, then dipped (sometimes double-handed) into a cuppa that he props on a table in front of him. Each biscuit gets submerged for so long, you suppose there’s no chance of it ever coming out whole. Each biscuit later re-emerges, sodden, milliseconds from ruin, still intact. “I’m no good at interviews,” Wishaw, 41, apologises, right away.  He has played Hamlet, Sebastian Flyte, Ariel, Paddington, James Bond’s gadget man Q; all manner of bold fictional characters behind which to hide an innate, real-world shyness. In February, Whishaw will appear in the BBC’s adaptation of Adam Kay’s bestselling medical tell-all, This Is Going to Hurt – another cocksure character, another place to hide. “I find it hard meeting people for the first time,” Whishaw shrugs. “I find it anxiety inducing. I get a shaky, unsettled feeling in my belly. Just warning you now!” And it’s true that the actor, with his wiry limbs crossed at sharp angles, the focus of his green eyes often darting away to the middle distance, comes across as socially nervous. Even so, he’s compelling company, and before the end of our conversation he’ll have spoken with careful thought and bracing honesty about sexuality; self-knowledge; LGBTQ+ casting in the film industry; his frustration with the Bond franchise, all sorts. Along the way I start to notice that, actually, there are telling parallels between the way Whishaw approaches a one-on-one interaction such as ours and his perilous technique for dunking biscuits. Whenever the conversation takes a turn, he’ll start out strong. Ideas. Confessions. Then he might lose faith and check himself (“God. I’m waffling … I have no idea what I’m saying, Tom”). Then, right when all looks lost, the biscuit doesn’t break apart, he regathers his efforts, he comes at some idea anew, and often winds up making a point that is richer and subtler than the one he started with. I ask whether being good at acting has ever helped him with his social anxiety. Can’t he use his proven performance skills (the playful sprite he played in 2010’s The Tempest, the complicated rogue in 2018’s A Very English Scandal) and fake it? “Yeah, no,” he chuckles, darkly. “I don’t find acting helps. A nightmare situation for me would be to have to make an impromptu speech at someone’s wedding. Whenever I feel like someone I know might be about to ask me to do it, I say: ‘Nope!’” Whishaw does an immaculate impression of a gruff, irritable old man. “‘Nope! Nope! Nope! Go away!’ ... Even the thought of reading a prepared speech terrifies me.” Wouldn’t reading out a prepared speech at a wedding be just like performing from a script, though? “I just don’t ever want to appear in front of other people,” Whishaw says, “and be myself.” He thinks some more. “I dunno, Tom! I’m probably talking rubbish. But sitting here, today, with you, I find the idea of my words being put down in print for ever a frightening thing. Today I could have one set of thoughts. Tomorrow another. The black-and-white of things – it clams me up.” The Bedfordshire village of Langford, where Whishaw grew up with his twin brother James and their parents, could be black-and-white in outlook. “There was definitely a keeping-up-appearances thing going on.” He was a timid young man with many unanswered questions about himself, confused about his sexuality as well as the gender norms he seemed to be expected to conform to. Some refuge was found in drama workshops at a nearby youth theatre. From about 14, he started taking regular train trips to London, mostly to watch plays. “Total theatre nut. I was about 16, I think, when I saw Mark Ravenhill’s Shopping and Fucking. I remember how much I loved arriving in London. I could feel there was another life here, another way of living. Answers. Experiences. A different community of people.” His mum Linda, who worked in retail, and his dad Jose, who worked in IT, were not artistically inclined, but they supported their son’s decision when he said he wanted to audition for drama schools in the capital. He left home at 18 when he got into Rada and moved into student digs in the north of the city. Whishaw recalls coming back to Langford for weekend visits, “and I couldn’t wait to leave again. I remember driving back on Sundays with a friend and feeling London encroaching, surrounding me – this incredible feeling of potential and possibility.” As a fresh new drama grad in 2003, he raced out on an implausibly blazing start to his acting career. He was in the original cast of His Dark Materials at the National, then almost right away (ludicrous, best-case-scenario stuff) he got to play Hamlet in a production by Trevor Nunn at the Old Vic. Critics immediately ranked him alongside the greats. Nunn and his team let Whishaw share three of the week’s nine performances with an understudy, to lessen the load on such a newbie: he was just 23. In his personal life, Whishaw remained a confused, scared and overwrought young man. It came naturally to him to portray a confused, scared and overwrought Danish prince on the London stage. “I do remember feeling like I knew what I was doing in that one,” he says. Screen work came plentifully in those early years, too. At the same time as playing Hamlet, he was filming a supporting role for Chris Morris and Charlie Brooker on the comedy series Nathan Barley. (Whishaw played the much-bullied office receptionist, Pingu.) The German director Tom Tykwer came to see him at the Old Vic and cast him as the lead in his 2006 adaptation of Patrick Süskind’s novel Perfume. In 2008 he was the rake, Sebastian, in Julian Jarrold’s big-screen Brideshead Revisited. He toured the world to film and promote these films and whenever he returned to his home in London, he remembers, he felt as excited as he’d done as a Langford teenager, riding in on that southbound train. Even so, despite the stimulation of the city and its massive human and cultural diversity, he had not yet finished reckoning with who he was. “I’m fascinated, now, by the masculine and feminine energies we carry around within ourselves,” he says. “But for years I felt I had to deny something. Because that ‘something’ was perceived as weak by the world I grew up in. Even when that ‘something’ felt quite good to me.” He didn’t feel comfortable coming out as gay to his family and friends until he was about 26 or 27, he says. “I remember sexuality weighing on me [before then]. That was really unresolved for me.” In 2008, while starring as John Keats in Jane Campion’s biopic Bright Star, Whishaw began a relationship with the film’s Australian composer, Mark Bradshaw. They married in a civil ceremony in 2012, though it took another year before Whishaw made any sort of public statement confirming this (and then in a terse few sentences that were issued through a publicist). He has never liked to talk about Bradshaw in interviews. Today, when I ask what he’s learned about himself during a decade of marriage, he stares at the ground for five, six, seven seconds before answering: “Um. Lots of things.” Another five, six, seven seconds. “I suppose I don’t feel like I’ve got to a sort of plateau of serenity, or any sort of marvellous equanimity, about everything. I don’t feel I’ve got there yet.” He ponders some more, then says: “I wonder if having children does something towards that? I think it does. I see it in my brother James. I see that if you have to think about something other than yourself, that’s extremely powerful and it changes a person. I don’t have that experience.” He laughs. “I’m still very self-absorbed. And that’s OK, I suppose.” What social life he has beyond acting, he keeps pretty private, too. No Twitter, no Instagram. Today, over a T-shirt that in its bright blue swirls gestures to one of David Hockney’s swimming pools, Whishaw wears a gold necklace inlaid with dark stones, made by a friend of his, a jewellery designer. When I ask what sort of people he likes to surround himself with, as friends, he says: “Direct people. I dig direct people. It’s really exhilarating to me when people don’t pussyfoot around or hide who they are through timidity or politeness.” I ask Whishaw about his coming out – whether he always knew who he was on the inside and felt too timid or intimidated to present himself in a truthful way to the world, or whether the uncertainty he has described was as much internal as external. “Oh, internal and external, both, yeah,” he says. “I don’t know why it took me so long. But it did.” Whishaw frowns at his cup of tea. In This Is Going to Hurt, he plays a hospital doctor who is gay and whose experience of coming out to others is a protracted thing that creates continuing ripple effects through his adult life. “I think it’s really interesting what happens to you if you grow up thinking there’s something wrong with you because you’re attracted to a certain thing,” he says. “That takes a lot of time and understanding to get over. And understanding doesn’t just arrive because you’ve been explicit and open to other people.” He asks if he’s making any sense (of course he is), then adds: “The equating of homosexuality with weakness – it’s taken a long time for me to understand there’s no reason why it should be anything of the sort. Honestly? I feel like I’m only starting to conquer that now.” While working on This Is Going to Hurt, which is set in London in 2006, Whishaw had to remind himself how much less forgiving people could be of demonstrations of affection between same-sex couples as recently as 15 years ago. Things are far from perfect in 2022, Whishaw carefully qualifies. “But I definitely remember feeling, for me at least, that it was much less easy to be tactile with a gay partner then. It’s still amazing to me that a display of affection between two men could be so distressing that someone would throw things, or tell me to ‘find a fucking room’.” I ask how those experiences made him feel at the time. Scared? Angry? “Sometimes it could be scary. But I don’t think I remember being angry. I guess I have the basic perception that if you have a problem with gay people showing each other affection, it’s because something around that issue is unresolved within yourself.” Typical that Whishaw should find ambiguity of motive even in the dickhead behaviour of some half-forgotten bully throwing rubbish at him 15 years ago. Ambiguity has always stimulated and excited him, he says. “Contradictory things. Things that don’t quite add up. Oddness. Kinks.” Certainly it’s in his most ambiguous roles that he has done his best screen work. Playing Liberal politician Jeremy Thorpe’s lover, Norman Scott, in A Very English Scandal, Whishaw somehow positioned himself as the villain of the piece as well as its desperate victim, drawing out the audience’s sympathy and disdain in alternating measures. The quality of that performance was confirmed by a rare hat-trick of awards – Emmy, Globe, Bafta – in 2019. I would suggest Whishaw even managed to invest his computer-animated Paddington (a contemporary interpretation of Michael Bond’s character that he voiced in two movies in 2014 and 2017) with hints of anarchic knowing. It was as though, in Whishaw’s hands, this clumsy domestic bear was exasperating to his adopted family, the Bonds, as much on purpose as by accident – perhaps driven by a sort of manic compulsion to create chaos and mess. “If a character is one thing, as opposed to many things, I’m not interested,” Whishaw explains. This said, it’s a surprise to me that he should ever have signed on to appear as a slightly one-note supporting player in the James Bond series. Whishaw had crossed paths with Daniel Craig in a series of early movies, 1999’s The Trench and 2004’s Enduring Love and Layer Cake. A few films into Craig’s run as Bond, Whishaw joined the extended 007 cast as its youthful and geeky weapons inventor, Q. You could say he was adopted by another Bond family, only this time a family that was much less tolerant of chaos and mess. Craig and Whishaw shared a pleasurable chemistry, as far as their scenes together in 2012’s Skyfall and 2015’s Spectre went. But by the time of last year’s No Time to Die, Whishaw had settled into the background, a space peopled by seriously good British actors (him, Naomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes, Rory Kinnear) who were kept subordinate to the scarred baddies, the expensive watches, the endless car chases and so on. Happily, there have been lots of edgier, more three-dimensional roles that have overlapped with his Bond years. Your skin crawled watching Whishaw as the toadying Uriah Heep in Armando Iannucci’s David Copperfield in 2019. He was hypnotic as a security officer going through a breakdown in the 2020 independent movie Surge. Between lockdowns he filmed This Is Going to Hurt, plainly enjoying himself as an over-confident junior doctor who patrols the obstetrics and gynaecology ward of a London hospital. Or the “brats and twats” ward, as Whishaw’s character calls it in the first 30 seconds of the show. Punchy! He had wanted to spend time on a real ward, to research the specifics of the job – “To feel it – but Covid put a stop to that. “We couldn’t go in.” There were doctors on set to consult, though, and he had Kay’s source book to turn to. In the coming dramatisation, as in the book, the narrator is a medic who always seems to know what he’s doing – but only seems to. “I would have been curious to see that contradiction play out in real life,” Whishaw says. “How doctors are when they’re chatting to colleagues, and how they are when talking to patients. They’re actors in a sense.” He stops what he’s saying to ask: “Did you find the character too unlikable, by the way?” The opening episodes of the show have just been sent to critics and other interested parties. Whishaw has started to get feedback and he says he was surprised to be asked why the audience should care for a character who was so difficult to like. “Which was so interesting to me because … am I crazy? I don’t need characters to be likable. If someone is too likable, I’m slightly repelled by them. I don’t think it’s life, being likable. It serves no one to depict life that’s likable in art.” Inside our meeting room, the table is now strewn with biscuit crumbs. Two cups of tea are down to their dregs. Outside, the production office goes about its business. A young staffer has been given one of those unenviable, near-impossible research tasks, telephoning around meteorologists and weather agencies, trying to get an answer as to where in the British Isles it will definitely snow at some distant date in 2023. Nearby, a publicist checks her emails and notices that the Bafta film awards longlist has just been published. There are lots of nominations for the cast and crew of No Time to Die, though, alas, none for Whishaw. When the actor is told this, he doesn’t blink or register any response. He’s fine. When the night of the Bond premiere came around, last September, after multiple launch delays due to Covid, Whishaw didn’t want to go. His brother persuaded him into the taxi. “James said, ‘Don’t be stupid, the whole family’s been looking forward to this, you have to.’” He and his twin have always been different characters, James bold and forthright where Ben is hesitant and shy. So he went to the premiere. He walked the red carpet. He saw to it that his family got to their seats. Then he fled. It meant Whishaw was not around to watch the scene where his character, Q, makes a passing reference to dating a man. In a thin and fleeting way, this was a moment of cinematic history. The first acknowledgment that a character in James Bond’s universe might be anything other than straight. When I saw the film, I assumed this nudge about Q’s dating preferences must be leading us somewhere in narrative terms. Perhaps the male villain, played by Rami Malek, would turn out to be Q’s date, adding an interesting wrinkle to the story of MI5’s perennial efforts to overcome evil. Or would the producers take this opportunity to chide or tease themselves for never once admitting the existence of an LGBTQ+ community in the 24 Bond films that preceded No Time to Die? In fact, the singular reference to Q’s male date (it amounted to a pronoun) was the start and end of it. I mention to Whishaw my mixed feelings about this and he asks: “What were they? I’m curious to know.” He promises he won’t be offended. He can recall only one positive text message he got about the scene, sent by Russell T Davies, who claimed he thought it was cool that Q had a boyfriend. “Otherwise, no one has given me any feedback. So I’m really interested in these questions. And I’m very happy to admit maybe some things were not great about that [creative] decision.” I lay out my own subjective response as honestly as I can. That, on the one hand, it was a relief to see some diversity of representation in this particular film franchise, which can be so creakily conservative in its mores. On the other hand, in handling the matter so timidly, in such glancing and underdeveloped fashion (Whishaw’s line could be easily scissored out of the movie on its release in less liberal territories), it created the impression of a creative decision taken grudgingly or embarrassedly – a studio with a gun to its head. Whishaw raises his eyebrows. He says: “I suppose I don’t feel it was forced upon the studio. That was not my impression of how this came about. I think it came from a good place.” He shifts in his seat, recrossing the limbs, drumming his fingers on his kneecap. He admits that he had similar concerns when the idea was first explained to him, during a one-on-one meeting with Barbara Broccoli, years ago. Later he was shown a partial script. “And I think I remember feeling something like what you’ve just described. I think I thought, ‘Are we doing this, and then doing nothing with it?’ I remember, perhaps, feeling that was unsatisfying. “For whatever reason, I didn’t pick it apart with anybody on the film,” Whishaw continues. “Maybe on another kind of project I would have done? But it’s a very big machine. I thought a lot about whether I should question it. Finally I didn’t. I accepted this was what was written. And I said the lines. And it is what it is.” Before our time together winds down, I ask him about a more interesting, certainly more complicated movie he made a few years ago: Tom Hooper’s The Danish Girl, in which Eddie Redmayne starred as a trans pioneer, Lili Elbe, and Whishaw took a supporting role as one of Lili’s lovers. Redmayne has long wrestled with his decision to take on this part that might have gone to a trans actor. A few weeks before my meeting with Whishaw, Redmayne went on record calling it a categoric mistake – that he would not take the role if offered it today. I ask Whishaw what he makes of the years of contention that have surrounded this movie since its release in 2015. Typically, in his long answer, Whishaw starts off strong; he panics; he ends up somewhere rather modest and lovely and wise. “I think Eddie did a beautiful job,” he says. “And it’s done. Going forward, there will be other films in which the role is given to someone who lived that experience. Why shouldn’t a role like that be given to someone who knows, inside, what the character is? I’m all for that. I feel the same, sometimes, about straight actors playing gay parts. I’m critical if I don’t think the performance is, from my subjective experience, accurate. I might think, ‘I don’t believe you!’ And even a small moment of hesitation or inauthenticity will block my engagement with the whole story. So I understand these questions.” He hesitates. “Am I making sense? This is why I clam up! I just feel that we can end up arguing over these black-and-white things and get extremely polarised over these questions when I don’t think it needs to be that way. Have a discussion! There can be disagreement! There can be different points of view!” Finally, Whishaw gets where he’s going. “As I said before, I love contradictory things. Ambiguity. And if we look, if anyone takes a moment to look inside themselves about how they’re thinking or feeling on a subject, they’ll immediately see all manner of things that are not consistent. So I’m on the side of listening to each other. And I’m on the side of forgiving each other. We have to believe in listening and forgiveness,” he says, “don’t we?”  This Is Going to Hurt starts on 8 February at 9pm on BBC One and BBC iPlayer.",Arts/Culture,"Ben Whishaw: ‘Sometimes, with straight actors ­playing gay parts, I think: I don’t believe you!’",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/29/ben-whishaw-straight-actors-gay-parts-this-is-going-to-hurt
1/29/2022,"The internal email dropped into staff inboxes at a time when public outrage about pollution in English rivers was in full cry, generating parliamentary debates, demonstrations and mass petitions. But within the agency responsible for protecting and enhancing the environment the focus was on gagging staff with the threat of dismissal if they discussed its work both inside and outside the organisation.  Chief executive James Bevan, a former Foreign Office mandarin who was appointed in 2015 to run the regulator, issued a draconian warning silencing staff after a wave of criticism about its performance protecting rivers. Staff should not, he said, “openly criticise or discredit the organisation in the media or on social media” or “disclose any confidential information in connection with the Environment Agency to anyone who is not authorised to received it”. All breaches could lead to disciplinary action or, in serious cases, dismissal. Comments made “inside or outside work”, including derogatory statements about the organisation, managers, colleagues, stakeholders, customers or contractors, and anything that brought the agency into disrepute, or reflected on its performance, were all subject to sanction. Although pressures on the agency and its staff have grown each year as its government grant has been incrementally slashed by nearly two-thirds, this threat from Bevan marked a nadir. “It is desperate,” said Nick Measham of Salmon and Trout Conservation. “It shows a lack of confidence and suggests a very unhappy workplace.” Why Bevan felt compelled to issue his message when he did can perhaps be traced back to a few weeks before in November last year, when staff were given formal instructions to shut down and stop investigating low level pollution events, so-called level 3 and 4 incidents. The memo, seen by the Guardian, clearly laid out the dire state of the organisation’s investigative and enforcement capabilities. “We do not have sufficient funding to continue to provide our current level of environment management incident response and have made it clear to government that you get the environment you pay for,” it read. “As a result, we have decided to reduce our response to unfunded low and no impact environmental incidents.” The memo admitted this would not be popular with the public, many of whom work as volunteers to plug gaps in Environment Agency monitoring of rivers to track pollution. “This is not an easy transition and our officers and advisers are facing criticism from our customers for the reduction in our service,” it read. The axing of core pollution detection work was something environmental charities suspected had been in play for a while. Michelle Walker of the Rivers Trust said: “Anecdotally we had heard for some time that they just won’t come out to a pollution incident unless there are dead fish, for example, or unless there are the right number of dead fish. But the fact that they are now formally making that policy is shocking.” For frontline staff, the individuals whose task is to go out and investigate pollution, identify polluters and make them accountable, it was, insiders said, another example that their work was not a priority in the EA. Multiple and repeated complaints to managers had been made internally about the move away from frontline responses for some time, the Guardian has been told. Some staff have carried on doing the work, only to face reprimands from managers. Insiders point out that attending level 3 and 4 pollution incidents can prevent higher risk pollution incidents in future. A staff survey carried out in October and November reflected the dismay, revealing increasing levels of workplace stress and low morale, with staff struggling with their mental health. After 26 years as a statutory regulator the agency has moved in the last two decades away from its frontline enforcement and monitoring role. In 2009 it changed its policy to allow water companies to self monitor their own discharge and report breaches, rather than their own staff visiting and taking their own independent samples. The conviction of Southern Water last year for deliberately discharging billions of litres of raw sewage into the sea, and covering up its actions by very significant under-reporting of the pollution, has not led to a change in this policy. As government funding for its environmental protection work continues to decline; from about £170m in 2009-10 to £94m last year the gaps are increasingly being filled by charges to the industries and businesses the agency regulates, including water companies and waste firms – £330m in 2021/2. Whistleblowers speaking to the Guardian say the money within the agency has shifted as a result from the officers investigating and monitoring pollution to middle managers dealing with the businesses being regulated who increasingly provide the funding for its work. Between 2013 and 2018, monitoring of water quality in freshwater environments was halved from 10,797 sites to 4,656, according to data collated by Salmon and Trout Conservation and a farmer can only expect a visit from an EA officer once every 263 years, by the agency’s own admission. “These management teams now appear to be directly funded by businesses we regulate, at the expense of the teams that are tasked to carry out the investigation and enforcement,” said one insider. “The overall feeling is that this has not happened by accident but that water quality is no longer a priority and the environment in most cases is expendable,” another source told the Guardian. “There appears to be a direction aimed at working alongside water companies, industry and agriculture, rather than regulating them. The EA is as far removed from the polluter pays principle as it has ever been, and what is most concerning is that this appears to be by design.” Prosecutions by the agency in the decade to 2020 have fallen dramatically. Civil sanctions, known as enforcement undertakings, have increasingly been used since 2010; they are a voluntary legally binding agreement that avoids anyone being held criminally responsible and instead requires an offender to pay a financial contribution towards the environment. “We have a situation where court actions for water offences brought by the EA fell from 235 in 2002 to 20 in 2019 to three in 2020,” said Caroline Lucas, the Green MP and member of the parliamentary environmental audit committee. “Something is clearly going wrong and there is a clear conflict of interest when the agency is left so dependent on income from the permits paid for by the very companies that it’s meant to be regulating.” Tom Burke, co-founder of the environmental consultancy E3G, said the shift in policy was the result of a deliberate political plan to weaken environmental regulation by stealth. “The agency is set up in statute so any effort to close it would require primary legislation, which would run into a hurricane of opposition,” he said. “By taking away its budgets and independence you get a nice label for the gutless business service organisation we see today.” Increasingly, however, the response of the public seems to chime with the apparent frustrations and discontent of frontline staff. From residents who live near polluted landfill sites to river users pushing for cleaner waterways to coastal communities setting up their own groups to monitor the regular discharges of raw sewage by water companies, the view is the agency is not doing enough to stop pollution, bring polluters to account and protect the environment. As Amy Slack of Surfers Against Sewage told MPs recently: “We have never seen greater awareness and appetite for change as we are now … people do not want to be swimming and playing in polluted water and are generally shocked when they find out the extent of the problem.” An EA spokesperson said: “The Environment Agency delivers a massive amount for the country – like the rest of the public sector we operate within a tight budget and must prioritise to ensure we are doing the best we can, with the money we have, for the people and places we serve.”",News/Environment,‘It is desperate’: how Environment Agency staff were silenced as pollution worsened,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/29/it-is-desperate-how-environment-agency-staff-were-silenced-as-pollution-worsened
1/29/2022,"Love, power, agony and death – throughout its history opera has been cherished for its displays of unbridled passion. But for those enacting scenes of murder, sex and sometimes even rape, words like consent and agency have rarely come up. Now, in what’s thought to be a British first, the Royal Opera House (ROH) is consulting with Ita O’Brien – an intimacy coordinator who ensures actors feel comfortable during such scenes – for Katie Mitchell’s new production of Theodora, opening on Monday.  George Frideric Handel’s oratorio – about a Christian martyr who is forced into prostitution, threatened with rape and executed by Roman authorities – first premiered at the Covent Garden venue 250 years ago. For Julia Bullock, a soprano who plays the titular role, it’s a symbolic and vital moment. “I’ve been in so many rehearsal spaces where usually it’s the performers who are making complaints about scenes, but to have that preemptively addressed was such a relief,” she said. “In opera, there’s so much attention given to the craftsmanship of the music, the set design, the direction of the singing and choreography, in order to allow human moments to become amplified on stage. But that also means we need to take care of the human beings who are embodying those moments.” Bullock said she’s had a number of challenging experiences in the past, when she was put at unnecessary physical and psychological risk during intimate scenes. “One of the first things Ita talked about was how only those directly involved in an intimate scene should be in the room for its staging. But I remember during my first ever intimate performance, my partner and I were being witnessed by 50 people, and the conductor was asking, ‘Shouldn’t Julia be simulating more noises on stage?’” And where traditionally, she’s been left alone with a partner to explore how to stage a scene, now those conversations take place before anyone takes to the stage. “You explore whether a man can touch your breasts, whether it’s comfortable. You go step by step over parts of the body that may be exposed or are going to be subjected to intimate touch, allowing your body to register if there’s anything that is hypersensitive, or if there’s a place where you might potentially be triggered.” Since the revelations against Harvey Weinstein, intimacy coordinators have become more commonplace on sets. But while scenes on TV and film can often be completed in a couple of takes, a live show is repeatedly played out in front of thousands of people each evening. O’Brien, who has worked on hit TV shows including I May Destroy You, Normal People and It’s A Sin, as well as on recent plays such as Spring Awakening at the Almeida and Manor at the National Theatre, said the scale was wholly different. “There’s consent each and every day. You might agree one day that you’re very happy to kiss lip to lip, and then you develop a cold sore, so it’s not suitable any more. So you explore what the moment is about, different ways to tell the same story,” she said. “There’s been concern that if you bring in guidelines, you dumb down creativity, but actually it’s the opposite because you invite that open conversation.” But even for O’Brien, who has trained as a ballet dancer and worked as an actor herself, opera has been a learning curve. “For example, you have to make sure the positions you put performers in doesn’t interrupt their beautiful sound.” “Opera,” she added, was “the most heightened art form, and because it was mostly written from history and mostly by men, power plays are a big part of the narrative. So to help bring female empowerment to Theodora has been really rewarding.” Oliver Mears, Director of Opera at ROH said the company was “committed” to making intimacy direction an integral part of future productions. “When staging new commissions and reimagining repertory operas, it is critical that artists, creatives and ROH staff feel safe and supported,” he said. “Many of the most celebrated operas explore themes of exploitation, sexual violence, and abuse of power, and it is vital to us that we approach these topics sensitively and with care in the rehearsal room, ensuring our artists can perform at their best.”",Arts/Culture,Royal Opera House hires intimacy coordinator,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/29/royal-opera-house-hires-intimacy-coordinator-ita-obrien-handel-theodora-sex-scenes
1/29/2022,"It was September 2009, and I was anxiously waiting to head off to university. My friends had already all left and my small home town in Wales felt even more claustrophobic than before. It was also the month I downloaded a relatively new music streaming service called Spotify. I was immediately in heaven. I’d sneaked in just before they ended a free sign-up offer and so, for precisely zero pounds, I suddenly had access to a musical library that had previously been unthinkable.I made a playlist titled, very imaginatively, “September 09”, and added all the songs I was listening to at the time. The soundtrack to my small-town angst? Frank Turner’s This Town Ain’t Big Enough for the One of Me and Bright Eyes’ First Day of My Life. I soon made it to university and, even now, listening to December 09 (Emmy the Great, LCD Soundsystem, Frightened Rabbit) gives me an almost painful pang of nostalgia for evenings in my grotty but much-loved student bedroom, with the new friends I’d made.  If I’d been born a few years earlier, I’m sure I’d have been painstakingly making mixtapes (I still remember my excitement at about the age of 10 when we got a CD burner and I could produce my own compilation discs), but Spotify let me carefully curate playlists quickly and easily. Sure, it wasn’t quite as romantic as a custom-made cassette with a hand-drawn cover, but it had its own charms. Looking back through the playlists, which I’ve kept going to the present day, is like reading a map of my experiences. You can spot heartbreaks, where the playlists are dominated by sad indie music; you can track the recovery, when strong female artists such as Amy Winehouse, Self Esteem and Julia Jacklin start to dominate. The average BPM definitely rises in 2012 when I started running more, and there’s a brief foray into some dodgy 2000s worship music when I became a Christian in 2015 (I later discovered that there was some less cringey contemporary stuff to be found). More recently, you can see a surge in classical music and film soundtracks from “March 20” onwards, as the pandemic turned my kitchen table into an office and I used music to help me focus.I adore this musical autobiography, which has endured far longer than any attempt at keeping a diary. But it does tie me to one particular company – and an increasingly controversial one at that. The streaming giant is currently in the news because of Neil Young’s demand that his music be pulled from the platform in protest against its hosting of Joe Rogan’s podcast, the Joe Rogan Experience, which Young believes spreads vaccine misinformation. (Rogan has a $100m deal with Spotify for exclusive streaming rights to his show, and it’s listed as the most popular podcast on the platform.) This comes after 270 experts in the US signed an open letter to Spotify expressing concern about medical misinformation on Rogan’s podcast. Do I like the idea of the £9.99 a month I now pay funding possible misinformation about vaccines during a pandemic? No. And on top of that, services like Spotify are often criticised by artists who point out they can’t live off the royalties they receive from streaming. None of this is great if you care as much about music as I – and so many of us – do.So what should I do? I’m yet to be convinced that other streaming platforms offer anything that can really compete, and many of the issues with Spotify may still apply to them. There is, of course, the resurgent popularity of vinyl, which is wonderful to see – I myself am the proud owner of a growing collection. But I dread to imagine how much it would cost to replace my playlist collection if I wanted to own physical copies on vinyl (or even CD). Plus, I’m not sure how my gym would feel about me carting them along to accompany me on a workout.Ultimately, however, it’s the collection of playlists I’ve built since I was 18 that keeps me subscribing, and I imagine there are many other members of Generation Spotify who feel the same. That’s why I struggle with the idea of dumping Spotify – in doing so, I’d be burning 13 years of musical diaries, a personal, evocative and immersive account of my whole adult life.

1/29/2022,"Period features were conspicuously absent from Becky Nolan and Barny Read’s flat-hunting wishlist. The couple, who run the Peanut Vendor, a 20th-century design store in east London, were living in a Victorian flat but decided a more modern space would better showcase their collections of abstract art and esoteric furniture. “We were ready for a change from bay windows and wonky walls; we wanted to try an art gallery-style white box,” Read says. They found a two-bedroom flat built in the 1990s to rent and were hooked by its two small terraces, front and back. The flat itself was uninspiring. “It was nondescript and a bit tired, with lots of magnolia,” Nolan recalls. But a quick peep under the beige carpets revealed a concrete screed floor: “We thought that had potential,” Read says.  With their landlady’s approval, they painted the walls brilliant white, resin-coated the concrete floor and removed and stored the existing fittings, “so we can reinstate them when we leave”. They swapped faux Victorian metal door handles for vintage Bakelite ones, fussy curtains for crisp white linen, and replaced pendant lights with mid-century glass designs. These “sit flush against the ceiling to maximise the sense of height and give continuity to each room,” Read says. The couple’s landlady had been planning to replace the kitchen and bathroom floors, so the couple were able to steer her towards terracotta quarry tiles, which match the tiles on the canal-side terrace. But there have been compromises. “There were limits to what we could do,” Nolan says. “We just have to live with kitchen and bathroom fittinngs that wouldn’t be our choice.” When they moved in, the plan was to create an uncluttered look. “We had big ideas about being minimalist, having a lot of empty white space,” Nolan recalls with a laugh. “But we are natural collectors: we love art and are always finding new pieces.” Much of it is surprisingly large for a small flat, such as a big abstract painting that sits alongside a low-slung 1970s sofa by Vico Magistretti, or an amorphic ceramic sculpture in the small hallway. “Whether it’s sculpture or a painting, we like to have some huge things that mess with the sense of scale,” Nolan says. “It actually makes the room feel bigger.” With its white walls and focus on art and sculpture, the flat does have a contemplative, gallery-like atmosphere, but tactile rugs and warm woods prevent it from feeling sterile. The couple’s choice of pieces to sell at the Peanut Vendor is just as carefully thought out. “When we’re looking for stock, we ask ourselves if we would have this in our home,” Read says. In a crowded market of mid-century design dealers, the couple are constantly striving to find unexpected and challenging pieces, from a post-modern Italian armchair with a red leather sunburst motif to chunky wooden chairs. “These one-off pieces always seem to sell quickly,” Nolan says. They source many of their pieces at trade-only fairs in France, where dealers gather from across Europe. “We go to flea markets too, if there’s time. We used to go for a lot of Scandinavian design; now we’re into Italian modern and post-modern pieces.” Their thoughtful edit has attracted an appreciative following among influential interior designers such as Kelly Wearstler and Faye Toogood, who snap up vintage pieces to bring depth to their projects. The Peanut Vendor name comes from an old Cuban jazz song. “We just liked it and didn’t want anything that tied us down to a particular genre or era,” says Read. Starting the business, in 2008, was a leap of faith for the couple, who were then just a year into their relationship. “We began with a small shop and spent time looking at what other dealers were doing,” Read says. “We saw that many just had a basic holding page website. I think our big strength was to have a proper online shop from the start.” In the early days, they had to bolster their finances by working in pubs. “It took us about four years to really learn the business side,” Nolan says. In 2015 they upgraded to a large showroom. It’s open by appointment, which frees them up for buying trips in France and Italy. “We’ve had no problem selling over the past two years, but it’s been harder to buy stock and, with Brexit, it’s also more of a challenge,” Read says. “Now we need to arrange shipping, permits and paperwork, which many of our dealers just aren’t set up for. It’s will make everything more complicated, and expensive.” On a more positive note, Nolan has used the lockdowns to become an accomplished ceramicist. “A friend bought me a course at Turning Earth studio a few years ago. I loved it, but I didn’t get a chance to touch clay again until the first lockdown. It’s very soothing.” She began at the dining table, taking her pieces to a local potter for firing, but quickly outgrew this way of working, so the couple transformed their guest bedroom into a small studio, complete with an old portable kiln that they wheel outside to use. Inspired by traditional pots from ancient Greece and Africa, as well as the work of artist Cy Twombly and potter Magdalene Odundo, Nolan documents her efforts on Instagram and has started to sell pieces online. Within 12 months her pots had appeared in Elle Decoration. The ceramics sit happily within the mix in the flat: “I love creating new vignettes of pieces: it keeps things fresh and inspiring. I could go for a Victorian flat again, but for now we really like the contemporary feel. It suits the art and furniture we love, and we’re just enjoying this pleasing white cube of a space.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘There was a lot of magnolia’: a couple’s revamped flat shows renting needn’t mean bad design,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/29/a-couples-revamped-flat-shows-renting-neednt-mean-bad-design
1/29/2022,"At least 10 times a month, I receive a message on social media from an anxious woman unsure about which products she should ditch while pregnant. This is an inevitable consequence of the boom in active skincare ingredients and its resulting landslide of misinformation, coupled with US pregnancy websites and apps so litigation-averse that they seemingly deem everything but air a hazard to the unborn child. If you’re newly with-child and keen to rejig your routine, there is not very much that becomes off-limits. As with anything in pregnancy (weightlifting and sushi bingeing, for example), the main thing is not to choose now as the time to start something dramatically new. For instance, if you’re already using a vitamin C serum (considered safe in pregnancy), carry on. But it’s not hugely sensible to introduce a strong one from scratch at a time when your skin may be more sensitive (sunscreens are safe, but if you’re sensitive to synthetic SPF, switch to mineral SPF for a bit).  Exfoliating acids are another category that sparks fear, but this is unfounded. Alpha hydroxy acids, such as glycolic and lactic, are fine; beta hydroxy acid (salicylic) is not recommended in large quantities, but you won’t find those quantities in any over-the-counter skincare product. So your daily salicylic toner is fine. A chemical peel in a doctor’s office is not the most sensible (or likely) decision. I’d probably skip a BHA body lotion (uncommon anyway), if you slather on daily and abundantly. There is a relatively short list of products that should not be used: retinoids in all forms (retinol, retinyl palmitate, tretinoin, retinaldehyde and so on) are out until breastfeeding is finished. Pigmentation-busters hydroquinone and arbutin are also off the menu. (Azalaic acid and niacinamide, both effective on discolouration issues so common in pregnancy, are green-lit.) Finally, there is absolutely no good reason to switch from synthetic skincare products to natural in pregnancy (essential oils can actually irritate sensitive skin). It’s also worth remembering that the reason many things are not recommended in pregnancy is not because we know them to be dangerous, but because we hardly ever test anything on pregnant people and so have no way of knowing. And that none of the above is to replace your own doctor’s advice. Only they know the particulars of your health and pregnancy.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Newly pregnant?

1/29/2022,"The uncertainties of the pandemic might have skewered plans to host a hybrid festival – it was originally hoped to combine an in-person event in Park City, Utah with an online option – but certain Sundance truths remain inviolable. Key among them is the fact that even without the heady effect of all that mountain air, and despite a selection this year that is unlikely to go down as one for the ages, Sundance buzz remains a powerful force with the potential to propel a small film to big results. This year, however, there is little that has combined crowd-pleasing credentials with critical consensus. Perhaps the main contender for crossover success is Cha Cha Real Smooth, the second film from American Gen Z wunderkind Cooper Raiff (Shithouse), who wrote, directed and stars in a sweet, funny and almost painfully earnest drama about a directionless 22-year-old college leaver (an endearingly puppyish Raiff) who falls hard for Dakota Johnson’s thirtysomething divorcee with an autistic daughter. On paper, it’s an archetypal Sundance movie – emotionally engaging, honest, with just a hint of grit – but my gut says that some slightly sniffy reviews have misjudged the broad appeal of this one.  It’s a rare film that manages to capture a specific generational angst while also connecting across the board. It helps that the chemistry between Raiff and Johnson is explosive. But then so is the chemistry between Johnson and Sonoya Mizuno, who plays her best friend in Am I OK?, a gentle comedy directed by Tig Notaro and Stephanie Allynne, written by Lauren Pomerantz, about a young woman who belatedly realises that she’s attracted to girls. On recent evidence, it seems likely that Johnson could be cast opposite a loaf of bread and still melt the screen with the force of her languid, smouldering gaze. Cha Cha Real Smooth is one of several films that deal with one of this year’s recurring Sundance themes: age-gap romances. Markedly less benign and cosy is Palm Trees and Power Lines, the accomplished and profoundly uncomfortable feature debut from Brooklyn-based (female) director Jamie Dack. Featuring a revelatory performance from newcomer Lily McInerny, it follows 17-year-old Lea – disconnected, bored and neglected – as she embarks on a romance with Tom (Jonathan Tucker), a man twice her age. At least she thinks it’s a romance. What becomes sickeningly clear as the film progresses is that Tom is grooming her. It’s not an easy watch – one extended shot in a hotel room is almost unbearable – but this is undoubtedly one of the festival’s standouts. Another picture that deals with age gaps, albeit less successfully, is Lena Dunham’s belated follow-up to her 2010 mumblecore breakthrough Tiny Furniture. Sharp Stick follows a naive young woman on a journey of sexual self-discovery, but its queasy tone drew a collective “yikes” from most critics. There has been a strong showing of British productions this year, notably Ed Perkins’s The Princess, an archival documentary telling the story of Diana, Princess of Wales, entirely through news clips, period commentary and amateur footage. It’s a similar approach to that employed by Asif Kapadia in Amy, and it brings freshness and intimacy to a story that’s been told and retold innumerable times. Also impressive is Living, Oliver Hermanus’s classy, 1950s, London-set remake of Akira Kurosawa’s Ikiru, starring Bill Nighy as a buttoned-up civil servant who belatedly finds a purpose and joy in life after having received a terminal cancer diagnosis. With costumes by Sandy Powell, this is one of the most handsome pictures in the Sundance selection and seems like a potential contender for awards next year. The standout for me, though, is a micro-budget comedy drama from Wales, about a lonely inventor who creates a robot from bits of an old washing machine. Brian and Charles is written by and stars David Earl and Chris Hayward, the latter enclosed in an unwieldy box to play the robot. It’s an oddball delight of a film that takes its silliness utterly seriously and is all the funnier for it. In a Sundance programme that has had no shortage of high-quality performances, I was particularly taken by Aubrey Plaza’s career-best turn in John Patton Ford’s propulsive debut, Emily the Criminal. She plays a young woman sinking into debt, but whose criminal record prevents her from working at anything more lucrative than a food delivery service. A combination of desperation and inclination means that when she gets the opportunity to make quick money through credit card fraud, she grabs it. And she’s good at it. A taut, tough little thriller, this is a perfect showcase for Plaza’s hard-as-nails physicality and irresistible bad-girl minxiness. The real discovery of this year’s festival, however, is one of its more ambiguous and unusual films. You Won’t Be Alone, by the Australian writer-director Goran Stolevski, is set in 19th-century Macedonia, in a culture steeped in folklore and superstition. A child whose soul is stolen by a witch rejects the path that has been assigned her, instead taking the form of a series of people and animals (including Noomi Rapace, at one point) in an attempt to relearn what it is to be human. The shape-shifting poetry of the film, its visual lyricism and the use of an enigmatic voiceover have drawn comparisons with the work of Terrence Malick. But in this case, references to other film-makers don’t do the picture justice. You Won’t Be Alone is thrillingly and emphatically its own thing, whatever form it chooses to take.",Arts/Film,From age-gap romances to a homemade Welsh robot: the best of Sundance 2022,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/29/sundance-film-festival-2022-roundup-review
1/29/2022,"Paula Robinson lives on a neat suburban cul-de-sac of 1930s houses that also contains the remains of a gateway to a mighty Roman fort once occupied by the Asturian cavalry regiment from northern Spain. Around the corner is the Temple of Antenociticus. Last year archaeologists found ancient pottery and deer bones in Robinson’s garden, which is close to one of Newcastle’s busiest roads, West Road. Exciting but not totally surprising as the house is on the site of Condercum, a huge hilltop outpost of Hadrian’s Wall.  All of which, campaigners argue, can be easily missed by the estimated 10,000 walkers who annually follow the 84-mile Hadrian’s Wall trail across the north of England. When the trail gets close to the wonders of the surviving wall it veers away from the city’s west end down to the River Tyne before reaching them. “I’m sure the trail doesn’t go down the West Road because they thought the river was prettier,” says Chi Onwurah, the Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central. “It may well be prettier, but it’s not where the wall was.” Onwurah is due to bring the matter up in a Westminster Hall debate on Tuesday, calling for the trail to be rerouted. She says it is an important issue given the synergies between the area in Roman times and how it is today. In Hadrian’s day the area was urban and multicultural “which is also how the west end is today,” she says. “We need to celebrate Hadrian’s Wall being in the west end of Newcastle and by doing that you’ll understand more about Britain in Roman times and also more about Britain today.” Hadrian’s Wall this year celebrates its 1,900th birthday, marked by a yearlong series of events under the banner of the 1900 festival. The perfect time, Onwurah believes, to right a wrong. Precisely why the trail does not go down West Road is unclear, though it is fair to say a walk along the road – with its constant traffic and litter problems – is not everyone’s idea of a fun day out. Onwurah says parts of the west end had some of the highest levels of multiple deprivation in the UK. “It is a vibrant, multicultural but yes economically deprived area of the city,” she says. “There may well have been an element of snobbishness in the past as there was about many aspects of our cultural history, but I think the 1900 celebrations are a really great opportunity to represent the wall as it was.” Onwurah will on Tuesday submit a series of requests to the government to better promote the wall in Newcastle. “This is about making sure the story of our nation from Roman times represents our present as well as our history.” The MP’s intervention is welcome news to Rob Higgins, a local councillor, who is out walking a friend’s yorkshire terrier, Daisy, on the impressive foundations of Denton Hall turret on the corner of West Road and the A1. He remembers the trail coming to Newcastle two decades ago. “We were never consulted,” he says. “I think it was about trying to have a route which went along the river and the main arteries should be avoided.” He too thinks there might be an element of snobbishness but stresses: “Some of the stories about the west end of Newcastle are grossly exaggerated.” Higgins says Roman forts such as Vindolanda and Housesteads get all the Hadrian’s Wall attention and “to our frustration the sections in Newcastle get forgotten about”. He is keen to ensure the west end is a key player in the 1900 festival. “We’ve already got some really exciting projects involving people from the local community and schools, which will not only commemorate the event but highlight the history of the wall along the West Road.” Overall responsibility for the trail lies with Natural England, sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Defra, however, says decisions on the route are a matter for the trail partnership. Northumberland national park authority, which manages the route and is one of the trail partners, has been approached for comment. Robinson, a retired Northumbria police employee, says her estate in Benwell does get tourists, but many more would be welcome. “It would be lovely to have more people who appreciate history. “The wall here is everywhere, the whole area. I don’t know why it’s not called Little Italy.”",News/UK news,‘We need to celebrate it’: Newcastle seeks its place on Hadrian’s Wall trail,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/29/newcastle-deprived-west-end-seek-boost-hadrians-wall-west-road-roman-remains
1/29/2022,"One day, Osman Yousefzada’s parents removed him from school for six months and took him back to where they were born, on the banks of the Indus. His father had often returned, but his mother had not, and while Osman gazes at jewellery-laden women, at villages that are a “puzzle of alleyways in permanent shadow”, at rounds of Kalashnikov bullets fired into the air at weddings in these border territories between Pakistan and Afghanistan, she caught up on her dead. Taken to England as a young girl, with only a few hours’ warning, she had not been able to say goodbye. Osman, who in England often wondered at how his vivid mother was intermittently flooded with sadness, watches her at her family’s graves. “My heart was inside hers: finally, I understood the crying.” One of the many arresting things about this arresting memoir is the way in which Yousefzada manages information: like Leo in the LP Hartley novel that lends his book its title, Yousefzada is, for most of it, a child. He sees what a perceptive child sees, which is not the same as understanding it (though of course the reader understands, and that generates tension). And what he sees is Balsall Heath, Birmingham, in the 1970s and 80s, when housing was cheap enough for recent immigrants – West Indians, Rastafarians, Ugandans, Bangladeshis, Hindus, Sikhs, Muslims, Pakistanis, Irish. Ali Campbell from UB40 lives at the end of the street; sex workers tout for custom in front of mosques. Yousefzada’s own orthodox Pathan community is “the most covered and the least integrated in south Birmingham”, the men and women within this separation strictly separated again. But childhood gives him (and us) an all-areas pass. He is a skilled guide, building a rich world of hiding places, of smells, feet at prayer – and clothes.  Yousefzada’s mother was a gifted seamstress; it was, writes her son, “like watching a magician”. He is now a designer who has dressed A-listers from Beyoncé to Lady Gaga, and an artist who has exhibited at the Whitechapel Gallery and the V&A, but this is where it began – watching his mother cut patterns freehand, embroidering cuffs and necklines, weighing up fabrics and colours. Generations of children have dressed Barbies for role-play; only a handful will have used offcuts of green devoré. As he grew older, he began to see what this gift meant to his mother: self-expression, pride in personal achievement, and community. She could not go out, but all sorts of women came to her. Often they stayed, and talked. Men were drab, distant, frightening, but to Osman, increasingly his mother’s confidante, the world of women was a “full-blown epic, of tragedy, pathos, colour, jewellery and clothes”. He began to be sent on errands. He picked fabrics, chose shoes, gained a reputation for discerning taste. And brought back news of the outside world, which, apart from the corner shop, F Allen’s, was for him largely non-white. Not even at school did this change: the brown and Black kids were streamed into lower sets regardless of ability (and Yousefzada’s was high). But when the other world broke through, it did so with a vengeance: Thatcher’s complaints about being “swamped” by immigration, marauding skinheads, graffiti reading “Pakis go home”. This begins to complicate Yousefzada’s understanding of the masculinity he fears – his father’s violence and inaccessibility, the religiosity of the bearded believers, or “Bushmen” as he called them. These were men brought over to labour, many of whom worked decades without a holiday. Now factories were closing, serving them “with redundancy papers they couldn’t read”, and they retreated into worship and “the consolation of our culture, our dignity”. There is a moving moment when an English-born son asks why they have to fly a recently deceased man to Pakistan when all his family are in Britain. “He needs to be buried … in the earth of his birth,” comes the reply. “In the land where he was respected, not where he was spat upon.” Yousefzada, who mourns his ejection, at 12, from the women’s quarters, “where the joy and colour came from”, is honest about how long it took him, as a male, to notice the effect this religiosity had on his sisters, who were taken out of school at 10 or 11 and confined to the house. He remembers a woman unable to comfort a son dying in the street because she was not allowed to cross her own threshold; the terrible fates of those accused of being barren, or “loose”. He tells these tragedies plainly, letting them speak for themselves in this narrative full of lovely lines, often further lifted by a light irony – a man “visibly inflating with sagacity”, for instance, or another, a religious purist partial to attar of saffron, musk and jasmine, who “always appeared to be there even when he wasn’t”. When the Bushmen run the pimps and prostitutes out of their neighbourhood, Yousefzada registers that he misses one girl in particular, who always said hello. “However, God’s work was done, and the house prices began to rise.” “I have cleansed some of my feelings in this ritual writing,” Yousefzada notes in his acknowledgments, and the effect when writing about himself, about his escape to Soas University of London, then Central Saint Martins and Cambridge, can be an elusiveness, a curiously distant affect, reported rather than felt. What really lingers are the vividnesses of his childhood world, the struggles and griefs of his parents, and especially of his mother, to whose life he bears loving witness.
