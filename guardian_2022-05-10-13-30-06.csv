5/10/2022,"Here is everything you need to know about the voting process in the 2022 Australia election. The Australian federal election day is Saturday, 21 May. The Australian Electoral Commission, the independent body that runs elections, says there are 17 million people enrolled to vote in the 2022 federal election – 96.3% of the eligible voting population. The deadline for enrolment was Monday 18 April. If you are not sure of the status of your enrolment, you can check here. You can also call the AEC on 13 23 26. You can find your electorate by entering your address on this page on the AEC website. The results of the 2019 election in each electorate are on the commission’s Tally Room site, but bear in mind that boundaries of some seats in Victoria and Western Australia have changed since then. You can read about what those changes mean on the election blog of the ABC’s Antony Green. If you are unable to cast a ballot in person at a polling station on election day, there are several other ways to vote. At this election extra provision has been made to ensure those affected by the recent floods in Queensland and NSW, and people affected by Covid, are not disenfranchised. If you can’t make it on the day, you can vote in advance at a pre-polling station. A list of these will be published on the AEC website. Mobile polling facilities are also set up in some hospitals, nursing homes, prisons and remote areas in advance of polling day, although at this election that service will be limited by Covid considerations (see below). You can apply via the AEC website to have your ballot papers sent to you in the mail. These must be completed by close of polling on election day and returned to the AEC, which allows 13 days after that for the ballots to arrive. In some countries you may be able to access an overseas voting centre – a list will be posted on the AEC website. Otherwise you need to apply for a postal vote, allowing enough time for the papers to be mailed to you. The AEC has expanded the provision of voting by phone (traditionally used for blind or low-vision Australians) to accommodate people who may be required to isolate because they have Covid or they are a close contact of someone who does. However, it has warned the process may not be entirely flawless. People who expect to be in isolation on polling day may apply for a postal vote. Those who test positive or who are close contacts of someone who tests positive between Wednesday and Saturday should contact the AEC to arrange a vote by phone. Close contacts who return a negative rapid test should check with their state or territory whether they are entitled to leave isolation to vote in person. At the ballot box, you will be handed two pieces of paper. The smaller is for the House of Representatives, which is elected using preferential voting. You must number every box in order of your preference for your vote to be valid. The larger is for the Senate, which consists of 76 members, 12 for each state, and two for each territory. On the Senate ballot paper, you can vote in one of two ways. First, you can number at least six boxes above the line, indicating the parties or groups you prefer in the order of your choice. Or you can vote below the line, meaning you are voting individually for the candidates nominated by each party or group. In this case you must number at least 12 boxes to cast a valid vote. There are 151 members of the House of Representatives, so one party needs to win at least 76 seats to form a majority government. Going into the election, the Liberal-National Coalition holds 76 seats, Labor holds 69 and the six others are held by minor parties and independents. To reach 76, Labor would need to retain their current number of seats and gain another seven. However, picking up an extra four seats from Liberal or Nationals would be enough for them to overtake the Coalition. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It may well be tight. According to analysis by Green: “Labor needs a uniform swing of 3.1% to gain four seats and 3.3% to gain seven. Yet Labor is defending 13 seats on a margin of up to 3%.” If the Coalition loses even one seat, but Labor fails to gain seven, Australia would have a hung parliament. In that case one or other of the major parties would have to secure the support of enough minor party or independent MPs to form government. A new wave of independents is running in Coalition-held seats at this election, which may increase the chances of a hung parliament.",News/Australia news,Australian election 2022 voters’ guide: everything you need to know ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/10/australian-election-2022-voters-guide-how-to-vote-when-who-everything-you-need-to-know-australia-federal-poll-day
5/10/2022,"Belgian cartoonist Pieter De Poortere was trying to do his bit for the environment: eating less meat and diligently sorting his rubbish – glass, paper, plastics. He realised it wasn’t enough. “I thought if we all sort out our trash, then everything will be recycled, everything will be OK, then we are doing great. But actually that is not true,” he said pointing to the problems of the global waste industry, where wealthy countries’ plastic may be dumped, or burned on open fires in poorer countries. So he put his best-known character to work, as part of an international art project that launched in April, aiming to draw attention to the problem of plastic production. Dickie, a pudgy antihero with a bristly moustache, is a perpetual loser, whether in the guise of farmer, astronaut, fairytale hero, or biblical character. “I always try to imagine what is the worst possible thing that could happen to Dickie,” said De Poortere of the character he created nearly two decades ago, who now has a permanent home in the Comics Art Museum in Brussels. Known as Boerke in the original Flemish, the series is drawn in a childlike style, but with a spiky black humour aimed squarely at adults. It has won prizes in Belgium, a country where comic strips are celebrated as high art. After years of mishaps, Dickie is now wreaking havoc on the environment – striking a disastrous deal with “Plastics Inc”, or shooting a kangaroo in a misguided attempt at cutting down on packaging waste. “A lot of my work is very ambiguous,” De Poortere said. “Dickie is sometimes bad, sometimes he is good, sometimes he is a loser, sometimes he is really greedy, he is selfish, he uses people … People start reading it and they are laughing, but often they have to think twice, is this really happening?” Camille Duran, founder of the Swedish-based Cosmic Foundation, the organisation behind the Magnify initiative, the art project featuring De Poortere’s work, said the aim of the project was to shift people’s attention to the production of plastics, not just consumption. “Even if demand is going to start to decrease as policy gets more ambitious, more [petrochemicals] facilities are getting permitted around the world.” Earlier this year, 173 countries pledged to develop a legally binding treaty by 2024 to end plastic pollution. The agreement, which will include measures to tackle plastic production, has been described as the most significant multilateral environmental accord since the Paris climate deal. Yet on current trends, plastic production is expected to double within the next 20 years and by 2050 could account for 15% of the world’s annual carbon budget. Duran, who hopes to expand the project to other parts of the world, began by choosing three artists near some of the world’s biggest petrochemical hotspots: Louisiana, Taiwan and Antwerp. The organisers hope the Dickie pages will help galvanise opposition to a giant plastics plant in Antwerp, planned by the British petrochemical company Ineos. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to Antwerp’s decision to grant Ineos a permit to build a chemicals installation to make ethylene from fracked US shale gas. The campaigners say the project will fuel single use plastics and fails to meet EU climate targets. Ineos counters that the installation will be the greenest of its kind and will aid the production of long-lasting plastics used in technology and healthcare. De Poortere’s sequence on plastics runs throughout May in the Dutch-language weekly Knack. The artist plans to include the pages in a 50-page book covering other environmental emergencies, including global heating, which will be published in 2023. De Poortere, who was born in Ghent, knows Antwerp well, but chose not to locate his work in any particular place, to preserve a universal message. “It is important to get that message through to the public – and not in an annoying way – but through art, through humour, through trying to convince people, just to make them think. I want to show a bit the absurdity of the reality.” Humans, he added, cannot stop doing “stupid things that will be harmful to us. There is tragedy in this shortsightedness, but it is also the basis of a lot of humour.”",News/World news,‘People laugh but think twice’: Belgian cartoonist takes on plastic pollution,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/pieter-de-poortere-dickie-belgian-cartoonist-takes-on-plastic-pollution
5/10/2022,"New Zealand has recorded more than 1m cases of Covid-19, after spending the first 18 months of the pandemic largely free of the virus. The milestone reflects a stark change in New Zealand’s pandemic experience, with more than 986,000 of those cases hitting in the months since the start of 2022. The country has had a huge spike in cases since Omicron breached the borders in December 2021, and the government loosened most restrictions in March. Tuesday’s official 1 million case milestone means at least 20% of the population has now been infected, but modellers said the true number of infections is likely three times higher. “We know that the number of cases that we’re seeing are just a fraction of the true number of infections that are happening,” said Dr Dion O’Neale of Covid Modelling Aotearoa, based at the University of Auckland. O’Neale said modellers’ best estimates were that official case numbers recorded around a third of actual infections – meaning that New Zealand would have now had about 3m infections. Cases were missed for a variety of reasons, he said: some were asymptomatic, some didn’t report positive test results, some didn’t have easy access to testing, and people reluctant to get vaccinated were also reluctant to test or report an infection. Despite the rise in cases, New Zealand’s death rate has remained relatively low by international standards. The total number of publicly reported deaths with Covid-19 is now 876 for the entirety of the pandemic – that figure includes all those who die within 28 days of contracting the virus. Hong Kong, another Covid-elimination state, has recorded more than 9,300 deaths for its population of 7.48m. New Zealand’s low death rate has been assisted by its high levels of vaccination – 95% of adults are double-vaccinated, and 70% have had an additional booster shot. Director-general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said: “I would like to reiterate my thanks to everyone in New Zealand who has played their part to keep our case numbers and rates low when compared internationally, and for continuing to do their bit to follow public health advice and minimise the spread of Covid-19.” O’Neale said that not knowing true infection numbers could present challenges for New Zealand down the line – making it more difficult to predict subsequent waves, reinfection rates, or the burden of long Covid.",News/World news,"New Zealand, once Covid-free, tops 1 million cases since pandemic began",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/new-zealand-once-covid-free-tops-1-million-cases-since-pandemic-began
5/10/2022,"Anthony Albanese has endorsed a minimum wage rise of at least 5.1% to keep up with inflation. The Labor leader made the call at a press conference in Melbourne on Tuesday, after earlier equivocating over a union push for a 5.5% increase in the Fair Work Commission’s annual minimum wage review. The Australian Council of Trade Unions on Monday asked for the $2,200 annual rise, upping their claim from a 5% rise because of surging inflation, which is tipped to hit 5.5% by mid year and 6% by year’s end. Cost-of-living pressures and wage stagnation have emerged as the most important issues for voters ahead of the 21 May election, with runaway inflation already triggering a mid-campaign interest rate rise. On Tuesday Albanese told ABC Radio National he supports people’s wages “not going backwards” but it would be “up to the Fair Work Commission to determine” the unions’ 5.5% claim. Asked if he supported it, Albanese replied: “No … the Fair Work Commission makes its own decisions, but people can’t afford to go backwards.” But Albanese later claimed he had not meant he didn’t support the claim. “The ACTU make their claim independently,” he said. “We’re not the ACTU.” He said Labor would make a separate submission, if elected, that would be based on the minimum wage “at least keeping up with the cost of living”. Asked if he would support a pay rise of 5.1%, the current rate of inflation, Albanese replied: “Absolutely.” The finance minister, Simon Birmingham, told reporters in Brisbane that no political leader had ever put a figure on the size of a pay rise, but Albanese had done so “without a shred of analysis to back his position”. Birmingham said that under Bill Shorten Labor had put in submissions calling for a “fair and economically responsible” pay rise, which Labor had “never been bothered” to do under Albanese. Labor has also committed to make a submission in support of a pay rise in the aged care sector, in which unions are seeking a 25% boost. Labor has promised to criminalise wage theft, ensure minimum conditions including pay in the gig economy and legislate that labour hire workers must receive the same pay as employees of the businesses in which they are placed. On Monday, Scott Morrison criticised Albanese for refusing to guarantee in Sunday’s leaders debate that wages would keep pace with inflation. “There’s no magic wand to increase wages,” the prime minister told reporters in Yerriyong. “There’s no magic pen that makes it all happen. Voting at this election for the Labor Party doesn’t automatically make your wages go up. “The way wages rise is unemployment goes down. That’s how wages rise.” Despite unemployment falling to 4%, many workers are still receiving nominal rises of 2.5% – a pay cut in real terms – because of public sector pay caps and workplace pay deals that locked in lower rates before the inflation surge. In the minimum wage case, which sets the pay of 2.7 million workers, the ACTU is now asking for the hourly rate to rise from $20.33 to $21.45. Morrison on Tuesday said he supports the process of the minimum wage being “independently assessed” by the Fair Work Commission. Labor has targeted the government for making a technical submission that did not endorse a rise of a particular size, and even argued for the “importance of low paid work” as a stepping stone to other jobs. The ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, said “a 5.5% increase is what is now needed just to ensure people tread water, anything less has them drowning in bills”. “Scott Morrison’s government’s submission to the Fair Work Commission is silent on backing a pay increase that keeps up with the cost of living. “Instead it dedicates a whole section to the benefits of low paid work.” In the earlier round of submissions, the Australian Industry Group called for a 2% increase, or $15.45 a week to the minimum wage. The Restaurant and Catering Industry Association called for no increase in the minimum wage, arguing take-home pay is already rising due to job shortages, on top of superannuation increases and budget giveaways.",News/Australia news,Election 2022: Anthony Albanese backs 5.1% minimum wage rise to keep pace with inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/10/election-2022-anthony-albanese-backs-51-minimum-wage-rise-to-keep-pace-with-inflation
5/10/2022,"The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, has left open the prospect of supporting federal Labor’s home equity scheme, saying he is open to “new ways of thinking” on housing affordability. During a press conference with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Tuesday, the NSW premier publicly contradicted the federal Coalition’s opposition to the policy, telling media he believed it was “important that we’re open-minded” about addressing housing. “I’m open to all ideas in relation to how we can drive home ownership. We cannot have an Australia that can’t house its children,” he said. “And we have an obligation, I believe, to look at innovative thinking about helping particularly young people get their keys to their very first home.” Perrottet’s comments were in response to questions about the Labor party’s shared equity housing scheme, under which eligible applicants can get a commonwealth equity contribution of up to 40% of the purchase price of a new home. The $329m scheme, which is modelled on existing policies in the UK and Western Australia, would provide support to about 10,000 homebuyers. But it has been criticised by Morrison, who claimed Labor “wants the government to own your home”, despite him having expressed support for similar schemes in the past. Standing alongside Morrison in the Sydney seat of Bennelong, Perrottet seemed to contradict the prime minister’s critique, saying governments “should be open to all new ideas”. “In our upcoming budget here in our state next month, there’ll be a real focus on housing affordability,” he said. Asked whether he agreed with Morrison, who labelled it a “forced-to-buy” scheme, Perrottet said it was “important that we’re open-minded”. “There will always be different views in relation to housing affordability,” Perrottet said. “From my perspective, that is certainly the approach that we will take in our state. “One thing, when it comes to housing affordability, that states can do is drive supply and open up opportunities and build infrastructure to support it.” Despite Perrottet and Morrison both leading Coalition governments, they have butted heads in the past. As recently as last week Perrottet chided Morrison for going too far in describing the state’s anti-corruption watchdog as a “kangaroo court”. He repeated those criticisms as he stood beside Morrison on Tuesday, saying he accepted they “disagree” on the issue but conceded a response couldn’t be “one size fits all”. “At its heart, what we both agree on is that there should be integrity agencies in place that ensure the best standards in public life,” Perrottet said. “I agree with the prime minister [that] it’s not a one-size-fits-all approach. With our integrity agency, the Icac in NSW, it differs from other integrity agencies in other state jurisdictions. “Ultimately, here in our state, the Icac has played an important role in maintaining high standards in public office and in the public service.” Perrottet, who leads a minority government in NSW, has also played down the federal Coalition’s warnings about the dangers of a hung parliament after the election. Both men were keen to not dwell on their public disagreements, even as they continued to occur during the joint appearance. “Neither of us are pushovers [but] what we always agree on is the importance of the project or the task that we’re actually working on to achieve together,” Morrison said. Perrottet said that while the two “don’t always agree” they have “robust discussions” to “stand up for our people”. Last week Morrison was blasted by the outgoing Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) commissioner, Stephen Rushton, who described critics who had labelled the watchdog a “kangaroo court”, including the prime minister, as “buffoons”. On Tuesday the Australian Bar Association joined the criticism, with the body’s president, Dr Matt Collins AM QC, saying Morrison’s comments were “neither correct nor constructive”. “While there is room for debate about the design, powers and mode of operation of anti-corruption bodies, it is neither correct nor constructive to characterise the NSW Icac as a kangaroo court,” he said. “A kangaroo court is a body that operates with disregard for or perversion of legal procedure. The Icac commissioners are highly experienced and respected jurists who preside over investigations conducted according to law and the powers given to them by the NSW parliament.” Collins also took aim at the prime minister over his dismissal of criticisms of barristers during the press conference. Morrison had said he “didn’t care” if barristers disagreed with him over his comments about the Icac, and that he had “never had much truck” for the profession. “Any person who has no truck with barristers cannot have made a conscientious effort to understand their indispensable contribution to civic society,” Collins said. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, held a press conference with Victorian premier Daniel Andrews in Melbourne on Tuesday to announce billions in funding for the state’s suburban rail loop project. Asked to comment on Morrison’s claim that Albanese would be a “pushover” in funding negotiations with the state, Andrews took aim at Morrison, calling him “desperate”. “That is a ridiculous suggestion that would only be made by a bloke who is so desperate, because he’s been there for a decade and done precisely nothing,” he said. Andrews said Victoria had been “ripped off” by the federal government. “Every federal dollar that Victorians get from the miserable Morrison government [it’s like] we ought to bow our head and treat it like it’s foreign aid,” he said. “We have been ripped off by this Liberal-National government, and instead of Mr Morrison talking about the issue, he ought to have been here delivering for Victorian workers and families. “I’ve had a conversation with the prime minister about suburban rail loop, and zero dollars. Zero dollars.” The Victoria premier said “the contrast could not be clearer” between Morrison and the Albanese. “Anthony Albanese is about building things. He’s about partnership. He’s about creating jobs. He’s about making sure that our cities and regions, our nation, actually works.”",News/Australia news,Dominic Perrottet refuses to join Scott Morrison in condemning Labor’s housing policy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/10/dominic-perrottet-refuses-to-join-scott-morrison-in-condemning-labors-housing-policy
5/10/2022,"Tensions between Shanghai residents and China’s Covid enforcers are on the rise again, amid a new push to end infections outside quarantine zones to meet President Xi Jinping’s demand for achieving “dynamic zero-Covid”. Videos shared on China’s social media platforms showed suspected Covid-positive patients forcibly quarantined in central facilities. In some neighbourhoods a single positive case could lead to residents in the entire apartment building be sent for quarantine. Censors have been taking down many of these videos, but determined residents have continued to post them. Past speeches by top officials and legal scholars have resurfaced in which they speak of the importance of the rule of law. These speeches have been shared and reposted on social media to express disapproval of government policy. Last week, Xi reiterated that his government had no intention of turning away from the controversial zero-Covid commitment, in a major speech to the country’s senior cadres. He urged officials to “unswervingly adhere to the general policy of dynamic zero-Covid” and warned against any criticism or doubting of the policy. Over the weekend, residents in at least four of Shanghai’s 16 districts reported receiving notices that told them they would no longer be able to receive food deliveries or leave their homes, prompting numerous complaints on social media. “The virus itself is no longer scary, but the way the government enforced the policy has become the most frightening thing,” said one Shanghai resident, who wished to remain anonymous. “We had thought the lockdown could be eased this month, but now there’s no end in sight again.” In the past few days, a number of videos shared on social media showed that health officials – also called Dàbái, or “Big Whites” due to their white hazmat suits – entered residents’ homes and sprayed disinfectants everywhere. This practice outraged many residents, who questioned the legality. Others asked whether such a measure had any scientific basis. In one viral video, hazmat-suited enforcement officers ordered residents to be quarantined after a neighbour tested positive. “It’s not that you can do whatever you want – unless you’re in America. This is China,” one of the officers is heard saying. “Stop asking me why, there is no why. We have to adhere to national guidelines.” The Guardian does not know the identities of the residents and whether they were eventually taken away. Not all Shanghai residents were compliant. In a separate video, a local resident addressed government health workers to abide by China’s law. The middle-aged man, clad in a red protective suit with a face mask and a face shield, pointed out that there was always a limit to the power government officials are entitled to, and citizens’ rights should not be abused. “Let me tell you,” the man said, “you can only use your power with the authorisation of law … You have to tell me which items in our country’s law allowed you to carry out your public power today? … Therefore, you cannot enforce hard isolation [upon us].” It is not the first time that the government’s enforcement of zero-Covid has led to tensions in Shanghai, home to 25 million people and a key financial hub in Asia. In April, residents in Pudong – the eastern part of the city – scuffled with hazmat-suited police who were forcing them to surrender their homes to become coronavirus quarantine facilities. Worried about Covid-prevention excesses, legal scholars have voiced their concerns. On Sunday, a long appeal letter urging the government to abide by China’s constitution was widely shared on social media. Censors took down the article multiple times but many determined residents continued to post it. The lead author of the letter, Prof Tong Zhiwei at Shanghai’s East China University of Political Science and Law, said the restrictions and the way the authorities enforced them could lead to “some kind of legal disaster”. “Pandemic prevention needs to be balanced with ensuring people’s rights and freedoms,” Tong wrote. “Local governments and officials need to stick to the constitution and laws, and cannot destroy the rule of law for convenience.” Guobin Yang, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of the book The Wuhan Lockdown, said: “Like what we’ve seen in Wuhan in 2020 when the virus first emerged, citizens are protesting against the government’s blunt enforcement of lockdowns. Shanghai has taken this dynamic to a new level, but we still don’t know how the government will respond in the end.” Shanghai is in its sixth week of lockdown. Case numbers have been decreasing, according to local health officials. On Monday, Shanghai reported 322 locally transmitted Covid cases, 3,625 local asymptomatic infections, and 11 deaths for the previous 24 hours. It was a continued drop in new cases for the 10th straight day. It is not just Shanghai that has been under some form of restrictions. In Beijing, where daily case numbers are far below Shanghai’s at this point in its outbreak, the government has asked residents to work from home. Dozens of bus routes and almost 15% of the Chinese capital’s sprawling subway system have been suspended.",News/World news,‘No end in sight’: Shanghai residents chafe at harsh Covid measures,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/no-end-in-sight-shanghai-residents-chafe-at-harsh-covid-measures
5/10/2022,"Russian forces, backed by tanks and artillery, were conducting “storming operations” on the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, where the southern city’s last defenders remained holed up, Ukraine’s defence ministry said. Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, said Russian forces began “storming” the Azovstal plant after a UN convoy left the Donetsk region. The United States has seen “anecdotal reports” that some Russian troops in Ukraine are not obeying orders, according to a senior US defence official. The US believed Russian troops and “mid-grade officers at various levels, even up to the battalion level” were refusing to move forward in the Donbas offensive. The Pentagon said it had seen indications that Ukrainians caught up in Russia’s invasion were being forcibly removed to Russia. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said he “can’t speak to how many camps or what they look like”. Joe Biden has signed the Ukraine Democracy Defence Lend-Lease Act of 2022 to streamline the supply of US weapons and other material to Ukraine or eastern European countries. US congressional Democrats also agreed to provide another $39.8bn in aid for Ukraine, two sources familiar with the proposal told Reuters on Monday. The European Council president, Charles Michel, made a surprise visit to the Ukrainian port city of Odesa on Monday. Michel was forced to break off a meeting with Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, and take shelter when missiles struck the southern Ukrainian city, according to an EU official. Michel lamented that “silos full” of food for export were blocked in the Black Sea port. In Odesa, Russian missiles struck tourist sites and destroyed five buildings while injuring two people, its city council said. Ukrainian media reported a shopping centre was on fire. The European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, is heading to Hungary to meet its prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to discuss issues related to the proposed sixth package of EU sanctions, which would include a ban on Russian oil imports to the EU. Von der Leyen has said the commission aims to deliver its opinion on EU membership for Ukraine next month. Ukraine has submitted the second part of a formal questionnaire to obtain candidacy for EU membership. “Today we have taken another step – a very important and not just a formal step – on our path to the European Union,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced in his national address late on Monday evening. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said Ukraine’s EU bid would “take several years, indeed, probably several decades”. Speaking to the European parliament in Strasbourg, Macron suggested creating a “parallel European community” for countries aspiring to join the bloc or, in an apparent reference to Britain, countries that had left the union. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, described Macron’s suggestion as “very interesting”. Russia’s ambassador to Poland was pelted with red paint by people protesting against the war in Ukraine as he went to lay flowers at the Soviet military cemetery in Warsaw.

5/10/2022,"Scott Morrison has claimed that “gender reversal surgery for young adolescents” is a “significant issue” – before conceding that gender confirmation is not available to children in Australia. The prime minister made the remarks on Tuesday while responding tothe Liberal candidate Katherine Deves walking back her apology for offensive comments about transgender children. She insisted that “mutilation” was the correct terminology for gender reassignment surgery. The Liberal candidate for Warringah, who has spent much of the campaign dodging the media, made the comments to Sky News on Monday – reframing her apology as limited to how people “might have perceived” her earlier anti-trans advocacy. On Tuesday Morrison continued to stand by Deves, despite saying he “wouldn’t use” the term “mutilation”. He told reporters in Sydney that “gender reversal surgery for young adolescents” was a “significant issue” that parents were “very concerned” about, appearing to conflate surgery with other treatments for gender dysphoria. He was then forced to concede under questioning that people aged under 18 cannot undertake gender confirmation surgery in Australia. Deves came under scrutiny in the early phase of the federal election campaign for social media comments describing trans children as “surgically mutilated and sterilised” and likening anti-trans activism to standing up against the Holocaust. She then said in a statement that her “language has on occasion been unacceptable”. “It has hurt people and detracted from my arguments,” she said. “I apologise for such language and the hurt that I have caused. I commit to continuing the fight for the safety of girls and women in a respectful way.” Asked on Monday about use of the term “mutilation” to describe surgery on teenagers, Deves replied: “Look, that is actually the correct medico-legal term. “It’s very emotive, it’s very confronting and it’s very ugly so of course people are going to be offended. But when you look at medical negligence cases, that is the terminology they use – it is also contained in the Crimes Act of NSW.” The Crimes Act contains an offence of female genital mutilation but states that sexual reassignment performed by a medical practitioner is not an offence. Asked to clarify if this meant she was not apologising for use of that language, Deves explained: “I’m apologising for how people might have perceived it, and the fact that it is confronting, and it is ugly, and I certainly don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings. But that is the correct terminology.” LGBTQ advocates were quick to point out Deves’ contributions were offensive not just in the terms they’re expressed, but for factual inaccuracies about the availability of gender reassignment surgery: Children are not getting “gender reassignment surgery”.“Gender reassignment surgery” is not performed on or available to teenagers under 18 in Aus.This is completely ridiculous https://t.co/8frBLcfc5L On Tuesday Morrison said the issues Deves had commented on were “incredibly sensitive [and] very challenging”. “We can’t pretend that this type of surgery is some minor procedure,” he said. “This is a very significant change to a young person’s life and it is often irreversible.” According to the government’s HealthDirect website, gender confirmation surgery is only available for adults who have had gender dysphoria “for some time” – while others may be “comfortable to live with gender dysphoria or to have hormone therapy only”. Asked why he and Deves had referred to adolescents when the surgery was not available to them, Morrison replied: “Even at any other stage, this is serious change”. He added: “The process of discussions about gender reassignment – the surgical procedure can’t [occur in adolescence], but the process … by which these discussions commence and when issues of gender are being discussed with adolescents – that’s when a process can commence.” Minutes after incorrectly asserting that “gender reversal surgery” was available to adolescents, Morrison claimed the government dealt with the issue “sensitively”. In April Deves told SBS news she had been “chastened” by the reaction to her tweets but she also appeared to blame the social media platform for her own inflammatory comments. “I recognise that trying to prosecute arguments on complex, difficult and nuanced subjects should not take place on a platform that propagates offence and division and hurt,” she said. “And going forward, I will be conducting myself within a dignified and respectful fashion.” Morrison, who handpicked Deves to run just weeks out from the start of the campaign, has repeatedly defended the Warringah candidate by noting she had apologised for her remarks. On Saturday he said: “In terms of what Katherine Deves has said in the past, she has withdrawn those and she said they were insensitive. “And that was my view as well. So there’s no suggestion that I have supported those earlier comments. I don’t support those earlier comments.” On Tuesday Anthony Albanese said Deves’ “mutilation” comment was not appropriate. “Vulnerable people, in particular, are deserving of respect,” the Labor leader told reporters in Sydney. “Every human being deserves respect. What we need to look for from our national political leaders is ways to unify the country and bring people together, not play politics in order to divide people.” Earlier, the shadow infrastructure minister, Catherine King, told ABC News Breakfast it did not surprise her that Deves had walked back the apology. “I think this is an incredibly divisive debate and I think the prime minister has chosen a very divisive candidate to run in that seat and I think it’s really awful to see that happening in the context of a federal election campaign,” she said.",News/Australia news,Morrison stands by Katherine Deves and wrongly claims ‘young adolescents’ can have gender confirmation surgery,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/10/katherine-deves-backtracks-on-apology-for-comments-about-transgender-children
5/10/2022,"The Queensland government says it will fully implement all 89 recommendations of a landmark women’s safety taskforce, including introducing new laws to criminalise coercive control and holding a four-month inquiry into “widespread cultural issues” within the state’s police service. The government says it will spend $363m on a package of reforms recommended by the taskforce, led by the former court of appeal president Margaret McMurdo. They include the expansion of domestic violence courts and funding more successful co-responder programs, which involve police working alongside domestic violence support services. Criminalising coercive control has been on the state’s agenda since the murder of Hannah Clarke and her three children in 2020. The process will take at least three years, and will be subject to a maximum prison term of 14 years. Clarke’s parents, Sue and Lloyd, told reporters on Tuesday the reforms would give their family a voice. “We’re so grateful that they’re actually going to make coercive control law, it’s something we’ve been pushing for,” Lloyd Clarke said. The taskforce described coercive control as “a pattern of ongoing and escalating behaviours” that destroy a woman’s self-agency, her sense of safety and her ability to seek help. But the idea of creating a new criminal offence has been divisive among women’s advocates, including Indigenous women, who say it risks causing additional harm to vulnerable women given longstanding and documented problems with police responses. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Guardian Australia has reported extensively on policing failures related to domestic violence victims in Queensland, including concerns that police had regularly misidentified victims and perpetrators in cases where women face lethal risks.These issues are particularly acute for Indigenous and minority women. Last year, prisoner advocacy group Sisters Inside and the Institute for Collaborative Race Research said criminalising coercive control would “further deter at-risk women from engaging with police in domestic violence situations and will subject them to the very forms of subtle control that this legislation ostensibly seeks to avoid.” The McMurdo taskforce ultimately designed a path to criminalisation of coercive control that first involved a commission of inquiry to examine cultural issues with the police, and investigate the need for an independent law enforcement conduct commission. Women’s groups have said the inquiry is a critical step. The Queensland police service and the police union had both opposed the inquiry. Coercive control is not yet illegal in any Australian state. The UK criminalised coercive controlling behaviours in 2015. A review of the English law, published in March, found that since the offence was introduced, the number of coercive control offences recorded had increased each year, but charges were increasingly rare. In 2018-19, police in England and Wales only charged 6% of recorded offences. The conviction rate of those charged was 52%. Most of those prosecutions were for instances where the offender was also charged with other offences, such as assault. The review noted “evidential difficulties” caused challenges for police and prosecutors. A recent article in the UK Law Society gazette said the impact of criminalisation had been limited because of “a lack of understanding of the offence by the police, coupled with practical difficulties in proving it”. In announcing that the government would adopt all 89 of McMurdo’s recommendations, the attorney general, Shannon Fentiman, said the inquiry would run for four months and hear testimony from women about their treatment. The government will announced detailed terms of reference, and the appointment of a commissioner, on Wednesday. Fentiman also said Queensland would trial a collaborative co-response model involving police and specialist domestic and family violence services working together in a number of locations. “A key focus of the reforms will be to build understanding of DFV and coercive control across the agency to help police improve how they respond to these matters,” Fentiman said. “Officers need to be able to better identify DFV as a pattern of behaviour over time and assess risk for coercive control and non-physical forms of violence. “We will act to develop specialist expertise and training in DFV, and improve the frontline response to incidents through development of a manual to guide officers.” A recent trial of a co-responder program in Toowoomba, where a domestic violence support worker was embedded at the police station, was found to have been a success. Kathleen Turley from the Domestic Violence Action Centre, which helped run the pilot program, said it had increased safety for women seeking protection. “We’ve had some really fantastic outcomes of being able to support someone at the station to assist in deescalating their anxiety,” Turley said. “Being able to support someone to be able to really unpack their story and be able to provide a full history of what’s been happening can sometimes make a difference between police getting a bigger picture of what’s been happening in the relationship. “They’re scared and they’re frightened and they won’t necessarily be articulating the same way they would when they’re not fearful and scared.” The successful pilot program’s funding had been due to run out in June. The government’s package includes measures to better support women, a strategy for First Nations communities, funding for perpetrator programs to change men’s behaviour, the expansion of police high-risk teams, and a community education campaign. “Our systems need to respond better to this unique form of violence and we need to shift our focus from responding to single incidents of violence to the pattern of abusive behaviour that occurs over time,” Fentiman said. The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the inquiry had heard from more than 700 women with lived experience of domestic and family violence. “My government has heard. My government has listened. My government is acting,” Palaszczuk said.",News/Australia news,Queensland to criminalise coercive control and probe police response to domestic violence,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/10/queensland-to-criminalise-coercive-control-and-probe-police-response-to-domestic-violence
5/10/2022,"A man has been pulled from flood waters and calls for help are rising in Queensland’s north as authorities warn record May rainfall may lead to “dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding” in the region. A flood watch was in place on Tuesday for much of tropical and inland Queensland. The state’s fire and emergency services assistant commissioner, Andrew Short, said crews had responded to 39 calls for help in the 24 hours to Tuesday morning, with the most intense downpours to shift east on Wednesday. “We believe that because of … what’s playing out in front of us, we’re going to see those numbers go up,” he told ABC radio. Short urged people against driving into flood waters after the rescue of a man in his 20s who became trapped in Mount Isa around 11pm on Monday. “Think about your family, think about those around you, think about the rescuers who actually are going to have to come and help you in that event,” he said. A severe weather warning was issued from Cairns to Cloncurry, and from Croydon in the north and south to Carnarvon, as an unseasonably moist north-easterly combined with an upper trough, producing a rain band over central Queensland. Flash flooding was likely, with six-hour rainfall totals of up to 100mm forecast from Wednesday and falls of up to 150mm possible in central-west and north-west districts. “Locally intense rainfall with embedded thunderstorms which may lead to dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding is also possible for the central west and parts of the north west districts,” the Bureau of Meteorology said in an alert. “Some locations including Townsville, the Central West, Herbert/Burdekin and the Sunshine Coast may receive their highest May rainfall on record this week.” Ben Domensino, a Weatherzone meteorologist, said parts of central-western Queensland could get five times the monthly average of rainfall in a matter of days. “It’s very unusual to have a rainfall event of this magnitude in Queensland in May,” Domensino said. “May is typically the time of year you’ve moved out of the wet season. “Longreach averages 23mm of rain during an entire month – there’s potential to see more than 200mm over the next 24 to 48 hours.” Severe Weather Warning issued for the Central West and North West, including #Longreach, #Winton and #Richmond.

Longreach, Clermont, Winton, Charters Towers, Townsville, Georgetown, Hughenden, Richmond, Julia Creek, Collinsville, Ingham and Innisfail were forecast to be hardest hit by the storms. A severe weather warning was also in place for the gulf country, northern goldfields and upper Flinders regions. Six-hourly falls between 60mm and 100mm were likely.

About 31 catchments in northern, western and eastern Queensland north of Bowen were on flood watch, with some still experiencing flooding from recent weather events. Domensino said the prolonged period of rain would last until Friday or Saturday, with some unpredictability towards the end of the event depending on where the upper level trough moved. “Tuesday it’s inland, Wednesday it’s moving towards the coast and Thursday and Friday [is] a bit harder to predict,” he said. “Some models have it over the central coast and some down near the south-east coast by Friday. Some models are predicting the heaviest rain to be up over the central coast or down near south-east Queensland including Brisbane. “The weather warning is likely to extend farther east towards central coast or north tropical coast on Wednesday … that means there’ll be rain right up and down the coast from Cape York to the south-east.” The landscape in south-east Queensland is still saturated, which would make it more prone to flooding in the event of heavy rain, Domensino said. “Soil moisture is above average for most of Queensland at the moment,” he said. “And in the west of state it’s very flat … You’d expect on Wednesday that much rain falling over flat areas would likely cut off roads and cause quite a lot of flash flooding and riverine flooding.” River levels were easing in the Thomson, Barcoo and Cooper catchments but renewed level rises were possible from Tuesday onwards as further heavy rainfall hit the region. The Cooper Creek’s main channel was sitting at 5.26 metres and falling on Monday afternoon, but was expected to remain above the major flood level of five metres into Tuesday. River rises were expected to remain above the Diamantina Lakes causeway with heavy rainfall forecast for the upper Diamantina and Western River catchments throughout the week.

A moderate flood warning was also in place for Eyre Creek, with minor flooding possible at the Georgina River south of Mount Isa. The BoM said there was still uncertainty about where the heaviest falls would be later in the week, with warnings to “continue to be refined” in coming days.

5/10/2022,"It was in 1986 that the dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his family were forced to leave the Philippines in disgrace. Helicopters airlifted the family from the Malacañang Palace, as protesters filled the streets. Marcos Sr, after ruling with an iron fist for 20 years, had been toppled by a popular uprising, the People Power Revolution. Crowds stormed the abandoned palace, discovering the extent of the family’s opulence. There were grand artworks, boxes of commemorative gold coins, lavish jewellery, hundreds of gowns, dresses, and, infamously, an enormous collection of designer shoes belonging to the former first lady, Imelda Marcos. Analysts say that, ever since the family was ousted, it has been intent on forging a comeback. In the documentary The Kingmaker, Imelda Marcos described it as her son’s destiny to become the president. Now he is on the cusp of doing so. Ferdinand Marcos Jr, “known as Bongbong”, was educated in the Philippines and at a boarding school in England. An extract from Marcos Sr’s diary suggests the family was concerned his son lacked the “character” needed for the future. “Bongbong is our principal worry. He is too carefree and lazy,” he writes, adding later: “I have told him that since we have enemies, he will have to fight the battles I fought in the past against myself and against circumstance.” Marcos Jr began studying politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford, but, according to the university, did not complete a degree course and was awarded a special diploma in social sciences. Marcos insists he graduated with the equivalent of a degree. After university, Marcos Jr became the vice-governor of his home province, Ilocos Norte, on the north-western tip of Luzon, at the age of 23 and later governor. He was 29 when his father was ousted and the family was forced to leave the Philippines. Marcos Sr died in exile in 1989. However, the family was allowed to return to the country in the 1990s. Marcos Jr then began to re-establish his political career, again becoming governor in Ilocos Norte, the family’s stronghold, a congressman and a senator. In 2016, he ran for vice-president but lost to Leni Robredo – an outcome he unsuccessfully challenged in court. Robredo lost to him in the 2022 presidential race. Marcos is married to the lawyer Louise Araneta-Marcos, known as Liza, with whom he has three sons. The eldest, Ferdinand Alexander Marcos III, known as Sandro, is running for the first district congressional seat of Ilocos Norte, and has developed a prominent social media presence where he is received adoringly by young female supporters. The family continues to face numerous court cases over their plundered wealth, which is estimated to be as high as $10bn. Imelda is appealing against a 2018 criminal conviction on seven corruption charges. Marcos Jr has been unapologetic about his family’s past and has downplayed or denied abuses under his father’s rule. He praised his father as a “political genius”, and his mother as the dynasty’s “supreme politician” during a recent interview with CNN Philippines. Under martial law, which was imposed by Marcos in 1972, thousands of Marcos critics were arrested, tortured and killed. Marcos Jr’s camp, and its supporters, have portrayed the Marcos years as a time when the country was thriving and prosperous. Online misinformation about the era has inundated social media, prompting media groups and academics to form factchecking initiatives. Marcos Jr’s appeal has relied on nostalgia relating to his father’s rule, say analysts. “He did not inherit the political savvy or the appeal or the charm of the father,” said Prof Maria Ela L Atienza, who teaches political science at the University of the Philippines. “He’s basically living off or campaigning on the basis of the name of the father.” His campaign, which carried the slogan “together we shall rise again”, promised unity and a return to what he has portrayed to be a former greatness. He has also pledged to prioritise jobs and lower the cost of living, including bringing down the cost of rice, though critics say such proposals are lacking in detail. His opponents fear the return of the family to power could lead to the reversal of democratic gains made in the country since his father was toppled in 1986.",News/World news,Marcos Jr aims to fulfil family’s ‘destiny’ as Philippines president,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/ferdanand-marcos-jr-bonbong-philippines-president-promises-unity
5/10/2022,"The unrelenting slaughter of Mexican journalists has continued after two more newspeople were gunned down by unidentified assassins – taking the 2022 death toll to 11 in what is the deadliest country for media professionals outside a warzone. Yesenia Mollinedo Falconi and Sheila Johana García Olivera were murdered in the town of Cosoleacaque, about 350 miles east of the capital Mexico City, around 3pm on Monday. According to reports, Mollinedo, the director of a weekly publication called El Veraz, and García, a reporter, were shot inside their Ford Ikon outside a roadside convenience store. “They have despicably and cowardly murdered a fellow reporter,” one local journalist announced in a video dispatch from the crime scene, as rifle-toting security forces surrounded the area. Mollinedo and García are only the latest in a succession of Mexican reporters to lose their lives this year in what is a growing scandal that the president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has been accused of failing to adequately address. In fact, many critics believe López Obrador, a media-bashing populist known as Amlo, is fuelling the violence with his incessant public attacks on journalists who he has labelled ill-intentioned conservative “mercenaries” bent on undermining his nationalist administration. Attacks on the press have surged 85% in the three years since Amlo took power in December 2018 with every single Mexican state witnessing such incidents for the first time in 2021. Seven journalists were killed in the whole of last year, compared to 11 in the first five months of 2022. “Every day [Amlo] urges society to discredit the journalistic profession – and clearly we are paying the price in blood,” said Sonia de Anda, a Tijuana-based journalist who recently confronted Mexico’s president over the killings. Tijuana, which sits on the US border near San Diego, has suffered most this year, with two prominent journalists murdered outside their homes there since January: the photojournalist Margarito Martínez Esquivel and the television reporter Lourdes Maldonado. The government has blamed both killings on people linked to the Arellano-Félix crime cartel – but many are skeptical. “Tijuana’s got a pretty long history of grabbing someone who may have had the gun in their hand, but not touching the person who was actually responsible,” Michael Lettieri, a San Diego-based researcher and human rights activist told the San Diego Union-Tribune this week. Speaking earlier this year, Adela Navarro Bello, the director of the Tijuana weekly Zeta, said: “Right now the Mexican press is caught in the crossfire between the threats and bullets of narco-traffickers and organized crime and the threats and verbal attacks and attempts to morally annihilate us from the federal and state governments.” “When a journalist is murdered, it’s not just the family that loses their loved one … society loses too,” added Navarro Bello, whose publication has not put a reporter’s name on an investigative story since 2006 for fear of them being shot dead. “When a journalist is murdered society becomes a little bit blinder and a little bit more deaf.” The attorney general’s office in Veracruz state, where Cosoleacaque is located, insisted Monday’s murders would not go unpunished. “All lines of inquiry will be pursued, including any connection to their journalistic activities,” it said on Twitter. However, campaigners say there is impunity in 90% of such crimes and see little sign of change. Griselda Triana, a journalist whose crime reporter husband, Javier Valdez Cárdenas, was assassinated five years ago, was among dozens of demonstrators who hit the streets of Mexico City on Monday afternoon to protest the tsunami of murders. “It is so easy for them to kill a journalist,” Triana lamented, remembering how her family had been shattered by his notorious 2017 shooting in Culiacán state. “Sometimes they threaten them, sometimes the victim gets no warning at all and they just get rid of them. Justice either takes too long, or never comes at all.” “It’s a feeling of such helplessness,” said Pablo Pérez, a Mexican producer for Al Jazeera who was also at the demonstration. “Eleven [murders] is heartbreaking and the naturalness of knowing that before long there will be another killing is absurd.” Jordi Lebrija, a Tijuana journalist who was friends with Margarito Martínez, noted how nearly all of the journalists murdered this year were, like him, killed outside their homes. “It’s a message. Not even outside your house are you safe,” Lebrija said as he stood at the spot where Martínez had died. “We are looking at you. We know who you are. We know what you do. That’s the message for journalists.”",News/World news,Two slain in Mexico are the latest in unrelenting slaughter of journalists,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/mexico-journalists-killed-slaughter-amlo
5/10/2022,"Countries should move from coal to renewable energy without shifting to gas as a “transition” fuel to save money, as high gas prices and market volatility have made the fossil fuel an expensive option, analysis has found. Natural gas has long been touted as a “transition” fuel for economies dependent on coal for their power needs, as it has lower carbon dioxide emissions than coal but requires similar centralised infrastructure, and gas-fired power stations take only a couple of years to build. Earlier this year, before Russia invaded Ukraine, the European Commission angered green campaigners by including gas as a “bridge” to clean energy in its guidebook for green investment. High prices for gas, and the plummeting cost of renewable energies such as wind and solar power, have reversed that logic, according to analysis from TransitionZero. The cost of switching from coal to renewable energy has plunged by 99% since 2010, according to its report published on Tuesday. The findings call into question the economic viability of the scores of gas and coal-fired power plants that are planned or under construction around the world. About 615GW of new gas plants, and 442GW of new coal-fired power stations, are planned for construction globally, according to the analysis. Matt Gray, the co-founder of TransitionZero, said it no longer made sense to think of gas as a transition fuel, and countries should opt for renewables in place of coal. “Despite some regional variation, our analysis shows a clear deflationary trend in the cost of switching from coal to clean electricity,” he said. “Independent of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, this trend will accelerate, presenting governments with an economic opportunity to protect electricity consumers from continued fossil fuel volatility.” Many countries are reviewing their energy policies in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – which has sent fossil fuel prices soaring and disrupted supplies – and may be considering a reversion to coal. The amount of power generated from coal rose 9% to a record high last year, even before the war in Ukraine, and if the coal-fired power stations now planned are built the world will have little chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C, according to separate analysis published last month. Gray said that although the economics were firmly in favour of renewable energy, governments must make some policy changes in order to realise the full benefits. These included making it easier to build windfarms and solar power, because acquiring planning permission can take up to 10 years in some regions; removing distorting incentives and tax breaks for fossil fuels; and ensuring electricity markets are properly functioning. The analysis also found that the economics of moving from coal power to renewable energy, without using gas, were most favourable in Europe, where the price of coal has increased, in part because of EU policies and also because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In China and the US, however, domestically produced coal is cheaper than in Europe. Despite the lower price of renewables, China is still planning new coal-fired power stations, and the US could increase its coal use in response to higher demand for gas. In Japan, the price of switching from coal to renewables is higher still, because of “discriminatory regulations and land-use constraints”, and in south-east Asia some countries subsidise coal and gas, distorting the economics of a switch to clean power.",News/Environment,"Avoid using gas as ‘transition’ fuel in move to clean energy, study urges",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/10/avoid-using-gas-transition-fuel-move-clean-energy-study-urges
5/10/2022,"Drivers are scrambling to buy secondhand electric cars, more than doubling sales in the past year as demand for zero-emission vehicles surges. Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) show that the number of transactions for electric cars increased from 6,600 in the first three months of 2021 to almost 14,600 in the first quarter of this year, an increase of 120%. The secondhand car industry has been buoyed over much of the past two years – despite intermittent freezes in many markets during lockdowns – as the coronavirus pandemic and semiconductor computer chip shortages have delayed the delivery of new cars, pushing buyers to opt for more readily available used cars instead. Many lightly used secondhand cars have changed hands for more than their new equivalents. The supply of used electric cars is still relatively meagre, however, and is likely to remain so for several years until first owners and commercial buyers such as rental fleets sell on their first-generation vehicles. The SMMT’s chief executive, Mike Hawes, said: “Electric car sales are energising the market, with zero-emission vehicles starting to filter through in larger numbers to consumers looking forward to driving the latest and greenest vehicles. “Although there is some way to go before we see the recent growth in new EVs replicated in the used market, a buoyant new car market will be vital to help drive fleet renewal, which is essential to the delivery of carbon savings.” Overall sales of secondhand cars rose by 5.1% year on year to 1.7 million, the SMMT said in data published on Tuesday, although they were still 12% below figures from 2019, before the pandemic. Separate data from the used-car website Auto Trader shows that average prices for all used cars on its platform rose from £13,900 in April 2020 to £17,400 in April 2022. Prices for mass-market secondhand electric vehicles rose from £18,500 to £25,800 over that period. Demand for electric cars is rising particularly fast in the UK as buyers prepare for anticipated bans or increased levies on fossil-fuel cars in several cities. The capital’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, plans to extend the city’s ultra-low emission zone to the whole of Greater London by the end of next year, and Manchester’s clean-air zone will belatedly be launched this summer.

5/10/2022,"The UK’s soaring cost of living and last month’s record increase in household energy bills have slammed the brakes on consumer spending, retail sector figures show. However, according to separate data, April was the strongest month for international travel spending since before the pandemic, as Britons took advantage of the easing of Covid restrictions to book foreign holidays. Figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) show total retail sales across the UK fell by 0.3% in April as consumers tightened their belts. Spending on big-ticket items including electrical goods, furniture and homewares was particularly hard hit. Reflecting the overall slump in spending, the drop in total sales over the four weeks to 30 April compared with a three-month average growth rate of 3.2% and a 12-month rate of 6.4%. But separate data from Barclaycard showed improvements in spending on travel and international holiday bookings. The credit provider, which processes nearly half of all card transactions, said consumer spending grew 18.1% in April as airlines and travel agents had the best month since the onset of the pandemic two years ago. Spending on hotels, resorts and accommodation rose 16.6% compared with the same month in 2019, the category’s highest growth since September last year, reflecting the scramble for weekend breaks at Easter and a rush for summer holiday bookings. But Barclaycard said spending on essentials grew by marginally less than in March owing to a slight reduction in petrol usage, in a sign that Britons are seeking to save money on fuel and groceries. Highlighting the hit from higher energy bills in April, average spending on utilities per customer grew 28.8%, while Barclaycard said as many as nine in 10 people were concerned about the impact of rising household bills on their finances. According to the BRC, food sales fell 1.3% over the three months to April, compared with a 12-month average growth rate of 0.7%. While sales of clothes and footwear continued to rise, consumers curbed non-essential spending, with technology and items for the home bearing the brunt of spending cuts. The BRC said April sunshine helped to boost sales of fashion and garden goods, including outfits for special occasions such as weddings. The Bank of England has warned of mounting danger of a recession, with inflation on course to peak above 10% later this year, and Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said households were facing a difficult year ahead. “The rising cost of living has crushed consumer confidence and put the brakes on consumer spending,” she said. “Further headwinds are incoming, such as rising global food prices, which rose 13% between March and April.

5/10/2022,"Joe Wicks has said he realised the scale of the UK’s mental health crisis when he was inundated with messages from fans during lockdown, saying he would sometimes spend seven hours a day responding to pleas for help. The 36-year-old fitness coach, known as the Body Coach, will explore his parents’ mental health issues in a new documentary, looking at how his mother’s eating disorder and severe obsessive compulsive disorder and his father’s drug addiction affected him as a child. Joe Wicks: Facing My Childhood, was produced by documentary-maker Louis Theroux, who previously revealed Wicks’s exercise programme was one of the things that helped him cope during lockdown. Wicks told the Radio Times: “After [YouTube series] PE with Joe ended, I realised I hadn’t just helped people’s physical health, but their mental health, too. I wanted to keep that conversation going. “As a young kid, I didn’t realise my parents had mental health issues. I just thought my dad was a drug addict and my mum loved cleaning. But I was aware I had this ability to share my story, and that hopefully it would inspire people.” The fitness and nutrition specialist revealed that as a child he used exercise to de-stress and avoid the atmosphere at home. He said: “If I hadn’t exercised, I would have been a nightmare. No one would have been able to control me. PE was the one subject I looked forward to because it helped me focus.” Wicks revealed he has received little therapy himself, except a few family counselling sessions as a child, and that the documentary is the deepest he has gone into his past. Learning from his experience of being kept in the dark, Wicks hoped children could be kept more informed about their parents’ mental health. He said: “Millions of parents are experiencing mental health issues, particularly after lockdown. They’re bottling it up and trying to be brave and happy, but inside they’re probably crumbling. When the parents pull away, the children become withdrawn.” Wicks said he discovered the depth of the nation’s mental health problems after being deluged by messages from fans during lockdown. He would sometimes spend up to seven hours a day replying to the thousands of messages and pleas for help he received. “Helping people is addictive. When I open my phone and go on Instagram, I’m not just going to see a cat video. I’m going to see a DM [direct message] from someone who’s in need. That feeling of helping someone is energising, but it also drains me. It’s overwhelming to take it all on.” The documentary will air on BBC One on 16 May.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Joe Wicks says millions of parents suffering mental health issues after lockdown,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/10/joe-wicks-says-millions-of-parents-suffering-mental-health-issues-after-lockdown
5/10/2022,"Priti Patel has admitted that it will take time to establish the government’s high-profile plan to send people who arrive in the UK without authorisation to Rwanda, amid growing suspicion that it will not solve the migration crisis in the Channel. In a further attack on the legal profession, the home secretary blamed “specialist lawyers” as the main reason for the delays in setting up the scheme. Under a partnership agreement, people arriving in the UK via unauthorised routes, including by crossing the Channel in small boats, will face the possibility of being flown 4,000 miles to Rwanda. Boris Johnson has said that the scheme will be up and running by the end of this month. The Home Office confirmed on Monday night that the first group of people would be informed this week of the government’s intention to relocate them to Rwanda. The first flights are expected to take place in the coming months, it said, adding that lawyers for some of those affected were likely to launch proceedings to stop their removal. Speaking during a visit to the Metropolitan police specialist training centre in Kent earlier on Monday, Patel said there were “barriers and hurdles” to overcome in implementing the scheme. Asked if it would be a long time before removals take place and whether she was confident the scheme would work, she said: “When it comes to our migration and economic development partnership with Rwanda, it is clear that our objective as a government is to remove those with no legal basis of being in the UK, to Rwanda. “I’ve said from day one, even when I signed the agreement and announced the partnership, that this will take time and it will take time for a range of reasons. “We see various hurdles and barriers, mainly from specialist law firms that want to block the removal of individuals that have no right to be in our country. That is part of the techniques that they use. “We see this day in, day out. I see this with all the removals, whether it’s foreign national offenders, people that have caused harm and criminal offences against British citizens – these firms specialise in preventing their removal. “So yes, there will be barriers and yes, it will be hurdles, but … it is a determination of this government, through the work that I have led, including the Nationality and Borders Act … that act of parliament will give us greater powers and greater means through the changes in legislation to remove those individuals who have no legal right to be in our country.” Her defence comes after the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, claimed that the £120m deal signed with Rwanda amounted to little more than a “press release” after it was disclosed that the government will have to pay for accommodation, flights and living costs for everyone sent to Rwanda. Fewer than 200 people who came to the UK without authorisation would have been sent to Rwanda last year, according to a Refugee Council analysis. Last week the prime minister was criticised for “attacks” on lawyers who are “simply doing their jobs” while the government faces legal action over the plans. Johnson claimed “liberal lawyers” would attempt to scupper the deal as Downing Street said flights for the one-way trip to the east African nation may not take place for months, in light of criticism and legal challenges. Mark Fenhalls QC, chairman of the Bar Council, said: “Attacks on men and women for simply doing their jobs are irresponsible and undermine the rule of law.” Sir Jonathan Jones QC, a former head of the government’s legal department and now a senior consultant at the law firm Linklaters, said it was “not fair to blame the lawyers for bringing such challenges – they are just serving the best interests of their clients, as they are professionally bound to do”.",News/Politics,Priti Patel blames lawyers as she admits Rwanda plan will ‘take time’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/10/priti-patel-blames-specialist-lawyers-rwanda-plan-delays
5/10/2022,"Council-maintained schools in England outperform academies in Ofsted rankings, according to analysis published on the day the government’s ambitions for all schools to join multi-academy trusts (Mats) are expected to be outlined in the Queen’s speech. Research conducted on behalf of the Local Government Association (LGA) found 92% of council-run schools were ranked outstanding or good by Ofsted in January 2022, compared with 85% of academies that have been graded since they converted. It also found only 45% of academies that were already an academy in August 2018 managed to improve standards from inadequate or requires improvement to good or outstanding, compared with 56% of council-maintained schools. The findings are part of an ongoing dispute over the impact of taking schools out of local authority control and putting them into Mats, but will have added piquancy ahead of Tuesday’s Queen’s speech, in which the schools bill will be a centrepiece legislation. The government has previously said it wants all schools in England to join or be in the process of joining a strong Mat by 2030, but many in the sector – including the National Education Union – have questioned the evidence for such a move. Currently 80% of secondary schools and 40% of primaries are academies. According to LGA research, which looked at Ofsted ratings between August 2018 and January 2022, 81% of council-maintained schools retained their outstanding rating, compared with 72% of outstanding academies that did not inherit grades from their former maintained school status. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, said: “Our new schools bill, alongside the schools white paper, will create a school system that works for every child, parent and family, bringing every school up to our current best standards. We want every school to be part of an academy trust, enabling teachers to focus on what they do best – meeting the needs of every child.” The bill will also strengthen the regulatory framework for academy trusts, with powers to intervene where they are failing. It will place a duty on local authorities to provide support to home schooling families, establish compulsory registers for children not in school and give Ofsted more powers to crack down on unregistered schools operating illegally. The government’s schools white paper, published in March, attempted to sweeten the pill for councils, indicating they would for the first time be able to set up their own Mats. The LGA urged the government “to build on this and utilise the knowledge and expertise of councils in supporting schools to improve”. Anntoinette Bramble, a councillor and chair of the LGA’s children and young people board, said: “While academisation can be a positive choice in some cases, these findings raise questions over whether a one-size-fits-all approach is a guaranteed way of improving results and strengthening a school’s performance.” Kevin Courtney, a joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “Today’s research once again brings into question the government’s drive to force all schools to join a multi-academy trust. The government should concentrate on the real challenges schools face – recovery from the pandemic, inadequate funding, rising class sizes, and a teacher recruitment and retention crisis – but they have no answers for them.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The evidence quoted by the Local Government Association fails to take into account many schools will join trusts to address historic underperformance, which can take a number of years, or more than one cycle of Ofsted inspections. “Our data from over the past decade shows strong academy trusts can transform underperforming schools. More than seven out of 10 schools which became academies due to underperformance in inspections while they were local authority maintained schools now have a good or outstanding Ofsted rating. “That is why we are opening new routes for schools to join a strong academy trust, including by working with local authorities to allow them to establish trusts for the first time.”",News/Education,"Council-run schools outperform academies in England, analysis shows",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/10/council-run-schools-outperform-academies-england-analysis-shows
5/10/2022,"A baby died after maternity staff repeatedly missed chances to intervene to save his life, an official investigation has found. Giles Cooper-Hall was just 16 hours old when he died after a catalogue of errors in the maternity care of his mother, Ruth Cooper-Hall, at Derriford hospital in Plymouth. A Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) report into the incident, published on Tuesday, has exposed how inexperienced and overstretched staff failed to carry out proper checks, recognise there was an emergency or seek help from senior doctors until it was too late. It comes just weeks after the independent Ockenden report into more than 1,800 cases revealed serious failings in the maternity care provided at Shrewsbury and Telford hospital NHS Trust. HSIB’s new report highlighted how similar issues at University hospitals Plymouth NHS trust meant staff missed multiple opportunities to save Giles. It revealed how Ruth Cooper-Hall, then aged 37, was not personally seen by a consultant when she went into labour in October last year, despite recommendations made in the interim Ockenden report published in December 2020. The HSIB report also suggested Giles’ death could have been avoided if staff had known about the care plan for his mother’s labour. Instead, vital messages were not passed on, with the investigation finding this was likely to be because the staff responsible were “distracted” by other tasks. Cooper-Hall and her wife, Allison Cooper-Hall, said the investigation had highlighted “the failures in care, missed opportunities and delay in recognition of the severity and urgency of the situation”. “Our utter sadness and despair at losing Giles has been joined by anger and hurt as we now know that human error contributed to his death,” they said. “We should have come home with our baby – we will grieve for him for ever.” Ruth Cooper-Hall first alerted staff at Derriford hospital that her baby wasn’t moving as much as normal when she was 41 weeks pregnant. But she was discharged and reassured the team was “not concerned at all”. In fact, the HSIB investigation found staff had not carried out proper checks as the unit was “busy”. A senior doctor’s advice that the baby’s heartbeat should be continuously monitored was not passed on to staff on the ground. The investigation found it was likely the “multiple tasks” being carried out by the responsible clinician had acted as a “source of distraction”. Instead, the baby’s heart rate was checked only intermittently and without the recommended equipment, while new staff coming on duty repeatedly failed to check Cooper-Hall’s written records, so she was wrongly treated as a “routine” case, the investigation found. “Had the full plan of care been handed over between the clinicians caring for the mother, there may have been a different outcome for the baby,” the report said. Giles was delivered by forceps and had to be resuscitated for 20 minutes before his heartbeat was heard. But he was unable to breathe on his own, suffered blood loss and had brain damage from being starved of oxygen during labour. Later that day, his parents agreed he should begin palliative care and they were with him when he died at 8.30pm on 28 October. Ruth Cooper-Hall, now 38, added: “We had concerns at the time with the care we received in the delivery suite, including the inexperience of staff, the lack of communication, the lack of confidence and the environment of fluster and panic, but we left Derriford having been given the impression that what happened to Giles was just a tragic accident. “We thought it had all happened in the last 10 minutes of labour, but the report reveals such a larger timeframe of errors, missed opportunities and delay.” Peter Walsh, chief executive of the patient safety charity Action against Medical Accidents, said: “This is yet another tragic and avoidable loss of a baby … Too few staff and poor communication between overstretched staff. Maternity care is in a bad way and must be a top priority for more resources and improvement.” A spokesperson for University hospitals Plymouth NHS trust said: “All the safety recommendations stemming from the investigation will be fully implemented as part of our commitment to foster a culture of learning, development and improvement within the maternity setting. “Most importantly, we would like to thank the Cooper-Halls. May we again reiterate our most sincere condolences upon the sad loss of their son, Giles. The pain and distress they have experienced is immeasurable.”",News/Society,"Plymouth maternity staff missed chances to save baby’s life, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/10/plymouth-maternity-staff-missed-chances-to-save-babys-life-report-finds
5/10/2022,"Early polling centres across the country have opened for those unable to vote on Saturday 21 May. Voters in two key Sydney seats were undeterred by the rain on Monday and wasted no time in casting their votes. Guardian Australia asked people who they were voting for – and why. In the marginal seat of Wentworth in Sydney’s east on Monday, a queue of voters spilled from the prepoll centre on Oxford Street in Bondi Junction on to the footpath. The seat is held by the Liberal MP Dave Sharma on a margin of 1.3% and the desperation of his campaign and that of his main challenger, teal independent Allegra Spender, was on display. In a sign of just how close this contest is, Sharma approached and engaged with voters holding Greens material while waiting to vote. A majority of the voters the Guardian observed at the Bondi Junction prepoll centre on Monday skewed towards a more mature demographic that instinctively took Liberal how-to-vote cards. After all, the seat has been held by the Liberals since 1901 for all bar seven months. But many nearby workers used their lunch break to vote and some, such as Petra O’Neill, a Paddington hospitality worker, aren’t backing Sharma. She said she would be working on the Indian Pacific train from Sydney to Perth on 21 May, and therefore cast her vote early on Monday. She voted for Spender. O’Neill voted for Sharma at the 2019 election but says the absence of the prime minister Scott Morrison during the Black Summer bushfires and his record on climate action has swayed her vote. She said Spender was difficult for working-class residents to relate to, but would ultimately serve this demographic better than Sharma and a Coalition government. “I voted for Allegra, but she comes from a very privileged background. I don’t think she’s had as much experience as say, Zali Steggall, but the Liberals have done absolutely nothing for us. I have no faith in ScoMo,” O’Neill said. Sarah* said she thought Sharma and Spender – and the Liberal and Labor parties – had “good ideas and policies”. But she ultimately voted for Sharma “because I went with who would benefit me more and with the Liberals it’s going to be better for me in terms of income tax”. Luke*, who lives near the southern boundary of Wentworth, towards Randwick, said he voted for Sharma because he thought the Liberal party was better at economic management. “The Liberals will be better for me as a business owner,” he said. Asked if Spender’s policies on climate action appealed to him, Luke said “climate is very important to me, especially with daughters, but managing the country is really important too”. “It was balancing those issues and I think I voted for someone who has a party that can actually win the election.” Malcolm Smith, a Bondi Junction local, was one voter not swayed by corflutes and volunteers handing out flyers for Sharma and Spender. The self-described “crypto hound” voted for the United Australia party candidate Natalie Dumer. He preferenced Sharma ahead of Spender because he followed the UAP how-to-vote material. “The other parties let us down over the past two and a half years, so I had to give it to somebody outside of the two-party system,” Smith said. “I never thought I’d actually vote for Clive Palmer or someone like Pauline Hanson, but I just don’t think we’ve been able to have discussions about Covid. “Einstein said madness is doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting a different result – and I’m fed up with the two parties we’ve only ever had in government.” Both candidates were handing out how-to-vote material and talking to voters on Monday. Spender was also handing out Minties and Freddo frogs to her small army of volunteers wearing teal-coloured T-shirts. Across Sydney Harbour in the electorate of North Sydney, the Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman was on Monday attempting to win over voters at the Northside Conference Centre in St Leonards. Zimmerman, a moderate, holds the seat with a 9.3% margin but is under threat because the federal Liberal party and Morrison are considered on the nose. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Both Zimmerman and the Labor candidate, Catherine Renshaw, greeted voters at the entrance to the voting centre. Climate 200-backed independent Kylea Tink is the favoured challenger, but was isolating with Covid on Monday. Tink and another prominent candidate, Victor Kline of the TNL party (formerly known as the New Liberals), had several volunteers handing out material. Of the voters the Guardian observed at the centre, a significant chunk took only Labor how-to-vote material, and recognised Renshaw from her campaign. But Andy*, a business owner in St Leonards, said he voted for Zimmerman because he thought a Liberal government would be better for his manufacturing business. “It’s not anything against Labor policy, but it’s because we’ve been able to achieve a lot the past two years,” he said. Waverton voter Harriet* lives in Zimmerman’s old flat, but that connection was not enough to sway her decision on Monday. She voted for Tink. “I know Trent is a nice guy, but the poor bugger happens to belong to the wrong party. This is the party where the assistant minister for women went to an anti-abortion rally,” Harriet said, referring to Amanda Stoker. “The intellectual and ethical standard between the two major parties, especially with ScoMo, is beyond repugnant. I just want to see the guy humiliated, because there seems to be this ongoing persecution of anyone who didn’t go to the right school or who isn’t a straight male.” *Some voters requested their surnames not be published.",News/Australia news,‘The poor bugger belongs to the wrong party’: voters cast early ballots in Wentworth and North Sydney,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/10/the-poor-bugger-belongs-to-the-wrong-party-voters-cast-early-ballots-in-two-key-sydney-seats
5/10/2022,"A fourth dose of a Covid vaccine can ramp up the body’s immune defences beyond the peak achieved after a third dose, research suggests. A second booster – often a fourth dose of a Covid vaccine – is currently offered in the UK to those aged 75 or over, people living in care homes for older people, and those over the age of 12 who are immunosuppressed. Now researchers say they have found a fourth dose can rescue immune responses that have waned since a third jab. “We’ve demonstrated a fourth dose of Covid-19 vaccines can produce a substantial boost to both the antibody and cellular immunity when you give them more than six months after the third dose,” said Prof Saul Faust, who led the trial and is director of the NIHR Southampton clinical research facility. Writing in the Lancet Infectious Diseases, researchers involved in the UK-based Cov-Boost trial report how they measured immune responses in 166 participants who received a fourth Covid jab on average seven months after having had a Pfizer/BioNTech jab as their third dose. All participants had initially had either two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab or two doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. Half were randomly allocated to receive a full dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid jab as their fourth vaccination, while the others were given half a dose of the Moderna jab. No serious adverse events were linked to the vaccines. The team analysed data from 133 participants, finding that 14 days after receiving the fourth jab, there was a 1.6-fold increase in antibodies among those who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, and a more than twofold increase among those who received the half-dose Moderna jab, compared with 28 days after the third dose, when antibody levels were still at their peak. Increases were seen for those over and below 70 years of age. In addition, levels of antibodies and T-cells increased substantially between the day before the fourth vaccination and 14 days after for both types of fourth jab. “Our results for immunogenicity are also consistent with the little observational evidence on vaccine effectiveness available from Israel, which indicates increased protection against symptomatic infection and severe illness from a fourth-dose booster,” the team write. Faust added that those who had little waning of their immune responses before their fourth dose gained only a limited increase in their immune responses as a result of the booster – with similar findings for others who had a recent history of a Covid infection. “That indicates there may be a ceiling, a maximum antibody level with the T-cell response effects,” he said. Faust said it was up to the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation to decide whether a second booster should be offered more widely. Some experts have suggested in the current circumstances those yet to reach middle age might never be offered another Covid jab. But Prof Danny Altmann, an immunologist at Imperial College London, said Omicron still posed a serious threat, adding that the new study demonstrated the added value of a fourth dose. “Just because our first-generation vaccines wane rapidly and offer rather permeable protection nowadays, does not suggest we should give up and have no further boosters,” he said. “On the contrary, [given] many of us, even with high apparent antibody levels, actually show [very little] protective neutralisation of Omicron, there is all the more urgency to use [fourth] doses – in all age groups – to boost levels back up into the protective range.”",News/Society,"Fourth Covid jab can give higher immunity than initial booster, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/09/fourth-covid-jab-can-give-higher-immunity-than-initial-booster-study-finds
5/10/2022,"Jürgen Klopp has dismissed Pep Guardiola’s claim that the entire country wants Liverpool to win the title but insisted the Premier League would be boring without a serious rival to Manchester City. Guardiola claimed “everyone in this country supports Liverpool, the media and everyone” and “people want Liverpool to win more than us” in a bizarre outburst following City’s 5-0 rout of Newcastle on Sunday. Klopp believes the post-match interview illustrated the tension of the title race on Guardiola more than any statement of fact, and likened it to his criticism of Antonio Conte’s tactics after Tottenham’s 1-1 draw at Anfield on Saturday. But the Liverpool manager considers his team worthy of wider support for delivering a genuine title race and ensuring City do not win a fourth league championship in five seasons at a canter. “Imagine how the situation would be if we were not that close. Then the interviews would be boring,” Klopp said. “You have to make sure there is some excitement and there is an exciting battle for who stays in the league and an exciting battle for who qualifies for the Champions League. But imagine if we were not closer. “It [Guardiola’s reaction] is completely normal. We all feel the tension, we cannot say we don’t feel it. After the Tottenham game, it is not like I thought: ‘Great’, but before you can deal with your emotions you have already faced 20 cameras. That is what Pep did. I don’t take it as a backhanded compliment. He probably thought he has to make this point. You know much better than I do it is not the case.” Liverpool can go level on points with City on Tuesday with victory at Aston Villa, albeit having played one game more, but Klopp is adamant Guardiola is mistaken in his view that the country wants the title to return to Anfield. “I live in Liverpool so, yes, here a lot of people want us to win the league – that’s true,” Klopp said. “But even here it’s probably only 50% because the other people [Evertonians] were involved in another fight, at least until yesterday. “As managers, and I had this experience recently, we are obviously massively influenced by the game. I said – and would I say it again? No – but I said after the [Tottenham] game: ‘They play like they play and are still only fifth.’ It felt good in that moment but it was wrong. I could not respect Antonio more and what he is doing and how he organises teams. “I don’t know exactly which situation Pep was in, after getting knocked out of the Champions League that is obviously difficult enough to take, but then of course Liverpool made it to the final and you have these things like: ‘They only played Villarreal, we played Real,’ and then you say what you say. And he is right, on top of it. I was right about Tottenham. He was right we only won the Premier League once. I have no idea if the whole country is supporting us. That is not the feeling I get when we go to other places and play there, it is actually the opposite, but maybe he knows more about that than me.” Klopp insists Liverpool will not “stop believing” they can win the league until it is mathematically impossible. He also claimed the title challengers should take encouragement from their display against Spurs, despite dropping points for only the third time this year. “It was not a perfect game but the general approach, the counter press, was completely on a different level,” said the Liverpool manager, who could recall Roberto Firmino from injury at Villa Park. “We win it and we talk about that. ‘Wow, the counter press of Liverpool.’ We don’t win it and we just forget it. I don’t [forget it] because that keeps us going. “That is how I see it [nothing is broken]. That is how I saw the game. So we keep going. That is the nature of the thing and that is with the quality of the opponent and the goalkeeper and you know we had the situations [to win]. If Virg [van Dijk] gets the header here [forehead] instead of here [points to the side of his face], it is at least a better chance than hitting the bar. “We didn’t score from a set piece but we could have because everything was nearly perfect. We have to accept that. Now we have to use the good things, delete the bad things and go from here.”",Sport/Football,"Premier League needs Liverpool to challenge Manchester City, says Klopp",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/09/premier-league-needs-liverpool-to-challenge-manchester-city-says-klopp
5/10/2022,"Steven Gerrard has labelled the current Liverpool team the most satisfying to watch in the club’s history and insisted the thought of potentially scuppering their pursuit of the Premier League title and an unprecedented quadruple has not crossed his mind. Liverpool’s 1-1 draw with Tottenham on Saturday combined with Manchester City’s 5-0 victory against Newcastle the following day leaves Jürgen Klopp’s side three points behind the leaders and reigning champions with three games to play. They also have an inferior goal difference. Gerrard knows Villa will have to deliver the “perfect performance” when they host Liverpool on Tuesday, with the legendary former captain full of praise for Anfield’s latest team. “I think to watch they are probably the best, because of the speed, the intensity and the mentality of this current group,” Gerrard said. “But I say that without disrespecting previous successful Liverpool teams, because I grew up watching them, the European Cup winners, serial league title-winners, I grew up on all the DNA of that club. I’m well aware that they have had world-class players, managers and teams previously, but I think to watch – on the eye, because of the way the game has changed, it has gone quicker and faster – I think you’re probably watching the best Liverpool team there’s been.” Asked if he had played out in his head the scenario of possibly derailing Liverpool’s bid for the title, Gerrard replied: “Not really, no, and it didn’t when we competed against Burnley at the other end of the table last weekend [Villa won 3-1]. “Preparation is always about Aston Villa and preparing my team in the best way we can for whatever challenge faces us. Whoever I represent, I’ll go into the game wanting to win. The day I don’t have that urgency to win, I won’t be sitting in a seat like this.” Villa host Burnley in the penultimate game of their season before travelling to City on the final day. “The way the fixtures have fallen we can have a say in the title race – that is how it is,” Gerrard said. “We will try to win all of the games that are in front of us but we know Liverpool is going to be a massive challenge. “If the outcome is in our favour it would mean my team has gone above and beyond and performed extremely well. That is what it is going to take, to get the outcome we want, we need every single player at it, individually and collectively. There is no doubt about it, we need the perfect performance. That goes without saying. We also know that for us to achieve that we are going to have to probably post the best performance we have done so far.” Villa have accrued seven points from their past three matches and the game on Tuesday presents another opportunity to maintain their push for a top-half finish. “The first remit was to move the team into a safe place,” Gerrard said. “Top 10 would be a satisfactory end considering where we were when we took the job. We’re now in a place with four games left where there’s a possibility and that would be a huge positive considering the club hasn’t done it for a decade. That would give us a positive base to go and have a real strong pre-season from.” Jacob Ramsey will miss the game on Tuesday with a groin injury but the 18-year-old former Exeter midfielder Ben Chrisene, who played 90 minutes for Villa’s reserves on Friday, will return to the squad.

5/10/2022,"Boris Johnson’s government will force through police powers to prevent disruptive yet peaceful protests as one of 38 new bills in Tuesday’s Queen’s speech. In a move to reinstate measures thrown out by the House of Lords in January, the government will announce new offences to stop protesters from “locking on” to infrastructure, extend stop and search powers, and make it illegal to obstruct transport projects. The public order bill will be aimed at quashing tactics employed by protest groups such as Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain and Just Stop Oil. It will be seen as part of a plan by Johnson to boost his premiership with proposals which will appeal to core Tory supporters. The development came as Buckingham Palace announced on Monday night that the Queen will miss the state opening of parliament. The Prince of Wales will instead read the Queen’s speech for the first time on her behalf. In a move that will anger civil liberty groups, the new public order measures will include: New criminal offences of locking on, and going equipped to lock on to others, objects or buildings – carrying a maximum penalty of six months’ imprisonment and an unlimited fine. The creation of a new criminal offence of interfering with key national infrastructure, such as airports, railways and printing presses – carrying a maximum sentence of 12 months in prison and an unlimited fine. Measures to make it illegal to obstruct major transport works, including disrupting the construction or maintenance of projects like HS2 – punishable by up to six months in prison and an unlimited fine. The bill is expected to extend stop and search powers so the police can seize articles related to these new offences. New preventive “serious disruption prevention orders” will also be available for repeat offenders, a statement said. The home secretary, Priti Patel, first announced plans to disrupt the tactics of protesters last October at the Conservative party conference. But in January, peers rejected half a dozen government amendments to the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill which would have introduced the measures. Because the amendments were introduced in the House of Lords once the bill had passed through the Commons they could not be sent back to MPs. However, the latest plan will mean that the government can rely on its Commons majority to force through a new law. Commenting on the new measures, Patel said: “The public order bill will give the police the powers they need to clamp down on this outrageous behaviour and ensure the British public can go about their lives without disruption.” The programme includes seven bills intended to remove EU regulation, covering areas from data reform to gene editing and financial services. Other new laws are expected to try to boost economic growth across the country to address the cost of living crisis. The government will also try to create the conditions for more people to have high wage, high skilled jobs, and keep the public safe, a statement said. Announcing a “mission to deliver”, Johnson will say: “This Queen’s speech will get our country back on track, and I will strive – and this government will strive – night and day to deliver it. “Because in spite of everything we have been through, we are going to ensure that over the two years we have left in this parliament, we spend every second uniting and levelling up this country, exactly as we said we would.” Following Conservative backbench concerns over the cost of living crisis, the government is widely expected to make announcements on its energy strategy. Other expected announcements include changes to Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit border arrangements and a replacement for the Human Rights Act.

With more than 90% of an initial count concluded, Marcos Jr had almost 30 million votes, more than double the tally of his closest rival, the current vice-president, Leni Robredo, a former human rights lawyer. Supporters dressed in red shirts, his campaign colour, gathered outside his camp’s headquarters in Mandaluyong City on Monday night, waving the flag of the Philippines as passing cars sounded their horns. Marcos thanked volunteers and political leaders “that have cast their lot with us” in a late-night video message, but he stopped short of claiming victory. “Let’s wait until it’s very clear, until the count reaches 100%, then we can celebrate,” he said. “I hope you won’t get tired of trusting us,” Marcos also told supporters in remarks streamed on Facebook. “We have plenty of things to do,” he said, adding “an endeavour as large as this does not involve one person.” Marcos Jr, 64, ran with the slogan “Together we shall rise again”, invoking nostalgia for his father’s authoritarian regime, which the family and its supporters have portrayed as a golden era in a campaign fuelled by online disinformation as social media has been flooded with false stories that have swept aside the atrocities and corruption widespread during the period. Such portrayals have horrified survivors of Marcos Sr’s brutal regime. Thousands of political opponents were tortured, arrested and disappeared under his rule, while as much as $10bn (£8bn) was plundered. Marcos Sr was ousted in the People Power revolution in 1986, when the family was humiliatingly airlifted from the presidential palace by helicopter, and fled into exile. Ever since, say analysts, the Marcoses have sought to rebrand themselves and regain their place in politics. “The disinformation infrastructure has been there for a long time. It’s not as if it just sprouted during this campaign. The Marcoses’ plan to reach the presidency has been in action for decades,” said Aries Arugay, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, who is based in Manila. Marcos Jr had maintained a clear lead over his opponents in surveys conducted in the run-up to the vote, with Robredo second. A former human rights lawyer who has advocated for marginalised groups, she campaigned on a promise of good governance and an end to corruption. People began lining up to vote before polling centres opened at 6am local time (2300 BST) on Monday morning, and some waited more than four hours in the heat as malfunctioning voting machines caused delays. The vote followed three months of fierce campaigning, in which 2 million Robredo volunteers launched an unprecedented door-to-door campaign to try to win over voters and counter the onslaught of online disinformation. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, Robredo delivered a statement to her supporters, saying the voice of the people was “getting clearer and clearer.” “In the name of the Philippines, which I know you also love so dearly, we should hear this voice because in the end, we only have this one nation to share.” She told her supporters that a movement had been born, and said the fight for reforms would not end with the elections. “Press for the truth. It took long for the structure of lies to be erected. We have the time and opportunity now to fight and dismantle this.” On Tuesday in Manila, crowds, many wearing black, gathered in front of the Comelec office, the Commission on Elections, protesting against the return of the Marcoses and alleging cheating. Marcos Jr’s candidacy has polarised opinion, and some do not believe that the family has plundered state wealth, despite court rulings at home and abroad. At Santa Ana elementary school, in a residential area of Manila, which opened as a polling station, Raquel Deguzaman, 59, said she supported Marcos Jr and did not believe the family was corrupt. “[Marcos Sr] was able to help the Philippines. He’s really good,” she said, adding that he had built infrastructure, including hospitals. Jack Drescher, 58, who was on his way to vote, also cited the building of infrastructure under Marcos Sr as a reason for backing his son. He was not concerned about corruption within the family, he said. “He has a lot of gold so he won’t steal any money,” he said, adding that he had heard this from YouTube. A myth claiming that the Marcoses own large stashes of gold has circulated online in various forms for years, including the claim that it will be given back to the people if the family is returned to power. Although Marcos Jr has denied the existence of any organised online campaign, he was the overwhelming beneficiary of false claims circulating on social media. The majority of disinformation was either designed to undermine Robredo’s reputation or enhance the images of the Marcoses, according to analysis by the fact-checking coalition Tsek.ph, which monitored disinformation in the run-up to the election. Marcos Jr has avoided TV debates and challenging media interviews ahead of the election, and his campaign has been thin on policy detail. The idea that Marcos Sr’s rule was a prosperous and peaceful era appeals to a generation of voters who did not live through Marcos Sr’s martial law regime, including those who “may harbour deep dissatisfaction with the non-inclusive development of the past 30 or so years,” said Ronald Mendoza, dean of Manila’s Ateneo school of government. Cleo Anne A Calimbahin, an associate professor of political science at De La Salle University Manila, said the results should not come as a surprise but that they were sobering. They reflected in part a growing frustration among the public with previous administrations. “I think this is a response of a public that saw the lack of progress made since 1986,” said Calimbahin, referencing the People Power revolution that put the Philippines on the road to democracy, a process that has not been linear. “Unfortunately, the reforms agenda and its inability to deliver since 1986 has made people even wary of reformist candidates,” said Calimbahin.The election winner will take office on 30 June for a single six-year term.",News/World news,Ferdinand Marcos triumphs in Philippines presidential election,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/ferdinand-marcos-jr-triumph-philippines-presidential-election
5/10/2022,"Good morning. A pro-Kremlin outlet has called Vladimir Putin a “paranoid dictator” in a rare act of dissent. Patients are increasingly waiting more than 24 hours for a bed in overcrowded Victorian emergency departments. And Guardian Australia has spoken to early voters in two key Sydney seats. With 12 days to go in the federal election campaign, both leaders are shifting into higher gear. After questions about stamina following his Covid recovery, the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, yesterday cheerfully told his trailing press pack that he was hitting three states in a day, a marked uptick in the pace of his campaign. Labor and the Coalition had big ticket announcements yesterday, with Albanese pledging more than $346m for a hospital upgrade and to boost teacher workforce numbers, while Scott Morrison talked up $8bn in military spending on helicopters and infrastructure. With two leaders’ debates down and one to go tomorrow, the home stretch is within sight. But early polling centres in two key Sydney seats may reveal the direction this could go. Guardian Australia asked people who they were voting for – and why. Two Russian journalists working for a popular pro-Kremlin website filled it with anti-war articles in a rare act of dissent as the country celebrated the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany. The articles on Lenta.ru called Vladimir Putin a “pitiful paranoid dictator” and accused him of waging “the bloodiest war of the 21st century”. “We had to do it today,” said Egor Polyakov, one of the two journalists. “We wanted to remind everyone what our grandfathers really fought for on this beautiful Victory Day – for peace.” During his annual speech in front of 11,000 soldiers in the Kremlin, Putin sought to justify his invasion of Ukraine, tying the fighting to the Soviet victory in the second world war. Peak healthcare bodies in Victoria are calling for real-time data on emergency departments, warning that staff are being forced to work “blind” amid unprecedented pressure. The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine has labelled the situation in hospitals across the country a “national emergency” and its Victorian chair, Dr Mya Cubitt, said hospitals needed a statewide dashboard with real-time data. Peter Dutton’s department says the defence minister is in possession of six reports from the oversight panel regarding the Brereton reforms – but he is yet to disclose any details about what it found. Far from having a leftwing bias, the ABC has been tamed by cuts and incessant attacks, former prime minister Kevin Rudd says. Under the Coalition, the national broadcaster has been domesticated to the point of overcorrecting for perceived partisanship, he says. Ten weeks after Lismore first flooded, fewer than one in six applications for the NSW government’s business grants have been approved. Praise for Josh Frydenberg, the “prince of tennis” and “super scholar” is circulating on the Chinese-language internet platform WeChat targeting the Kooyong community, whose votes will be critical on election day. Reforms to reduce the use of grants for pork barrelling need to be enacted before next March’s state election if the NSW government wants to protect its credibility, crossbenchers and a former supreme court judge have said. A chorus of crossbenchers have demanded that the premier, Dominic Perrottet, introduce legislation based on recommendations handed to the government at the weekend. Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the son and namesake of the late dictator, is set to become the Philippines’ next president after taking an unassailable lead in the election, signalling an extraordinary rehabilitation of one of the country’s most notorious political families. Elon Musk has warned that Japan will “cease to exist” unless it addresses its falling birthrate, sparking calls for the country to allow more immigration and improve its work-life balance. Emmanuel Macron has called for a new political organisation to unite democracies on the European continent, as he warned that Ukraine would probably not join the EU for several decades. Mahinda Rajapaksa has resigned as Sri Lanka’s prime minister after months of protest over the country’s deepening economic crisis and calls for leaders from the ruling family dynasty to step down. When evangelical Americans began talking about Donald Trump as God’s chosen president, the religious phrasing around his leadership – miracles, destiny, calling – triggered something in the memories of Lynette Wallworth, the Emmy-winning Australian virtual reality film-maker. As a young woman, she had been drawn into a Pentecostal community and came to hold “extreme beliefs” about God’s will. She became a “prophetess”; fellow members would come to her with questions to hear her “give prophecy” from literal and earnest biblical interpretations. With her latest work, she hopes to stop others from doing what she did. In a landmark exhibition supported by the resources sector, Indigenous artists from the Pilbara don’t hold back about dispossession and exploitation. “This is a protest painting,” says Martumili artist Desmond Taylor. “We’re hoping to get back the land that was taken away from us. This is our story, this is our home, this is our way of finding connection to country.” Over the last two years, most of us have experienced the sting of a party cancellation – from weddings and galas to school formals. There was a period when crowded dancefloors and uncomfortably high heels felt like a thing of the past. Happily, it’s 2022, and we are – hopefully – post-lockdowns and limits on gatherings. To celebrate, well, the return of celebrations, here is some expert advice on the special care everything from tulle, to beading, to lace requires. With house prices and rents continuing to soar across Australia, the major parties are talking up their respective homebuying policies on the campaign trail. But will these policies actually fix Australia’s housing affordability crisis? Laura Murphy-Oates speaks to economics reporter Peter Hannam and Prof Hal Pawson about the housing policies of Labor, the Coalition and the Greens, and what impact they would have on housing affordability.

5/10/2022,"Patrick Roberts scored on the final day of last season to help send Sheffield Wednesday down to League One, and the winger condemned the Owls to another season in the third tier with an stoppage-time winner to put Sunderland 90 minutes away from promotion. The match was heading into extra-time after Lee Gregory slid the ball home to cancel out Ross Stewart’s first-leg winner but Roberts pounced in the 10 minutes of time added on to earn victory for Sunderland thanks to fine work by Jack Clarke on the left, who tricked his way inside the box before fizzing the ball into the path of Roberts. The duo once cost a combined £21m, which proved handy to Alex Neil. Sunderland have failed to earn promotion in their previous six attempts in the playoffs but they are currently 15 games unbeaten and Trafalgar Square will be packed before their trip to Wembley to face Wycombe. “I just think as a coach, the one thing that you want is for your team to represent you,” Neil said. “I would regard myself as being determined, being focused, knowing what I want and doing what I can to get it. And I think this team completely represents me in how they want them to go about it, which unfortunately, I never had as a player.” A packed Hillsborough roared every touch from a Wednesday player in the early stages. The biggest cheer of the opening five minutes was saved for Sunderland’s Alex Pritchard when he leapt over an outstretched leg on the edge of the box, only for the referee and home supporters to show the midfielder what they thought of his artistic attempt to win a free-kick. Barry Bannan’s intelligence on the ball ensured the surround sound did not stop. Whenever the midfielder collected a pass, the volume was raised in expectation that he would find his passing range. Bannan raised the noise levels once more just before the half-hour mark when he slid in to catch Pritchard on the top of his boot with his studs, forcing referee, James Linington, to take out his yellow card, much to the disgust of Hillsborough. It took 35 minutes for a shot on target, and it came in an unlikely form. A Wednesday corner was sent back into the box where George Byers choreographed a perfect overhead kick, only to send the ball straight into Anthony Patterson’s waiting arms. Sunderland were better at disrupting Wednesday in the second half, upsetting the home team and fans alike. There was a demand for urgency to avoid the game slowing down but poorly-timed challenges and misplaced passes allowed the visitors to keep the game at more sedate to increase frustration inside Hillsborough. Clarke showed his dribbling ability on the hour mark; he ran across the box searching for an opening to fire at goal and when he could not find one, he laid the ball off to Roberts whose curling shot was easily held by Bailey Peacock-Farrell. It took a moment of Championship quality in a game firmly mired in the third tier to finally take the roof off Hillsborough. Bannan’s defence-splitting pass to help set up Gregory’s finish was needed in a match more focused on tackling and time-wasting than skill and ability. After 74 minutes of irritation, Hillsborough could scratch the itch. Bannan slipped a pass inside Lyndon Gooch for Marvin Johnson to run on to and cut back straight into Gregory’s path, gifting him the chance to tap home from a few yards out thanks to his slick movement. All the blue and white frustration was released, replaced with ecstasy and bouncing stands. Since helping Derby survive at Wednesday’s expense last season, Roberts has endured an unsuccessful spell in France with Troyes. The winger is still trying to fulfil the potential that made Manchester City pay £11m for him as a teenager and silencing Hillsborough could be the first step on the road to redemption. The next one could be made at Wembley. “We’re disappointed for the players but that’s football,” Wednesday manager Darren Moore said. “I’ve said you’ve got to take it on the chin, it has its beautiful parts, and sometimes it can kick you right where it hurts. We’ll have to regroup.”",Sport/Football,Roberts sinks Sheffield Wednesday and sends Sunderland to Wembley,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/09/sheffield-wednesday-sunderland-league-one-playoff-semi-final-second-leg-match-report
5/10/2022,"Who could have foreseen, when Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu was born in what is now Skopje, North Macedonia, in August 1910, that she would become one of the icons of the 20th century, recognised across the globe as Mother Teresa, saintly giver of comfort to the destitute? More specifically, who could have predicted that she would embody so much of what was wrong with that century and the next? The three-part documentary Mother Teresa: For the Love of God? (Sky Documentaries) sets out the pros and cons of Teresa mania, finding the good to be fragile and the bad, profound.Briskly we are given the backstory of a family made vulnerable by the death – perhaps by poisoning – of their patriarch, after which they leaned heavily on the church. Having moved to India and become a nun, Anjezë heard the voice of Jesus calling her on a train near Darjeeling in 1946. By 1969, she was revered enough under the name Mother Teresa of Calcutta – as the boss of donation-funded sanctuaries for orphans, people with leprosy and the dying – for a laudatory BBC film to be made about her. The attention boosted Teresa’s effort to expand her organisation, Missionaries of Charity, beyond India, opening orders around the world. For the Love of God? tries to offer an unimpeachably balanced range of contributors. In the absence of the late Christopher Hitchens, the writer best known for cutting down Teresa, Aroup Chatterjee, whose work inspired Hitchens’ film about her, appears, offset by a couple of friendly biographers and with first-hand witnesses to the work of Missionaries of Charity in the middle. The problem, for Teresa’s defenders, at least, is that as soon as you mount a description of her that goes into more detail than “she spent her life caring for the poor”, the illusion melts.An American woman who signed up for the mission, and who felt an electric charge akin to romantic love when Teresa put a hand on her as a welcome blessing, describes how the nuns’ devotion required being cut off from newspapers, radio and contact with friends. A craze for self-flagellation developed among the “sisters”, inspired by Teresa’s dictum that “love, to be real, has to hurt”. Even a man who was a Kolkata orphan stricken with polio in the late 1970s, and who credits the Missionaries of Charity with saving his life, talks of the psychological effects of the sometimes “brutal” atmosphere. Episode one’s killer witness is Dr Jack Preger, whose 40 years as a “street physician” in Kolkata brought him into contact with Teresa’s sanitoriums. “The nuns were not delivering proper care,” he remembers, visibly hurt at the memory. “Needles were used over and over again. They were blunt.” This is the most serious charge levelled at Teresa: that there was insufficient practical assistance, and perhaps even outright neglect, behind the rhetoric about selflessly attending the needy. What is extraordinary about the stronger version of that accusation – that Teresa embodied a pain-cult version of Christianity that does not want to alleviate suffering – is that she basically agreed. Over to one of the friendly biographers, reporting what her idol used to say: “Our calling is not necessarily to cure. It is to pass on the love of God to every human being in whom we see the suffering Christ … suffering shared with Christ’s passion is a wonderful thing.” Archive clips of adulatory TV interviews show how, once the brand was established, complaints about this startling ethos were dismissed as heresy, with the backing of the powerful. For the Love of God? shows how figures such as Teresa are a key component of unjust societies, dabbing balm on the consciences of those who send “thoughts and prayers” to the vulnerable while ensuring they remain so. It is OK for us to concentrate wealth in fewer and fewer hands at the expense of the masses: someone, somewhere will help them. One thinks of David Cameron tweeting photographs of himself visiting food banks he helped to create, having encouraged the “big society” to care so that he didn’t have to.But, by happenstance, the programme is more timely than that. Next week, the series delves into the rise of the American religious right in the 1980s under Ronald Reagan, and how Teresa helped it by campaigning against the “pure murder” of abortion. Such hatred is afoot again in the US. Harsh as For the Love of God? may have ended up being on an individual whose flaws were magnified by a fame she couldn’t control, the portrait showing where dogma and hysteria can lead is painfully pertinent.Anyway, she would not have minded. For the Love of God? ends its opening instalment with a statement from Missionaries of Charity, which continues Teresa’s work: “If she were alive today, she would pray for her accusers and forgive them.”",Arts/Television & radio,Mother Teresa: For the Love of God? review – damning testimony from a killer witness,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/09/mother-teresa-love-of-god-review-damning-testimony-killer-witness-saintly-flagellation
5/10/2022,"Manu Tuilagi’s previous ploys to stay injury-free have included going to see a witch doctor, walking the Peak District, and weight loss – but now the England centre has concluded there is no substitute for sleep. Tuilagi is fit again, in form, and if he was unable to prevent Sale from exiting the Champions Cup at the quarter-final stage for the second consecutive season on Sunday he demonstrated his sharpness with a well-taken try on the stroke of half-time that would have thrilled Eddie Jones. With the Premiership playoffs a distant prospect for Sale, Tuilagi is likely to have just two more domestic matches this season but, provided there are no further injury problems, he is certain to tour Australia with England for a three-match series Jones’s side cannot afford to lose. For Tuilagi, it has yet again been a stop-start season blighted by injury with another Six Nations campaign missed and 10 appearances for the Sharks. He is learning to accept the logic in sitting out the odd match – he was rested for Sale’s victory against Newcastle to ensure he was primed to face Racing 92 – but there is fuel in the tank to face the Wallabies and, all going well, serve as a reminder as to why England’s hopes at the World Cup next year largely hinge on his fitness. During the Six Nations, Tuilagi was due to play against Wales, having recovered from the hamstring injury sustained last autumn against South Africa. He had a setback in training just before that match, however, and having made only two appearances for Sale before being called upon by England the national side faced questions over rushing him back too quickly. Not from Sale it should be said, but Alex Sanderson, the club’s director of rugby, conceded that more dialogue between club and country would benefit all parties, with Sale having already borrowed a GPS unit from England so that the national coaches could monitor his progress. For Tuilagi, the key is recognising the need to recover, and to rest. “I think sleep is a big thing for me,” he said. “I never used to sleep … I used to sleep really late. For an athlete you need, for me, at least seven hours. So that’s what I looked at when the latest hammy happened. If you keep doing the same thing, you are going to get the same result. So you’ve got to change something. “I had a chat with my wife, actually. I was talking to her, saying to her about how I woke up 20 minutes, 30 minutes before we had the walk-throughs and then you get into training … like, I am saying to her sometimes it’s actually hard, you have to take ownership of it and be honest with yourself, because only you know what’s happened. And my wife is saying: ‘You’re an athlete, you’ve got to sleep.’ We had that chat and then you’ve just got to be honest with yourself. And you’ve got to change something if you want a different result.” If Tuilagi made a conscious effort to trim a few pounds at the end of last season, he has lost nothing in terms of power. His mental strength is arguably his greatest asset, however, time and again demonstrating an ability to stay sanguine whenever the latest injury setbacks strike. “I am really thankful for those injuries that I came through,” he said. “And just in life you are definitely going to go through some hard times – I bet you guys have come through some tough times in your life – and that’s a good thing, because you can only learn from that, as a feeling. You can’t learn from someone else’s mistakes, because you don’t feel it. But when you have that, you’ve got to embrace it. It’s not good at the time but you look back and think: ‘Yah, it was good, that.’ “It’s more the mental side of the game that is much more important than the physical side of the game. The game is so physical nowadays, but if your mind is stronger, mentally, nothing can stop you. You have to listen your body but as an athlete sometimes you get too excited and you just want to be out there on the field. And you ignore what your body is telling you. You’ve just got to listen to it. Because if your body says no, you can’t do anything.”",Sport/Sport,Manu Tuilagi believes sleep holds key to staying fit for Sale and England,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/09/manu-tuilagi-sale-england-summer-tour-australia
5/10/2022,"The year the world breaches for the first time the 1.5C global heating limit set by international governments is fast approaching, a new forecast shows. The probability of one of the next five years surpassing the limit is now 50%, scientists led by the UK Met Office found. As recently as 2015, there was zero chance of this happening in the following five years. But this surged to 20% in 2020 and 40% in 2021. The global average temperature was 1.1C above pre-industrial levels in 2021. It is also close to certain – 93% – that by 2026 one year will be the hottest ever recorded, beating 2016, when a natural El Niño climate event supercharged temperatures. It is also near certain that the average temperature of the next five years will be higher than the past five years, as the climate crisis intensifies. “The 1.5C figure is not some random statistic. It is rather an indicator of the point at which climate impacts will become increasingly harmful for people and indeed the entire planet,” said Prof Petteri Taalas, head of the World Meteorological Organization, which published the new report. “For as long as we continue to emit greenhouse gases, temperatures will continue to rise,” said Taalas. “Alongside that, our oceans will continue to become warmer and more acidic, sea ice and glaciers will continue to melt, sea level will continue to rise and our weather will become more extreme.” Natural climate cycles can nudge global temperatures up or down. But the Paris Agreement requires nations to hold the underlying rise, driven by human activities, to well below 2C, as well as pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5C. The world’s scientists warned in 2018 that 1.5C of global heating will bring severe impacts to billions of people. “A single year of exceedance above 1.5C does not mean we have breached the iconic threshold of the Paris Agreement, but it does reveal that we are edging ever closer to a situation where 1.5C could be exceeded for an extended period,” said Dr Leon Hermanson, at the Met Office. “The possibility of surpassing the 1.5C threshold, even if only for a year, is worrying,” said Dr Andrew King, at the University of Melbourne. “Our greenhouse gas emissions are still at near-record highs and until we get emissions down to net zero we’re going to continue to see global warming. Rapid and drastic emissions reductions are needed urgently.” “To actually exceed the [Paris] target we’d have to be above 1.5C even in a ‘normal’ year” unaffected by natural climate variations, said Prof Steven Sherwood at the University of New South Wales. “But the report reminds us that we are getting uncomfortably close to this target.” The annual forecast harnesses the best prediction systems from climate centres around the world to produce practical information for decision-makers. It found a higher chance of rain in 2022 compared with the average of the past 30 years in northern Europe, the Sahel, north-east Brazil and Australia, while drier conditions than usual are forecast for south-western Europe and south-western North America. Prof Taalas also warned of especially rapid heating at the north pole: “Arctic warming is disproportionately high and what happens in the Arctic affects all of us.” The shrinking of sea ice and its knock-on effects have been linked to extreme weather events in Europe, the North America and Asia, including heatwaves, floods and even snowstorms. The forecast indicates that the rise in Arctic temperatures will be three times greater than the global average over the next five years.",News/Environment,"Climate limit of 1.5C close to being broken, scientists warn",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/09/climate-limit-of-1-5-c-close-to-being-broken-scientists-warn
5/10/2022,"The Washington Post has won the 2022 Pulitzer prize for public service journalism, for The Attack, its account of the deadly assault on the US Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump on 6 January 2021. The paper beat two other finalists: the New York Times, for challenging official accounts of US military engagements in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, for an exposé of electrical fires in city rental operations. The Pulitzers, administered by Columbia University in New York and considered the most prestigious prizes in US journalism, recognise work in 15 journalism categories and seven arts categories. The winner of the public service award receives a gold medal. Winners of other categories get $15,000. A bipartisan Senate committee linked seven deaths to the assault on the Capitol, which happened after Trump told supporters to “fight like hell” to overturn his election defeat by Joe Biden. The attack did not succeed in stopping certification of Biden’s victory. Trump was impeached for inciting an insurrection. The impeachment was the most bipartisan ever but the former president was acquitted when enough Senate Republicans stayed loyal. Trump therefore remains free to run for the White House again. A House committee is preparing for public hearings in its investigation of the riot, which has produced a charge of criminal contempt of Congress against Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist. Bannon has pleaded not guilty. More than 800 people have been charged over the Capitol attack, some, members of a far-right militia, with seditious conspiracy. Announcing the prize, the administrator of the Pulitzer prizes, Marjorie Miller, saluted the Post for its “compellingly told and vividly presented account of the assault on Washington … providing the public with a thorough understanding of one of the nation’s darkest days”. Sally Buzzbee, executive editor of the Post, said: “There is nothing more central to the American experiment than democracy … in 2021, that democracy came under attack from within. “The challenge for the fourth estate was clear: we were no longer just a watchdog of the institutions and elected leaders of our democracy, but an indispensable defender of democracy itself.” Buzzbee also saluted “more than 100” of her journalists for “fearless, consistent and comprehensive work … read and watched by millions [and] cited in congressional investigations”. The intersection of health, safety and infrastructure played a prominent role among other winning projects. The Tampa Bay Times won the investigative reporting award for Poisoned, an in-depth look into a polluting lead factory. The paper’s editor and vice-president, Mark Katches, said the win was “a testament to the importance of a vital local newsroom like the Times”. The Miami Herald took the breaking news award for its work covering the deadly Surfside condo tower collapse, while the Better Government Association and the Chicago Tribune won the local reporting award for Deadly Fires, Broken Promises, an examination of a lack of enforcement of fire safety standards. The Miami Herald’s executive editor, Monica Richardson, said: “As a newsroom, we poured our hearts into the breaking news and the ongoing daily coverage, and subsequent investigative coverage, of the Champlain Towers South condominium collapse story. “It was our story to tell because the people and the families in Surfside who were impacted by this unthinkable tragedy are a part of our community.” The Pulitzer prizes also awarded a special citation to journalists from Ukraine, acknowledging their “courage, endurance and commitment” in covering the Russian invasion. Last August, the Pulitzer board granted a special citation to Afghan journalists who help produce news and images from their own war-torn country. In the arts categories, Joshua Cohen won the fiction prize with The Netanyahus: An Account of a Minor and Ultimately Even Negligible Episode in the History of a Very Famous Family. Inspired by the story of the former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s father trying to get a job in academia, it won the 2021 National Jewish Book Award for Fiction.

5/10/2022,"Spike, the quarrelsome dachshund, got something every meal, even as the humans trapped in the bunker under Azovstal steelworks were wasting away from hunger. By the end there was so little food and water that adults were eating one tiny meal a day. Two cups of macaroni went into 10 litres of water, and that ‘soup’ had to feed 30 people. The children ate twice. Still, they all shared their food with their pet. “Someone would give him a spoon of porridge and everyone in the family would give him three or four spoons when they ate. Luckily, he is small,” said Olena Chekhonatski. She fled underground to escape shelling at the start of the war with her husband, Yegor, and two sons, 12-year-old Artem and 17-year-old Dmitry. They expected to stay perhaps two weeks, but only emerged two months later. “I was never a dog person before Spike arrived,” she said with a rueful glance at the dog she starved herself to keep alive, as he bounded along the sandy shore of the Dnieper river on the family’s first day of freedom since late February. The family were in the very last group of civilians officially evacuated from Azovstal, arriving in Ukrainian-held territory on the evening before Putin declared his war as a “sacred” mission to liberate people like their family, at a military parade in Moscow. “What liberation? What was the reason for all that?” Olena asked. “Our first feeling is disbelief we made it out. The last days we were losing hope. The shelling was so heavy, it seemed impossible to get out,” Yegor added. While the family thought that they might be in the bunker for two weeks, others they sheltered with had prepared for only two days. More than two months later, they were still there, supplies of food and water dwindling as the buildings above them were ripped apart by Russian bombs. They had been deprived of almost everything except sleep. “Sleep more, eat less. Because when you are asleep, you don’t need to eat,” Yegor said. “The plan now is to keep on living. The rest will follow.” When they moved in, there was electricity, but their world rapidly shrank in the mouldy basement, its dank smell seeping into their clothes and skin. The electricity was cut off after a day, and there was no internet, just a small radio that could pick up some longwave transmissions. They used car batteries to power LED lights, and in the gloom tried to make the hours pass with games. They had brought chess, backgammon and cards, and someone made a Mariupol monopoly set, with the city’s industrial plants and malls replacing the streets of London. They can laugh about some things now. They foraged for food in the remains of a warehouse that had been bombed by the Russians, and one day Yegor went with two older men, who insisted on joining them despite their failing strength and eyesight. One came back with coffee beans he had mistaken for small pasta shapes and a giant bag of bay leaves. Neither helped with hunger, but they decided to crush the coffee with a hammer. “I should say, it was a great cup of coffee,” he said. But every day was a gamble with death. Even a trip to the toilet meant risking their lives, because the latrines were on the ground floor. For children and older and disabled people, there were buckets in the shelter, which the adults took turns emptying. “No one came out of there unchanged,” said Oksana, an Azovstal employee who asked not to give her full name for security reasons. “They were one person when they went in, and another person when they came out.” In the early days, the children were obviously traumatised, she said. The teenagers spent hours staring at the walls, the younger children shied away from touch, and when she encouraged them to draw, they avoided the coloured pens and would do pictures only in black. Over time they adjusted a little to their terrifying new existence. “Later they let us hug them, especially during the bombing. They made friends, and the older kids taught the younger kids. There was a four-year-old who could barely read the alphabet when they arrived, but by the end he could do maths and read and write well.” Oksana herself has emerged with three talismans from her descent into horror: her husband’s teaspoon, from his work canteen; drawings by the children she guided through this time; and a passport cover with gleaming beadwork that she added herself, the only piece of her work she has left from a favourite hobby. “I have nothing else from home.” They tried to leave when a ‘green corridor’ was announced in early March, but were driven back underground by fighting. They had watched dozens of people leave before them, including residents of a neighbouring bunker that ran out of food weeks before they did, but each trip was a gamble. “When the children went outside, we made tags on their clothes with their names, blood types and date of birth. So at least if they were killed it would be easier to identify the bodies,” Oksana said. One group decided to hike the 100km to Berdyansk, through battlefields, minefields and ruins, because that seemed less terrifying than staying at the plant. “We don’t know if they made it.” Then they heard about the final attempts to set up civilian rescue corridors on the radio and decided to see if they could find a way out. Soldiers found them waiting outside, and said they had 15 minutes to get ready. They worry that there may be other desperate civilians trapped under the plant, who didn’t have radios to learn about the evacuation, or weren’t found by the soldiers. At a Russian “filtration” camp, where evacuees are searched by authorities, the Chekhonatski family met a teenager who had spent the whole war hiding in a basement a few dozen metres from theirs with two other men. They had no idea he was there. They also worry about the troops who got them out, through the ruined complex. “Not even heroes … I don’t know how to describe it. There’s no word to express all our gratitude for what they’ve done for us,” Yegor said. “I beg God, I hope some miracle happens and they make it out of there alive.” Oksana was overwhelmed, when she was finally able to charge her phone and turn it on after two months, to find a flood of messages from family, relatives and friends from across Ukraine and around the world. Many were the beneficiaries of a charity where she worked, which provided food and other aid to families with young children. “I never imagined I would be the one needing help.” Artem Mazhulin contributed to the reporting on this story",News/World news,‘What liberation?’: Mariupol survivors rescued from last civilian bunker describe horrors of siege ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/what-liberation-mariupol-survivors-rescued-from-last-bunker-describe-horrors-of-siege

5/10/2022,"Scores of inmates are feared dead in Ecuador after a deadly prison riot broke out between rival drugs gangs, in the latest bloody episode of a wave of violence that has engulfed the country’s prisons. Forty-three prisoners were confirmed dead on Monday as more than 200 police commandos retook control of the maximum-security wing of the Santo Domingo de los Tsáchilas prison, about two hours drive from the capital Quito, but the death-toll is likely to rise. Interior minister Patricio Carrillo told reporters that the majority of the victims had been “executed with bladed weapons”. It is Ecuador’s sixth deadly prison massacre since the beginning of 2021 pushing the death toll to nearly 400 as violence has spiked to unprecedented levels fuelled by rivalry between drug trafficking gangs. More than 300 inmates were slaughtered in the country’s prisons last year, including one massacre in Guayaquil’s Litoral penitentiary in which 119 prisoners lost their lives. Gruesome images on social media showed mutilated bodies strewn in a courtyard in the jail. Meanwhile, local television broadcast images which have become all too familiar to Ecuadorean viewers, showing dozens of relatives, mostly women, who had gathered outside the jail desperate for news of their loved ones. “There was really a lot of cruelty,” Ecuador’s police chief, Fausto Salinas, told journalists, adding that hand grenades, machine guns, revolvers and ammunition had been found at the jail. Earlier on Monday, he told local television that the immediate trigger for the violence was the transfer of a gang leader from another prison. “The presence of this person generated conflict and violence,” he said, criticising the judicial authorities who ordered the transfer. This latest massacre is the first large-scale violent incident in the Santo Domingo prison this year. In February 2021, 33 inmates were killed in the same prison, many of them decapitated and dismembered, as part of a simultaneous attack coordinated by criminal gangs in different prisons that left a total of 78 dead throughout the country. Analysts say the spike in prison violence began when local criminal gangs began vying to work with the rival Mexican Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation drug cartels. Ecuador – which sits between Colombia and Peru, the world’s two largest cocaine-producing countries – is a strategic smuggling route due to its long Pacific coastline and large shipping and fishing fleets. In the first four months of this year, Ecuadorean authorities have seized 85 tonnes of cocaine, twice the amount seized the year before. Ecuador’s president Guillermo Lasso, who was on an official visit to Israel, expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and said: “This is the unfortunate result of gang violence,” in a tweet.",News/World news,Ecuador prison riot leaves 43 dead in latest bloody episode ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/ecuador-prison-riot-leaves-scores-dead
5/10/2022,"The first group of people will be informed this week of the government’s intention to send them to Rwanda under its controversial relocation scheme, the Home Office has said. Under plans announced last month, people arriving illegally in the UK via Channel crossings and other routes will be detained and sent to the east African nation to apply for asylum there. The government has said it expects tens of thousands of people to be relocated under the scheme, although the plans face legal challenges from charities and campaign groups. The Home Office has said that people who arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel will be among the first group notified that it plans to send them to Rwanda. It added that it expects the first flights to take place in the coming months. In a statement, the home secretary, Priti Patel, said: “Britain’s asylum system is broken as criminals exploit and smuggle people into our country at huge costs to UK taxpayers. “The world-leading migration partnership with Rwanda means those making dangerous, unnecessary and illegal journeys to the UK may be relocated to Rwanda to have their claims for asylum considered and to rebuild their lives there, helping break the people-smugglers’ business model and prevent loss of life. “This is just the first stage of the process and we know it will take time as some will seek to frustrate the process and delay removals. I will not be deterred from acting to deliver on the changes the British people voted for to take back control of our money, laws and borders.” Last week saw the first legal action against the scheme get under way. The challenge, brought by law firm InstaLaw, states that the proposals run contrary to international law and the UN refugee convention, as well as breaching British data protection law. The case focuses on an Iranian asylum seeker who believes he would face an extremely difficult time if sent to Rwanda. On Friday, a speech by Patel at a Conservative party dinner was disrupted by a group of pro-refugee campaigners. Shortly after Patel began to speak, eight activists from the Green New Deal Rising stood up one by one and called on her to drop the scheme, calling it “racist” and “inhumane”. Responding to Monday’s announcement, Enver Solomon, CEO of the Refugee Council, said: “The government’s desire to treat people as human cargo and expel them to Rwanda is not only cruel, nasty and unprincipled, but it is also completely unworkable and lacking key details. Given this, it isn’t surprising it is facing legal challenges. “Rather than pushing ahead with a harmful policy that destroys our reputation as a country which values human rights, this government must focus on operating an orderly, humane and fair asylum system, and developing safe routes such as humanitarian visas.” Tim Naor Hilton, chief executive of Refugee Action, called the plans a “get-tough-quick” scheme that ignored “that refugees risk their lives to come to the UK for the things that make all of us feel safer, such as family, friends, community and language”. “Priti Patel herself has acknowledged that a lack of safe routes pushes people into the hands of smugglers, yet she refuses to expand existing schemes or create new ones,” he said. “Ministers must ditch their hostile policies and create more routes to safety for people fleeing war and persecution, such as expanded family reunion and a long-term refugee resettlement programme that welcomes at least 10,000 people a year.”",News/UK news,First refugees to be told this week of their relocation to Rwanda,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/09/first-refugees-to-be-toldd-this-week-of-their-relocation-to-rwanda
5/10/2022,"Rugby chiefs are poised to hold key discussions on Tuesday over the proposal to radically shake up the international calendar and introduce a new global competition to be staged every two years. Representatives from the Six Nations, Sanzaar (South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina Rugby) and World Rugby are poised to meet for crucial talks in Dublin over a biennial north v south competition, which would fully launch in 2026. It would be the sport’s biggest overhaul since the dawn of professionalism in 1995. The competition, which would not be played in World Cup or British & Irish Lions years, is a revamp of the Nations Championship which was proposed in 2019. While that was doomed to failure, a well-placed source said the latest format has been “broadly agreed by all parties”, including the players. In 2019 there was significant opposition from the players’ union amid welfare concerns, and while there are hurdles to be overcome, there is optimism progress will be made this week. The competition would involve the Six Nations – England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales – in the north while Australia, Argentina, Fiji, New Zealand and South Africa would be joined in the south by Japan, even though it is in the northern hemisphere. European teams would play three matches on their summer tours against three different opponents and face the remaining three southern nations at home in November. The top two in each pool would meet each other in a fourth week in November and it is understood there is some support for a finals day involving all teams, rather than a single fixture between the top two sides. Remaining stumbling blocks include the fact that there are only three official Test weeks in November at present – a finals day would require four and need agreements over player release with the French and English clubs. Insiders believe, however, that because of greater ongoing collaboration with the clubs there is likely to be less opposition from the Premiership and the Top 14 than three years ago. Other issues to be ironed are believed to be over revenue sharing, while it does not help that the Rugby Football Union chief executive, Bill Sweeney, will be absent from Dublin, after a recent pulmonary embolism, given his role in formulating the proposal to date. There are also concerns in some quarters over promotion and relegation from the competition with a second-tier tournament including nations such as the USA, Tonga, Samoa and Georgia also set to be introduced, possibly from 2024. It had initially been hoped that the top tier league would also launch in 2024 but, as previously revealed by the Guardian, that had come to been seen as overly optimistic. One of the major fears over the new tournament is that it would mean fewer matches between established and developing nations but it is believed that is not considered something that will torpedo the proposal. Equally significant is that both the Six Nations and the Rugby Championship would remain unaffected, removing the thorny issue of promotion and relegation being introduced to the former.",Sport/Sport,Rugby powers to hold talks on new global north v south tournament,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/09/rugby-powers-talks-new-global-north-v-south-tournament
5/10/2022,"People suffering from long Covid have reacted with alarm to comments by government’s equalities watchdog that the condition should not be treated as a disability. Under the Equalities Act, anyone with a physical or mental impairment that has lasted for longer than 12 months and substantially impacted their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities qualifies as disabled and is entitled to protection to ensure that they aren’t discriminated against in the workplace. This includes requesting that their employer makes “reasonable adjustments”, such as flexible working hours or home working, to ensure that they can continue working. In a tweet posted on Sunday night, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which was set up to promote and enforce equality and non-discrimination laws said: “Discussions continue on whether ‘long Covid’ symptoms constitute a disability. Without case law or scientific consensus, EHRC does not recommend that ‘long Covid’ be treated as a disability.” The statement prompted immediate concern and confusion from long Covid support groups and unions. Alice Arkwright, policy and campaigns support officer for the TUC, said: “We are concerned that this tweet may give licence to employers to not provide those reasonable adjustments, when actually, there is a very clear definition of who is disabled under the Equalities Act.” Dr Jenny Ceolta-Smith, an employment advocate for Long Covid Support and co-founder of Occupational Therapy for Long Covid, said: “There is already disbelief of workers’ long Covid symptoms within the workplace, and this harmful announcement by the EHRC may make it much harder for workers to gain the support that they need from colleagues and line managers. It may even mean more jobs are lost.” According to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), an estimated 1.7 million people in the UK (2.7% of the population) were experiencing long Covid symptoms lasting longer than four weeks as of 5 March 2022. Of these, 784,000 said they’d been affected for longer than a year, and 74,000 had been experiencing symptoms for at least two years. Of those affected, 322,000 reported that their ability to undertake their day-to-day activities had been “limited a lot”. Within this group, there will almost certainly be people who would qualify as disabled. However, “It’s not like a lottery ticket; just because you say something could be considered as a disability, it doesn’t automatically get people blue badges and benefits,” said Lesley Macniven, an HR consultant and founder of Long Covid Work, which supports long Covid sufferers with workplace issues. “All it does is put a little bit more pressure on employers to make sure they try and help that person. People that we support want to get back to work, they want to stay in work, and be able to pay the bills and keep a roof over their head.” Catherine Hale, founder and director of Chronic Illness Inclusion, which advocates for people with chronic illness and energy-limiting conditions, said being able to access reasonable adjustments was critical to people staying in work. “They should be able to confidently go to their employer and have those conversations,” she said. A spokesperson for the EHRC said: “We would recommend that employers continue to follow existing guidance when considering reasonable adjustments for disabled people and access to flexible working, based on the circumstances of individual cases. “Given that long Covid is not among the conditions listed in the Equality Act as ones which are automatically a disability, such as cancer, HIV and multiple sclerosis, we cannot say that all cases will fall under the definition of disability. “This does not affect whether ‘long Covid’ might amount to a disability for any particular individual. This will be determined by the employment tribunal or court considering any claim of disability discrimination.” However, Arkwright said asking someone suffering from Covid-associated fatigue to take their employer to a tribunal if they felt they’d been discriminated against was unreasonable. “The TUC is asking for the government to automatically treat long Covid as a disability so that people wouldn’t have to go through this process,” she said.",News/Society,Alarm after EHRC says long Covid should not be treated as disability,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/09/alarm-after-ehrc-says-long-covid-should-not-be-treated-as-disability
5/10/2022,"Authorities in Nevada have recovered another set of human remains from Lake Mead as a devastating drought has depleted the massive reservoir outside Las Vegas. Two sisters paddle boarding in the lake on Saturday spotted the bones, which they initially thought were the remains of a bighorn sheep. “For the longest time I was in disbelief, like I did not think that we actually found human remains,” Lynette Melvin told KLAS-TV. After spotting a jaw bone, they realized the remains were human and contacted park officials. National Park Service rangers collected them from Callville Bay, part of an area that is popular for boating and other water recreation. Las Vegas police said they are not investigating the case as a homicide. The Clark county coroner’s office is examining the remains as officials try to determine the identity. The discovery came a week after dwindling lake levels unearthed a barrel containing the body of a man who authorities said had been shot decades ago. Police estimate the man was probably killed between the mid-1970s and the early 1980s because he was wearing shoes made in that period. The Clark county coroner’s office is also trying to determine that person’s identity. Police said they planned to enlist experts at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas to determine when the barrel started eroding. The grueling drought that has battered the American west has depleted the lake, one of the largest reservoirs in the US, so much that a water intake became visible two weeks ago. Las Vegas is now pumping water from deeper within the reservoir, which is part of a system that provides water to more than 40 million people and agriculture across the region. Officials have warned that the drought would probably bring more human remains to the lake’s surface. “I would say there is a very good chance as the water level drops that we are going to find additional human remains,” Ray Spencer, a lieutenant with the Las Vegas police, said after the discovery of the first set of remains.

5/10/2022,"For Boris Johnson, the safe place was a fridge. A space to chill out and hide away from unfriendly members of the media – reporters who couldn’t be relied on to treat his every dishonesty with grotesque indulgence. Keir Starmer was rather bolder than that. He chose to give a mini press conference to the three main broadcasters, none of whom held back from asking the difficult questions. There again, the Labour leader probably had no choice. To have said nothing was to have played into No 10’s hands, making Starmer look defensive and shifty. Hell, it had even reached the point where some of Downing Street’s more servile hacks were writing stories about parties Keir had considered having and then reconsidered when the regulations changed. We’re now on to thoughtcrimes. Hold the front page. Next we’ll be hearing about how Starmer once thought about going through an amber light before thinking better of it. Far better for him to go down fighting. It wasn’t ideal, mind. In hindsight, Starmer probably wishes he’d never had that beer or bought a curry for his staff. Let the bastards starve next time. But what’s done is done and he’d have to live with the consequences. So shortly after four in the afternoon, the Labour leader chose to launch his own counteroffensive to nearly two weeks of “Beergate” headlines orchestrated by No 10 and the rightwing tabloid press. Starmer began by reminding everyone of the sacrifices people had made during lockdown. The people they couldn’t see or even say goodbye to. He knew how that felt; he hadn’t been able to attend his mother-in-law’s funeral. The country had a right to expect their politicians to obey the same rules, so the idea that he had broken any rules was just absurd. What’s more, he didn’t believe that even Johnson really believed he, Starmer, had broken any rules. Almost certainly true, that. The Convict wouldn’t recognise any rule-breaking even if he was to walk in on No 10 staffers doing lines of coke in the toilets. One beer in Durham wouldn’t even begin to register on his conscience. If he had one. All that Boris really wanted was to drag everyone down to his level in the public’s mind. A morally relativistic race to the bottom. So that when he inevitably received further fixed-penalty notices for the Abba party in No 10 and the “bring your own booze” bash in the Downing Street garden that had gone on for hours and ended with the empties and the staffers getting mopped up from the flowerbeds, he could spin the narrative that all politicians were the same. Beergate was no different from getting trashed at a karaoke night the day before the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral. But Starmer did want to draw a line between him and Johnson. If he was fined, he would resign. Promising to resign is never the best of looks – you don’t want to give people ideas – but Keir was calm and dignified throughout. This may not have been the presser he wanted to give, but he conducted it with integrity. Something that may not matter to some Tories or the Convict – anyone who thinks Starmer’s promise to walk in any way makes it more likely that Johnson will rethink his decision not to resign hasn’t been paying attention – but it does to Starmer. He’s old-fashioned that way. He won’t have to be dragged kicking and screaming away from his position as party leader. He won’t stoop to lies to brazen things out. If it turns out he’s made a mistake, he’ll take the rap. Unlike the Convict, who has never taken responsibility for anything. Not even his children. And maybe the less myopic would see in him the possibility of what a leader could look like. Not a pallid-faced narcissist with a toddler haircut whose only sincere belief is in his own exceptionalism. There were inevitably a few lacunae in Starmer’s narrative that the media were quick to pounce upon. Hadn’t he only promised to do what he was always going to have to do anyway if he was fined? Yup, but he’d done it with style and taken hold of the storyline. Already some Tory MPs who had previously called for his resignation were getting a bollocking from Conservative central office. They hadn’t been quite bright enough to see where this one logically concluded. Step forward the ever loyal, ever half-witted Micky Fab. But hadn’t Starmer also called for Johnson to resign when he had only been under police investigation? Much the same as he was now. Here the Labour leader wriggled uncomfortably. Because he was buggered if he was going to serve his own head up on a plate. That would be to play into the Convict’s hands. Months and months of Labour infighting while Johnson took the FPNs and inflation into double figures. So if it was all the same, he could live with a bit of hypocrisy. Just not the full-blooded corruption within No 10. So he was going to rewrite this one. He’d stay, if it was all the same. Not least because he had done nothing wrong. Unlike Johnson. Almost as an afterthought, Sky’s Beth Rigby shouted out a question to the retreating Starmer. To his credit, he turned to answer it. What would he do if the Durham constabulary said he’d committed a minor breach, as with Dominic Cummings’ eyesight test, but chose not to fine him? That wasn’t going to happen, he said. The penalty for a breach of the law was a fine. If he didn’t get a FPN, which he was sure he wouldn’t, then he was in the clear. Over to the Old Bill. No 10 and the tabloids may have been leaning on the Durham plods for the last fortnight. Now it was his turn. You’ve got to ask yourself one question: do I feel lucky? It seems Starmer does. Or lucky enough. Politics is a messy, dirty business. Things get said that can’t be unsaid. The trick is to style them out. It turns out that honour and integrity aren’t black and white. They are a continuum. And Keir is on the side of the angels with dirty faces. Lord, make me pure. Just not quite yet.",News/Politics,Starmer draws a line as he launches Beergate counteroffensive | John Crace,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/09/starmer-draws-a-line-as-he-launches-beergate-counter-offensive
5/10/2022,"Keir Starmer dramatically pledged to quit if he is fined for breaking lockdown rules, as Labour prepared to present police with a dossier of evidence to show his team worked beyond 1am on the night he was pictured drinking a beer. The Guardian can reveal that Labour has compiled time-stamped logs of WhatsApp chats, documents and video edits – which it will provide to the investigation by Durham police. The party claims it proves the curry and beers shared between his team came as part of a long working day preparing for the Hartlepool byelection, meaning it was permitted under Covid rules at the time. In a speech on Monday after hours of deliberating with his aides, Starmer took the gamble of his career by saying he would resign if police issued him with a fixed-penalty notice for what happened on April 30 last year. His deputy, Angela Rayner, who was also at Durham Miners Hall, also said she would resign if penalised. Starmer said he was determined to prove he had “different principles to the prime minister”, who has already been given a fixed-penalty notice for breaching lockdown rules in Downing Street. He said he was confident he had not broken the rules but would resign if fined, saying: “The British public deserve politicians who think the rules apply to them.” Detectives investigating the circumstances of the takeaway curry are considering interviewing the Labour leader face to face, the Guardian understands. Durham’s police’s investigation is set to carry on at least until June, and any of the at least 15 people present could face a penalty if deemed to have broken laws by detectives. Starmer is said to be confident he will not be fined because of the evidence that the takeaway was part of his working day, though a leaked memo showed the order was pre-planned at the end of a Zoom quiz organised by the local MP. In messages seen by the Guardian, at least two senior aides who were present at Durham Miners Hall sent queries about script edits and video editing between 10.30pm and 1am after the takeaway was ordered for the campaign team, which included Starmer, Rayner and the Labour MP Mary Foy. Labour sources said they would insist Starmer had not broken the rules regardless of whether work continued after the meal – but said the evidence added weight to Starmer’s case and gave them the confidence he would not have to resign. A party source said: “We have been totally clear that no rules were broken. We will provide documentary evidence that people were working before and after stopping to have food.” Starmer and his team will provide police with evidence from WhatsApp groups, including one set up for the visit, where tweets, scripts and video edits were being discussed until the early hours. In a speech on Monday, Starmer said he had “simply had something to eat whilst working late in the evening, as any politician would do days before an election.” Not all participants in the WhatsApp group were at the hall – and Starmer is not a member of either group – but one message the following day says, “Keir woke up this morning with some queries about the video.” A source said Starmer was given overnight briefing papers to work through for the following day’s visit. The Labour leader filmed a video in the hall with timestamps on the video showing filming took place until 9.07pm – and WhatsApp messages then show aides corresponding about the edits. In a message at 10.52pm, an aide says they are “only just editing” a message for International Workers’ Day and warns they “won’t have something through for an hour or two”. They also say a script for Starmer’s visit to Liberty Steel in Hartlepool still needs to be completed. Labour will also show police edits made to a Google document containing a script for a clip that Starmer would film at Liberty Steel, which show changes being made from 10.41pm until 11.19pm. One WhatsApp message with the final edit – from an aide who was with Starmer – sends the final edit at 1.56am with the message “Sorry it’s so late”. The messages do not make it clear whether aides remained in the venue until that time or whether they returned to work at their hotel. Starmer’s decision to announce he would resign if the police found he had broken the rules was criticised by some Conservative MPs as putting unnecessary pressure on Durham police. The minister Chris Philp suggested Stamer could be “attempting to pressure the police into clearing him”, describing the move as “deeply inappropriate”. Tory MPs had previously been warned by whips to stop short of calling for Starmer’s resignation because of the pressure it could put on Johnson. Starmer said it had been entirely his decision, as rumours circulated among Labour MPs that he had faced calls to make the declaration from members of his shadow cabinet. “This is my decision about what is the right thing to do in these circumstances,” he said. “This is about me. It’s about what I believe in in politics. It’s about integrity, and I believe in integrity, and integrity requires me to take the course of action I have set out if, in the event, I get a fixed-penalty notice.” Earlier on Monday Starmer pulled out of a speech at the Institute for Government as he wrestled with how to respond to the renewed pressure on him over the conduct at the gathering in Durham of Labour aides, some of whom were reported to have been drunk – which was denied by Foy. Starmer has a loophole where he could potentially be criticised by the police but not fined – an approach the Durham force took after an inquiry into alleged lockdown breaches by Dominic Cummings, who was then the prime minister’s senior aide. Answering questions from the media, Starmer indicated that he would not necessarily step down if police did not fine him yet said the event may have breached rules. “The penalty for a Covid breach is a fixed-penalty notice,” he said when asked about that situation. “That’s a matter of law. And I’ve set out what the position is in relation to that.”",News/Politics,Labour says it can prove Starmer’s team worked past 1am on Beergate night,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/09/labour-says-can-prove-starmer-team-worked-past-1am-beergate-night
5/10/2022,"Female performers in British variety acts have long been termed “showgirls”. For the illusionist Marisa Carnesky, this demeans them. “What happens when the showgirl grows up?” she asks. A performance artist and creator of the interactive show Ghost Train – which was in residence at Blackpool for five years – Carnesky is using first-hand testimony, archival research and a healthy dose of guesswork to conjure the world of late 19th and early 20th-century female circus performers. The lives explored in her new production, Showwomen, include those of a sword climber, a clown, an aerialist and a daredevil. “The British seaside was always this extraordinary melting pot,” Carnesky says with glee. “Women weren’t just mute leg-kickers in a lineup.” First: the women who work with swords. Making the show with Carnesky is sword swallower Livia Kojo Alour, who was naturally drawn to the story of the sword artist, crocodile charmer and glass-walker Koringa. Working in the 1930s, Koringa was rumoured to hypnotise farm animals on enemy lines so soldiers could cross unnoticed. “There’s this picture where Koringa climbs up a high ladder of swords,” Kojo Alour says. “I do the same. I have a ladder of swords. I swallow swords; I lay on beds of nails.” She moves her hands as she speaks, occasionally flashing an intricate tattoo of a sword from elbow to wrist. In pictures, Koringa has dark skin, but it is uncertain whether she was an Indian performer, as touted by the Bertram Mills Circus posters, or whether she was encouraged to lean on a racist British fascination for the “exotic”. This is a term Kojo Alour has had to deal with often. “When I was starting out, I had a hard time. I was one of the very few Black performers on the London scene. I was constantly searching for something that made me stand out, and not in an exotic way, which is how I was described a lot back in the day.” She was drawn to extremities in performance. “The only way to carve my way was to do something dangerous that nobody else could do.” Another of the show’s main characters is the pioneering 1930s clown Lulu Adams. Her act would have felt something akin to drag kinging, Carnesky suggests, as clowning was only done by men. Carnesky and Kojo Alour will also be performing with the self-taught hair hanger Fancy Chance, who will explore the 1880s aerialist Miss La La, whom Degas painted hanging from her teeth. In some shows, they will be joined by the fire artist Lucifire, who will look into the life of the 1920s stuntwoman and Wall of Death rider Marjorie Dare. Throughout her research, Carnesky has been supported by Prof Vanessa Toulmin, director of the National Fairground and Circus Archive, whom Carnesky refers to reverentially. But even with this expert knowledge, so much detail of these performers’ lives remains unknown. “Did they know each other?” Carnesky wonders of Lulu Adams and Koringa, who at one point worked in the same circus. “Were they friends? When something went wrong, did they stay with each other?” In order to piece together a better idea of what the pioneering performers’ lives might have looked like, she has been speaking to some of their contemporaries. “I want to create a tapestry of retired performers,” she explains, “to bring these women back to life.” The next two interviews she has lined up are with a 93-year-old foot juggler and a member of a historic family of Romany clairvoyants. She has also been uncovering glimpses of the past through the Posh Club, a social club for “swanky senior citizens” run by the performance art collective Duckie. Just before the pandemic, Carnesky gave a lecture about her collated circus troupe, and was greeted at the end by a dapperly dressed gentleman in his 90s. He wore a pentagram, a sign of the occult. “I knew her,” the man said, “Koringa. I was a stuntman and she was quite a girl.” He asked Carnesky to come back for lunch, but almost immediately the pandemic hit. “By the time lockdown was over,” she says, “he had died.” She found his obituary: Count Harvey, circus showman, escapologist and wiccan high priest. Whatever he knew of Koringa, it will remain unshared. The elusiveness is part of what makes all this so exciting. Kojo Alour draws on this as she describes the thrill of the life-threatening performances that she and Koringa have made their living from, nearly a hundred years apart. “Learning these skills is a secret,” she says. “It’s almost impossible to find a teacher for sword-swallowing, so these secrets remain in the sideshow.” Throughout history, rare skills like these have been overlooked, a fact Carnesky is attempting to counter with a new undergraduate degree in contemporary and popular performance, which champions acts that have emerged from circus and the sideshow. Through Showwomen and the new BA, she wants to elevate these sidelined forms of mass entertainment, “to take away the snobbery and the hierarchy from spectacle”, she says. These skills, and the women who have performed them, deserve their time centre stage. Showwomen is on tour from 17 May to 18 June.",Arts/Stage,‘It’s hard to find a teacher for sword-swallowing’: the thrilling skills of circus showwomen,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/09/its-hard-to-find-a-teacher-for-sword-swallowing-the-thrilling-skills-of-circus-showwomen
5/10/2022,"If you polled the audience at New York’s Ambassador Theater on Saturday night, there’s a good chance many were there to see one person: Pamela Anderson, the 90s icon who’s been having a moment this spring. The Playboy cover model turned Baywatch babe turned tabloid fodder made not only her Broadway but her stage debut last month as Roxie Hart, the canny murderess in Bob Fosse’s burlesque romp Chicago, for an eight-week run in the show’s 25-year strong revival. The stunt casting served as somewhat of a tacit rejoinder to renewed attention on Anderson’s marriage to Motley Crue dummer Tommy Lee, and the sex tape marketed without their permission, brought on by the Hulu show Pam & Tommy. The eight-part limited series, released in March, stars Lily James as Anderson (wearing prosthetic breasts) and Sebastian Stan as Lee and reimagines the theft of their sex tape as gonzo pop culture history, complete with an animatronic penis and an in-vogue feminist revision of Anderson’s public shaming. Anderson did not participate in the series, nor did she lend her support to its portrayal of what by all accounts was a traumatic violation of her privacy. There’s been much press about the show’s queasy (in my view) lack of consent and our collective interest in redeeming shamed women; sources have expressed her discontent, but Anderson has said nothing. Instead, she has returned to the spotlight for work, bending the redemption narrative arc her way. (Ticket sales jumped 9% during her first week.) Chicago has a long history of stunt casting, and for good reason. The role of Roxie Hart – a woman who shoots her lover and tries to leverage her status as a celebrity criminal – can accommodate such Broadway interlopers as Ashlee Simpson, Brooke Shields and the Real Housewives’ Erika Jayne because it is fundamentally about misunderstood striving. Outside celebrity context only adds to the bit. Thus much of Anderson’s greenness – she’s open about learning to sing and dance for the job – can be folded into the role of Roxie, a fame-hungry nobody who dreams of vaudeville stardom. Anderson may not demonstrate great talent for singing (her voice is feathery and soft, at times difficult to hear even in the orchestra) or dancing (good enough), but she has what she needs: an unserious self-awareness and an excellent grasp on winking camp. With her glittery side pout and exaggerated smirks – her face took on the most hyperbolic vaudeville mugs like wax puddy, and I mean that in a good way – Anderson appeared to be both playing the floozy and poking fun at her own image at the same time. Lines such as “I’m older than I ever intended to be” drew laughs, while “I can still have my own act” elicited cheers. The enormous wink she gave while singing “What if the world slandered my name?” could probably be seen from Times Square. (The audience, myself included, laughed.) It helps that Broadway veteran Lana Gordon carries the burden of the show’s singing as star turned murderer Velma Kelly (and also appeared to enjoy sharing the spotlight with Anderson.) Freed up by an excellent cast in a revival that runs like a well-oiled machine, Anderson can afford to simply try her best. She may be new to Broadway but she’s working in familiar territory here – fluttering eyelids, ruby reds lips, a bustier that accentuates the contrast between her most famous assets and her tiny waist. Her Roxie Hart is a temptress, but one that’s putting on the show with a knowing eye toward the challenges of reputation and scandal, the balance of exploiting oneself and potential opportunities. “The story and my life are so parallel,” she told Vogue in March, while in rehearsals. “I always say … 30 years of therapy or just one Broadway show, then I’ll be fine.” Since Pam & Tommy’s release, Anderson has promised to tell “the real story” of her life in a forthcoming memoir and authorized Netflix documentary. Until then, perhaps the best way to subvert what Vulture critic Kathryn VanArendonk called “the limits of the women’s redemption plot” is not to make a point about it, but to simply have a good time. In Chicago, Anderson seems to be doing that before an audience rooting for her – and thus we had fun, too.",Arts/Stage,Razzle dazzle: Pamela Anderson takes back the narrative in Chicago,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/09/pamela-anderson-chicago-broadway-roxie-hart
5/10/2022,"Listen carefully and you may hear one of 60 pubs across the UK and Ireland playing anthems by the Beautiful South on Monday night. The venues have been selected by northern music legend Paul Heaton in honour of his 60th birthday, and by way of celebration he has put £1,000 behind the bar at each one. The former Housemartins and Beautiful South frontman used his Facebook page to invite fans to celebrate with him, explaining that his original tour plan involving cycling between venues around the UK had to be shelved after the pandemic caused delays to the recording of his new album. “The next best way to celebrate this coming of age is to hand-pick 60 pubs across the UK and Ireland and put a given amount of money behind the bar of each one,” he said. To celebrate my 60th birthday (on Monday 9th May) I’d originally intended to do another bicycle tour, visiting & performing at 60 pubs across the UK & Ireland. However, due to recording delays caused by the pandemic, I’ve had to shelve these plans for the time being… pic.twitter.com/lB3cJjf06m “The hope is to bring people together on the day, while recognising that many folk who bought my records or showed me support over the years could do with a wee party.” Heaton, who still performs today, shot to fame in the early 1980s with the Hull-based group the Housemartins. They produced two albums and several hit singles including Happy Hour and a cover version of Caravan of Love, which reached No 1 in the UK charts in December 1986. After the band split, he formed the Beautiful South in 1988, releasing 10 studio albums over 17 years. The Briton’s Protection, a central Manchester pub dating from 1750, is one of Heaton’s regular drinking spots. Two hours after opening at lunchtime, the bar manager John Burke couldn’t pull pints fast enough for the fans pouring in, eager to raise a glass to their favourite singer-songwriter. “He loves it here,” Burke said. “He always sits in the same spot when he comes and chats to people.” Grace Leape and Holly Roberts came to grab a drink in the sun after seeing Heaton’s birthday announcement. “We’re big fans, despite not having been old enough to remember lots of his biggest hits being released!” said Leape. “But I’ve been to a few of his gigs with my mum and I love the music.” Angela Lewis, a fellow fan, was wearing a Beautiful South T-shirt and hat as she sat enjoying a glass of wine. “I’ve been to one of his gigs almost every year since 1984,” she said. At the Orion pub in Withington, Phil and Cathy Gordon were reminiscing about the 1986 Housemartins gig they attended in the city. “He’s always seemed like someone who, in addition to being mega-talented, is also a really lovely man. He hasn’t let the fame go to his head,” Phil said. Just down the road at the Albert, the barmaid, Janine Renee, said she had seen quite a few new faces at the bar. “We’ll have to track him down and buy him a drink in return!” said Paul Conaghan as he and his partner Yvonne Clarke enjoyed a “birthday bevvy”. Hundreds of Heaton’s Twitter followers posted pictures of themselves in the pubs. John Richmond tweeted: “Fab idea. I’m sure it’ll make loads of people happy in difficult times,” with another adding: “Your music has brought me happiness and made me think for 30 years.” João Souser, originally from Faro in Portugal, shared fond memories of his brother learning to play Housemartins tunes on the piano when they were growing up. “We had the cassette!” he said. “I still remember the cover.” “The northern English music from that time is so nostalgic for me, and it’s part of the reason I moved to Manchester.” Then, as more people arrived for what looked likely to be the busiest Monday night the pub has seen for a while, Souser surveyed the room and added: “This is a city where music really brings people together, and you can see the proof of that here today.”",Arts/Music,"Grand gesture: musician Paul Heaton puts £1,000 behind bar at 60 pubs",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/09/grand-gesture-musician-paul-heaton-puts-1000-behind-bar-at-60-pubs
5/10/2022,"Keir Starmer has rarely before caused a moment of intense drama in national politics. But his televised statement that he would quit if Durham police issue him with a fine for breaching Covid rules was a highly compelling moment, and an unexpected gamble for someone who colleagues sometimes refer to as “cautious Keir”. It will have serious consequences, whatever the outcome of the investigation. If he is cleared by the police inquiry, he has drawn a moral line in the sand – one which Boris Johnson is on the wrong side of. Contrasting his own conduct with that of the prime minister, Starmer is attempting to pitch himself as a politician that the public can rely on to tell the truth and abide by society’s rules. If he is found by Durham police to have broken the rules and resigns, then he will be proving that the Labour party believes politicians must demonstrate accountability. Once again, the difference will be clear compared with Johnson, who has refused to resign in the face of a police Covid fine. Johnson is still facing the prospect of potential further fines from the police. And if the prime minister was to continue to refuse to stand down despite more penalties, when Starmer had already done so for more minor breaches of rules that he did not make, then the prime minister’s position would look increasingly untenable. The clear calculation behind Starmer’s statement is that this high-stakes move makes him look bold and will win him praise for being decisive – two qualities he is not best known for. Some supporters of the move also believe it would have been impossible for him to do anything else when Labour MPs were being asked daily questions about his position, distracting from their focus on the prime minister’s misbehaviour. However, there is a counterargument. Some Labour insiders were incredulous that he would even talk of resigning before it became necessary, worrying that it would cause people to start writing him off too early. There are also concerns that it leaves Starmer in a difficult position if Durham police fudge their findings, as they did with former No 10 aide Dominic Cummings. If they issue a statement saying he may have broken the rules, but it is too historic to issue a fine, then Starmer will come under pressure to abide by the spirit of his statement. In the event that Starmer’s gamble backfires, ending in his resignation, it is not clear who else will benefit. Starmer’s strongest supporters will be devastated to see the departure of someone they believe was rebuilding Labour’s support after a catastrophic 2019 election result and dealing with the antisemitism problem that had dogged the party. But others in Labour will be pleased: both those wishing for a more charismatic leader – perhaps Wes Streeting or Lisa Nandy – and those who resent his decision to move Labour’s policies away from the Corbyn era. Equally, several Tory MPs said on Monday that they felt No 10 and Conservative party headquarters should be careful what they wished for. They would claim a scalp if Starmer were to go, but some Conservatives said they were fearful he could be replaced by someone punchier, with even further distance from Corbyn’s tenure. The move would also only serve to pile pressure on Johnson to take a similar course, though he is far from susceptible to feeling the need to emulate others in doing the right thing. Starmer’s team clearly believe this is an unlikely outcome, and are presenting evidence to Durham police that they say will prove he and his team did nothing wrong. The force now knows the fate of the Labour leader and his deputy is in its hands, which may make officers think twice before issuing either of them with a fine. So far, all the political pressure has come from a handful of Tory MPs and the Daily Mail demanding that they act. With the potential for further fines for Johnson in the coming days, and more clear-cut evidence of partying in No 10 than took place in Durham, the heat is still on the prime minister – for now.",News/Politics,Keir Starmer’s moment of drama is an unexpected gamble,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/09/keir-starmer-gamble-resignation-labour
