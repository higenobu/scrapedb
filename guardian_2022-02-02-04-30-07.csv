2/2/2022,"Hannah Lowe, a former London teacher, has won the £30,000 Costa book of the year for The Kids, a book of sonnets drawing on her experiences teaching in an inner-city sixth form. After what judges called “a long and passionate discussion”, Lowe’s poetry collection beat the bookies’ favourite, Claire Fuller’s novel Unsettled Ground, to the Costa award for the year’s “most enjoyable” book. The prize pits the winners of five categories – first novel, novel, biography, poetry and children’s book – against each other, with Lowe also emerging ahead of Caleb Azumah Nelson’s debut novel Open Water, John Preston’s biography of Robert Maxwell, Fall, and Manjeet Mann’s young adult verse novel The Crossing.  Judges said The Kids was “a book to fall in love with”. “It’s joyous, it’s warm and it’s completely universal,” said chair of judges, the BBC News journalist and broadcaster Reeta Chakrabarti. “It’s crafted and skilful but also accessible. Words from the judges were ‘insightful’, ‘empathetic’, ‘generous’, ‘funny’, ‘compassionate’, ‘uplifting’.” Chakrabarti said it took judges “several hours” to come to their decision. “It was a vigorous debate, it was passionate, people felt really strongly. But the centre of gravity in the room was with the winner,” she said. “We were looking for the most enjoyable book, the most accessible book, the book that you would most want to pass on to other people. And the winner was, for all of us, fresh and immediate, it spoke very directly to everybody. It has a universality to it – in a simple way, because everybody’s been to school.” Some people, Chakrabarti, said “find poetry a little bit intimidating. They think, ‘Gosh, I’m not necessarily going to get on with it.’” But Lowe’s collection “is so direct that actually you feel that you’re being talked to by somebody. And it spans so much, in a very concentrated way. So it’s about everything, it’s about love and grief. It’s about the present and the past. It’s about teaching and being taught. Motherhood, parents, singledom – there’s so much in it. And it’s very witty and very funny at times as well, and in that sense really uplifting.” Lowe’s sonnets move from the decade she spent teaching in a London sixth form in the 2000s, to her own coming of age in the 1980s and 1990s. A collection of fictionalised portraits of the students she taught, it also sees Lowe write about her son, growing up in London today. “Boredom hangs like a low cloud in the classroom. / Each page we read is a step up a mountain / in gluey boots,” Lowe writes, in The Art of Teaching II. “Even the clock-face is pained / and yes, I’m sure now, ticking slower. If gloom / has a sound, it’s the voice of Lerow reading / Frankenstein aloud.” In Try, Try, Try Again, Lowe writes about failing exams, and of how “you rip the notice // open, your keen heart pumping, and find a D / or damn, an E”. In Sonnet for the A Level English Literature and Language Poetry Syllabus, she explores “all summer term reading poems – / down in the mud / of words, wanting / the kids to hear what I heard – / breaking the poems apart, slapping / their parts to the board – ”. The poet, who is also a lecturer at Brunel University, London, was interviewed by current students at City and Islington College, where she previously taught, after winning the poetry award last month. “I began sketching these poems about five years ago after I’d left the sixth form and had a period of reflection where I started to think about what I’d learnt in my time as a teacher, not least from the students I was teaching,” she told them. “I realised I’d learnt so much from the young people that I taught about personal things, and public and political issues to do with feelings of belonging, a sense of Britishness or not, social class and gender; and I started to think about how they had impacted my own sense of identity.” According to the Costa poetry judges, who selected it as winner of that award, The Kids “buzzes with life while re-energising the sonnet that Shakespeare would recognise”. Lowe, who was born in Ilford to an English mother and Jamaican-Chinese father, was shortlisted for the Forward prizes for her first collection, Chick, in 2013. The Kids, her third, was also shortlisted for the 2021 TS Eliot prize for poetry. It marks the second win in five years for publisher Bloodaxe Books, which also took the top Costa prize in 2017 for Helen Dunmore’s posthumous collection Inside the Wave. The book of the year award has been won 13 times by a novel, five times by a first novel, eight times by a biography, nine times by a collection of poetry and twice by a children’s book, with last year’s prize going to Monique Roffey’s novel The Mermaid of Black Conch.",Arts/Books,‘Uplifting’ book of sonnets by Hannah Lowe wins Costa book of the year,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/01/uplifting-book-of-sonnets-by-hannah-lowe-wins-costa-book-of-the-year
2/2/2022,"Two ancient warrior helmets, metal fragments believed to have come from weapons, and the remains of a temple have been discovered at Velia, an archaeological site in southern Italy that was once a powerful Greek colony. Experts believe the helmets, which were found in good condition, and metal fragments date to the sixth-century BC Battle of Alalia, when a Greek force of Phocaean ships clinched victory over the Etruscans and their Carthaginian allies in a naval battle off the coast of Corsica. One of the helmets is thought to have been taken from the enemies.  The excavations at Velia, which is near Paestum, the vast archaeological park of ancient Greek ruins in the southern Campania region, also yielded the remains of walls of a temple and vases with the Greek inscription “sacred”. The relics were discovered on what would have been the acropolis, or upper part, of the ancient Greek city. Massimo Osanna, the director general of Italian museums, said the site probably contained artefacts of offerings made to Athena, the ancient Greek goddess of wisdom, after the Battle of Alalia. After the battle, the Greek colonists set sail for southern Italy, where they bought a piece of land and founded Velia. Velia formed part of Magna Graecia, which referred to the southern Italian coastal areas colonised by the Greeks. Velia was the birthplace of the distinguished Greek philosopher, Parmenides. Osanna, who previously directed Pompeii archaeological park, said the discoveries “shed fresh light on the history of the powerful Greek colony”, while Dario Franceschini, the culture minister, said the finds highlighted the importance of “continuing to invest in research”. Franceschini last week named Tiziana D’Angelo the new director of Paestum and Velia archaeological park. Aged 28, D’Angelo is among the youngest directors of a leading Italian cultural site. She takes over the role from Gabriel Zuchtriegel, who now manages Pompeii.",News/World news,Archaeologists uncover ancient helmets and temple ruins in southern Italy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/01/archaeologists-uncover-ancient-helmets-and-temple-ruins-in-southern-italy
2/2/2022,"“Those in and around the Kremlin will have nowhere to hide,” the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, told the Commons on Monday, promising new legislation to impose sanctions on those with links to the Russian government should it invade Ukraine. It would be applicable to any company (and its owners) with ties to the Russian state and of economic significance to it – extending well beyond the existing sanctions regime, which covers only those linked to the destabilisation of Ukraine. The Kremlin says that it does not want war, but with more than 100,000 troops near the borders of Ukraine, and more arriving in Belarus, fear is growing of a major land offensive or – as Kyiv suspects – longer-term destabilisation and a continuing hybrid assault using cyber-attacks, sabotage and other means. While diplomacy continues, there is no sign of progress. Vladimir Putin says that Russia’s proposals have been ignored. The US succeeded in forcing a UN security council debate, with Moscow responding by warning that Ukraine may “destroy itself” if it undermines existing peace agreements. On Tuesday, Boris Johnson flew to Kyiv to show support, Monday’s attempt to play international statesman having been hobbled when he had to cancel a phone call with the Russian president to address MPs about the Sue Gray report. Standing next to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, he warned that a Russian invasion would be a disaster.  These matters could hardly be more serious. Yet Ms Truss’s ringing declaration that the UK would get tough on Russian money earned laughter from MPs. “Londongrad” is notorious as a destination and conduit for the assets of the super-rich around Mr Putin, to the frustration of the US and others. The Center for American Progress warned last week that “uprooting Kremlin-linked oligarchs will be a challenge, given the close ties between Russian money and the United Kingdom’s ruling Conservative party, the press, and its real estate and financial industry”. Writing in the Guardian, the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, warned that government inaction on Russian wealth had contributed to Mr Putin’s sense of impunity. Even after the Salisbury poisoning, when the rhetoric sharpened, little changed in reality. There is increasing anger, including among Conservatives, that there is still no sign of the economic crime bill, which would include long-promised measures such as reform of Companies House, a register of properties held by overseas citizens and a public register of beneficial ownership in the British overseas territories. All these are necessary and desirable, and not only with regard to Russia. Legislation, however, is not enough. Unexplained wealth orders have proved much harder to use than had been hoped. It is unclear how widely or well new anti-corruption regulations will be used when there seems to be so little interest in a clean-up at senior political levels. Still less is it clear that targeting Russian money will help protect Ukraine. The optimistic take is that it at least gives those around Mr Putin an incentive to encourage moderation. But London is not the only destination for Russian cash, however convenient and attractive, and Mr Putin is unlikely to feel bound by the priorities of oligarchs who have prospered richly from his reign. The real reason to crack down on tainted money from Moscow and elsewhere is because it is the right thing to do – and should have been done long ago.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Russia: cracking down on tainted money | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/01/the-guardian-view-on-russia-cracking-down-on-tainted-money
2/2/2022,"Is the longest-running political dynasty on Europe’s far right finally running out of road? After her defeat by Emmanuel Macron in the presidential run-off of 2017, Marine Le Pen decided to double down on attempts to detoxify the Front National (FN) movement founded by her father, Jean-Marie, in 1972. The party’s name was changed to the more innocuous-sounding Rassemblement National (National Rally) and its hostility to the European Union and the euro was toned down. During the current election campaign, Ms Le Pen has focused on blue-collar issues and economic nationalism. Having tempered the xenophobic rhetoric and culture-warrior persona, last month she said that she had “definitively broken with provocations” that were “the sins of our political family”. It is generally accepted that this strategy – and this election campaign – represent Ms Le Pen’s last throw of the dice. So far, her numbers are not coming up. In a disastrous beginning to the year, she has endured a number of high-profile defections to the camp of her more extreme rival on the far right, Éric Zemmour. Most damagingly of all, her charismatic niece Marion Maréchal, a former FN MP, last week signalled both her sympathy for Mr Zemmour’s old-school approach and her desire to return to the political stage after a five-year break. Ms Maréchal is far more socially conservative than her aunt, whom she has reportedly not spoken to for some time. In an extraordinary television interview, Ms Le Pen seemed on the point of tears as she described her intervention as “brutal” and “violent”.  As the Libération newspaper put it, referencing the most famous family soap opera of them all, welcome to “Dallas on the extreme right”. Internal bust-ups in the extended Le Pen family have traditionally been of gothic intensity. In 2015, Ms Le Pen was accused of political parricide when she suspended her father from the party that he founded over antisemitic remarks, and stripped him of its honorary presidency. They have since made up. But this bout of family warfare may have more far-reaching consequences. It seems increasingly likely that the curveball candidacy of Mr Zemmour – a pundit provocateur – has as its primary aim the political demise of the Le Pen dynasty. This, he calculates, might allow a unified right to emerge at the election after this one, ending a split going back to the emergence of the FN as a force in the 1980s. Combining extreme social conservatism and Islamophobia with free-market economics, this rebranded movement would be free of toxic association with the Le Pens and – the logic goes – more appealing to the traditionalist right. Ms Maréchal, who has dropped Le Pen from her name, clearly sees the potential; if successful, such a project could break the cordon sanitaire that has kept the far right at bay for 40 years. In a three-way battle on the right to finish second to Mr Macron in April’s first round, Ms Le Pen is more or less tied in the polls with Valérie Pécresse, the centre-right candidate for Les Républicains. Mr Zemmour is a little further behind. But as this week’s drama has illustrated, his ability to damage and drain momentum from Ms Le Pen may be growing. In the context of polls that suggest a country drifting steadily to the right, potentially terminal trouble for the Le Pens is of course welcome. But what comes next may be more extreme and still more insidious in its reach.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Le Pen family firm: reaching the end of the line? | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-le-pen-family-firm-reaching-the-end-of-the-line
2/2/2022,"A Russian invasion of Ukraine would end in a humanitarian, political and military disaster for Russia and the world, Boris Johnson has warned as he stood alongside the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv, saying the UK would be judged by the level of help it gave to Ukraine. On a flying visit to the Ukrainian capital, he denied the US and the UK were exaggerating the scale of the Russian threat, saying they were not trying to “big up” the intelligence. “The grim reality was that Russian troops were massing on Ukraine’s border. This is a clear and present danger,” he said, adding: “the troop concentration was perhaps the biggest demonstration of hostility to Ukraine in our lifetime”, warning it dwarfed the Russian forces mounted before the invasion in 2014.  He said by holding a gun to the head of the Ukrainian people the Russian president was trying to get the west to dismantle the new security architecture set up after the fall of the Berlin Wall. He said the UK was trying to bring the west together, saying this crisis is about something bigger than Ukraine. “He [Putin] is trying to redraw the security map of Europe and to impose a new Yalta, new zones of influence. It would not just be Ukraine that was brought back into the Russian zone of influence. It would be Georgia and Moldova and other countries. This is absolutely critical this moment.” The press conference came after Vladimir Putin, speaking in Moscow, accused the United States of ignoring Russia’s security proposals in his first public comments on the growing crisis over Ukraine since December. A phone call between Boris Johnson and Vladimir Putin that the prime minister was forced to cancel on Monday has been rescheduled for Wednesday, after the Kremlin rejected a request to hold it on Tuesday. The Monday call was cancelled so Johnson could make a statement to MPs in parliament about Downing Street parties during lockdown. Johnson was dogged by questions at the press conference about whether his domestic political crisis over the parties was making it impossible for him to focus on the Russian crisis. He insisted he was fully focused and said he would be talking to Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. His scheduled call with Putin had to be cancelled on Monday as he was forced instead to endure two hours answering questions about the allegations of parties in Downing Street in breach of Covid regulations laid out in the report written by the civil servant Sue Gray. At one point during the press conference he was forced to say that he would publish everything he can of the final version of Gray report. He did not say he would publish everything Gray gives to him. The Ukrainian president largely protected Johnson by refusing to repeat claims that the west was creating panic by hyping an imminent Russian invasion, and instead warned of a great war. Zelenskiy said there were 35,000 to 50,000 Russian troops in Crimea, 35,000 in occupied Donbas, and 100,000 on his country’s international border with Russia. “I’m looking forward to Russia withdrawing its army from our borders. We don’t need words. Just make that one step,” Zelenskiy said, adding Russians didn’t want to die in a war with Ukraine.   Russia  Army: 280,000, including 2,840 tanks and 6,920 fighting vehicles; 150 Iskander ballistic missiles; 4,684+ artillery; 1,520 surface-to-air batteries.  Navy (just the Black Sea fleet): 6 submarines; 6 warships; 35 patrol ships.  Air force: 1,160 combat planes, 394 attack helicopters, 714 air defence systems.

Johnson had said the sanctions would come into force as soon as the first Russian toecap crossed into Ukrainian territory. “It’s vital that in Moscow, they understand that there will be automaticity in the way that we apply these sanctions, so that the minute there is a further incursion into sovereign Ukrainian territory then those sanctions will apply,” Johnson said. “We’re bringing forward the new legislation [that] will enable us to pinpoint … strategic commercial interests of Russia in a very direct way, as well as individual Russian commercial interests.” He added: “There are 200,000 men and women under arms in Ukraine, they will put up a very, very fierce and bloody resistance. I think that parents, mothers in Russia should reflect on that fact.”. In an attempt to put himself at the centre of events he listed the world leaders to whom he has spoken in recent days adding “the people of Ukraine have the inalienable right to choose how they are governed and which organisations they aspire to join”. But he stressed a step back from the brink is still possible, adding that he is ready to engage in dialogue.",News/World news,"Russian invasion of Ukraine would be a disaster, says Boris Johnson in Kyiv",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/01/russian-invasion-of-ukraine-would-be-a-disaster-says-boris-johnson-in-kyiv
2/2/2022,"Lynton Crosby, the Australian campaign guru, will “be around” to give strategic advice to the prime minister without being given a formal job in No 10, according to Tory sources. Boris Johnson buoyed Tory MPs on Monday night by revealing he had rehired the strategist, who helped with the party’s election campaigns in 2015 and 2017. MPs and aides claim they already detect the hand of the “Wizard of Oz” in No 10’s fightback against the partygate scandal.  However, Crosby, who is currently in Australia, will not be taking on an official job that could clash with his business interests and may not spend that much time “physically in the building”, according to sources. Instead, he will be on hand to give more guidance to the prime minister on the reshaping of his operation in No 10 and strategic priorities. Those who know Crosby well say he has made clear that he is an expert on campaigns, not someone who can run a government, but one of his often repeated phrases about political leaders thinking ahead to an election is that you “can’t fatten a pig on market day”. Although many Tories believe Johnson will not still be leader at the next election, MPs say the prime minister himself has not accepted his ejection from office to be a likely option. “Lynton already speaks to him anyway. He has always been his unofficial sounding board. He’s the person he turns to and that conversation has been going on all along,” according to one person who has worked closely with Crosby. Relations between the two men cooled after Crosby helped with Johnson’s leadership campaign in 2019, partly fuelled by tensions over the role of the prime minister’s now-wife Carrie Johnson. But he has come back into the prime minister’s sphere of influence in the last year. One Tory strategist said there was also still hope among the right of the party that Johnson could give a formal chief of staff or parliamentary liaison job to one of Crosby’s strategists, David Canzini, who was involved in the hard Brexit campaigns of Theresa May’s premiership. However, this has been consistently denied by those in No 10. They also said the stream of coordinated announcements over the last few days bore the hallmarks of Crosby and his allies, particularly Johnson’s attempts to bind himself to his rivals for the leadership, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, with a joint op ed and planned trip to Ukraine respectively. As Sue Gray’s report into the partygate scandal dropped on Monday, Johnson had already lined up competing policy statements with his commitment to continuing with the national insurance rise on Sunday, a visit to Ukraine to showcase his international credentials on Tuesday and his long-awaited levelling up white paper on Wednesday. Downing Street sources claimed these were all in the offing for some time and any timing alongside the Gray report was coincidental. Crosby is also renowned for the “dead cat” strategy, where politicians try to change the national conversation from one scandal to another eye-catching talking point, however negative. Although the strategist is not expected to begin his work with No 10 for some weeks, Johnson appeared to have adopted such a distraction tactic in the Commons on Monday, as he made a false claim that Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, failed to prosecute paedophile Jimmy Savile while director of public prosecutions. This then took up air time on Tuesday, even though the prime minister was being heavily criticised from some on his own side over the comments. Alongside Johnson’s effort to renew his focus on policy, he is expected to shake up his team in the days and weeks ahead. Following the Gray report he announced that he would create a new “office of the prime minister” to make No 10 more of an official government department with clearer oversight and accountability. But there are reservations among some of his critics and even some in cabinet that this could actually centralise power for the prime minister. There is also scepticism about his idea of creating backbench “policy boards” to allow Tory MPs to feel heard and that they are contributing. It is understood Graham Brady, the 1922 chair, has a role in putting forward names to chair these boards, but one Tory MP said it was a “tired idea” that many prime ministers reach for when trying to appease their backbenchers. Another senior Conservative MP who believes Johnson should go but has not yet put in a letter said changes to staffing and advice would not help when the prime minister himself is the problem. “What happens when more about the Jennifer Arcuri stuff comes out? What happens when more about the PPE scandal comes out? There will always be another problem.”",News/Politics,‘Wizard of Oz’: Tory MPs cheered by hopes of Lynton Crosby’s return,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/01/tory-mps-cheered-by-hopes-of-lynton-crosby-return
2/2/2022,"Extreme heat in the world’s oceans passed the “point of no return” in 2014 and has become the new normal, according to research. Scientists analysed sea surface temperatures over the last 150 years, which have risen because of global heating. They found that extreme temperatures occurring just 2% of the time a century ago have occurred at least 50% of the time across the global ocean since 2014.  In some hotspots, extreme temperatures occur 90% of the time, severely affecting wildlife. More than 90% of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases is absorbed by the ocean, which plays a critical role in maintaining a stable climate. “By using this measure of extremes, we’ve shown that climate change is not something that is uncertain and may happen in the distant future – it’s something that is a historical fact and has occurred already,” said Kyle Van Houtan, at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, US, and one of the research team. “Extreme climate change is here, it’s in the ocean, and the ocean underpins all life on Earth.” Van Houtan and his colleague Kisei Tanaka are ecologists and began the study because they wanted to assess how heat extremes were related to the loss of kelp forests off the coast of California. “Ecology teaches us that extremes have an outsized impact on ecosystems,” Van Houtan said. “We are trying to understand the dramatic changes that we’ve seen along our coasts and in the ocean, on coral reefs, kelp, white sharks, sea otters, fish, and more.” Other scientists reported in 2019 that the number of heatwaves affecting the planet’s oceans had increased sharply, killing swathes of sea life like “wildfires that take out huge areas of forest”. Van Houtan and Tanaka found no measure of extreme heat existed and so extended their work globally. The study, published in the Plos Climate journal, examined the monthly temperature in each one-degree-by-one-degree part of the ocean and set the highest temperature in the 50-year period as the benchmark for extreme heat. The scientists then examined temperature records from 1920 to 2019, the most recent year available. They found that by 2014, more than 50% of the monthly records across the entire ocean had surpassed the once-in-50–years extreme heat benchmark. The researchers called the year when the percentage passed 50% and did not fall back below it in subsequent years the “point of no return”. By 2019, the proportion of the global ocean suffering extreme heat was 57%. “We expect this to keep on going up,” said Van Houtan. But the extreme heat was particularly severe in some parts of the ocean, with the South Atlantic having passed the point of no return in 1998. “That was 24 years ago – that is astounding,” he said. The proportion of the ocean experiencing extreme heat in some large ecosystems is now 80%-90%, with the five worst affected including areas off the north-east coasts of the US and Canada, off Somalia and Indonesia, and in the Norwegian Sea. “You should care about turtles, seabirds and whales, but even if you don’t, the two most lucrative fisheries in the US, lobster and scallops, are in those exact spots,” said Van Houtan, while 14 fisheries in Alaska have recently been declared federal disasters. The heat content of the top 2,000 metres of the ocean set a new record in 2021, the sixth in a row. Prof John Abraham at the University of St Thomas in Minnesota, one of the team behind the assessment, said ocean heat content was the most relevant to global climate, while surface temperatures were most relevant to weather patterns, as well as many ecosystems. “Oceans are critical to understanding climate change. They cover about 70% of the planet’s surface and absorb more than 90% of global warming heat,” Abraham said. “The new study is helpful because the researchers look at the surface temperatures. It finds there has been a big increase in extreme heat at the ocean’s surface and that the extremes are increasing over time.”",News/Environment,Extreme heat in oceans ‘passed point of no return’ in 2014,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/01/extreme-heat-oceans-passed-point-of-no-return-high-temperatures-wildlife-seas
2/2/2022,"Almost no corals on the planet will escape severe bleaching once global heating reaches 1.5C, according to a new study of the world’s reefs. Reefs in areas currently regarded as cooler refuges will be overwhelmed at 1.5C of heating, and just 0.2% of reefs will escape at least one bleaching outbreak every decade, according to the research.  The team of scientists from the University of Leeds, Texas Tech University and James Cook University used the latest climate model projections to confirm that 1.5C of global heating “will be catastrophic for coral reefs”. Corals bleach when ocean temperatures are too high for too long. Algae that provide corals with much of their food and colour separate from the coral during heat stress. Severe bleaching can kill corals, but they can recover from milder outbreaks if there are several years with no further heatwaves. The world’s oceans are heating due mostly to the burning of fossil fuels. The study comes as the world’s biggest coral reef system, the Great Barrier Reef off Australia’s Queensland coast, is on the verge of another mass coral bleaching event. In the study, the team analysed climate projections across all of the world’s shallow-water coral reefs, which constitute the vast majority of reefs and provide habitat, tourism revenue and coastal protection. About 84% of the world’s corals exist in areas that are expected to bleach less than once a decade and are regarded as “thermal refugia”, the study said. But the analysis suggests at 1.5C of global heating, only 0.2% of the area covered by reefs is in water cool enough to avoid bleaching at least once every five years – a frequency considered too short to allow corals to recover. The only area to escape, the study claims, would be in a region of the east Indian Ocean in an area of natural upwelling of cooler water. Even areas with strong currents that can protect corals from heat, such as those in Panama, Florida and the Lesser Sunda Islands in Indonesia, would be overwhelmed by the heat. Associate Prof Scott Heron, a marine scientist at James Cook University and a co-author of the study, said coral reefs sustained a billion people around the world. He said the study, published in the journal PLOS Climate, showed corals worldwide were at even greater risk from climate change than previously thought. That meant it was crucial that conservation work continued on reefs to give corals a fighting chance of survival, he said. “Until we reach the point where I can’t see a single coral, it isn’t too late. “We have to keep pursuing our best practices to protect coral reefs. Real people rely on these reefs and that is a driver to keep gathering the best knowledge possible.” Adele Dixon, lead author of the study and a PhD student at the University of Leeds, said corals in French Polynesia and southern Indonesia may be exposed to heat stress less frequently, and the study did identify a small number of “hope sites”. “Corals in these locations, such as the eastern Pacific, may be better able to cope with temperature extremes,” she said. But one prominent coral reef expert challenged the findings, and doubted the real world outcomes would be as catastrophic as the research suggests. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Prof Peter Mumby, a reef expert at the University of Queensland studying the effects of climate change on corals, agreed that at 1.5C corals worldwide would be under greater stress than they are today. “But I don’t agree that this research provides evidence that corals are untenable under 1.5C of warming,” he said. Mumby said the levels of heat stress used in the study to identify severe bleaching were arguably too low, and the method was unlikely to capture local conditions that could protect some reefs. Even reefs that are hit by bleaching every five years could include areas of coral that would survive, he said.",News/Environment,"All coral will suffer severe bleaching when global heating hits 1.5C, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/01/all-coral-will-suffer-severe-bleaching-when-global-heating-hits-15c-study-finds
2/2/2022,"Here’s the thing. You won’t find any sentient being who will tell you anything other than that Boris Johnson was a total disaster during his Commons statement on the Sue Gray report on Monday. Narcissistic, tin-eared, deceitful and graceless would be some of the kinder descriptions of his behaviour. And yet. Little more than an hour later, Big Dog was locked in a committee room in Portcullis House with almost the entire Tory parliamentary party, giving the performance of his life. At least that’s how those backbenchers – surrounded by ministers and party whips – who were present, chose to report it. MPs who had gone into the room as sceptics left an hour later totally charmed. Clearly you had to have been there to fully appreciate his killer reference to himself as Othello. Though hopefully someone later explained to him and Carrie what happened to Desdemona. The Suspect clearly has a lot of work to do before starting on his Shakespeare biography. Like reading some of the plays.  Then it’s uncanny that it always seems to be that way. One way or another, Johnson saves his best efforts for when there is no reliable audience. Just a few tame stooges who are easily bullied. Perhaps it’s stage fright. If only he could reproduce his star quality on the big stage, then we might all appreciate his exceptionalism. His genius. Think how frustrating it must be for Big Dog to realise how few of his best lines reach the general public and that all most people know of him is that he’s a shit liar. Think also how frustrating it must be for The Suspect to have to rely on other halfwits to spread his talent on the news channels. People like Nadine Dorries, who spit and snarl conspiracy theories into any passing microphone, safe in the knowledge she’ll never hold a cabinet post again. People like Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has never knowingly been right about anything. People like Paul Scully, who will be suffering from PTSD for years following his mauling at the hands of Emma Barnett on Newsnight. People like Dominic Raab. Come Tuesday morning, it was the justice secretary and deputy prime minister who had drawn the short straw of trying to explain why The Suspect had done nothing wrong even though Number 10 was the subject of 12 separate police investigations. It didn’t go well. Long before the end of the final interview, Dom’s anger vein was pumping wildly with psychotic rage. It would be at least another three murder day for him. He just had to hope the bodies weren’t recovered from the Thames for some weeks. So what was the prime minister sorry for, Nick Robinson asked on Radio 4’s Today programme. Raab literally didn’t have a clue. Apart from the obvious about being sorry he had been caught. There again, how could he? Even Big Dog doesn’t know why he’s saying sorry and can’t bring himself to even affect sincerity. He still somehow believes he is the innocent victim in this and that somehow all the parties happened to him. All that Dom could manage for a full seven minutes was an increasing tetchy and terse “no comment” as Robinson tried to find one thing that Johnson might conceivably feel sorry for. Raab just shrugged. He supposed the fault might have lain in the structures of No 10. Perhaps if there had been a proper office for the prime minister then someone in the building might have noticed that endless parties with everyone getting pissed was not a good look. But, as it was, there was no way Big Dog could possibly have known any parties had taken place – not that he was admitting there had been parties – because no one had told him he was breaking the rules he had made. As Robinson became more and more frustrated, Dom retreated further and further into his shell. It was all Raab could do to stop himself from referring to Johnson as “The Suspect”. Or “My Client”. Not that you could imagine anyone wanting Dom as their lawyer as his knowledge of the law appears extremely limited. He also claimed that The Suspect couldn’t possibly comment on any of the parties he attended as it might prejudice the ongoing police investigation. It would if Johnson tried to lie about them, I suppose. Then what else would Boris do? Raab ended by saying he hoped the Metropolitan police wouldn’t investigate too thoroughly – why break the habit of a lifetime? – and besides it was possible they turned up nothing in which case there would be no need to publish the full Sue Gray report. After all, who wanted to see pictures of Boris lying face down in a flower bed? Or staff shagging on the children’s swing. And he definitely wasn’t going to repeat the Jimmy Savile conspiracy theory lie, even though he saw no harm in Big Dog having accused Keir Starmer of protecting one of Britain’s most notorious paedophiles, just in case he got taken to court for slander. There was no lower for Raab to get, so the BBC showed him the door. There was no need to open it. He could ooze and seep underneath it. It wasn’t difficult to wonder if all the grown-ups had long since left No 10. A feeling reinforced later in the day when first a spokesperson said Downing Street had no intention of revealing if the prime minister received a fixed penalty notice, only to reverse ferret several hours later when someone realised it would be impossible to keep this a secret. As for Big Dog, he was in Kyiv trying to persuade the world he was doing something other than trying to hang on to his own job. A day trip that ended with a press conference that only confirmed the futility of the jaunt. Both the BBC and PA asked Johnson about the parties and observed if he was a serious player in the efforts to secure peace, he’d have taken Vladimir Putin’s call the day before. The Ukrainian media ignored The Suspect entirely. They knew he was irrelevant and they focused all their questions on President Volodymyr Zelensky. Johnson’s search for meaning remained unrequited.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson charm offensive on Tory MPs was a total success – we are told | John Crace,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/01/boris-johnson-charm-offensive-on-tory-mps-was-a-total-success-we-are-told
2/2/2022,"He is the toast of New York, of London – and of a small village called Llanddewi Rhydderch. Just four months after Josh Wardle invented the wonderfully simple and soothing puzzle Wordle, he is a mega star in the world of games and is a great deal wealthier after the New York Times acquired his creation for a seven figure sum.  But back in his home village in south-east Wales, which has a church, a chapel, a very old yew tree and not much else, Wardle’s family expressed quiet joy at their son’s success, and also, perhaps, a little bemusement. “We’re very proud but it won’t change him at all,” his father, Christopher, a farmer, said. “He’s not interested in the money side of things. He just likes creating. This all got so big so quickly.” His mother, Tessa, said: “I think this [selling the game] was the best way for him to manage things.” Wardle, who left the UK to pursue a career as a software engineer and is now based in Brooklyn, invented the game during a Covid lockdown to entertain his partner, Palak Shah. Wardle shared it with family members and, realising that it may be worthy of a wider release, unleashed it on the world in October. While he had an inkling he was on to something, Wardle has made it clear he could never have imagined it would become so big – especially as he had originally created it for an audience of just one person. In his statement on the sale, Wardle said it had been “incredible” to watch the game bring so much joy to so many. “I feel so grateful for the personal stories some of you have shared with me, from Wordle uniting distant family members, to provoking friendly rivalries, to supporting medical recoveries,” he said. “On the flip side, I’d be lying if I said this hasn’t been overwhelming. After all, I am just one person, and it is important to me that, as Wordle grows, it continues to provide a great experience to everyone.” Wardle is the youngest of three brothers. He lived in Llanddewi Rhydderch when he was a boy and the family farm cattle and sheep. They also have a lively sheepdog called Shep. The village is tranquil, with views of one of Wales’ most popular hills, Sugar Loaf, or Mynydd Pen-y-fâl. It last received publicity for a curious reason when it emerged that the Pacific nation of Kiribati had an honorary consulate there. Wardle attended a local state school King Henry VIII in Abergavenny, before studying media arts at Royal Holloway, University of London. His father said he decided to head to the US to study at the University of Oregon partly because of his love of the sport Ultimate Frisbee. “He liked to plough his own furrow, to use a farming phrase.” After college Wardle began working for Reddit, working on collaborative social experiments. There must be something in the water of Llanddewi Rhydderch. The writer Owen Sheers grew up there while Wardle’s brother, Tim, is a successful documentary maker. On his Twitter feed Tim Wardle described the news of the New York Times buyout as “big news in the Wordlesphere.” He said it had been “fun” to see his brother’s game “blow up”, adding: “Ironically, he decided not to do all the things you’re supposed to do to make a viral hit – like allowing people to play for hours or putting a hyperlink in the sharing function. It works because it’s atypical.” Wordle requires players to guess a five-letter word within six guesses, with grey, yellow and green coloured bricks used to indicate if guessed letters are part of the answer and whether they match the right place in the correct word. Once solved, players are able to share their own results on social media via rows of the same coloured bricks but with the letters removed, so others can see how they did without having the puzzle ruined for them. While the world debated the New York Times sale, at the farm in Llanddewi Rhydderch they were getting on with looking after their animals. “Josh had no idea it would take off like this,” said his father. “I think it’s come as a bit of a shock. He’s a very private kind of person. I don’t think he likes the attention much.” Jonathan Knight, the general manager for games at the New York Times Company, said the firm was “thrilled” to be adding Wordle to its portfolio and confirmed it had “no plans at this time” to change the game’s free-to-play nature, saying Wardle’s creation was “lightning in a bottle”.",News/Media,‘Incredible’: Wordle’s Welsh beginnings to the New York Times ,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/01/incredible-wordles-welsh-beginnings-to-the-new-york-times
2/2/2022,"An NHS doctor who was found by a court to have poisoned three people, killing one of them, has been suspended from practising medicine in the UK by the General Medical Council. The Guardian revealed earlier this week that a London court had found that the doctor had poisoned his partner and her parents with thallium, killing her father.  The General Medical Council (GMC), which regulates the UK’s 306,185 doctors, on Tuesday said that it had suspended the medic and is investigating the events that led to the court deciding that he was a killer. “The doctor is suspended from practice pending an investigation into the allegations against him. The doctor was suspended in January 2022”, a GMC spokesperson said. The regulator declined to give any more details. It is thought that it is still assessing whether there are enough grounds to refer the doctor to the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service, which investigates medics accused of wrongdoing and sanctions those who are found guilty. In the family court last year Mr Justice Williams ruled that the doctor had poisoned the trio, but he forbade either the medic or his ex-partner from being named. The poisoning came before the family court, despite it being a civil rather than criminal court, when in 2018 the doctor began seeking access to the son he had when he was still in a relationship with his ex-partner. Their relationship broke down in October 2012, a month after he – the court later established – put thallium in coffee that she and her parents drank while they were all staying together in Bulgaria, their home country. She and her mother became very ill but survived. Williams found that on the balance of probabilities the doctor had administered the poison, hurried back to the UK with his then partner and their child, and then declined to use his medical knowledge and contacts to get her appropriate care. His ex-partner told the Guardian she was “shocked” that the GMC had taken so long to suspend the doctor, given that he had first been accused of the poisoning in a previous case involving the custody of their child. That hearing, in 2020, also found that he had administered the thallium, a tasteless and odourless poison. However, the doctor appealed that ruling and the court of appeal ruled there must be a rehearing of events surrounding the poisoning, at the end of which Williams said he was satisfied that the man had carried it out. “The GMC was made aware of the outcome of the first trial at the end of April 2020. I was shocked that my ex-partner was allowed to practie medicine since then. “I would have assumed that if the GMC was going to conduct any investigation, then such [an] investigation should have been initiated immediately. I am shocked that things move forward very slowly, bearing in mind that a doctor was found to have killed a man”, she said. Simon Bruce, a specialist family lawyer who represents the woman, said: “The mother was intensely worried that her son’s father was practising as a doctor in England for years. “The General Medical Council has been informed of developments in the case on a periodic basis when this was permitted.” Bruce has acted for the woman – a bookkeeper – since late 2020 in his capacity as the director of a legal clinic run by Dad’s House, a charity based in London. Through the clinic lawyers provide pro bono advice to help people negotiate legal disputes. He added: “The president of the family division gave a speech in October 2021 in which he said that over half of the cases involving children in our family courts involved allegations of violence. “That may well be, but hardly any involve the killing of individuals, as this one did.” Delphine Philip Law, the doctor’s solicitors, declined to comment on the suspension but had earlier said that the doctor vehemently denies the mother’s allegations that he poisoned her or her parents.",News/Law,Doctor found to have poisoned partner and her parents suspended by GMC,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/feb/01/doctor-found-to-have-poisoned-wife-and-her-parents-suspended-by-gmc
2/2/2022,"A report from the Independent inquiry into child sexual abuse has found “extensive failures” in the way child sexual exploitation by criminal gangs is tackled. Over the course of two months in 2020, the inquiry heard evidence from more than 30 witnesses which revealed how police and local authorities failed to properly tackle the problem.  Evidence offered only a glimpse of the ordeals suffered by young victims. One victim, identified only as CS-A371, said her parents were heroin addicts and she was taken into foster care when she was 10 years old. From the age of 13 she was regularly sexually exploited by adult men who also supplied her with alcohol, cannabis and cigarettes. They were subsequently prosecuted, but the victim described the trial as “very much like I was being bullied” and said defence barristers accused her of being racist and “a slag”. Another victim, CS-A372, grew up in a family where there was neglect and domestic violence. From the age of 12 she was sexually exploited by a 30-year-old man who forced her to have sex with other men. She said children’s social care opened and closed her case on multiple occasions, with records showing one of the reasons behind a decision to close her case was because they thought she was “putting herself at risk”. Aged 14, she was forced to perform oral sex on more than 20 adult men. This was also filmed. A number of men were charged, although the charges were later dropped. CS-A317 spent her childhood in a number of council-run children’s homes. From the age of 14, she was sexually abused and made to have sexual intercourse with adult men. She said staff in the children’s homes were “aware that she was having sex with an older male” but were dismissive and took no action to protect her. The abuse escalated and she said when she was 18 years old, she was raped by the main perpetrator of her exploitation. No action was taken by the police, who considered that she had consented. She had a breakdown and tried to take her own life. CS-A317 felt that “it was easier for the police to criminalise the children rather than go after the abusing adults”. In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support for rape and sexual abuse on 0808 802 9999 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 in Scotland, or 0800 0246 991 in Northern Ireland.

2/2/2022,"“We have learned a huge amount from Jack’s,” said Jason Tarry, chief executive of Tesco UK and Ireland, as he pulled the plug on the group’s experiment in running an Aldi copycat format. One lesson is probably an old one: pure discounting is best left to specialists. Trying to run a limited-range discount chain is hard when your core business is, and always will be, mainstream grocery retailing. Sainsbury’s had a go a few years back in partnership with Danish group Netto and also got nowhere. In Tesco’s case, only 13 Jack’s outlets appeared, so no more than the 10-15 billed as “an initial phase” by former chief executive Dave Lewis back in 2018. It suggests the case for expanding Jack’s never got close to borderline.  One can see why boards of big supermarket chains are sometimes overcome by the urge to try to play Aldi and Lidl at their own game. The rise of the discounters is the most significant development in UK grocery retailing over the past 25 years. What the big players tend to overlook, though, is that it took Aldi and Lidl more than a decade to become a serious fighting force. The former launched here in 1990, and the latter in 1994, but it was only after the turn of the century that the privately owned German duo became more than an irritant to the major chains. Their biggest growth came after the helpful plunge in commercial property prices that followed the financial crash of 2008. Such investment horizons tend to be far too long for quoted companies. The smarter tactic is the one that Tesco and Sainsbury’s have increasingly adopted – just try to match Aldi’s prices on basic goods, especially fresh food, and champion the fact. It is jarring to see Tesco, the UK’s biggest beast, admit, in effect, that a smaller competitor is the real price-setter, but customers get the message. If adventures such as Jack’s were ever going to work, the moment was a couple of decades ago, before Aldi and Lidl got into their stride. Yes, best to stick to the day job. Here’s an unhelpful straw in the economic wind for Rishi Sunak. Consumers saved less and borrowed more than usual in December, according to the Bank of England’s figures. And savings habits enforced involuntarily during lockdown now seem to have reversed entirely. Household deposits in banks are back at pre-pandemic levels. These figures look suspiciously like the arrival of the cost-of-living squeeze, even before April’s hike in energy bills adds to the pressure. The actual announcement of the new price cap on energy bills comes next Monday, which is the real trigger for the chancellor to reveal what he intends to do to soften the shock. Remember that it is virtually nailed-on that the cap will rise from its current level of £1,277 for an average annual dual-fuel bill to about £2,000. The latest whisper in the energy supply sector is that Sunak will opt for a two-part approach. First, an extension of the warm homes discount scheme that is available to qualifying low-income households. Second, a measure that applies to everyone: the removal of a portion of the increase in bills (perhaps as much as £200) by deferring the hit to future years. The latter element would be the controversial one since nobody knows when wholesale gas prices will fall. The deferral approach carries a strong whiff of hopeful thinking. But one can see why the chancellor might be tempted: if he’s not going to budge on April’s national insurance increase, he needs to find something to grab attention. The squeeze is on. Jon Holt, chief executive of KPMG in the UK, says the auditing and advisory firm will “deal with and learn from our legacy issues”. In the meantime, the firm’s 571 partners can enjoy average pay packets of £688,000 for 2021, an increase of a fifth on the previous year. No doubt Holt is sincere about tackling those awkward legacy issues, but pre-tax profits of £436m, pumped up by advisory work on clients’ deals, puts into context the size of fines dished out for failures in the auditing division. Last year’s lowlight at KPMG was a £13m penalty in a long-running case related to the sale of the bedmaker Silentnight to a private equity group in 2011. The sum was a near-record fine from the Financial Reporting Council, but it barely touches the sides.",News/Business,Jack’s of all trades was not Tesco’s finest retail ploy,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/feb/01/jacks-of-all-trades-was-not-tescos-finest-retail-ploy
