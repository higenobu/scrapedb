4/19/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Major Japanese beef bowl firm Yoshinoya Holdings Co Ltd sacked on Tuesday a managing director who made derogatory comments about getting naive young women ""hooked"" on the company's products, saying his conduct was ""completely unacceptable."" Masaaki Ito, a managing director at the company - known for its inexpensive bowls of beef on rice - made the remarks at a marketing lecture at Tokyo's Waseda University at the weekend. A company spokesman said he could not confirm Ito's exact words. Ito was not reachable for comment. Yoshinoya, which in recent years has made efforts to expand the appeal of its dishes to women, said it had stripped Ito of all his positions with the company, effective Monday. ""His extremely unacceptable words and deeds could not be tolerated from the point of view of human rights and gender issues,"" the company said in a statement. Though Japan has taken steps towards gender equality, it remains far behind in many ways and ranked 120th out of 156 nations in women's economic participation and opportunity in the World Economic Forum's 2021 Global Gender Gap index. The topic was trending on Japanese Twitter, with many posters expressing outrage. ""Let's deconstruct this remark - he showed contempt for women, young people, people from rural areas and his own company's products,"" one poster wrote. ""In short, he pretty much insulted most of his company's customers."" The university has also apologised. (Reporting by Elaine Lies.

4/19/2022,"Tesla has stopped including a complimentary Mobile Connector Bundle with new vehicle orders. The change was first spotted by Twitter user Tesla_Adri, and later confirmed by CEO Elon Musk. The accessory, currently priced at $275 on its own, allows you to connect your Tesla to a wall outlet and get about two to three miles of range after an hour of charging. Based on feedback received, we will drop mobile connector price to $200 & make it easy to order with car.

Note, mobile connector is not needed if you have a Tesla wall connector or to use Superchargers.

Recommend installing Tesla wall connector well before car arrives. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 17, 2022 “Usage statistics were super low, so seemed wasteful,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in response to someone commenting on the news after it was shared more widely by investor Sawyer Merritt. “On the (minor) plus side, we will be including more plug adapters with the mobile connector kit.” Musk later tweeted that Tesla would reduce the price of the mobile connector to $200 and make it easier to order the accessory alongside a new car. He was also quick to note you don’t need an adapter to charge your Tesla at one of the company’s Superchargers or a Tesla Wall Connector installed in your home. At the moment, the charging bundle is listed as out of stock on the Tesla website. As Electrek notes, this isn’t the first time Tesla has removed a charging cable. the company previously shipped both Level 1 and Level 2 connectors with every new car, but later stopped bundling the latter adapter.",Business/Engadget,Tesla will no longer include a mobile charger with new vehicle purchases,https://news.yahoo.com/tesla-no-mobile-chargers-153253131.html
