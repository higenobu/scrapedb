2/15/2022,"The Asio chief has declared that his intelligence agency is “not here to be politicised”, vowing to defend its independence after the leak of details of an alleged foreign interference plot. Mike Burgess confirmed he held no concerns about any Labor candidates at the next federal election, and people should “definitely not” assume an Asio employee was responsible when news reports attributed information to “security sources”.  “I take our reputation very seriously. Asio is not here to be politicised. It should not be,” Burgess told a Senate estimates hearing on Monday night. Without criticising anyone by name, Burgess said he did “recognise that there may be people who choose to misuse [information] - officials or members of parliament or ministers” and “any misuse is a matter for them to answer to, not myself”. He said he was able to “have very robust conversations with all elements of the political class” and with officials “to make it very clear what I think is appropriate and inappropriate”. “I can assure you I will continue to do that when things like this happen,” Burgess said. The Asio chief’s forthright intervention comes days after the defence minister, Peter Dutton, ramped up the government’s political attack on Labor by claiming the Chinese government had picked the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, “as their candidate”. Dutton later claimed he based Thursday’s inflammatory allegation – ruled by the Speaker on Monday to be out of order – on “open source and other intelligence”. When asked about this comment, Burgess said he would avoid entering the political fray, but added: “I can’t speak for the minister what was in his mind and what processes he went through when saying that … I’d suggest that’s a question you should ask the minister not me.” The Nine newspapers on Friday reported “multiple security sources” had said a Chinese intelligence service was behind a recently disrupted foreign interference plot that had “attempted to bankroll [New South Wales] Labor candidates in the upcoming federal election”. That report prompted Albanese to tell reporters on Friday that the Asio chief briefed him regularly and had “never raised a concern about any of my candidates”. Burgess confirmed Albanese had given “an accurate account of the conversation I had with him last week when he asked me that question”. Burgess told the Senate committee that when he delivered his annual threat assessment speech last Wednesday, he “deliberately chose not to identify the election, jurisdiction, party, the individuals that were targets, or the country attempting to conduct the interference”. That, the Asio chief said, was because attempts at foreign interference were “not confined to one side of politics” and were being seen “at all levels of government, in all states and territories”. Burgess said it was unfortunate that “media speculation about who was involved” had “missed a key point”. “We stopped the plan before it was executed and the targets were not aware they were in fact targets,” he said. He said he had chosen to use the case study – without disclosing identities – “to raise awareness, in particular because we have a federal election approaching and it’s important that we all understand what political foreign interference looks like”. Burgess said Asio existed “to serve our national interest, not sectional interests or partisan interests or personal interests”. By law, he said, Asio must not “lend favour to one element of society or another or one party or another”. “So, we do not do that, but I can see how some people would be concerned by that media speculation,” he said. During an exchange with the senior Labor frontbencher Kristina Keneally, Burgess said he did not want to say anything that might confirm or deny the particulars of the foiled interference plot – meaning a lot of his comments were general in nature. But Burgess said it would be “totally inappropriate” if classified information was “released publicly without the appropriate process”. He said ministers and their staff with access to classified information were “subject to the same laws of the land that I am”. “When Asio product is distributed, people have the appropriate level of clearance and the reporting itself has the appropriate caveats that make it very clear how that information should be handled and what shouldn’t, in fact, by that very definition, happen with it, such as public disclosure,” Burgess said. “Where it is misused, that’s a problem - but I can assure you where it is misused, if it was hypothetically misused, I would look at whether I needed to do an investigation.” On Thursday Dutton told parliament the Chinese Communist party had “made a decision about who they’re going to back in the next federal election … and they have picked this bloke [Albanese] as their candidate”. When challenged, Dutton insisted he was reflecting “on what has been publicly reported and commented on by the director general of Asio”. The Speaker, Andrew Wallace, ruled on Monday that Dutton’s “insinuation” against Albanese had been out of order and “would ask that such comments not be repeated”, but stopped short of forcing the minister to withdraw. On Monday the prime minister, Scott Morrison, continued to accuse the Labor party of standing for “appeasement” – even though the opposition has given broad bipartisan support to the government on the key flashpoints in the relationship with China. Burgess has previously implored politicians not to bring Asio into political debate, as he disclosed in an interview with Guardian Australia last year. “I have general conversations with politicians about for example … ‘don’t make Asio the political thing, we’ve got a job to do, my organisation is apolitical [and] we’re here to serve the country [so] don’t bring us into it’,” he said in March 2021. In February 2019, the then head of Asio, Duncan Lewis, issued an extraordinary rebuke for the leak of departmental advice on the medevac bill to the Australian newspaper and misrepresentation of the advice as from Asio.",News/Australia news,Asio chief says intelligence is ‘not here to be politicised’ after Dutton accuses Labor ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/15/asio-chief-says-intelligence-is-not-here-to-be-politicised-after-dutton-accuses-labor
2/15/2022,"The BBC has retracted another episode of its new regional current affairs programme amid concerns about editorial standards and low staffing levels on the series. A senior executive has been parachuted in to help run the BBC One series We Are England, which has been made on a tight budget due to cuts after many experienced reporters took redundancy from newsrooms across England ahead of its launch.  The show launched last month with the promise of explaining big issues through a local lens, with six different regional variations going out in the same primetime Wednesday evening slot on BBC One. It replaced the long-running investigative current affairs strand Inside Out, which was axed amid ongoing budget cuts. Last week, the BBC pulled an episode of We Are England about a Birmingham man called Hanad Hassan at the last minute after the Guardian pointed out his cryptocurrency had shut down in October, leaving behind many unhappy customers. The BBC has now retracted a second episode of We Are England, which praised a dance school attended by former Love Island presenter Caroline Flack for its work improving the mental health of children. The programme failed to mention a recent critical Ofsted report, accessible online, which found staff had bodyshamed students, leaving them reluctant to eat after lessons, and told them to get “the desired physique” if they wanted to be successful in auditions. The governors of Bodyworks dance school in Cambridge had resigned due to safeguarding concerns and not been replaced. Students told Ofsted inspectors that “looking beautiful” was more valued by some staff than students’ talents in performing arts. Despite this information being easily available online, a BBC article accompanying the programme praised the work on wellbeing and mindfulness at the school without making any mention of the recent Ofsted criticisms. A BBC spokesperson said: “This regional programme focused on a school and its work on student wellbeing. It is no longer available to view online as the episode did not include relevant information and context about the school featured. We have also removed a related online article.” In June 2019 the BBC confirmed that it plans to make most over-75s pay the TV licence fee from 2020. The change will affect around three million households.  The BBC says the annual cost of the free licences is £745m. They argue that maintaining the status quo would have taken up a fifth of its budget, equal to the total amount it spends on all of BBC Two, BBC Three, BBC Four, the BBC News channel, CBBC and CBeebies.  The corporation has said it will continue to provide TV licences to over-75s who claim pension credit, a means-tested benefit designed to help older people. It estimates this proposal will cost it £250m a year, requiring some cuts but no channel closures. The policy of free TV licences for the over-75s was introduced in 1999 by Labour chancellor, Gordon Brown, with the cost met by the government. However, in 2015 the Conservatives, guided by George Osborne, struck a deal under which the subsidy would be phased out by 2020, with the broadcaster having to shoulder the cost. The government later gave the BBC responsibility for deciding what to do about the benefit, meaning any unpopular decisions on charging over-75s had to be made by the BBC rather than ministers. Jim Waterson, Media editor A senior BBC manager has now been brought in to oversee the rest of the show’s 120-episode run and attempt to stop any further such issues. Stuart Thomas, head of the Midlands at the BBC , will help BBC England commissioning chief, Aisling O’Connor, and the We Are England producer, Sarah Trigg, with the rest of the series. The BBC has seen substantial real-terms cuts to its budget over the last decade and faces further cuts under the licence fee agreement struck by the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, last month. Although regional newsrooms are often praised by BBC bosses, they have also faced deep financial cuts and lost many experienced staff. The ability of regional newsrooms to post articles directly on to the BBC website without going through central BBC News editorial structures has also caused issues. Several recent BBC articles that caused international headaches for the organisation, including a report of an attack on Jewish students in London and a contentious article about transgender people, were produced by regional newsrooms. A centralised Birmingham-based hub for editing online stories from the BBC’s regional English outlets was abolished in the latest round of cuts, amid warnings it would cause standards to drop.",News/Media,BBC pulls another episode of We Are England current affairs show,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/14/bbc-pulls-another-episode-of-we-are-england-current-affairs-show
2/15/2022,"Nico González had in his hand a piece of paper. Time was running out and unless they could do something about this - and fast - Barcelona were going to lose a Catalan derby at Cornellá for the first time ever in La Liga. It had only taken them 73 seconds to score one, but in 73 minutes they hadn’t got a second. Worse, Espanyol had. Sergi Darder curled in a gorgeous equaliser and then Raúl de Tomás put them ahead, meditating cross-legged on the grass ignoring the madness all around him. Xavi Hernández, though, had a plan, written down and sent by special delivery. Trouble was, writing it was one thing, reading it another. And actually getting it to come off, well, that was a step again. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had already replaced Frenkie de Jong. There were 18 minutes left when Nico and Ousmane Dembélé replaced Gavi and Jordi Alba. It was 25 days since Dembélé had been given an ultimatum: renew or leave; needed now, the man who was never going to play again ran back on at his club’s city rivals, where a reception less hostile than at home awaited him. Alongside, the kid from the academy came too.  Nico dashed over and gave the sheet torn from Xavi’s exercise book to Sergio Busquets, who turned to Gerard Piqué. This was a lot to take in - a back three, Sergiño Dest to the left, four up front, Ferran returning to the middle - and they looked a little lost, rotating the paper it like a map that was upside down or instructions for an Ikea wardrobe, a pair of Homer Simpsons wondering out what the hell le grille is. They could have been forgiven for wanting to simplify it all, concluding: why don’t we just stick it in the box for the big guy? Which was pretty much what they did in the end. The very end, the goal that rescued them coming in the 96th minute when Luuk de Jong headed in the equaliser. But that was then and this was now and for now that idea wasn’t really possible, which didn’t stop them trying. There was a piece missing, it seemed, when it had been right there all along, just been overlooked. And there’s that wardrobe again, this metaphor murdered. A piece no one thought mattered but which turned out to be vital when it appeared, everything finally making sense after all that sweat and swearing. Time kept slipping away, crosses too, but Barcelona were not really getting any closer, on course for a first defeat in ten. Espanyol, on the other hand, were. A night that had started with fireworks welcoming the bus was ending in celebration, their coach Vicente Moreno proven right. “I can see it in Raúl’s eyes; he’s going to score, to pull that thorn from his side,” he had said. R dot D dot T dot who had hit the post when Espanyol unluckily lost to Barcelona on Xavi’s managerial debut, had scored his 13th, 45% of all their goals, and they were 2-1 up heading towards added time. They had not won the derby in 13 years and hadn’t ever won one at the stadium that was supposed to change everything. Twenty-three games they had gone without defeating Barcelona, who sent them down to Segunda in 2020. That was already the joint longest run of any derby in Spain, after Atlético Madrid broke 14 years of failure against Real, but at least they weren’t going to hold the record alone.No wonder the place was going wild, songs belted out. The moments when they had been at their best, opponents bouncing off Adama Traoré when they weren’t hanging off him like he was Jonah Lomu and they were a family of Underwoods, Barcelona hadn’t taken advantage. Now that they had to chase, they had made few real chances and were struggling to find a way through, heading for a first defeat in nine. But on 88.04, Xavi sent on Luuk De Jong, going to five forwards and mostly going to one of them. Well, two: Out to Adama, in to De Jong. “It was a bit strange; there were a lot of attackers,” Aubameyang admitted, but it paid off. On 90.30 De Jong headed just off target, sinking to his knees. On 91.44 Piqué, who had mostly smiled at the stands, was sent off after a confrontation with Nico Melamed. On 93.01 RdotDdotTdot hit a 70-yard shot that was never going to go in but didn’t matter because booting the ball away would do. On 93.47, De Jong ran off to get a ball that no one else would. And on 94.55, Hernández Hernández, the referee so good they named him twice, who had given six minutes extra, raised a finger to signal one more. They didn’t need it. On 95.40, Adama swung in a deep cross. From near the penalty spot, De Jong jumped between three men and thudded a header down and into the net. Arms wide, he ran to the corner, leaving goalkeeper Diego López lying here, defeated. Only 15 more seconds were played. He had rescued them. Again. “We’re very annoyed,” López said afterwards. “We did enough to have won,” Moreno said. The manager, Darder had admitted, has a line he uses a lot: every game hangs by a thread. At the last, the rope was cut. “This can’t happen; the game can’t escape us on 90 plus,” Darder said. “It can’t be that Barcelona put so many crosses in; that they put a cross over in the 95th minute.” Adama’s delivery was superb. It hadn’t just happened when De Jong was there but it hadn’t really worked until he was there either. When Barcelona signed him, Ronald Koeman said he was “more dangerous than Neymar” in the air. Mostly people laughed “who cares about context, right?” which they have done rather a lot, when they shouldn’t. Koeman was right, for a start. As Jordi Cruyff, Barcelona’s sporting advisor, put it: “Every approach is valid. When you have forwards like Luuk de Jong and Aubameyang, the idea is crosses. You have two guys who are one metre 90-something, so it makes sense. Luuk’s a good header, a finisher.” Inside the stadium, they fell silent. Not just here, in fact. There has been a sneering, dismissive tone that has followed De Jong but has never been reciprocated. Instead, he has quietly got on with trying to do the things he can do, which are not always the things that Barcelona do or would do in an ideal world. He does so with no complaints, no messages, no demands. At times he has been treated as if he was not a footballer at all, rather than one that’s different, but asked if he felt mistreated a few weeks ago, he replied simply: “no.” Sevilla 2-0 Elche, Cádiz 2-0 Celta Vigo, Villarreal 0-0 Real Madrid, Rayo Vallecano 0-3 Osasuna, Atlético Madrid 4-3 Getafe, Alavés 2-1 Valencia, Levante 2-4 Real Betis, Real Sociedad 2-0 Granada, Espanyol 1-1 Barcelona Counter-cultural, not a natural fit for Xavi, Barcelona and Sevilla, the club that own him, reached an agreement to send him out on loan to Cádiz in January. He was told he was not part of Barcelona’s plans. De Jong, though, wanted to stay. He had just had a child and thought he could be useful, so he stayed and he was. He has scored four in the last five games: the only goal against Mallorca, when he started because covid meant there was no one else; the opener against Granada; and now this late equaliser in the derby. Barcelona are in a Champions League place. Without those goals they would be ninth. “Saint Luuk,” Sport called him, going all gospel. Everywhere, the inevitable puns were pulled out. De Jong had saved the papeleta, which is both a problem and a small piece of paper. Big goals, big moments, are a recurring theme: when he was at Sevilla, he scored 19 times over two seasons, including against Barcelona, Betis, and Manchester United; in the Europa League final, he scored twice against Inter. “I often hold him up as an example in the dressing room. He’s a professional and he’s a finisher,” Xavi said. This might not have been the way the Barcelona coach wrote it, his name not even on that paper, but it had worked. As for De Jong, he spoke quietly, indemonstrably, no hint of vindication. “I know there are good players here,” he told La Liga TV. “That’s what I’m here for: to come on when there are a lot of crosses into the box.” On Sunday night, there were, the last of them arriving in the 96th minute of a derby that Espanyol thought was theirs at last.",Sport/Football,Barcelona’s late special delivery breaks Espanyol’s derby hearts | Sid Lowe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/14/barcelonas-late-special-delivery-breaks-espanyols-derby-hearts
2/15/2022,"Humanity’s drugs have polluted rivers across the entire world and pose “a global threat to environmental and human health”, according to the most comprehensive study to date. Pharmaceuticals and other biologically active compounds used by humans are known to harm wildlife and antibiotics in the environment drive up the risk of resistance to the drugs, one of the greatest threats to humanity.  The scientists measured the concentration of 61 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) at more than 1,000 sites along 258 rivers and in 104 countries, covering all continents. Only two places were unpolluted – Iceland and a Venezuelan village where the indigenous people do not use modern medicines. The most frequently detected APIs were an anti-epileptic drug, carbamazepine, which is hard to break down, the diabetes drug metformin, and caffeine. All three were found in at least half of the sites. Antibiotics were found at dangerous levels in one in five sites and many sites also had at least one API at levels considered harmful for wildlife, with effects such as feminising fish. The APIs end up in rivers after being taken by people and livestock and then excreted into the sewer system or directly into the environment, though some may also leak from pharmaceutical factories. Hotspots with very high levels of APIs included Lahore in Pakistan, La Paz in Bolivia, and Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. Madrid in Spain was in the top 10% of places with highest cumulative concentrations, and Glasgow, UK, and Dallas, US, were in the top 20%. “The World Health Organization and UN and other organisations say antimicrobial resistance is the single greatest threat to humanity – it’s a next pandemic,” said John Wilkinson, at the University of York, in the UK, and who led the study, which involved 127 researchers from 86 institutions. “In 19% of all of the sites we monitored, the concentrations of [antibiotics] exceeded the levels that we’d expect to encourage bacteria to develop resistance.” Research published in January estimated that 5 million people died in 2019 from bacterial infections that were resistant to antibiotics. The regions suffering the highest impact from antibiotic resistance in that study closely align with those in the study with the worst drug pollution, suggesting the contamination of rivers may be playing a part in driving up resistance. One site in Bangladesh had levels of the antibiotic metronidazole more than 300 times higher than the safe target, possibly due to leaks from pharmaceutical manufacturing. Drug pollution was already known to be harming wildlife, from antidepressants causing starlings to feed less and contraceptive drugs reducing fish populations. “If I were a fish living in some of these rivers, I’d be worried right now,” said Wilkinson. However, the levels in most rivers would not deliver high doses to people swimming, he said. The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is by far the biggest to date and represents the impact on river pollution of 470 million people. The researchers concluded: “Pharmaceutical pollution poses a global threat to environmental and human health.” Previously, almost all the measurements had been taken in western Europe and North America but the latest research showed API pollution is often much higher elsewhere. The work included 36 countries in which APIs were measured for the first time, particularly in Africa and South America. Among the drugs detected on all continents except Antarctica were the antidepressants citalopram and venlafaxine, antihistamines cetirizine and fexofenadine, the antibiotic trimethoprim and lidocaine, an anaesthetic. The Kai Tak River in Hong Kong had 34 different APIs at a single site, the highest number recorded. “Ecological risks could well be greater than predicted for the single APIs due to toxicological interactions of these mixtures,” the researchers said. There are more than 2,500 pharmaceuticals in use, but current technology allows the analysis of only 50-100 from a single sample, so researchers focused on the most commonly used. The highest drug concentrations were found in low-to-middle income countries, including India and Nigeria. The researchers think this may be because people in these nations have enough income to buy pharmaceuticals, but live in places without good sewerage systems, which can remove drugs but are expensive. The study did not include measurements of illegal drugs such as cocaine and MDMA, which have been detected in rivers at levels harmful to wildlife, although future analysis of the samples may do this. The scientists hope the research will help focus clean-up efforts on the pharmaceuticals and regions at greatest risk. “We know good sewage connectivity and wastewater treatment is the key to minimising, though not necessarily eliminating, pharmaceutical concentrations,” said Wilkinson. “However, that is extremely expensive as there’s a lot of infrastructure involved.” Using medicines more carefully is another way to reduce the pollution, he said, particularly antibiotics, which are cheaply available in many countries without prescriptions, and widely taken unnecessarily, for example to treat colds. “Pharmaceuticals are almost omnipresent in rivers across the world,” said Prof Joakim Larsson, of the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, who was not part of the study team. “The study shows that a fairly large set of pharmaceuticals exceed ‘safe levels’, and often at a very large number of sites. Bacteria do not respect national borders, so if a new resistant bacterium develops on one side of our planet, it soon becomes a risk for everyone.” The researchers are looking to extend the number of countries covered, as the Covid-19 pandemic halted their surveys. They are also increasing the number of drugs measured and hope to assess levels in rivers across the year in order to examine seasonal trends.",News/Environment,"Drugs have dangerously polluted the world’s rivers, scientists warn",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/14/drugs-have-dangerously-polluted-the-worlds-rivers-scientists-warn
2/15/2022,"There was a lovely and rather poignant moment during Mollie King’s Instagram Live feed on Sunday morning. The radio presenter and former pop star was filming a video from her house, chatting gaily away about wellness and vitamin supplements, when all of a sudden her fiance pops up in the comments, apologising for the noise he’s making in the next room. “That must be him calling the front door,” Mollie laughs. “Stuart? I’ve shut the door so he don’t distract me. He’s sat outside. Come in, babe!” And then, right on cue, in walks Instagram husband: Stuart Broad, all 6ft 6in and 537 Test wickets of him, smiling sheepishly in an MCC training top. Another woman on the call, an Australian nutritionist, remembers that Broad has just been playing in the Ashes, and asks him when he’ll next be back.  “I’m not sure,” Broad replies, and for an instant his gaze sinks, and you realise that very few of the people tuning in will have the faintest idea of his turmoil, an interior chaos that may be passing through the stages of shock and denial and anger but is still very recognisably a form of grief. After a little good-natured banter, Broad leaves and the conversation turns to Mollie’s blossoming media career. Of course, Broad has been carefully nurturing a little media empire of his own: punditry, podcasts, newspaper columns. But for all the careful strategising and polished media sheen, there has always been a rawness there too: an untamed sporting animal whose wildest dreams still involve nipping one back off the seam and clattering off-stump. The world of television studios and celebrity magazine spreads and Instagram Lives will open its arms when the time is right. But it is not the thing he wants right now. The first thing to say about Broad and Jimmy Anderson’s omission from next month’s tour of the West Indies is that there is a certain perverse logic to it. For all their longevity and excellence, their numbers do not on their own make an unanswerable case: in the past 12 months Anderson averages 29.34 and Broad 30.20. Sooner or later England need their younger bowlers to shoulder more responsibility. That means taking the new ball, leading an attack, setting the tone of an innings. Emulation and example will only take you so far. The only real way of doing it is to do it. So you can see why Andrew Strauss and Joe Root – not blithe or reckless or unsentimental men – made their choice. None of which makes it any easier to process, any less sad or bewildering for fans of English cricket who will mourn this loss almost as sharply as the players themselves. And for all the bitterness and argument, something fundamental is being lost here. It’s no exaggeration to suggest that Anderson and Broad may well be the last great red-ball seamers this country ever produces: an endangered species that over recent years has been hunted – by market forces and cultural shifts – towards extinction. Consider: since being dropped from the white-ball side in 2015, Anderson and Broad have essentially been able to dedicate themselves to mastering the red ball, to the exclusion of everything else. What enabled them to do this? Money and prestige, for one thing: the primacy of Test cricket and the generosity of central contracts made red-ball specialism a viable career choice. Of course they could still play decent white-ball cricket, and Broad did for a while. But it did not need to be the fulcrum of their career. And so in part Anderson and Broad’s brilliance derived from the purity of their vocation. They didn’t need to perfect a back-of-the-hand slower delivery. They weren’t being pressed to add a few clicks of pace. They weren’t being pulled in five directions by franchises and the next contract. They didn’t have to worry about relearning their natural length every time they switched from one format to another. Will any England fast bowler ever enjoy that luxury again? Perhaps if they want to. Chris Woakes and Ollie Robinson could ultimately go down that path, even if Woakes is still part of the white-ball setup and Robinson has ambitions in that direction. But the rewards are diminishing and will diminish even further for the generation that follows them. An injured Jofra Archer will earn £783,000 for not playing in this year’s Indian Premier League, more than Anderson and Broad get for playing an entire year of red-ball cricket. Mark Wood has long been a white-ball bowler who makes occasional Test appearances. So too Sam Curran. Of course talented young fast bowlers will still thrive in all formats. But the type of bowlers who emerge will increasingly be dictated by the Twenty20 marketplace: extreme pace, the explosive and the unpredictable, bowlers who can also pinch-hit. None of this is a bad thing in itself: you only had to watch Jasprit Bumrah during the series against England last summer to see that white-ball smarts can be spectacularly effective in the longest format. But does the traditional craft of English fast bowling – swing and seam, mastery of conditions, six balls in the same spot – have a place in this new order? Will there ever be another English seamer who can control a red ball as skilfully as Anderson or Broad? As these modern greats retreat into the periphery, honing their golf swings, pacing the floors at home, they will doubtless be plotting their comeback. But in a way, the world they thrived in has already gone.",Sport/Sport,End of Broad and Anderson made sadder by them being last of their kind | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/14/stuart-broad-jimmy-anderson-england-cricket
2/15/2022,"Good morning. Nurses in New South Wales are expected to strike today, calling for stricter nurse-to-patient ratios and a 2.5% pay increase, despite orders from the Industrial Relations Commission to call off the action. Budget estimates hearings will continue. And there are fears Russian-Ukraine tensions could spill over. New Zealanders and Australians separated from loved ones for years are now counting down the days until they can reunite after the two countries announced they will relax the border rules for vaccinated travellers later this month. Vaccinated citizens and visa holders travelling to New Zealand from Australia will be able to fly there from 27 February and do 10 days of home quarantine, and those in other countries can return on 13 March, despite record Covid cases in NZ. We spoke to four people who have been affected by the countries’ strict border restrictions about how it will feel to be reunited with family and friends.  Vladimir Putin is adding more military forces near Ukraine’s border with each passing day, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said. “Should he want to use military force … it could happen any day,” he said. Here’s a visual guide of where forces are building. Russia’s ambassador to the EU has said Moscow would be within its rights to launch a “counterattack” if it felt it needed to protect Russian citizens living in eastern Ukraine. The comments in an interview with the Guardian will do little to calm fears of a major Russian assault on Ukraine, given one of the key scenarios suggested by western intelligence was Russia launching a “false-flag” operation to provide a pretext for invasion. The immigration minister, Alex Hawke, has been urged to heed Australia’s “moral obligation” to Afghan nationals fleeing the Taliban by ensuring resettlement places are on top of the existing humanitarian intake. Hawke previously announced places for Afghan nationals within existing visa programs, which critics dubbed “mean and tricky”. Mariam Veiszadeh, a spokesperson for the Afghanistan-Australian Advocacy Network, said Afghanistan was in “a state of anarchy” and urged Hawke to act. “With the stroke of a pen, it’s that simple – he’s able to save people’s lives,” she said. Sex worker social media platform, Switter, has closed down over legal concerns about online safely laws and the Australian government’s social media defamation legislation. A public servant investigated by police over the Leppington Triangle sale has rejected a finding the $30m price tag was inflated, accusing the auditor general of “unreasonable conduct [that] may constitute negligence”, in a submission to a parliamentary inquiry. The home affairs department paid $16,000 to a senior official to rent his house through Airbnb as part of a $522,000 program to accommodate staff who needed to quarantine after returning from overseas.

Antarctica’s two native flowering plants are spreading rapidly as temperatures warm, according to the first study to show changes in fragile polar ecosystems have accelerated in the past decade.

When Megadeth were too sick to headline a South Korean rock festival, Melbourne punk band Bodyjar stepped in – with blazing consequences. “[Headlining] was out of the blue and made me instantly shit myself with fear,” says Cam Baines. “When we finally got on stage in front of this huge crowd we realised they knew all the words to our songs and we had a great show. The only thing was, someone had neglected to tell us there would be pyrotechnics [probably Megadeth leftovers], so at precise moments in songs there were huge explosions that no one told us were happening. I lost some hair and bassist Grant Relf lost his eyebrows in flames.” Despite growing up under the tyranny of “no hat, no play”, it wasn’t until Lucianne Tonti’s late 20s that she started wearing a hat every time she was in the sun. “These hats may be the only thing in my wardrobe that are treated appallingly. They are stained by chlorine, sunscreen and salt. They get left at the bottom of beach bags and backpacks, squished between water bottles, books and towels. Hats should be treated with more care than this.” Whether it’s a trendy bucket hat or a classic straw Stetson, here’s how to keep your head toppers in top condition, at home and when you travel. “Australia’s parental leave rules entrench old social gender roles. Making them equal and gender-neutral could be our ticket out of a recession,” writes Jessica Mizrahi. “Paid paternity leave encourages mothers to go back to work earlier. What’s more, couples who share household tasks more evenly are willing to spend more time on paid work. It also incentivises people to become parents. At a time when population growth seems as elusive as economic growth, this is a pretty good deal.” As Omicron continues to spread in aged care homes, mounting deaths and severe staff shortages have placed pressure on the federal government to act urgently – but are they doing too little, too late? In today’s Full Story, Guardian Australia medical editor Melissa Davey speaks to Laura Murphy-Oates on the stark realities being faced by frontline workers battling Covid-19.

The court of arbitration for sport said there were “exceptional circumstances” surrounding Valieva’s case, and that banning her while it was ongoing “would cause her irreparable harm”. But Cas’s verdict was immediately condemned by several former athletes and committees. It is rare for athletes to get a fairytale ending. Caitlin Bassett’s retirement from netball last week is a prime example of an ending to a career that doesn’t quite sit comfortably. With 102 caps for the national team, she is not a player who many would have expected to finish her career by fading gently into obscurity. The ABC reports that Labor senator Kimberley Kitching has used parliamentary privilege to suggest prominent Chinese-Australian political donor Chau Chak Wing is the mysterious “puppeteer” behind a thwarted foreign interference plot to back political candidates in the next election. Greens leader Adam Bandt has ruled out a “Liberal/National-style coalition with Labor”, according to the Australian.

2/15/2022,"Boris Johnson is expected to deny wrongdoing to the police by arguing his presence at Downing Street gatherings in lockdown was part of the working day, though No 10 said his official response to the Met will remain private. The prime minister has until Friday to answer a questionnaire sent by the Met police which may lead them to issue a fixed penalty notice or conclude there was no case to answer.  He is expected to reject the allegation that he broke any laws prohibiting gatherings, but No 10 said it would not make public his defence. His official spokesperson said: “We will respond as required. As you know, I think the Met made clear that that was in seven days, so we will comply with that requirement.” Questionnaires have been sent by the Met to dozens of aides and civil servants believed to have been at gatherings in Downing Street during lockdowns in 2020 and 2021. Speaking on a visit in Scotland, Johnson said he would have “a lot more in due course” to say on the partygate row once the police investigation was concluded. At that point, the full investigation by Sue Gray, the senior civil servant tasked with carrying out an inquiry, is expected to be published. After the publication of Gray’s initial findings, Johnson apologised for the culture in Downing Street and claimed he would “fix it,” but he went on to strike a less contrite tone, throwing a false insult at Labour leader Keir Starmer suggesting he was responsible for the failure to prosecute serial sex abuser Jimmy Savile. Starmer confirmed on Monday that he had received death threats as a result of the slur, saying what the prime minister said was “very wrong” and he “knew what he was doing”. Throughout the scandal, Johnson has continued to insist he broke no rules, but apologised for attending one gathering which was a “bring your own booze” garden party organised by his principal private secretary on 20 May 2020. He is also believed to have been present at a birthday celebration in No 10 on 19 June 2020 and leaving dos for aides in November that year, and January 2021. Police are also investigating a gathering in his personal flat in Downing Street. If the police issue the prime minister with a fine, he could accept it or potentially challenge it. Payment of the penalty does not constitute an admission of guilt to an offence and does not result in a criminal record, but the failure to pay it could lead to a prosecution in a magistrates court. Bindmans, the legal firm, has pointed out there is no statutory mechanism for appeal or review of a FPN issued under Health Protection Regulations. They say those who choose not to pay may ‘request a hearing’ and be prosecuted, risking criminalisation. However, it is possible to make representations to the police requesting withdrawal of a FPN, or another route of challenge may involve the threat of judicial review proceedings in the high court. Bindmans said: “It is not clear whether the decision to give a FPN is a decision which the high court would consider to be susceptible to judicial review. However, we have been successful in persuading police forces to withdraw FPNs and pay our clients’ legal costs after sending pre-action correspondence.” Any penalty awarded by the police move has the potential to spark fresh expressions of no confidence in the prime minister from Tory MPs. Some backbenchers have held off calling for a ballot on his leadership until the outcome of the Met’s investigation, having suggested that they could submit a letter of no confidence if Johnson is found to have misled parliament or is fined for breaking the Covid rules he set.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson expected to deny wrongdoing over No 10 parties,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/14/boris-johnson-expected-to-deny-wrongdoing-over-no-10-parties
