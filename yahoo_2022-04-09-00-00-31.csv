4/9/2022,"SINGAPORE — Malaysian influencer Siew Pui Yi has apologised for wearing the Vietnamese national dress ao dai provocatively, saying that she will be “more sensitive” to local cultures. The former Penthouse cover model, better known as Ms Puiyi on her social media accounts, wore only an ao dai gown while she was releasing lanterns on the Hoai River in Hoi An, Vietnam. She posted two photos of her outfit on her social media accounts, drawing a barrage of criticisms from Vietnamese netizens for disrespecting their culture and traditions. The ao dai is a long gown with slits on the sides and worn with trousers by Vietnamese women. On Wednesday (6 April), Siew apologised on her Facebook page in three languages – Vietnamese, English and Chinese – and said she had deleted the photos. Siew said, “Hello all the beautiful people of Vietnam! To my recent travel to Vietnam, there was a posting of mine that truly upset the people, and I deeply and sincerely apologise for my actions/content and the disrespect to the traditional culture of Vietnam, to which I have now taken down…I apologise once again, and will be more sensitive to the local cultures all over the world.” Siew on Friday posted two photos of her wearing a bikini at a hotel in Hoi An on her Facebook page with the caption, “Vietnam is so beautiful.” In January, Siew made the news when she was chosen as the cover model for Penthouse for the US adult magazine’s January/February edition. She claimed then that she was the “first Southeast Asian woman” to be on the cover. Siew has close to 20 million fans across her Instagram, TikTok and Facebook accounts. She also creates racy content for the controversial OnlyFans subscription-based platform.

4/9/2022,"A Japanese organized crime kingpin conspired to broker massive deals with at least three insurgent groups in Myanmar, trading weapons—including American-made surface-to-air missiles—for heroin and meth to be sold in New York, according to a six-count complaint unsealed Thursday in Manhattan federal court. But what Takeshi Ebisawa, a 57-year-old Yakuza leader and the alleged boss of the operation, didn’t realize was that the middleman he was relying on to facilitate the transactions was actually an undercover U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent, the filing reveals. After nearly three years of secret meetings in Bangkok, Copenhagen, Bali, and elsewhere, the feds finally lured Ebisawa to Morton’s Steakhouse in Manhattan for dinner on Monday, where he was arrested with two of his alleged co-conspirators, a source with knowledge of the case told The Daily Beast. A fourth alleged co-conspirator was arrested in Manhattan the following day. According to the Department of Justice, the Yakuza control Japan’s gambling, prostitution, drugs, loan-sharking, gun-smuggling, and extortion rackets. They also have their hands in the nation’s construction and entertainment industries, abiding by medieval samurai codes of “blood, honor, and obedience.” The organization’s “militant nationalism…influences Japan’s economy and politics at the highest levels,” a historical DOJ analysis explains. It says the Yakuza have been active in U.S. cities including Honolulu, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, and Las Vegas. The Case of the Yakking Yakuza Ebisawa, who referred to weapons as “bamboo,” and drugs as “cake” and “ice cream,” in conversations monitored by federal agents, now faces a slew of charges including conspiracy to import narcotics, conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices, conspiracy to launder money, and conspiracy to acquire, transfer, and possess anti-aircraft missiles. He appeared in court the day after his arrest, and was ordered detained by Magistrate Judge Jennifer Willis. The DEA began investigating Ebisawa in 2019, the complaint states. That June, a paid DEA informant who served time for a marijuana conviction, met with Ebisawa in Tokyo to discuss a business opportunity. During the conversation, which federal agents had under surveillance, Ebisawa told the unidentified informant that “a rebel group in Myanmar,” which investigators believe to be the United Wa State Army, “was fighting against the government… and was looking for weapons,” it explains. “Ebisawa also told [the informant] that the rebel group produced and could supply [the informant] with as much methamphetamine and heroin as [the informant] needed.” The informant then introduced Ebisawa to the undercover DEA agent, who was posing as a narcotics and weapons trafficker, the complaint continues. In September 2019, the three met in Bangkok, followed by a meeting in Bali two months later, “to discuss potential narcotics and weapons transactions.” During the meetings, which the complaint says were conducted mostly in English, Ebisawa allegedly offered to act as a middleman between the undercover agent and the United Wa State Army. “Ebisawa used ‘bamboo’ as a code word to refer to weapons during the negotiations,” the complaint states. “Ebisawa explained that [he] was at that time looking for firearms, explosives, and other weapons to supply the ‘Wa State,’ which was fighting the government of Myanmar, and the ‘Khmer Tiger,’ which was fighting the government of Sri Lanka. Ebisawa also advised [the undercover agent] that [he] could supply methamphetamine produced by the Wa State to [the undercover agent].” In exchange, the undercover agent told Ebisawa, who said he was already in business with a cannabis distributor in Florida, that he could supply whatever weapons he needed, according to the complaint. They subsequently began to talk numbers, going over pricing and logistics, as well as quality control protocols. In February 2020, Ebisawa told the DEA informant that a Yakuza boss in Thailand known as “Sampo” had gotten a sizable load of heroin and methamphetamine from the United Wa State Army, which was available for purchase in Phuket. The informant told Ebisawa that he and the undercover agent were interested in buying a sample to test in the New York market, says the complaint. They met the following month, and Sampo offered the pair 1-kilogram (2.2 pounds) samples of heroin and meth. If customers liked the product, they would then “discuss a larger business deal,” the undercover agent said. Several months went by, with delays stemming from COVID-19 travel restrictions. In June 2021, a second paid DEA informant met with Sampo at a hotel in Bangkok. There, Sampo handed over a sample of his meth, which later tested 98 percent pure. In September, Sampo met with the informant in the hotel garage, where he handed over 1.4 kilos of heroin. If it sold well in New York, Sampo offered to ship 1,000 kilos to the city for a fee of $200,000, according to the complaint. In a later conversation over Signal, Sampo told the undercover DEA agent that the “top guy” in the United Wa State Army needed weapons for “the wilderness in the mountains” and “the staff from him also,” the complaint says, explaining that this was code for “protecting narcotics and also for fighting the Burmese government.” About a year earlier, Ebisawa told the undercover agent that an official with Sri Lankan guerrilla group the Tamil Tigers wanted to buy “bamboo.” By this, Ebisawa meant “weapons, including SAMs, rockets, machine guns, and automatic weapons.” Ebisawa agreed to meet the undercover agent in Copenhagen, Denmark to take a look at the merchandise. On Feb. 3, 2021, Ebisawa and an associate met the undercover DEA agent, along with two undercover agents from the Denmark National Police, at a Copenhagen warehouse. The undercover showed them “an array of U.S. Army weapons… including three portable M72 light anti-tank rocket weapons, ten 7.62 M60 machine guns, and ten 5.56 Colt Canada C8 fully automatic rifles,” according to the complaint. “In addition, the undercover agents showed Ebisawa and [his associate] photographs and video of 400 U.S. Army surface-to-air Stinger missiles purportedly stored at a nearby bunker.” After the rendezvous, Ebisawa contacted the undercover DEA agent on WhatsApp and said he would be traveling to Sri Lanka to discuss the deal with his buyers. He also said the political situation in Myanmar “was deteriorating, and that the United Wa State Army was interested in purchasing large quantities of weapons.” In May 2021, Ebisawa sent the undercover agent a shopping list of what he needed for a “rebel general” in Myanmar. The two then went over the necessary logistics involved in getting the arms to northern Myanmar. Ebisawa told the undercover agent that the buyers would build an airstrip able to handle a cargo plane, and provided the coordinates. A Thai Air Force general and a retired Thai military officer would be on hand to help coordinate the delivery, Ebisawa said, according to the complaint. At first, one of them accidentally included his last name in his WhatsApp profile, later removing it for operational security, the complaint states. But by that time, it was too late. From there, business continued to boom. Ebisawa brokered deals with the Shan State Army in Myanmar, and a third rebel group, the Karen National Union (KNU), expressed interest last August in buying $40 million worth of weapons. On a subsequent conference call, one of the Thai military officers said that his customers “prefer U.S.-made” weapons but would be open to alternatives if need be. The undercover agent told Ebisawa a made-up tale about contacts in Iran who had supposedly secured a stockpile of weapons the U.S. military had left behind in Afghanistan, including 40 to 50 Stinger surface-to-air missiles. A KNU officer said he could provide heroin and meth “at the metric tons level,” according to the complaint, while another officer said he was “getting goosebumps” hearing about the astronomical amounts of money being discussed, given the market price of heroin in New York City. Ebisawa asked about the “option for KNU payment in ‘sugar,’” according to the complaint, which notes that the men had previously used that word as code for heroin, while methamphetamine was “salt.” At this point, the DEA managed to get Ebisawa to agree to launder what he thought were drug proceeds coming into Japan. He would receive a 15 percent commission for his part, and in late November, yet another paid DEA informant covertly handed off a bundle of cash to Ebisawa at a Tokyo train station. Five months later, he would be arrested over prime charbroiled beef in Manhattan. In a statement, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said, “We allege Mr. Ebisawa and his co-conspirators brokered deals with an undercover DEA agent to buy heavy-duty weaponry and sell large quantities of illegal drugs. The drugs were destined for New York streets, and the weapons shipments were meant for factions in unstable nations. Members of this international crime syndicate can no longer put lives in danger and will face justice for their illicit actions.” Reached by The Daily Beast on Thursday, Ebisawa’s court-appointed lawyer, Evan Lipton, declined to comment. Ebisawa is due back in court April 19. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. Read more at The Daily Beast.

Although Jackson was confirmed in a 53-47 vote, the Kentucky Republican made his fellow senators wait over 15 minutes before the vote could be concluded, according to Politico. Paul, who was inexplicably absent when the vote stood at 53-46, eventually showed up and voted against Jackson — from the cloakroom, because he wasn’t wearing a suit. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) also voted without wearing a suit. Many people weren’t surprised by Paul’s behavior. He also blocked an anti-lynching bill in 2020.

4/9/2022,"Despite having only the fourth-largest military in the world, Russia is the superpower when it comes to its supply of tanks, with 12,950 in 2020 — more than double the number of the U.S., which came in second with 6,333 vehicles. As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues into its seventh week, it appears that President Vladimir Putin’s military forces might be taking a toll. Pictures of destroyed Russian tanks have been posted and shared across social media since the beginning of the war. As of March 24, the Kremlin had lost hundreds of tanks since the war began in February, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry stated. Russian vehicles have suffered heavy losses thanks to Ukrainian troops armed with antitank missiles, including the U.K.’s Next Generation Light Antitank Weapon, or NLAW, and the American Javelin antitank missile. This has led some experts to say that warfare has changed, and that tanks and armored personnel carriers are now obsolete. “They are too expensive & are easily destroyed with manifold light anti-tank weapons or drones,” Anders Aslund, an expert on Russia, Ukraine and Eastern Europe, wrote on Twitter. According to the open-source intelligence organization Oryx, Russia has lost a total of 450 tanks: 221 were destroyed, six were damaged, 41 were abandoned and 182 were captured. And Russia could lose more with the introduction of Switchblades, U.S. combat drones designed to attack personnel and light vehicles. On Tuesday, defense officials announced they were training Ukrainian soldiers in the U.S. on how to use the weapons to attack enemy tanks and armored vehicles. These 100 drones, which are carried in a backpack, were part of an $800 million military aid package to Ukraine. So with Russia having lost hundreds of tanks, does this mean these armored vehicles are now becoming obsolete in modern warfare? According to Scott Boston, a senior defense analyst at the global policy think tank RAND Corporation, it's a definite “not yet.” “The first and most obvious piece of evidence that I have for that is that Ukrainians right now are asking for more armored vehicles,” Boston told Yahoo News. “And they would very much like to get support from the U.S. and from the West with more armored vehicles and more tanks.” Last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked NATO to either donate or sell 500 tanks to his country. “You have at least 20,000 tanks,” he said to the alliance’s heads of state. “Ukraine asked for a percent, 1% of all your tanks to be given or sold to us."" A number of countries in the organization use the same Soviet-era tanks and armored vehicles that Ukrainian soldiers already use themselves. However, it is not clear what type of tanks Zelensky was asking for. One reason a large amount of Russian tanks have been destroyed, Boston said, is that Russia is doing the attacking — meaning Ukrainians are on the defensive, so they are targeting more enemy munitions. Boston said this is likely to change and more of Ukraine's tanks would be destroyed when it transitions to the offensive. Another reason for the graveyard of tanks is that Ukrainians are intelligently targeting Russian logistics, and so the ability to get fuel to the frontline has proved difficult. According to Boston, one specific Russian tank division lost a lot of vehicles due to abandonment rather than direct enemy action. With this in mind, Boston told Yahoo News he doesn't know that “we’re yet in the last generation of human-operated tanks.” He explained that this is because infantry will be used on battlefields for many years to come, and so protected transport for soldiers on foot will also be needed. “It’s an insurance policy for your infantry,” he said. “And the infantry protect the tank. That’s why they call it the ‘combined arms’ team. Without it, the tank is just as useless as everything else.” One former British Army officer, now a defense military analyst, said people should be careful to “avoid drawing the wrong conclusions” on tanks. “Russia's disastrous tactics have been a terrible advertisement for tanks,” Nicholas Drummond wrote on Twitter. “No artillery support. No infantry support. No air support,” he said, referring to images showing destroyed Russian tanks. “This is not how combined arms tactics work in an era of multi-domain operations.” But how was there no support available for these tanks? According to Boston, “Russia went into this fight apparently thinking that they had bribed enough Ukrainian officials. And very few Ukrainians actually wanted to fight them, and [the Russians] believed they weren't going to encounter serious resistance. They appear to have built their operations plan around that incredibly faulty assumption.” And so time will tell how tanks will show up during the course of this war, but one thing is for certain, according to experts: They will be around for a lot longer.",World/Yahoo News,Ukraine: A killing ground for Russian armor.

4/9/2022,"Red Lobster CEO Kelli Valade is resigning after just eight months at the helm of the Orlando-based seafood chain, a quick departure that one industry analyst called “very, very, very bad.” A news release announcing Valade’s resignation did not give a specific reason for her departure, which she called “an incredibly difficult, but necessary, decision.” It is effective April 15. “We’ve accomplished a lot in a short period of time, including building a great leadership team that alongside the board will carry the business forward to achieve our vision,” Valade said in the release. Valade took over as CEO in August after the retirement of the brand’s longtime leader Kim Lopdrup. San Diego-based restaurant analyst John Gordon called the resignation “very, very, very bad.” “No CEO anywhere wants to be on board a company only eight months. That says it all,” Gordon said. “That is an indicator of severe stress and malfunction that you can only stay on a job eight months before some sort of irreparable break occurs.” Prior to joining Red Lobster, Valade had been president and CEO of Black Box Intelligence since 2019 and before that she spent more than 22 years at Brinker International, including as brand president for Chili’s Grill & Bar. “Kelli has a very sound, very, very strong reputation in the restaurant industry as a leader and in casual dining in particular through her experience coming up through the ranks in Brinker, which of course has both Chili’s and Maggiano’s,” Gordon said. Gordon said the resignation is a bad signal to future CEOs for Red Lobster. He added everything becomes uncertain at a company following the departure of a CEO. “This kind of causes a shiver of ice to go through the management ranks,” Gordon said. Those management ranks have been changing in recent months, with David Schmidt revealed as the company’s new chief financial officer on March 14, Cijoy Olickal as chief information officer on March 28 and Patty Trevino as chief marketing officer on Jan. 18. When a tenure is as short as Valade’s time at Red Lobster it could be a mismatch in what was expected either by the executive or by the board from what the situation actually is, said Ron Piccolo, chair of University of Central Florida’s department of management. “It would tell me it’s probably not a great culture to be in or the financial operating circumstance is challenging more so than it might appear on the surface,” Piccolo said. “Why so abrupt? It’s not known whose choice it is to break the relationship.” He added it was unfortunate this would happen at a brand so important to Central Florida. Red Lobster board member Paul Kenny is expected to be a “liaison” between the company’s leadership and board during the transition, and a search for a replacement is expected to begin immediately, the release said. “On behalf of the Board, we thank Kelli for her service and accomplishments during her tenure as CEO, including navigating through the most recent wave of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Rittirong Boonmechote, chairman of the Red Lobster Board of Directors, in the release. “She has helped us assemble a talented and highly capable leadership team to lead us forward. We wish Kelli the very best in the future.” In 2020, seafood supplier and Red Lobster stakeholder Thai Union and a group of investors acquired the rest of the seafood restaurant company from private equity firm Golden Gate Capital. Thai Union has its headquarters in Thailand and its seafood brands include Chicken of the Sea, John West, King Oscar and others. The investor group that was part of the acquisition included key shareholders Kenny, the former CEO of Asia’s Minor Food, and Rit Thirakomen, CEO and controlling shareholder of Thai chain MK Restaurant Group. That sale came following concerns from outside analysts over a loan reaching maturity and while the coronavirus pandemic crippled much of the restaurant industry. Red Lobster, which has more than 700 restaurants, completed refinancing that debt last year. Before that refinancing and sale, the loan had more than $355 million outstanding as of a June 2020 report from Moody’s. Red Lobster’s operations “recovered significantly” in the fourth quarter of 2021, but saw a challenging start to 2022 with the omicron variant of coronavirus and higher costs, according to a presentation from Thai Union.",Business/Orlando Sentinel,"‘Very, very, very bad’: Red Lobster CEO Kelli Valade resigns after only 8 months",https://news.yahoo.com/very-very-very-bad-red-203900526.html

4/9/2022,"Russian troops talked about killing civilians in Bucha over the radio, Der Spiegel found. The radio transmissions were obtained by German intelligence and presented in parliament Wednesday. They contradict Russian claims that the atrocities found in the Ukrainian town were staged. Germany intercepted radio transmissions of Russian soldiers discussing the killings of civilians in the town of Bucha, contradicting Russian propaganda claims of a hoax, according to a report by Der Spiegel. The radio transmissions were obtained by the Bundesnachrichtendienst, Germany's foreign intelligence service, and presented to parliament on Wednesday, Der Spiegel reported. In one of the recordings, a Russian soldier could be heard describing how he shot someone off their bicycle, Der Spiegel reported. It is unclear what day the radio messages were sent and where the Russian troops were at the time. Footage and images of people killed, with some on the street, in Bucha emerged earlier this week after Russian forces left the town. On Tuesday, The New York Times published independently verified aerial footage that shows a Russian armored vehicle shooting at a civilian on a bicycle in Bucha. It is unclear whether the person in the video was the same as the one referred to in the radio messages. The audio recordings also suggest that the Russian mercenary military, the Wagner Group, played a key role in the atrocities in Bucha, Der Spiegel reported. It is not entirely clear who runs or finances the Wagner Group, but the US and European Union have linked Yevgeny Prigozhin, an oligarch and ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, to the organization. The group has been tied to Russian separatists in the pro-Kremlin Donbas region since 2014, as well as accused of committing war crimes and human-rights abuses in Syria in 2015. Western intelligence said last month that as many as 1,000 of the group's mercenaries were being deployed to eastern Ukraine. Russia has denied responsibility for the atrocities in Bucha, claiming without evidence that the footage coming out of Bucha is staged or otherwise manipulated. On Tuesday, the Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti ran an opinion column that speculated the killings were a ploy by Western nations to impose further sanctions on Russia. This timeline undermines Russia's claim that the Bucha killings were a Ukrainian hoax. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine tweeted the Spiegel report on Thursday, writing: ""Radio intercepts by the German Intelligence, show that the massacre of civilians in Bucha was not accidental or actions of rogue soldiers.""

4/9/2022,"LVIV, Ukraine (AP) — A woman on the verge of giving birth with her leg flayed open by shrapnel. A shockwave that shattered the glass and ceramic lining of a room with medical waste. A nurse who suffered a concussion. This is what the Ukrainian doctors remember of the Russian airstrike that destroyed the Mariupol maternity hospital where they once worked. And these memories are now all they have from a day they wish they could forget: Russian soldiers purged the evidence from their phones when they fled Mariupol. “With just one blow, there was simply nothing, no children’s clinic, it was simply blown away, ” said Dr. Lyudmila Mykhailenko, the acting director at Hospital No. 3 in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol. The sprawling courtyard of the hospital complex was — and remains — “one continuous shell crater.” Three doctors and a paramedic spoke with The Associated Press to offer new details from a March 9 airstrike that happened when communications were all but severed, and to counter fresh Russian misinformation. They left the city separately in private cars, as have thousands from Mariupol in recent weeks, and are now scattered in other towns around Ukraine and in Poland. Their testimony, along with AP reporting, AP footage from the scene and interviews with munitions experts who analyzed the size of the shell crater, directly contradicts Russian claims that there was no airstrike. Russian officials have repeatedly tried to sow doubt about atrocities in Mariupol, the shattered city in eastern Ukraine that is a key Russian military objective. In particular, Russia has made great efforts to falsely blame the death and destruction in the city on Ukrainian shelling. Two of the three doctors, like most who passed through Russian checkpoints on the way out of Mariupol, said their cell phones were searched and videos and photos of the city were deleted. People with what was considered suspect imagery or who lacked documents were separated out, but it’s not clear what ultimately happened to them. “I had lists on my phone, I had photos, I had everything, but we were strongly told to delete all of this,” said Mykhailenko, who spoke for two hours with hardly any interruptions with a fierce determination to describe the attack and her narrow escape. “The trash bin was deleted. … We had dashcam footage of everything that was going on in the city, but they made us delete that as well.” Most recently, a Russian government-linked Twitter account shared an interview last week with Mariana Vishegirskaya, one of the women in the maternity hospital. Vishegirskaya, wearing polka dot pajamas and looking dazed, emerged almost unscathed from the hospital airstrike. In the latest interview, the new mother said the hospital was not hit by an airstrike last month. She described the explosions as a pair of shells that struck nearby, saying she heard no airplanes. She left vague who could be responsible. She said fellow survivors from the basement agreed when they discussed it in the moments afterward. “They did not hear it either. They said that it was a shell that flew in from somewhere else. That is, it did not come from the sky,” she said in the interview. Vishegirskaya is now in Russia-controlled territory, but it’s not clear exactly where or under what conditions the interview was filmed. However, a team of Associated Press journalists working on the ground in Mariupol nearby documented the sound of the plane, then the twin explosions. One of the explosions blasted a crater more than two stories deep in the courtyard — consistent with an airstrike using a 500-kilogram bomb and considerably stronger than artillery crossfire, according to two munitions experts consulted by The Associated Press. Joseph Bermudez, an imagery analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the size of the hole and the visible effects of impact on the surrounding buildings leave no doubt it was an airstrike. The attack on the Mariupol hospital was one of at least 37 Russian strikes on medical facilities across Ukraine recorded by The Associated Press. Over the course of the war, every hospital in the city has been struck at least once by shells or airstrikes — the first was just four days after fighting began. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko said Wednesday that 50 people had burned to death in Russian strikes on hospitals in the city. Before the attack, it was a relatively quiet day at the Mariupol hospital. Dr. Yana Frantsusova was sorting medical waste in a room in another building at the hospital compound when the tiles and glass around her shattered. It was about 2:45 p.m. She started to run, but the shockwave slammed the door shut in her face. “I ran out with difficulty, and all of us, all people from my department, all the nurses, doctors who were there, everyone was already on the floor,” she said. “Then another explosion occurred.” Frantsusova had survived an airstrike once already, on a house near hers, and this felt the same — an intense shockwave followed by utter destruction. She and her team of medics got up from the floor to take in the injured and those able to walk. Among the pregnant women in the gravest danger, “one was already giving birth, at the moment when she was brought to us,” she said. Another had an open wound to her thigh. A third was in a state of shellshock, with shrapnel gashes in both legs. The AP journalists filmed two large plumes of smoke in the distance in the direction of the airstrike. It then took them about 25 minutes to arrive at the scene. By then, it was chaos. Paramedics raced up the stairs to bring down anyone who couldn’t make it on their own feet. Children and expectant fathers stumbled out the doors to an apocalyptic scene of blackened trees, smoldering earth and a crater big enough to swallow a truck. Vishegirskaya was already outside, hugging a blanket around her shoulders. When an AP journalist with a camera asked how she was, she answered “Fine,” then went off to try and retrieve her belongings from the hospital. In the interview with Russian media, she falsely said she told AP journalists she did not want to be filmed. Sergei Chernobrivets, a paramedic who was on the scene that day, described the injuries to multiple women. He said he wasn’t in a position to determine the source of the explosions, but he confirmed the extensive damage to the hospital compound. Dr. Yulia Kucheruk, one of the maternity ward’s physicians, said a nurse suffered a concussion and another medical worker was shellshocked. There was no point staying behind to try and retrieve usable medical supplies, she added, because “it was all trashed, in chaos.” Kucheruk spoke only briefly about a day that remains painful to revisit. Several women were transferred to another hospital, including Vishegirskaya and a woman with a fractured pelvis who died along with her unborn child the same day. Vishegirskaya gave birth the next day to a girl. By then, the Russian misinformation campaign was in full swing. The country’s embassy in the United Kingdom shared the AP’s photos of Vishegirskaya and another woman wounded on a stretcher, placing the word “FAKE” over the images and claiming that Vishegirskaya had posed in both in “realistic makeup.” The misinformation was repeated by Russian ambassadors in other parts of the world. Russia blames Ukrainian shelling for attacks on hospitals, including the one on the maternity ward in Mariupol, although their story of the violence that day has shifted over time. Twisting the truth about war crimes is a deliberate Russian tactic, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly address on Monday, just three days after Vishegirskaya’s interview was released in Russian media. “They have already launched a campaign of fakes to hide their guilt of mass killing of civilians in Mariupol,” he said. The hospital was struck again on March 17, and four or five of the patients lining the corridors were killed, Mykhailenko said. With no one to fetch the bodies, they were buried on the hospital grounds. Days later, in despair and with a leg ailment increasingly making it hard for her to run from shelling, she and her family packed up what little they had left and piled into the car. At the first checkpoint, her phone was wiped. At the second, their belongings were searched and their sole knife was seized. They picked their way through a minefield where a car had blown up the previous day. More than two weeks later, they made it to safety in Poland. On March 24, Kucheruk also drove out and headed for western Ukraine. She passed through 20 Russian checkpoints, including one where her cell phone was searched and its contents deleted.

They have lost the lives and the careers that they had built, and can only hope against hope to one day return to their destroyed city. “All your life turned into a pile of ruins in one instant, everything that was dear to you, everything you were trying to do, everything you were trying to achieve,” Mykhailenko said. “Everything got canceled simply because some guy threw this bomb after another bastard gave this order.” ___ Susie Blann and Vasilisa Stepanenko in Lviv, Ukraine, contributed. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,"Doctors, crater disprove Ukraine hospital airstrike misinfo",https://news.yahoo.com/doctors-crater-disprove-ukraine-hospital-100930401.html
4/9/2022,"A shocking video has emerged of a DHL cargo plane breaking cleanly in two on an airport runway. The plane made an emergency landing at the Juan Santa Maria international airport in Costa Rica. It was seen taxiing, then coming to an abrupt halt before its fuselage seemingly snapped in two. A DHL plane split cleanly in two after it skidded off the runway and came to an abrupt halt at the Juan Santa Maria international airport in Costa Rica. Video of the incident, which happened around 10 am. local time on Thursday, shows the plane skidding along the runway, taxiing and turning, then coming to a stop. As the plane stopped, its fuselage appeared to crumble, breaking the craft into separate pieces — its body, and its tail wing. Other videos from the scene showed the plane being doused with water by firefighters. Luis Miranda Munoz, deputy director of Costa Rica's civil aviation authority, told The Guardian that the aircraft was bound for Guatemala but encountered a failure in its hydraulic system. Its pilots requested to turn back and make an emergency landing after some 35 miles of travel, per The Guardian. DHL confirmed in a statement to Insider that a DHL Boeing 757-200 plane with the tail number JOS2716 had indeed ""sustained damage"" during its landing at the Costa Rican airport. ""We are pleased to report that the crew were physically unharmed in the incident. One crew member underwent medical checks as a precaution,"" wrote the DHL spokesperson. ""We are coordinating with the airport authorities on moving the aircraft from the area near the runway."" DHL also told Insider that the runway has since reopened and airport operations have resumed. The spokesperson added that an investigation is underway to find out what happened. A representative for Boeing referred Insider to DHL's statement on the incident. According to The Guardian, around 8,500 passengers and 57 commercial and cargo flights were impacted by the closure of the airport, which re-opened five hours after the crash.

4/9/2022,"The debate about trans identities and gender dysphoria has become very polarised – even for those of us who have lived through it. When the Government announced this week it would not go ahead with a Bill to ban conversion therapy for trans people, my response was mixed. At 18, I’d been prescribed testosterone by a private GP so I could transition to living as a man. The GP didn’t attempt to explore the possible causes of my gender dysphoria, such as my mental health problems or my difficulties fitting in socially. But even if they had, I might have insisted on going ahead anyway. I thought I knew everything about myself – nobody could tell me what to do. I was raised in Lancashire, in a very masculine environment. My mum used to work nights, so I was looked after by my dad. I also had two stepbrothers, eight years older. I wasn’t brought up with them, but we did socialise as I was growing up. After my parents divorced when I was 11, I spent a lot of time with my dad because my mum used to work three jobs. When I started school, I struggled to make friends with other girls. I didn’t care for Groovy Chick, or Barbie or Bratz – I just wanted to play football. There were a lot of social rules to female friendships. Male friendships were just so much easier: we’d fall out, we’d fight, we’d make up, we’d forget about it the next day. High school was a particularly difficult time. When I was about 11, I became convinced I was meant to be a boy. My male friends were all developing differently to me, and in turn that made me feel like I wished I had what they had – they were stronger and more outgoing. On Tumblr and YouTube, I discovered trans people who argued that some people who are meant to be male are accidentally born female. I thought: this is the answer! I was gender dysphoric, I was meant to be born male and there was no other reason why I might not get on with women. At the same time, I began feeling sexually attracted to girls, though later I realised I was bisexual. Aged 12, I developed depression and anxiety. I had a few sessions with a counsellor, who used words such as “borderline”, “bipolar” and “manic”. My parents didn’t really know what to do, and support from the school was minimal. It was my boyfriend, who I met in high school and who is also bisexual, who gave me the most support. To add to my distress, when I was 14 I was sexually abused by a stranger after being groomed online. I told my parents, who reported it to the police. Eventually, the perpetrator was tried and sent to prison. It was a hugely traumatic period. I started experimenting with my gender presentation and on Instagram and Tumblr, I changed my pronouns to he/she. I thought I was gender-fluid because the concept of transitioning was too scary. I was only 13 or 14 at this point. Some days I wanted to be girly, other days I wanted to dress like a man. In my final year at school, I remember saying to my boyfriend that I needed to pick a side. Some days I would say my pronouns are “he/him” and others I would say, my pronouns are “she/her”. Before going to college I swallowed my dysphoria, and for the next two years of my life I decided I was going to be as girly as possible and blend in and be totally normal. But when I was 18 and did my last exam, I suddenly decided I needed to go ahead with this transition. The big narrative being pushed is that transition will be the answer to all your problems. I confided in my boyfriend and he was very supportive because, back then, he assumed that doctors knew what they were doing. The NHS waiting time for hormones is about five or six years, so I saved up enough money from my gap year job to pay for private gender therapy. In March 2018, I contacted Gender GP, an online health and wellbeing clinic for transgender people and was given a 30-minute phone consultation costing £300; I never had a face-to-face consultation. In June, I was prescribed hormones. There was no exploration of my sexual trauma, and no mention of my upbringing and how that could have affected things. The consultation included a question about fertility risks and whether I wanted children. Because of what I’d read on social media, I knew I needed to say ‘no’ in order to be prescribed hormones. They didn’t tell me all the potential side effects, such as heart problems and loss of bone density, or the extent to which it could impact fertility. (A spokesman for the online gender clinic, GenderGP, says: “We operate an informed model of care – that means we start from a position of belief if you say you are trans. Our job is not to try and validate your gender, or prove whether you are trans. Our job is to support you to make the best decisions.”) For the first year or so, I was over the moon. I changed my name to Ryan. It took about three months to see changes, which included developing more muscle mass and broader shoulders. My periods stopped, which I was very happy about. Socially, I enjoyed going out and being read as male, and was pleased to no longer attract unwelcome sexual attention from men. My relationship with my boyfriend was pretty much the same, though when we went out we did sometimes attract invasive questions about how we had sex. I was a lot more emotionally stable – no longer having the up-and-down emotions that girls tend to have as a result of a hormonal cycle. My friends were all very accepting. Although my dad found the name change difficult, he said that as I was an adult, I could do what I wanted. I had been binding my breasts and had saved up £7,000 to pay for a double mastectomy, but in the end decided it would be better to spend it on travelling or buying a house. I’m glad I didn’t go ahead. Then during my first term at the University of Lancaster, where I was studying psychology, I went through a bad mental health episode. After attempting suicide, I was referred to a social worker. When I explained to him that I’d always felt like an outcast and struggled if things weren’t routine, he suggested I might have autism. After being referred to specialists for an assessment, my autism diagnosis was confirmed. It was like having pieces of a jigsaw come together, enabling me to see the full picture. About six months later, I decided to come off testosterone. The online clinic advised me not to come off it altogether, because of my gender dysphoria, and recommended instead that I halve my dose. Initially, I did this, but when my periods came back, I decided to stop it altogether. I didn’t speak to any other medical professionals and didn’t have any more contact with the clinic, except to cancel my £30 monthly subscription fee. Although I had felt happy passing as male, I was never 100 per cent comfortable. I was constantly worried about whether I looked too female. A part of me felt like I was lying to myself and others. Fertility was another big factor. When I turned 20, I realised I really wanted a family – and I had chosen to self-sterilise for no good reason. I felt embarrassed about detransitioning, but friends and colleagues were very supportive, although my dad was concerned and had a lot of questions. Initially, I missed the emotional stability I’d had on testosterone. I also hated getting my periods back, because ever since detransitioning, my menstrual cycle has been an absolute mess, and I am now being investigated for polycystic ovary syndrome. Apart from this, given my periods have returned, I should be able to conceive. Physically, one of the most difficult things has been the amount of body hair I’ve been left with – I still need to shave a lot. My voice is deeper than it used to be. But it’s great to be able to dress up again. And my boyfriend has been fine with me detransitioning – the good thing about dating a bi dude is they don’t care either way. The main advice I’d give to others with gender dysphoria is to wait until you’re 21 before going on hormones. Let your body be an adult woman’s body before you decide to change it. And listen to detransitioner stories, such as those of Sinead Watson and Keira Bell. If you believe you might have some sort of neurodivergence or a history of abuse, think about how those things might have affected you. I’m now 22 and feel a lot better. I dropped out of my original university course and from September I plan to study criminology at a different university. What’s been nice is that I now accept my body. I do experience pangs of dysphoria, but they’re nowhere near as frequent as they used to be. My long-term plan is to become a probation officer – and I look forward to a future that includes children.

4/9/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that if Finland and Sweden joined NATO then Russia would have to ""rebalance the situation"" with its own measures. Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, which it says aims among other things to degrade Ukraine's military potential and prevent it becoming a bridgehead for a NATO attack, has prompted the two Nordic countries to consider joining the U.S.-led alliance. If the two countries join, ""we'll have to make our western flank more sophisticated in terms of ensuring our security,"" Peskov told Britain's Sky News. However, he said Russia would not see such a move as an existential threat, of the kind that might prompt it to consider using nuclear weapons. Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 and the resulting fighting has caused the deaths of thousands of civilians and soldiers and the devastation of towns and settlements, as well as triggering an unprecedented barrage of coordinated Western sanctions.

4/9/2022,"Nova Basan, a town sixty miles east of Kyiv, was not the first town the all-volunteer Bratstvo battalion liberated from Russian forces, or the second, or the third. It was the fourth. What's more, Sunday's counter-offensive pushed the Russian forces—already in retreat, but still fighting—decisively out of the region.
 With support from the Ukrainian army, special forces and police, the hastily assembled volunteer unit has had a dramatic effect on the course of battle for Kyiv. The volunteers of Bratstvo, Ukrainian for ""brotherhood,"" are a mix of men who first served during Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea, and younger men eager to fight alongside on the frontlines this time. Russia's vehicular losses in the battle to liberate Nova Basan speak both to the Ukrainian fighters' skills and their capacity to fight at scale. Just one Ukrainian tank and two infantry vehicles known as BMPs destroyed or captured twenty Russian vehicles. Ukrainian forces lost one vehicle in the battle, which came to rest on a broken fence line, straddling two Russian trenches. Bratstvo's success in Nova Basan followed the momentum they'd built liberating three towns in rapid succession, and their deftness at fielding the enemy's captured arms and vehicles. While fighting to free the town of Lukyanivka, their first objective in the counter-offensive, the battalion had towed out their own damaged vehicles for repair using seized Russian tanks. In the neighboring town of Rudnytske, Russian forces abandoned their positions after only brief resistance. Then, on April 1, in Nova Basan, Ukrainian fighters tried a new tactic: Rather than attacking the enemy's positions, they ambushed a column as it withdrew though the center of town. It began with an artillery strike on a well-stocked Russian munitions truck as it entered an intersection, followed by tank canon fire from a concealed position on the column. It appears the Russian fighters panicked; they ensnared several vehicles in steep or muddy terrain, and their crews quickly abandoned them. Other vehicles scattered, only to be picked off on the side streets. On the outskirts of Nova Basan, two Russian armored personnel carriers that survived the ambush were met with rockets. Three occupants made it only a few feet away from their vehicle Ukrainian forces killed them. As of April 7, the district of Kyiv is effectively free of Russian forces. The Kremlin now claims that capturing Kyiv was never their aim. The eyes of the Bratstvo battalion now look east and south, where the war continues. Additional reporting by Masha Medvedeva.

4/9/2022,"As Ukrainian and Western officials have decried the atrocities witnessed in the Bucha massacre and around Kyiv, a hardened Chechen fighter and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin has been posting videos to his Telegram channel saying his men stand ready to finish the job in Ukraine. Ramzan Kadyrov, leader of the majority Muslim Chechen Republic, has reportedly visited the badly bombarded port city of Mariupol on the Black Sea as Russian troops have pulled back from the capital region around Kyiv and are regrouping to focus their offensive on southeastern Ukraine. US CALLS OUT ‘CREDIBLE REPORTS’ OF PUTIN'S FORCES HERDING UKRAINIANS TO ‘FILTRATION CAMPS,’ THEN INTO RUSSIA Western countries upped their sanctions against Moscow Wednesday in an effort to cripple the Russian war machine after photos surfaced showing corpses in civilian clothing lining the streets of Bucha, some with their hands behind their backs and showing signs of rape and torture. Defense experts told Fox News Digital signs of such killings are remnants of Chechen fighters or Wagner Group mercenaries who the Kremlin reportedly had been flying into Ukraine throughout the war effort to hunt down and kill Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Conscript soldiers, regular infantrymen serving in the Russian forces, would be less likely to be trained to round up civilians so efficiently and brutally execute them as evidence in Bucha and around Kyiv suggests. In an address to the U.N. Security Council Tuesday, Zelenskyy, speaking remotely from Ukraine, pointed out how some of the corpses had their tongues cut out, something ""terrorists"" have done in other territories. Meanwhile, Kadyrov, remaining active on his Telegram channel, released a video of his men sword fighting Wednesday. He said they are ready to ""go on the attack with sabers."" The intention behind the video remained unclear, but the Chechen leader, who once fought against Russia before he and his father changed allegiance to Moscow, has allowed himself to openly criticize the Kremlin in recent days, signaling potential fractures between Russian leadership as the war drags on for more than 40 days.

Taking to Telegram again, Kadyrov criticized Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman and Putin’s chief press officer, on Sunday for defending Russian TV host Ivan Urgant, who fled the country after criticizing the war in Ukraine, according to The Washington Examiner. Kadyrov said Peskov ought to be more respectful of his Chechen fighters who ""sit in a cold trench for several days."" He also slammed Peskov for failing to congratulate him after Putin awarded Kadyrov the lieutenant general rank in recognition of Chechen military service in Ukraine. The Chechen fighter added that Peskov’s ""priority scale"" is off kilter, suggesting, ""We need to do something about it."" Throughout the war, Kadyrov and his men have been sharing propaganda videos on his Telegram channel, recently claiming that trucks were arriving from Chechnya to supply humanitarian aid to Mariupol.

4/9/2022,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Russia has complained to Turkey over its sale of Bayraktar TB2 armed drones to Ukraine, a high level Turkish bureaucrat said on Friday, but added the sales were by a private Turkish company and not state-to-state deals. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 on what he called a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Kyiv and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression. ""Russians are upset and from time to time they are complaining about the drone sales. They used to complain and they are complaining right now,"" the bureaucrat said at a meeting with foreign media. ""But we have already given the answer ... that these are private companies and these drone purchases had been done before the war as well."" Turkey has forged close ties with Russia in energy, defence and trade, and relies heavily on Russian tourists. The Turkish defence firm Baykar had sold the drones to Kyiv despite Russian objections and signed a deal to co-produce more before the invasion, angering Moscow. NATO member Turkey shares a maritime border with Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, has good ties with both and has taken a mediating role in the conflict. It has hosted peace talks and is working to bring together the Ukrainian and Russian presidents. While supporting Ukraine and criticising Russia's invasion, Turkey has also opposed widespread Western sanctions on Moscow, saying communication channels need to remain open and casting doubt on the effectiveness of the measures. Ankara also opposes Russian policies in Syria and Libya, as well as its annexation of Crimea in 2014. After peace talks between negotiators in Istanbul last week, Ukraine listed several nations, including Turkey and members of the UN Security Council, as possible guarantors for Kyiv's security. The bureaucrat said some countries listed would face ""legal issues"" as security guarantors, without elaborating. Turkey has said it is ready, in principle, to be Ukraine's guarantor, but the details of the format need to be finalised.

French aviation officials said Wednesday they were investigating the incident. A tense cockpit recording revealed the moments anAir France pilot struggled to control his Boeing 777 during an aborted landing in Paris on Tuesday. The aircraft, a Boeing 777-300ER, landed on a second attempt at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris on Tuesday morning after an overnight flight from New York. Radio communication between air traffic controllers and one of the aircraft pilots was first published by industry news site AirLive and has since been verified to CNN by the French aviation safety investigators, the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses (BEA). It suggests the pilots could not control the plane as it approached the runway for landing. In the audio, one of the pilots can be heard grunting and panting as alarms sound in the cockpit. ""Stop it, stop it,"" he is heard saying. The air traffic controller then says that he has noticed that the plane has veered left away from the runway and instructs the pilot to ""stop approach ... immediately."" ""I call you back,"" the pilot says. After several seconds, the pilot informs air traffic control that he has stabilized the aircraft but was forced to perform a go-around after it ""didn't respond."" You can listen to the audio here: Air France did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment, and a Boeing spokesperson referred questions by Insider to the BEA. In a statement on Wednesday, BEA said that it had opened an investigation into what it described as a ""serious incident.""

It is unclear how many people were aboard the plane when the incident happened. The 777-300ER has a capacity of 396 passengers, according to Boeing. One passenger on the plane told CNN there were ""people shouting in the cabin"" after ""two or three sudden jolts."" ""Afterwards, the plane came back up,"" he added.

4/9/2022,"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) gave a telling nonanswer to a question about his moral boundaries that circulated widely on social media Thursday. “You are known for playing a ruthless style of politics. Where do you draw your moral red lines?” Axios’ Jonathan Swan asked the Kentucky Republican in an interview. McConnell joked that “my wife thinks I’m a really nice guy” and then said he was “shocked to hear such a comment.” “I’m perfectly comfortable with the way I’ve conducted my political career,” he added when Swan pressed again, saying he’d be happy to respond to specific examples. Swan then cited McConnell’s speech in February 2021 following the second impeachment vote over former President Donald Trump’s role in the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol. “You said Donald Trump’s actions preceding the Jan. 6 insurrection were ‘a disgraceful dereliction of duty’ and that he was ‘practically and morally responsible’ ― your words ― ‘for provoking the events of that day,’” Swan told the senator. “How do you go from saying that to, two weeks later, saying you’d absolutely support Donald Trump if he’s the Republican nominee in 2024?” McConnell said it should not be surprising that he would support the nominee of his party and that he feels an obligation to do so. Swan then wondered if there was anything a Republican nominee could do to lose McConnell’s support. The senator avoided answering, responding only: “I say many things I’m sure many people don’t understand.” The exchange drew sharp rebukes from commentators online, many of whom interpreted McConnell’s response as an indicator of his fealty to his party over the country.

4/9/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - The head of the Russian Orthodox faith was quoted as saying on Thursday that his church and its faithful were holding back the antichrist. Patriarch Kirill was speaking six weeks into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has forced over 4 million people to flee, killed or injured thousands and left cities and towns destroyed. While he was not quoted specifically referring to Ukraine, Kirill's comments backed the Kremlin line on the war by implying that Russia's actions there were a forced response to a foreign aggressor. ""Why did external forces rise up against the Russian lands? ""Why do they strive to destroy, divide, set brother against brother?"" Kirill was quoted by Russia's RIA news agency as saying. The Kremlin says the invasion is a special operation to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine, arguments Ukraine and Western governments reject as a false pretext for an invasion. Kirill, an ally of President Vladimir Putin, has defended Russia's actions and sees the war as a clash with a Western liberal culture he considers decadent, in particular in its acceptance of homosexuality. That stance has angered some within the Orthodox Church and in affiliated churches abroad. Referring to a New Testament text in which intensifying conflict between good and evil culminates in the second coming of Christ, Kirill said ""the Book of Revelation mentions a certain force that holds back the coming into the world of the antichrist."" ""Some thought it is the church that is holding this back, and that is correct,"" he was quoted as saying. ""The church keeps people from losing their bearings in life ... it is the Orthodox faith, living and acting in the Orthodox church – this is the force that holds back (the antichrist)."" Kirill said it was no coincidence that ""at this force today are aimed all the sharp arrows of all those who seek to compromise the church, to divide and tear it from the people,"" according to RIA.

4/9/2022,"On Wednesday, Amtrak joined Twitch to stream an empty railroad in Mississippi. The company is fighting to restart passenger service between Mobile and New Orleans. Freight companies argue that the service would ""unreasonably impair"" their operations. At Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, there's a set of railroad tracks used by freight trains. On Wednesday, Amtrak livestreamed the steel tracks on Twitch. Amtrak's goal was to show how deserted the railroad is. It's the company's latest move in an ongoing fight to restart passenger service between Mobile, Alabama, and New Orleans, Louisiana, which stopped after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, according to Vice. CSX and Norfolk Southern are involved in the dispute with Amtrak. The freight-train companies say the passenger service's plan to add four trains, or two round-trip trains, a day to the route without making infrastructure improvements would impair their operations, as Roll Call reported. According to Twitch, over 1,300 people tuned into Amtrak's stream titled ""CSX's Very Busy Gulf Coast Corridor."" ""We thought about putting up a live video feed to answer the question that people keep bringing up: How busy is the railroad anyway?"" a spokesperson for Amtrak told Insider. The spokesperson said that between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., Amtrak recorded five trains on CSX's tracks. Due to technical difficulties, the livestream cut in and out throughout the day, the spokesperson added. While Norfolk Southern declined to comment, a CSX representative told Insider in a statement that ""it takes a freight train about 8-10 hours to travel between New Orleans and Mobile. Focusing on one point of a line that traverses approximately 138 single track miles, major ports, and Interchange points and then purporting that it is indicative of the operational realities of the entire line is grossly misleading."" ""Anyone that understands railroad operations, including Amtrak, would know that,"" the statement continued. Amtrak has the right to access any US rail line under the 1970 Rail Passenger Service Act, according to Roll Call, and passenger trains also have priority over freight traffic, as Vice reported. However, Congress has also said that additional Amtrak trains can only operate provided they wouldn't ""impair unreasonably freight transportation."" In a November 2021 joint filing from CSX and Norfolk Southern viewed by Insider (and available to download from Railway Age), the freight-train companies argued that the Surface Transportation Board, which regulates freight rail, should deny Amtrak's proposal to start service on the route. They argued Amtrak's proposed service would ""unreasonably impair"" their existing operations. The companies added that if the board approves Amtrak's request, it should require the passenger service to pay for and install infrastructure improvements ""to prevent a near catastrophic meltdown of freight operations."" The filing also included a proposal for a plan to make improvements to the railroad that the companies say would cost between $405 million and $440 million, and add a total of 122,000 feet of track. Amtrak's spokesperson argued that the freight companies are ""essentially trying to veto the expansion of passenger service by holding the service hostage to $440 million or more in ransom."" The spokesperson said he expects it will be weeks before the board comes to its decision on whether Amtrak can operate its passenger service between Mobile and New Orleans.

4/9/2022,"Ammon Bundy likes to talk a lot about holding elected officials accountable. On Thursday, someone finally held him accountable. Bundy, who is running for Idaho governor as an independent, was found guilty Thursday of contempt of court and was sentenced to 10 days in jail and ordered to pay a $3,000 fine. Finally. He has refused to complete 40 hours of community service related to a July 2021 conviction of trespassing at the state Capitol. Bundy had argued — laughably — that his stops made during his gubernatorial campaign satisfied his court-mandated community service. It was a welcome sign to see an unapologetic, disruptive, perpetual lawbreaker be given a proper punishment Really, it just comes down to Bundy’s belief that the rules don’t apply to him. It’s part of a longstanding, well-documented pattern with Bundy. He and his family participated in an armed standoff against federal agents when the Bundy family refused to pay grazing fees on federal land in Nevada. And then, coming to the rescue of two arsonist ranchers in Oregon who were duly prosecuted and convicted, Bundy led an armed temper-tantrum takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, which eventually ended in the death of one of the protesters. Somehow, Bundy escaped conviction in both instances. Bundy, now of Emmett, Idaho, has led anti-mask protests, caused the shutdown of a high school football game over a mask mandate, violently forced his way into a Southwest District Health board meeting, led an unruly mob into the Idaho House chambers that resulted in the smashing of a glass door, subsequently got banned from the Capitol building for disrupting a committee hearing, returned only to be taken into custody for trespassing and was unceremoniously wheeled away in an office chair by state troopers. For his flouting of the law, he was given a light sentence for his convictions, and he could not even be bothered to complete that. We can only hope that his 10 days in jail will help him reflect on how to be a more positive member of society. But that’s probably too much to ask from a man with such a deep sense of entitlement. Camera footage from an Idaho State Police trooper’s vehicle showed Bundy immediately after his arrest in April speaking directly to a state trooper. “I’ll come after you — each one of you personally,” Bundy said in the video. “You know, I’ll do it.

If history is any indication, we suspect Bundy will sic his followers on the judges, lawyers and police officers, perhaps even the court deputies, ordering his protesters to their homes to shout, threaten and hurl obscenities in yet another temper tantrum because Bundy broke the law and doesn’t want to accept the consequences of his actions. And if his “followers,” who wear the same cloak of anarchy that he does, decide to protest improperly and illegally, and cause a ruckus over this, we can only hope there is room in the cell beside Bundy.

4/9/2022,"(Reuters) - Russia is facing its most difficult situation in three decades due to unprecedented Western sanctions, but foreign attempts to isolate it from the global economy will fail, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said on Thursday. Western countries are progressively broadening an array of economic sanctions imposed to try to force Russia to end its military operation in Ukraine and withdraw its forces. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. ""No doubt, the current situation could be called the most difficult in three decades for Russia,"" Mishustin told the Duma, or lower house of parliament. ""Such sanctions were not used even in the darkest times of the Cold War."" Western sanctions have already cut Russia off from the global financial network and left a number of its top banks with no access to the international SWIFT banking messaging system, while some traders have started to refuse Russian oil cargoes, intensifying pressure on Moscow's finances. Before the recent sanctions, Russia planned to run a budget surplus of 1.3 trillion roubles ($17 billion) this year, equal to 1% of gross domestic product. On Thursday, Mishustin said Russia would spend all it will earn this year on state aid. The government has so far pledged over 1 trillion roubles in anti-crisis support to businesses, on social payments and to families with children, of which 250 billion roubles are to be spent on state aid for the Russian Railways. Russia has introduced capital controls in retaliation for the sanctions, making it nearly impossible for foreign investors to sell their assets, both industrial and financial, if they decide to pull out of the country. ""If you have to leave, production should continue working as it provides jobs. Our citizens work there,"" Mishustin said. The Kremlin has suggested that it may nationalise assets held by Western investors who decide to depart. As some of the companies leaving are transferring their holdings to Russian companies, Mishustin said, the situation offered scope for new business opportunities. ""Our financial system, the lifeblood of the entire economy, has held up,"" Mishustin said. ""The stock market and the rouble are stabilising. I doubt that any other country would have withstood this. We did."" The European Commission proposed on Tuesday new sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, including a ban on buying Russian coal and on Russian ships entering EU ports, and said it was working on banning oil imports too.

4/9/2022,"Video appears to show Ukrainian soldiers killing captured Russian troops, according to The New York Times. The video was taken about seven miles southwest of Bucha, where hundreds of civilians were killed during Russia's occupation of the city. The video was verified by The Times, however, the outlet decided not to publish it due to its graphic nature. Video posted on Telegram Monday appears to show Ukrainian soldiers killing captured Russian troops in a village near Kyiv, according to a report from The New York Times. The video was verified by The Times, however, the outlet decided not to publish it due to its graphic nature. Per The Times it shows a Ukrainian soldier shooting a Russian soldier three times while another man says ""he's still alive. Film these marauders. Look, he's still alive. He's gasping."" The video, The Times reported, also shows at least three other Russian soldiers dead near the victim — identified by white armbands commonly worn by Russian troops. One of the soldiers has an obvious head wound and his hands are tied behind his back, according to the report from The Times. The soldiers are surrounded by equipment and are laying on the road near a BMD-2 — an infantry vehicle used by Russia's airborne units, according to military scholar Rob Lee. In the video, which was not independently verified by Insider, Ukrainian soldiers are identifiable by their blue armbands and repeat ""glory to Ukraine"" but their unit is unclear. A Ukrainian news agency said the ambush was the work of the ""Georgian Legion"" a group of Georgian volunteers that formed in 2014 to fight for Ukraine, according to The Times report. The video was filmed north of the village of Dmytrivka, about seven miles southwest of Bucha, according to the Times report. Earlier this week, graphic videos emerged of at least 300 civilians killed in Bucha during Russia's occupation of the city. Ukrainian officials say they were attacked as Russian troops were retreating. Ukrainian forces ambushed Russian troops around March 30, according to the Times report. In a tweet, Ukraine's Defense Ministry said it was ""precise work"" by Ukrainian troops. This is a developing story. Check back for updates.

4/9/2022,"By Michelle Nichols UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) -The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday suspended Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council over reports of ""gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights"" in Ukraine, prompting Moscow to announce it was quitting the body. The U.S.-led push garnered 93 votes in favor, while 24 countries voted no and 58 countries abstained. A two-thirds majority of voting members in the 193-member General Assembly in New York - abstentions do not count - was needed to suspend Russia from the 47-member Geneva-based Human Rights Council. Speaking after the vote, Russia's deputy U.N. Ambassador Gennady Kuzmin described the move as an ""illegitimate and politically motivated step"" and then announced that Russia had decided to quit the Human Rights Council altogether. ""You do not submit your resignation after you are fired,"" Ukraine's U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya told reporters. Russia was in its second year of a three-year term. Under Thursday's resolution, the General Assembly could have later agreed to end the suspension. But that cannot happen now Russia has quit the council, just as the United States did in 2018 over what it called chronic bias against Israel and a lack of reform. The United States was last year re-elected to the council. Suspensions are rare. Libya was suspended in 2011 because of violence against protesters by forces loyal to then-leader Muammar Gaddafi. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the United Nations ""sent a clear message that the suffering of victims and survivors will not be ignored."" ""We ensured a persistent and egregious human rights violator will not be allowed to occupy a position of leadership on human rights at the U.N.,"" she said in remarks to be delivered to the General Assembly later on Thursday. The Human Rights Council cannot make legally binding decisions. Its decisions send important political messages, however, and it can authorize investigations. Last month the council opened an investigation into allegations of rights violations, including possible war crimes, in Ukraine. The resolution on Thursday was the third adopted by the 193-member General Assembly since Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24. The two previous General Assembly resolutions denouncing Russia were adopted with 141 and 140 votes in favor. After abstaining on the previous two General Assembly votes, Russia's partner China opposed the resolution on Thursday. ""Such a hasty move at the General Assembly, which forces countries to choose sides, will aggravate the division among member states and intensify the confrontation between the parties concerned - it is like adding fuel to the fire,"" China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun said before the vote. The General Assembly text on Thursday expresses ""grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine,"" particularly at reports of rights abuses by Russia. Russia says it is carrying out a ""special military operation"" that aims to destroy Ukraine's military infrastructure and denies attacking civilians. Ukraine and allies say Moscow invaded without provocation. Russia had warned countries that a yes vote or abstention will be viewed as an ""unfriendly gesture"" with consequences for bilateral ties, according to a note seen by Reuters.
