1/7/2022,"The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and her Irish counterpart, Simon Coveney, have had a “good and friendly” first meeting over the vexed issued of the Brexit arrangements in Northern Ireland, Irish government sources have said. They met for the first time over dinner in London on Thursday night and discussed the Northern Ireland protocol, the wider relationship with the EU, and UN security matters including the crisis in Ukraine and Kazakhstan.  The meeting came less than a month after the Brexit minister David Frost quit and before a first meeting with the European Commission vice-president responsible for Brexit negotiations, Maroš Šefčovič, at the foreign secretary’s grace and favour home, Chevening. Truss and Coveney had previously met in 2014 when they were both responsible for agriculture but had not seen each other in person since Truss became foreign secretary in the cabinet reshuffle in the autumn. An Irish government source said: “The minister for foreign affairs and the foreign secretary have previously worked together in the agriculture brief, so it was good to have the opportunity early in the new year to meet in person. They had a good and friendly discussion on all matters in their current brief, including Brexit in Northern Ireland, as well as matters of the UN security council.” While the meeting was described as “good”, UK sources say Truss would not be dropping demands for further compromises from the EU on the Brexit protocol in Northern Ireland. The UK is seeking a radical reduction in trade barriers affecting consumers and businesses amid continuing threats by the Democratic Unionist party to leave the Stormont assembly unless the current protocol is torn up. The UK is also maintaining Lord Frost’s call for changes to the rules of state aid and governance and dispute resolution, removing the European court of justice as the sole arbiter in the event of trade disputes. While Truss has said she wanted a “comprehensive solution”, many have seen her appointment as a reset moment with expectations of fresh impetus to be forged at her meeting with Šefčovic next week. The UK has accepted that a two-stage solution may break the nine-month impasse, with a deal of customs paperwork and physical checks struck by the end of February to avoid a crisis before the Stormont elections in May. Under this scenario, the trickier governance issues would be pushed back to the second half of 2022, when political tensions over Brexit would have subsided in Northern Ireland and France would no longer hold the presidency of the European Council.",News/Politics,UK and Irish foreign secretaries meet over Northern Ireland Brexit impasse,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/07/uk-and-irish-foreign-secretaries-meet-over-northern-ireland-brexit-impasse
1/7/2022,"At 3pm on Saturday, Kidderminster, fifth in sixth-tier National League North, will hope to add another dream-come-true tale to the FA Cup story by knocking out Reading, the domestic game’s 41st-ranked side. “That’s exactly what we want,” says Sam Austin, the Carpetmen’s longest-serving player, who joined in 2016 and will line up as the No 10 in Russell Penn’s 4-2-3-1. The 25-year-old, though, was not always a creative force with a penchant for ‘worldy’ goals such as the 20-yard left-foot volley he blazed in against Manchester United during a pre-season friendly in the summer.  “When you get one, you gain the confidence to try again, don’t you?” he says. “You carry it on, you take a few more chances than you probably would if you’re low on confidence. But when I first joined it was all about earning experience, trying to get into the team. A chance arose at full-back and I thought: ‘Well, to get games I’ll have to adjust my playing style.’ I played there for a few seasons and I always loved the attacking aspect of full-back.” Austin had signed having been released after a debut season at Burton Albion. “I’d played at wing-back, too [but] since Russ took over 18 months ago, he’s played me higher and I’ve loved it even more. That’s where I’ve always meant to be playing.” Aggborough, Kidderminster’s home for 132 years, is a 5,000 sell-out for Reading’s visit, as the 2022 vintage try to emulate the class of 2013 which reached the fourth round – where Sunderland beat them (on Wearside) – and the 1994 vintage which went one better, before West Ham halted the run of Graham Allner’s team. Kidderminster are the lowest-ranked side left in the competition and there seems a disconnect between the competition’s much-repeated “magic of the Cup” mantra and how the club have been passed over for a TV tie and the lucrative money this would have provided. Two other non-league teams – Yeovil (hosts of Bournemouth), the next-lowest left, and Chesterfield (who travel to Chelsea) – can be watched live on BBC iPlayer. But, like Boreham Wood, Kidderminster have not even been granted this exposure. Reaching the third round has been worth £75,000 in prize money and about £100,000 in total but a live television payday draws a further £85,000, although after a stabilising of teetering finances under Richard Lane’s 75% ownership – the businessman bought in as head of a consortium in 2019 – this is not a seismic blow. Lane, whose father ‘Rocky’ was a Kidderminster director and owns the local workplace technology company EBC Group, has ensured Kidderminster are no longer threatened by winding-up petitions. Lane has attracted a new shirt and stand sponsor this season and the club are a full-time operation, with the annual wage budget ranking them seventh to 10th in the division. Aggborough remains equipped to stage EFL football, which the club played in from 2000-05. Yet Kidderminster took a sizeable hit from Covid so extra finance would have been welcome. As Penn says: “We were the lowest-ranked team going into the draw, so we thought that would work in our favour. Am I frustrated with the decision? Yes. Am I surprised? No. The magic has gone from the Cup a little bit. That’s not the case for us, but we’ve had to win five games to get here and you want to be rewarded a little bit more.” To reach the stage, Penn’s men have discarded Sporting Khalsa (of eighth-tier Northern Premier League Division One), Ware (eighth tier), Bedfont Sports (eighth tier), Grimsby (fifth tier) and Halifax (fifth). Reading, then, are first EFL opposition in the run and the highest at Aggborough since Wolves who, as now, were in the top division when visiting during the 2004 FA Cup. Austin is anticipating a vibrant welcome for the Championship side who finished eighth in the 2006-07 Premier League season and reached the Cup semi-finals and quarter-finals in 2015 and 2016 respectively. “It should be a brilliant atmosphere,” he says. “From the Halifax game, that was a little snippet of what’s to come on Saturday. When the fans get behind us, it’s just having another man outside on the pitch.” Owing to Covid Kidderminster have not played since a 4-1 reverse at Boston United on 18 December and last enjoyed victory the previous week – 2-1, again at Boston. Of the emotion that will surge on Saturday, Austin says: “It’s definitely excitement, because we can go out there with the feeling there’s nothing to lose. All the lads have been excited all week, and I think that’s what’s going to help us on the weekend to go out there, play our stuff and enjoy it. They’re definitely the biggest opponents that I’ve played against, and it’s definitely the biggest game of my career.” All Austin wants is to score the winner – preferably from his repertoire of breathtaking strikes. He says: “It would be unexplainable. The adrenaline would last for a few days, I know that. I’d probably never have to buy another drink in Kidderminster and I wouldn’t sleep for a few days.”",Sport/Football,Kidderminster aim to stun Reading and show TV snub is wrong call,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/07/kidderminster-aim-stun-reading-tv-snub-fa-cup-third-round-lowest-ranked
1/7/2022,"Michelle Jay was running an events business, but when the pandemic put paid to gatherings she decided to fulfil a long-held dream and open her own bookshop. The Reading Tree started out in May 2020 as online only, but in April 2021, when lockdown restrictions eased, Jay opened to the public. “The response from the local community has been absolutely incredible, they have really embraced us,” said Jay. “We are in the heart of the Northamptonshire countryside in the small village of Weedon, so the location has minimal footfall and we are completely dependent on the local community.”  Jay runs events, including Monday-morning story time for preschoolers and an after-school happy hour where children can come get a book, a cake and a milkshake for £5. “It has definitely been a huge challenge, starting a new customer-facing retail business during the pandemic, and coupled with a busy family life it has not been easy,” she said. “But I absolutely love it and I am so glad I took the plunge. I’m really optimistic for the future.” The Reading Tree is one of 54 new independent bookshops to have opened in the UK and Ireland over the last year, from Rare Birds Books in Edinburgh to The Ivybridge Bookshop in Devon, and from The Athlone Bookshop in County Westmeath, Ireland, to Storyville Books in Rhondda Cynon Taf. For the first time in almost a decade, more than 1,000 indies are open for business: it is a sector thriving against the odds. Between 1995 and 2016, the number of stores in the Booksellers Association (BA) membership dropped from 1,894 to 867, as the industry faced stiff competition from Amazon and financial pressures from business rate hikes. The number has slowly grown since, and in 2021 reached 1,027. Matt Steele, who has worked in bookshops in Hong Kong since the 90s, and last year “took the plunge” and opened the Ivybridge Bookshop. “Looking at the buoyancy of both the book market and independent retail in the UK, combined with the right timing to move back here, it felt like it would be now or never,” he says. “There isn’t another bookshop within a 10-mile radius, and with a lot of schools, young families and retirees living here we have some wonderful customers. We timed the opening for the end of the last lockdown, and so far business has been steady. If anything, circumstances may have weighed in our favour a little, with people shopping more locally where they can rather than going into the cities.” “Covid has been an undeniable driver in this movement towards conscious consumerism”, agrees Natalie Whittle, a former Financial Times journalist who also opened a bookshop, Outwith Books in Glasgow, last year. “I get lots of people coming to the counter and showing me books on Amazon that they’re seeking to order from us instead.” “The biggest challenge is not the the rise and fall of [Covid] variants but the lack of clear routines. Working from home, people’s days are more elastic than they used to be so it has taken a while to work out patterns and benchmark our regular trade. And I’ve yet to figure out how to stop my lockdown puppy from barking when people walk in!” The growth of independent stores conceals the fact there have also been 31 closures over the past year – but readers have also been voting with their wallets. The UK’s first specialist black bookshop, New Beacon Books in Finsbury Park, announced on 29 December that financial pressures were forcing its closure. But days later, it was revealed that a crowdfunding campaign had raised £50,000 to help it move to new premises. Fundraising campaigns also helped Book-ish in Crickhowell in Wales raise money to buy its own premises, while Afrori Books, the first black-owned bookshop in Brighton, opened in the autumn after a crowdfunding campaign raised more than £12,000. The profit-sharing platform Bookshop.org, meanwhile, is about to reach £2m of profit generated for indies. “After a challenging few years for the sector, it is reassuring to see the number of independent bookshops in BA membership grow for a fifth consecutive year,” said Meryl Halls, managing director of the Booksellers Association. “The fact that the number of bookshops can increase in the face of lockdowns, restrictions and supply-chain issues demonstrates the passion, innovation and determination of booksellers, who continue to bring books to readers even in the most challenging circumstances”. But Halls warned that “the high street is still in a precarious position, with potential disruption to retail activity and consumer confidence on the horizon, the playing field still skewed in the favour of tech giants, and supply chains causing issues across retail”. She stressed that booksellers still need support. She added: “We will continue to lobby the government to support booksellers and provide proper assistance and guidance, and are working with publishers and distributors to ease the effect of supply-chain issues on bookshops. And, as ever, we will work to encourage the public to choose bookshops whenever they can”",Arts/Books,New chapter of hope: indie bookshops defy the odds to hit nine-year UK high,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/07/indie-bookshops-nine-year-high
1/7/2022,"Families of care home residents isolated in a rising wave of Omicron lockdowns are pleading to be allowed in, saying they can alleviate staff shortages and comfort loved ones facing a winter of loneliness. Relatives have warned of more deaths triggered by isolation unless ministers ease rules requiring settings with two or more positive cases to close to all but essential caregivers for up to 28 days.  The number of English care homes that recorded at least one positive Covid case in the last week of 2021 rose nearly 40% compared with before Christmas, to 764 – more than at the previous peak of the pandemic in January 2021. Families have also described anguish at not being able to help with chores as care home staff rotas are decimated. With high levels of triple vaccination in care homes and an apparently less dangerous virus in circulation, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, is facing calls to let families reunite. “The impact of loneliness and isolation has far outweighed the impact of Covid on care home residents in the later part of the pandemic,” said Jenny Morrison, a co-founder of the Rights for Residents campaign group. “We need to ensure that measures put in place to protect residents are proportionate to the current situation.” Sixty-five people died from Covid in England’s care homes in the week to 31 December, compared with about 1,850 in January 2021. Birgit Clark, whose daughter Franziska, 26, has severe learning difficulties and lives in a care home in Cheshire, said: “I want to go in and help her out. It’s horrific. I just don’t understand why you would not utilise someone who is willing and able and free when you are struggling. We could all be happier.” Clark said her daughter was getting less time walking outside, their visits together to shops and cafes were now prohibited and Franziska was becoming more withdrawn. “I have said I will drop everything and will help out, but we’re not allowed to do that,” she said. “My daughter is alive and well, but she doesn’t have a life.” Joanna Casson, a registered nurse who is no longer able to visit her 81-year-old mother at her Teesside nursing home after an outbreak started after Christmas, said: “Everyone needs more than just the medical side of care. They need love and stimulation.” Her mother is confined to her room and cannot have a shower or bath. Casson used to visit most days and would care for her mother’s nails, wash her hair and give her massages. She now visits at the window and talks to her by phone. This week the Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts told Boris Johnson in the Commons that she feared separation from her mother, who has dementia, when she moves from a hospital into a nursing home. She said: “The human rights of disabled people, sick people and the elderly are not fair weather luxuries, and everyone with dementia, wherever they live, has the right to care from a family member.” The MP is set to meet Javid next week to press the case for greater rights of access. Care home operators have also called for restrictions to be lifted. The chief executive of Four Seasons Health Care, Jeremy Richardson, told the Guardian it was “an outrage” that people were being deprived of their right to receive visitors. Sam Monaghan, the chief executive of MHA, criticised the “huge disparity” between the seven days isolation for the general population and 28 days for care home residents. At Summerfield House care home in Halifax, a substantial outbreak among residents and staff has led local health officials to impose a 28-day lockdown, although no one is seriously ill. Penny Hutchinson is allowed in as an essential caregiver for her mother, Yvonne Williamson, 81. With 10% of staff off with Covid, she wants access for her siblings and for other residents’ families to help. “When she [her mother] sees carers, she knows, her face lights up. But she won’t drink and take food from [staff] she doesn’t know,” she said. “What they do when there is no stimulation is they sleep and then people don’t want to disturb them for a drink and it leads to dehydration. That’s not just happening in Mum’s home but across the country.” When asked for a response, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care cited visiting guidance for homes without outbreaks. “We are doing everything we can to support care providers to facilitate safe visits and guidance was changed to allow each resident three listed visitors, as well as an essential caregiver, either a family member or friend, who may visit the home to offer companionship or help with care needs,” they said. “Essential caregivers should be able to visit inside the care home even during periods of outbreak.”",News/Society,Relatives plead for care home isolation rules in England to be relaxed,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/07/relatives-plead-for-care-home-isolation-rules-in-england-to-be-relaxed
1/7/2022,"Sir Tony Blair is a striking case study of how elite opinion and popular common sense collide. In media and political circles, Blair is a respected statesman: when he speaks, agree or not, you listen. His passionate detractors are essentially treated as cranks suffering from an acute case of Blair Derangement Syndrome: an unholy alliance of rightwingers enraged by three consecutive Tory defeats and leftwingers still bitterly resentful about their exile during the New Labour era. Yet among the electorate, sympathy for Blair belongs to the fringe. According to a new YouGov survey, just 14% approve of his knighthood – fewer than believe the moon landings were faked – and only 3% strongly so, while 63% disapprove, 41% strongly so. A decisive 56% of Labour voters disapprove, two and a half times more than approve. Meanwhile, almost a million people have signed a petition demanding the knighthood be rescinded.  How Blair went from a prime minister with a 93% approval rating in 1997 to one of Britain’s most loathed public figures – including among his own political tribe – offers invaluable lessons for Labour’s future. There has been no shortage of attempts to rehabilitate him. His frequent public utterances are accompanied by deferential, soft-soap interviews, and Keir Starmer is surrounded by aides (including close associates of Peter Mandelson) who regard recovering Blair’s reputation as a political and moral imperative. The most obvious lesson is, of course, is: don’t launch a bloody war of aggression in conjunction with a hard-right US administration. Blair’s former defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, this week claimed he was asked to burn a memo from the attorney general questioning the Iraq war’s legality; for many of us, former UN secretary general Kofi Annan’s conclusion that it was illegal was already sufficient. Merely mentioning the Iraq war often sets off a cascade of eyerolls, of oh-so-bored retorts of “Move on!” and “Still going on about that, are we?”. Such sentiments, alas, are firmly placed in the long, tawdry tradition of the west’s contempt for brown and black victims of its foreign horrors: if hundreds of thousands of white westerners had so recently been slaughtered, their lives would not be so impatiently dismissed. As protesters courageously battle Kazakhstan’s dictatorship, Blair’s later CV warrants more than a cursory glance. Nursultan Nazarbayev is one of many despots Blair’s foundations have taken millions from: more gruesomely, our former prime minister offered his regime PR advice after it massacred 15 civilian protesters. Now, most of the public are not aware of the finer details of Blair’s association with various tyrannies – including receiving millions from the Saudi regime, which he shielded from a corruption inquiry when he was in No 10. What has cut through is a sense that Blair genuflects before wealth and power while lacking any apparent moral compass. But it’s a mistake to conclude that Blair’s toxicity relies entirely on foreign horrors. Margaret Thatcher is adored by her own tribe because she transformed Britain in accordance with its most radically held, and long-suppressed wishes. The Tories before her, she declared, had “merely pitched camp in the long march to the left” by accepting the postwar consensus of public ownership, the welfare state and public spending. Those she delighted in facing down – from the trade unions to the municipal left – were the bogeymen of her grassroots, rather than her own kind. Blair mirrored the Tory predecessors Thatcher scolded – “I always thought my job was to build on some of the things she had done rather than reverse them,” he said, on Thatcher’s death – and delighted in confronting elements of Labour’s own coalition. When he assailed the “forces of conservatism”, he included trade unions. While Thatcher’s zeal for privatisation went with the grain of her grassroots, Blair’s own passionate advocacy for expanding the role of the private sector in public services – not least in the NHS, Labour’s most treasured institution – did the opposite. Blair’s reputational downfall cannot be understood without examining his record on immigration either. Under New Labour, immigration did rise sharply, yet without the government making a political argument for it. Meanwhile, a growing housing crisis, caused by the failure to build, and a squeeze on living standards that predated the 2007-8 financial crash – the income of the bottom half flatlined after 2004 while for the bottom third it actually fell – created ample fodder for those seeking to scapegoat migrants. Without Labour offering a counternarrative, or indeed viable solutions to these grievances, anti-migrant sentiment overwhelmed British politics, culminating in Brexit. This issue, too, toxified New Labour, and Blair with it. And here’s the tragedy: Labour did have proud achievements in this period: from the minimum wage to tax credits, from gay rights to public investment (albeit undermined by creeping privatisation), from lifting millions of children and pensioners out of poverty to reducing homelessness. Yet this record was lethally undermined in three ways. First, Blair sought not to emphasise these wins, instead glorifying, say, public-sector reform (code for marketisation), which alienated his own side. Second, these transformative policies relied on an unsustainable financial bubble that inevitably popped. Third, Blair not only failed to defend his own government from the Tories’ post-crash deceit that Labour overspending caused economic calamity, he furthered it – castigating his party for failing on deficit reduction after 2005 and cautioning against blanket opposition to George Osborne’s slash-and-burn economics. That allowed the mainstreaming of the lie that the government Blair himself headed was unsustainably profligate. Thatcher forged a new political consensus that she forced her opponents to accept; hence her proclamation that New Labour was her greatest achievement. Blairism did no such thing. Its greatest achievement, public investment, was not only swept away after defeat, it was positively demonised. Its other pillar – an inconsistent social liberalism, which included gay rights but which was undermined by often cartoonishly authoritarian home secretaries – has utterly crumbled. So what lessons for Labour today? That relentlessly confronting the interests and values of your own tribe is both politically avoidable and ultimately self-defeating. That relegating progressive values isn’t the strategic genius it might seem to be. And that failing to address growing social and economic insecurities will unleash political forces that will consume you. Blair’s own hubristic belief in his own political genius blinded him to these truths. It’s too late for him: it’s not too late for Labour.

1/7/2022,"Bibo in Shoreditch, a sophisticated Spanish restaurant by chef Dani García, was definitely a night of firsts. A pivotal moment in my restaurant-reviewing career came when, just after eating my porcini croquettes, I downloaded a decibel-monitoring app on to my phone. There was something brazenly cranky about doing so, true, and it was without doubt cringingly uncool, too, but after a certain age, you just don’t bloody care and it’s marvellous. In Bibo’s defence, however, this had been brewing. Many restaurants these days are far too noisy. I can tell this by how, in some places, I have to lipread my guest from almost the second I’m seated or nod pointlessly while I guess the rough gist of what they’re telling me. And how, time and again, I suddenly become quite subdued, because going into detail during an anecdote is futile. Dinner with friends is all about telling stories, and stories are all about detail; they are also about timing and red herrings and withholding information until the perfect point. And none of that can happen at places such as Bibo that, my new app told me, play dance music at 84 decibels. Am I the only person who, when cooking in my own kitchen, turns down the radio to concentrate when I taste and season, as if my senses can properly focus on only one thing?  Bibo has taken over the space that restaurant fans may remember as Marcus Samuelsson’s Red Rooster in the Curtain hotel, and now the London outpost of the Mondrian group. Bibo, in the basement, is admittedly slap-bang in central Shoreditch, so many visitors will want, nay, expect it to be loud and more like a cocktail bar or club that serves a few tapas mainly to line stomachs. But I say: no! There is something about its modern Spanish, sophisto-tapas menu, its decor and, well, its marketing as a formerly three Michelin-starred chef’s passion project that suggests it should instead feel more like spending a sultry, elegant evening in Madrid, nibbling oxtail brioche and pulpo a la gallega in a genteel, terracotta-tiled room with well-kempt floor staff bearing glugging fish jugs. And the front of house are certainly warm, prompt and full of recommendations about your order and, on the surface at least, the place has the look and feel of a fancy-ish Spanish restaurant. The open kitchen full of harassed-looking chefs is definitely up to something. Our first course, those aforementioned porcini croquettes, were earthy and delicate enough, but they were also lukewarm and uncrunchy. The tiny, slider-style oxtail brioche bun was one of the best dishes we tried, featuring a rich, pulled oxtail stew that had clearly had some serious TLC. On the other hand, the broccolini salad, which we were heavily sold, featured a rather sickly black sesame mayo that I had no urge to wolf down. And the signature tortilla brava was a tepid, sloppy mess, and its brava sauce and mayo topping had gone all Jackson Pollock before it reached the table. And did I mention that the music crept ever louder with every plate? If standards are quite blasé in the kitchen, it’s not entirely surprising, because the food seems secondary here. Due to the noise levels, I missed the finer details of the explanation that came with our huevos rotos: four eggs fried tableside before being mixed into some cooked but now lukewarm chips. As any fool knows, eggs with potatoes is a timeless, winning combo both in the UK and all over Spain, but when you’re confronted with a large, oval plate of underseasoned mush, it feels more like a challenge. Butterflied bream, cooked for rather too long, came with an attractively vivid bell pepper sauce that also lacked seasoning. We rescued it with some lime wedges from another dish. A reportedly caramelised rice pudding was again rather cold, and there had apparently been no attempt to make it enticingly crunchy and bronzed, because it came scattered with raw brown sugar. The chocolate mousse was topped with a thick layer of set chantilly cream, and was the other truly decent dish we had that night. By this point, however, it was pushing 9pm and the noise levels were louder than a nightclub at midnight. This became especially evident when a jolly, young woman at a nearby table kept standing up, waving her arms and heading off to find the dance floor, before being reminded by her companions that she was at dinner and that those were her croquettes. Each time, she sat down thwarted, glum and incarcerated. Here I was in a restaurant that felt like a nightclub, shoving down mousse and desperate to be liberated; and there she was in a nightclub, being forced to eat a full square meal and equally desperate for freedom. Which of us Bibo is aimed at remains a bit of a mystery, but in this instance, I’ll graciously step aside.  Bibo at The Mondrian, 45 Curtain Road, London EC2, 020-3988 4455. Open all week, noon-11pm.

1/7/2022,"One day in Évora, Portugal, my travelling companions and I walked across a square hammered with 40-degree heat. A little delirious, having just visited a chapel decorated with human bones and the hair of young brides, we entered the apparent calm of a shop selling household items. Except our day of the macabre was not over. One of these items was a hat-rack made of four sheep feet, their still-grubby hooves varnished, bent at their joints into L-shapes, and fixed none too elegantly to a moulded piece of wood. I bought it. I held on to it even after it became infested, in the style of a Dalí painting, with ants. I brought it back home to Britain. Only with great reluctance, and under duress from members of my family who found this increasingly dilapidated object for some reason disgusting, did I throw it away. I still mourn it, as if it were a missing limb. Much as a sheep might feel, indeed, whose feet had been made into a hat stand.  But never mind. I can console myself with a bowl made of pine cones from the Taygetos mountains in Greece, a glow-in-the-dark Virgin Mary from a religious shop in Brixton market in London and the Little Lovemaking Monk, an object of extreme bad taste from a joke shop in the Paragon Arcade in Hull. Also models of food of the kind that restaurants in Japan sometimes display in their windows and an ashtray and lighter in the shape of the “Bird’s Nest” stadium built for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. (Which, one imagines, was the last time it was deemed appropriate to sell memorabilia for this sporting festival that were also smokers’ requisites.) Because I write about architecture, it might be thought that I surround myself only with the most refined objects. “Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful,” as William Morris said, “or believe to be beautiful.” Such good advice. Except I don’t follow it: some of the things I live with are definitely useless and some might be considered by many to be ugly. You could call a lot of them kitsch, but that’s a derogatory word for artefacts which, one way or another and with the possible exception of that monk from Hull, deserve respect. What they have in common is their freedom from hierarchies of taste, their unconcern with whether they constitute Design with a capital “D”. The attraction is partly sentimental. These objects can recall a time and place, this or that holiday or work trip, the people I was with, the heat in the air or the smell of the trees, the weight of food or the haze of alcohol, more effectively than a photograph. They are antidotes to globalisation. At a time when similar arrays of brands inhabit the main streets of cities everywhere, it’s a pleasure to find an object that could only come from one place. Some have the power to convey disappeared worlds, such as the Soviet-era postcard books of mountain ranges, baroque palaces or Rubens paintings bought in Tallinn, Estonia. I’m drawn to things that show a desire, a dream or a belief, where you can get a sense of connection with the maker. And with The Maker: most of the world religions are represented in my collection. Many of the pieces are about death or love or hope. I have boxes of soap, made in Argentina and bought in Spain, that carry colourful images suggesting use of the product might encourage a saint to help with school exams and resolve marital strife. I like the preposterous, for example a pop-up cardboard model of the colossal palace that the tyrannical President Ceaușescu built in Bucharest, an object that is made with more delicacy than the building itself. Also the absurd, as with a plastic ashtray carrying a reproduction of Goya’s La Maja desnuda. I admire that someone so fearlessly took the logic of tourist souvenirs – apply an iconic image to an everyday object – to its logical if jarring conclusion. Brought together, these objects reveal the extents to which things are alike and different, the way that a fruit made of felt might chime with one carved from wood, or a metal Turkish clock with the plastic grotto that contains that luminous Virgin, for no other reason that they are the same blue-green colour. There are leaps of scale – a tiny castle, an oversized clock – and thwarted or faded technologies, such as lenticular postcards or clockwork or models of obsolete cars. There’s a preponderance of skeuomorphs in my collection, that it is to say of things that look like something other than what they are. Not that it should really be called a collection, as that might imply more direction than is actually present. An accumulation would be a better word. A sense of connection can come from the way something is made as well as anything it might try to represent. Tiny trees and kitchen units for architectural models, bought at the giant and phenomenal Tokyu Hands department store in Tokyo, bowl you over with their precision. Small enamel coffee cups, deep red from Barcelona and leaf green from Salvador but otherwise identical, have the appeal that comes with doing something simple well. That pine-cone bowl, bought from an old woman in a lonely stall on a mountain road, while not dishwasher-safe, is exquisite. My favourite objects are those where image and making combine. These include the cardboard models of valuable goods that are sometimes burned at Chinese funerals so that, even if some of them become a bit dated, they can be enjoyed in the afterlife: Rolexes, a Walkman, an SLR camera. Both idea and execution are beautiful. I also treasure a swan, made from a plastic milk bottle by the artist Madelon Vriesendorp – who incidentally is a far more accomplished accumulationist than I am – that lights up from inside. All human life, in short, is there. There are thrift, invention, fantasy and extravagance, skill and error, naivety and cleverness. The objects are prompts, distractions and inspirations in my daily life. They manifest intent in material, which is something I am always looking for, whether in a cathedral or a coffee cup.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Weird and wonderful: how to buy objects that bring joy to your home,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/07/weird-and-wonderful-how-to-buy-objects-that-bring-joy-to-your-home
1/7/2022,"We first meet sardonic New Yorker Edie sitting in the office talking dirty on a dating app with a man who says he is in an open marriage. For Edie, who is 23, the product of a difficult childhood and one of only two Black editors at her publishing firm, casual sex is a way to distract herself from her myriad disappointments. And so she begins an affair with the white fortysomething archivist Eric, which is complicated when his wife, Rebecca, decides to get to know her too. When Edie is fired and can no longer afford the rent on her cockroach-infested apartment, Rebecca invites her into the couple’s smart suburban home where they live with their adopted daughter, Akila. This, it appears, is done partly in the hope that Edie will provide guidance for Akila, who is on the brink of adolescence and is the only Black child in their white neighbourhood. American writer Raven Leilani’s debut novel is a dazzling and often uncomfortable exploration of race, class, power and the thankless grind that is being young and broke in the city. Ariel Blake narrates, expertly inhabiting Edie’s knowing and analytical tone, and revelling in the writer’s winding sentences and caustic one-liners. Edie describes Rebecca as “sexy in the way a triangle can be sexy”. At finding herself alone for the first time with Akila, she observes: “There are times when I interact with kids and recall my abortion fondly.” It’s a classic Leilanian line, blending trauma, humour and unblinking candour.

1/7/2022,"Refractive Africa by Will Alexander (Granta, £10.99)This visionary act of “transpersonal witness” to a continent is an Afromodernist epic in the tradition of Kamau Brathwaite’s The Arrivants. It is first of all an act of repossession, as in the opening section’s dialogue with Nigerian novelist Amos Tutuola and closing homage to the Madagascan Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo, often considered Africa’s first modern poet. At the heart of the book is a 50-page poem, The Congo, on that country as a site of colonial pillage, “vertiginous with derangement”. An incantation against “Eurocentric stultification”, Refractive Africa embraces an aesthetic of sprawl and overreach, summoning free-flowing visions of grandeur and desolation. Alexander, an American, is the author of more than 30 books, and his introduction to a British readership is overdue.  The Vulture by Gerard Woodward (Picador, £10.99)We begin with the discovery of a dead vulture at the foot of a cliff; slicing open its belly reveals “nothing in there / but the usual unspeakable things”. Any expectations of dark secrets laid bare in the poems that follow are tempered by a mood of ubiquitous quirkiness. Describing a piano stool, Woodward writes of its “black wood, as though the piano had calved”, a comparison that could be on day release from Craig Raine’s A Martian Sends a Postcard Home. He prefers his imagery poised and metaphysical: “scholarly, they held / seminars, conferences”, he says of some frogs. More memorable are the narratives of buildings and family histories in the book’s second half, such as Chinoiserie and Paraffin. These poems are at their best when they “come up against something solid”. Duino Elegies by Rainer Maria Rilke, translated by Vita and Edward Sackville-West (Pushkin, £14.99)The Sackville-Wests’ translation of the Duino Elegies is reissued for the first time in 90 years. Edward Sackville-West was a gifted linguist, and his cousin Vita “had the assistance of her latest lover”, as we learn from the introduction (not Woolf). What sank their Rilke was their insistence on parcelling him into blank verse, smoothing out so much that should have been spiky. Chumminess is also a factor: “Every angel is redoubtable,” begins the second elegy here, as though we are dealing with a doughty old dinner-party guest rather than a supernatural emanation. This is a fascinating slice of unselfconscious Georgianism in a world that, even in 1931, had dramatically moved on. Litanies by Naush Sabah (Guillemot, £8)This is a book of faith and doubt, of roots and rejections. “Slay the messengers, the oracles, the gods and diviners,” Sabah declares, in poems that shake off outgrown beliefs while finding the language of belief rather harder to discard. Theistic fatalism is a source of anguish: “if she lives / they’ll praise God’s mercy,” we read in Litany of the Shoreline, a poem on a child’s illness; but “if she dies / they’ll praise God for his mercy.” The sensory ecstasies of Questions of Faith provide a daring counterpoint (“love was all I believed in ask me one more time about my faith”). Sabah has something of Thomas Hardy’s bittersweet dialogue with the divine, his eye for the disappointments and betrayals of love, in what are poems of huge emotional courage. Already well known as an editor, Sabah’s blossoming as a poet is a spectacle to behold. Pilgrim Bell by Kaveh Akbar (Chatto & Windus, £12.99)“When I saw God / I trembled like a man I used the wrong pronouns.” Where Sabah’s poems proceed from the sacred towards the secular, Akbar’s move from a default secularism back towards the language of the sacred. The epigraph reads “Any text that is not a holy text is an apostasy”, a line suggestive of Blakean ecstasies but also the force of a more exclusivist faith. Akbar’s way of processing this is studied vulnerability, as in Reza’s Restaurant, Chicago, 1997, or The Value of Fear (“The value // of joy is in its / asking, what now shall I repair?”). “Art is where what we survive survives”; these are poems on the grand scale, staging dramas of cosmic light and dark.",Arts/Books,The best recent poetry – reviews roundup,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/07/the-best-recent-poetry-reviews-roundup
1/7/2022,"From colour-shifting cars to digital art TVs and stress-predicting watches, the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, which opened on Wednesday, offered its usual mix of wacky, visionary and desirable goods. Here are some of the highlights.  The non fungible token, which confers ownership of a unique digital item such as a work of art, became a multi-billion dollar market in 2021 and Samsung announced a new TV feature that allows enthusiasts to browse, display and buy NFT-based art. Given how much some NFTs cost, you may not have much left over to pay for the screen. Nowatch has produced a smartwatch that monitors your cortisol levels to predict stress. Developed with the electronics firm Philips, the watch predicts if you are about to become stressed an hour in advance and recommends activities to avoid that, such as going for a walk or meditating. Running out of interconnected home products? A lightbulb that tracks your body temperature and heart rate using a combination of radar technology and artificial intelligence was unveiled by the Shanghai-based maker of smart bulbs, Sengled. The bulb connects to a smartphone app and its colours change if it detects anything amiss. Sengled says its Smart Health Monitoring Light can even detect falls. Germany’s Bosch presented the Spexor, an 11.9cm-high (4.7in) device that monitors air pressure, noise and motion to detect break-ins. It can also measure air quality and temperature. The immersive world of the metaverse – the wooly concept of working and socialising in virtual reality – was given a sensory boost by the Japanese firm Shiftall, which has produced the PebbleFeel device that straps to a user’s back and allows them to experience the temperature of the VR environment they are exploring. It was demonstrated alongside Shiftall’s HaritoraX full body motion-tracking system, which allows users’ avatars – their digital representation in VR – to lie down, jump and spin around. The Noveto N1 soundbar transmits music through ultrasound to “pockets” just outside a user’s left and right ear, giving the effect of wearing headphones, even though no head-based hardware is involved. The Israeli company says other people in the room will hear a “whisper” of sound only. CES is also a big event for the automotive industry, which likes to show off its cutting-edge advances alongside the usual displays from mobile phone makers, TV set manufacturers and big tech players. BMW, for instance, unveiled a concept car that, thanks to an external wrap filled with electronic ink, was able to shift colour from white to black at the touch of a button. John Deere unveiled a self-driving tractor that can be controlled by smartphone and plough and sow seeds in a straight line. It plans to make the self-driving system available to a small number of farmers later this year. Mercedes-Benz produced a prototype electric car with a range of more than 1,000km, approximately a drive from Brighton on England’ south coast to Inverness in the Scottish Highlands. The Vision EQXX, whose range is three times longer than that of the average electric car, could go on sale in 2024.",News/Technology,Invisible headphones to chameleon cars: standout tech from CES 2022,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/07/invisible-headphones-to-chameleon-cars-standout-tech-from-ces-2022
1/7/2022,"Lawyers for Bob Dylan have formally denied allegations of child sexual abuse made against him in a lawsuit from an anonymous woman filed in August 2021. The lawsuit claims that Dylan groomed the woman, referred to as JC, when she was 12 years old and sexually abused her. Dylan, it is claimed, aimed to “lower her inhibitions with the object of sexually abusing her, which he did, coupled with the provision of drugs, alcohol and threats of physical violence, leaving her emotionally scarred and psychologically damaged to this day”.  JC originally alleged that the abuse took place over a six-week period in 1965, including at New York’s Chelsea Hotel. Last week, the lawsuit was amended to state that the alleged abuse took place over “several months”. Dylan’s legal team have responded to the amendment with a filing of their own, calling the lawsuit “a brazen shakedown … false, malicious, reckless and defamatory”. It goes on: “Mr Dylan will not be extorted. Mr Dylan will vigorously defend himself against these lawyer-driven lies and seek redress against all those responsible, including by seeking monetary sanctions against persons responsible for manufacturing and bringing this abusive lawsuit.” They claim that JC “told a very different story about her alleged interactions with Mr Dylan to a journalist, Mr Daryl Sanders, in 2017”, and attempt to discredit JC by highlighting her work as a psychic. JC’s lawyer Peter Gleason responded, saying: “Neither my client or her counsel are going to be bullied. More than half of Americans believe in psychic phenomena. If you’re going to attack somebody for their beliefs, you’re encroaching upon very dangerous territory. This is what this country is based on, freedom of beliefs. It shouldn’t divert our attention from the allegations. This case is about the facts.” Her allegations, including the new timeframe, are also described by Dylan’s lawyers as a “chronological impossibility”, something also claimed by others in the wake of the initial filing. The music writer Clinton Heylin said it was “not possible” that Dylan was in New York for long enough during the initial alleged timeframe, saying that the singer was in England, Los Angeles and Woodstock in rural New York. Another lawyer for JC said in August that Dylan’s itinerary was “not inconsistent with our client’s claims. There are dates that he wasn’t touring for several weeks in April and this will all come out at that appropriate time. The claims were vetted before the case was filed and we did our research. It’s our position that the evidence will establish that he was in New York during the relevant time period.” No hearing date has yet been set for the case.",Arts/Music,Bob Dylan’s lawyers call child sexual abuse lawsuit ‘false and malicious’,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/07/bob-dylan-lawyers-abuse-lawsuit
1/7/2022,"Rooney Mara is set to play Audrey Hepburn in a new biopic of the Breakfast at Tiffany’s actor. The film will be directed by Luca Guadagnino, the Italian director best known for the Oscar-nominated Call Me By Your Name, as well as for A Bigger Splash and his remake of Suspiria. It will be written by Michael Mitnick, who collaborated with Guadagnino on 2019 short The Staggering Girl, and who also has a biopic about Jim Henson in production.  Hepburn’s elegant performances in films such as Roman Holiday, Sabrina and My Fair Lady, coupled with her iconic image, have meant she has remained in the public consciousness for almost 30 years since her death in 1993, aged 63. Born in 1929 to a Dutch baroness and a British diplomat, she spent much of her adolescence under Nazi occupation in the Netherlands under an assumed Dutch name, fearful of appearing English. However, she also performed in dance recitals to fundraise for the resistance and transferred messages in her ballet shoes. After training as a dancer, she was spotted in 1950 on a beach in Monaco by the French author Colette, who cast her as the lead in the Broadway transfer of her novella Gigi. Two years later, Hepburn won an Oscar, a Bafta and a Golden Globe for Roman Holiday, beginning a remarkably successful screen career – from which she largely retired 14 years later, to raise her family and work for Unicef. Mara, 36, was Oscar-nominated for her role in Todd Haynes’s romance Carol, and also starred in David Fincher’s remake of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Lion, Her and Mary Magdalene.",Arts/Film,Rooney Mara set to play Audrey Hepburn in new biopic,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/07/rooney-mara-audrey-hepburn-biopic-luca-guadagnino
1/7/2022,"Jonny Bairstow said it would have been nice if the supporters who were thrown out for abusing him at tea had still been there at stumps when he walked off the field basking in the afterglow of his toughest Test century to date. The 32-year-old lit up the third day in Sydney with an unbeaten 103 that, along with a bristling 66 from Ben Stokes, took England to 258 for seven, avoided the follow-on and raised hopes of the tourists preventing a series whitewash at 3-0 down.  As well as gritting his teeth after a nasty blow to the thumb from Pat Cummins, Bairstow also blocked out comments from one rowdy supporter in the member’s stand who shouted: “Take your jumper off Bairstow, lose some weight Bairstow, you’re fat.” Bairstow fired back with “Pal, that’s right just turn around and walk away,” before his abuser and two others were ejected. Ultimately, the best riposte came through his work out in the middle, cracking eight fours and three sixes to deliver the first century of England’s sorry tour and his seventh in Test cricket. “I’m over the moon to be honest,” said Bairstow. “That was the hardest one so far I think, under the circumstances. We put the graft in, that partnership [of 128 runs] with Ben Stokes was a big one. It was tough out there and I’m really delighted with it.” Asked about his earlier exchange of verbals with the fan, Bairstow replied: “It was a bit of bad-mouthing. It’s not needed. We’re out there trying to do our jobs, people are there enjoying the cricket. Unfortunately, sometimes people overstep the mark. “I think it is important to stand up for ourselves because if we are not standing up for ourselves, you can cop it. When people overstep the mark, they need to be told. It would have been nice if they had been there giving it when we walked off at the end. Unfortunately, they weren’t and they missed the end of a fantastic day’s Test cricket.” Bairstow’s thumb problem follows Jos Buttler injuring his left index finger in the field on day two. With Stokes suffering from a side strain, Sam Billings has been drafted in from the Big Bash League to bolster the squad and could be set for a Test debut if neither Buttler not Bairstow are fit to keep wicket in the day-night finale in Hobart. Billings, who was due to play in the T20 series in the Caribbean that starts later this month, has now begun an isolation period at the team hotel. And on the third day Ollie Pope was undergoing wicket-keeping drills in the nets in anticipation of being required to come on as a substitute gloveman when Australia’s second innings gets under way. Asked about his own injury, one of a number of similar blows to England’s batters as the Sydney pitch played tricks, Bairstow replied: “It takes quite a bit to get me off the park. Yes, it was sore but the circumstances of the game, it was one of those where it was a decision I made to stay out there. “The medics can give you advice but you’re playing in an Ashes Test match, a New Year’s Day Pink Test match at Sydney in front of a big crowd. It’s going to take a lot to get you away from that.”",Sport/Sport,‘Sometimes people overstep the mark’: Bairstow hits back at abusive fans,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/07/jonny-bairstow-disappointed-abusive-fans-did-not-see-his-ashes-century
1/7/2022,"Unsuk Chin’s first violin concerto was premiered 20 years ago. It won her the prestigious Grawemeyer award in 2004, and brought her music to an international audience. Chin had decided not to write another violin concerto, preferring to explore other instrumental combinations, but then encountered the playing of Leonidas Kavakos, which suggested to her an entirely fresh way of approaching the form. The result is her new work for violin and orchestra, subtitled Scherben der Stille (Shards of Silence); it was co-commissioned by the London Symphony Orchestra, which got to give the first performance; Kavakos naturally was the soloist, with Simon Rattle conducting. Chin describes the new concerto as “a subjective portrait of and a dialogue with Leonidas Kavakos’s musicianship”. It’s a single movement lasting around 25 minutes, and cast as a series of often roughly juxtaposed episodes (the “shards” of the subtitle) which develop from the thematic kernel of repeated string-crossing harmonics with which the unaccompanied violin begins the work. The solo writing is strenuously demanding – Kavakos seemed totally at ease with every one of its challenges – while the LSO relished all the usual glitter and playful fizz of Chin’s sound world. But this time there seems to be an undertow of deep seriousness to the brilliance too, which sometimes takes the music in unexpectedly dark directions.  After the premiere Rattle paired two works that were both completed in 1924, but which could hardly be more different. His account of Sibelius’s Seventh Symphony seemed less stark and implacable, less forbidding perhaps, than many interpretations, but it was imposing all the same, and not as self-consciously moulded as some of his other recent Sibelius performances. In Bartók’s Miraculous Mandarin (the truncated “suite” from the ballet, rather than the complete work, alas), the orchestra revelled in the score’s vivid imagery: Bartók at his most aggressively dissonant. Some passages could perhaps have been sexier, others more violent, but it was all hugely impressive.

1/7/2022,"It has been a bittersweet experience watching the final seven episodes of Pen15 (available on Sky Comedy and Now in the UK and Hulu in the US), the cringe-inducing high-school comedy that sees thirtysomething comics Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle play 13-year-old versions of themselves (amid a cast of actual teens). The show is as brilliant and bracing as ever, full of adolescent angst, absurdist humour and the occasional moment of devastating drama. But until these episodes arrived, there was no indication that they would be the show’s last.  When that news broke, the assumption was that Pen15 – a little-watched if critically beloved comedy – had been cancelled, but that wasn’t the case: Erskine and Konkle have both just had children and have tons of other commitments (Erskine is in the upcoming Obi-Wan Kenobi series; Konkle is writing a memoir), so were conscious of burning out, and – crucially – felt that they had told their characters’ story. Still, it’s hard not to feel like Pen15 has gone too soon. This is a pretty common feeling these days. The promise of the streaming revolution was that you would get more of what you wanted, when you wanted – and the expectation was that that would extend to shows getting to tell their stories over as many series as required. After all, one of Netflix’s earliest moves was to revive the beloved and prematurely cancelled show Arrested Development (a move that didn’t go so well). In actuality, though, the length of a series in the streaming age tends to be pretty short. Really, we should have seen this coming: streaming platforms – with their algorithmic models predicated on figuring out who is watching their content where, when and why – were always likely to make ruthless decisions on when to cut a show loose. Indeed Netflix has been particularly brutal in this regard (Glow, we hardly knew thee). But Pen15 illustrates another reason that shows aren’t sticking around for long: the talent. Creating TV, particularly in an age where quite a few shows resemble blockbuster movies in their scope and budget, is an intense, laborious experience, so the old model of series trundling on into their sixth, seventh or eighth year hardly feels fit for purpose (it is hard at this point to imagine a show like Succession, so operatically full-on every week, being able to maintain that intensity for another five or six years). And, of course, these days TV has become a desirable place for Hollywood A-listers, whose schedules – not to mention salaries – don’t chime terribly well with multi-series epics. That is why, in the past half decade or so, we have witnessed the rise of the limited or mini series: self-contained stories that get told within a tight 10 episodes or fewer. A superstar such as Kate Winslet can take on Mare of Easttown knowing that she isn’t signing her life away to a multi-series show. And it’s also why there has been an increase in anthology shows such as American Crime Story or Black Mirror, with a different cast every series or even episode. Brevity has its benefits, too: attracting a higher calibre of talent (take Barry Jenkins directing all 10 episodes of The Underground Railroad), and allowing its creators to tell ambitious, tightly constructed stories, with none of the wheel-spinning or forced cliffhangers that a longer, baggier show might necessitate. Such programmes don’t outstay their welcome. Strikingly, of the top three shows on the Guardian’s best TV of 2021 list, two were limited series (Mare of Easttown, It’s a Sin) and one was an anthology series (The White Lotus, whose second season will have a different setting and cast, including – excitingly – The Sopranos’ Michael Imperioli). Still, it is hard not to feel a pang of regret for the TV that we have lost: those vast, “novelistic” series like The Sopranos and The Wire, aren’t gone necessarily, but they’re certainly harder to get made. (Although we should note that on US “network” TV, the never-ending show is still the model, in the form of procedurals such as CSI or comedies such as The Simpsons). And it’s hard not to feel sadness too for the shows that disappeared right as they seemed to be hitting their stride. I personally could have watched … oh, another 15 series of Pen15.

1/7/2022,"As we age, some things fade, while others take on greater significance. It’s a line that sounds lifted from a Call the Midwife voiceover, but as the new year begins, it also strikes me as true. For the first time this year, I’m aware of a shift in emphasis, from Christmas Day itself – a pain of logistics and expectation management – to the period directly afterwards. Specifically, an occasion that before now I’ve never felt to be any such thing: the taking down of the tree.  I bought our tree three years ago from Bed Bath & Beyond. It was $39.99 and came loaded with the kind of lights that, twinkling magically and extremely brightly, caused me to blurt out “bad wiring” and “house fire” every time I walked past. On Sunday night, while my children pottered around engaged with their new presents, I started slowly to remove the ornaments. I untangled the tinsel. I removed the listing star. As I did so, I caught myself in one of those unnerving moments in which you can feel time as an almost material property. For a second, I saw the scene as through a telescope backwards. How much longer would the magic of Christmas hold? How soon would this stage of childhood evaporate? How definitive the dismantling of a large object in my living room felt, the physical manifestation of another year passing. Some of this nostalgia was down to the decorations. We lean heavily on the homemade: the wonky angel from nursery school, already an echo of a distant past, along with the loo roll penguin and the glitter art. Six days after Christmas, my children turned seven – as a friend in Paris pointed out, the beginning of the age of reason. Six seemed to be running on the last vapours of toddlerhood. Seven is a different proposition entirely. With the care of one handling the crown jewels, I laid the decorations in Tupperware and covered them in tissue. “Why do you look like that?” said a child, crossly. God forbid anyone should have a moment of internal privacy in this house. “It’s my thinking face,” I snapped. On we go. Climbing into a cab in the pouring rain, in the middle of Broadway with a bus behind us, is a stressful business without my kids operating at quarter speed. “Hurry up, you guys are so slow,” I say, as they ease their way into the car and I continue to stand in the traffic. “That’s so mean!” says my daughter, when we’re finally in. “You tipped my bucket.” Are you aware of this? The bucket philosophy of childhood emotional welfare? It’s a thing. In schools in the US, or at least in our corner of New York, emotions are buckets. Or wait. The child is the bucket and you, the adult, are responsible for filling or tipping it. That could be wrong. “Explain the bucket thing to me again?” I say. She gives me a look of disdain, like I could study this for the rest of my life and still never grasp it. When children do well at at school, they are issued “bucket tickets”, like the gold stars of yore but with a prize at the end and an extra level of frisson because buckets can also be emptied. “You called me slow and that’s mean and it tipped my bucket,” she says. But I’m not wearing this one. “It would only be mean if you were incapable of going faster,” I say. “Are you saying you are literally incapable of going any faster when I ask you to?” Yes. That’s exactly what she’s saying. What a gift on a gloomy Wednesday is Novak Djokovic, not merely barred from the Australian Open, but barred after taking an 18-hour flight from Dubai, then held overnight at Melbourne airport. Never mind that his treatment was a result of a dithering U-turn by the Australian government. It looked, for all the world, like a piece of top-class trolling and correspondents on Australian TV could hardly contain their delight. A day earlier, the Serbian world No 1 and vaccine-sceptic had smugly tweeted “today I’m heading Down Under with an exemption permission” – that is, special dispensation to enter Australia and play in the Open, despite being unvaccinated, and causing sufficient fury among Australians for Scott Morrison to jump. At the 11th hour, the country’s border force cancelled Djokovic’s visa and after keeping him in the airport, moved him to another venue. Or as his mother, speaking at a press conference in Belgrade and ably demonstrating where her son gets his charm, summarised the week’s events, Australia was “keeping him a prisoner” in “some small immigration hotel”. The new mayor of New York, Eric Adams, has been showing off since his inauguration five days ago, culminating in the moment mid-week when he slides down a firefighter’s pole in Queens. (One tries to imagine Bill de Blasio doing this and concludes it would be worse than that scene from the first Bridget Jones.) Hard on the heels of the pole slide, Adams displays a strapped finger at a press conference, which when questioned about he says is an injury sustained after shaking a police officer’s hand too vigorously. Adams, an eccentric figure who was busted before Christmas for abandoning his car in the middle of the street, to emerge from his house hours later and coolly drive up the pavement in avoidance of the traffic chaos he himself had caused, suddenly seems a delightful prospect for the next four years, with a pinch of that old Ed Koch showmanship. He certainly knows how to spin a line. Stand by, in coming weeks, for Adams to throw his back out bowing his head at the 9/11 memorial, get laryngitis from over-reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, and wear an RSI wrist guard after too-enthusiastically saluting the flag. The weather in New York is bananas. It was 15C last weekend for new year; mid-week it dipped to -5. Today there’s snow. I drive through it to a garage to return a rental car. Renting a car in the city can cost more than staying in a hotel, with an invoice full of add-ons that make less sense than a cable bill. Through incompetence, impatience and an inability to decode the fine print, I manage to gift the rental firm half a tank of petrol. This happens every time. It’s really tipping my bucket.",News/UK news,Dismantling my tree left me haunted by the ghosts of Christmases past | Digested week,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/07/digested-week-dismantling-tree-ghosts-christmas-past
1/7/2022,"The organic food retailer Riverford has increased the price of its veg boxes by 5% as costs, including wages and transport, soar “across the board”. The Devon-based company told its customers that after holding its prices for two years, widespread cost pressures meant “reluctantly, we need to increase our prices”.  Riverford delivers 80,000 veg boxes a week and this week’s changes mean a small seasonal veg box now costs 60p more, at £13.25, while a large fruit and veg delivery has risen £1.20 to £24.75. The increase is the latest example of the cost of living squeeze hitting UK households as food and energy bills increase. Figures released on Wednesday from the supermarket analysts Kantar put grocery price inflation last month at 3.5%. Rob Haward, Riverford’s managing director, said putting up its prices would enable it to ensure everyone in its supply chain was being treated fairly. The company has been employee-owned since 2018. “The two biggest costs for us are pay for our co-owners who grow, pick, pack and deliver, and the prices we pay for fruit and veg from our farmers and growers,” he said. Riverford workers received a pay rise of more than 8% in the autumn, while the prices paid to growers would rise about 5% this season, Ward said. “Our growers and farmers need this to cover the increasing costs of labour and fuel, and to reinvest in the farm.” He also pointed to other cost pressures, with packaging up 6% and haulage up 10%. “This would probably all be OK for us as a business if it was short-lived but we expect all these costs to continue, so we had no choice but to reflect them in our prices.” Shoppers have turned to the home delivery services offered by companies such as Riverford in big numbers since the coronavirus pandemic began. Sales of its veg boxes have increased from 50,000 a week at the start of 2020 to between 80,000 and 85,000 today, propelling its turnover to £76m. Jack Ward, the chief executive of the British Growers Association, said the backdrop of steep cost increases, particularly for labour on hand-harvested crops, was starting to affect growers’ confidence. “People are saying: ‘We’re just going to cut back this year because we’re not sure we can get the staff we need to harvest the full extent of what we’d originally planned,’” he said. “I think everyone is expecting prices in the shops to go up. There is a general issue now between how we reconcile the competing demands from consumers for static pricing and funding the cost of production where the costs are not static, they are increasing.”",News/Business,Riverford raises price of veg boxes as costs soar ‘across the board’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/07/riverford-raises-price-veg-boxes-costs-soar-across-the-board
1/7/2022,"In 1970s Paris, Betty Catroux and her husband, François, were the glittering couple at the heart of French high society and what used to be known as the international jet set. She was the androgynous model and darling of the French designer Yves Saint Laurent, he the self-taught interior decorator who transformed the mansions, grand apartments and chateaux of the super-rich or royal, among them the Rothschilds, Diane von Furstenberg and, later, Roman Abramovich.  At Chez Régine nightclub, the celebrated venue on the rue de Ponthieu, the towering 6ft Betty and her husband, described by one friend as having the air of “a Riviera playboy”, held court with the likes of Andy Warhol, Salvador Dalí, Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, or visiting Hollywood stars such as Audrey Hepburn and Ava Gardner. When the partying ended, the Catroux returned home, often in one of his expensive sports cars. And their ultimate homecoming was to be to a superb apartment in the former Maeterlinck Palace overlooking the Baie des Anges on the French Riviera at Nice, where François had decided he would end his days. It was a best-laid plan; tragically the Côte d’Azur flat, a personal culmination of his life’s work and designed entirely for him and his wife, was barely completed when Catroux discovered he had cancer. He died in November 2020. Now the entire contents of the property, in which the couple are said to have spent only a handful of nights, are to be sold off in a single auction as a tribute to the discreet designer often hailed as one of the most influential decorators of the 21st century. François Catroux, born in Algeria, was the grandson of the Gen Georges Catroux, a distinguished military hero who met Charles de Gaulle while in captivity in Germany during the first world war and joined the Free French in London during the second. As a boy, Catroux was a pupil at the same Roman Catholic boarding school in Oran as Saint Laurent, who later became his close friend. He was living in New York, working as a journalist for Elle magazine writing about luxury apartments, when the Italian fashion queen Mila Schön asked him to design her Milan showroom. The result, a laminate spaceship, caused a storm worldwide and put the 30-year-old Catroux on the design map. As an interior designer, Catroux started with the staples of sixties design, Plexiglas and steel – but quickly moved to natural materials, wood, leather and cotton, mixing the modern and comfortable with traditional furniture and art. While largely unknown to the general public, he quickly became the decorator of choice for aristocrats, royals and the super wealthy. He earned plaudits for mixing old, such as the Rothschild’s 17th century tapestries, paintings by the masters and heritage furniture, with modern designs of his own invention. For Von Furstenberg, a longtime friend, and her husband, Barry Diller, he designed houses in Los Angeles and Connecticut, as well as the interior of their luxury yacht. He met Betty, whom he described as a “living mannequin” for YSL, when she sent him a drink in Régines, where she also met Saint Laurent. The couple married in 1968. The Belgian designer Anthony Vaccarello, now the creative director of Saint Laurent, told the New York Times: “Betty likes to say she was the bipolar double of Saint Laurent, which is a chic and elusive way of expressing their twinning. Through her, he was able to give life to his vision. Thanks to him, she was able to become herself.” The sale of the contents of the couple’s Riviera home, overseen by Sotheby’s, includes about 100 lots reflecting François Catroux’s personal taste, including contemporary artworks and items from Asia and Africa, as well as some of his own creations. Florent Jeanniard, European head of design and vice-president of Sotheby’s France, said the Catroux’s home was an “unmatched setting”. “Here, works by great contemporary artists and cutting-edge designers mingled with timeless antiques that the decorator treasured for his entire life. He loved this place and it suited him,” he said. Jeanniard added: “Everything you see inside the apartment is up for sale. The amazing thing is that this sublime place is Catroux … it was his last great work. “François wanted to end his days in the sun so they bought this apartment and he designed everything in it. This place and everything in it is François Catroux’s universe. It was almost finished when he became ill so they never lived there apart from a few nights. After he died, it became too painful for Betty to go there, so the family has decided to sell it. “Catroux was best known in France and the United States where he had many clients, but was not a well-known name to many people. However, he was without doubt one of the most important decorators of the 21st century and we believe this sale will be a tribute to him.”  The François and Betty Catroux collection goes on sale at Sotheby’s, Paris on 24 February.",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘Unmatched’: contents of 70s French power couple’s final bolthole up for auction,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/07/contents-of-70s-french-power-couple-final-bolthole-up-for-auction-betty-francois-catroux
