5/18/2022,"“‘My name is Yip Tolroy & I am mute. I have made not a sound since the day of my birth, October 2nd, 1815.” So begins Paddy Crewe’s ambitious, cinematic debut novel set during Georgia’s gold rush in a semi-mythic American south that recalls both Cormac McCarthy’s All the Pretty Horses and Faulkner’s Light in August. Purporting to be the written account of Yip’s adventures narrated from the comfort of later life, it explores a society in flux, one about to turn its back on religion and embrace greed and individualism. It’s also a rollicking, page-turning wild west adventure, populated by a cast of arresting grotesques, with luminous imagery and an unforgettable protagonist. When Yip’s father mysteriously disappears, his fierce, gun-toting mother opens Tolroy’s Store in Heron’s Creek and sets her son to work. At 14, he’s just 4ft tall and hairless, from what we assume to be alopecia. The pain of his mutism is well expressed in affecting arias: “How can a man live without his voice, O this was the question what begun to haunt my every waking & sleeping minute.” His future looks bleak until a retired doctor teaches him to read and gives him a slate on which to write. This single means of communication is the tool that emancipates Yip, one that travels with him through his picaresque adventures after he embarks on a disastrous night expedition prospecting for gold: “I too turned my heart away from God & took a turn down the Road to Ruin.” Rescued from drowning by the lanky Dud Carter, Yip is forced to leave town when he kills a stranger in a drunken brawl. Thus begins an epic fugitive journey across the American frontier on his trusty horse Gussie, with only Dud for company. It’s here that Crewe’s powers of evoking landscape and character really begin to soar, with Melvillian prose full of striking unexpected phrases. There are compound words (“creekmuck”, “foodstrewn”, “bloodslick”), and scattered coins on a road shining “like the wavetips of the rolling moonstruck ocean”; there are men with “beards ambered with drops of liquor”, and trees “with their old bones & their old bark-rough tongues”, full of the “sump-throated cries” of crows. Later, after Yip is separated from Dud, he’s gathered under the wing of the roguish Jim Coyne, travelling onwards in his wagon. It takes a while to realise he’s been recruited into a freak show, with attractions such as the Pig Faced Lady and queasily sexualised identical twin girls the Living Dolls. Yip is forced to appear in a cage, into which punters pour drink and abuse, only to be rescued once again by Dud. But can Yip get back to Heron’s Creek, claim his gold, avenge his father and be reunited with his mother? These questions make for a tense third act. Here we feel there’s something of Dickens’s orphaned heroes in Yip, a young man who tangles with society’s evils, but has the potential to come good. For Yip read Pip. Occasionally, the folksy tone veers into self-parody (“These is strange flames, said she, these is strange flames”), and a couple of opportunities to explore the big moral issues of the day – slavery and the treatment of Native Americans – are missed. After Yip is briefly held captive by an escaped slave he eventually sees him and his sister “hanging from the cottonwood … twisting & swaying in the morning breeze”. There’s little further comment on this horrific image. Later, when he encounters the Cherokee Onacona, their relationship is frustratingly short-lived: “The face of the old Indian always seemed to tell a tale I could not read … I hope he was not drove away like many.” These quibbles aside, My Name Is Yip is a remarkably vivid and energetic debut novel; a consummate linguistic performance made all the more extraordinary by the fact that its author is from Stockton-on-Tees rather than Atlanta, Georgia.  Jude Cook’s novel Jacob’s Advice is published by Unbound. My Name Is Yip by Paddy Crewe is published by Doubleday (£14.99). To support the Guardian and the Observer buy a copy at guardianbokshop.com.

5/18/2022,"Workers at a Target store in Christiansburg, Virginia, have filed for a union election and, if successful, the store would be the first store belonging to the giant retail chain to unionize in the US. Target has long opposed unionization within its stores, with anti-union videos to discourage workers from unionizing, and earlier this year Target training documents for managers to prevent unionization within stores were leaked. Target has already reportedly pushed back on the union organizing effort in Virginia, trying to use union dues as a tactic to deter workers from supporting the union. But workers at Target are seeking to capitalize on a surging energy in the US labor movement after recent union victories at dozens of Starbucks stores and the first Amazon warehouse in the US. The last union election to be held at a Target store in the US was on Long Island, New York in 2011, where workers voted 137 to 85 against unionizing with the United Food and Commercial Workers. An administrative law judge ruled in 2012 that during the union organizing campaign at that store, Target violated labor law by interrogating and threatening workers over their unionizing efforts and the union election results were overturned by the National Labor Relations Board in 2013, but the UFCW opted against rerunning the election due to long delays. A pharmacy department at a Target store in Brooklyn, New York, became the first to unionize at Target in 2015, joining the UFCW, but Target sold off their pharmacy business to CVS shortly after the election win. In 2018, another Target store on Long Island, New York, voted against unionizing. Adam Ryan, who has worked at the Target store in Christiansburg, Virginia, for five years, founded Target Workers Unite in 2018, after organizing a strike against an abusive manager in 2017. Ryan and his coworkers recently decided to collect union authorization cards to formally submit a union election petition to the National Labor Relations Board after he says Target corporate and management ignored their petition to enact seniority pay, specifically a $2 an hour increase for workers with five years at the company and an additional $2 an hour for workers with 10 or more years at Target. The workers are affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World as a bargaining representative, while remaining independent in their organizing efforts. “It just came to a point where coworkers said, well, this is just a waste of time. They’re just having us going in circles and not giving us an answer,” said Ryan. “They’re not legally obligated to have to talk to us or provide a yes answer to this petition, even though they tell us they have an open door policy, but there is a way that we can force them to the negotiating table, through collective bargaining.” The workers collected over 30% of the required support through union authorization signature cards to file a petition for a union election and submitted it after their request for voluntary union recognition from Target received no response. A hearing is currently scheduled for 1 June to determine the size of the bargaining unit ahead of the election, which Ryan predicts Target will use to try to delay and stall an election date, a tactic that Starbucks attempted several times at the first few stores that filed for union elections. Ryan also explained that Target’s frequent responses to worker complaints has been to cite that wages of workers range from $15 to $24 an hour, with benefits and a tuition program, but argued the tuition program is limited, that he doesn’t know anyone at Target making $24 an hour, and that the benefits that he is supposed to qualify for are virtually non-existent. “I average about 25 hours a week and I’ve always had open availability and requested more than that,” said Ryan, who argued he’s received no paid time off aside from maybe a couple hours here and there in his five years at Target. A spokesperson for Target said in a statement in response to the union election filing, “At Target, our team members are at the heart of our strategy and success, and we have a deep commitment to listening to our team and creating an environment of mutual trust where every team member’s voice matters.” They added: “We want all team members to be better off for working at Target, and years of investments in our culture of care, industry-leading starting wage range of $15 to $24 per hour, expanded health care benefits, debt-free education assistance, personalized scheduling and opportunities for growth have been essential to helping our team members build rewarding careers.”",News/US news,Virginia Target workers seek to unionize amid surge in labor organizing efforts,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/18/target-workers-virginia-seek-to-unionize
5/18/2022,"ANorwegian housing estate becomes the village of the damned in this icily brilliant supernatural tale from film-maker Eskil Vogt, who as a screenwriter is known for his collaborations with Joachim Trier; rather amazingly, his movie before this brutal chiller was their co-scripted romantic comedy The Worst Person in the World. As for The Innocents, it might yet become a scary-movie classic: it greased my palms with anxiety and incidentally has some of the best child acting I have ever seen. See it now before Hollywood comes along and messes up your perception with a dodgy remake. (Having said which, Steven Spielberg or Brian De Palma might well have been interested in this script in their younger days, or maybe even now.) Vogt places us in a pleasant, if featureless residential development in Romsås, Oslo, with 60s-style high-rise buildings near an artificial lake and picturesque woodland. Ida (played by newcomer Rakel Lenora Fløttum) is a moody nine-year-old who resents her mum and dad paying so much attention to her elder sister Anna (Alva Brynsmo Ramstad), who is autistic. As the long hot summer drags on, Ida is left to play outside, and tasked with looking after Anna. But Ida leaves her sister alone on the swings one day while she goes off with a new friend: a boy called Ben (Sam Ashraf) who shows her a strange mental trick he can do, making a bottle cap fly through the air without touching it. He also has a nasty predilection for torturing animals. Meanwhile, Anna strikes up a friendship with a girl called Aisha (Mina Yasmin Bremseth Asheim), who has telepathic powers to match Ben’s telekinesis. Aisha starts silently communicating in her mind with Anna, who – to her parents’ overjoyed astonishment – is now able to speak, thanks to her new friend. But these superpowers, revealed as calmly and frankly as if in some social-realist drama, become forces for evil. There is something compelling and even shocking about Ida’s first reaction to Ben’s bottle-cap trick: her sudden, fierce grin of pleasure and excitement. It is almost unearthly. These children are not innocent, and yet there is something pristine in their seclusion from adulthood; like the children in this film’s namesake from 1961, based on Henry James’s ghost story The Turn of the Screw, their world is a secret from the grownups. I also found myself thinking of English TV dramatist Dennis Potter. With a story such as this, it is tempting to find it legible only as metaphor: to decide that Ida, Anna, Ben and Aisha’s existence is a parable for abuse, family dysfunction or racism (it is the two young people of colour who have the powers, at least initially.) Vogt’s script for Trier’s 2017 film Thelma, with its telekinesis theme, is obviously amenable to metaphorical readings. But perhaps this film’s force comes from the fact that there is no other level to find in it. They simply have these supernatural abilities, it is something to do with their being children, and that is all there is to it. The final “duel” scene, taking place in almost complete silence and under the nose of the notionally competent adults, is a masterpiece of sorts. The Innocents is a nightmare unfolding in cold, clear daylight.  The Innocents is released on 20 May in cinemas and on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,The Innocents review – icily brilliant tale of kids with supernatural powers is future classic,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/18/the-innocents-review-icily-brilliant-tale-of-kids-with-supernatural-powers-is-future-classic
5/18/2022,"Good morning. Joe Biden has condemned those who spread white supremacist lies “for power, political gain and for profit” during a visit to Buffalo, New York, where 10 people were killed in a racist shooting last Saturday. The US president was close to tears as he recalled the victims’ lives, then became angry as he described forces of hatred that have haunted his administration. “In America, evil will not win, I promise you,” Biden said. “Hate will not prevail and white supremacy will not have the last word.” The mass shooting shook a nation that can sometimes seem numbed to atrocities and marked an alarming convergence of racist extremism, gun violence and the radicalizing effects of social media. What have police discovered about Payton Gendron? Police have said they are investigating a 180-page manifesto the shooting suspect was believed to have written outlining the “great replacement” theory, which baselessly claims white people are being intentionally overrun by other races. How did 4chan’s toxic culture help radicalize Buffalo shooting suspect? Payton Gendron first fell into logging on to the far-right message board 4chan daily during the pandemic. In Discord chat logs believed to be written by Gendron, he writes: “I only really turned racist when 4chan started giving me facts.” Tymofiy Seidov is the only child left in his village near the city of Kharkiv, in north-east Ukraine, writes Daniel Boffey. The eight-year-old spends much of his time drawing at a little table, dimly illuminated from above by a tiny LED light, in the corner of the otherwise almost completely dark 40x5-metre basement that he shares with 23 others including his mother, aunt and grandmother. The fighting around Kutuzivka has been bitter. Closer to Russia than any other large Ukrainian city, Kharkiv was a key target for Vladimir Putin. The Russians took the village on 18 March before losing it to Ukrainian forces about two weeks ago. Fewer than 50 residents have stayed in Kutuzivka since Russian forces invaded. But even when Ukrainian soldiers took it back, some in the village had nowhere to go but underground. Meanwhile, Russia’s defence ministry has issued its latest operation briefing. It says that a total of 959 combatants have surrendered from the Azovstal steel plant since Monday. It said 694 Ukrainian fighters who had been under siege surrendered over the last 24 hours. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 84 of the invasion. Pennsylvania Republicans yesterday nominated Donald Trump’s choice for governor, an election denier who was outside the Capitol on 6 January, but were divided over his candidate for Senate in a consequential round of primary contests in which Madison Cawthorn, the scandal-plagued first-term congressman, was ousted in North Carolina. Voters in five states went to the polls on Tuesday to pick the candidates at the center of some of this year’s most contentious battles for control of Congress, statehouses and governor’s offices. From Oregon to North Carolina, Idaho to Kentucky and Pennsylvania, the array of nominating contests tested both Trump’s grip on the Republican party and Joe Biden’s leadership of the Democratic party. In Pennsylvania – a perennial swing state and one of the fiercest electoral battlegrounds – Doug Mastriano, a far-right state senator who was a key figure in the effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election in the state, will face the Democrat Josh Shapiro, the Pennsylvania attorney general, in a highly anticipated contest for governor. When did Trump endorse Mastriano? Despite his Maga bona fides, Trump endorsed Mastriano only in the final days of the campaign after he had consistently led in the polls. But his candidacy has worried party leaders concerned that he is too extreme to appeal to swing voters in the state. North Korea stands on the brink of a Covid-19 catastrophe unless swift action is taken to provide vaccines and drug treatments, experts say, as the number of people reported to have fallen ill rose to almost 1.5 million. The isolated country yesterday reported another big rise in new cases of what it refers to as “fever”. The US Department of Justice has sued Steve Wynn, the billionaire former casino mogul and senior Republican fundraiser, to compel him to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act as an agent of China. The department says Wynn lobbied the Trump administration for the People’s Republic of China. A Japanese man who was mistakenly sent ¥46.3m (£287,000/US$358,000) in Covid-19 relief funds has admitted he gambled away the entire amount in the space of a fortnight. The mayor of Abu, Norihiko Hamada, described the man’s actions as “unforgivable” and said the town would do its utmost to recover the money. Anti-abortion Facebook pages with millions of followers are spreading disinformation about abortion to Spanish speakers with little to no intervention from the social media platform, according to a report from Naral Pro-Choice America. The probable demise of Roe v Wade will be a “catastrophe” for women in low- and middle-income countries, with an emboldened anti-choice movement likely to raise renewed pressure on hard-won gains, doctors and activists have warned. The leak this month of the draft ruling stunned many in America. But those shockwaves did not stop at the borders of the US, as pro-choice figures around the world warned it “send a really clear message” of inspiration to anti-choice groups. Pollution is killing 9 million people a year, a review has found, making it responsible for one in six of all deaths. Toxic air and contaminated water and soil “is an existential threat to human health and planetary health, and jeopardises the sustainability of modern societies”, the review concluded. The death toll from pollution dwarfs that from road traffic deaths, HIV/Aids, malaria and TB combined, or from drug and alcohol misuse. The US Congress held its first open briefing on UFOs in more than 50 years yesterday, but those seeking explanations for the numerous military sightings of unexplained objects were left disappointed, as defense officials appeared to hold their juiciest information for closed door hearings. The hearing, the first of its nature since 1966, came after a bumper year for UFO enthusiasts. In 2021, US intelligence released a landmark report that found 144 reports of unidentified aerial phenomenon, only one of which could be explained.

5/18/2022,"The British government’s plan to walk away from parts of the Northern Ireland Brexit deal is destroying the repaired relationship with the EU, political leaders and diplomats have said. Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, told a business dinner in Dublin on Tuesday night that the move was “breeding mistrust in EU capitals”. A measure of the anger and disbelief within the EU was reflected in a tweet posted by the German diplomat Sebastian Fischer, considered one of the most mild-mannered of his cadre in Brussels. “Let’s just all threaten each other with breaking international law. Makes for really good partnerships #Brexit,” he tweeted on Tuesday evening. Let’s just all threaten each other with breaking international law. Makes for really good partnerships. #Brexit “If you are wondering what friends and allies think …” tweeted Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, in response. If you’re wondering what friends and allies think….. #Brexit https://t.co/RWnmM1AqZL There is a growing feeling of disbelief and disappointment in the EU over the UK’s position, given the goodwill Boris Johnson had built up over Ukraine. “The fact that the UK government is talking openly about breaching international law is a matter of concern,” Varadkar said. “[It] stands in contrast with the enormous leadership the UK government is showing in supporting Ukraine against Russia, which has breached international law in a very serious way,” the tánaiste said. He co-designed the protocol with Johnson in October 2019 to deliver a breakthrough that helped the Conservative party leader present what he described as an “oven-ready” real to the electorate in an election the following December. There are fears that the relationship between London and Brussels, which had deteriorated badly over the past four or five years due to Brexit, has once again been damaged. Diplomats have expressed incredulity at the British move, which threatens to splinter western unity against Vladimir Putin. But one EU source said they had expected the move and believe Johnson will ultimately pull back from any attempt to break a treaty signed two years ago. “There will be American pressure on Boris Johnson. The US will not want to see a rift in Europe at this time. It simply will not allow a trade war,” they said. EU leaders have argued that there is scope to change the protocol but they had been waiting for the UK’s response to proposals in October and subsequent suggestions laid out in February. Speaking in Dublin on Tuesday, Coveney said there had been “no serious engagement since February” between the EU and the UK, contrary to claims by the foreign secretary, Liz Truss in the Commons that she had been engaged in talks for the past six months. “Instead of engaging, the British government has decided that it is going to threaten domestic legislation to set aside elements of the protocol which is part of an international treaty … I think that is going to cause a lot more problems than it solves if they go ahead and do that,” Coveney said.",News/UK news,UK threat over NI Brexit deal ‘breeding mistrust in EU capitals’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/18/uk-threat-over-northern-ireland-brexit-deal-breeding-mistrust-in-eu-capitals
