1/29/2022,"Edison Flores scored a late goal for Peru to earn a 1-0 away win over Colombia on Friday, boosting their chances of qualifying for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Half-time substitute Flores struck after 85 minutes to give Peru a priceless victory in Barranquilla. The DC United winger raced on to a through ball and fired a low, angled shot which Colombia keeper David Ospina allowed in at his near post.

Remarkably, Reinaldo Rueda‚Äôs side have now failed to score in their last six World Cup qualifiers. Peru had two shots at goal to Colombia‚Äôs 20 and their goalkeeper, Pedro Gallese, made some fine saves to keep his team level before Flores struck. Peru‚Äôs third consecutive qualifying win moved them into fourth place in the 10-team table, one point above Uruguay, who beat 10-man Paraguay on Thursday thanks to a Luis Su√°rez winner. Colombia slip to sixth place; the top four qualify automatically for Qatar with the side in fifth facing a playoff with a team from the Asian qualifiers. Brazil and Argentina have already booked their places and third-placed Ecuador are well-placed to join them. Peru‚Äôs next game is at home to Ecuador on Tuesday, while Colombia are away to Argentina the same night. Bolivia missed the chance to climb above Colombia as they lost 4-1 to the group‚Äôs bottom team, Venezuela. Earlier, Argentina put a major dent in the qualifying hopes of local rivals Chile with a 2-1 away victory in Calama. The visitors rested Lionel Messi but still took the lead through √Ångel Di Mar√≠a‚Äôs fine curling finish just 10 minutes in. Blackburn‚Äôs Ben Brereton D√≠az continued his rich vein of form with the hosts‚Äô equaliser as he sent a fine looping header over Emiliano Mart√≠nez 10 minutes later. Argentina got the victory in controversial fashion, taking advantage of an injury to Claudio Bravo 11 minutes before half-time. With the Chile keeper preparing to be substituted, Rodrigo De Paul shot from long range and with Bravo only able to parry the shot, Lautaro Mart√≠nez followed up to slot home the rebound. ‚ÄúEverything is always much easier when Leo is here,‚Äù Di Mar√≠a said of his teammate, who is still recovering from Covid-19. The Argentina coach, Lionel Scaloni, also missed the game after testing positive. ‚ÄúToday we were without the best in the world and our coach, but we got the victory and this is also for them,‚Äù Di Mar√≠a added. Mehdi Taremi‚Äôs close-range winner sealed Iran‚Äôs third straight World Cup qualification as they beat neighbours Iraq 1-0 in Tehran. The Porto striker scored from Alireza Jahanbakhsh‚Äôs pass early in the second half as the AFC Group A leaders booked their place in Qatar. Despite the fast spread of the omicron variant of the coronavirus in Iran, the government allowed 10,000 spectators to attend the match. More than 2,000 were women ‚Äì in line with Fifa‚Äôs demands that Iran allow female spectators to attend World Cup qualifiers. It marked just the second occasion that women have been able to watch a major football match in Iran.",Sport/Football,Peru boost World Cup qualifying hopes as late winner puts Colombia in trouble,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/29/world-cup-qualifying-south-america-colombia-peru

The British prime minister is determined to ‚Äúaccelerate diplomatic efforts‚Äù and ‚Äúramp up deterrence to avoid bloodshed‚Äù in the coming days, according to government sources.  The planned trip to the region comes amid rising tensions between Ukraine and Russia, which is continuing to build up its forces on its neighbour‚Äôs border. However, it will not go unnoticed that the prime minister‚Äôs overseas visit comes at a time of rising tensions on the domestic front, with a redacted version of the long-awaited Sue Gray report expected to be published imminently. Johnson has faced widespread criticism that his government has been ‚Äúparalysed‚Äù by ‚Äúpartygate‚Äù at a time when he ought to be focusing on other issues, such as the escalating Ukraine crisis, as well as the cost of living. A Downing Street spokesperson said: ‚ÄúThe prime minister is determined to accelerate diplomatic efforts and ramp up deterrence to avoid bloodshed in Europe. ‚ÄúHe will reiterate the need for Russia to step back and engage diplomatically when he speaks to president Putin this week.‚Äù It comes after Johnson asked defence and security chiefs to consider further defensive military options in Europe during a high-level intelligence briefing on the situation last week. He will consider a range of options to deter Russian aggression in the region, including fresh deployments and bolstering Nato‚Äôs defences after a Ministry of Defence meeting this weekend. Meanwhile, the Foreign Office is expected to announce tougher sanctions on Monday, meaning the UK can target Russia‚Äôs strategic and financial interests ‚Äì despite reported US worries over the extent of ‚Äúdirty‚Äù Russian money in London. American diplomats have raised concerns that any sanctions imposed on Russia over the potential conflict would prove to be ineffective due to the sheer amount of Russian wealth in the capital, also referred to as ‚ÄúLondongrad‚Äù.",News/World news,Boris Johnson to visit Ukraine region and hold call with Putin next week,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/29/boris-johnson-to-visit-ukraine-region-and-hold-call-with-putin-next-week
