1/13/2022,"A judge in Kentucky offered a man convicted of sexual assault the option to rejoin the military in lieu of jail time this month. Brandon Scott Price, 28, was convicted of sexually assaulting a female inmate at Franklin County Regional Jail where he worked as a guard. While judges are free to make these determinations, military regulations prevent applicants from being court-ordered into service without a waiver. A Kentucky judge ordered an Army veteran convicted of sexual assault to rejoin the military or go to jail, The State Journal reported Friday. Brandon Scott Price, a 28-year-old former prison guard, was convicted of sexually assaulting a female inmate at the Franklin County Regional Jail. Price was initially charged with third-degree sodomy, which is a Class D felony, but he pleaded down to a lesser charge of second-degree assault, a Class A misdemeanor, his attorney told Insider. Judge Thomas Wingate sentenced Price on Friday to 12 months in jail, suspended for two years, but said Price could avoid jail time if Price enlisted in the military within 30 days, according to The State Journal of Frankfort, Ky. ""If you don't enroll in 30 days, you can report to the Franklin County Regional Jail,"" Wingate said. ""You are under the gun, young man. You gotta do it."" Despite the judge's request, however, enlistments are subject to military regulations that would require Price to seek a waiver for his sexual assault conviction from military officials. The military has spent more than a decade struggling to limit sexual assault among troops and punish perpetrators. A female inmate claimed that she was sexually assaulted and filed a lawsuit against Franklin County and several former jail staff, including Price, in July 2019. According to the lawsuit, in January 2019, the inmate experienced a medical emergency and needed to be transported to the hospital. ""Though Price's shift was near its end, Price volunteered to transport (the inmate) to the hospital,"" the lawsuit explained. ""Price transported (the inmate) alone, in violation of Jail policy and industry standards and practices."" Price stayed with the inmate for five hours at the Frankfort Regional Medical Center while making ""sexually-charged comments"" to her and talking about his connections to someone responsible for parole decisions at the Kentucky Department of Corrections, the lawsuit alleged. On the way back to the prison from the medical facility, Price pulled the van he was driving over and assaulted the woman, according to the suit. The lawsuit alleges Price propositioned the inmate with an offer to help her get early release in exchange for a sex act, and then assaulted the woman while she was shackled. When Price was interviewed about the incident he said he ""made a stupid mistake"" and ""let a female inmate touch me inappropriately."" He was later arrested after an investigation by jail officials. ""You're getting a huge break,"" Wingate said during Price's sentencing. ""You made a terrible mistake, which I know personally cost the county money."" While judges are free to make these determinations, they carry very little legal weight. Army Regulation 610-210 — which covers Army recruitment guidelines — says that an applicant is ineligible if ""as a condition for any civil conviction or adverse disposition or any other reason through a civil or criminal court, [they are] ordered or subjected to a sentence that implies or imposes enlistment into the Armed Forces of the United States."" Applicants can apply for a waiver, but must demonstrate ""sufficient mitigating circumstances that clearly justify approving the waiver."" The history of these waivers is murky, at best. During the War on Terror the military granted thousands of moral waivers for drug offenses, violent felonies and sex offenders. One such beneficiary, Steven Green, had three misdemeanor convictions before enlisting in the Army where he ended up at the center of a notorious war crime committed in Iraq in 2006. Price's attorney told Insider that he previously served in the Army, which is why the judge decided on the terms of his probation. ""It is not uncommon for judges to put unique conditions like this based on the defendant that is in front of them and create conditions that will best serve them to stay on the straight and narrow,"" Whitney Lawson, an attorney for Price, told Insider. ""It's just that this one happened to have the military element to it."" Lawson said Price has already started the process of renlisting, but it has been difficult. ""The problem is, you can ask ten people whether he can reenlist and in what branch and they'll give you nine different answers so we're trying to work through that,"" Lawson told Insider. It's unlikely Price would be granted a waiver for his get-out-of-jail-free card, but this isn't the first or last time a judge or lawmaker will equate jail with military service. In December, Florida Senator Darryl Rouson (D-St. Petersburg) filed a bill in the state legislature that would allow those convicted of nonviolent misdemeanors to enlist rather than go to jail.

1/13/2022,"After a whirlwind romance and a pregnancy, Harold Dean Clouse and Tina Linn Clouse were married in June 1979. By 1981 the couple went missing, and their families had little closure until their bodies were exhumed and identified 40 years later. Harold was 22 and Tina was 18 when they went missing. The truth behind their disappearance wasn't uncovered until a genetic genealogy agency tested their DNA and linked it to the bodies of a couple who was murdered in 1981. Although Tina and Harold have been found, their child, Hollie Marie, who would be 41 today, is still missing. ""I will never forget my son and his Tina, I went years in pain wondering where they were. Now I can only keep praying God lets me see my granddaughter one day,"" Donna Casasanta, Harold's mother, told USA TODAY. Casasanta reported her son missing in 1981 after months of no communication. She said her son had joined a religious cult in past years and the police quickly ""excused the disappearance with them leaving with the cult."" ""I spent years waiting to get a call from my son or calling police stations each time a new male body was found. I spent years with my chest on fire, just waiting,"" Casasanta told USA TODAY. In January 1981, a dog wandered into the woods and returned with a human arm in its mouth. Local police later discovered a man who was beaten to death and a woman who had been strangled, the Houston Chronicle reported in 2011. Decades-old cold case reopened: Diver finds 1998 Pontiac belonging to missing Tennessee teen Case of Harmony Montgomery: Father arrested in case of child last seen in 2019 ,reported missing the last week of 2021 Years went by without the bodies being identified and without progress in Harold's and Tina's missing persons case. That was until the bodies were exhumed in 2011 and Identifinders International, a California-based organization that performs genetic genealogy for law enforcement, decided to take on the case. Allison Peacock, who worked with the genealogy and operations team with Identifinders International, called the Clouse family and confirmed the couple was Harold and Tina. However, their child, Hollie was never found. Brooks said the family will never know full closure until those responsible for the murders are arrested and Hollie is found. ""I can't stop thinking about what if she's out there, what if she doesn't know we're looking for her. I can't stop thinking of seeing her again,"" Debbie Brooks, Harold's sister, told USA TODAY. Brooks said as far as the family knows Hollie was last seen in Lewisville, Texas, and there is an ongoing investigation into her disappearance in that area. Peacock, who now functions as the Clouse family's advocate and public relations contact, said she's working with agencies to create a progression photo that will show what Hollie would look like today. The hope is the photo and multiple news articles will reach Hollie or someone who knows her. Debbie and other family members have submitted swabs of their DNA to ancestry.com and other ancestry sites in hopes of matching with Hollie or a relative who knows of her whereabouts. The Clouse family said just as they never stopped searching for Harold and Tina, they'll never stop looking for Hollie. ""Finding Hollie is the last puzzle piece, the last piece of my brother and Tina. It means everything to us to find her,"" Brooks said. The Clouse and Linn family urge anyone with information to contact Lewisville police. Gillis told USA TODAY she often works on cold cases of perpetrators or children and was interested in reuniting the ""love birds who died together"" with their families. Harold's and Tina's DNA and information were uploaded to Gedmatch.com, a genealogy site that shares their users' genetic information with law enforcement agencies nationwide. Gillis connected Harold's DNA with cousins in Kentucky, and in just 10 days she identified the man who was unidentified for 40 years. After speaking to the Clouse family about Harold and his background, Peacock was able to identify the woman's body as Tina's. ""When I got the call, I felt shock. Just shock. It had been so long of just driving down the road and hoping to see Junior [Harold]. I'd see a man in the store and think, 'Well doesn't that look like him,'"" Debbie Brooks, Harold's sister told USA TODAY. ""That call that his body was found changed everything; it helped me stop looking."" In early 1981, Casasanta said Harold had been working in carpentry and focusing on fatherhood before his disappearance. She recalled Tina being the most ""innocent and sweet"" person anyone would ever meet. Although the couple was known to frequent cults in the '80s, Casasanta said she was never satisfied with the conclusion that they had run away with the cult. The Clouse family never stopped looking for the family. They contacted the Salvation Army and the Social Security Administration about their whereabouts. The family also ensured Harold's, Tina's and Hollie's names always stayed on the missing person's list. ""I prayed to God to send me answers about my boy before I died. I just wanted to know where he was, and then last year we got the call,"" Casasanta said. ""God answered my prayer, and now my chest isn't so heavy."" But for Brooks, the identification of the bodies isn't enough. ""I want to know who did this, who killed them and why. I want to find Hollie, I need to know if my niece had a good life, if she was abused, if she's okay.""

1/13/2022,"We know, we know. Just as vaccines became widely available and we thought we were seeing light at the end of the Covid-19 pandemic tunnel, the Omicron variant reared its ugly head. It seems like everybody and their mother is testing positive, despite being vaccinated, almost like it’s a matter of when, not if, you’ll be the next one to get infected. Even though the Omicron variant is running rampant and proving to be even more contagious than previous variants and strains, the good news is that infections are mostly looking to be far less severe in people who are vaccinated, also making for less hospitalizations. Still, we don’t blame you if you want to be smart and still do your best to avoid becoming infected at all. As such, we consulted with a physician about what Omicron Covid-19 symptoms to watch for to stay healthy. As mentioned, the Omicron variant is causing much milder symptoms than the original Covid strain and the Delta variant, which is good news, says Suneet Singh, MD, an emergency room physician and medical director of CareHive Health in Austin, Texas.  The classic symptoms of the earlier strains were: cough, fever, and intense muscle aches, as well as the loss of taste or smell. In very severe cases, chest pressure, as well as shortness of breath, were also prominent symptoms. Given we know the classic Covid-19 symptoms, let's break down just how different the Omicron variant is as far as symptoms, and how to know if you have it. Aside from classic Covid-19 symptoms, according to Dr. Singh, some of the distinguishing symptoms of the Omicron variant are: runny nose stuffy nose sore throat  “Omicron, [meanwhile,] is less likely to invade the lungs,” Dr. Singh says. “Instead, Omicron is causing more upper respiratory symptoms.” Omicron is not known to result in a loss of taste or smell, unlike the other variants, Dr. Singh continues. However, because the symptoms of Omicron are less severe, it can be hard to differentiate it from other causes of upper respiratory conditions like seasonal allergies. (Because it wasn’t already challenging enough to determine if it’s a cold or Covid, right?) If you do have symptoms such as a runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, cough, and/or fever, it is very important to get tested as soon as possible and stay at home while you wait for your results, Dr. Singh says. If you test positive for Covid-19, no matter the variant, it’s important to consult with your doctor about the best treatment path forward for you as an individual, Dr. Singh says. You can safely do this with a virtual visit to limit your exposure to others while you’re sick. Not only is this more convenient than unnecessarily heading to the ER or urgent care, it’s also likely going to be far cheaper. “During this visit, you may be prescribed one of the two new anti-Covid medications that recently became available on the market earlier this year,” he explains. “Your team will also work with you to determine if you are a candidate for monoclonal antibody therapy.” In any case, if you have Covid, be sure to get plenty of rest, hydrate well, and use over-the-counter medications such as throat lozenges, pain relievers like ibuprofen, and fever-lowering medications like acetaminophen, or Tylenol, he adds. Without a doubt, the best means of protection against Covid altogether is to get vaccinated (that is, a full series and their recommended booster) if you haven’t already, he says. “In addition to vaccination, social distancing remains an important part of protection from Omicron,” he adds. “If possible, try to maintain a safe distance of at least six feet apart from others, minimizing physical contact and wearing an appropriately fitting mask to reduce the risk of [getting] Covid.” Additionally, if you are going to still gather with others, especially with anyone at high risk of Covid-related complications, it’s also important to get tested within 48 hours of the event. This is key for detecting an infection while you may be symptomatic, Dr. Singh says.  “A PCR test is considered the gold-standard test to detect all variants of COVID, including Omicron,” he says. “Antigen [or rapid] tests are also useful to detect disease, but they are known to be less sensitive. Ideally, a negative antigen test result should be followed by a PCR test for a definitive answer. If either a PCR or antigen test is positive, then you are actively infected with the disease.” The bottom line: While you can rest easily knowing that becoming infected with Omicron is likely to be less severe if you’re vaccinated, continue to do your best to avoid becoming infected altogether. And it can’t be said enough: If you still haven’t gotten vaccinated, schedule your appointment to do so today.

1/13/2022,"By David Brunnstrom and Chris Gallagher WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on six North Koreans, one Russian and a Russian firm it said were responsible for procuring goods from Russia and China for North Korea's weapons programs, an action that follows a series of North Korean missile launches, including two since last week. The U.S. Treasury said the steps aimed to prevent the advancement of North Korea's weapons programs and impede its attempts to proliferate weapons technologies. The sanctions were the first specifically targeting North Korea's weapons programs imposed by the Biden administration, which has sought unsuccessfully to engage Pyongyang in dialogue to persuade it to give up its nuclear bombs and missiles. U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Washington remained committed to pursuing diplomacy with North Korea. ""What we have seen in recent days ... only underscores our belief that if we are going to make progress, that we will need to engage in that dialogue,"" he told a regular news briefing. The Treasury Department said the sanctions followed six North Korean ballistic missile launches since September, each of which violated U.N. Security Council resolutions. Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson said the moves targeted North Korea's ""continued use of overseas representatives to illegally procure goods for weapons."" North Korea's latest launches were ""further evidence that it continues to advance prohibited programs despite the international community's calls for diplomacy and denuclearization,"" Nelson said in a statement. It said the State Department had designated Russia-based North Korean Choe Myong Hyon, Russian national Roman Anatolyevich Alara and the Russian firm Parsek LLC for ""activities or transactions that have materially contributed to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or their means of delivery."" It said Choe Myong Hyon, a Vladivostok-based representative of North Korea’s Second Academy of Natural Sciences (SANS), had worked to procure telecommunications-related equipment from Russia. Four China-based North Korean representatives of SANS-subordinate organizations - Sim Kwang Sok, Kim Song Hun, Kang Chol Hak and Pyon Kwang Chol - and one other North Korean, O Yong Ho, were also targeted. Sim Kwang Sok, based in Dalian, had worked to procure steel alloys and Kim Song Hun, who was based in Shenyang, software and chemicals, Treasury said. North Korea's U.N. mission, Russia and China's embassies in Washington and the Russian firm did not respond to requests for comment. North Korean media said leader Kim Jong Un observed the test of a hypersonic missile on Tuesday, the second in less than a week after he vowed in a New Year speech to bolster the military with cutting-edge technology. Tuesday's test came hours after the U.S. mission to the United Nations, joined by Albania, France, Ireland, Japan and the United Kingdom, condemned last week's launch and called on U.N. states to fulfill sanctions obligations. U.N. resolutions ban North Korean ballistic missile and nuclear tests and impose sanctions. Anthony Ruggiero, a sanctions expert in the former Trump administration that failed to persuade Kim to roll back his nuclear program despite unprecedented engagement, called the new sanctions ""a good start."" However, he said the Biden administration had allowed a reversal of sanctions pressure and added: ""Biden needs to continue the designations to increase the pressure on the Kim regime."" Price did not respond when asked why no Chinese individuals or entities were targeted, or specifically when asked if China and Russia were doing enough to enforce sanctions, but stressed the importance of all U.N. states doing so, while adding: ""Obviously we've not see all of that."" Wednesday's actions freeze any U.S.-related assets of those targeted and prohibit all dealings with them.

1/13/2022,"Democratic leaders have found a mechanism to enable them to bypass an initial Republican filibuster and debate the party's sweeping elections reform bills, according to a new leadership memo obtained by Axios. Why it matters: The strategy is the latest example of how Democrats are seeking new ways to try to bypass Senate procedures that are blocking their agenda. But the ultimate outcome will likely be the same: insufficient support to change the 60-vote threshold needed to pass sweeping voting rights reforms. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free Driving the news: The House is expected to take up an amendment in the coming days related to NASA leasing “underutilized” property to private groups. Democratic leaders are referring to this as the ""shell bill."" It will then strip that legislation of its existing language and replace it with the text for the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The House would then pass the updated bill and send it to the Senate as a ""message."" Then, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) will file a motion to concur with the House amendment. Between the lines: This would allow the Senate — for the first time — to quickly take up the bill and debate it on the floor. Up until now, every time Schumer has tried to bring up both elections bills, Republicans have blocked it from even being debated by opposing a cloture vote on the motion to proceed. Worth noting: This wonky process is similar to the strategy Congress used last month to quickly take up and eventually pass a debt limit increase and avoid a default. Be smart: Regardless of this new tactic, the Senate would still need to lower the 60-vote filibuster in order to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Acts in the face of Republicans' total opposition to the bills. But Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) are against going nuclear on the filibuster in order to do so, which means the bills will likely fail. The fight over changing or bypassing the filibuster will now take place when Schumer moves to end debate on the legislation. Meetings among key Senate Democrats, Manchin and Sinema are continuing to take place this week on a potential path to changing Senate rules. What they're saying: ""Taking advantage of this existing exception to the Senate’s supermajority requirements will allow us to end the Republicans’ ability to block debate on voting rights legislation,"" Schumer said in the memo to Senate Democrats. ""The Senate will finally debate voting rights legislation, and then every Senator will be faced with a choice of whether or not to pass the legislation to protect our democracy."" ""Of course, to ultimately end debate and pass the voting rights legislation, we will need 10 Republicans to join us – which we know from past experience will not happen – or we will need to change the Senate rules as has been done many times before."" What's next: The House is expected to vote on the ""shell bill"" as early as tomorrow, and then the Senate will immediately take up the bill. His goal of voting on a package of Senate rules changes that would allow Democrats to bypass the filibuster and pass voting reforms by or on Jan. 17, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, remains in effect, his team says.

1/13/2022,"Christopher Hall parks his old Toyota on a dirt road that dead-ends in a forest in Oregon’s Illinois Valley. He points out a cluster of greenhouses surrounded by piles of trash, and the hillside above, which has been terraced and entirely stripped of vegetation. Guard dogs run through a small clearing, barking at us. Two men pull up almost instantly in a Honda with busted headlights; the driver asks Hall what he’s doing there. For a bespectacled middle-aged conservationist, Hall is surprisingly reckless. Even though he can see the men are armed, he yells back at them: “Where are you from? We know what you’re doing here is illegal! How many plants are you growing?” One man says they’re from Serbia and claims they have a license to grow as another truck pulls up. I tell Hall I think we should move on, and he reluctantly shifts into drive but is unable to resist a few parting shots: “Do you think you can just keep trashing our streams? Have some respect for the land!” This part of south-western Oregon – which encompasses Josephine, Jackson and Douglas counties and was settled by goldminers in the 1850s – has always kept a touch of the wild west anti-authority streak, contributing to its status as a stronghold of illegal cannabis farms since the 1960s. Pot was legalized for recreational use in Oregon in 2015, making it legal for any person to grow up to four plants. But in the past year, longtime locals have been alarmed by the rapid proliferation of unlicensed pot farms, unprecedented in terms of size and allegedly controlled by crime syndicates from eastern Europe, China and Mexico. Hall, community liaison for the Illinois Valley Soil and Water Conservation District, has been flying over the region in a single-engine plane to map illegal pot farms and has pinpointed 1,030 clusters of greenhouses on just 20 miles of the valley, 80% of which he estimates are illegal. Local authorities agree with that estimate. These large grows have flooded the market – a pound of cannabis that was worth $3,000 in 2009 here might now fetch $400, all but killing the industry for small-time legal growers. County officials say they have been inundated by hundreds of complaints from locals who accuse “crime syndicates” of stealing their farm equipment and their water. Hall documents the impact of the illegal farms depleting aquifers by pumping from protected rivers and digging huge pits to tap into the groundwater. “It takes an act of God to get a water right in Oregon, so they just don’t bother. They just dig holes,” he says. “One of the biggest complaints this year is that people’s wells are underperforming or just drying right out,” he says. “The threat to the environmental health of the region cannot be overstated. The community is upside down.” Jackson and Douglas counties declared a state of emergency in October and asked Governor Kate Brown for state funding for more enforcement personnel because local authorities are overwhelmed. This request is not unprecedented. The national guard have participated in pot raids since 1989, when Operation Green Sweep descended on the nearby Emerald Triangle, California’s most prolific weed region, the tip of which touches southern Oregon. Those raiders saw 1,300 cannabis plants destroyed, and locals protested against that deployment of federal troops to small farms. In 2019, government raids destroyed 953,459 plants in California. It’s the same story in Oregon, where busts on large grows now yield tens of thousands of plants.“When I say cartels, I’m not talking just Hispanic,” says the Josephine county sheriff, Dave Daniel, who welcomes the idea of state and federal help. “I’m talking Bulgarian, Ukrainian, Chinese, east coast drug trafficking organizations.” Daniel, who has been sheriff since 2015, is a big man with close-cropped silver hair. “The 2021 grow season was the most brazen, in your face, wide open that I’ve seen yet,” he says. He describes farms where crews of migrant workers live under armed guard, without refrigeration or sanitation. “They rule by fear of injury and death. They human-traffic. We know that,” he says of the cartels.With a team of just three detectives, Daniel doesn’t have the manpower to properly tackle the problem. “Have you ever seen the movie Animal House?” he asks. “Kevin Bacon is in his little police or military uniform and he’s got his hands in the air and he says ‘Remain calm, all is well’ and then completely gets mowed over by the crowd? That’s me. That’s Josephine county law enforcement right there.” A big part of the problem is rooted in the legalization of industrial hemp, which looks and smells like marijuana but won’t get you high. Since 2010, it’s been legal to grow hemp in unlimited quantities. After the hemp market crashed in 2018, some farmers began hiding psychoactive cannabis plants in their hemp fields and many more leased their properties to out-of-state operators who claimed they planned on growing hemp. This ruse allows criminal organizations to grow on a vast scale. Douglas county law enforcement recently raided two supposed hemp farms they believe are operated by the same cartel and seized a total of 122,000 cannabis plants – nearly 50 times the quantity of plants that can typically be grown under a recreational cannabis license. In another Douglas county raid this November, police seized 500,000 pounds of weed, which they estimate is worth $500m. Although Governor Brown declined to send in the national guard this harvest season, which ended mid-November, Daniel hopes he will have the state’s support next year. “We’re in close contact with the governor and our federal partners are starting to open their eyes. I’ve talked to the FBI, and the DEA. And everyone is going, ‘Something’s not right in southern Oregon.’” Communities here used to be close-knit. Unlicensed pot farms abounded, but the growers were largely local people and thus had some sense of accountability to one another and the environment. Nicole Rensenbrink, a social worker who is married to the local veterinarian, has lived in Josephine county since 1983 and laments how much it has changed in recent years, describing “the endless ugliness that the huge influx of cannabis farms has brought to our valley”. She says their once-picturesque drive to work is “riddled with ugly plastic hoop houses, fencing and industrial-looking buildings,” – all the makings for large-scale pot grows. She has to keep her dogs away from the creek that runs through her property because it’s full of “nasty looking slime”; she blames fertilizer run-off from the unregulated farms. Tim Freeman, a Douglas county commissioner, says for some locals the issue goes beyond dismay over a changing landscape. “When residents call in, they are scared,” Freeman says. “They are scared about where they live, afraid of what’s going on around them and, in many cases, they are afraid to leave their homes.” Terra and Jerry Palmer live in a shingled one-room cabin that Jerry built 30 years ago. The couple were saving up to build a bigger house on their land, but are considering moving because of an illegal grow that moved in nearby last year. Terra describes constant traffic on their country road, a steady stream of “pickup trucks full of young men”, cars without license plates, and trucks full of cannabis. Hundreds of trees Jerry planted over the years have started to die off due to a lack of water.“I’m really discouraged because this year the creek went dry two months earlier than it’s ever gone dry during the all years that I’ve been here,” Jerry says. The couple have not confronted their neighbors. They fear reprisals and asked that their names be changed. Terra and Jerry may look like typical older hippies, but they come off as conventional when discussing the consequences for breaking the law on such a large scale. “Confiscate the property and jail landowners who knowingly lease land to illegal growers. Deport illegal migrant workers,” Terra wrote in a letter beseeching authorities to take action. A migrant, mostly undocumented, workforce is required to farm on the scale southern Oregon is dealing with now. Sheriff Daniel is less aggressive on the subject of those workers. “We don’t look into immigration status. State law doesn’t allow us to,” he says. “Which is fine. I treat these workers like they’re victims, to be honest with you. Which I think in large part they are.” Kathy Keesee-Morales is the program coordinator for the Unete Center for Farm Worker Advocacy, an organization that lobbies for worker rights and provides support to the migrant community. Bosses withholding pay and substandard living conditions are the most prominent issues her organization has to address in relation to cannabis farms.“There were some pretty extreme cases. There’s farms where there were young children living in what someone referred to as squalor. They were sleeping under black plastic tarps inside the hoop houses,” she says. About half of the 200 complaints of wage withholding they received in 2021 are from workers who have been abused, like the man who said when he tried to leave the farm his boss put a gun to his head and threatened his family. Large pot farms with armed bosses aren’t where most of the migrant workers planned to end up. But last year, wildfires swept through the region, immolating the nearby towns of Phoenix and Talent. This year was so dry the governor had declared a state of drought emergency by June. “So these farm workers that were depending on harvesting the orchards and the grapes to be able to survive – literally survive over the summer and save up money for the winter – they didn’t have anywhere to go except to work for these [cannabis] farms,” Morales says. The threat of violence isn’t limited to workers. “I’ve had a homeowner who leased out his property, but then he realized it wasn’t actually just a hemp grow,” says Sheriff Daniel. “He started questioning one of the soldiers – managers, soldiers, whatever you want to call it – and they threatened to burn his house down. They said, ‘We can take care of this real quick. One match. So mind your own business.’” The abuse of workers, environmental degradation and threats of violence towards locals have pushed some residents who have historically been skeptical of federal drug enforcement to ask for exactly that. Cedar Grey and his wife, Madrone, own Siskiyou Sungrown, a seven-year-old permitted cannabis farm with 5,000 plants, which is large for a legal operation. But he has been growing cannabis in this area since 1998, the year Oregon legalized marijuana for medical use. “Our local government seems to spend more time enforcing compliance on legal cannabis farms than even visiting illegal cannabis farms,” Cedar says. “That’s incredibly frustrating to legal cannabis farms. The amount of money we spend and the hoops that we jump through to be compliant with regulations – it’s mountainous, it’s unbelievable,” Cedar says. To ensure licensed cannabis farms aren’t selling on the illicit market, Oregon law requires that farmers document every scrap of plant material they grow – from seed to sale. Growers are responsible for tagging and tracking every single plant. And all work must be done on camera – even the farm’s compost piles are under surveillance. If they snip a leaf from a branch, they have to weigh the clipping and report it to the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission, the organization that strictly monitors all legal pot farms. Grey estimates he has spent $150,000 for cameras, video, alarms and tracking systems in the last seven years. “I mean it’s really, really strange for me to be calling for a huge law enforcement or military crackdown on growing marijuana because for so long I just wanted it to be free for people to grow,” Cedar says. “But what’s happening here has to stop. It’s too bad, it’s too wrong, and it’s too damaging. I fully support federal resources being brought, Oregon national guard and federal law enforcement coming in. Hit every one of these farms.”",U.S./The Guardian,‘Something’s not right in southern Oregon’: alarm at rise of illegal pot farms,https://news.yahoo.com/something-not-southern-oregon-alarm-110045802.html

1/13/2022,"Senate Democrats thought Manchin had ultimately dropped his demands for a work requirement on the Biden child tax credit. But he's said he hasn't budged at all on the issue. It's thrown the fate of Biden's big social and climate bill into chaos with no clear path to success. Senate Democrats largely believed the heated clash around one of President Joe Biden's biggest economic priorities was behind them as fall turned to winter. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia imperiled the renewal of the expanded child tax credit in September when he started demanding work requirements as a condition for families to receive up to $300 in monthly checks per child, amounting to either $3,000 or $3,600 a year for younger kids. The program was put in place for a year under the stimulus law, transforming it into a near-universal cash benefit for parents until it expired in December. Though the vast majority of congressional Democrats back renewing the program as it is, Manchin's desired change carried enormous consequences. Imposing a work requirement would shut out many families with little or no taxable income, significantly denting its anti-poverty effects.  But Democrats need his vote in order to pass the centerpiece of Biden's domestic agenda to expand childcare, healthcare, and combat the climate emergency over universal GOP opposition in the 50-50 Senate. Manchin came out against the $2 trillion package and it's now stuck in the mud. To get Manchin to drop his push for a work requirement, Democrats and the White House made a huge compromise to try and get his support: They cut the planned extension for three years to only one, according to two Senate Democratic aides familiar with the matter. Both were granted anonymity to share details of private negotiations. The concession was included in the framework that the White House ultimately released in late October after weeks of negotiations with Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, another Democratic holdout.  ""I still do not understand what happened with this framework,"" one of the aides said. ""And it being communicated to pretty much everyone that the reason we were only doing [one-year] CTC was because that was the only way he would agree to do the CTC without work requirements."" The Biden administration's attempt to dislodge the stalled package landed with a thud. Manchin never publicly endorsed the White House plan and continued to hold back his support until he ultimately blew up the House-approved bill in December. ""I've tried everything humanly possible, I can't get there,"" he told Fox News. ""Senator Manchin has always supported the child tax credit and would like to see it targeted to those families who need it most,"" a Manchin spokesperson told Insider via email. The White House didn't respond to requests for comment. Manchin's claim that he wants the neediest families to get the aid runs counter to the demands he's laid out, since a work requirement would block payments to the poorest families. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, one of the architects of the expanded benefit, has told Insider recently that he's unsure that he'll get Manchin's support despite personally lobbying him on the issue. ""I don't think I'll ever convince Senator Manchin on this until he actually sees it in effect, working in his state benefiting the people of West Virginia, as it's benefiting the people of Colorado,"" Bennet said in an interview last month. ""That's a good reason for us to extend it for some years, so that we can see how it's working."" It's unclear what a potential compromise with Manchin could look like. Democrats could slash the size of the benefit so its cheaper or further restrict who can tap into the federal aid to satisfy his demands — but it still may not be enough to get him onboard. If it fell out of the Build Back Better plan, it's also unclear whether a bipartisan deal could be struck with the GOP since they're wary of any tax hikes to pay for it. ""No Republican, including myself, is going to say, 'Hey, I'm in favor of tax increases of any kind,"" Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the author of a competing child benefit plan, told Insider on Wednesday.  Read the original article on Business Insider",Politics/INSIDER,Senate Democrats offered Manchin a huge compromise on checks to parents.
