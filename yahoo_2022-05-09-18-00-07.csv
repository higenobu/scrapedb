5/9/2022,"(Reuters) -Following are quotes from a televised speech on Monday by President Vladimir Putin at Moscow's annual Victory Day parade on Red Square, translated from Russian to English by Reuters: ON SECURITY GUARANTEES DEMANDED BY PUTIN ""Despite disagreements in international relations, Russia has always advocated the creation of a system of equal and indivisible security, a system that is vital for the entire international community. ""In December last year, we proposed the conclusion of an agreement on security guarantees. Russia called on the West to enter an honest dialogue, in search of reasonable compromise solutions, to take each other’s interests into account. It was all in vain."" ""NATO countries did not want to listen to us, meaning that they in fact had entirely different plans, and we saw this. Openly, preparations were under way for another punitive operation in Donbas, the invasion of our historical lands, including Crimea. ""In Kyiv, they announced the possible acquisition of nuclear weapons, the NATO bloc began actively taking military control of territories adjacent to ours. As such, an absolutely unacceptable threat to us was systematically created, and moreover directly on our borders. ""Everything indicated that a clash with the neo-Nazis, the Banderites [Ukrainian Nazi sympathisers], backed by the United States and their junior partners, was inevitable."" ON DECISION TO LAUNCH 'SPECIAL MILITARY OPERATION' ""We saw military infrastructure being ramped up, hundreds of military advisers working and regular deliveries of modern weapons from NATO. (The level of) danger was increasing every day. Russia preventively rebuffed the aggressor. It was necessary, timely and ... right. The decision of a sovereign, strong, independent country."" ON EASTERN UKRAINE ""Today, the volunteers of the Donbas, together with the soldiers of the Russian Army, are fighting on their own lands ... ""I am now addressing our Armed Forces and the Donbas volunteers. You are fighting for the Motherland, for its future, so that no one forgets the lessons of the Second World War. So that there is no place in the world for executioners, punishers and Nazis."" ON MILITARY LOSSES ""The death of each one of our soldiers and officers is our shared grief and an irreparable loss for their friends and relatives. The state, regions, companies and public organisations will do everything to care for and help these families. We will give special support to the children of dead and wounded comrades. A Presidential Decree on this was signed today."" ON RUSSIA AND THE WEST ""The United States, especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union, began talking about its exclusivity, abasing not only the whole world but also its satellites, which have to pretend that they don't see anything and obediently swallow it up. But we are a different country. Russia has a different character. We will never abandon our love for the Motherland, our faith and traditional values, the customs of our ancestors and our respect for all peoples and cultures."" ""We know that American veterans who wanted to attend the parade in Moscow were practically barred from doing so. But I want them to know: we are proud of your exploits, your contribution to the common victory."" ""We honour all the soldiers of the allied armies – the Americans, the British, the French, the participants in the Resistance and the partisans of China – all those who defeated Nazism and militarism.""

5/9/2022,"STORY: Filipinos headed to the polls on Monday to elect a new president. The son and namesake of the nation's former dictator, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, is tipped to win the vote, 36 years after his father was driven out of office in a ""people power"" uprising. Marcos, popularly known as ""Bongbong"", is running against Vice President Leni Robredo. She's a former human rights lawyer and staunch liberal who's pledged to improve education and welfare. Marcos has presented no real policy platform but his presidency is expected to provide continuity from outgoing leader Rodrigo Duterte. Opinion polls put Marcos ahead of his rival by more than 30 percentage points, while Duterte's daughter is tipped to win the vice presidency. One voter told Reuters she hoped Filipinos would be discerning when choosing the next leaders. ""I hope people who are voting today are not being bought and that you vote because you know that the person you are voting for is the right leader. We Filipinos are facing a lot of hardships and we need a change of leadership, so I hope people will use their minds, their hearts and their intelligence to vote what is right."" Polls are due to close at 7pm local time and an unofficial vote count could give an indication of the winner within hours.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Philippines votes: Marcos family eyes return to power,https://news.yahoo.com/philippines-votes-marcos-family-eyes-074608271.html
