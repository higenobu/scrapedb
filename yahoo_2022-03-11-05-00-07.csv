3/11/2022,"A Fox News correspondent in Kyiv took issue Tuesday with suggestions made on air by colleague Greg Gutfeld that the media have been pushing a lopsided narrative on Ukraine to evoke an “emotional response” for profit. “Speaking as someone on the ground, I want to say that this is not the media trying to drum up some emotional response,” reporter Benjamin Hall said, evidently having heard Gutfeld’s comments on “The Five” shortly before he dialed in. “This is absolutely what’s happening. From the cities of Kharkiv to Mariupol to Chernigov, they are being absolutely flattened. And from all corners of this country, people are fleeing for safety.” “In the city of Mariupol, people are drinking water from puddles because the Russian forces haven’t allowed them to get out. When they have tried to get out, they are shelled.” “And don’t take it from my word, take it from the words of some of those who are trying to flee,” he added, cutting to footage of tearful civilians trying to escape. During a discussion about Russia’s targeting of Ukrainian civilians, Gutfeld questioned the news coverage of the conflict, suggesting it was being manipulated to try to create a reaction. “I can feel the galvanizing force of these stories that kind of have sped up and are accumulating to create a narrative,” the Fox News host said. “And they only go in one direction. And I understand why they only go in one direction, because it’s the invaded who experience the atrocity, right? And that’s all we’re going to see.” “However, I can’t help but feel that this is a lot like other stories that we’ve gone through in the Digital Age in which an image is taken and then played over and over and over again to create some kind of emotional response out of you, because that makes a profit for news companies, right?” he added. He then drew a link between coverage of Ukraine and media reporting on police brutality in 2020, which he implied was overblown and led to “a year of riots.” “Just because the news is pushing these videos at you doesn’t mean you gotta do something,” he said. He later responded to his colleague’s comments from the war zone, calling it a “cheap attack.” “Should I address Benjamin Hall’s cheap attack on me or be a good co-worker and let it slide?” he asked his colleague Dana Perino. “I will be the better man here,” he continued. “As I said before, when this started, we want the quickest end possible. My concern has always been, when a narrative creates a story that bolsters one side, that is out of its element, will you create more suffering?” More than 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded it two weeks ago, according to the United Nations. Hundreds of civilians have been killed in bombings as Russian ground and air forces push in on Ukrainian towns and cities. Ukrainian citizens and leaders have begged the world for military and humanitarian aid as the crisis unfolds. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/11/2022,"GOP Rep. Madison Cawthorn called President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a ""thug"" in a town hall last week. ""Remember that the Ukrainian government is incredibly corrupt and it is incredibly evil,"" he said. He condemned Putin's actions Thursday and said propaganda ""is being used to entice"" the US into war. Rep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a ""thug"" and Ukraine's government ""incredibly corrupt"" and ""incredibly evil"" during a townhall in his home state on Saturday. The first-term Republican lawmaker made the comments in Asheville, North Carolina. They were first reported in a Wall Street Journal opinion column on Wednesday. The local television station WRAL published a video of Cawthorn's remarks on Thursday. ""Remember that Zelenskyy is a thug,"" Cawthorn said. ""Remember that the Ukrainian government is incredibly corrupt and it is incredibly evil and it has been pushing woke ideologies."" Cawthorn's comments are at odds with prominent members of his party who have decried Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine and expressed support for Zelenskyy. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy during a press conference on Wednesday called Putin ""evil"" and a ""dictator."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell last week called Putin a ""ruthless thug."" A spokesperson for Cawthorn told Insider on Thursday that the lawmaker ""supports Ukraine and the Ukrainian President's efforts to defend their country against Russian aggression, but does not want America drawn into another conflict through emotional manipulation."" ""The Congressman was expressing his displeasure at how foreign leaders, including Zelensky, had recently used false propaganda to entice America into becoming involved in an overseas conflict,"" the spokesperson said, pointing to Cawthorn's tweet on Thursday. ""Propaganda is being used to entice America into another war,"" Cawthorn tweeted, along with a link to a Substack article about propaganda and misinformation in the Russia-Ukraine war. ""I do not want Americans dying because emotions pushed us into a conflict."" Cawthorn wrote in a follow-up tweet: ""The actions of Putin and Russia are disgusting. But leaders, including Zelensky, should NOT push misinformation on America. ""I am praying for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. Pray also we are not drawn into conflict based on foreign leaders pushing misinformation."" Some of Ukraine's official accounts have posted questionable and unverified information, according to The New York Times reported, but it's been mostly focused on ""heroes and martyrs"" in the war. Those claims also pale in comparison to the disinformation being spread by Russia, The Times added. The US has provided arms to Ukraine to fight Russia, but no American forces are engaged in the conflict. President Joe Biden has consistently said there are no plans to deploy US troops to the war.

3/11/2022,"Images and video of a Russian armored train have surfaced on social media. The train is armed with anti-aircraft cannons and equipped with protective armor. Armies have used armored trains for more than a century. An armored train—once thought to be an anachronism on today’s battlefield—has turned up in Ukraine. The Russian military train, featuring steel armor and equipped with anti-aircraft guns, rolled into occupied Ukraine allegedly on a humanitarian mission. The use of armored trains goes back more than 100 years, to their use in the Boer War in Africa. The train was first spotted on February 7 in Melitopol, Ukraine, which is currently under Russian control. The train, according to the Russian military’s Zvezda News, is evacuating foreign citizens. (This claim, like any Russian government claim, should be taken with a grain of salt.) Russia has four armored trains: Baikal, Amur, Terek, and Don. It retired the trains after the conclusion of the Second Chechen War in the early 2000s, but returned them to service in 2015. According to unconfirmed reports, the train spotted in occupied Ukraine is a combination of both Baikal and Amur. Here’s a video from Russian state media of the two trains participating in military exercises in 2016:
 The trains are armed with two pairs of ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft guns. The ZU-23-2 is a twin-barreled 23-millimeter manually operated anti-aircraft gun. The ZU-23-2 is aimed with an old-fashioned peephole gunsight and lacks modern features such as night vision, stabilization, and laser range-finding. The guns are likely used to protect the train from aircraft as well as ambushes from the ground. In addition to the guns, the trains are also typically equipped with tanks and infantry fighting vehicles tied down to flatbed railcars for extra firepower. A Russian railroad car typically travels with one T-62 main battle tank and one BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicle. The T-62 is obsolete by today’s standards, but it provides a 115-millimeter main gun and machine guns in a heavily armored package. The BMP-2 adds a 30-millimeter auto-cannon and a Konkurs anti-tank guided missile. The trains are heavily armored, with steel plating covering the rail cars, though it’s unclear how thick the armor is. It’s likely enough to shrug off small arms fire and perhaps even 12.7-millimeter heavy machine gun fire. Additional protection is provided by electronic jamming devices designed to prevent remote-controlled bombs placed on the railroad tracks from detonating. Russia’s Ministry of Defence Railway Troops operate the train. The Railway Troops were originally established in 1851 to construct and maintain train tracks, and coordinate and protect the movement of trains across Russia. At 5,600 miles long, Russia relies heavily on trains for the movement of civilian and military goods. Russia used armored trains during the Russian Civil War, World War I, and World War II. Armored trains have always had a serious flaw: if the railroad tracks are disabled, the train can’t advance. It seems likely that Ukrainian guerrillas and armed drones with precision-guided weapons, such as the TB-2 Bayraktar, will target train tracks to prevent Russia from using them to support the war effort. If that happens, Russia’s armored train could become much like the rest of Russia’s mechanized invasion force: stuck in place, unable to go forward, and unable to retreat.
