3/17/2022,"The gap through which Thiago Alcântara threaded his pass to Diogo Jota: a yard, at a generous estimate. The space that Jota found at Aaron Ramsdale’s near post to jam the ball in: maybe a couple of feet. The space in which Roberto Firmino had somehow to divert Andy Robertson’s cross past a goalkeeper literally standing next to him: a matter of inches. These are the margins that are taking Liverpool towards the top of the Premier League, and right now they are managing to find them better than anyone else. The match in summary: Arsenal were the better side for 50 minutes and did nothing with it. Liverpool were the better side for the next 15 minutes and killed the game comprehensively. As for the rest, who cares? Arsenal ran and rampaged and fumed and fought, just as they had done all night. But there is something heroically dispiriting about giving your best even when you know it is not remotely good enough. Arsenal are a team in chrysalis, still learning and developing. They were quick and hungry and inventive, passing the ball beautifully through midfield, showing desire and intent, getting themselves into good positions. But they couldn’t find the gaps. When a clinical finish or a pinpoint cross or a perfect through ball was required, they couldn’t locate it. Mikel Arteta has built an excellent playing machine. Jürgen Klopp, by contrast, has built a winning machine, and here the difference between the two was stark. Thomas Partey was scintillating in the first half but dropped his level in the second. Bukayo Saka was tireless on the right flank but made a crucial error that let Robertson in for Liverpool’s second goal. Martin Ødegaard played some brilliant passes but missed a golden opportunity to put Arsenal in the lead. Meanwhile, Jordan Henderson was excellent for 90 minutes. So was Alisson. So was Virgil van Dijk. That was the difference. It was a difference in demeanour, too. On the touchline Arteta was a picture of perpetual motion, pointing and waving, squeezing an imaginary accordion between his hands, urging more conviction, more running, more of everything. And for much of the game Arsenal were certainly the more kinetic team, all coiled energy and righteous fury. But somehow Liverpool were always the happier one, confident in their extra gears, their superior big-game nous, the Golden Boot winner sitting on their bench. There were signs early in the second half that Liverpool were on the move. There was a conscious effort to be tidier in possession, to get the ball down and play it through Arsenal rather than punting it over the top. It was from just such a pass that Thiago found Jota for the opening goal: a goal that sprang not just from immense technical quality but pure faith, faith in the method, belief in the plan. Jota scored and was hauled straight off for Firmino. The coldness! This is the other thing about Liverpool these days: in times past you might have sensed them getting a little jittery as the game reached the hour mark, nervously glancing over at the bench and wondering whether Xherdan Shaqiri would really be an upgrade on anything. Now they have a bench as good as any in Europe. Beat them once, and you then have to do it all over again. Firmino deftly flicked in the second goal and Liverpool saw out the game with few alarms. You could hardly blame them for pedalling down a little. This was Henderson’s 40th game of the season in all competitions, Jota’s 38th, Van Dijk’s 37th. These guys have played essentially an entire Premier League season by March. There is still a cup run and a European campaign to be pursued. And so what they have learned over the years is the ability to pace themselves, to harness their physical and emotional resources, to pare and slice away anything extraneous until only what is most essential remains. They hardly ever waste energy on a ruck. They press not with mindless abandon but with surgical precision, picking their moments and targets. This is a Liverpool side without an ounce of fat on it: no frills, no flourishes, no passengers. Will this hold true for the season as a whole? Certainly Liverpool look a more complete and consistent team than Manchester City right now: not quite as good at controlling games or creating chances, but certainly more efficient. Long before their plane touches down in the north-west, Arsenal will be forgotten. On to the next, and the next, and the next. In a title race that will be defined by the very finest of margins, it may just be enough.",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp refashions Liverpool into ruthlessly efficient team | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/16/nothing-wasted-in-jurgen-klopps-ruthlessly-efficient-liverpool
3/17/2022,"Toot! Toot! All aboard the Australian election boat! The ship captain today will be Scott Morrison, as you can tell from the adorable costume he’s wearing. He will also be your hairdresser, your waterboy and something vaguely industrial in sumptuous high-vis. Look! He’s even sweeping a basketball court! This is a man who has FUN HATS for every occasion. He loves beer, once posed like a recently smacked, shaved mammal in a barre class and he’ll be your uke-strummin’, ridgey-didge real Aussie bloke, your daggy dad and your father figure ’til the end of time. Or until the end of his reign as prime minister – although, dear god, doesn’t that seem just as freakin’ eternal? Why does the Australian prime minister affect more costume changes than a Ru Paul’s Drag Race cabaret act in an exploding dress factory? Because, uh, he wants you to know he’s not pretending to be anyone else. He actually said this – aloud! In front of a camera! – on an episode of Paul Murray Live. He was criticising the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, his rival in the upcoming election, for having the raw, transformative temerity to lose a bit of weight, get new glasses and buy some new suits. “I’m still wearing the same sunglasses,’’ Morrison insisted to Murray, “Sadly, the same suits. I weigh about the same size and I don’t mind a bit of Italian cake.” And then he repeated: “I’m not pretending to be anyone else.” It was an extraordinary claim, not only because it flew in the face of recorded-in-photography years of Morrison’s relentless costume parade of pretending to be literally anything apart from a head of government running a trillion-dollar economy at a time of war, environmental disaster and peril. It was also because Morrison’s own office has spoken of his “dramatic slimdown” to the media. The Daily Mail retrieved 2018 articles of Morrison accompanying his Liberal leadership victory with weight loss. Opposition MPs delighted in sharing news reports from the Australian – no less – of Morrison celebrating his 53rd birthday, less than a year ago, swapping out cake for a dieter’s “Man Shake”. Do I think Australia’s prime minister is a liar? To quote Emmanuel Macron – directly, he was talking about Morrison – “I don’t think, I know.” And so, apparently, do an increasing number of Australians, who have pounded Morrison’s standing in the polls, giving Albanese’s party a clear lead and even drawing the Labor leader dead equal to established-brand Morrison as preferred PM. More polls reveal he is considered Australia’s most untrustworthy prime minister since such a question was deemed necessary. Every day the obliged election draws closer, and it’s desperation driving Morrison deeper into the dress-up box – because the falsity used to work. In the context of years of democratic leaders trying to be all things to all people, Morrison’s “fauxgan” working-class drag act used to have electoral purchase because his pretence flattered the specific culture of the bulk of the voters around him. That was in 2019 – which is not just three years ago. It is a universe away. The effects of climate change are now burning Australia or flooding it. A new variant of the interminable pandemic is causing a global rise in hospitalisations. There is a land war in Europe involving a nuclear-armed dictatorship. These are serious times – and the idea of politics as entertainment has been a dead brand since the professional comedian leading Ukraine stopped belting piano keys with his knob, donned the khakis and took up arms in Kyiv. Albanese has claimed that being in car accident last year forced a reckoning with his mortality, prompting a health kick and weight loss. The more important awakening, perhaps, came a few months ago when – at the height of Morrison’s dithering about coronavirus management, even before his ineptitude with the floods – Albanese realised frustration with Morrison had grown so palpable he could actually win this thing. Was it Morrison’s observable failure to manage that gave Albanese confidence to eschew Labor’s historically unfortunate habit of making leaders indistinguishable from beige carpet as possible in the hope voters might trip and fall on to them? Morrison’s insistence that Albanese slim is less authentic than Albanese pudgy doesn’t work because Albo is an inner-city leftie who has finally – finally – decided to let himself look like one. You may not like the Labor leader – or be like him – but he’s telling you who he is. This marks him in stark comparison to Morrison who, like a desperate ex-boyfriend, is always pretending to be the person he thinks you want but is never there when he could be of any use. What waters lie ahead as the election ship sets sail, no one can say. Still in the captain’s hat, Scott Morrison plays with his props, sings a few songs and – unwisely – gets himself photographed with his cat. It’s clear he will do anything – anything at all – to insist you allow him to govern you – except the part of the job he likes least; governing.

3/17/2022,"One in three jobs will be slashed at the Australian Human Rights Commission as a record number of complaints and low base funding take their toll. The human rights agency has issued a blunt warning that its current funding “does not provide us with the resources required to perform our statutory functions”. The commission handles complaints under federal discrimination and human rights law, providing a check on government over issues including offshore detention and Covid-19 border restrictions. Rosalind Croucher, the president of the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC), first raised the alarm that the commission was in deficit in the 2020-21 annual report, saying the AHRC faced “significant capacity constraints in dealing with the dramatic increase in complaint numbers over the past year”. The commission’s work has “increased substantially because of the Covid-19 pandemic”, she said. Further detail from the AHRC suggests this “surge” in complaints amounts to an 85% increase in the past two years compared with the average over the previous five. The AHRC’s annual core funding was slashed from $22.9m to $14.6m in 2017-18 when it shifted from receiving a direct appropriation to grants through the attorney general’s department. The Australian National Audit Office has noted that since 2017 the AHRC has run deficits, leading to net debt of $5.4m by June 2021 when the AHRC recognised “we were facing a cashflow problem”. “We had been operating in recent years with a staffing level above what we can afford,” the AHRC told Guardian Australia. The AHRC received an additional $16m in the 2021-22 mid-year economic and fiscal update. But its core funding of $16.5m a year pays for 76 staff, not the 144 it estimates are required to handle complaints. Since July, the AHRC has saved about $1.8m through “immediate budget controls” and cutting 18% of jobs, the agency said. “To operate within our current appropriation, we estimate we would need to reduce our staffing levels further (by about 33% from July 2021).” “We commenced the process of a further reduction in our staffing levels in March.” The AHRC noted the Productivity Commission “has a similar level of statutory office holders” and 169 staff, with a budget of $33.3m. “The commission is committed to working with the attorney general’s department and department of finance to ensure that we are adequately and reliably resourced to deliver against our statutory obligations into the future.” Labor’s shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said “the damage done to the [AHRC] by the Liberals is a shocking indictment of the Morrison government, and further evidence of their contempt for honesty and accountability”. “The commission plays a vital role in our nation holding governments to account, and defending the human rights of all Australians, and is too important to be treated as yet another place for the Liberals to wage their culture wars.” The attorney general’s department said funding for the AHRC “is considered as part of budget processes”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The government has provided an equity injection of $16m to assist the commission to address the cashflow problem it is currently experiencing and return it to a sustainable financial footing,” it said. “The appropriation of the commission to perform its core functions has been steady over recent years. The commission also receives additional funding to undertake work on specific projects.” The AHRC has been a persistent check on the Coalition government, criticising its attempts to keep national cabinet deliberations secret and to restore its power to deport Aboriginal non-citizens. In 2017 the outgoing AHRC president, Gillian Triggs, accused the then Turnbull government of being “ideologically opposed to human rights”, saying Australia’s human rights are “regressing on almost every front”. Anti-corruption experts have argued the government must improve the resourcing of bodies including the Australia National Audit Office, AHRC and the office of the information commissioner to improve scrutiny.",News/Australia news,Australian Human Rights Commission to slash staff after budget cuts and surge in workload,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/17/australian-human-rights-commission-to-slash-staff-after-budget-cuts-and-surge-in-workload
3/17/2022,"The online safety bill is a landmark piece of legislation that aims to stop damage to people online, ranging from racist tweets to the harmful content sent by powerful algorithms. The revised bill, published on Thursday, will impose a duty of care on tech firms to protect users from harmful content, or face large fines from the communications watchdog. The Guardian has spoken to people who have suffered from the kind of damage that the bill is trying to prevent and penalise. Miller is clear about the motivation for the online hatred she has suffered over the years: “It was a torrent of abuse that came from my being a woman of colour.” The transparency campaigner says the abuse began in 2015 when she highlighted concerns over the financial and charity sectors. This escalated when she spearheaded successful court cases against the government’s actions over Brexit. She says Facebook and Twitter were the worst platforms for hosting racist messages. “The messages that were posted ranged from things like saying ‘Go back home you dirty foreigner’ to ‘This woman should be killed’,” says Miller, who was born in British Guiana, now Guyana, to parents of Indian descent. Miller welcomes the fact that the bill will criminalise digital “pile-ons” where victims are subjected to abuse online from multiple people simultaneously. It will also ensure that big tech platforms prioritise tackling specific types of “legal but harmful” content, which is expected to include racist abuse. Molly, 14, from Harrow in north-west London, viewed content on Instagram and other social media platforms linked to anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide before taking her own life in November 2017. Her father, Ian, says social media platforms have been allowed to regulate themselves, a laissez-faire approach that failed his family. “Social media has been allowed to evolve in a self-regulated manner. That clearly does not work, otherwise tragedies like Molly’s would not have happened.” Ian says social media has shown its “good side” recently with its role in the coronavirus pandemic and the Ukraine conflict, but young people need greater protection when using platforms. “We need regulation so that when young people use social media, which they should do, because it does tremendous good, that they are protected from the harm it can cause.” The legislation, which applies to tech firms that produce user-generated content as well as search engines, will require companies to put in place systems that spot illegal content, such as posts that promote or facilitating suicide. Platforms will also need to ensure that their algorithms, which curate what a user sees, do not target vulnerable users with inappropriate content. Scam adverts will be included in the scope of the bill, meaning that the largest social media platforms will be required to prevent paid-for fraudulent adverts appearing on their sites. This includes adverts carrying fake celebrity endorsements. It will be too late for Jill, a retired psychotherapist living in Cambridgeshire. Jill, who asked for her surname to be withheld, lost more than £30,000 in 2020 after clicking on an advert on Facebook for a cryptocurrency investment carrying a fake “endorsement” from the Dragons’ Den star Deborah Meaden. “It’s terribly distressing and it all started with one small advert on Facebook. They need to police these adverts,” she says. “It affected my family because they were very upset and angry. It cast a cloud over us for a couple of years.” Meaden has said in a statement on her website that she has no association with – or made investments in – bitcoin trading platforms. “I have taken steps to get the unauthorised material removed and am taking appropriate action on the individuals and/or companies who have decided to scam people in this way,” she wrote. Scott says she encountered online content as a teenager that encouraged her eating disorder, including people posting ideas for extreme diets. “From the ages of 14-18, I would access a lot of harmful content on Tumblr and Instagram. This content was often referred to as pro-anorexia content, which was essentially a community of people encouraging each other to participate in dangerous behaviour,” says Scott, from Reading. “Viewing this content online made me feel less aware of how dangerous my behaviour was. It felt like an external manifestation of the disorder that was already in my head.” Scott says there needs to be a dedicated effort to prevent this content from being so widely accessible. She says similar content still exists on social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram. “There needs to be more done than just shutting down and reporting accounts that promote eating disorders. The accounts need to be identified sooner, with more of an emphasis on keeping on top of new hashtags or spaces developing.” The list of legal but harmful content that the government expects tech firms to tackle will be set out in secondary legislation. But the press release accompanying the revised bill indicates that content relating to self-harm and eating disorders will be among the areas covered. Frida says social media platforms left her vulnerable to being groomed online at 13, after a man in his 30s contacted her on Facebook. The resulting online relationship lasted for years, an experience that left Frida with long-term depression. “At the time, I was really miserable at school. I was getting bullied and didn’t really have any friends, so I didn’t have anything to lose,” says Frida, whose name has been changed. She says there were few safeguarding regulations at Facebook to protect her from the abuse. “There were increased risks with things like end-to-end encryption, for example, or the fact that my abuser was able to so easily add and message me, and cross-platform risk.” She says the initial contact on Facebook soon moved to messaging on WhatsApp – which is encrypted, meaning the messages can be viewed only by the sender and recipient. “So much of what I interacted with on Facebook left me at risk,” says Frida, who has campaigned with the NSPCC, the child protection charity, to strengthen the bill. “What I’d like to see in this online safety bill is more focus on risk and what increases risk. I’d like to see a culture of safety by design being implemented on apps like Facebook.” The bill’s duty of care is split into several parts, including a requirement to protect children from illegal activity such as grooming. Tech companies will have to carry out risk assessments detailing how abuse could occur on their platforms and how to prevent it. These risk assessments will be overseen by Ofcom, the communications watchdog, which has been charged with implementing the legislation.",News/Society,‘A torrent of abuse’: victims pin hopes on UK online safety bill,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/16/a-torrent-of-abuse-victims-pin-hopes-on-uk-online-safety-bill
3/17/2022,"In Gareth Southgate’s own words, Jadon Sancho did not deserve an England call-up for last October’s World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Hungary and yet the manager selected him regardless. Sancho was enduring a difficult time at Manchester United after his £73m transfer from Borussia Dortmund and, given his form, he ought not to have been included. But Southgate had invested in the winger, who he believes can get to the very top, and he decided “for him to feel we have belief in him at this point is a good message”. Sancho’s previous action for England had been to miss one of the penalties in the Euro 2020 final shootout loss to Italy in July – he was injured for the September fixtures – and Southgate wanted to get him back in the shirt, partly to begin the healing process. Sancho would get two assists in the 5-0 win over Andorra. Things would get worse for Sancho before they got better. His performances for United did not improve in time for the November internationals and Southgate dropped him, saying that he could not support him for ever. But Sancho has since turned it around at United, playing some strong games, and Southgate is expected to recall him on Thursday for this month’s Wembley friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast. The reason for bringing up the Sancho situation is because it has direct relevance to Southgate’s biggest selection dilemma: whether to call up Marcus Rashford. The parallels are clear. Rashford is enduring a torrid time at United and, given his form, does not merit being selected. The forward has been so frustrated by his lack of minutes under the club’s interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, that he has given thought to leaving Old Trafford. Rangnick’s response? “Even suppose he and his agents or his family at one stage of the summer think about maybe going to another club, well then he can do that but in the summer,” Rangnick said. “Now the window is closed.” Rashford’s last action for England was to miss one of the penalties against Italy because a shoulder operation and fitness issues ruled him out of the autumn international programme. He would benefit hugely from a change of environment, a show of support from Southgate, and the manager knows it. He loves Rashford, has counted on him as one of his key lieutenants and his empathetic side will want to pick him. But can he do so given the competition in wide attacking areas? Never mind Raheem Sterling, Bukayo Saka, Jack Grealish, Phil Foden and Sancho, there is an argument that Southgate ought to recall Harvey Barnes, who is playing well at Leicester. He won his only cap as a substitute in the friendly against Wales in October 2020. Southgate has other headaches, of course, as he prepares for the final friendlies before the World Cup in Qatar and, perhaps, the last opportunity for any experimentation. England have only two more camps before the tournament – in June and September, when they play four and two Nations League ties respectively. Harry Maguire is another United player horribly out of sorts and he suffered a blow to his already brittle confidence when the club’s fans cheered his substitution in Tuesday’s Champions League exit against Atlético Madrid. Southgate remains behind the centre-half and he will select him but expect Maguire’s lack of form to be a hot topic – as it was last November. Southgate has injury problems in the wing-back roles, mainly on the left, with Ben Chilwell out for the season after cruciate surgery and Luke Shaw having missed United’s past three matches. Kieran Trippier, who can provide an option on the left, is out with a fractured metatarsal. Shaw is back in training and should be called up but he would be unlikely to start in both games, leading Southgate to consider the merits of Newcastle’s Matt Targett and Crystal Palace’s Tyrick Mitchell. Southgate’s assistant, Steve Holland, watched Palace’s 0-0 draw against Manchester City on Monday night, in which Mitchell excelled. On the other flank, Reece James is struggling with a muscular issue – he has missed Chelsea’s past three games – and the midfielder Kalvin Phillips is out, raising the chances of Conor Gallagher being picked. Southgate must also consider whether he has room to recall Ben White in central defence and Ollie Watkins up front. Tammy Abraham, who has scored 15 goals in 21 games for Roma since the November international break, continues to look like Southgate’s first change for Harry Kane. Abraham hopes to start one of the matches.",Sport/Football,The Rashford dilemma: how will Southgate solve selection headache? | David Hytner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/16/the-rashford-dilemma-how-will-southgate-solve-selection-headache
3/17/2022,"Ministers will drop the term black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME), beef up local scrutiny of police stop and search and draft a model history curriculum to teach Britain’s “complex” past in response to the Sewell report on racial disparities. Launched as a response to the Black Lives Matter protests, the Sewell report caused controversy when it was published last year for broadly rejecting institutional racism as an explanation for many of the challenges faced by ethnic minorities in the UK. In the government’s response, called Inclusive Britain, ministers acknowledge that racism exists but stress the importance of other factors, too. Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, said: “I strongly believe that Britain is the fairest and most open-minded country in the world, but there is more we can do to foster inclusion and enable everyone to reach their full potential.” She added: “The causes behind racial disparities are complex and often misunderstood. Our new strategy is about action, not rhetoric, and will help create a country where a person’s race, social or ethnic background is no barrier to achieving their ambitions.” Taiwo Owatemi, Labour’s shadow equalities minister, said: “It’s disgraceful that we’ve had to wait almost a year for the government’s response – and worse still that it agrees with the original report’s denial of structural racism. Boris Johnson’s Conservatives have once again failed to deliver meaningful action.” Inclusive Britain recommends dropping the term BAME across government, as it is too much of a catch-all, and gathering more fine-grained data to inform future policymaking. The report sets out a long list of other policies, some new and others already in place. These include the Home Office working with police and crime commissioners to draw up a new framework to ensure that police powers, including stop and search and the use of force, are subject to more scrutiny by local communities. Another plan, which had been trailed by the education minister, Robin Walker, is to draw up a “model curriculum” to “help pupils understand the intertwined nature of British and global history, and their own place within it”. To be developed by 2024 by a panel of historians and school leaders, the materials in the curriculum will not be compulsory, but will “stand as an exemplar for a knowledge-rich, coherent approach to the teaching of history”. Sewell’s report was amended last year after a backlash over its suggestion that there was a new story to be taught about the “slave period”, which was not just about “profit and suffering”. A footnote was added to clarify: “This is to say that in the face of the inhumanity of slavery, African people preserved their humanity and culture. This includes the story of slave resistance.” Other plans in the Inclusive Britain report include publishing new guidance for employers about how to implement positive discrimination policies in the workplace and convening a new Inclusion at Work Panel made up of experts to examine workplace equality training. The Department for Education, working with the race disparity unit in the Cabinet Office, will also look at what lessons can be learned from the multi-academy schools trusts that are “most successful at bridging achievement gaps for different ethnic groups and raising overall life chances”. Existing government policies on everything from using more out-of-court disposals to deal with first-time drug users to tackling online safety are also included. Badenoch was moved into Michael Gove’s Levelling Up department last September, taking the equalities brief with her. Launching Inclusive Britain, Gove suggested that tackling racial disparities is part of his levelling up agenda. “Central to Levelling Up is equality – giving everyone the same access to a great education, a well-paid job and a good standard of living – regardless of their background,” he said. Tony Sewell, chief executive of the educational charity Generating Genius, welcomed the government’s response to his report, saying: “This is a major step towards a fairer, more open and more inclusive society and, importantly, focuses on the practical actions that will improve people’s lives.” The Sewell report was commissioned when the government came under intense pressure to respond to the groundswell of support for the Black Lives Matter movement in the UK in summer 2020, with protests across many cities after the death of George Floyd at the hands of US police. After its publication, it was reported that large parts of the report – in particular the denial that institutional or structural racism exist – had been authored by No 10.",News/World news,UK government to scrap ‘BAME’ in response to race inquiry,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/uk-government-scrap-bame-response-sewell-race-inquiry
