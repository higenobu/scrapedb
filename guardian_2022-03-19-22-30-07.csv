3/19/2022,"Joe Sheehan can remember the attendance at his first match in charge of Ipswich Town Women without hesitation. It was about three years ago and they were playing Brantham Athletic in the quarter-finals of the Suffolk County Cup: there were 32 fans watching and, while nobody would sniff at a 14-0 win, an appearance at the equivalent stage nationally felt some way off. On Sunday, though, Ipswich will be there: they host West Ham in the last eight of the FA Women’s Cup and the sellout attendance at their home ground, in nearby Felixstowe, will total about 2,000. They lead the National League South, one of the third tier’s two branches, and the Hammers’ visit is the latest show of progress for one of the UK’s most progressive operations. Ipswich are a Championship club in waiting and potentially much more: it will be a chance to show that to the country, given the tie will be screened live, and perhaps a reminder that the league system needs shaking up to give its more impressive setups the opportunity to flourish. There are no guarantees Ipswich will top their division, to which they were only promoted last season: Southampton and Oxford are offering stern competition and the smart money would be on a contest with the Saints going to the final weekend. But even if they do, they would then have to play off with the winners of National League North – likely to be Wolves – for a sole promotion spot. It means only one team out of 27 can be successful and there is a sense that the lack of fluidity is doing the game no favours. “I can speak passionately on behalf of ourselves, Southampton and Wolves because I know the work we’re doing and the challenges we’re all facing,” Sheehan says. “To a certain extent I want us all to do well as I know what we’ve all been striving to do. I want us all to get an opportunity to fulfil our vision at some stage. The thought of any of us missing out over the next few years, based on what we’re trying to contribute to the growth of the sport in the long term, would sadden me.” Last summer, 10 of Ipswich’s players signed professional contracts. It is almost unheard of at their level but this is not a case of throwing the chequebook around. The core of a vibrant, technically fluent side have come through their youth setup, which received a Women’s Super League academy licence in 2018, and Sheehan can call upon the best talent in the eastern region. “That’s the foundation of our success,” he says. “We’re an area of the country that, for many years, had limited opportunities. We’ve managed to recruit really well, develop players, give them opportunities for senior football and give them a platform to represent England. Now we’re in a position where we’re proving we can sustain the success we’ve had for quite a few years.” In 2019-20 Ipswich, then in the fourth tier, reached the fifth round of the cup and faced Manchester City. Their run was comprehensively halted but Sheehan never felt it would be a flash in the pan. “I’m not surprised this has happened again, two years on, because I know the good work we’ve all been doing and the consistency,” he says. “And it’s only going to get better from here.” Two of Ipswich’s most exciting players, Sophie Peskett and the captain, Blue Wilson, have been sidelined with long-term injuries. But West Ham will have to watch Anna Grey, a supremely talented winger, as well as the forwards Zoe Barratt and Natasha Thomas. The first two both scored in last weekend’s win at Cardiff – the away attendance of which, notes Sheehan, was well above 32 – and the aim is that this group can reach the top together. For that, promotion will be necessary. “It’s something we hope will change,” Sheehan says of the blockage between the second and third levels. “We’ve got an ambitious group of players and staff, and we could have really positive seasons over the next two or three years and still miss out. What that would do for our players, wondering if they can make the jump themselves with us, would be something they’d have to consider.” In front of that big crowd, against a strong West Ham side that are sixth in the Women’s Super League, they have the opportunity to make their case again. “We’ll try to compete physically and we’ll have to match their athleticism,” Sheehan says. “We’ll need to adapt really quickly, stay in the game and impose ourselves while nullifying them as best we can. If we can do that, with our support, then who knows what surprises it can throw up?”",Sport/Football,Ipswich Women ready to show their mettle against West Ham in FA Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/19/ipswich-women-ready-to-show-their-mettle-against-west-ham-in-fa-cup
3/19/2022,"Elon Musk may not be a diplomat but, as everyone knows, he is a genius. And, true to form, the man has come up with a genius way to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. (The United Nations, I hope you’re listening!) Here we go … he wants to fight Vladimir Putin. Just him and Putin, man-to-man, battling it out. “I hereby challenge [Vladimir Putin] to single combat,” Musk tweeted on Monday. “Stakes are [Ukraine].” Putin was a little too busy committing war crimes to reply but, don’t worry, Musk still got the attention he so desperately craves. On Tuesday, the billionaire shared a post from the messaging app Telegram written by Ramzan Kadyrov, the pro-Putin head of the Chechen Republic. Kadyrov told Musk that he was in a completely different league from Putin and needed to “pump up those muscles in order to change from the gentle (effeminate) Elona into the brutal Elon you need to be”. Not one to let a humanitarian crisis distract him from a bit of banter Musk then changed his display name on Twitter from “Elon Musk” to “ElonaMusk“. (He has since changed it back.) All of this is completely idiotic, of course, but I have to admit that Musk is on to something here. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we replaced wars with wrestling matches between world leaders? Instead of killing innocent civilians, leaders could just duke it out among themselves. They get to stroke their egos and feel like Real Men™ without everyone else paying for it. It’s a nice idea but, of course, it’s impossible to imagine it ever actually happening. You know what else is impossible to imagine? A real life Elona Musk. There could simply never be a female version of Musk. A woman could never act the childish way that Musk acts and still be revered as a brilliant entrepreneur. A female CEO could never get away with spending half her day shitposting on Twitter and cracking juvenile jokes in the way that Musk does. People wouldn’t take her seriously. That’s not just my hypothesis – research shows that women are routinely held to far higher standards than men. A Rockefeller Foundation-commissioned study, for example, found 80% of news reports about female CEOs involved in a crisis cited the CEO as the problem. When a man was CEO, however, only 31% of stories blamed him for the company’s issues. In a similar vein, a 2016 study found female lawyers receive far harsher punishments than their male counterparts for ethical violations at work. The study looked at disciplinary punishments handed out by the American Bar Association and found that women had a 106% higher likelihood of being disbarred than a man for committing the same ethical infraction. And even women in prison get held to higher standards than men in prison: across the US women are disciplined at higher rates than men for smaller infractions of prison rules. Even if a hypothetical Elona Musk didn’t spend half her time insulting people with names like “pedo guy”, engaging in possible violations of securities law, and firing off sexist tweets about “TITS”, it’s unlikely she’d be lauded as a genius in the way Elon is. We are socially conditioned to think of brilliance and genius as male traits. Indeed a 2017 study found that girls as young as six are more likely to associate brilliance with the opposite sex. That builds on previous research which found parents and teachers attribute good marks in maths to hard work for girls, but to natural ability for boys. A certain sort of person is constantly going on about how it would be great to have more women in power, but it’s really important not to lower the bar. Here’s the thing: the bar is a hell of a lot lower for men than it is for women. It’s easier to imagine Mars being colonized in our lifetimes than an Elona Musk being taken seriously. Last year, Texas introduced an extreme abortion law that gave private citizens the right to sue anyone who aided or abetted an abortion for at least $10,000 in “statutory damages”. Since then, a number of Republican-led states have seemingly been in competition to try to come up with even more dystopian legislation. Leading the charge is Idaho, which has just passed a bill that would effectively allow certain family members of a “preborn child” to veto an abortion and sue anyone who aids or abets an abortion for damages starting at $20,000. As Slate reports: “The bill’s sponsor, Republican state Representative Steven Harris, has confirmed that if a rapist has 10 siblings, each can sue for $20,000.” Essentially then, the legislation financially incentivizes rape. And this wasn’t even seen as particularly controversial: the bill was passed in the Idaho House of Representatives in a 51-to-14 vote. The governor is excepted to sign it into a law, and it may go into effect next month. Yoon Suk-yeol exploited the country’s heated gender wars in order to gain support from angry young male voters. It worked: he won a tightly contested election last week. However, Yoon might not be able to turn back the clock on women’s rights as he much as he had hoped. One of the president-elect’s big campaign promises was abolishing the government’s ministry of gender equality and family – however, that requires approval from parliament, which is controlled by the Democratic party. And they’ve just appointed as its new interim leader a 26-year-old feminist who has been very critical of Yoon’s policies. According to a YouGov survey commissioned by the dating app, 74% of adults think that, when it comes to romantic relationships and dating, different behaviours are expected based on your gender identity. People still expect men to take the lead, for example. And 33% of women said they had changed their behaviour to make someone feel more powerful while dating or in a relationship Time for some good mews, I reckon! So, please meet Stepan: a 13-year-old tabby cat with more than a million followers on TikTok. Stepan and his owner, Anna, are Ukrainian but recently managed to escape to safety in France. “When you’ve got that many followers you can use them as a network to provide aid, find shelter or even help find escape routes in a war zone,” a humanitarian expert told the Washington Post. “Having an online network will help you survive difficult times.” Someone should probably tell the kids in Yemen that if they just get an Instagram-famous cat the world might give more of a damn about them, eh?

3/19/2022,"Spearheading the pop-punk revival is Machine Gun Kelly. Signed to P Diddy’s Bad Boy Records, he flipped from rap to pop-punk on his 2020 album Tickets to My Downfall. Now comes new LP Mainstream Sellout (a bit on the nose, but we are where we are). You may also have seen him across the internet in the showiest of showmances with actor Megan Fox. The mastermind behind MGK’s sound is Travis Barker, ubiquitous producer and drummer, best known for Blink-182. Barker’s bandmate Tom DeLonge has made news with his investigations into aliens, including the series Unidentified: Inside America’s UFO Investigation (Sky/Now). Steven Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind remains an indelible UFO story. Improbably, it features New Wave director François Truffaut. One of his final works was the 1980 wartime drama The Last Metro, with Catherine Deneuve and Gérard Depardieu. In 1990, long before his Russian passport and a pivot to Putin, Depardieu tried to break America via the romcom Green Card, opposite Andie MacDowell. More recently, MacDowell appeared with her daughter Margaret Qualley in the Netflix drama Maid. Another Maid actor is Raymond Ablack, who was in the 2000s iteration of Degrassi, the Canadian teen drama, alongside pre-rap Drake. Later TV forays for Drake include executive producer on Top Boy and Euphoria. Starring in the latter is Maude Apatow, daughter of Judd who put his family in This Is 40, which also featured Megan Fox – as seen with Machine Gun Kelly (who also appeared with Maude in Judd’s The King of Staten Island).

3/19/2022,"Tributes have been paid to Baby Cino, an aspiring rapper from Miami, who was shot and killed in a daylight ambush minutes after leaving a city jail on Wednesday. The 20-year-old vocalist, whose real name was Timothy Starks, was arrested by Miami-Dade officers at 2am in Opa-locka, Florida on Tuesday after they pulled him over for driving with an obscured number plate. On searching his car, police found a fully loaded Glock 32 pistol. He was released on bond on a gun charge and left the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center at 2pm on Wednesday. He was picked up by a friend, Dante Collins Banks, in a red Nissan car. When they turned on to the Palmetto expressway, a gunman in another vehicle opened fire on them in the middle of traffic. Starks was shot in the head and died at the scene. Banks was wounded in the stomach and transported to the Jackson Memorial hospital where he remains in a stable condition. Detectives have not identified a suspect but told the Miami Herald that “a dark-coloured vehicle was seen fleeing the area at a high rate of speed”. Starks was only identified on Friday as the victim of the shooting. On hearing of his death, one fan wrote on Twitter: “Damn they killed baby cino soon as he got out.” Another posted: “Thats crazy how Baby Cino died smh, someone was watching his ass leaving jail.” “Detectives are looking at every motive or every bit of information based on the evidence they have here at the scene,” the Miami-Dade police detective Angel Rodriguez told the local TV channel WPLG. “As you can see, the car has a significant amount of bullet holes.” Law-enforcement sources told the Herald that the shooting was being investigated for links to a series of public ambushes in recent months that are thought to be connected to Miami street gangs. Starks was believed to be associated with a gang known as “Boss Life” in the Little Haiti area of Miami. His best-known song, a track titled Big Haiti Shottas, features him and an entourage rapping about violence at a local apartment building. The lyrics include the lines: “Spot ’em, I got ’em/If it’s an issue or a problem, we’ll pull up with them choppers/We’ll leave him dead on the scene/Hell na he ain’t making it to the doctor.” The accompanying music video was dedicated to Gary “Melo” Laguerre, an 18-year-old murdered in a drive-by shooting in 2020.",News/US news,Miami rapper Baby Cino shot dead after leaving prison,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/19/miami-rapper-baby-cino-shot-dead-after-leaving-prison
3/19/2022,"When Phelim McDermott’s spectacular funfair production of Mozart’s Così fan tutte opened at the London Coliseum in 2014 the consensus was that while it was a joy to look at, it was too keen to skate over the disturbing cruelties that lurk within the piece. Eight years on, the world has moved into an altogether darker place, with quite enough cruelty of its own, so keeping it light and frothy suddenly seems an altogether more attractive option. This co-production with McDermott’s endlessly inventive “skills ensemble” Improbable brings all the fun of the fair springing on to the stage right from the overture. Fire-eaters, strong men, acrobats and contortionists produce playful placards that tell us that there will be big arias in this story of love and betrayal, so please concentrate – in other words, we are not taking this too seriously. We find Ferrando and Guglielmo in a Bunny Club, betting with sleazy Don Alfonso that their fiancees would never be unfaithful to them. To prove it they agree to disguise themselves and woo each other’s lover. Cue instant transformation to designer Tom Pye’s dazzling 1950s Coney Island, complete with ferris wheel, candyfloss, hotdogs, fortune tellers and freak-show posters. Sisters Fiordiligi and Dorabella, in knitwear and bobbysocks, have their stay at the grotty Skyline motel constantly interrupted by their “new” amorous suitors, in the manner of a Feydeau farce, with the circus troupe always on hand to move walls or set in motion a glorious selection of brightly coloured fairground rides. It’s beautifully executed, always eye-catching and thoroughly entertaining, but it sometimes rides roughshod over Mozart’s subtly sophisticated music. And there is a lack of firepower in some of the cast, with baritone Benson Wilson as Guglielmo and tenor Amitai Pati (making his British debut as Ferrando) both losing necessary heft at crucial moments. But opposite them, soprano Nardus Williams as Fiordiligi and mezzo Hanna Hipp as Dorabella sing with punch and grace. Williams copes well with the dramatic leaps and plunges of her Act 1 aria, even while mayhem is going on all around her, and Hipp develops deliciously from frosty to flirty. However, the best singing of the night comes from schemers Don Alfonso (baritone Neal Davies, in wonderfully spivvy form) and the mischievous motel chambermaid Despina. Soraya Mafi’s bright, agile soprano really cuts through, and her dancing skills are a wonder to behold. Regrettably the fizz and fun on stage isn’t matched in the pit, with conductor Kerem Hasan’s tempi often too stately to give a proper boost to this otherwise wildly colourful, imaginative production. The visit to the Barbican last week by the Czech Philharmonic – the first international orchestra to appear there since the pandemic began – was always going to be momentous, but the war in Ukraine raised its significance to boiling point. Czechs know at first hand about Russian invasion, so their impassioned playing of the Ukrainian national anthem felt personal. It drew roars of approval, as did their Russian-born conductor Semyon Bychkov’s short speech in which he condemned the war and dedicated the orchestra’s two concerts to the people of Ukraine. In his supremely individual Glagolitic Mass, played on the second evening, Leoš Janáček used ancient church Slavonic text (“glagolitic”) to underscore his desire to celebrate all Slavic people. It’s music that knows no political boundaries, and in the hands of the Czechs, with superb support from the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra Chorus, and laser-like tenor Aleš Briscein notable among the soloists, it more than achieved the composer’s wish that it would be “festive, life-affirming, pantheistic, with little of what we could call the ecclesiastical”. There was everything life-affirming about Bychkov’s joyous reading of Dvořák’s eighth symphony. The orchestra’s famed warmth of tone and clarity of texture glowed throughout, with the lower strings finding a delicious sonority in the romping first movement. Bychkov drew some careful phrasing in the adagio, before bringing an irresistible lilt to the waltz of the third movement and driving the wild folk dance of the finale, with fine solos from silvery flute and blasting trumpet. BBC Radio 3 will broadcast this sensational music-making on 5 May. Put it in the diary; you won’t be disappointed.
