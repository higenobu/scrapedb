12/24/2021,"WASHINGTON (AP) — North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn and his wife, Cristina Bayardelle, are divorcing after about a year of marriage, citing the difficulty of “balancing the enormity” of transitioning to a congressman's life, according to a statement tweeted Wednesday by Cawthorn’s spokesperson. The 26-year-old ally of former President Donald Trump became the youngest member of Congress last year after his election to the vacant 11th District seat previously held by Mark Meadows. Cawthorn announced last month he will run in a new congressional district, a seat that is friendlier to Republicans. The couple married in April on the anniversary of a 2014 crash that left him partially paralyzed, months after they were legally wed in December 2020, news outlets reported. While they agreed he should run, their lives changed overnight after his election, Cawthorn said in his statement. “From the outset, we committed to make things work, to fight for our marriage, and seek counsel for balancing the enormity of such a transition in life,” he said. “Together, we realized that balance was not attainable, and that we had irreconcilable differences between us.” Bayardelle said in a statement that she did not plan on the effect his political career would have on their relationship, WJZY-TV reported. “I want to live in the world he creates, I just don’t want to be married to someone changing the world,” she said. “While we have agreed to be apart now, we still have a great friendship and there’s no ill-will. Madison is a fighter — he will help save this country.”",Politics/Associated Press,"US Rep.

12/24/2021,"BLACK RIVER FALLS – A ""massive crash"" involving 40-50 vehicles closed a portion of Interstate 94 Thursday in western Wisconsin, according to the Jackson County Sheriff's Office. Authorities received a report of a crash around 5:45 a.m. Thursday on Interstate 94 near Hixton, according to the Wisconsin State Patrol. Multiple crashes, vehicles running off the road and jack-knifed semis occurred due to freezing rain and icy roads. When emergency personnel arrived on scene, they found a semitruck was on fire in the median with two passenger vehicles underneath. Multiple secondary crashes and runoffs occurred in the same area, the State Patrol said. Passengers of the vehicles were transported by bus to a safe location. Lt. Tim Weiberg of the Wisconsin State Patrol said that about 40 to 50 cars were involved in the incident. There were no fatalities and only minor injuries reported, he said Thursday afternoon. They hope to get both lanes open by early evening. As of 1 p.m. Thursday, portions of Interstate 94 were still closed because of the crashes. The eastbound lanes are closed from Eau Claire County HH in Foster to State 121 in Northfield. The westbound lane of I-94 is closed between U.S. 10 in Osseo to U.S. 12/State 27 in Black River Falls. Traffic in both lanes is being rerouted. The Wisconsin State Patrol office in Eau Claire reported icy conditions along I-94 in Jackson, Eau Claire and Dunn counties.

12/24/2021,"Jurors are still deciding Ghislaine Maxwell's fate, set to resume deliberations on Monday. One juror question indicates they're scrutinizing the reliability of one accuser, Carolyn. Another question is a clear-cut win for prosecutors trying to put Maxwell behind bars, an expert said. On Wednesday afternoon, the twelve jurors deliberating Ghislaine Maxwell's fate gave everyone a surprise. No, they hadn't come to a decision yet. And no, they wouldn't reach one before Christmas. That the jurors needed more than two days to decide whether Maxwell would be found guilty or acquitted of six complicated counts wasn't necessarily unexpected. Maxwell, a child of the former British media baron Robert Maxwell, stands accused of trafficking girls to Jeffrey Epstein for sex, and sometimes participating in sexual abuse herself (she's denied the charges). Jurors in other trials have taken longer for less complicated allegations. But the prosecutors and defense attorneys had both previously expected the jurors to want to go home before the US District Court in Manhattan closed its doors on Thursday, ahead of Maxwell's birthday on Christmas Day. Alison Nathan, the judge overseeing the case, squeezed closing arguments and her charging conference into one marathon day on Monday, giving them a couple of hours to deliberate in the late afternoon before continuing on Tuesday and Wednesday. When she offered to keep the courthouse open for them Thursday, they responded with a note: ""No, thank you."" The jurors are scheduled to resume deliberations Monday. So far, they've sent just a handful of juror notes with questions. Three legal experts Insider interviewed cautioned that the information we have thus far is too limited to draw strong conclusions about what jurors may be thinking, except that they're taking the testimony from accusers seriously. But Lisa Bloom, an attorney representing eight Epstein accusers, said it may be a bad sign for prosecutors that the jurors still haven't come to a unanimous conclusion. ""There may be at least one juror who has a reasonable doubt. Over the weekend that could grow,"" Bloom told Insider. ""I've watched hundreds of juries and high-profile cases, and many in my own cases. And when they decide to break and take a long holiday weekend and come back, I think that's generally a good sign for the defense."" In their time deliberating, the jurors have sent a handful of notes, two of which have stood out. They requested an FBI interview of Carolyn, one of Maxwell's accusers, who testified using only her first name. And they asked whether the testimony of Annie Farmer, the last accuser in the trial, could count towards two of the conspiracy counts against Maxwell. The request for Carolyn's FBI interview, according to Jill Huntley Taylor, a professional psychologist and jury strategist with Taylor Trial Consulting, was a win for Maxwell. ""I think that probably did make the defense feel pretty good, because that's really where they were focused, on challenging the victims' testimony,"" Huntley Taylor told Insider. ""And Carolyn in particular because she didn't mention Maxwell to the FBI."" Carolyn has spoken to the FBI a number of times following what she said was years of sexual abuse at the hands of Epstein. In her trial testimony, she said that Maxwell sometimes scheduled sexualized ""massages"" with Epstein at his Palm Beach, Florida, home. According to notes from a 2007 FBI interview, Carolyn didn't name Maxwell as one of those people who scheduled massages, but just a woman with an ""accent."" Maxwell's defense attorneys have highlighted what they viewed as discrepancies in Carolyn's stories as a way to discredit her testimony. Bloom said the jury note means that the jurors are taking Maxwell's lawyers' arguments seriously. ""It means the jury is very carefully reviewing the evidence and at least one of them thinks that that cross-examination and those FBI statements were significant enough to request them,"" Bloom told Insider. Because the FBI interviews aren't recorded or transcribed, they can't be entered into evidence in a trial. The agents who sit in on those interviews just have notes, called a ""302"" document, but not a ""deposition"" transcript that jurors asked for. Nathan declined to give then the FBI notes, and instead directed them to the evidence and trial transcripts they already had — something Bloom said the jury may find frustrating. ""Juries definitely don't like it when things are kept from them,"" Bloom said. ""I don't know who they're going to hold this against. Would they hold it against the prosecution, or would they hold it against the defense that it didn't come into evidence? Of course, it's not the fault of either. It's the rules of evidence."" Moira Penza, a former federal prosecutor who led the case against NXIVM cult leader Keith Raniere, pointed out that the process of ""impeaching"" — or discrediting — a witness was harder than it looked. Even if Carolyn relayed different details about her story over time, that doesn't mean her story was necessarily inconsistent. She may have simply emphasized elements about Epstein earlier in time, because the FBI investigation and lawsuit she filed were centered on Epstein. ""You'll see that even very experienced trial lawyers, trying to say 'this person changed their story' is actually much harder than you would think,"" Penza said. ""Because often it isn't very clear cut."" The fact that the jurors asked for only the FBI 302 of Carolyn also bodes well for the rest of the case, Penza said. After all, Maxwell's attorneys grilled the other three accusers — Farmer, as well as ""Jane"" and ""Kate,"" who testified under pseudonyms — about their FBI interviews. And jurors didn't ask for notes about theirs. ""I don't think that we are seeing evidence so far through the note process that the jury is buying this defense,"" Penza said. ""That there was a whole conspiracy for all of these victims to manipulate their story to implicate Ghislaine Maxwell."" Later on Monday, jurors asked Nathan whether they could consider Farmer's testimony as ""conspiracy to crime in counts one and three,"" which would allow them to find Maxwell guilty of two of the conspiracy counts against her. Maxwell's lawyers appeared furious. Her attorney Christian Everdell asked Nathan to give a qualified answer about the limited of Farmer's testimony. Nathan ultimately sided with Assistant US Attorney Maurene Comey, giving a simple ""yes"" as an answer. Bloom said Nathan's ""clear as a bell"" answer was a victory for prosecutors. ""Anytime you can get the judge, who's the authority in the courtroom, to just give a definitive ""yes"" to a question — that's a definite win for the prosecution,"" she said. Penza said the question may reveal another element of how jurors were thinking — that they were closely focused on Maxwell's role in Epstein's sexual abuse operation. ""It's highly unlikely that the jurors will question there were minors engaging in commercial sex,"" Penza said. ""So the real question comes down to Maxwell's role in this. And where I think they would be focusing most is: What did Maxwell know?"" Aside from the specific requests about Carolyn and Annie, the jurors also asked for copies of transcripts for testimony from all four accusers in the trial. They also asked for transcripts of testimony from Juan Alessi, Epstein's former Palm Beach butler of 20 years who was one of the prosecution's star witnesses. If jurors are taking all of the accusers seriously, it may be harder for them to disentangle Maxwell from Epstein, according to Penza. ""At the end of the day, it's going to be difficult for the jurors to believe that all of these women were lying about Ghislaine Maxwell's role,"" Penza said. Maxwell's defense attorneys have argued that Epstein compartmentalized his life, and that Maxwell didn't know about his sexual proclivities. But Farmer's story is decidedly less complicated than that of the other accusers in the case. She testified in the trial that she spent a weekend at Epstein's New Mexico ranch when she was 16 years old, during which Maxwell gave her a sexualized massage and seemed to groom her for sex with Epstein. Farmer's more limited experience with Epstein and Maxwell — one weekend, rather than years of abuse that the three other accusers testified about in the trial — gives jurors a different way to examine Maxwell's role in Epstein's life. ""It looks like the jury is concentrating on what evidence is there that Maxwell knew what was happening when she wasn't in the room,"" Penza said. ""When she was grooming these girls and recruiting them."" With their question, Penza said, jurors appeared to be zeroing in on exactly what Maxwell knew about Epstein preying in teen girls. ""It's not that the prosecution has to prove that she saw what happened with her own eyes,"" she said. ""Even if she was just burying her head in the sand — it's the law. If you bury your head in the sand, then you are just as criminally culpable.""

12/24/2021,"MILAN (AP) — An archaeological dig in Sicily has uncovered traces of a lost World War II American heavy bomber shot down in 1943, and possible human remains that could lead to identification of five airmen whose bodies were never recovered. The six-week dig that ended this week was carried out by a team from the Pentagon’s Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, which locates and identifies missing U.S. military personnel around the world. The site near Sciacca was identified in 2017 by investigators using historical records and metal detectors. This year's dig uncovered wreckage “consistent only to a B-25 aircraft,’’ said archaeologist Clive Vella, the scientific director of the expedition, contributing to hopes that any confirmed remains would be linked to the missing crew. “We owe (their) families accurate answers,’’ Vella told the Associated Press Thursday. The North American B-25 Mitchell heavy bomber with a crew of six was one of 52 air losses with missing personnel in the area during WWII, mostly during 1943 as the Allies pushed into southeastern Sicily. It was shot down as it targeted a camouflaged German airstrip amid olive groves and pastureland on July 10, 1943. A German military report documented the crash of a U.S. aircraft about two kilometers (just over a mile) from the Sciacca airport, Vella said. One crew member was located immediately and buried in the town’s cemetery. The body was claimed in 1944 by U.S. military officials, but the other five airmen remained missing. In the intervening decades, the crash site “like most others in the Mediterranean region, was scavenged for metal, the land restored to its original use,’’ Vella said. “The scars of a crash were mostly gone.” The evidence, which includes possible human bones as well as potential remnants of the aircraft, has been transported to a laboratory in the U.S. for examination. Worldwide, there are more than 81,600 missing U.S. military personnel, including 72,350 from World War II, 7,550 from the Korean War and 1,584 from the Vietnam War. Over 41,000 of the total are presumed lost at sea.",World/Associated Press,"Possible relics of lost WWII US bomber, crew found in Italy",https://news.yahoo.com/possible-relics-lost-wwii-us-204920669.html
12/24/2021,"Calling him a “suspected serial killer,” authorities say a 25-year-old Miami real estate agent may be responsible for the killing of two homeless men and the shooting of a third. Miami police on Thursday announced that Willy Suarez Maceo, of Kendall, was charged with the shooting of a homeless man near downtown on Tuesday night. The man survived. About two hours later, Miami’s police chief said, Maceo is believed to have pulled up in a black Dodge Charger and from the car shot and killed another homeless man as as he slept on the sidewalk in Wynwood, sparking an exhaustive around-the-clock investigation. In that case, Maceo has yet to be charged with the killing of Jerome Antonio Price, 56, a shooting that was captured on surveillance video. Miami Interim Police Chief Manuel Morales, speaking a press conference on Tuesday night, said sharp-eye detectives immediately connected the two attacks. Officers soon found Maceo — and a firearm — in the car believed to have been used in the attacks. A rapid ballistics test linked his firearm to the two attacks, Morales said. “Homeless individuals for no reason have been brutally targeted,” Morales said. “They felt the pain and injustice suffered at the hands of a brutal individual.” Investigators believe Maceo also may have been behind a third attack — the murder of a homeless man on Oct. 16 at 27 SE 1 St. Surveillance footage of the suspected killer, shared previously with the public, shows a man who looks exactly like Maceo. The department did not release the name of the October victim. Morales appealed to the public — and fellow police departments — to come forward with info on possible more victims. “There may be other victims who suffered at the hands of this ruthless criminal,” Morales said. Miami police initially arrested Maceo Thursday about 1:30 a.m. on the 500 block of Northwest Sixth Avenue after a sergeant told him “to leave the property and refused to,” according to an arrest report. Records show Maceo, of Kendall, is a licensed real estate broker; Century 21 lists him as working in Miami, Kendall, South Miami and Palmetto Bay. According to his Facebook page, Maceo is from Cuba and attended Miami Sunset Senior High School. His Facebook page is a Miami potpourri of luxury cars, bikini models and photos of Maceo at a cryptocurrency conference in June. His Instagram page features homes for sale across South Florida, and him posing in front of a Porsche at the Cryptocurrency Fintech Convention in 2021 and in real estate videos. According to state records, Maceo had no previous arrests in Florida before this week. He also had a permit to carry a concealed weapon.",U.S./Miami Herald,Miami real estate agent in custody as cops announce arrest of ‘suspected serial killer.’,https://news.yahoo.com/miami-real-estate-agent-custody-202542594.html
