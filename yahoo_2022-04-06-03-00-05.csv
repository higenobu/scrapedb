4/6/2022,"A California city is planning to give universal basic income (UBI) to transgender and nonbinary residents regardless of their earnings level. Transgender residents in Palm Springs, California are eligible to receive a UBI of up to $900 per month solely for identifying as transgender or nonbinary — no strings attached. The new pilot program will have $200,000 set aside for allocation after a unanimous vote by the Palm Springs City Council last week. CAMILA ALVES MCCONAUGHEY REFLECTS ON RAISING HER FAMILY IN TEXAS: ‘IT REALLY EMBODIES OUR BELIEF SYSTEM’ Former San Diego City Councilman Carl DeMaio, a Republican who served as the first openly gay member of the city council, called the program ""outrageous and discriminatory."" ""We're completely opposed to guaranteed or universal basic income programs, because they ultimately cause inflation and raise the cost of living on everyone — they don't work,"" DeMaio said in a statement. ""But at least some of them have minimum income requirements to qualify, whereas this one is no-strings-attached 'woke' virtue signaling to the LGBT community in a way that is not only offensive but discriminatory,"" he continued. Twenty transgender and nonbinary Palm Springs residents will receive the free money funded by the taxpayers for 18 months, with advocacy-based health center DAP Health and LGBT advocacy group Queer Works managing the program. A six-month design period will be the precursor of the program’s implementation, in which the group Mayors for a Guaranteed Income will be involved providing guidance. DAP Health CEO David Brinkman claimed to reporters that the transgendered population is ""one of the most marginalized populations in our city who face some of the highest levels of housing insecurity, joblessness and discrimination."" Queer Works CEO Jacob Rostowsky also claimed in a press release that transgender and nonbinary people ""are highly marginalized in our society in general, especially economically,"" and told the Desert Sun that the city of Palm Springs would have to match any state funds. ""Our project's budget is estimated at about $1.8 million,"" Rostowsky said. ""And so when we look at what other [programs] that have been successfully funded have done, their local cities have provided nearly a match to that funding."" Palm Springs Mayor Lisa Middleton, who is transgender, pointed to the transcript from the city council's March 24 meeting where she ""expressed strong reservations in general to guaranteed income programs."" ""I specifically stated that I did not believe such programs could scale up to adequately respond to the over 37 million Americans living below the poverty line, the over 6 million Californians or the over 400,000 in the County of Riverside living below the poverty [line],"" Middleton said in an email, praising Brinkman for his work and expressing her ""concern for the financial vulnerability of the transgender community."" ""Transgender Americans suffer extremely high rates of under and unemployment. Transgender Americans face enormous challenges living full and authentic lives,"" the mayor said. ""Those challenges have increased substantially in the past few years as transgender children and their families have been targeted by extremist legislators and governors."" Middleton added she believes a UBI program is a ""county, state and federal responsibility,"" not a ""municipal"" one. ""My vote to affirm that evening was procedural to provide $200,000 to DAP in order to help them in the application for state funding. In advance of the vote I specifically stated my belief that guaranteed income programs were not the long-term way to proceed. I did not commit to any future funding of guaranteed income programs."" Other members of the Palm Springs city council did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment. Fox News' Jordan Early contributed to this report.

4/6/2022,"INDIANAPOLIS — For decades, the identity of an elusive figure, dubbed the “Days Inn” and “I-65” killer, evaded police as investigators tried to solve the slayings of three women in Indiana and Kentucky in the late 1980s. Tuesday, law enforcement officials said they’ve solved the case. Indiana State Police, alongside several federal and local agencies, said investigators have determined that Harry Edward Greenwell, who is now deceased, was responsible for the rapes and murders of Vicki Heath, Margaret “Peggy” Gill and Jeanne Gilbert. Investigators have also linked him through further DNA analysis to a sexual assault of a woman in 1990 in Columbus, Indiana. Greenwell died in 2013 at 68 years old. The young women worked as clerks in motels along the I-65 corridor. 'I-65 KILLER': What we know about the suspect and the victims Police on Tuesday said there's a ""distinct possibility"" Greenwell could be linked to a number of other unsolved murders, rapes, robberies and assaults. Sgt. Glen Fifield of the Indiana State Police said investigators were continuing to investigate whether he's connected to other violent crimes in the Midwest. The man’s identification bookends an investigation that’s spanned 35 years. The search for the killer began in 1987 when Heath was found assaulted and shot to death behind a Super 8 motel in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. In 1989, two more women fell victim to the killer. Gill, a 24-year-old overnight auditor at a Days Inn in Merrillville, was sexually assaulted and killed in the early morning hours of March 3. An eerily similar attack occurred at another Days Inn dozens of miles away on the same night. Gilbert, a part-time auditor for the Remington motel, was also attacked and assaulted. A motorist saw her body on the side of the road in White County. Police said both women were shot with the same .22 caliber handgun. Kentucky State Police in 2010 said DNA found at Heath’s killing linked to the deaths of Gill and Gilbert. The DNA also linked the same attacker behind a 1990 sexual assault of a clerk at a Days Inn in Columbus, Indiana. In that case, the clerk got away. Police on Tuesday said a DNA match to Greenwell was made through a close family member, returning a 99.99% probability, and credited the DNA analysis for the major breakthrough in the case. ""There are detectives in this room that have been involved in this for some form or another for literally generations. They're owed a debt of gratitude we can never possibly repay,"" said Indiana State Police Superintendent Doug Carter. ""I hope today might bring a little bit of solace to know that the animal who did this is no longer on this Earth."" The reveal of the Days Inn killer’s name also provided some closure to the victims’ families about the identity of the person who murdered their loved one. Kim Gilbert Wright, Gilbert's daughter, said the families may never know why their relatives suffered the horrific fate, but said some justice was served in finally revealing the killer's identity. ""I'd like to believe that whatever each of us defines as justice, or what each of us might define as closure, that we're all now able to share the healing process knowing the long known attacker has now been brought out of the dark, into the light,"" Wright, an attorney, said. The case of the I-65 killer began with Heath’s horrific killing. In February 1987, customers at the Super 8 Motel found no one at the front desk. The lobby was torn apart. The prospective patrons called the police to investigate the strange scene. Police made the grisly discovery near a trash bin at the back of the motel. Heath had been assaulted and shot twice in the head. The bloody crime rocked the town of Elizabethtown, Kentucky. Two years later, the killer carried out gruesomely similar attacks on the same night. Gill, a 24-year-old night auditor at the Days Inn in Merrillville, was attacked and killed in the wee hours of March 3, 1989. Roughly 50 miles south, Gilbert, a part-time auditor at the Days Inn in Remington, was found shot to death on the side of the road by a motorist driving through White County. Police determined they were killed by bullets from the same gun. Both motels had been robbed. In total, the killer swiped $426. Gilbert was a working mother in the throes of business courses at St. Joseph’s College, an Indianapolis Star article reported. Gill loved to bake, paint and cross stitch. She worked her way up from being a maid at the motel to an auditor position. Gill’s family displayed some of her cross-stitch pieces at her funeral, the article said, including one depicting the Last Supper, next to her coffin. The women's families told the Indianapolis Star months after the killing that they were still coping with the deaths – but not forgetting. Gill’s parents at the time said they don’t speak about revenge – just uncertainty. Her mother called the lack of a suspect at the time a “mixed blessing.” “In some ways, it’s peace not to have to look at someone. But you read about something else and you wonder ‘was that him, too?’” Anna Gill said.

4/6/2022,"By Krishna N. Das NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India on Tuesday condemned the killings of civilians in Ukraine's Bucha and called for an independent investigation, having earlier declined to explicitly criticise the invasion of Ukraine by its long-time partner Russia. A Ukrainian human rights ombudswoman said on Tuesday that between 150 and 300 bodies may be in a mass grave by a church in the town of Bucha, where Ukraine accuses Russian troops of killing civilians. Moscow denies targeting civilians in Ukraine, calling images of the dead in Bucha that have shocked the world a ""monstrous forgery"" staged by the West to discredit it. ""Recent reports of civilian killings in Bucha are deeply disturbing,"" T.S. Tirumurti, India's permanent representative to the United Nations, told a meeting of the Security Council. ""We unequivocally condemn these killings and support the call for an independent investigation."" Tirumurti delivered his speech shortly after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had a phone conversation with India's foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. The United States has repeatedly urged India to condemn Russia's aggression since the Feb. 24 invasion. India heavily relies on Russia for military hardware. New Delhi has repeatedly called for an end to violence in Ukraine, but has abstained from various U.N. resolutions on the war in a tricky attempt at balancing its ties with Moscow and the West. India, currently a non-permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, hosted the Russian foreign minister in New Delhi last week during which they discussed maintaining trade ties.

4/6/2022,"Padre Island National Seashore Nesting sea turtles aren't the only thing coming ashore on Padre Island. Mysterious rubber bales are also washing up on Texas beaches. Padre Island National Seashore recently took to Facebook to explain the surprising origin of the decaying objects that have been appearing on Gulf beaches since 2020. According to the national park, the bales were on a German ship sunk by the U.S. off Brazil's coast during World War II. ""Rubber bales like this one started washing up on Texas and Florida beaches in 2020, but before that, they were washing up on beaches in Brazil,"" Padre Island National Seashore wrote alongside a photo of one of the bales. The post goes on to explain that in January 1944, the SS Rio Grande, a German blockade runner, was carrying tin, copper, cobalt, and crude rubber bales when it was spotted by the USS Omaha and USS Jouett off the coast of Brazil. ""Realizing that they had been spotted, the crew of the Rio Grande abandoned the ship and its cargo after purposely trying to sink (ie scuttle) it,"" the park explained. ""The Omaha and Jouett fired on the Rio Grande until it sank, sending all its cargo to the ocean bottom where it was resting until recently."" WATCH: The Tiny Clear Blobs Washing up on Beaches Are Even Weirder Than You Think So, how did rubber bales weighing close to 200 pounds make their way from Brazil to Texas? ""As the SS Rio Grande started to break up, the waterlogged rubber bales floated up from the ocean bottom and into the North Brazil current,"" the park continued. ""From there, the bales stayed afloat in series of northbound currents along the coast of South and Central America, around the Yucatan and then finally into the Gulf of Mexico.""

4/6/2022,"(Reuters) - Moscow is studying what extra incentives it needs to offer highly skilled Russian expatriates to persuade them to return home, the Industry and Trade Ministry said on Monday. Russia has a reputation for producing world-class engineers and other technical specialists, but has for years been trying to counter an exodus of its brightest scientists. Moreover, Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine, which began on Feb. 24, has prompted thousands of Russians who oppose the conflict and want to avoid seeing their living standards slip under Western sanctions to leave the country. Alexander Sergeyev, president of the Russian Academy of Sciences, spoke last week of a large brain drain under Western sanctions - imposed in 2014 in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and significantly toughened since February. Russia has had a repatriation programme for skilled workers since 2007. ""The further development of this programme and additional benefits to attract highly qualified Russian specialists from different spheres is being discussed,"" the ministry said, without elaborating on what the benefits might be. The current programme includes compensation for the cost of moving, six months of unemployment benefits and other financial incentives, the ministry said. Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin newspaper, cited sources close to the government as saying that specialists were showing interest in returning to Russia because they faced pressure in Western countries over Moscow's intervention in Ukraine. Russia has sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in what it calls a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it calls dangerous nationalists. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw.
