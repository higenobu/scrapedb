12/30/2021,"Back in 2008, I lived in New York. I wasn’t a total stranger to North American winters – my stepmother is from Michigan, and the one and only time she persuaded me to go on a family sledging outing I was so cold I bailed and went back to sit in the car, like the moody teenager I most definitely was. But I’d never been on the continent for an entire winter. I bought a gigantic army surplus parka and resigned myself to months of wading through freezing slush, alternated with sitting in my studio apartment at night with the windows open because the ancient radiators had one setting: on. That was until I read an article in the New York Times travel section about upstate getaways. The mere mention of a charming B&B overlooking the Delaware River, where you could watch nesting eagles on a nearby bluff while sipping cognac, was all it took. Manhattan’s dreary ice-bound streets slipped away momentarily, and I imagined myself on that very deck. I was in a long-distance relationship at the time, and what, I reasoned, could be more romantic than such a weekend? It was February, the very worst part of winter, and any twinkle of New York City’s seasonal cheer had well and truly died. My boyfriend was due a visit, and I was ecstatic at the prospect of a trip out of the city. We would go somewhere a hundred times more romantic than my apartment (which housed the world’s smallest and most uncomfortable bed), a thousand times more interesting than the corner diner, and a million times more nurturing than the intersection of Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue. I could see it all: the icy river threading its way below the B&B’s deck, the eagles soaring majestically above us, me and my boyfriend holding hands and laughing in the snow, pink-cheeked and very much in love.  The B&B was remote. It was technically in a hamlet. Even better, I thought. The trip there involved taking a train from Penn station to the nearest town, then hiring a car to drive the rest of the way. No problem. I should have been alerted to potential trouble ahead when reports of snow and ice storms in the region started coming in. When I phoned the B&B to confirm we would still be coming, they seemed surprised and told us everyone else had cancelled. Being English, this didn’t occur to me. But as I now know, American weather is different. As the train headed north, it got quieter and quieter. Soon, we were the only passengers. It was absolutely freezing, and we were ill-equipped. We made it to the end of the line, picked up the cheapest hire car on offer, and proceeded to drive to our destination. Or rather tried to drive. With no snow tires on our crappy tin box, we slid all over the icy roads, some of which featured terrifying drops on either side. I genuinely thought we were going to die. I had a panic attack, crouched in the footwell of the passenger seat, which I tried to alleviate by chanting. I have no idea what, but probably something like: “Oh God, please don’t let us die out here.” My boyfriend was stoically silent as he attempted to navigate the unfamiliar terrain and not kill us both. At least that’s how I remember it. He may have told me to shut up and let him concentrate on driving, and he would have been perfectly in his rights to do so. Somehow, we made it the 18 terrifying miles to said charming, and yes, very remote, B&B, and we were indeed the only guests there. A captive audience, it turned out. The place was run by a gay couple, one of whom was sensibly still back in the city. The remaining proprietor took a keen interest in us, plying us with cocktails and nibbles. Relieved not to be in the death car any more, and emboldened by alcohol, I naively enquired how we could obtain dinner – thinking that given the magnitude of the weather disaster we were experiencing, we would generously be offered some sort of sustenance. “There’s a pizza place a few miles away. They don’t deliver,” he said. Upon realising we would have to get back on the road, I am unashamed to say I cried. And I can’t even drive. So we took a deep breath and went up to our room to freshen up, for we were starving and after a near-death experience pizza sounded just the ticket. Either the walls of the B&B were thin or the physics of sound travelling were affected by the absence of any other guests, but right there in our room, we could clearly hear the proprietor on the phone to his partner – and he was telling him everything about us. What I was doing in New York, what my boyfriend’s job was, how we had travelled to the B&B, how we had asked for dinner … If things weren’t uncomfortable enough before, they certainly were now. But we duly went to the pizza place, which was charming and wood-panelled, and we lost ourselves in food and wine. The next morning, we started afresh. It was romantic, even if we felt like hostages. There was crisp, blinding white snow all around, beautiful valleys and the Catskill mountains. We went to an outdoor store, got properly equipped with snow-boots and warm hats, and went for walks: crunching through snow, marvelling at the views and the fresh air. We made a short, Blair Witch-style film; we had a lot of sex. And we saw baby eagles through the telescope on the deck set up to view the nest – an amazing sight that I will always cherish. The kicker to all this romance came at cocktail hour on the second and last night, however. I had relaxed somewhat into our hostage situation, and my guard was down. If our host didn’t know literally everything about me from the first cocktail hour, he certainly did now. He sidled up to me as I was helping myself to some more spiced nuts. “Honey,” he said, “he is never going to marry you. Never.” I was too taken aback and too polite, young and English to say anything much at all. I tried to casually shake it off, but his words burned into me. I didn’t tell my boyfriend. Long-distance relationships are hard. We had been fighting a lot. But I loved my boyfriend with a fiery intensity, and was planning to go back to the UK and move in with him. He was seven years older than me, with a grownup job, a grownup house, and generally a life I hoped I could be part of. He represented stability, success – and yes, I did want to get married, although I don’t remember telling our host that, and certainly not in front of my boyfriend. I felt ashamed somehow – caught out, as if my desire for solidity, for togetherness, for marriage was emblazoned on my forehead. But of course he was right. Our relationship ended up an utter fireball of disaster. There were breakups, there were reunions, and eventually I left him.

In this one-off, he meets a couple who accidentally found a mammoth fossil in Swindon. Joined by archaeologists and palaeontologists, they excavate what turns out to be a mammoth graveyard in the prehistoric riverbed of the Thames. Cue a very exciting lesson on the relationship between early humans and mammoths during the ice ages.

Anthony Hopkins is repression personified as Stevens, the loyal-to-a-fault butler to James Fox’s Nazi sympathiser Lord Darlington. But when new housekeeper Kenton (Emma Thompson) arrives at the estate and shows an interest in him, there are hints of a thaw in his character.

The actor and singer is a figure in sad decline: underweight, hooked on prescription drugs, often drunk and missing her children back in LA, whom she can’t afford to take care of. But still, in Renée Zellweger’s outstanding portrayal, she can knock your socks off with a song and inspire adoration from her many fans. A tragedy about the uses and abuses of talent.

12/30/2021,"Westminster Abbey originally anticipated that Elton John would sing Your Song at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, rather than Goodbye England’s Rose, his reworking of Candle in the Wind, newly released records show. An early order-of-service draft included the lyrics of Your Song, although it was mistitled Our Song. A second draft, sent for approval to Buckingham Palace by the dean of Westminster Abbey, Dr Wesley Carr, substituted Candle in the Wind.  In the draft, Carr said “boldness”, the “unexpected” and “something of the modern world” should be included, and suggested “anything classical or choral (even if a popular classic such as something by [Andrew] Lloyd Webber) is inappropriate”. Better would be something by John, a favourite of Diana’s and “popular culture at its best”, the dean wrote, adding: “If it were thought the words too sentimental (although that is by no means a bad thing given the national mood) they need not be printed – only sung.” John has previously said he and his songwriting partner, Bernie Taupin, reworked Candle in the Wind at the suggestion of Richard Branson. It became the second biggest-selling physical single of all time, after Bing Crosby’s White Christmas, selling 33m copies. The circumstances of the death of Diana led to concerns within No 10 that Tony Blair might be bounced into publicly addressing the “sensitive” area of privacy and media intrusion by Jacques Chirac, the National Archive documents show. In a telephone call with Blair, Chirac, the then French president, proposed “tightening existing privacy law”, leading Downing Street officials to instruct the Foreign Office to warn them if it got wind that the French intended to make an announcement on the issue. Chirac told Blair that the deaths of Diana and Dodi Fayed, in a car crash after being chased by paparazzi “called into question the whole issue of media intrusion and he proposed to [Blair] that they look at toughening existing privacy laws”, according to a No 10 letter to the Foreign Office. The prime minister “agreed that public feeling would be running high, but (deliberately) made no commitment to look at the UK privacy laws” wrote Blair’s private secretary, Angus Lapsley. But if the French government made an announcement on those lines, “this would present us with a sensitive handling issue in relation to the UK government’s stance on media intrusion”, the letter continued. “The prime minister would therefore be grateful if you could endeavour to give us as much prior warning as possible of any sign that the French do indeed intend to make an announcement.” Downing Street’s view was that tighter legislation was not the answer and the biggest impact would come from a change of heart by the media itself, briefing documents released by the National Archive show. Downing Street was also relieved when Hillary Clinton, the then first lady, changed her mind about attacking the media at a press conference in London before the funeral. “Her personal inclination is to attack the press, but her staff are stopping her from doing it,” Jonathan Powell, Blair’s chief of staff, wrote to the press secretary Alastair Campbell, who scrawled “good” on the memo. As conspiracy theories over UK security and intelligence involvement in the deaths continued, the Labour MP Lindsay Hoyle, who had tried unsuccessfully to raise questions in the Commons on the subject, wrote to Blair asking him to make a public statement about the rumours. Hoyle, then the newly elected MP for Chorley, and now the Commons Speaker, was described as a “publicity-mad loony” in a Post-it note by a No 10 official, who said the Foreign Office’s strong advice was for Blair not to reply in writing. The Foreign Office feared Hoyle would relay any reply to the media and that a public statement “out of the blue” by Blair would give fresh wind to the conspiracy theories, another memo showed. Blair, who was advised by his private office to “put this in writing clearly and definitively”, wrote back to Hoyle in a personal letter stating: “Any suggestion that any British official organisation or department had anything to do with this tragic event is both ridiculous and deeply distressing for the bereaved families.” Before Diana’s funeral, the Conservative leader William Hague unsuccessfully urged Blair to delay the referendum on Scottish devolution as national mourning suspended campaigning. “This inevitably means that the referendum campaigns will effectively close down, and only three days will then remain for the Scottish campaign. This cannot, in any respects, be regarded as satisfactory,” Hague wrote.",News/UK news,Elton John’s Your Song originally slated for Diana funeral,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/30/elton-johns-your-song-originally-slated-for-diana-funeral
12/30/2021,"Knotty, arty, indebted to the post-rock of Slint, bedecked with sprechgesang vocals and unruly sax, Black Country New Road’s debut album, For the First Time, was acclaimed as one of 2021’s best: Chaos Space Marine, the first track to be released from its follow-up, suggests things continuing in a suitably abstruse vein. Released on 4 February  One of many artists belatedly touring a highlight album of 2021 – We’re All in This Alone Together was as well-received as Dave’s Mercury prize-winning 2019 debut, Psychodrama. There’s a convincing argument that he’s currently the best rapper in Britain: it’s hard to think of anyone else addressing serious issues so eloquently. Tour begins 15 February, Motorpoint Arena Nottingham Not an album, but an EP, containing two new songs – Hard Skool and Absurd, both leftovers from 2008’s preposterous Chinese Democracy – but the fact that it’s the first new GNR release to feature guitarist Slash and bassist Duff McKagan for more than 25 years gives it cachet. 25 February A belated victory lap, biggest-ever tour for UK rap’s biggest star – including three nights at London’s O2 Arena – that was meant to be in support of his 2019 album Heavy Is the Head but ended up being delayed twice as a result of Covid. Tour begins 13 March, Motorpoint Arena Cardiff The first album in eight years from the revered US folk-rock band – who apparently reconvened after keyboard player Jesse Chandler’s late father appeared to him in a dream and told him to “get the band back together”. Single Meanwhile… is an enticing taster: a lovely, softly psychedelic glide. 18 March Three years on from their award-winning second studio album I’m All Ears, the off-beam duo of Rosa Walton and Jenny Hollingworth return. The two tracks released thus far see them staying on the path that’s led from weird teenage curiosity status to a cheeringly idiosyncratic take on pop. 8 April Wet Leg were one of 2021’s big alt-rock breakthroughs: the deadpan Chaise Longue was one of the year’s best singles. But it also had a certain kind of novelty about it – the funny track at No 6 in John Peel’s Festive 50, for those old enough to remember such things. Their eponymous debut album should establish whether they’re in it for the long haul. 8 April The weird time-lag caused by Covid in full effect: here’s Dua Lipa finally touring the biggest pop album of 2020, Future Nostalgia, at the point where, ordinarily, you would be thinking about a follow-up. Still, the songs are fabulous pop-disco confections and given the strong visual identity she has developed, you’d imagine the staging will be something else. Tour begins 15 April, AO Arena Manchester The 2020 Mercury prize winner is one of Britain’s finest singer-songwriters: his loose, emotive, powerful hybrid of soul, psychedelia and funk is hugely impressive; his live performances, where the songs are allowed space to stretch out, are consistently fantastic. Tour begins 6 May, O2 Academy Glasgow Her third album, Solar Power, won a decidedly mixed response: for every critic enthralled by its homespun, understated quality, another found it underbaked and solipsistic. But she’s a reliably compelling and inventive live performer: it should be intriguing to see what she cooks up for this tour. Tour begins 25 May, O2 Academy Leeds Quite what form Abba’s virtual return to the stage will take remains a closely guarded secret. “Abbatars” are involved, as is a full live band, but not, as most people seemed to assume, holograms. It has to be something special to warrant the hype that has built up around the shows in recent months. Tour begins 27 May, Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London Another female artist whose eagerly awaited 2021 album saw her deliberately stepping back from the overheated climate of pop mania – the sonically muted Happier Than Ever largely depicted being a teenage superstar as a life of misery. Whether that mutes the chorus of teenage screams at these arena gigs remains to be seen. Tour begins 3 June, SSE Arena Belfast Ross’s most recent album, Thank You, was pretty awful, but – with all due respect – who goes to see Diana Ross in 2022 in the hope of hearing new material? Better to focus on the setlist from her 2020 US dates, which was as packed with Supremes and disco-era hits as anyone could wish. Tour begins 10 June, Cardiff Castle An impressive number of big-hitters at the summer’s biggest metal event, fully covering the hard rock waterfront: Kiss, Iron Maiden and Biffy Clyro headline; Deftones, Korn, Megadeth and Sepultura lurk a little further down the bill; should Dying Fetus, Venom Prison or Malevolence be more your thing they’re appearing, too. 10-12 June, Donnington Park, Derby Fender’s UK arena tour in spring is already sold out, evidence of a soaring popularity founded in the fact that there isn’t really anyone else like him at the moment: a young artist making stadium-ready guitar rock with a furious political bent. There is strong support at this 40,000-capacity gig from Fontaines DC and Beabadoobee, among others. 15 July, Finsbury Park, London Six events over two weekends, with a spectacular lineup: Gorillaz, Idles, Kraftwerk, the Chemical Brothers, Tame Impala, Nick Cave, the National, Dry Cleaning, Self Esteem, Greentea Peng, Floating Points, Perfume Genius and a host more, making it the ideal event for anyone who fancies an eclectic array of artists. 19, 20, 25-28 August, Victoria Park, London Only one artist is thus far confirmed for the 2022 End of the Road – Pixies – but the lineup is invariably well-curated and eclectic, lurking somewhere between leftfield alt-rock, folk dance music and, increasingly, jazz. The beautiful surroundings, complete with peacocks, make End of the Road one of the most loved of the larger boutique festivals. 1-4 Sepember, Larmer Tree Gardens, near Blandford, Dorset In 2022, the Cure will be 44 years old. With a mammoth back catalogue to wrangle, their gigs have become epics: when they last played live, in 2019, their average set featured 27 songs. They last put out a new album in 2008, but two – possibly their last – are apparently planned for release at some point. Tour begins 1 December, 3Arena Dublin Rosalía’s 2018 album El Mal Querer – a brilliant fusion of flamenco and experimental electronic music – catapulted the Spanish singer-songwriter to global stardom. Its follow-up is, in her own words, “brave”, “very different” and apparently influenced by the sound of reggaeton. Release date TBC That the band are headlining the Reading and Leeds festivals indicates a new album is incoming (they were spotted recording it in Suffolk over the summer). However, details are scarce about the follow-up to 2018’s Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino – a relative commercial disappointment compared with its immediate predecessor, the multi-platinum global smash AM. Release date TBC Seventy years after it was composed, Canadian American Robert Nathaniel Dett’s oratorio “from scripture and folklore” finally receives its first performance in Britain. Joshua Silverstein conducts the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and Chorus; Chrystal E Williams and Rodrick Dixon are the soloists. Symphony Hall, Birmingham, 23 February To mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of Ralph Vaughan Williams, the Hallé Orchestra and the BBC Philharmonic share a cycle of his nine symphonies. Ryan Wigglesworth, Mark Elder and Andrew Davis and John Wilson are the conductors, and the programmes include other VW works, including Job and Toward the Unknown Region. Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, 26 February – 12 May A history of the piano sonata in three recitals: the ever-imaginative Tamara Stefanovich presents a marathon guide to the evolution of the most significant of musical forms. Domenico Scarlatti and Soler provide the baroque starting points for her survey, which extends into the 20th century with works by Hindemith, Eisler and Ustvolskaya. Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, 27 February The centrepiece of violinist Pekka Kuusisto’s residency with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra is the UK premiere of Shrink, the concerto written for him in 2019 by Nico Muhly. It’s embedded in an all-American programme that also includes Missy Mazzoli’s Dissolve, O My Heart, Barber’s Adagio for Strings and Copland’s Appalachian Spring. Holy Trinity, St Andrews, 16 March; Queen’s Hall, Edinburgh, 17 March; City Halls, Glasgow, 18 March Deborah Warner follows her much admired 2019 Royal Opera production of Billy Budd with another Britten staging, which was first seen in Madrid last May. Allan Clayton takes the title role, with Maria Bengtsson as Ellen Orford and Bryn Terfel as Balstrode; Mark Elder conducts. Royal Opera House, London, 17-31 March Five days of new music with the London Philharmonic and Philharmonia orchestras, London Sinfonietta, Arditti Quartet and Bang On a Can All-Stars. Soloists include Nicolas Hodges, Meredith Monk, Mark Knoop and Clare Chase, while among the dozen premieres are works by Rebecca Saunders, George Lewis, Mason Bates, Tansy Davies, Betsy Jolas, Liza Lim and Alex Paxton. Southbank Centre, London, 30 March-3 April Andris Nelsons conducts both his orchestras in four concerts devoted to Richard Strauss. His Barbican appearances with the Leipzig Gewandhaus focus on the symphonic poems, while at the Royal Festival Hall the Boston Symphony programmes feature An Alpine Symphony and the Symphonia Domestica, prefaced by the Four Last Songs and extracts from the opera Salome respectively. Barbican, London EC2, 9 and 10 May, Royal Festival Hall, London, 12 and 13 May Glyndebourne’s summer season opens with the first professional production in Britain in more than half a century of Ethel Smyth’s best known opera. Directed by Melly Still and conducted by Robin Ticciati, it will be sung for the first time in French, the original language of the libretto, with a cast headed by Markus Brück and Clémentine Margaine. Glyndebourne Opera House, Lewes, 21 May-24 June Originally scheduled for last summer’s Aldeburgh festival, Tom Coult’s first opera finally reaches the stage, in Music Theatre Wales’s production, directed by Jude Christian. With a libretto by Alice Birch, it’s the story of a woman who seizes the chance to escape her humdrum life as time accelerates around her. Snape Maltings, Aldeburgh, 3 and 5 June, then touring Opera North follows its hugely successful concert staging of The Ring cycle with a similar treatment of Wagner’s final music drama. Richard Farnes conducts once again, with PJ Harris the director this time; Toby Spence is Parsifal, Brindley Sherratt Gurnemanz and Katarina Karnéus Kundry.

12/30/2021,"“The sci-fi murder mystery doctor dramedy Earth needs now!” That was the US marketing blurb for Resident Alien, a plucky attempt to turn the show’s audacious genre-mashing into a marketing angle. While it certainly has a lot going on – an alien crash-lands in small-town Colorado and attempts to evade detection by hijacking the identity of a big-city doctor – it only took a few episodes for me to realise why I was enjoying it so much. This story of a fusspot out-of-towner clashing with the rhythms of a town full of curious eccentrics is a spiritual descendant of 1990s fish-out-of-water touchstone Northern Exposure, complete with snowy setting and covetable local bar.  But what makes it truly special is Alan Tudyk’s performance as the literal-minded, self-regarding ET who finds himself beginning to empathise with humans while still plotting to annihilate us all. It’s a winning combination of black humour and doofus slapstick. Graeme Virtue By rights, Breeders should not be a hidden gem: it stars Daisy Haggard and Martin Freeman, two of our finest comic actors, and was co-created by the latter alongside Chris Addison and Simon Blackwell, best known for The Thick Of It. In terms of viewing figures, however, it qualifies. That’s partly because it airs on Sky One, a channel that provides its programme-makers creative freedom, but very few viewers to actually witness it. Yet it’s also due to the highly discomfiting nature of the show itself: this is a comedy about parenting whose chaos is in no way cosy. Following the domestic travails of Ally and Paul, Breeders unflinchingly catalogues how well-meaning mothers and fathers can fail their children: series one involves many trips to A&E, a social services visit and Ally mistakenly believing Paul has murdered their insomniac children. In series two, which aired this year, the action revolves around Paul’s anger issues and the breakdown of his relationship with his son. None of these things are laughing matters. Except, in this cathartic, troubling and gratifyingly complex show, they somehow are. Rachel Aroesti Possibly the most under-appreciated mainstay of Channel 4’s primetime scheduling, The Dog House’s second season inexplicably flew below the radar in 2021. And yet, it was an unalloyed televisual joy whose matching process between wannabe dog adopters and adorable pooches was like First Dates for pet owners. Think surprisingly emotional interviews from people longing for the companionship of a dog – tempered with waggy tails and often tearfully grateful humans. It was an uplifting joyful romp of a show, with redemption at its heart. Alexi Duggins When Ken Smith was 26, he was brutally beaten up during a night out and spent 23 days unconscious. Doctors told him he would never speak or walk again. But he did. In fact, he walked and walked until he finally arrived somewhere he felt comfortable. Now, Smith is 74 and has been living alone in a self-constructed cabin in the Scottish Highlands for almost 40 years. Lizzie McKenzie’s beautiful, redemptive documentary finds Smith contemplating the possible end of both his lifestyle and his life itself – intimations of his mortality are becoming more frequent and the wisdom of him remaining in his cabin is debatable. And yet somehow, this film never feels sad or regretful – it’s simply the story of a man who made a very unusual choice and seems entirely at peace with it. And seeing him, still lost in wonder, still awed by the dazzling nature that surrounds him, you understand why. Phil Harrison The Friends reunion, The OC’s arrival on All 4 and a Sex and the City reboot: the pandemic has proved that nostalgic noughties television is hugely popular. And any millennial who grew up watching work-phobic heiress Paris Hilton trying her perfectly manicured hand at grafting on The Simple Life knows no one embodies those simpler times more than her. So when she returned with a “cooking” series in the summer, it served as a sort of therapy for those of us looking for a bit of familiar comfort while trapped indoors. It is inexplicably pleasing to see this bizarre being – with her endless resources, state-of-the-art kitchen and team of staff – struggle to serve up unapologetically on-brand and disgusting looking creations such as Frosted Flakes french toast and Unicorn-oli Cannoli to guests including Kim West and Demi Lovato. We also see a different, sweet side to Hilton – one which actually reminds us she is a human, not a caricature – as she talks about wanting to start a family. For the most part, though, Hilton really is on another planet, and it was a pleasure to escape this plagued one to join her there for a few glittery hours. Hollie Richardson You have to remember that 5 January 2021 was an unbelievably dark day. We were one day off our third national lockdown. Everything felt heavy and apocalyptic. But then what should Netflix throw up? Why, a series entitled History of Swear Words, where a range of comedians and historians explored the usage of the words fuck, shit, bitch, dick, pussy and damn. Better still, it was presented by none other than Nicolas Cage, his hairline tugged all the way down his forehead like a hood, apparently for the sole reason that there is nothing as entertaining on Earth as Nicolas Cage screaming swear words at the top of his lungs. Had History of Swear Words been shown at any other time in human history, it would have been automatic filler. On 5 January 2021, though? My god, it was just what we needed. Stuart Heritage Hip Hop: The Songs That Shook America took one song an episode, avoiding tracks already widely acknowledged as classics, and did a deep dive into its provenance, cultural history and the aftershocks it left in its wake. It looked at Kanye West’s Jesus Walks and Kendrick Lamar’s Alright, but the two best episodes came later in the run: one that studied Outkast’s Elevators, which took us back in time to see high school-era Big Boi and Andre 3000; and one on The Bridge by Marley Marl and MC Shan, which played out like an in-depth alternative history of American rap. It occasionally massaged the story into the shape it wished to present, but for the most part, you came away feeling as if it was very good value indeed. It was chatty, informative, each story was ushered along briskly, and it made a refreshing change from the usual folk/prog BBC Four music docs. Rebecca Nicholson What’s scarier than a friend announcing they’re starting a podcast? Only Murders in the Building took this very 2021 concept and spun it into murder mystery gold. Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez starred as true crime podcast obsessives who start their own show after a neighbour’s death. The case was intriguing enough but it was the trio’s chemistry that captivated, making good use of their generation gap (see Steve Martin’s inability to write a casual text) with Gomez, famous from her smiley Disney Channel days, playing their straight-faced foil. Throw in some star cameos – like Tina Fey’s imperious true crime podcaster and Sting, playing to insufferable pop star type – and there wasn’t a more delightful show about homicide this year. Not least due to its frequent, playful ridiculing of true crime tropes, plus a cleverly scripted episode whose minimal dialogue movingly delved into the perspective of a deaf character. Things ended with a cliffhanger – what else? – for a second season.

12/30/2021,"I’ve stopped arguing with my mum this year. I’ve been trying to get her to see my side for more than two decades. Almost every conversation we used to have would end with my insides twisted up like a pretzel. We would argue about everything, from religion to patriarchy and family. No conversation was safe. I’ve never had cause to doubt my mother’s love. Maybe that’s why it got so bad, and why Mum bore the brunt of my frustrations; I knew she wasn’t going to leave me. But now in her 70s, weak from having battled cancer, and left with hearing loss, I’m acutely aware that we’re running out of time. We’ve been standing at the opposite sides of a bridge, our arms outstretched, not knowing how to get to each other for too long.  Growing up, I trusted my parents. But the way I saw the world changed after my second arranged marriage ended in divorce. I felt betrayed by the choices they had made for me, especially my mum. I began to see injustices around me that I’d never noticed before. Small things, such as the men eating first at dinner parties, boys in the living room, girls in the kitchen. The men never offering to help. The advantages taken by extended family, and how these were only ever one-way. I began calling things out. While Dad seemed to understand, this wasn’t received well by Mum. She and I are both Muslim, but I found myself having different interpretations of what that meant. We look at texts, scripture, and theological stories through the lens of the culture we are raised in. My mum grew up in Pakistan and in Iran. I was born and raised in England. Urdu is her first language, English is mine. As we navigated the knotty problems of life, a lot of our adult relationship became lost in translation. We would argue about women’s rights, about how men should be treated – and I felt she wanted me to accept the status quo too often. Mum believed the demise of my marriage was due to bad luck, I saw it as the symptom of something far bigger. One day, halfway through a family visit, my eight-year-old son, exhausted with our arguments, said to me: “Mama, don’t argue with Nani.” I looked into his eyes. He was pleading with me. I had to find a way to stop. So I did. At the age of 47, I finally scratched the CD that Mum and I had been playing on a loop for years. I began ending conversations early to prevent rows, I stopped filling silences, and I didn’t ask questions that I knew I wouldn’t like the answer to. As the dynamic between us shifted, so did my understanding of the woman who is my mother. I did the painful work of looking at myself, and I began to see my mother as a person separate to me. Mum came to England from Karachi in 1973 when she was 23 years old. At the time, homes in Bradford still had outside toilets; in Karachi, my mum had lived in a sprawling house with several washrooms, and staff to clean them. She had arrived in a country where racism was rife, with a first-class degree that was not accepted here. I see now how frightening that must have been for her – and how much time must have been spent simply trying to survive here. She did not have energy to be angry like me. This year, I have come to understand that my rage was not for her, but grief for the people and experiences that I feel I have lost, for having had to fight alone, for having had to fight at all. But my mum had also had her battles, and she’d done her best. We love each other, and love requires acceptance. We’re not fully there yet. I’m still raw, and I get the sense my mum is still nervous, but we are edging towards each other, and hopefully our hands will meet in the centre of that bridge.

12/30/2021,"The extent of New Labour infighting and of Tony Blair’s struggle with allegations of sleaze has been underscored by Cabinet Office papers that show No 10 aides privately thought Gordon Brown could have breached the ministerial code. Files released to the National Archives show that in 1998 Blair’s chief spin doctor, Alastair Campbell, urged him to privately rebuke Clare Short, then international development secretary, after she publicly denounced cabinet colleagues as “vultures”.  And Blair’s chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, warned him in the same year that he needed to get to grips with what he saw as a lack of discipline among government ministers, expressing concern about ministerial probity. So grave was the problem thought to be that No 10 considered creating a “commissioner for ministerial ethics” to shore up public trust. Powell even went so far as to suggest in writing to Blair that there was reason to suspect that his closest political friend and, ultimately, greatest political rival, Gordon Brown, was breaching strict rules on ministerial standards, an offence for which a cabinet member would usually be expected to resign. “At some stage we will have to deal with the ways in which some ministers are dealing with their political work. How, for example, is Gordon paying for his newsletter to all party members and his receptions (almost certainly in breach of the ministerial code). He is not the only one,” Powell wrote to Blair on 20 February 1998. In another note, written to the prime minister about a month earlier addressing possible ways to deal with parliamentary questions on ministerial propriety, Powell suggested sending an “edict to tell ministers to be more careful”. The note read: “I think Gordon is probably right when he says people are being too lax. Did [then foreign minister] Derek Fatchett really need to take his wife to Australia etc. Do you want to pursue this (with the implied admission that all has not been handled well)?” A handwritten note from Blair in the margin reads: “Let me speak to cabinet and get them to do it by word of mouth.” It gives an indication of the time and effort that was going into trying to hold together cabinet discipline in the early years of his premiership. Three days prior, for example, one of Blair’s closest advisers, Anji Hunter, felt moved to email Powell passing on concerns expressed by an unknown colleague that the prime minister was looking only at the big picture and that No 10 should not “take our eyes off the sleaze factor”, which was thought to be eroding the Blair government’s moral authority. In another handwritten note, Blair’s policy adviser Liz Lloyd replied: “I, too, am worried about this.” She suggested pushing a story that Blair was privately admonishing ministers over standards. Blair was also urged to privately deal with specific ministers, including Short, who Campbell warned was likely to embarrass the government. A documentary showed her accusing a ministerial colleague of telling a journalist she had likened Ulster Unionists to the Ku Klux Klan during a cabinet meeting. Denying the claim, Short told the film-makers: “It’s just utterly malicious, it’s someone from within the cabinet because it’s a lie about a discussion that did take place. It’s very sad. It’s extraordinary that people on your own side would do such things.” Briefing the prime minister on the affair shortly afterwards, Campbell wrote: “As you may have seen, I sought to kill the latest Clare story by being supportive. The trouble is that she will believe it. Her office have already been on saying how grateful they are. In other words, she’ll do something again before long. “Can I suggest you write to her on these lines: for public consumption, we have been supportive over the remarks made on the documentary by you. However, I have to tell you that I regard such comments as unhelpful and self-indulgent. I understand that your department was advised not to cooperate with such a project, given the way that these film-makers generate publicity. And as there is no evidence whatever that a member of the cabinet briefed against you, other than surmise, it was ill-advised to say so.” The confidential papers were released to the National Archives as part of the plan to release government records when they are 20 years old. The Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown wanted to redesign the House of Commons in a “hemisphere” shape as a symbol of his party and New Labour’s joint reform agenda, according to newly released official papers. Ashdown was keen to expand cooperation between the two parties – nicknamed “the project” – after Tony Blair’s 1997 election victory. In a letter to Blair, he proposed that the Commons chamber could be reshaped as a hemisphere in recognition of the new culture of “consultation, pluralism [and] debate” that they hoped to inaugurate. He wrote: “As a symbol of this we might even say we shall alter the shape of parliament itself, turning it into a hemisphere and setting up a design competition to do this before the millennium.” The proposal met with little enthusiasm in No 10. In a memo to the prime minister, Jonathan Powell, Blair’s chief of staff, wrote: “I can’t believe that he has proposed a hemispherical House of Commons. Are you sure you want to go ahead with this project?” Tony Blair was worried about the lack of “wow” factor in early plans for the Millennium Dome, a project he inherited from John Major’s Conservative government and decided to go ahead with despite the opposition of many of his cabinet colleagues. Newly released National Archive documents show that Charlie Falconer, who inherited responsibility for the Dome after Peter Mandelson’s resignation over a personal loan controversy, frequently lamented the lack of “wows”. “We need at least 10 wows” but the zones were “too samey and too worthy”, Falconer wrote in one memo to Blair. Blair annotated the note: “This is v worrying.” The Dome was a controversial scheme, but Falconer wrote to Blair: “We have a dome and we must all work to make it a success.” Mandelson, after his resignation, wanted to retain some kind of continuing role in the Millennium Experience, and Blair had in mind a sort of “PPS [parliamentary private secretary] role for Peter on the Dome”, the documents show. Claire Pillman, of the Millennium Unit at the culture department, said Mandelson could not be appointed as a special adviser on the Dome as it would be seen as a return to “shady figure behind the throne”, and Lord Falconer risked being portrayed as a “convenient puppet”.",News/UK news,New Labour infighting and sleaze concerns laid bare in archive papers,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/30/new-labour-infighting-and-sleaze-concerns-laid-bare-in-archive-papers
12/30/2021,"A Manhattan jury’s decision to find Ghislaine Maxwell guilty of sex trafficking has left victims of the former British socialite and her ex-boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein “relieved and grateful”. Maxwell was found guilty on five of six charges for her involvement in Epstein’s sexual abuse of teenage girls. Prosecutors said that Maxwell “preyed on vulnerable young girls, manipulated them and served them up to be sexually abused”.  “I am so relieved and grateful that the jury recognized the pattern of predatory behavior that Maxwell engaged in for years and found her guilty,” said Annie Farmer, one of the victims who testified at the trial. “She has caused hurt to many more women than the few of us who had the chance to testify in the courtroom. I hope that this verdict brings solace to all who need it and demonstrates that no one is above the law.” Farmer, one of four accusers in this case and the only one to testify under her full name, told the court that Maxwell gave her a nude massage at Epstein’s New Mexico ranch when she was just 16. She met Epstein through her sister Maria, who worked for him as a fine arts painter. “ANNIE AND I ARE SOBBING WITH JOY!!!,” Maria Farmer said on Twitter after the verdict was announced. Virginia Giuffre, another Epstein victim who has accused Maxwell of being involved in her abuse, said she would “remember this day always”. “My soul yearned for justice for years and today the jury gave me just that,” Giuffre said on Twitter. “I hope that today is not the end but rather another step in justice being served. Maxwell did not act alone. Others must be held accountable. I have faith that they will be.” Giuffre is suing Prince Andrew in a civil lawsuit, claiming he had sex with her on three occasions two decades ago when, aged 17, she had been sexually trafficked by Epstein, allegations Andrew vehemently denies. Teresa Helm, another of Maxwell’s accusers, told the BBC Maxwell would “never again have the opportunity to take anything from anyone”. She said: “Justice takes the lead today. I am consumed with gratitude for every brave, courageous and justice-driven person that has fought for this outcome. “Ghislaine Maxwell will never again have the opportunity to take anything from anyone. She will reside on the other side of freedom. Us survivors, we go free.” Damien Williams, the US attorney for the southern district of New York, hailed the verdict against Maxwell for “one of the worst crimes imaginable, facilitating and participating in the sexual abuse of children”. “The road to justice has been far too long, but today justice has been done. I want to commend the bravery of the girls, now grown women, who stepped out of the shadows and into the courtroom,” Williams said. Dave Aronberg, the state attorney in Palm Beach county, Florida, where Epstein had a mansion at which he abused teenage girls, told CNN that Maxwell “just got what was coming to her”. Sigrid McCawley, who represents several victims, said that with the verdict Maxwell has been held accountable and justice served. “Today’s verdict is a towering victory, not just for the brave women who testified in this trial, but for the women around the world whose young and tender lives were diminished and damaged by the abhorrent actions of Ghislaine Maxwell,” McCawley said. Maxwell did not speak or look at the jury as the verdict was read, the journalist Julie Brown, who spent years working to expose Epstein’s crimes, said on Twitter. “As the verdict was read Maxwell struggled to stand, but said nothing,” Brown tweeted. “Maxwell, 60, appeared shaken, she sipped a cup of water then slumped back in her chair. She did not shed a tear.” Maxwell faces up to 65 years in prison. Late Wednesday, Maxwell’s brother, Kevin Maxwell, said the family stood by her and believed she would be vindicated on during the appeals process. “We firmly believe in our sister’s innocence,” he said in a statement. Bobbi Sternheim, Maxwell’s lead defense lawyer, said her team planned to appeal the verdict.

12/30/2021,"British Steel sank to a loss of £140m last year, according to accounts that showed financial difficulties even after it was taken over by a new Chinese owner. The UK company was saved from liquidation in 2019 when Jingye stepped in to buy it – for only £24m – after months of subsidised operations as the government pushed to find a buyer for an important industrial employer. Its previous owner, the private equity firm Greybull Capital, exited after only three years in charge.  British Steel employs about 3,000 people at a steelworks in Scunthorpe, north Lincolnshire, in one of the “red wall” constituencies that were a critical part of the Conservative party’s 2019 general election victory, with Holly Mumby-Croft deposing the Labour MP Nic Dakin. The company lost £69 a tonne on 2.6m tonnes of steel produced during 2020, Jingye’s first year in charge, according to accounts filed at Companies House, underlining the dire state of the UK steel industry. It made revenues of £844m during the year. The accounts showed a profit overall for the year of £295m, although that was only achieved through a £410m paper profit resulting from the £24m knockdown price for assets that were valued at £434m. Jingye, whose sprawling operations are otherwise mainly based in China, also lent its new British subsidiary £220m to use as cash to run day-to-day operations. The drop in demand from automotive customers was a key factor in the £140m operating loss for 2020, as car factories were shut temporarily at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. In the past year steel prices have soared as demand for infrastructure investments rose during the rapid economic recovery and supply failed to keep up after a few difficult years. Yet British Steel has warned of difficulties in taking advantage of the boom. In September it said that surging energy prices meant it was impossible to make steel profitably at busy points in the day when energy demand was highest. It quoted a 50-fold increase in energy prices at some points in the day in September compared with April. Energy costs account for as much as a fifth of the total manufacturing cost, according to UK Steel, a lobby group that argued earlier this month that high energy prices made the UK industry uncompetitive against rivals in the EU and beyond. Jingye has promised to invest heavily in British Steel to improve its energy efficiency in a bid to cut costs as well as carbon emissions. On buying the company Jingye pledged to invest £1.2bn overall in upgrading British Steel’s assets. The accounts revealed only £38m of capital expenditure in 2020 as the pandemic delayed major projects, but they also highlighted plans for £123m of investment planned during this year. British Steel is owned by a holding company, Jingye Steel (UK) Holding Limited, although the parent company is months late in filing its first accounts at Companies House, a legal requirement.

12/30/2021,"When Covid first hit, Jack Battersby, residential sales manager at Taunton’s Wilkie May & Tuckwood estate agents, set up in his spare room and fretted that lean times were ahead. “It didn’t turn out like that. Business has been great,” said Batttersby as his desk phone rang constantly and messages pinged on his mobile. “We’re getting customers from all over – people from London and the south-east who since Covid are working from home so they might as well be here, but also people moving from places like Bristol and Exeter because they get more for their money.”  Battersby was not surprised to see Somerset’s county town topping the Halifax’s UK house price growth table, with a 21.8% increase to £315,759. “There’s brilliant countryside all around but we’re also well connected.” Taunton is surrounded by high ground – Exmoor, the Quantock Hills, the Blackdown Hills – and the surfing beaches of north Devon and Cornwall are easy to reach. But the town is also just an hour’s drive from Bristol and by rail London Paddington is less than two hours away. Hannah Thomas, a negotiator at another estate agency, Greenslade Taylor Hunt, said properties were snapped up within days. “It’s been a mad year in a good way,” she said. Thomas said families were keen to move into neighbourhoods on the edge of town in good catchment areas such as Trull, where an end-of-terrace Victorian cottage is on the market for £350,000. “We’re also getting larger families moving in, for example three generations living together in a larger house. People seem to be looking for different ways of living.” Another reason for the property boom, according to Thomas, is the new nuclear power station Hinkley Point C, which is being built on the Somerset coast 17 miles north of Taunton. Some employees who will be there for a while are buying homes, while investors are hunting houses to rent out rooms to temporary workers. Taunton is also attracting retirees. Quantock House, for example, has apartments for the over-55s who can enjoy an in-house bistro, treatment rooms and balconies with views to the hills. Hundreds more homes are being built as developers try to meet the demand. But this is causing disruption, puncturing the quiet that incomers crave. “The constant building and shutting down roads for the construction traffic is a pain,” said Nicky Heal, who owns Nicky’s Flower Studio. Chris Birch, who runs the upmarket ready meals shop, Cook, said he had moved from Surrey for the quiet life but warned Taunton was not perfect, reeling off the shops that have shut recently, including a large Debenhams department store. There has not yet been a boom in businesses such as trendy coffee bars that incoming Londoners might like. “Who would invest at the moment?” said Birch. And anyone hoping for a cutting edge arts scene might find Taunton wanting. The town has a theatre and arts complex, Taunton Brewhouse, but few would claim hipness for the town. The tourist information centre flags up its flower show (est 1831) before its nightlife. Taunton has no top flight football or rugby club, though the town’s skyline is dominated by the floodlights of the country cricket ground. There are also losers from the booming property market. Charities who work with the homeless have reported a very busy Christmas getting emergency supplies out to the most vulnerable and the rising property prices are making it harder for younger people and those in poorer-paid employment to get on the property ladder. Concerns are growing that local people could be pushed out by the rising prices – as they have been in places like Bristol and further west like St Mawes in Cornwall. Gross weekly pay in Somerset is £567 compared with £577 in the south-west as a whole and £613 in Great Britain. Figures released by the government in the summer revealed that more than 20,000 families in the south-west were made homeless or threatened with losing their homes during the first phase of the pandemic. Somerset West and Taunton council acknowledges that lack of affordable housing is an issue in the area and is aiming to build 1,000 new council homes in the next 30 years . It has also drawn up a plan to end rough sleeping by 2027 and has taken steps to try to tackle the problem such as leasing out affordable accommodation to medical students at a new development called Coal Orchard in the town. Property hunting in Taunton on Wednesday were the Procter family from Berkshire. Dad Peter said he, his wife and two young children were looking for a change of scene. “It feels too busy where we live,” said Procter. “I could work from home and could get into the office in London once or twice a week if we lived here. It will be a bit of extra effort for me but it will mean we all have much fresher air, a slower way of life, which I think most people need just now.”",Lifestyle/Money,‘People seem to be looking for another way of living’: how Taunton became property hotspot ,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/30/people-seem-to-be-looking-for-another-way-of-living-how-taunton-became-property-hotspot
12/30/2021,"Iwake to a grey haze that my brain insists is daylight – but when I check my phone it’s only 3am. I lie on, listening to a robin singing – another diurnal creature whose circadian cycle is upset by the new white LED (light emitting diode) streetlight outside my house. At 4am, I give up on sleep. Outside, other than my own footsteps, the only sound is more robin song as I go walking. In winter, robins are one of the few avian species still singing, their ranks swollen by territorial females as well as males. Their winter song is languid and tremulous. However, approaching the glare of an LED lantern, I notice an uptick in my pace that seems to chime with a greater stridency coming from the singing robin in an adjacent sycamore.  The impact of light pollution on songbirds has long been recognised, tricking the bird’s brain into thinking night is day. This is easier to hear when the dawn chorus has been winnowed to a single species – and it is no coincidence that the robin is that species. With their large eyes adapted for crepuscular activity, robins are especially sensitive to light and already one of the earliest avian risers. But it’s not just any light that awakens them. Diurnal birds have circadian photosensitive cells in their retina (as do we mammals), which respond to the blue wavelengths in sunlight. The traditional sodium-vapour streetlight emits light at the more red end of the visible light spectrum, and is of little disturbance to the dozing robin. Those streetlights are being gradually replaced by more energy-efficient LED ones. But in solving one problem, another has been created: these white LED lights are rich in those blue wavelengths that disturb not just songbirds but moths and bats too. It’s no wonder these robins can’t sleep. I leave the streetlights behind. I’ve reached the nocturnal cloak of Lagan Valley regional park. Stars prick into view. I tread cautiously through the mulchy dark. As shades grow into a gauze of scrub and trees, there’s not a robin to be heard.
