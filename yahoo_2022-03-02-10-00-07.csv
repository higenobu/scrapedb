3/2/2022,"Kim Jung-ju, the founder of Nexon, South Korea’s largest gaming company, died on Feb. 28 in Hawaii at 54 years old.

NXC, Nexon’s holding company, announced Kim’s death and stated that he had been undergoing treatment for depression as his physical symptoms worsened, according to The Korea Herald.

He is survived by his two teenage daughters, Kim Jung-min and Kim Jung-youn, and wife, Yoo Jung-hyun.

Nexon CEO Owen Mahoney released a statement that read:, “It is difficult to express the tragedy of losing our friend and mentor Jay Kim, a man who had an immeasurably positive impact on the world. As a founder and visionary leader, Jay encouraged those around him to ignore the skeptics and trust their creative instincts. He will be deeply missed by his Nexon family and many friends.”

Kim launched Nexon in 1994, and it became the first Korean gaming company to earn over $830 million in annual sales within the first year of its debut. Nexon also developed one of the first multiplayer online role-playing games, “The Kingdom of the Winds,” in 1996 and launched one of the world’s most famous games, “MapleStory,” in 2003.

According to Seoulz, Nexon is now the biggest gaming company in South Korea with a market capitalization of $27 billion.

In 2007, the 54-year-old made his debut on Forbes’ Korea’s Richest List where he ranked No. 28 with a net worth of $590 million. In June 2021, Kim officially became the third richest man in South Korea with a total net worth of $10.9 billion, reported Forbes.

After pleading not guilty to bribery charges in 2016 when Kim was indicted of lending money to a close prosecutor friend, he focused on various philanthropic work. According to Forbes, in 2017, Kim founded the venture philanthropy fund C Program, and in 2018, he vowed to donate $93 million to children’s hospitals and startup companies. He also stated that his children would not be inheriting his fortune.

Between 2013 and 2015, his company donated approximately $16.6 million to help build the Purme Foundation Nexon Children's Rehabilitation Hospital in Seoul,. Nexon claimed the hospital was the first rehabilitation hospital to be built for children in South Korea.

Prior to his death, Kim continued donating to children’s hospitals in South Korea and had donated a total of $3.1 million to the Daejeon Chung-nam Public Children’s Rehabilitation Hospital as well as $2 million to the Nexon Children’s Palliative Care Center at Seoul National University Hospital, which is planned to open sometime this year.

3/2/2022,"A Chinese news anchor has quickly drawn attention for the colors of her recent on-air attire, which closely resembled those of the Ukrainian flag.

According to Taiwan News, the anchorwoman for Chinese state-run CCTV4 was reporting that NATO was to blame for Russia's invasion of Ukraine at the time she wore the outfit.

Reddit user u/Semetali uploaded a screenshot of the news anchor wearing a bright yellow button-up blouse with a bright blue blazer, colors similar to those in the Ukrainian flag.

 Many users responded to the post, speculating whether the anchor’s outfit had been worn deliberately to support Ukraine or if the color coordination was just a coincidence. While some contended that the anchor was taking “a stand” or pointed out that the outfit stood out from the usual “neutral colors” worn by Chinese anchors, others believed that it was nothing more than a fashion choice.

“Interesting thing about blue and yellow is that they are complimentary [sic] colors, which means they are colors that make each other pop and look better, which is why you commonly see them paired in outfits, paintings, graphic design and pretty much everywhere,” one user argued. “Maybe she supports Ukraine. Maybe she’s just good at color coordinating outfits.”

Users also argued that the blazer’s color hues differed between the screenshot and the video where the screenshot appears to show a brighter blue while the video shows a more teal-toned blue.

CCTV4 features a mix of English and Chinese language programming and is a part of state-owned China Central Television, or CCTV.

China has not condemned Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and has instead accused the U.S. of causing the conflict. Last week, Horizon News, which operates under Chinese state-owned outlet Beijing News, accidentally leaked editorial instructions on avoiding anti-Russia coverage of the invasion, NextShark previously reported.

3/2/2022,"Adrian Hij/Getty Images Heading to the coast for a seaside trip is what vacation dreams are made of. Soaking in the sun while feeling the warm sand between your toes as the shore laps against your feet makes for a magical scene. However, there are still a few things to be wary of when spending time at the beach — namely, some very specific water safety tips to keep in mind. While you may know a thing or two about traditional rip currents and changing tides, you may not be aware of the dangers of square waves. Yes, this is a real thing — and a truly stunning phenomenon at that — but it's also one of the most dangerous sights to see in the water. Known as a ""cross sea,"" a square wave occurs when two swells meet to form a square, often resembling a checkerboard pattern. As the European Space Agency explained in 2010, ""The conditions are quite common in the ocean and occur when a windsea and a swell, or two swell systems, coexist."" It pointed to a 2004 study that showed ""a large percentage of ship accidents occurred in crossing sea states."" HowStuffWorks further explained, these square waves are rather rare, but when they do occur, they generally can be found along coastal areas. A prime place to view them from a safe distance is along the western coast of France on the Île de Ré. (If you want to really get into it, HowStuffWorks also pointed to a scientific breakdown of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation, which is why these waves form in the first place.) But these cross seas can form swells up to 10 feet high, as well as create unique wind patterns, making it difficult for boaters to navigate and swimmers to make their way through. So, again, while rare, if you do stumble across this, avoid heading out via a boat or swimming in the potentially rough seas. Instead, choose to spend your time relaxing on the sand, or just splash in the shallows for a refreshing dip and wait for better conditions to take your ocean plunge in peace and safety.",Science/Travel+Leisure,"Square Waves Are a Thing — and If You See Them, Get Out of the Water Immediately",https://news.yahoo.com/square-waves-thing-see-them-224757676.html
