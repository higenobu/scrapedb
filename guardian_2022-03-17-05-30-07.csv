3/17/2022,"A Labour MP is to appear on stage with Nigel Farage at the launch of an anti-net zero campaign for a referendum on policies to tackle climate change, amid anger from party colleagues. Graham Stringer, a prominent Brexiter who has previously appeared with Farage at pro-leave events and on his GB News show, was billed as appearing alongside the former Brexit party leader as well as Reform UK leader Richard Tice and the broadcaster Julia Hartley-Brewer. The Vote Power Not Poverty rally is scheduled to launch Farage’s campaign for a referendum on net zero, taking in place in Bolton next Saturday. It is understood the Labour leader’s office are concerned by the appearance. The release from Farage’s campaign said the rally would be going ahead in an as-yet-undisclosed location after the previous venue owned by Bolton Wanderers Football Club cancelled the booking. The club said that the event “will not be happening” and that it was “not something the club and business wishes to be associated with”. Stringer, who rebelled on numerous occasions over Brexit legislation, has long expressed doubts about climate policies and is a trustee of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, the most prominent climate crisis-denying group in the UK. The MP for Blackley and Broughton has said he is not a climate change denier, but told the Independent in 2017: “I am sceptical about everything – that is what scientists are. But there has been an enormous amount of shoddy work masquerading as science with regards to climate change.” In recent weeks, Stringer has called for an end to the moratorium on fracking, called on Michael Gove to approve the Cumbria coalmine and wrote in an op-ed for the Daily Mail: “Our current energy policy has weakened the UK … the two great threats to world peace, Russia and China – who have no qualms about increasing their use of fossil fuels – have been getting stronger.” Stringer’s decision to share a platform with Farage is likely to come under new scrutiny amid a crackdown by Labour leader Keir Starmer on MPs taking part in events with the potential to embarrass the party. Labour threatened to withdraw the whip from 11 backbenchers who had given their support to a statement by the Stop the War campaign that blamed both Nato and Vladimir Putin for the war in Ukraine. All withdrew their backing for the statement and the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell pulled out of a rally by the group. A Labour source said: “The Labour party unequivocally condemns Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and is unwavering in our support for the Ukrainian people, and we’ve been clear about our views on Labour MPs sharing platforms with those who don’t take that view.” Gaya Sriskanthan, co-chair of grassroots organisation Momentum, said: “Graham Stringer’s embrace of climate denial is a stain on the Labour party. By backing fracking and joining the concerted right-wing attacks on climate action, alongside odious figures like Farage, Stringer is out of step not just with Labour policy, but with the country as a whole. “Keir Starmer should publicly demand Stringer withdraw from this rally, end his support for fracking and commit to stop denying climate science. Or is it one rule for left-wing MPs in Labour and another for right-wingers like Stringer?”",News/Environment,Labour MP Graham Stringer to join Nigel Farage at anti-net zero rally,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/16/labour-mp-graham-stringer-join-nigel-farage-anti-net-zero-rally
3/17/2022,"Performed and captioned in Welsh, English and some French, Petula is a coproduction between Wales’s two national theatre companies and August012, and follows the intergalactic adventure of 12-year-old Pwdin Evans. Catapulted into space by his javelin-throwing stepfather – who acquired supernatural strength in a gleefully grisly duck à l’orange sacrifice – Pwdin steals away from earthbound angst, parental squabbles and French homework, and instead goes searching for his missing cousin, Petula. Directed by Mathilde López, and adapted and translated by Daf James from Fabrice Melquiot’s 2007 play Wanted Petula, it is a grotesque and absurd giddy fantasy from the outset. Partly a riff on The Little Prince, it similarly takes wild flights of fancy unencumbered by naturalistic logic. Performed among thousands of small black balls, bodies hide, writhe and glide across the stage. Jean Chan’s design sets Pwdin’s journey in the gap between innocence and knowing; the tactile playthings of childhood now hint towards something far more sensual and mysterious. Joe Price’s lighting is gorgeous – fluorescent tubes that progressively fill the night sky – and Lopez’s direction is dexterous and fine. Through juddering rides on the back of a flea or – in a poignant moment – the glimpse of a row of grandparents with their backs turned, the show is filled with stage images that expand the edges of the universe. It is gamely performed by an energetic cast who embrace its absurdities. As Pwdin, Dewi Wykes is endearing, carrying the weight of the world with the same ease with which he switches languages. Rachel Summers, as his stepmother Amethyst Crappp, Beyoncé and a hyperactive street-dancing fake Little Prince, is also wonderful. Clearly put together with a lot of love, this is stylish and sophisticated fare that packs a lot within its 80 minutes but simultaneously ends too abruptly, and the play’s darker nuances are elided by fanciful whimsy. Like Pwdin himself, perhaps, Petula’s persuasive profundity feels untethered to the world, as if his interplanetary adventure is missing an act: the beginning suggests the start of something epic, but it all comes back down to earth too soon. At the Sherman theatre, Cardiff, until 19 March. Then touring until 8 April.",Arts/Stage,Petula review – giddy intergalactic voyage ends with a bump,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/16/petula-review-interplanetary-adventure-ends-with-bump
3/17/2022,"Good morning. Joe Biden has called Vladimir Putin a war criminal for the first time since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It comes amid reports that Russian forces shot and killed 10 people waiting for bread. Scott Morrison faces criticism over his aged-care sector bonus scheme, and rental tenants feel the heat. The international court of justice in The Hague has ordered Russia to halt its invasion, saying it has not seen any evidence for the Kremlin’s justification of the war, namely that Ukraine was committing genocide against Russian speakers in the country’s east. The US has pledged an additional $800m in security assistance to Ukraine, after Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s empassioned address to the US Congress. Invoking Pearl Harbor and the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Ukraine president warned that “the destiny of our country is being decided”. In Mariupol Russian forces have been accused of “purposefully and cynically” bombing a theatre in which civilians were sheltering, city officials have reported. And Moscow has defaulted on a crucial bond payment of $117m which could bring serious economic hardship upon the Russian economy. The Morrison government has been accused of “a lot of show and not a lot of go” over aged-care sector payments, with providers scathing about an $800 bonus scheme that would require the cash-strapped sector to pay out to staff before it receives official approval and reimbursements. The federal government announced in January that more than 265,000 staff would receive up to two cash instalments but that is reliant upon providers first paying out, then lodging applications for reimbursement. Only about 20% of businesses have done so, citing frustration at the “overly bureaucratic and slow process”. Millions of eligible Australians have failed to get their third Covid-19 vaccine shot, as the booster rollout continues to lag behind most OECD nations. As many as 7 million Australians are eligible for boosters that they haven’t taken up yet, with epidemiologists calling for targeted media campaigns for 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds, amid perceptions of a reduced threat from the Omicron variant. Tenancy rights groups are calling for better cooling requirements for rental properties, after a major report found overheated properties were impairing sleep for residents up to 45% of the time. Australia could be holding critically low levels of fuel, a risk exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A report into the issue has not been released by the federal government, citing “cabinet-in-confidence”. Victoria’s duck hunting season is under way, with wildlife veterinarians recording several deaths of threatened species, including the blue-winged shoveler. 2022 will be the longest season since 2018. Two Russian oligarchs active in the Australian energy sector have been left off Australia’s local sanctions list, despite both being subjected to US sanctions in 2018 and one being sanctioned last week by the UK due to connections to Vladimir Putin. An eighth Mexican journalist has been shot dead, with press activists slamming the country’s “apathy” over the growing number of murders in 2022 alone. Armando Linares López worked to expose corruption but was shot outside his home in Zitácuro. Germany has recorded its highest single-day Covid-19 infection tally yet, with 262,593 positive infections recorded during Wednesday; 269 people with the virus died. A powerful 7.3-magnitude earthquake has struck off the Japanese coast of Fukushima, triggering a tsunami warning and plunging more than 2m homes into darkness. It’s 11 years since a tsunami devastated the town. Microplastics from European rivers are finding their way to Arctic seas, research suggests. Researchers warn that better waste management is required so the health of the Arctic ecosystem is not compromised. For the Lismore antique dealer Simon Robinson, there’s little that’s replaceable after flooding destroyed artefacts, memories and local treasures. Victorian-era parasols, rare photos of Charles Kingsford Smith and, more personally, the only photos he had of his father. As a local curator, Jennifer Gall, tells Elias Visontay, “This loss of identity and personal treasures is doubly devastating after losing a house and other important possessions.” And with thousands of residents set to jettison lifetimes’ worth of memories, the cultural loss of the floods to the region could be felt for decades. “There are atrocities documented on the Killing Times map that are literally unspeakable.” Indigenous affairs editor, Lorena Allam, read all 415 entries into the project over the past three years and recalls events so monstrous she “could not say the words out loud”. But living in these memories, and recounting them is also exhausting for the families and survivors. “Aboriginal people already know what happened and, in many cases, are tired of talking about it. Because sharing their pain does not guarantee the most important thing: justice.” House prices rose a staggering 24% last year. And while this was largely expected, the numbers are no less intimidating, Greg Jericho argues. Nor is there any immediate let-up in sight: “If the relationship between home loans and property prices holds, we should expect an annual rise in prices to slow from the current 24% to just below 15% by June this year – but that would still be among the fastest growth this century.” Gabbi Bolt fears her sense of humour might be too “silly” for Guardian Australia’s 10 funniest things on the internet. Unlikely. And if you came for Julie Andrews as you’ve never seen her before, you’ll likely stay for two drunk duelling pianists. It’s a trial that has polarised the Northern Territory.

3/17/2022,"As Russia has pursued its war with Ukraine, it has held parallel negotiations with Kyiv ostensibly seeking a peace deal from its own invasion of a neighbouring country. Those talks, which appeared to be a sideshow to the continuing war, received an unexpected boost on Wednesday as both sides indicated that discussions had yielded some progress. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said that the Russians were sounding “more realistic”, while the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said they were “close to agreeing” acceptable terms for a future Ukrainian neutrality. But any lasting peace depended on convincing the Kremlin it could not achieve victory on the battlefield, analysts said. “Some chances are there but I’m pretty sceptical that a negotiated solution will be achieved in those talks,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center. “Russia will not only seek leverage for the talks on the battleground but will seek victory on the battleground. If the more gentle – if you can call it that – tactics are not working, then Russia will just unleash all of their firepower. On Kyiv in particular.” Putin gave a defiant speech to top officials on Wednesday in which he said Russia’s “special military operation” was going to plan and that Russia would achieve its goals in Ukraine and not bow to the west. Using highly charged rhetoric, Putin likened the west to Nazi Germany by accusing it of launching an economic “blitzkrieg” against Russia in order to “demoralise our society, to bulldoze us”. An information campaign launched against Russia in western media and on social media networks had “direct analogues to the antisemitic pogroms carried out by Nazis in Germany in the 1930s”, Putin said. At home, he decried the “national traitors” and “fifth column” who had protested and spoken out against the war, signalling a further crackdown on the Russian opposition. And in Ukraine, he said that Russia would achieve its goals of Kyiv’s “demilitarisation” and of a political purge that he has termed “denazification”. It was a vintage performance from the Russian leader that seemed to ignore his military’s early setbacks in the war, which had led to an apparent softening in the Russian negotiating position. Ukraine’s staunch defence of key cities such as Kharkiv and Kyiv and mounting economic pressure from western sanctions have seen Russia tone down some of its most aggressive demands, including signals it would seek regime change in Ukraine.Zelenskiy said in a video address on Wednesday: “All wars end in agreements … As I am told, the positions in the negotiations sound more realistic. “However, time is still needed for the decisions to be in Ukraine’s interests.” Elements of a potential agreement came into focus on Wednesday. A draft document first published by the Financial Times indicated that Russia would seek a Ukrainian declaration of “neutrality” and limits on the size of its army. The Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the draft only reflected Russian demands, saying that Ukraine wanted a ceasefire, Russian troop withdrawal, and legally binding security guarantees from Russian aggression. While Russia has taken ground in southern Ukraine and is manoeuvring toward Kyiv, it was clearly expecting a shorter and less costly war. And those mounting costs on Russia, including some clear signs of queasiness inside the system, may influence a key decision-maker that a pause to the violence may be in his interest, if not a lasting settlement. “Fundamentally, the space for an agreement is all in Vladimir Putin’s head,” said Sam Greene, a professor in Russian politics and director of the Russia Institute at King’s College London. “This isn’t the question of what Kyiv can offer to what would be acceptable to Moscow. It’s not a question of what the west can offer. It’s a question of what Putin can talk himself into accepting.” Inspired by its early successes on the battlefield, Ukraine has also indicated that it will not capitulate to Russian demands. The Ukrainians are saying that “the Russians understand they can’t achieve these objectives they set for themselves and we hear that, it gives us some optimism”, according to Orysia Lutsevych, the head of the Ukraine Forum in the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House. “Their positions are still very far from reaching an agreement.” Some questions, such as the status of Russian-occupied Crimea and eastern Ukraine, could prove to be stumbling blocks in further negotiations. So could the Russian demands, repeated in an aggressive Putin speech on Wednesday, for Ukrainian “demilitarisation” and a political purge. And Ukraine will want to have ironclad security guarantees, probably ensured by the west, as fears remain that Russia could use any ceasefire as an excuse to resupply its troops before continuing its onslaught. Nonetheless, there is space for a deal on the Ukrainian side as well, as there is “a realistic understanding that we need to save the Ukrainian state, we need to make sure that Ukraine controls as much territory as possible”, said Lutsevych. For now, analysts said they expected the talks could at most yield a temporary ceasefire or interim deal rather than any kind of lasting Russian withdrawal. Nonetheless, there are worrying signs that Russia is planning to intensify its attacks and bombardments of cities to give it greater leverage in negotiations. “Strategically in Ukraine, there is an understanding that as long as Putinism is the policy of the Russian Federation, we are all in a very fragile state and Ukraine is at existential risk,” said Lutsevych.",News/World news,"Hopes rise for Ukraine talks, but experts doubt Russia will pull out",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/hopes-rise-for-ukraine-talks-but-experts-doubt-russia-will-pull-out
3/17/2022,"Boris Johnson has hinted Saudi Arabia could speed up oil production to help calm spiralling energy prices for Britons, as he praised the country for improving its human rights record despite three more people being executed during his visit. With pressure rising at home over a cost of living crisis compounded by western countries trying to end their reliance on Russian imports, the UK prime minister made a dash to the Middle East to urge leaders to help stabilise oil prices by ramping up supply. Johnson said there was “a lot of agreement” in his meeting with Saudi Arabia’s ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, adding that efforts should be made to ensure “the global economy is not damaged by the current spikes”. On the same day, the Saudi government executed three more citizens. It came days after the largest state killing in the kingdom’s history of 81 men. The UN said half were Muslims from the Shia minority and had taken part in protests calling for greater political participation a decade ago. Johnson’s visit was heavily restricted for media, with government sources claiming No 10 wanted to draw relatively little attention to it. Though unable to announce any firm commitments after touring the Saudi Arabian and UAE capitals, the prime minister said he made the case for why oil producing countries should try to steady prices to avoid a 1970s-style energy crisis. In a short interview afterwards, Johnson insisted there was “a lot of agreement that it is important to avoid inflation” and the “damaging economic consequences” that could follow. Oil prices had been trading at a 14-year high of close to $130 a barrel after Russian president Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine. However, the price slid to about $100 on Wednesday amid continuing ceasefire talks. Johnson was pessimistic that he would be able to open up the spare capacity of the Saudi-led Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) to soften the blow of divesting from Russian fossil fuels. But he stressed the west needed energy independence and countries now realised they had made a mistake by building up dependence on Russian hydrocarbons, allowing Putin to blackmail nations and hold their economies to ransom. Asked if he raised the recent mass executions, Johnson only said: “I always raise human rights issues, as British prime ministers before me have done, time after time. It’s best if the details of those conversations are kept private, they’re more effective that way.” He claimed that “in spite” of the killings, “things are changing in Saudi Arabia” and added: “That’s why we see value in engaging with Saudi Arabia and why we see value in the partnership.” The human rights charity group Reprieve said the three people killed – Bandar al-Zahrani, Hamid al-Osaimi and Muhannad al-Assiri – were all Saudi nationals accused of murder. “By travelling to meet Mohammed bin Salman so soon after a mass execution, Boris Johnson clearly signalled that in return for oil, the UK will tolerate even the gravest human rights abuses,” Reprieve’s director Maya Foa said. “Today’s executions are the immediate result. The prime minister has blood on his hands. “Carrying out these executions while the leader of a western power is on Saudi soil was provocative act, designed to flaunt the crown prince’s power and impunity to the world. “It is not acceptable to cite Russia’s war crimes to try to justify trading blood for oil elsewhere. It shows the world we will apply double standards for our convenience, and embolden countries like Saudi Arabia into further atrocities, just as Putin was emboldened by our willingness to take his cronies’ cash for decades.” Saudi Arabia is one of 38 countries still to use the death penalty and Salman is believed by US intelligence to have ordered the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Despite Johnson’s tough talk about taking action against authoritarian regimes, he had been criticised before the trip by Keir Starmer. The Labour leader said that “going cap in hand from dictator to dictator is not an energy strategy”. Julian Lewis, a Conservative MP who chairs parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee, also called on the government to ensure that “in seeking to lessen our dependence upon one source of oil and gas, we do not end up creating a source dependency on another unreliable and sometimes hostile regime”.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson upbeat on Saudi oil supply as kingdom executes three more ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/16/boris-johnson-upbeat-on-saudi-oil-supply-as-kingdom-executes-three-more
