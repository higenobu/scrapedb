5/6/2022,"A Boston family is distraught after finding out that a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s default is to blame for their loved one’s tragic death. According to reports, 39-year-old Robinson Lalin was dragged 100 feet by a Boston train after getting trapped in the door last month. The trains are supposed to have a safety feature that stops them from moving when there is something between the doors, but federal investigators said they found a malfunction in a local control system. The MTA has identified the issue as a “short circuit.” Robinson’s nephew, Kelvin Lalin, has been sitting outside the station where his uncle was killed, holding a sign saying, “The MBTA Slaughtered My Uncle.” He said the tragedy has wrecked his family, and he won’t be leaving until his family “gets justice.” Robinson Lalin leaves behind two children. “He was literally slaughtered to death, my uncle did not deserve that. We’re grieving. My family is honestly devastated. And we’re even more devastated after reading the report,” Kelvin Lalin said. “This was a negligent situation it could have been avoided.” Robinson Lalin was exiting the Red Line train on April 10 when his arm got stuck in the door as it pulled away. The train carried his dangling body 100 feet on the platform onto to lower area near the tracks. He died on the scene. The National Transportation Safety Board launched an investigation the next day. The agency tested the equipment, reviewed security footage, observed train operations, conducted interviews and performed sight distance observations, according to reports. A full investigation may take up to a year. “NTSB investigators examined and tested the railcar involved after the accident, identifying a fault in a local door control system that enabled the train to move with the door obstructed,” the federal agency’s preliminary report said. The local transit authority inspected the Red Line fleet for similar problems in other trains. The MBTA said it found no other circuitry faults after conducting rigorous testing. The agency said it would implement additional regular testing to prevent the error again. WCVB 5 reports that the operator of the Red Line train involved in Robinson Lalin’s death is off of the job while the investigation unfolds, and she has worked for MBTA since 2018. Operators must check to see if the doors are clear before leaving the station, reports show. The MBTA has reportedly faced other safety problems over the last year. Nine people were injured in September when an escalator malfunctioned, and 25 people were hospitalized in July after two trolleys collided, according to reports. The MBTA has released a statement and made other public apologies, but Kelvin Lalin said that’s insufficient. The family also wants to see the surveillance video from the night Robinson Lalin died. “I want to hear from the MBTA. They’ve said sorry in a board meeting, but that’s not enough. You haven’t called me. You haven’t spoken to my mother or grandmother,” he said. “We deserve an apology. We deserve something from the MBTA. They’re responsible for it.”",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,‘He Was Literally Slaughtered’: Boston Man Dragged 100 Feet to His Death By Arm Caught In Faulty Train Door; Family Claims They’ve Not Received an Apology for ‘Negligent Situation’,https://news.yahoo.com/literally-slaughtered-boston-man-dragged-163000081.html
5/6/2022,"In 2014, Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes was dominating the front covers of renowned business magazines for being the youngest self-made billionaire in the world. In 2022, she’s making headlines again ––but for all the wrong reasons. A recent Hulu series, The Dropout, has led to more interest in Holmes, her relationship with former COO Sunny Balwani, and where she is today. Here's the background on Holmes' story, what she and Balwani are doing today, and what the future could hold. Holmes had a childhood dream of becoming a billionaire. At 19, she dropped out of Stanford to work on her ""revolutionary"" blood-testing startup called Theranos. With Theranos, Holmes promised to eliminate needles from the blood testing process, claiming that her ""proprietary"" machine called the ""Edison"" could deliver cheaper and faster results for over 240 diseases with a single pin-prick and a drop of blood. Holmes was a descendant of the family that founded America’s first yeast company and was also the daughter of a former Enron VP and congressional aide. Her pedigreed background helped link Theranos with some of the biggest names in America. She appointed luminaries like former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and ex-director of CDC William Foege to her board of directors and landed contracts with industry giants like Pfizer and Safeway. She even convinced high-profilers like Oracle founder Larry Ellison and pharmacy leader Walgreens to invest in her startup, raising over $700 million without ever disclosing how her technology worked. This secrecy reflected the company’s work culture and Elizabeth herself, who hired bodyguards to drive her around, installed bulletproof glass in her office windows, and forbade employees from discussing projects with workers in other departments. Holmes enjoyed the media spotlight, speaking at TED Talks and panels with Bill Clinton and Jack Ma. By 2014, Theranos had testing centers in 40 Walgreens stores and was valued at a whopping $9 billion. But while all this was happening, skeptics started questioning Holmes’ claims. In 2014, Theranos employee Tyler Schultz called out Holmes for ignoring failed quality control checks in the testing process. Despite receiving threats from Holmes, Tyler contacted the Public Health Laboratory in New York, alleging that Theranos was doctoring research and manipulating its proficiency testing. By 2015, the FDA was investigating Theranos, finding “major inaccuracies” in the tests it was performing on patients. For example, a Theranos STD test claimed it was accurate 95% of the time. But regulators found the results to be accurate only 65% to 80% of the time. Holmes’ misdeeds caught public attention when WSJ reporter John Carreyrou published a series of reports exposing her lies and flawed blood test results. Soon after, Walgreens sued Theranos for $140 million dollars for misleading them about the capabilities of the technology. In 2016, the SEC slapped Holmes and her ex-boyfriend and Theranos COO Sunny Balwani with 11 felony counts for fraud against investors and patients. Theranos completely shut down by 2019. Holmes’ trial began in September 2021 and prosecutors and witnesses exposed her as a fraud. Here are some of the most shocking revelations of the trial: To get investor funding, Holmes claimed that the world’s 10 largest pharmaceutical companies had validated Theranos’ results. They had not. Holmes allegedly forged Pfizer’s logo and letterhead on the lab results she showed to investors to make them think she had contracts with Pfizer. Theranos hid its inaccuracies by substituting Edison’s reports with results from regular blood draws done on traditional machines; in fact, most tests were run on regular machines. Whistleblowers testified to Holmes firing engineers who told her the Edison didn’t work. Ex-Theranos patients testified against the health tech company for providing faulty test results. One such patient was Brittany Gould, who was told that she was having a miscarriage when, in fact, she had a healthy pregnancy. Because of the false positive, she changed the medication she was taking, which could have harmed the fetus. Elizabeth Holmes’ central defense was that her manipulations were in the spirit of progress and that she was simply trying to make the company succeed. “Coming up short is not a crime,” she said. She also blamed her ex-partner Sunny Balwani for most of the wrongdoings, claiming that he controlled and abused her throughout their relationship, which hindered her decision-making. Holmes’ lawyer presented a handwritten note that outlined her daily schedule and affirmations which, according to Holmes, Balwani dictated along with how she should act and speak. “I speak rarely. When I do—CRISP and CONCISE. I call bullshit immediately. My hands are always in my pockets or gesturing,” the last few lines of the note read. Balwani and his lawyers have denied the abuse claims, calling them “salacious and inflammatory” and remain firm that Holmes was the final decision-maker of the company, not Balwani. But recently, a series of text exchanges between Balwani and Holmes came forward, suggesting Balwani had more power than he admits. “I am responsible for everything at Theranos,” Balwani wrote in a text to Holmes, as reported by NBC. After a lengthy trial and almost 30 witnesses, the court found Holmes guilty of four counts of criminal fraud against investors with 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each of her convictions. The jury acquitted Holmes of charges of fraud against patients. Because the conviction was for a non-violent, white-collar crime, legal experts think it’s likely that Holmes will only spend three years behind bars, and that too in a premium prison with low security and plenty of facilities like pilates classes, tennis courts, and arts programs. The recent birth of her baby boy with husband Billy Evans could further reduce her sentence. White-collar defense lawyer Amanda Kramer told NPR that Holmes’ case is a deterrent for business owners who may intend to commit fraud. She said it would be ""utterly shocking"" if Holmes dodged imprisonment. Balwani is going through a separate trial for fraud along with the abuse allegations. According to Kramer, Balwani’s case affects Holmes’ sentence, which is why the court has set her sentencing date in September 2022. Once touted “the next Steve Jobs” with a net worth of $4.5 billion, Elizabeth Holmes has fallen from grace (and money) and is now worth $0, according to Forbes. Currently out on a $500,000 bail bond, Holmes is living it up in her $135 million Green Gables estate in Silicon Valley with her husband and son. After working at companies like Microsoft and Lotus, Sunny made his riches after founding his e-commerce startup CommerceBid at the peak of the dot-com bubble in the late 90s. After the industry burst, he pursued further studies and, at 37, went to China as part of a summer program where he met 18-year-old Elizabeth. After 3 years in 2005, the two started dating and Sunny gave Holmes a $13 million personal loan to help fund Theranos. In 2009, Sunny became the president and COO, reigning the Theranos C-suite with Holmes until the pair split in 2016 and he quit the company. As a key decision-maker in Theranos, Sunny has been charged with the same counts as Holmes and is going through a separate trial that began in March 2022. It has been reported that he just sold the luxury home he and Holmes co-owned (later bought out by Balwani) for almost $16 million as he plows money for his ongoing litigation.

5/6/2022,"A newly filed lawsuit from the building management of a luxury Upper East Side apartment building alleges that a resident who swims in the wrong communal pool lanes has also pooped in it—but 83-year-old Helen Hirsh told The Daily Beast that it’s the condo’s management that’s full of it. Attorneys for Rio The Condominium and Spa on East 65 St. alleged in court documents on Wednesday that Hirsh “defecated in the Fitness Center's pool and then again in the Fitness Center shower.” “The Condominium was forced to shut down the Fitness Center's pool so that it could be properly sanitized according to the applicable State health code, and to the applicable State health code, and to take the Fitness Center's shower out of use so that it could be cleaned and disinfected. As a result, other unit owners and residents were unable to use the pool or the shower during those times,” the complaint said. The suit also alleges that Hirsh “screams and makes loud noises while using the gym and the pool” and “failed on numerous occasions to wear proper attire in the gym (using the gym equipment in a wet bathing suit and not wearing proper athletic footwear) [or] to shower before using the pool.” After the Board suspended her access to those facilities, she found her way back in by “deceitfully obtaining a code to access the Fitness Center from a real estate broker who had been” showing it to potential buyers, “and has even forced her way into the Fitness Center when another resident was exiting through the Fitness Center door. Defendant has called the police to the Building when Building staff have attempted to restrict her access to the Fitness Center.” In a late-night Wednesday interview with The Daily Beast, Hirsh says the allegations are mostly false and that she would file a counter lawsuit. “No, this is really ridiculous; I was a doctor before,” Hirsh told The Daily Beast when asked about swimming in incorrect pool lanes. “I don’t know how to swim; I always swim near the wall, you know, near the wall.” “I am scared,” she admitted, while sharing that her doctor assigned her to daily workouts in the pool after breaking her leg, which she says left her disabled. “Of course, you [swim] near the wall!” “Ya, I don’t know how to swim. I am not very good, so,” Hirsh said with a chuckle. Asked about the pooping allegation, she responded: “No, never,” then added, “Maybe I am getting old.” She asked, “Do they have evidence? Ridiculous, I was a doctor before!” Then she alleged that management secretly wanted to get her out of her one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment in the building, which she moved into last year, because she isn't a big tipper. Listings show one-bedroom apartments in the condo asking well over $1 million and mention “incredible amenities including a 24-hour doorman, a well-equipped gym with a 50’ indoor lap swimming pool, hot tub, wood sauna, steam shower, furnished panoramic roof deck with a kitchen, ground-floor garden, central laundry room, and a live-in super.” “Listen, listen, I tell you... this is ridiculous, I don’t want to live here anymore,” she said, while alleging that her problems stem from not giving “tips, tips, tips” to the building staff. “I’m an old lady. Why should I tip you all the time?” “Tomorrow, I go to court to sue them,” Hirsh said. “I want to sue the management company!” Asked what she would file suit over, the resident declared “wrong information” being placed within the public record by the management of her own building. The lawyer representing the building—which is seeking both “injunctive relief” and “money damages,” citing the need to make repairs to the building, including the ’“sanitizing [of] potentially harmful conditions”—didn’t return The Daily Beast’s request for comment on Wednesday night.

5/6/2022,"MIAMI (AP) — A little-noticed federal appeals court ruling this year threatens a key weapon in the United States’ war on drugs: A decades-old law that gives the U.S. broad authority to make high-seas arrests anywhere in the world, even if the drugs aren’t bound for American shores. It’s a law that’s used to round up and imprison hundreds of foreigners every year, mostly poor, semi-literate fishermen from Central and South America who make up the drug trade’s lowest rungs. “It is a waste of U.S. taxpayer dollars to have these costly misadventures as we play drug police to the world,” said Eric Vos, head of the public defender’s office in Puerto Rico that brought the court challenge. At issue is the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act, which defines drug smuggling in international waters as a crime against the United States and gives the U.S. unique arrest powers anywhere on the seas — whenever it determines a vessel is “without nationality.” But how a vessel is deemed stateless sometimes gets messy. The was the case for the Costa Rican plaintiff Jeffri Dávila-Reyes, whose appeal prompted the ruling. The Coast Guard chased down his speedboat in the western Caribbean in 2015 as he and two cousins were allegedly transporting five to 15 kilos of cocaine. They identified their vessel as hailing from Costa Rica, according to the FBI’s summary of the investigation, but they lacked any documentation. When the U.S. asked the Costa Rican government to confirm the vessel’s registry, it responded 12 weeks after the bust that it could neither confirm nor refute the claim. A few weeks later the men were charged and eventually pleaded guilty to possessing narcotics “on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.” But a three-judge panel of the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston ruled in January that one of the law’s provisions — disavowing a captain’s claim of nationality — were an unconstitutional extension of U.S. policing powers beyond America’s borders. Tellingly, almost none of those arrested under the law had ever set foot in the U.S. nor were they charged with trying to import cocaine. In Dávila-Reyes’ case, the cocaine he was accused of transporting was purportedly headed to Jamaica. Despite the ruling that threw out his conviction, Dávila-Reyes remains behind bars seven years into a 10-year sentence as the Justice Department seeks reconsideration by all of the First Circuit’s nine judges. In a series of recent letters to The Associated Press from federal prison, Davila-Reyes reflected on how he only got involved in smuggling as a way to escape poverty in his homeland after years of hand-blistering construction work for $10 a day. He said taking a chance on smuggling offered him $6,000. “Nobody can be blamed for being born poor,” he wrote. From the moment President Richard Nixon declared “war on drugs” in 1971, the U.S. Coast Guard has been at the forefront of the campaign to stop illegal narcotics from entering the U.S. Today, it spends more than $2 billion annually as part of that effort. But, almost from the start, that goal has proven elusive. Cocaine prices, a gauge of supply, have been hovering at historical lows for more than a decade as cocaine production from Colombia has soared to record highs. In a good year, barely 10% of cocaine shipments in the waters off Central and South America — where the bulk of the world’s cocaine is trafficked — are actually seized or destroyed, according to the U.S. government’s own estimates. Despite that poor record, U.S. officials continue to tout their success at sea. A 2020 Coast Guard report said at-sea interdictions are the most effective way to combat cartels and criminal networks. Since 2017, the amount of cocaine it has seized or destroyed exceeds 959 metric tons. Prosecutions under the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act exploded last year to 296 — nearly five times the number a decade ago, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, which collects Justice Department data. But since each case involves multiple defendants, the actual number of foreigners detained at sea last year was 635 — the highest tally since 2017. Critics of U.S. drug policy say most such smugglers fell into the job because of poverty and are hardly worth locking up for so long when legions of their poor compatriots stand ready to take their place. “These are not masterminds like Pablo Escobar or Chapo Guzman,” said Kendra McSweeney, an Ohio State University geographer who has spent years researching U.S. drug policies. Neither the Coast Guard nor Justice Department would comment on Dávila-Reyes’ appeal but experts say it’s too early to judge the fallout from the landmark ruling. Currently Vos’ office in Puerto Rico is preparing 14 motions for dismissal in other boat cases on behalf of jailed defendants from Colombia, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic. The ruling has also been cited in at least five proceedings outside the First Circuit. “It’s definitely a chink in the armor,” said Roger Cabrera, a court-appointed attorney in Miami seeking who has filed one of the appeals. “But like most chinks, I’m sure the federal government is already looking for a workaround.” For now, U.S. law enforcement continues to conduct regular search and seizures on the high seas with little indication of concern. In court filings, attorneys for the U.S. government have argued in part that holding up interdictions to wait for an unequivocal denial of registry from a foreign nation before declaring a vessel stateless would be impractical. “Anyone involved with bringing dangerous drugs into the United States will be held accountable, no matter their position in the drug-distribution network,” said Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman. ___ Contact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/",U.S./Associated Press,Ruling threatens US power as world's high-seas drug police,https://news.yahoo.com/ruling-threatens-us-power-worlds-162955758.html
