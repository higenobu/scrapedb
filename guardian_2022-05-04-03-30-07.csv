5/4/2022,"“We’re backing Britain,” declared BP’s chief executive, Bernard Looney, on Tuesday, which was a cuter spin on record quarterly profits of $6.2bn (£5bn) than his boast last November about running “a cash machine”. A debate about windfall taxes has raged ever since last autumn’s remark, which, note, was made when oil prices were $20-a-barrel lower than today’s. But here’s a key point about BP’s plan to spend “up to” £18bn in the UK by the end of the decade in a programme spanning North Sea oil and gas, offshore wind, hydrogen facilities, electric vehicle charging points and carbon capture projects: it’s not new. The collection of projects is merely a tally of previously announced plans, some of which were backed even when BP’s cashpoint was suffering a relative splutter. The big offshore wind programme in the Irish Sea, for example, was unveiled 15 months ago. At the margin, some North Sea oil and gas investments may have been accelerated, but it’s hard to be precise. The big picture is that BP has carefully shifted over time from investing about 10%-15% of its global capital expenditure in the UK, which was the approximate position over the past decade, to spending roughly 15%-20%. The change makes sense. In the renewables arena, where more of the cash is going, the UK’s tax and incentive set-up is seen as more attractive than that of international peers. Thus, from a purely economic perspective, BP’s £18bn parade of projects shouldn’t change the windfall tax debate one jot. The investments would happen anyway – a point Looney more or less conceded. Indeed, just by considering the back-of-the-envelope arithmetic, one can see why the financial dial wouldn’t move. The little secret about the Labour party’s version of windfall tax is that it is very modest. The formula imagines an increase from 40% to 50% in the tax rate on North Sea oil and gas profits, which in BP’s case would merely turn an expected £1bn tax bill for the relevant assets this year into one of £1.25bn. An extra £250m would not explode BP’s precious “long-term financial framework”, which has already withstood the mega Rosneft write-off and will stay pay investors £4bn in dividends this year, with possibly the same again via share buybacks. BP’s 10-year investment plans would not be upset; pensioners and pension funds would not be impoverished; life would go on. By the same token, though, Labour should stop giving the impression that a windfall tax is some form of cure-all for the crisis in consumers’ energy bills. On the party’s original January formulation of its tax, the projected total from across the entire North Sea industry was just £1.2bn. Even if one assumes that a higher oil price (and thus corporate profits) would add a bit, we’re not talking about game-changing sums. For context, it would cost £10bn to give 10 million lower-income households a £1,000 saving on their bills for a single year. In the end, the politics of a windfall tax will probably hinge on how long oil remains at $100-plus a barrel, and how long an effective “Ukraine war premium” persists, as argued here last week. After a while, the charge becomes hard to resist. The view here is that it would be reasonable already for the Treasury to claim a few extra quid in the interest of fairness. But let’s not pretend that a windfall tax would make the energy crisis go away. Ping An move puts yet more strain on HSBC’s double life As with most things Chinese and corporate, it’s hard to know if local insurer Ping An has been prodded by Beijing to lobby HSBC to break itself up. Either way, this show should run a while. First, because Ping An is a serious shareholder with a 8% stake. Second, because there’s a good question at the heart: would HSBC be better off if it split its Asian and western operations? As it is, HSBC’s double life as a UK-regulated bank that makes most of its money in Hong Kong has rarely looked so challenged. Executives have to engage in verbal gymnastics every time Beijing launches another crackdown on dissidents in Hong Kong, for example. Further deterioration in US-China relations may eventually make the act impossible to perform. On the other hand, Ping An’s apparent belief that a liberated Asian operation would enjoy a higher stock-market rating looks questionable; it ain’t necessarily so. But the Chinese group will perform a useful service if it makes HSBC’s chairman, Mark Tucker, and its chief executive, Noel Quinn, sing for their supper. The bank has been a disappointment to its shareholders – eastern and western alike – for years.",News/Business,Windfall tax would make little difference to BP’s parade of projects,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/may/03/windfall-tax-debate-bp-profits-labour
5/4/2022,"There has been a fair amount of fretting about the prospect of Ben Stokes, England Test captain. Even after a weary Joe Root called him before Easter to explain he was stepping down from the job, his wife, Clare, immediately said “oh no, oh no, oh no”, knowing full well what was likely to follow. Yet as Stokes strolled into the Colin Milburn Lounge at Durham’s Riverside Ground on Tuesday, decked out in grey-blue England training gear and that fiery red hair slicked back like a Peaky Blinder, he looked like a man at peace with the promotion. This may be an almighty Hail Mary from English cricket, one that heaps even more responsibility on to the shoulders of a champion all-rounder who needed a spell out of the game last year, but you would scarcely have known it. Indeed, over the next 20 minutes or so Stokes spoke with impressive assuredness. Had he coveted the role? Not at all, but he would never turn it down either. Did he still need time to decide when Rob Key, the new director of men’s cricket, offered him the role? A little, he said, which turned out to be barely a minute. Can he yank the handbrake on a team who have won just one of their past 17 Tests? The only way is up, Stokes replied, unwittingly channelling his inner Yazz and the Plastic Population. Even the Bristol incident in 2017, a subject Stokes has not always enjoyed engaging with publicly, was met with good grace. “Back then, no, I’d have never pictured sitting at a table speaking as England captain,” he said. That night on the tiles is not the only such brush with career seppuku along the way, having been thrown off a Lions tour in 2013 for drinking; the unfulfilled talent of Matt Coles, the other player sent packing by Andy Flower that day, shows what easily could have been. But while Stokes may be as raw a captain as England have had in the team’s 145-year history – the first Test against West Indies in 2020, when Root was on paternity leave, remains his only first-class match in charge – he believes these experiences will serve to inform his leadership positively; so, too, a rollercoaster playing career that has featured the crushing low of that horror last over in the 2016 World T20 final and those immortalising twin peaks of Lord’s and Headingley in 2019. And then there is the spell out last year for mental health reasons; the “dark place” that related to the grief of losing his father, Ged, months earlier and was triggered by a finger injury as he tried to plough on. Aside from the unsuccessful past tenures of Ian Botham and Andrew Flintoff, and the demands of captaining as an all-rounder – “I’ve had to deal with those comparisons since I was 18,” he said with a shrug – that four-month absence is the main source of angst regarding his succession of Root. But for Stokes, who revealed he is still in regular contact with a therapist, the spell out was a show of strength. “The hardest thing to do in the first place is to talk to somebody,” he said, adding that any player in similar strife could come to him. Asked how his old man, a teak-tough New Zealand rugby league international back in the day, would react to his son captaining England, he replied: “He followed me everywhere and thought he knew better than me. If he was still around, he’d be telling me how to do this job already. But yeah, he’d be very, very proud.” Stokes inherited his father’s headstrong character and, by his own admission, has tended to go with his gut in the past. But the 30-year-old all-rounder has clearly put a lot of thought into his style of leadership: he wants players to follow his selfless, team-first approach, never dwell too heavily on failure and take the positive option where possible. There was also an insistence that senior players chip in tactically, not least as regards when best to bowl himself, and quipped that his time keeping on the field will also need some help given he never usually knows when the intervals are. And though there is a head coach still to be hired and a squad to be selected before the first Test against New Zealand on 2 June, Stokes has already taken some tactical decisions: as well as demanding Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad be returned to fold, he will also drop down to No 6 in the batting order. He intends to play a full role with bat and ball, not simply focus on the former, and believes the extra breathing space will help here. It looks a sound call, even if the knock-on effect – Jonny Bairstow either moving to No 5 and nudging out a hopeful, or returning behind the stumps and seeing Ben Foakes once again step aside – is yet to be settled upon. There is plenty more to ponder besides before Stokes walks out for the toss at Lord’s; even his own fitness after a knee issue needs to be ticked off, starting with a return to face Worcestershire this Thursday. He also acknowledged the low ebb from which England start out, insisting it has “not been good enough”. Having made Test cricket his priority, he also hopes expectations will be tempered a touch while he, Key and the incoming head coach get to work on long-term solutions. There are no guarantees of success or that the concerns about over-burdening the team’s talisman won’t come to pass. Nevertheless, this was a positive first outing from Ben Stokes, England Test captain. Like Durham, celebrating 30 years as a first-class county this summer, he has come a long way in a short space of time.",Sport/Sport,Impressive Ben Stokes passes first exam as England’s Test captain,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/03/impressive-ben-stokes-passes-first-exam-as-englands-test-captain
5/4/2022,"Covid fines should be overturned en masse in light of the prime minister’s defence for attending lockdown-breaching events, a lawyer has argued, as it emerged more than 20 penalties imposed on businesses had been struck down in recent months. Lucinda Nicholls, who successfully represented 23 firms and is still fighting on behalf of seven more, said serious deficiencies in the evidence presented against her clients – as well as Boris Johnson’s own apparent confusion about how to apply his own rules – called every penalty imposed under Covid legislation into question. “Boris Johnson said he found the regulations confusing. Considering they changed about 12 times, it is understandable someone might be confused,” she said. The lawyer, from the firm Nicholls & Nicholls, added: “In the context of Partygate, the government should be overhauling all of the Covid fines issued to individuals and businesses. “If the government that brought in the legislation had difficulties with regard to the exemptions and the defences, then that demonstrates that there is clearly going to be confusion among the local authorities and the police in relation to enforcement.” Gainz Fitness & Strength, an independent gym in Bedford, was one of the firms Nicholls represented. Its owner, Alex Lowndes, risked being penalised when he decided to stay open in November 2020. He felt so strongly about the issue that he had campaigned – albeit unsuccessfully – for the inclusion of a special, blanket lockdown exemption for gyms that same month. The BBC, which first reported on the overturning of the 23 penalties, said Lowndes denied breaching lockdown regulations when charged following a raid on his gym. The broadcaster said he faced a £10,000 fixed-penalty notice and was due to stand trial last March. But the council failed to gather sufficient evidence and its request for an adjournment was rejected by magistrates. Nicholls had argued on Lowndes’ behalf that his gym should benefit from the exemptions that were eventually included in the rules. Data released by the National Police Chiefs Council in March showed police in England and Wales issued 877 notices under business regulations – such as that given to Lowndes – while more than 100,000 were imposed on people over various other allegations. Yet more have been handed out by local councils. Nicholls said there was no prospect of appeal where the penalty had been paid, since this represented an admission of guilt, and said ministers should act to ensure all were overturned. Bedford borough council, which gave Lowndes a fixed-penalty notice, said regulations were enforced in line with its duty at the time. “We brought this case because there was ample evidence for a successful prosecution following the non-payment of a fixed-penalty notice and because it was in the public interest,” a council spokesperson told the BBC. “It is important that we remember that the threat posed by the virus then was very different to that which we face now. “The pandemic isn’t over but the combination of immunity from prior infection, vaccinations and antivirals has made it possible for us to return cautiously to the activities that we love.”",News/World news,"Partygate means all Covid fines should be overturned, lawyer argues",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/partygate-means-covid-fines-should-be-overturned-lawyer-argues
5/4/2022,"A frontrunner to be the next Metropolitan police commissioner has said she will not apply, leaving a former top cop turned thriller-writer as one of the favourites for the role. Lynne Owens was the previous director general of the National Crime Agency and stood down last year to focus on her treatment for cancer. On Tuesday she wrote on Twitter that she had spent weeks considering whether to apply for the post of Britain’s top officer, but her decision was not health related. Applications close on Wednesday for the £290,000-a-year post, which became vacant after the resignation of Cressida Dick following a series of scandals. Owens was an assistant commissioner in the Met, and then became the chief constable of Surrey. There she succeeded Mark Rowley, who has now emerged as one of the frontrunners to be Met commissioner. Rowley is a former head of counter-terrorism, who left policing in 2018. In the meantime, he has worked in the private sector, co-authored a report on extremism, and recently co-authored a thriller based on a female detective battling terrorist violence. Also likely to apply is Shaun Sawyer, currently the chief constable of the Devon and Cornwall force, who has previously served as a commander in Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command. Since Dick’s departure was announced in February potential applicants have been in touch with officials at the Home Office and the London mayor’s office. The next commissioner will be appointed by the home secretary, Priti Patel, who by law, has to take account of the views of London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, who is also the police and crime commissioner for London. Both government and City Hall believe the Met needs radical reform to boost falling public confidence, sapped by a series of scandals and concern how the force’s leadership dealt with them. Officials are said to be interested in an application from Andy Marsh, currently chief executive of the College of Policing, which sets standards for law enforcement. He has been the chief constable of Avon and Somerset and, before that, the Hampshire force. Among senior officers in the Met, assistant commissioner Nick Ephgrave, also another former chief constable of Surrey, may be considering a run. Matt Jukes, head of counter-terrorism and former chief of South Wales police, has also been considering applying. But he may sit this competition out and be a strong contender to be deputy commissioner and the heir apparent next time. Assistant commissioner Neil Basu, once seen as a strong contender to succeed Dick, has been discouraged by reports the government dislikes him for his comments on race, and is expected not to apply. He would have been the first ethnic minority Met commissioner. But he is understood to be among the final two candidates to be the next director general of the NCA. The process to appoint to this role is taking longer than expected, and the final two candidates are yet to go through the final stage, which is an interview with Patel. Owens’ decision not to apply means the field is likely to be male and white. Olivia Pinkney, chief constable in Hampshire, is not applying, and Lucy D’Orsi, chief of British Transport Police and before that a Met veteran, only recently took charge of the force that patrols Britain’s railways. Applications will be sifted through to create a shortlist of four or five candidates, it is believed, with interviews scheduled for three weeks’ time. The would-be Met commissioners will have to complete interactive assessments and other tests. The deadline for @metpoliceuk Commissioner applications is tomorrow. To prevent speculation & in the interests of transparency I’m not applying. I’m so grateful for the support I’ve had as I’ve worked through my decision 1/ Announcing her decision not to stand, Owens wrote on Twitter: “I’m so grateful for the support I’ve had as I’ve worked through my decision. “I do not intend to talk about my rationale other than to say it is not health related & I am actively looking for my next career challenge!

5/4/2022,"Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching Better Call Saul season six, which airs on Netflix in the UK. Do not read on unless you have watched episodes one to four. Where is Lalo? That’s the question everyone, including the viewer, is asking at the end of this brisk, unsettling episode which cranks up the tension again after last week’s moment of (tragic) catharsis. The person pondering the hardest is Gus Fring, who has decided he needs to live in two houses at once, such is the threat from his Salamanca arch enemy. In one home, the normal Fring set-up; nice kitchen, all his clothes folded neatly and stored in industrial quantities in plastic tubs. In the second home, connected to the first by a secret tunnel, there’s a decoy family and a security team watching possible approaches to house one from every conceivable angle. The conceit is set up in a gentle, incongruous cold open where we’re left to wonder quite what is going on (just one of many nice touches in this episode, directed by Rhea Seehorn, who plays Kim). It seems fair to say that Mike is puzzled, too. He’s put security everywhere he can think of, and some more places on top, but still the customarily cool Gus is freaking out over a guy everyone else believes is dead. We all know that Gus’s assumption about Lalo is correct. We’re not used to seeing him this rattled (and this old … sorry but the suspension of disbelief continues to be difficult!), although it’s easy to sympathise with the Chicken Man because we have no clue where Lalo is, either. Four episodes in and we’ve had precisely two scenes featuring the show’s biggest bad guy. His absence is not making the heart grow fonder. It’s making it far more scared. Gus’s belief in Lalo’s continuing existence, and fear over the consequences, is shared by another criminal mastermind – Kim Wexler. Just joking – for now, as Kim hasn’t entirely broken bad just yet. But after sussing that she has been tailed, and confronting her stalkers, she is filled in on the Lalo situation by Mike, who thinks she is the only part of the Wexler McGill partnership who could handle the news without melting down. Melt down she doesn’t, but it seems clear that Kim believes the possibility of Lalo being alive should be taken seriously and, also, that it frightens her. We get that from the 15 seconds we spend with Kim, as she composes herself after Mike’s departure. By the end of the episode, however, she has recovered enough to indulge Jimmy in his little moment of validation-seeking; telling him why his new office is a good choice, and refraining from mentioning Lalo. Kim might well have chosen not to fill Jimmy in on his friend in the cartel because, as Mike observed, he couldn’t handle the truth. Furthermore, she probably chose not to harsh Jimmy’s mellow, as he does his best to make out he’s happy about being known by everyone in Albuquerque’s criminal law circles as the Salamancas’ man. The upside to this is a load of new clients, too many to be catered for in one nail salon. But there is one small downside – everyone at court thinks he is a scumbag. As his nerdy rival, deputy DA Bill Oakley puts it: “You scammed the court … it’s just wrong.” And, while Jimmy might be willing to fall back on some legalistic explanation for why he’s not a guilty party in the conspiracy that saw “Jorge de Guzman” fly the coop, Bill is having none of it. “There’s proving and then there’s knowing,” he says. So, Jimmy’s reputation is burned and Kim has probably guessed as much, given the enthusiasm with which he’s leaning into his new criminal client base. And, all this is happening while the pair are busy stealing cars in order to frame an innocent man as a drug user and consort of sex workers. Kim is a cigarette paper’s width away from Jimmy’s world now and the irony is that it is happening just as she has persuaded Clifford Main that her crusade for justice for the excluded is something worth investing in. Lucky for Kim, then, that she’s as tough as Mike says she is. Rhea Seehorn’s directorial debut is an impressive one. We get moments of intense, almost theatrical emotion from both Kim and Gus, and perfectly played slapstick in the car park of Howard’s therapist. As mentioned, the cold open is odd to the point of eerie, adding another dramatic tone to the mix. Then there are tonnes of clever details too, such as the aerial shot that pans along the courthouse cafeteria before settling on solo diner Jimmy. All in a crisp 43-minute runtime, too. Another Breaking Bad threshold has been crossed as Jimmy has found Saul’s office space. Still, no backdrop of the constitution or floating Statue of Liberty just yet. Just an unplumbed toilet sitting in the middle of the space (perhaps Jimmy takes it out and gold-plates it). “The wicked flee when no man pursueth”: it’s a line made familiar from the pre-season trailer, but one that doesn’t really stand up to scrutiny. Not only was Kim not trying to flee her tails (she confronts them), but bad guys in BCS tend to stand their ground. Gus is a criminal hiding in plain sight and Lalo doesn’t seem at all bothered about the attentions of the criminal justice system. It did, however, set up Kim with a question that’s worth asking, though: are she and Jimmy wicked?",Arts/Television & radio,"Better Call Saul recap: season six, episode four – Kim knows the terrifying truth",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/03/better-call-saul-recap-season-six-episode-four-kim-knows-the-terrifying-truth
5/4/2022,"Britain’s cost of living crisis has another potent symbol: Elsie, a 77-year-old widow who found the cheapest way to keep warm was to switch the heating off, leave home and ride the buses all day using her pensioner’s Freedom Pass. Her story left Boris Johnson once again flailing in the face of everyday hardship. According to the prime minister’s interviewer, the Good Morning Britain TV presenter Susanna Reid, Elsie’s gas and electricity bill had soared from £17 to £85 a month. She was losing weight, having already cut down to just one meal a day, and shopped only in the late afternoons when price-reduced “yellow sticker” items came on sale. Elsie’s was just one of many “choices” that viewers told the programme they have been forced to make as they struggled with static incomes and rising costs, and there was not a lot more to be scrimped and saved. “What else should Elsie cut back on?” Reid asked the prime minister. “I don’t want Elsie to cut back on anything,” replied Johnson. But he had little else to offer Elsie, who already received a warm home discount and did not qualify for a council tax rebate. Johnson boasted he had introduced the Freedom Pass. “So, Elsie should be grateful to you for her bus pass?” asked Reid frostily. The exchange, according to Age UK’s charity director, Caroline Abrahams, showed the government had “no clear answers” for millions of pensioners who struggle when huge price increases overwhelm their fixed incomes. “Not good enough,” she tweeted. Labour called for a windfall tax on energy companies to cut fuel bills. The consumer finance journalist Martin Lewis said Reid’s question powerfully highlighted how he, as a compiler of ingenious cost savings hacks for consumers, had run out of options and political intervention was now needed. “I pray the PM goes back to no 10 & ruminates on Elsie’s plight,” Lewis tweeted. Taking long, cheap rides on night buses around the capital has long been an informal way of young homeless people ensuring they have somewhere to sleep, at least for a couple of hours at a time, but the public transport system is not especially known for offering a mobile living room service for pensioners. Age UK was not aware of anyone else who had used their Freedom Pass like Elsie. But it said it has received “lots” of accounts of pensioners drastically cutting back: turning off the heating, skipping meals or cancelling social activities, or even babysitting for grandchildren. Haydn Watkins, 85, of Burnham Dean in Hampshire, said he was not yet at the point of desperation. “Am I managing? I’m probably halfway along the ‘managing’ spectrum,” he said. “I’m above the poverty line. But there is a sense things are going to get worse.” Watkins has a state pension and a small teaching pension. From this comes an annual council tax bill of nearly £2,000. Electricity bills take more than 10% of his income. He is happy with eating two simple meals a day. But with below-inflation pension increases this year and rising bills in the offing, it was hard to see things getting easier soon. For others, there was little scope for scrimping and saving. Rachel cares for her husband, who is bedbound and has Alzheimer’s, washing and changing him three times a day, with the washer and dryer in constant use. Her fuel bills are currently £270 a month, and because of her husband’s health they cannot be cut. UK pensioner poverty had been falling since the early 2000s, said Christopher Brooks, Age UK’s head of policy, but it has seen a resurgence in recent years. It estimates one in six pensioners are in poverty (equivalent to about 2 million people) and their purchasing power is declining. “There is a need to do something over the next few months to help older people to cope with price rises. We have been calling for a £500 one-off payment, paid to the same cohort of pensioners who received cold weather payments. This would cover most of the short fall in the energy bills this year,” said Brooks.",News/Business,Widow who rides bus to stay warm is tip of pensioner poverty iceberg ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/03/stories-like-elsies-highlight-pensioners-plight-and-the-inadequate-help
5/4/2022,"If the supreme court overturns Roe v Wade, as a leaked draft opinion indicates, it will be a crushing blow to the fundamental right of women in the United States to control their own bodies. It is the grim culmination of a crusade by zealots, against the will of the majority, to risk the health, happiness and lives of women. An accelerating erosion of rights and services has already slashed access to abortions, and many feared that Donald Trump’s judicial legacy would be the curtailment or reversal of the 1973 ruling, which effectively legalised abortion nationally. But this text, obtained by Politico and written by Justice Samuel Alito, looks worse than expected. Excoriating Roe v Wade as “egregiously wrong from the start”, it abandons the issue to states – nearly half of which have, or will soon have, laws banning abortion. Such a decision will force women to give birth in a country with high maternal mortality rates and no national paid maternity leave; it will risk lives as they access illegal abortions; it will threaten to criminalise vulnerable women and those who help them (and even those who have miscarriages); it will push yet more children into poverty. Experts warn that states are likely to pass further restrictions targeting those who travel to obtain abortions, or order medication to manage their abortions at home. These days there are new ways for women to obtain abortions, but also new ways to track them, and those supporting them. Overturning the five-decades-old decision could also help to pave the way for a nationwide abortion ban. Moreover, it throws into doubt other established rights, such as gay marriage, which are similarly rooted in the right to privacy. Though it states that it does not do so – arguing that abortion is a unique issue because it involves the right to life or potential life – that is little reassurance. After all, two of the justices backing this decision were confirmed after describing Roe v Wade as “settled law”. This catastrophic decision, assuming it proceeds, both highlights and solidifies the gulf between different Americas. First, the geographical division between states that ban abortion – home to the majority of women – and those that do not. Second, the socioeconomic and racial divide between those whose wealth and connections will allow them to access abortion, and the rest. Finally, it captures the gulf between American public opinion and the institutions that have been captured by the right because the electoral college, the Senate and supreme court are all skewed in favour of Republicans. A poll in January found that only 30% of voters wanted to see Roe v Wade overturned; 69% were opposed. The move is also strikingly out of step with the rest of the world. With a few exceptions – notably Poland – the trend has been overwhelmingly towards the liberalisation of abortion laws, including in countries such as Chile and Ireland. The UN special rapporteur on the right to health, Dr Tlaleng Mofokeng, has warned that overturning abortion rights would set a dangerous precedent, as well as violate international human rights treaties, including the convention against torture. But this decision, of course, can only be fixed at home. Democrats demand the codification of Roe v Wade, knowing that it would require overturning the filibuster, a Senate procedural rule. Calls for supreme court reform will gain ground, with the introduction of term limits a more straightforward move than expanding the court. Beyond the immediate crisis is the greater challenge of fixing a political system now tilted decisively towards Republicans through the systematic pursuit of power, from gerrymandering to voter suppression to control of elections themselves. The right’s victory is the fruit of an orchestrated campaign over decades; the fightback will demand equal ferocity and commitment. This blow could yet help to create some of the momentum required. November’s midterms will be the first test.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on overturning Roe v Wade: a human rights catastrophe | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/03/the-guardian-view-on-overturning-roe-v-wade-a-human-rights-catastrophe
5/4/2022,"Nowhere in the world has a party commanded a nation longer than Labour in Wales. Barring an upset in local council elections this week, Labour will celebrate a century of dominance come November. The party holds a majority in a third of Welsh councils. The expectation is that this Thursday it will win another 100 seats and take back control of two extra councils. Things looked very different in 2019, when voters turned from Labour to the Conservatives as the “red wall” began to crumble in north Wales. Since then, the mood has soured for the Tories. The cautious approach of the Labour first minister, Mark Drakeford, during the pandemic contrasted with that of the prime minister, Boris Johnson. While these are local Welsh elections, the UK’s national politics is never far from voters’ minds. Labour’s poll ratings are far ahead of the Tories. Brexit captured a nationalist sentiment in Wales – but one that Mr Drakeford has turned to Labour’s advantage. Cardiff University’s Richard Wyn Jones, Jac Larner and Daniel Wincott found that feelings of Welshness had become more intense since 2016, and simultaneously voters rejected any diminution of devolved powers in the name of leaving the EU. In last year’s Senedd elections, anti-devolution parties collapsed without producing an equal-sized increase in vote share for the Tories. Nationalist forces have brought Labour low in England and Scotland. But not in Wales. Independence here is a language movement and Mr Drakeford, like his predecessors, is a fluent Welsh speaker. Labour’s electoral coalition spans both nationalism and unionism. This politics was forged in Labour’s heartland of the south Wales valleys, which have a rich history of workers’ institutes and nonconformist churches. English jostled alongside the Welsh language. Today, this region is where almost three-quarters of the Welsh population lives. Plaid Cymru, which backs independence, appears to have flatlined. The party takes votes from an electorate that feels very Welsh and not at all British. For the Tories, the opposite holds. The signing of a cooperation agreement between Labour and Plaid Cymru in the Senedd last year has already seen a more distinctively Welsh policy programme emerge. ​​Probably the most eye-catching is that some second-home owners could pay four times their current level of council tax from next year to prevent house prices becoming unaffordable for the locals. Mr Drakeford, unlike his Scottish counterpart, lacks control over justice and welfare spending. The Senedd is likely to usurp Westminster’s authority in these areas in the years ahead. It can already vary income taxes. In 1997, Wales voted for devolution by a margin of 50.3%, one of the narrowest victories in British electoral history.

5/4/2022,"A pizza shop owner has been convicted of murdering his wife and burying her body in an unmarked grave that police did not discover for more than six months, despite extensive searches. Nezam Salangy, 44, was found guilty at Worcester crown court of killing 28-year-old Zobaidah Salangy, his wife of eight years, on 28 March 2020 then burying her in woodland near Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, under cover of darkness. Zobaidah’s body was missed by police during an initial search of the area in April 2020 as they failed to dig deep enough, the court heard. As a result of the delay, it was impossible to determine the exact cause of her death, the prosecution said. Salangy’s younger brothers, Mohammed Yasin Salangi, 34, and 31-year-old Mohammed Ramin Salangy, were convicted alongside him of helping to cover up the crime. The younger brother travelled 90 miles by taxi from his and Yasin’s home in Cardiff to help bury the victim. Yasin assisted in the crime by covering up knowledge of the killing and the unmarked burial, proved by telephone evidence. Nezam Salangy later reported his wife missing to police, telling them “she had gone out for a run and never come back”, after leaving him for a “new boyfriend”, prosecutors said. As he left the dock accompanied by security guards, Nezam Salangy stared for several seconds at six West Mercia police detectives who had conducted the investigation, telling them: “You guys framed me”. One of his brothers, as he was led down the stairs to the court cells, said: “That’s the wrong decision.” Shortly after the three men were led downstairs, the court security alarm was triggered. None had chosen to give evidence during the trial. During the six-week trial, the court heard that after Nezam Salangy was arrested on 4 April 2020, he told officers he “was confident his wife was still alive and would return home”. During an initial search of woodland near the Worcestershire village of Lower Bentley, police mistook “a hard layer of soil that they reached to be a natural base below which no one would dig”, prosecuting barrister Simon Denison QC said. They abandoned the search but, “convinced she must be there”, returned to the spot in October 2020 and found Zobaidah’s body bound in curtain wire and wrapped in black bin bags and a duvet cover that matched pillow cases found at the couple’s house in Bromsgrove. The prosecution told jurors that on 27 March, the day before Zobaidah’s disappearance, the couple had “argued bitterly” and that part of the row was video recorded by Nezam Salangy on his phone. In the recording, both said “that their relationship was over”. The prosecuting barrister, Simon Denison QC, said “Zobaidah Salangy vanished off the face of the earth” the next day. Jurors heard Zobaidah had been a maths teacher in Afghanistan and that her November 2012 nuptials to Nezam Salangy, then already living in the UK, had been an arranged marriage. She moved to the UK in October 2013 to live with Nezam Salangy, and was attending English classes at a night school twice a week, intending to either resume maths teaching or become a midwife. Nezam Salangy, Yasin Salangi and Ramin Salangy will be sentenced in June.",News/UK news,Nezam Salangy found guilty of murdering and burying his wife ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/03/nezam-salangy-found-guilty-of-murdering-and-burying-his-wife
5/4/2022,"John Roberts, the US chief justice, has announced an investigation into a leak showing that the supreme court provisionally voted to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade case that legalised abortion nationwide. Publication of the draft opinion by the Politico website on Monday night sparked demonstrations outside America’s highest court, condemnation from Joe Biden and fears that the judiciary has suffered profound damage to its reputation for independence. In a statement on Tuesday, Roberts confirmed the authenticity of the document written in February and said: “To the extent this betrayal of the confidences of the court was intended to undermine the integrity of our operations, it will not succeed.” He added: “I have directed the marshal of the court to launch an investigation into the source of the leak.” Washington was sent into a whirl of speculation over who was responsible for the biggest leak in the modern history of the court – the judicial equivalent of “Deep Throat”, the FBI source that disclosed secrets about the Watergate scandal – and whether they should be considered a leaker or a whistleblower. Some said it was probably a law clerk for one of the court’s liberal justices who wants to put Justice Samuel Alito’s majority opinion in the public domain in the hope that, witnessing the fierce backlash, one of the conservatives on the court might change his or her vote. Others guessed it might be a source on the conservative side wanting the justices to be on record so they will feel locked in and unwilling to change in case they been seen as caving in. A third possible motive was floating the decision early to take the sting out of the final, incendiary announcement expected next month. Edward Fallone, an associate professor at Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, said: “It’s unprecedented. Even those few instances where a law clerk, after leaving the court, wrote a ‘tell-all’ book was viewed as unprecedented then, but for a draft opinion in the midst of the process to come out, I can’t think of any single example.” The source remains a mystery, but Fallone suggested a law clerk is most likely. “They tend to be younger and more passionate. I would assume other staff with access to draft opinions are a little more professional and discreet. But we just don’t know yet.” The investigation announced by Roberts seems likely to scrutinise law clerks for the liberal justices: Stephen Breyer, who retires later this year, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Fallone added: “The suspicion would be that by demonstrating extreme public reaction, they’re trying to perhaps cause one of the conservative majority to have second thoughts. “It’s also possible that it’s one of the law clerks for a conservative justice, that there might be someone who’s wavering – I guess it might be [Brett] Kavanaugh – at the very broad nature of Alito’s opinion. It might be the thought of a conservative law clerk that it will force Kavanaugh to stay in the majority and not look like he’s backtracking.” Kavanaugh told his Senate confirmation hearing that Roe v Wade was “settled as a precedent of the supreme court”. The leak is a particular blow to Roberts who, since becoming chief justice in 2005, has watched in dismay as the court becomes increasingly politicized and suffers an erosion of public trust. It suffered a huge setback when Mitch McConnell, then the Republican majority leader in the Senate, refused to grant a hearing to Barack Obama’s nominee for the court, Merrick Garland. Donald Trump appointed three supreme court justices, with Kavanaugh’s hearings particularly contentious. It recently emerged that Ginni Thomas, the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, had urged Trump’s chief of staff to overturn the 2020 presidential election result. Now comes the political and societal earthquake of Roe v Wade. Scotus Blog, a widely respected law blog, tweeted: “It’s impossible to overstate the earthquake this will cause inside the court, in terms of the destruction of trust among the Justices and staff. This leak is the gravest, most unforgivable sin.” Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, said: “Chief Justice Roberts is probably beside himself. He has no idea how badly this could damage what he cares about most: reputation “Everybody knows that the court depends on public opinion for enforcement. It doesn’t have the purse or the sword and so it must lead in terms of the highest ethical standards and this promises to disrupt that in a period when there’s substantial distrust of the court already.” An opinion poll by Gallup last year showed just 40% of Americans approve of the job the supreme court is doing – the lowest share since the survey began in 2000. A new high of 37% said court is too conservative. Tobias added: “This is a bombshell on top of that. Roberts will do what he can but I don’t know what that would entail.”",News/US news,‘Betrayal’: chief justice orders inquiry into leak of draft abortion ruling,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/03/chief-justice-roberts-abortion-leak-investigation-supreme-court
5/4/2022,"We have been trying to help a mother and her two-year-old under the Ukraine sponsorship scheme for 37 days (Priti Patel faces legal action from Ukrainians stuck in visa backlog, 2 May). The mother is still waiting for a visa, but the child has been granted one. No reason has been given as to why the mother has not been issued a visa to travel with her child. We cannot think of a more foolhardy and stupid way to process applications. There are mothers with children having to live in underground bunkers in Ukraine, short of food and fresh water, with no power, desperately trying to keep their children safe. If you are in this position and your child gets a visa, do you try and get them to safety or do you wait for your visa, knowing you could both be killed any day? The mother and child we are trying to help are friends. Their home was damaged and they sought refuge. The visa delays are adding to their stress and anxiety. The young boy has special needs, so he needs specialist support. His condition is not being helped by the trauma that he has experienced from the war.

The Including Children Affected By Migration (Icam) programme is designed to restore learning relationships and increase learning capacity for the 10.5 million European children affected by migration. It was developed by a partnership of education experts from the UK, Italy, Spain and Romania, which has moved quickly in the last two months to develop guidance and free resources for European schools welcoming Ukranian child refugees (accessible on the icamproject.eu website). As more schools welcome Ukrainian children and young people now and in future months, the Icam programme will complement the work of charities such as Schools for Sanctuary by providing the framework and resources for developing a whole-school approach to making this transition as smooth as possible.Bob BasleyNational facilitator, Icam  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

5/4/2022,"Some energy suppliers have been hiking customers’ direct debit payments by more than is necessary and must explain themselves within three weeks or face punishment, the government has announced. The comments from the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, follow reports that soaring energy costs have led to some customers receiving demands that double or even triple their monthly payments. On 1 April, the regulator Ofgem’s energy price cap rose by 54% – or almost £700 – to £1,971 a year, with prices expected to go up again later this year. A fortnight later, Ofgem’s chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said it was seeing “troubling signs” that some companies were allowing customer service levels to deteriorate, with concerns raised that some “may have been increasing direct debit payments by more than is necessary, or directing customers to tariffs that may not be in their best interest”. He said the regulator was commissioning a series of “market compliance reviews” which would include “stricter supervision of how direct debits are handled” by suppliers. On Tuesday Kwarteng indicated companies had been found to be acting inappropriately. He tweeted: “Some energy suppliers have been increasing direct debits beyond what is required. I can confirm @Ofgem has today issued compliance reviews. Suppliers have three weeks to respond.” He added: “The regulator will not hesitate to swiftly enforce compliance, including issuing substantial fines.” In March the consumer expert Martin Lewis told MPs that some energy companies were using unfair and potentially illegal tactics to secure cash at the expense of their customers. Lewis said some of the increases in direct debits may represent breaches of energy companies’ licence conditions. “A number of companies are doing it to improve their own cashflow position at the expense of their customers,” he added. Ofgem recently set out proposals to tackle the misuse of customer credit balances. Last month Brearley said some suppliers had been using this cash “to prop up their finances, enabling them to follow more risky business models”. He added: “Customer credit balances should only be used to reconcile bills, not as a source of risk-free capital.” On 1 April, energy suppliers were allowed to increase their variable gas and electricity tariffs to the new maximum. Almost all households are now on these capped gas and electricity tariffs – about 22 million in total.",Lifestyle/Money,"Energy firms have three weeks to justify direct debit hikes, Kwarteng warns",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/03/energy-firms-have-three-weeks-to-justify-direct-debit-hikes-kwarteng-warns
