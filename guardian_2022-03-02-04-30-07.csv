3/2/2022,"The piercing screams of children mingled with the barking of traumatised dogs and the shouts of soldiers desperately trying to maintain order, as the 14.07 to Ivano-Frankivsk pulled into Kyiv’s central station. There was a crowd of thousands on platform one, surging towards the blue carriages and desperate to secure a prized place on a ride westwards out of the Ukrainian capital. Most people would not be able to board. “Look at these faces around us, they are exactly the same as in the photographs from the second world war, and it’s just five days. Can you imagine what will happen in a month?” asked Tanya Novgorodskaya, 48, an art historian who arrived at the station on Tuesday afternoon with her 15-year-old daughter. She had bought tickets for six different trains, but soon realised they counted for nothing. Instead, there was a boarding algorithm: first mothers with children, then women, then old people. Others were kept away by the police and soldiers standing guard. Quickly, the train was crammed full. Families had to make split-second decisions, as mothers and children were allowed to board but grandparents told to wait behind. This was the sixth day of Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine, and by now fear had taken over. In the first days, there was a sense of shock and disbelief. Then came pride and inspiration, at the surprisingly resilient Ukrainian response and the unity of Ukrainian society. But the success at repelling the initial Russian assault comes with a terrifying caveat. With Putin’s plan A failing, will his plan B involve turning Kyiv into Aleppo or Grozny? The missile strike on a residential block in Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv on Monday, followed by another strike that hit the city’s central square on Tuesday morning, led many in Kyiv to realise what the capital could be up against in just a few days. On Tuesday there was another reminder of the sheer power that Ukraine is up against, when a missile strike hit Kyiv’s television tower, reportedly killing at least five people. The tower is close to the memorial site that commemorates the victims of Babyn Yar, the ravine where Nazi soldiers massacred up to 150,000 people during the second world war – including more than 30,000 Jews. The Russian defence ministry warned residents of the capital to flee, promising airstrikes against an array of targets. Like many, Novgorodskaya had underestimated the ferocity and barbarity of the oncoming invasion, and ignored those who told her she should leave. Even when the missiles started falling, she decided to stay and tough it out. On Tuesday, though, she changed her mind, having seen footage of the missile attacks on civilian areas of Kharkiv. “We realised it might be the last chance to get out. Personally, I would stay and try to fight, but I think if you have children, you should leave,” she said. She and her daughter had taken only a small grey hand luggage case between them, for a trip that could end up being indefinite. She hoped that, by evening, they might be able to force their way on to a train. The crush to board the 14.07 was too intense for many to even attempt, and as pleading wails emanated from the scrums around each carriage door, a middle-aged couple stood nervously some metres back, carrying a suitcase and a five-litre bottle of water, their brown boxer dog standing alongside them, panting nervously. The man, Yuri, said his children lived in Munich and had been pleading with him for weeks to leave Ukraine, but like most people here, he had simply not believed Putin was capable of launching the kind of war that is now under way. On the first night of the assault, he and his wife slept in the basement of their apartment block. It was icily cold, structurally insecure and there was no toilet. Since then, they had been sleeping in the bathroom of their ninth floor apartment and hoping for the best. When they saw images of the missile attacks on Kharkiv on Monday, they made the decision to flee. “I am scared for what’s coming and I really want to get out of here,” he said. But Yuri and his wife were far too low down the priority list, and far too polite, to have any chance of boarding the train. His wife tried to make the case that he had high blood pressure and had passed out the previous day, but he shushed her out of embarrassment, and nobody was listening anyway. Finally, with a grinding of wheels and a hiss of smoke, the train pulled out of the station, a huddle of humans visible through the grimy windows and the faces of small children squashed against the glass. On arrival in western Ukraine, many will have a further gruelling journey to get to the border with Poland, Slovakia or Hungary, where people have reported waiting times of several days this week. Yuri and his wife were left behind on the platform along with thousands of others, hoping they might be luckier next time. An elderly man with an amputated leg stumbled on crutches, as his wife tried to rouse his spirits to wait another few hours and try for a spot on the next train west. A young couple hugged each other in support, both of them crying. A woman leaned against a pillar, dejected, tears falling on the cat she was cradling in her arms. Adebayo Babatunde, a Nigerian management student who has been studying in Kyiv for the past six months, appeared to have little chance of being allowed to board, and no real idea of where he might go if he did. He was speaking to his sister, a British citizen who lives in London, via WhatsApp. He had applied for a UK visa in Ukraine weeks ago, she said, but had no response, and she could not get through to the Home Office or the British embassy. “Please help my brother to get on a train,” implored the voice coming from the phone. The train station is one of the few hubs of activity in Kyiv, which a week ago was a fully functioning, lively European capital city, but is now a ghost town. Khreshchatyk, the city’s broad central thoroughfare, was almost completely deserted on Tuesday. Most shops are closed, with the only signs of life the queues outside pharmacies. On the edge of the city, more and more checkpoints spring up each day. On Tuesday, army cranes were lifting concrete blocks into the road to form barricades in several locations. The main checkpoints are manned by professional soldiers, while hundreds of minor posts are guarded by nervy volunteers, many of whom have never handled weapons before. Digital billboards on the outskirts of town announce: “Putin has lost! The whole world is with Ukraine,” while the information tableaux at the side of the highway announce: “Air temperature +1, road temperature +2, Russians, fuck off!” The threat from the Russian defence ministry appeared to justify the fears of Yuri, voiced on the platform earlier in the day as he explained his decision to leave. “It was hard to believe Russia could strike Kharkiv, but now it’s clear what the plan is. They’re going to do here what they did in Chechnya.”",News/World news,‘It might be the last chance to get out’: citizens flee Kyiv as assault intensifies,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/it-might-be-the-last-chance-to-get-out-citizens-flee-kyiv-as-assault-intensifies
3/2/2022,"Russia is “uninvestable for the foreseeable future”, said Stephen Bird, chief executive of Abrdn, a statement of the obvious for a fund management group. If BP and Shell can ditch long-held investments and partnerships, Abrdn can certainly wave goodbye to the 0.5% of its assets that it currently holds in Russia. The money is the customers’ anyway. The moral clarity around the moves by BP and Shell owed much, of course, to the fact that the duo were in bed in state-backed energy companies that are arms of the Kremlin – Rosneft and Gazprom respectively. The position of Centrica, owner of British Gas, now commendably trying to extricate itself “as a matter of urgency” from gas supply agreements with Gazprom, is different. The company wasn’t compelled to do anything, but is choosing to do so. An open question, then, is how far the disinvestment principle should be pushed. Note that Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, did not distinguish between trade with Russian state-backed firms and general trade in Russia when he said on Twitter that “there is now a strong moral imperative on British companies to isolate Russia”. On that basis, he applauded Jaguar Land Rover as it followed Swedish group Volvo in halting vehicle deliveries to Russia. To pick on spirits group Diageo, its last annual report trumpeted a sales increase in eastern Europe “mainly driven by strong growth in Russia”. Should Diageo be in the business today of selling premium bottles of Johnnie Walker whisky to wealthy Russian consumers, and paying local duties to the Russian government in the process? Well, like JLR, it has paused exports, but the approach does not yet sound like a fixed policy. To be clear, non-supply of consumer inessentials is a long way down the list of voluntary sanctions that western business could adopt, or would hurt the Russian economy. And a collapsing rouble, plus the increased freight costs, may make debate redundant anyway. But shareholders and western consumers alike will expect thought-out positions sooner rather than later. Symbolism also matters. Almost everyone claims to have ESG (environmental, social and governance) principles these days; we need to know what they mean in practice. A glance at the 2021 numbers from Flutter, owner of Paddy Power and Betfair, might tempt one to cast cynicism aside and conclude that the gambling industry’s vows to clean up its act are getting somewhere. Safer gambling measures were estimated to have cost “in excess of £90m” in revenues last year, said Flutter, warning shareholders that “improvements we have made, and will continue to make, will impact near term growth”. Revenue from customers in the “higher value band” – the category where problem gambling is concentrated – has halved since 2019. These days the company tries to emphasise its focus on “recreational” customers, judging (surely correctly) that that is a better place to be in the long term. Investors seemed surprised. Flutter’s stiffer “play well” policies weren’t the only reason for a subdued outlook for UK growth this year (the lockdown boom in online gambling is also clearly over), but they were a factor. Flutter’s shares fell 12%, despite the group’s adventure in the liberalising US market proceeding to plan. For a wider picture on the industry’s self-reform approach, though, look at the other tale from the UK gambling sector on Tuesday: 888’s thumping £9.4m fine, the third highest from the Gambling Commission, for failings that can only be viewed as basic and glaring. In one case, 888 placed a deposit cap of £1,300 a month on the account of an NHS worker who was known to the operator to be earning £1,400 a month. In another, a customer lost £37,000 in six weeks before 888 carried out common sense affordability checks. Itai Pazner, chief executive of 888, expressed “regret” that “previous implementation of our processes failed to meet required standards in the UK” but the failures cannot be viewed as ancient history. This happened in 2020, a time when the regulator had warned the industry about heightened risks during Covid. And 888 is supposed to be a serious company: it has been allowed to buy William Hill. For MPs, who will soon be considering a government white paper on gambling reform, the moral ought to be clear: corporate expressions of good intentions are no substitute for strong and clear regulation.",News/Business,"Regarding Russia, UK companies are going to need thought-out positions",https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/01/regarding-russia-uk-companies-are-going-to-need-thought-out-positions
3/2/2022,"Ukraine’s World Cup play-off against Scotland could be deferred as football’s authorities try to ensure the country has a chance to qualify for Qatar 2022. In a further change prompted by the invasion of Ukraine, Poland are expected to be confirmed as having a bye into a play-off final after Russia’s ban from international football was enforced on Monday. Scotland are due to host Ukraine in Glasgow on 24 March in their play-off semi-final but there is uncertainty over whether Ukraine will be able to field a side, with the majority of their squad in their home country where they play their club football. The Ukrainian league has been suspended until further notice. The Scottish Football Association wrote to its Ukrainian counterpart this week offering support and is willing to accommodate any arrangement that would allow the match to take place. A formal proposal to delay the fixture has not been made and it is understood by all sides that any postponement would not guarantee the match takes place. A decision on whether the fixture can go ahead on the scheduled date must be made by the end of this week. A statement from the SFA said: “The Scottish FA president, Rod Petrie, has written to his counterpart at the Ukrainian Association of Football to send a message of support, friendship and unity. Football is inconsequential amid conflict, but we have conveyed the strong sense of solidarity communicated to us by Scotland fans and citizens in recent days. “We remain in dialogue with Uefa and Fifa regarding our men’s Fifa World Cup play-off and women’s World Cup qualifier and have offered to support our Ukrainian colleagues’ preparations as best we can in these unimaginably difficult circumstances.” Confirmation that Poland will progress, to play Sweden or the Czech Republic on 29 March, is expected. The Guardian understands that no alternative mechanism, such as drafting in Hungary or Finland, who narrowly missed out on qualification, is being considered. Poland took a public stand against Fifa when they called for Russia, their play-off opponents, to be banned. They were yet to receive direct communication from the governing body on Tuesday.

3/2/2022,"The nine handicaps at the Cheltenham Festival later this month may offer some hope for British stables to recover their shattered pride, after Martin Greenwood, Britain’s senior jumps handicapper, said on Tuesday that his team is doing what it can to ensure that the home team’s horses arrive at the meeting on competitive marks. Irish-trained runners finished 7-2 in front in the Festival’s handicaps last year, when Ireland had a record breaking 23 winners in all from 28 races, despite fielding only a third of the runners in what are, in theory at least, the meeting’s most competitive events. The three previous seasons saw a 5-5 draw in the handicaps – one was dropped from the programme in 2021 – and a similar return at this year’s Festival, which opens on 15 March, would be a significant step forward. Some of the British-trained runners at least may be aided by some tweaks to the handicapping system, which will see some Irish novices given a little more to carry than might have been the case in the past, and some older British-trained horses dropping down the weights more rapidly than before. “It’s not necessarily pull the UK down and shove the Irish up,” Greenwood said, “because we’ve always taken a higher view of the Irish novices anyway. It’s not concentrated on Cheltenham or Aintree, it’s an organic thing that we’re trying to do over the year. “We’ve got a lot of statistical evidence with a new IT set up, and we noticed a bulge in the 130/140 [rating] area compared to 10 years ago. We decided to try and remove it a bit and bring it back to where it was by dropping the older, more exposed horses a bit quicker.

Whether that was just a blip, two weeks’ time will tell us more.” Perhaps the most interesting snippet at a press conference as the weights for this year’s Festival handicaps were published on Tuesday arrived via a phone link to Gordon Elliott’s stable in Ireland.

3/2/2022,"An insecticide banned due to its harm to bees will be used on sugar beet in Britain this year after ministers authorised an emergency exemption. The government overruled its own scientific advisers and the decision was called “scandalous” by campaigners. The neonicotinoid, called thiamethoxam, was banned in 2018 across Europe after a series of studies found it damaged bees. But British Sugar applied for an emergency exemption and on Tuesday the conditions for the exemption were met. A national forecast of the proportion of the crop expected to suffer from virus yellows, a disease spread by aphids, predicted a level of 69%, far above the 19% threshold that had been set. The exemption was also granted in 2021 but was not implemented as the forecast for virus yellows turned out to be low. In 2020, according to the government, the virus cut the national yield of sugar beet by a quarter. “The approval to use this bee-killing pesticide is scandalous,” said Craig Bennett, chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts. “The government has outlined ambitions to restore nature and reverse declines of precious wildlife. But at the same time it is giving a green light to use a highly toxic chemical that could harm pollinating insects and pollute soils and rivers.” “We need to restore the natural world and gradually wean ourselves off using chemicals in agriculture,” he said. “It’s time the government listened to their own experts who have said they cannot support the use of this pesticide as it’s simply too dangerous.” The Wildlife Trusts also said the virus yellows forecast had been wrong in the past. Matt Shardlow, head of the charity Buglife, said: “It is distressing that rivers and flowers in eastern England this summer will be polluted with toxic insecticides, to the massive detriment of bees, mayflies and many other animals. Neonicotinoids are rightly banned and these approvals, against all expert advice, must stop.” A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “The decision to approve an emergency authorisation was not taken lightly and was based on robust scientific assessment. We evaluate the risks very carefully and only grant temporary emergency authorisations for restricted pesticides in special circumstances when strict requirements are met and there are no alternatives.” The British Beet Research Organisation said: “All sugar beet growers must adhere to the robust stewardship programme that has been agreed by the Health and Safety Executive.” It said flowering crops which would attract pollinators could not be grown in fields treated with the pesticide for 32 months after application. In January, when the exemption was granted in principle, the environment secretary, George Eustice, wrote: “The dose level at which no negative impacts on bees occur is unknown. For this reason, it was not possible to rule out completely a degree of risk to bees (and this is the case even with a 32-month exclusion) from flowering plants in or near the field in the years after neonicotinoid use.” About two-thirds of the UK’s sugar comes from homegrown sugar beet. Twelve EU countries including France, Belgium, Denmark and Spain have given emergency authorisations for neonicotinoid use in the last three years. In 2017, Michael Gove, then the environment secretary, said: “The weight of evidence now shows the risks neonicotinoids pose to our environment, particularly to the bees and other pollinators which play such a key part in our £100bn food industry. We cannot afford to put our pollinator populations at risk.” The scientists behind a volume of studies published in 2021 said that insect populations globally are suffering “death by a thousand cuts”, in part due to pesticides, and that many were falling at “frightening” rates that were “tearing apart the tapestry of life”. Virtually all farms could significantly cut their pesticide use while still producing as much food, according to a 2017 study.",News/Environment,UK overrules scientific advice by lifting ban on bee-harming pesticide ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/01/bee-harming-pesticide-thiamethoxam-uk-emergency-exemption
3/2/2022,"British firms are scrambling to dump Russian assets amid efforts by the US, EU and UK governments to deepen Moscow’s economic isolation following the invasion of Ukraine. Legal & General, Abrdn and state-run pension scheme Nest have said they will try to sell their holdings in Russian stocks, while British Gas owner Centrica on Tuesday became the third big British energy firm to cut ties with Russia within a week, echoing BP and Shell by announcing the end of its gas supply agreement with Kremlin-controlled Gazprom. Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), the UK’s biggest asset manager with £1.3 trillion in assets under management, said it had already cut its exposure to Russian shares and bonds. It will also seek to sell its positions in sanctioned Russian companies “if and when market conditions allow” with the Moscow stock exchange closed. Turmoil is expected when Russian assets eventually trade again, as investors dump shares that could be hit by further sanctions. Future earnings of Russian companies are also likely to fall with some economists predicting Russia’s economy will collapse under the pressure. Gazprom supplies gas to Centrica, which it then sells to British households. Chris O’Shea, the Centrica chief executive, said: “We are shocked by the events unfolding in Ukraine and the needless loss of lives. “We intend to exit our gas supply agreements with Russian counterparts, principally Gazprom, as a matter of urgency.” Nest, the £23bn state-run pension scheme, said it would “be removing all our investment in Russian government bonds and Russian companies as soon as possible.” Helen Dean, Nest’s chief executive, said it was making the move “in view of the situation in Ukraine”. Abrdn, which manages £542bn in assets, and the Universities Superannuation Scheme, the UK’s biggest independent pension scheme at £90bn, both also said they would reduce their investments in the country earlier on Tuesday. The managers of telecoms company BT’s pension scheme said exposure to Russia was already minimal because of “governance concerns and ownership rights associated with the region”. It has been cutting it back further “since the beginning of the year”, a spokeswoman said in a statement. It holds only £30m in Russian securities, compared to £192m in December. It is understood that BP’s pension scheme is also looking to cut its exposure. LGIM said in a statement: “The invasion of Ukraine contravenes almost every measurable environmental, social and governance (ESG) metric. LGIM has already where possible, reduced our clients’ exposure to Russian securities.” “These are exceptional times for investors,” the company said. “This is a challenging situation for all boards with exposure to Russia.” Simon Pilcher, the head of the USS, said it had sold off about half of its roughly £450m in investments connected to Russia in the last few weeks. “We think there is a clear financial as well as a moral case for divestment with respect to our Russian holdings,” said Pilcher, speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “Morals drive finance and if you are a financial investor and you don’t think about the moral impacts of what you are doing you are both shortsighted and, dare I say it, immoral.” Investment managers have a financial incentive to sell Russian-linked assets because it could hit their returns on investment. “We will not invest in Russia and Belarus for the foreseeable future,” said Abrdn chief executive Stephen Bird, according to Reuters. “We have acted to reduce our holdings in Russia and Belarus.” Some other investors have already taken action. Last week, the Church of England announced it had sold all £20m of investments in Russian companies in response to what the archbishops of Canterbury and York described as Vladimir Putin’s “act of evil” in Ukraine. The Local Government Pension Scheme advisory board has told its members, the schemes for councils around Britain, to examine their portfolios for links to Russia. USS’s Pilcher said that his team at USS, which has about 500,000 pension customers, had found it extremely difficult to find buyers for its Russian assets as the country and its institutions had become toxic for traders since the invasion. “In the current environment there is very little trading,” he said. “It is exceptionally difficult to get a price on anything. We have halved our equity investments relating to Russia in the last several weeks.” On Monday, KLP, Norway’s largest pension fund, said it would sell off its 500m Norwegian kroner (£42m) of investments in 22 Russian firms including the energy companies Gazprom and Rosneft and the banks VTB and Sberbank. The Norwegian government has also announced that its $1.3tn (£970bn) sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, would divest from Russia.

3/2/2022,"Liz Truss is facing mounting questions over why the Foreign Office will take “weeks and months” to sanction Russian oligarchs, with the UK lagging behind the US and EU after targeting just eight individuals with links to Vladmir Putin. The Foreign Office has for days been promising to target a “hit list” of oligarchs but refuses to say when the names will be ready, despite warnings from MPs that billionaires will already be taking their assets out of the country. Senior Tory MPs are growing increasingly frustrated by what they see as a lack of preparation on the part of the Foreign Office, with some having warned Truss months ago that the UK should be ready with a response against London-based oligarchs with links to Putin if Russia were to invade. Labour also raised concern about “asset flight” by oligarchs who fear they may be hit by sanctions soon and worries that the UK is “off the pace” compared with the US and EU. Priti Patel, the home secretary, claimed on Tuesday there were “legal reasons” for the time being taken, with officials trying to make sure sanctions are watertight against legal challenge. Cabinet sources insisted the UK had been going further on hitting banks and financial operations with sanctions than other countries, with more than 120 entities targeted to date. Asked whether more oligarchs would be blacklisted this week, a Foreign Office source said on Tuesday: “We will be sanctioning more oligarchs over the coming weeks and months.” But David Davis, the Tory former Brexit secretary, said the financial industry sanctions “were not going to hit Putin where it hurts most”. “We need to target many more of his allies and facilitators that have frankly bought their way into British society and that’s what’s really missing,” Davis said. “We need to target those owning businesses on our stock exchange. “We need to target those owning London homes that we can no longer afford because of Russian operations in London. We need to target oligarchs who own football clubs that many of our citizens can no longer afford to attend.” He added: “I do worry about the government moving so slowly that its prey escapes it.” In the House of Commons, Davis named Roman Abramovich, the Russian billionaire with property in London, saying “according to the Spanish national intelligence committee, he is one of the men who manages Putin’s business affairs. That is a really important issue about whether he should be on our target list”. Abramovich, the Russian billionaire who recently passed stewardship of Chelsea FC to a charitable foundation, has vehemently disputed reportsalleging he is close to Putin or that he has done anything to merit sanctions. Bob Seely, a Tory MP and member of the foreign affairs committee, said oligarchs needed to be under the spotlight as they were “not just obscenely rich people who are mates with someone” but part of the Kremlin’s “structure of control and power whether it is in east Ukraine or in the UK”. The EU announced a list of sanctions against Russian businessmen on Monday night, including billionaires Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven. They have vowed to contest the restrictions. Fridman is a Ukrainian-born energy tycoon who owns AlfaBank with his partners, including Aven. He bought and still owns Athlone House in Highgate, north London, for £65m in cash in 2016, according to the Land Registry. The billionaire, who is one of Russia’s richest men, controls private equity firm LetterOne, which owns Holland & Barrett. In a letter to his employees this week, he called for an end to the “bloodshed” in Ukraine and stated that “war can never be the answer”, without directly criticising Putin. Others to be sanctioned by the EU, but not the UK, include Alexei Mordashov, a major shareholder in TUI, the London-listed travel company. Alisher Usmanov, who has sponsorship links to Everton, also had his assets frozen as part of sanctions imposed by the European Union in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Uzbekistan-born billionaire’s USM Holdings sponsors Everton’s training ground, with an initial five-year deal announced in 2017. Another Russian oligarch not sanctioned by the UK is Oleg Deripaska, who has been on the US sanctions list since 2018 over his alleged links to the Russian government, which he has taken legal action to challenge. This week, Deripaska called for peace talks to begin “as fast as possible” in a post on the messaging app Telegram. “Peace is very important,” wrote Deripaska, who founded the Russian aluminium giant Rusal, in which he still owns a stake through shares in its London-listed parent company EN+ Group. The British government strongly defended the sanctions it has already put in place. The Foreign Office source added: “Liz has been clear we have a hit list and we’ll be working our way through that as part of a rolling package. Nothing – and no one – is off the table.” Robert Jenrick, another former Tory cabinet minister, also argued that the most important sanctions were those that have a “systemic impact on the Russian economy”. He said parliament “should not be going down the rabbit hole of interest in individuals and oligarchs – important though that is – as that is not going to make a material difference in the short term”. He added that many of those business people left Russia many years ago and are not currently close to Putin.",News/World news,Questions raised over time-lag on UK moves to sanction oligarchs,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/questions-raised-over-time-lag-on-uk-moves-to-sanction-oligarchs
3/2/2022,"Vladimir Putin is not only piling body on body in Ukraine. He is also piling crime upon crime. His unprovoked and illegal invasion of a democratic state has already caused substantial civilian casualties, as well as the deaths of Russian soldiers. The failure to achieve the swift victory he anticipated is increasing its cruelty. The office of the UN high commissioner for human rights said on Tuesday morning that it had recorded 136 civilian deaths, including 13 children, and 400 injured, but believed the true toll to be much higher; it grew in the hours following that announcement. Human rights groups report the use of cluster bombs – banned by many countries – which hit a preschool and close to a hospital. In Kharkiv, missiles struck the regional government building in Freedom Square, rained down upon homes and killed people fleeing or seeking food and water. Thermobaric weapons, so powerful they can vaporise bodies, have been photographed in Ukraine, and its ambassador to the US says Russia has already used them. On Tuesday afternoon, Russia’s defence ministry told Kyiv residents to leave their homes, an acknowledgment that the “precision strikes” they were announcing against security service targets would be nothing of the kind. The city’s television tower has been attacked (with a bomb in Mr Putin’s “denazification” offensive striking the neighbouring Holocaust memorial site at Babyn Yar, where German invaders massacred 34,000 Jews in the second world war). A disinformation drive is under way, designed to induce panic. A 40-mile long convoy of troops is making its way towards the capital. The brutality of Russian tactics has been documented from Grozny (the “most destroyed city on Earth”) to Aleppo. Already in Ukraine we are witnessing “serial criminalities”, believes the human rights lawyer Philippe Sands. Mr Putin’s initial crime of aggression is clear. The prosecutor of the international criminal court in The Hague announced on Monday that he would launch an investigation into possible war crimes or crimes against humanity; Ukraine is not a member of the ICC, but has awarded it jurisdiction. However distant the prospects of justice are, it must be pursued. The war that Mr Putin is waging now looks likely to become far more horrific. Despite that horror, and while hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing, many ordinary people have resolved to stand and fight, and unarmed civilians are still confronting and challenging Russian troops. Given this asymmetry, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged the west to consider imposing a no-fly zone in addition to supplying arms. The US, UK and others have made it clear they will not. No-fly zones have saved lives in the past. But they have done so in utterly different circumstances. The danger of western forces firing at the aircraft of a ruthless and rattled man who has already made nuclear threats is both obvious and immense: a conflagration on a far greater scale, with a much higher death toll. The Russian president is already escalating his ruthless assault. It is increasingly hard to see how he would feel able to extract his country from this war with anything short of Ukraine becoming a vassal state. An isolated and dangerous man has no exit, does not want to be shown one, and risks losing everything. Though the initial slowness of the offensive has set back Mr Putin’s plans to end Ukrainian independence, this does not reduce the danger to Ukrainian civilians, but increases it.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Vladimir Putin’s crimes: Ukraine’s growing tragedy | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/01/the-guardian-view-on-vladimir-putins-crimes-ukraines-growing-tragedy
3/2/2022,"As the latest barrage of Russian missiles rained on Kyiv on Tuesday, Finnish MPs debated new calls for a referendum on Nato membership. Along with Sweden – also militarily non-aligned – Finland is sending anti-tank missiles and other defence equipment to assist Ukraine, as it attempts to survive Russia’s brutal onslaught. The Swedes have undertaken no equivalent action since giving weapons to Finland during the Winter war with the Soviet Union in 1939. As European nations contemplate the scale of Vladimir Putin’s revanchist ambitions, and the lengths to which he is prepared to go to fulfil them, decades-old security assumptions are being redrawn and rethought in the space of days. A strategic journey without maps is being undertaken at hair-raising speed. Nowhere are the gears being moved through faster than in Germany. At the weekend, its Social Democrat chancellor, Olaf Scholz, abandoned longstanding precepts of German foreign policy, taking Europe’s wealthiest and most powerful country on to new terrain. Faced with Mr Putin’s invasion, Mr Scholz unexpectedly rejected the postwar taboo on sending lethal weapons to conflict zones, announcing that stinger missiles and other equipment would be sent to Ukraine. In an extraordinary Sunday session of the Bundestag, he announced that a fund of €100bn (£85bn) would be immediately set up to boost the strength of Germany’s armed forces. This will be supplemented by a sustained increase in the country’s defence spending in the years to come. These measures followed last week’s decision to halt the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project – which would double the flow of Russian gas direct to Germany – and robust support for unprecedented sanctions intended to collapse the Russian economy. For Germany, this constitutes a foreign policy pivot of huge magnitude. Shadowed by its 20th-century history, postwar Germany has adopted a low military profile and sought to promote economic interdependence as the route to geopolitical stability. Since the days of Mr Scholz’s Social Democrat predecessor, Willy Brandt, German ostpolitik has mostly pursued a strategy of engagement with Moscow. But Mr Putin’s unprovoked invasion, making a mockery of diplomatic efforts by Mr Scholz and his Green foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, has buried that approach for the foreseeable future. Ending German energy dependency on Russian gas, and accelerating the green transition, has become a matter of national security. A more militarily assertive Germany, alongside France, seems likely to sit at the heart of a European security architecture which is itself undergoing transformation. On Sunday, in what was described as a “watershed moment”, the EU ignored treaty prohibitions on funding military operations. The new off-budget European Peace Facility instrument will offer €500m worth of military assistance to Ukraine, and will have a ceiling of €5bn. “Another taboo has fallen,” observed the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, approvingly. Further EU expansion to the east, a moribund subject for years, appears to be speculatively back on the table, including Ukraine. Mr Putin’s folly has been to generate through murderous aggression the circumstances he most feared: a Europe united in solidarity with Kyiv and joined in implacable hostility towards his rogue regime. The stakes, as a pariah Kremlin tosses threats towards Finland and Sweden over Nato, and advertises Russia’s nuclear capabilities, are frighteningly high and they are rising day by day.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Europe versus Putin: a strategic journey without maps | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/01/the-guardian-view-on-europe-versus-putin-a-strategic-journey-without-maps
3/2/2022,"Mandatory Covid-19 jabs for health and social care workers in England will be scrapped on 15 March, Sajid Javid has said, as he confirmed staff will no longer be required by law to get vaccinated. The rules came into force for care home staff in November, and had been due to be introduced for frontline NHS and wider social care staff in regulated settings from 1 April. The policy met fierce resistance from some workers, with warnings that sacking those who did not comply would worsen the already serious staffing crisis engulfing health and care services. Several MPs had also criticised the decision. Javid, the health secretary, said earlier this year that he believed it was “no longer proportionate” to require vaccination as a condition of deployment under law. On Tuesday he confirmed the regulations in health and social care would be revoked, and said the rules would end on 15 March. The development immediately raised the question of whether care workers who may have left their jobs could return. Martin Green, the chief executive of Care England, said Javid’s announcement had come too late to repair the “huge” damage done to the care sector. “Staff have already left residential care services and found new jobs in the NHS and home care,” he told the Guardian. “I seriously doubt we are going to see lots of them coming back.” Javid said that when the original decision was taken to make it a legal requirement, Delta was the dominant variant of the virus but that had since been replaced by the less severe Omicron. However, he added that despite the change, he still considers it “a professional responsibility for health and care staff, and others who work in the health and social care sectors, to be vaccinated”. The government said 90% of responses to a public consultation launched last month supported the removal of the legal requirement. The consultation received more than 90,000 responses from across the health and social care sector, as well as from members of the public, Javid told MPs. He said 92% of the NHS workforce and 95% of care home staff had received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, and 89% of home or domiciliary care staff had so far taken at least one dose. He added that the government was “committed to working with the health and social care sectors to engage with those who are yet to make the positive choice to be vaccinated”. The Guardian understands ministers are working closely with the medical royal colleges and health professional regulators to strengthen guidance on the prevention and control of infections. The decision was welcomed by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), while Unison said many staff who left care homes due to the requirement were unlikely to return to their jobs. The RCN general secretary and chief executive, Pat Cullen, said the change was the “right decision”, adding: “Holding the threat of losing their jobs over the heads of the small minority of staff who had not been vaccinated was the wrong approach and this decision will be welcomed by those whose jobs were at risk.” But she said it had come “too late for those who have already lost their jobs”. She added: “Ministers must now urgently address the health and social care workforce crisis which is undermining nursing staff’s ability to care safely for their patients. There are tens of thousands of nursing vacancies across those services.” Gavin Edwards, the head of care at Unison, said: “There were always better ways of upping the jab rate in care. Making the vaccine mandatory meant thousands of experienced staff quit care homes. These were workers the struggling sector could ill afford to lose. “Many won’t go back either. They have found better paid, less stressful work elsewhere. Ministers could go some way towards making up for the distress caused by ensuring every care worker is paid at least the real living wage. That would begin to solve the current staffing crisis.”",News/Politics,Mandatory Covid jabs dropped for NHS staff in England from mid-March,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/01/mandatory-covid-jabs-dropped-nhs-staff-england-march-health-social-care-workers-law-vaccinated-sajid-javid
3/2/2022,"MPs will get a £2,200 pay rise from next month, the parliamentary spending watchdog has announced, sparking a backlash given the change will coincide with the national insurance hike and a growing “cost of living crisis”. The 2.7% increase in MPs’ salaries is nearly half the current rate of inflation, effectively meaning they will get a real-terms pay cut, but comes against a backdrop of significant economic hardship for many and the Bank of England urging workers not to ask for sizeable pay rises to try to stop prices spiralling out of control. Downing Street has said previously Boris Johnson is against MPs getting higher wages, while the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, went further and argued the move should not go ahead. Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, also said a lot of people would be “understandably angry” at the decision, “particularly when families are facing a cost-of-living crisis”, adding: “MPs don’t need a pay rise just as workers across the country don’t need a tax rise.” However, MPs’ pay is set independently of both the government and parliament. The issue is now decided by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), which was set up in the wake of the 2009 expenses scandal. The rise was awarded due to the amount of work MPs do, which “dramatically increased last year”, said Richard Lloyd, chair of Ipsa. He said: “This is the first increase in pay for MPs in two years and follows the average of increases across the public sector last year. “MPs play a vital role in our democracy and this is reflected in their pay. It is right that MPs are paid fairly for the responsibility and the unseen work they do helping their constituents. “For parliament to reflect society, it is vital that people from all walks of life can be an MP.” Zara Sultana, the Labour MP for Coventry South, said the regulator’s decision was wrong, and added: “Ordinary people are facing a Tory cost-of-living crisis. They should get a proper pay rise, not well-paid MPs. That’s why I will donate mine to Coventry Foodbank and other local causes.” One Conservative backbencher told the Guardian they had “already given mine away”, while another said: “Don’t want it, don’t need it, not my decision, now meant to justify it.” People would be furious at the news, said John O’Connell, the chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance. He claimed their anger would be compounded because many will “face crippling tax hikes” and added: “Elected officials should show restraint and only accept rises when economic conditions allow.” Meanwhile, the Trades Union Congress said it was “time for a pay rise for all workers - not just MPs”. Some MPs privately voiced support for the move, noting that the rise was well below current levels of inflation. One said” “We either want pay set independently or we want MPs to control their own pay. We can’t have it both ways. “We appear to want to run headlong (back) into a world where only wealthy people can afford to be MPs. Ipsa is independent for a reason.” Another noted that when Ipsa consulted on raising MPs’ pay for 2021-22, the original rise considered was 4.1%. In the end, the watchdog U-turned because it said any increase “would be inconsistent with the wider economic data and would not reflect the reality that many constituents are facing”, meaning MPs’ received no extra earnings. National insurance is due to rise by 1.25% for both workers and businesses next month. There are also concerns about inflation, a dramatically-increased energy price cap and concerns costs could soar further given the sanctions announced to tackle Russia’s economy following the invasion of Ukraine.",News/Business,"MPs to get £2,200 pay rise next month",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/01/mps-to-get-2200-pay-rise-next-month
3/2/2022,"As the publicity drive for his all-English St George’s Day world title fight against Dillian Whyte cranked into gear at Wembley Stadium on Tuesday – albeit without the involvement of his opponent – patriotism was uppermost in Tyson Fury’s mind. Promising to win the fight “for England and Saint George”, Fury also said that should his own country ever be forced into armed conflict he would immediately come to its defence, as the Ukrainian boxers Oleksandr Usyk, Wladimir and Vitali Klitschko, and Vasiliy Lomachenko have in volunteering this week for their nation’s army. “I’ll be the first one to join up if England get involved, I’ll be first in line for the job,” Fury said. “My dad will as well, and all the boys. We’ll be signing up to defend. If you’re from a country, living there, defend her. Love your woman and defend your country, that’s what I say.” Fury said the bravery being displayed by the Ukrainian boxers is nothing out of the ordinary: “Like I said, I live by two rules. One of them’s love your woman, the other one’s defend your country and fight for it. They’re doing what they need to do really.” Frank Warren, whose Queensberry Promotions is putting on the fight between Fury and Whyte on 23 April, said: “Everybody should be absolutely pulling for Ukraine, standing up to the bully, standing up for democracy. Those four fighters, everybody should be behind them. It’s magnificent what they’re doing.” Despite apparently demanding a private jet to bring him to London, Whyte decided not to break away from his training camp in Portugal to attend the press conference because of various grievances with Queensberry. His lawyer Jeffrey Benz raged that they were “dealing with dinosaurs” and that Queensberry “didn’t even give us notice of where and when this one-sided shindig will occur”. Queensberry countered that Whyte “seems to have a raft of excuses for not turning up, none of which hold water”, and Warren suggested it was a ploy to avoid interacting with Fury. “Tyson, he gets into his opponents’ heads and I think Whyte’s worried about that, that’s why he’s not here. It’s disgraceful, it’s not professional. This is madness.” In Whyte’s absence Fury revelled in his ability to make the wildest possible predictions about the outcome of the fight without the inconvenience of anyone disagreeing with him. Having initially said that Whyte was going to “come in rugged and rough and prepared and aggressive and who knows, it could be me chinned,” the 33-year-old grew increasingly bullish. “If I can’t look like Muhammad Ali fighting this guy I’m in the wrong profession,” he said. “I’ll chop him to bits, no problem. You’re going to see a masterclass. The difference in levels, you’re going to see a Ferrari racing a Vauxhall Corsa. I could beat Dillian Whyte with one arm tied behind my back and one foot off the floor.” The Brixton-born Whyte has spent several years demanding the chance to fight Fury, accusing his rival of “trying everything to avoid me”. “He’s not a fighting man as he claims, but a running man,” Whyte said in 2019. “He’s not the Gypsy King, he’s the Gypsy coward.” Having now scheduled the fight – with the purse split 80/20 in Fury’s favour, giving him £22m, the challenger £6.1m and a further £3m to the victor – Fury was not going to waste the opportunity to flip those particular claims. “He’s been saying everyone’s been avoiding him, running away,” he said. “I’d have thought he’d have come here, because it’s his moment in the sun. He should be here today kissing my feet, because I’m giving him the biggest payday he’ll get in his life. He has shown the white flag today. “Before I was like, when I say stuff about Dillian Whyte he always fights back and causes a ruckus, now it’s say what you want. He’s given me so much confidence it’s unbelievable. Of course he doesn’t want to go face to face with me because he’ll see the fire in my eyes, and he’ll know he’s going to get smashed to bits.”",Sport/Sport,Tyson Fury promises to beat Dillian Whyte ‘for England and St George’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/01/tyson-fury-promises-to-beat-dillian-whyte-for-england-and-st-george
3/2/2022,"Unboxed – the controversial and now heavily rebranded Festival UK 2022 – launched on 1 March, with a pledge to treat the whole of the UK as a venue and satisfy the public’s “huge appetite to get out again and stand next to other human beings.” The choice to launch the first of the 10 major multi-site projects in Paisley was “a statement of intent”, according to chief creative officer Martin Green. “It is simply not on that large scale work of quality often gets dragged into the metropolis.” Hailed by organisers as a “once-in-a-lifetime celebration of UK creativity”, the entirely free programme of events will take place from end to end of the four nations and span traditional and online media until October. The project was greeted with considerable scepticism when it was originally floated by former prime minister Theresa May in 2018, dubbed the Brexit festival and invited dubious comparison with the 1951 Festival of Britain. The UK government was later urged to rethink the festival amid criticism of the £120m funding outlay, as the country struggles to recover from the pandemic. Green, who confirmed that the festival was “on budget and on time”, said that the scepticism was based on “a myth” about the nature of the project, adding: “We have a huge appetite and it’s clear that people want to get out again. They want to stand next to other human beings and have new experiences, and so I’m really pleased to be able to provide some of those opportunities through the 643 different acts that we will be seeing across the UK.” The celebration – supported by the four governments of the UK – begins at Paisley Abbey on Tuesday evening with About Us, an immersive history of the universe from the big bang to the present day, combining multimedia installations and live performance. Created by 59 Productions, the Poetry Society and Stemettes, it will tour to Derry, Caernarfon, Luton and Hull to explore the infinite ways in which humans are connected across 13.8 bn years. The project’s composer Nitin Sawhney described the challenge of “compressing the history of the universe into 25 minutes”. “To find sounds that accompany each aspect of that journey and score that was such an incredible privilege.” About Us is the first of 10 major projects commissioned as part of Unboxed, which encompass science, technology, engineering, arts and maths and aims to reach 2.5 million young people. Dandelion is a Scotland-wide project inspired by the global “grow-your-own” movement, and aims to reinvent the traditional harvest festival for a new generation, with unexpected gardens, vertical farms and plant giveaways popping up across the country. Dreamachine, presented in the UK’s four capital cities, is an artwork that aims to unlock the kaleidoscopic power of the human mind and also to be one of the largest studies of neuroscience ever undertaken. Galwad will see the National Theatre of Wales taking the whole of the country to year 2052 for one week in September, using world-building techniques. Green Space Dark Skies has invented lighting technology to create illuminating outdoor artworks in 20 of the UK’s national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty, including the Cairngorms, Gower Peninsula and the Brecon Beacons.
