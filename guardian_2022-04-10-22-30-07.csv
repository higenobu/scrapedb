4/10/2022,"Why don’t other countries have pubs? I’ve never been to a proper pub anywhere outside the UK or Ireland. Scotty Gascoigne, Haggerston Send new questions to nq@theguardian.com. Give it another decade and we won’t have any either. Massive duties on beer, high rents and people’s infatuation with overpriced coffee and cake will kill them off. Jon Hillman It’s related to the climate of the British islands, allowing its inhabitants to skip heating their mouldy houses. They find it’s a much better idea to crowd in a cosy pub, enjoying the heat from the fireplace as well as from the gin. Other, less fortunate nations prefer their constantly heated living rooms. Rolf Ericsson One of the main reasons for pubs not existing outside our northern European corner is the climate. Much of the alcohol-consuming globe has a more reliable climate, which gives rise to pavement-based cafe culture. Coupled with our unhealthy relationship with alcohol caused primarily from escaping from our longer working weeks (poor work-life balance), it has led to our pub culture. Paul Merry It’s just one of those cultural traditions that evolved in a certain part of the world due to the uniqueness of a particular society, history, climate, cuisine etc. You could ask why Italy is the only country with “proper” trattorias, or France the only country with “proper” bistros, or the US the only country with “proper” diners. In all those cases the type of establishment evolved in line with the unique cultural and societal characteristics of those countries. The concept of a “social gathering place with food and drink for local residents” is not unique to the British Isles, but the specific characteristics of those establishments are obviously going to reflect the local conditions (pubs with large fireplaces for the cold climate, for example, or bars designed to cater to industrial workers who wanted some social interaction at the end of their long shifts). pipspeak I’m Dutch and I might as well ask why there aren’t any proper bruine kroegen (brown cafes) anywhere else in the world. With Persian rugs on the tables. johan1974 Pubs are what the sociologist Ray Oldenburg calls “third places”, “hangouts at the heart of a community”. They generate a sense of place and provide a “neutral ground”, which is characterised by intimacy and cosiness, but which could be attributed neither entirely to the sphere of the state nor to the sphere of the economy, neither to private life nor to the public, but which mediated between the respective spheres and thus has a socially balancing effect. Understood in this way, third places can be found in many societies – in my home town of Vienna, the coffee house would be one such place. So it seems to me that the initial thesis that what characterises a decent pub only exists in the UK and Ireland might not quite correct – at least if we look at it through sociological glasses. thmswtz Plenty of local Kneipen (singular Kneipe) to be found in Germany There’s even a word for your local on the corner, Eckkneipe. Bekaha010 Estonia’s village landscapes certainly used to have a thing similar to pubs: known as kõrts, a place where men went to drink and socialise, with a reputation of excessive alcohol consumption, fights and other unpleasantness. Compared with a century ago, the few kõrtsid that are left now cater to tourists and are far more food-centric, and locals with drinking problems congregate near village grocery stores. If anyone’s visiting, I recommend Altja kõrts in Lahemaa national park, great food. Viitna kõrts is more famous but less authentic, and the food is so-so. missnegative I feel sad for the questioner who claims only the UK and Ireland have proper pubs. He has clearly never been to the blessed shores of Canada where await pubs of a most congenial nature. In my home province of Nova Scotia, pub culture is particularly strong, with the classic pub menu items of fish and chips (oh, the fresh fish they offer) and other delicious if less-than-healthy offerings. Live music in the evenings is central to the culture as well. And while I extol the virtue of Nova Scotia public houses, be assured a warm welcome awaits you all across this broad and be-pubbed land. Come for a pint, my friend. You won’t regret it. Tim Gauthier, Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, Canada I’m speaking for Germany. Germans are too daft to understand the concept of ordering at the bar and paying directly, and then moving away with your drink, and food getting taken to your table. Germans insist on sitting down, then having to wait until a waiter arrives. Then they order, wait for the drinks and food, and after they are finished wave to and wait for a waiter to pay. Lots of waiting. Ever since I got introduced to the concept of a pub I regularly start tearing my hair, but that’s how it is here in Germany. There was one very popular students’ place in Erlangen, called the Pleitegeier, where ordering and serving worked like in a pub. Well, guess what – they made a survey among their customers whether they should switch to the German model and, lo and behold, the customers wanted it. So now there’s the usual atmosphere: everyone sits at a table of their own, waiting for the, er, waiter. Marion Dickten Thinking about it, in order to have pubs or pub-like spaces, there are some cultural prerequisites. A strong drinking culture, obviously, but also a culture that values a sort of communal cosiness centered around alcohol consumption. There’s no word in English for this kind of boozy group hygge, but I think it definitely exists. fantod I read this headline in the Guardian and thought “let me think, surely this isn’t quite correct” but the more I thought about it the more I tended to agree! Patrick Cusack It seems that you have not been fortunate enough to visit the Czech Republic, and not just Prague: Plzeň, Hradec Králové, České Budějovice, Brno all have pubs which have great atmosphere, excellent beer and wholesome, modestly priced food, especially in the winter. Mike O’Connell I’ve done a fair bit of international travel in my lifetime and I believe that it comes down to two main factors. First, the weather: in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England it is unpredictable at best and often quite shite. So having a nice, dry, warm place (with a roof) to skull pints and meet your cronies is a must. Second, the banter. In this part of the world we love to talk shite especially about the weather. So having a nice, dry, warm place (with a roof) to skull pints and meet your cronies is a must. Liam I’ve been to real pubs in Toronto and Cambridge in Ontario. Great pubs in Montreal and plenty of what I would call pubs in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Maybe I don’t know what a pub is. J Barbour, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia You need to get out more. Been to proper pubs in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Portugal, Canada, US, Australia. Tim Sale I must take issue with the statement about real pubs not existing outside the UK and Ireland. Please accept my invitation to visit The Tavern in the Old Town Marbella as part of your research. Bob Evans I think perhaps that you need to broaden your understanding of “pub”. We, here in the high mountains of northern New Mexico USA, have a brewery co-op with 1) a fireplace, 2) barkeeps that know your name, 3) doggos are welcome everywhere. The beer’s pretty OK too. Sure, it’s in a “strip mall” storefront, but they are good people and a great addition to our town. Not all “pubs” come with thatched roofs – but they do come with a sense of community and openness. Michael Johnson, Los Alamos Oh, oh, why is Latvia the only country that have a proper krogi?! mikkamobile A proper pub is where you can go for a drink, not make arrangements and be confident that you will know people there to sit down with. Only had that in two places in my life – one was in California. PeteTheBeat Well, here I am in New Jersey smoking a cigar in a pub, comfy leather chairs, food, draught beer but no open fire. Everywhere I’ve worked and lived outside the UK – from South Africa, Hong Kong, Denmark, Turkey to the US – has pubs, maybe you call them bars but honestly everywhere has pubs … Cleveland had a great pub/bar culture, that was no different to the pubs I drank in back in the UK. USLanky34 Years ago I was travelling from Belfast to Dublin well after closing time when my companion (who was driving) said: “Fancy a drink?” He knocked on a door in a row of terrace houses round by the Dundalk docks – there was nothing to indicate a licensed premises. Inside there was a small bar not much bigger than a sitting room, and fire in the grate. No draft beer, just bottled Guinness. It was warm and you could stay as long as you liked. Now that’s what I call a proper pub.

4/10/2022,"In his first film, the $4m Sundance sensation The Witch, Robert Eggers etched a human battle between Puritanism and the occult in 17th-century New England, written entirely in early modern English. He followed it up with The Lighthouse, a surrealist survival nightmare, soaked in sea salt and maritime slang, jumbling toxic masculinity, fart jokes and octopus-punching. This is the kind of film-making upon which auteurist cults are built; but it does not, conventionally, inspire Hollywood studios to write the director in question a fat cheque for a blockbuster. And yet. The Northman, Eggers’s vast, bonkers, exhilarating third feature, was made for the price of several Witches and Lighthouses, but hasn’t come at much cost to the 38-year-old film-maker’s strange, distinct sensibility. A pounding, weather-lashed, brutal Viking revenge tale rooted in the Scandinavian folk legend of Amleth, it significantly ups the action ante for a director whose previous most elaborate set piece in that regard was a homoerotic wrestling scene between two crazed lighthouse-keepers played by Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe. Led by a hulking Alexander Skarsgård as an exiled Icelandic prince out to avenge his father’s murder and reclaim his kingdom, it has all the blood and muscle you associate with the genre, plus a glitzy ensemble including Nicole Kidman as Amleth’s mother, Ethan Hawke as his father and Anya Taylor-Joy (seven years after her star-making debut in The Witch) as his lover. There’s even a cameo from Icelandic pop deity Björk, in her first film in 17 years. Still, the film’s rich historical idiom, rampant spirituality and ambiguous heroism feel far more Eggers than its blockbuster budget ($70m, he says) might suggest. “Let’s just hope it busts some blocks,” he laughs half-nervously, shifting slightly on a sofa in London’s Soho Hotel: it’s just after breakfast, the sun is out, and he’s looking forward to a Sunday out in the city with his wife, Alexandra Shaker, a clinical psychologist, and their young son, Houston. The plush hotel doesn’t seem his natural environment – but then Eggers has been on unfamiliar turf at every stage of this project. Where his first two films were inexpensive and wholly under his creative command, shifting away from independent film-making didn’t just mean handling bigger sets, a bigger cast and bigger practical challenges, but relinquishing control to the studio over the film’s final cut. A recent New Yorker profile of Eggers detailed what appeared to be a tough post-production process, with some resistant feedback from the money men and test audiences. He admits now to being “frustrated” by the narrative that emerged from that interview; the reality, he says, involved a fair degree of give and take. To a large extent the studio indulged Eggers’s idiosyncrasies, allowing him to work with his regular heads of department, including cinematographer Jarin Blaschke. Eggers and Blaschke’s preference for long, exactingly planned takes, eschewing second units, results in a textured aesthetic and a hurtling, immersive perspective that you rarely see in today’s carefully vetted, committee-made action movies – it’s anathema to mainstream studios with an eye on the clock and a hand on the purse strings. It was an arduous shoot. Skarsgård has spoken of his physical exhaustion during filming, describing himself as “truly a wreck” after certain scenes. “Alex said to me at one point, ‘You’re doing this on purpose to drive me insane,’” Eggers says. “But I don’t choose these environments to be sadistic. I choose them because these are the environments that my films take place in.” The editing process, meanwhile, brought its own challenges. “I hadn’t had to do test screenings before,” he admits. “My first two films were all tested for marketing, but I didn’t have to change anything. So this was new, and as much as I didn’t like that process, I did learn something from it. But more than that, this is the film I wanted to make. This is my director’s cut. The studio pressure made the film what I originally pitched to them, which was the most entertaining Robert Eggers movie I could make. Honestly, without their pressure, I couldn’t have done that. It’s hard for me to tell a story with a beginning, a middle and an end, for goodness’s sake.” I express surprise at this statement: his previous films, for all their dark eccentricities, have been fairly linear, not to mention gripping and often wildly funny. “Entertaining” doesn’t seem an artistic stretch for him. But Eggers is a film-maker as much preoccupied with the way his stories are told – and the singular, often archaic language he writes them in – as with the story itself. The Northman rivets its audience in a different way from most mainstream hero’s-journey films: its moral compass keeps spinning, the value and valour of Prince Amleth’s revenge mission is constantly in question. It’s the same ancient myth that trickled down into William Shakespeare’s similarly conflicted Hamlet: Eggers, himself the son of a Shakespeare professor, was more drawn to that psychological complexity than the warrior pageantry of it all. Though Conan the Barbarian was a childhood favourite, this is not the kind of film Eggers ever imagined making. Growing up in the small town of Lee, New Hampshire – his mother was an actor, his father the provost at the local university – Eggers was not a typical child. A youthful love of comic books gave way to more esoteric interests when a family friend introduced him to the northern Renaissance engravings of Albrecht Dürer and the like. “At the time I was trying to draw the comic book characters. But suddenly the medieval world was much more interesting to me than the comic books.” The young Eggers’s fascination with the past mingled with an equally keen interest in theatre. As a high-schooler, he directed a wildly stylised stage interpretation of the classic German expressionist vampire film Nosferatu; years later, in New York, he studied acting and dabbled in street theatre. Film-making came later, self-taught via experimental shorts: he describes his first, a spin on Hansel and Gretel, as “absolutely terrible”: “It got into one festival,” he says, “and on the way home, I decided I had to do something better.” Today, dressed in black workwear, with a neatly kept beard, ornate rings on his fingers and a keen gaze, he still looks more likely to spring a poetry reading on you than a fist fight. “I’m shocked I made such a macho movie,” he says, before admitting that his interest in history had not, until recently, extended to Vikings. “This whole thing is a surprise to me: the macho stereotype of that history, along with, you know, the rightwing misappropriation of Viking culture, made me sort of allergic to it, and I just never wanted to go there.” That attitude shifted on a vacation to Iceland: “Everyone says this, but the landscapes were so incredibly inspiring and epic and pre-pre-historical. And it’s the power of those landscapes that got me to pick up the Icelandic sagas.” While he was there, a mutual friend arranged a meeting with Björk; she in turn introduced Eggers to the Icelandic poet, novelist and sometime screenwriter Sjón, who also recently co-wrote the loopy folk-horror film Lamb. “We started talking about early modern witchcraft and just got along famously,” says Eggers: only from him would this count as an ordinary ice-breaker. “I started to read his books when I got back to the States and was again very inspired. His mind is really extraordinary – to me, he’s a literary giant.” The trip hatched the idea of a Viking movie, made Eggers-style; years later, while having lunch with Skarsgård, he learned of the actor’s long-held ambition to make a Viking epic with producer Lars Knudsen. The dots connected; with the plan in motion, Eggers decided he needed an Icelandic co-writer, and Sjón was his first choice. “Even the most Viking-allergic Icelander knows what saga characters they’re directly related to, and that literature is part of everyone’s cultural understanding and their personas: many contemporary Icelanders still believe in land spirits and fairies. I needed that.” In all of Eggers’s features to date, the physical and spiritual realms feel closely and practically connected, even adjacent, to the point of disorienting overlap; the vivid prospect of Valhalla beckons Amleth throughout The Northman, an afterlife neither queried nor idealised. I ask Eggers if he regards himself as a spiritual or religious person, and he hesitates. “Not in any kind of a traditional way,” he answers, “but certainly in all my work, and I’m not saying I’m succeeding in this, but I am trying to reach the sublime. So I suppose that’s why I am interested in these periods of history: there are no Viking atheists. There are Valkyries and giants and trolls, and sometimes people get put off that they’re in these sagas that are supposed to be naturalistic. And I’m like, yeah, but they believed that this was real. It’s naturalistic to them. “It’s so frustrating being an American film-maker sometimes, where even the small movies are so much more concerned about getting that profit back, and it gets so wrapped up in, like, your brand and your identity. This is going to sound awfully precious – you know, feel free to puke – but the idea of medieval craftsmen are doing it for God is an appealing one to me.” In place of God in this model, we have the studios, and Eggers still seems somewhat astonished that he got one to invest in his metaphysical (albeit crashingly violent) idea of a Viking epic. “Luck is a thing, and as is more or less said in the film, the Norns of fate weave a mysterious thread,” he says with a wry shrug. On a more practical level, the production company New Regency had worked with Eggers on The Lighthouse and was happy to invest again. “I do think they were partially hoping I would want do something more commercial,” he laughs. “Sjón and I happened to have a draft of The Northman in good shape, and thanks to the History Channel and a bunch of TV shows and video games, there seemed to be an appetite for Viking stories. So the marketing team felt like this wasn’t completely irresponsible.” It remains to be seen whether The Northman turns a significant profit, but it feels like a film built to endure. And it has given Eggers a taste for big canvases on which to paint his biggest ideas, though he’d prefer to keep alternating between independent and studio projects: “I certainly want to do something smaller next, and not just because of the pressure and the pain, which is super real,” he says. “But also because I learned so much on The Northman, which was really a film that was way too big for my britches. And I finally feel like I actually know how to make a movie now, you know?” Did he not before? “Honestly, I can’t stand watching The Witch now,” he sighs. “It’s not that it’s bad, and the performances are great, but I was not skilled enough as a film-maker to get what was in my brain on to the screen. In The Lighthouse, I was able to do that. And The Northman, I’m proud of the movie, but not everything is quite what I hoped it would be. So I would like to do something with the scope and scale that I can actually get what’s in my imagination on to the screen.” It’s not the kind of humility you tend to hear from a director promoting the grandest work of their career thus far; it also doesn’t sound like Eggers is about to sign a contract with Marvel any time soon. “I’ve definitely had, like, not Marvel, but the big studio meeting. But I also don’t know what I have to offer. Everything that I’m particularly good at, or that makes me unique, is not helpful in making a Marvel movie.” He doesn’t watch superhero films, having left them behind with the comics of his boyhood, though he recently made an exception for Matt Reeves’s mood-heavy The Batman, which impressed him: “I saw it really just because Rob [Pattinson] is my friend. But I liked it, and I learned a lot of stuff from it, frankly. I applaud Matt Reeves for keeping an identity and making a film like that. I can’t imagine. I guess I just made a big movie, but it’s not the same.” Beyond that “smaller movie” tease, Eggers avoids giving any hint of what he’s really planning next – “Respectfully, I’m going to be elusive about this,” he says – though a long-planned reimagining of his adolescent favourite Nosferatu is still on the boil. Taylor-Joy has been attached; so was Harry Styles at one point, though no more. “I do want to be clear that Harry was going to be Thomas Hutter and not the vampire,” he says drily – the Styles fandom is not one to be messed with. “I hope that it happens,” he continues. “I’ve spent so much time, you know, thinking about it and scouting: it would be a shame if it somehow doesn’t happen. But it seems shocking to me that it’s fallen apart twice already.” He shrugs. Each new film is its own challenge. For now, once his epic is out in the world, he’s simply after some time for writing, breathing and parenting. After 17 years in New York, he and Shaker moved to Dublin for the production of The Northman; he’s considering relocating permanently to London. He mentioned earlier being frustrated with American film-making – does that extend to America itself? He nods. “My wife and I both are from New Hampshire. We’ve spent some time there recently. And it’s, you know, heartbreaking that in many ways it’s more small-minded and divided than when we grew up there. That’s sad. Not that things are comfortable in Europe, exactly.” Mostly, as with his films, he’s drawn to immersing himself in unfamiliar worlds. “I’m an anglophile and I know British history reasonably well and whatever, but I am not from here,” he says. “So there is a way in which I feel like people don’t know everything about me, and I don’t know everything about them. That always feels a little freer.” The Northman is in cinemas from 15 April",Arts/Film,The Northman director Robert Eggers: ‘I’m shocked I made such a macho movie’,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/10/the-northman-director-robert-eggers-interview
4/10/2022,"Director Wils Wilson casts a number of tall actors in Caroline Bird’s play, but one performer towers above them. Like her character, headstrong, passionate and driven, Bettrys Jones is the gravitational force around which all else revolves. This, despite being the shortest on stage. Playing Ellen Wilkinson, the “thumb-sized” Manchester-born MP who rose from prewar activism to postwar minister of education, Jones is a theatrical life force. The centre of attention throughout a three-hour production, she is rooted and calm, commanding without grandstanding. She captures the enthusiasm and contradictions of a politician who, as Bird presents her, put the fight against injustice ahead of friends, lovers and her own wellbeing. It’s quite a story and, as Bird notes in the programme, only one of many possible versions: “there are so many Ellens to choose from”. The one she opts for is a woman who trades an outsider’s ideological purity for the compromises of power. We meet her as the thorn in the side of a complacent Labour party, angry at its indifference to Hitler’s rise, and we leave her not long after she has introduced free school milk and raised the school leaving age to 15. It was Wilkinson who led the Jarrow march, who ventured to Europe to report on the Spanish civil war and who was christened the “shelter queen” during London’s Blitz. She dallied with communism, had second thoughts about pacificism and was accused of selling out once she had power in her grasp. “How do I fight fascism without sacrificing any of my principles?” she says in exasperation. In this way, the play becomes not just a tribute to a pioneering woman, independent and sexually liberated, but also an analysis of the left’s fraught struggle for equality. Red Ellen crackles with modern day resonances, from Starmer’s Labour party to Putin’s war in Ukraine, via the Tory assault on society’s poorest. The Wilkinson we see here can never do enough, her political anger fuelling a lifelong battle to see that right be done. As the pieces of Camilla Clarke’s set fall into disarray and the faces of comrades and adversaries fade from view, the play is as much wistful as agitational, but no less inspirational for that.

4/10/2022,"My father, Shahrokh Vafadari, who has died aged 89, was a prominent member of the Zoroastrian Iranian community in the UK. After retiring from his job as a chemical engineer in 1992 he devoted himself to promoting the Zoroastrian faith and Iranian culture to anyone who was interested. He became an academic authority on the evolution of the Zoroastrian calendar, and was chosen by Robert Winston as an adviser on Zoroastrianism for his 2005 television series The Story of God, escorting Winston to Iran for its filming. In memory of his eldest son, Martin, who died in 1992, Shahrokh also founded the Ferdowsi Trust Fund in a house in Ealing, west London, where he would bring together Iranians, Zoroastrians and others to hear lectures on Persian history, music, art and poetry. He welcomed Iranian refugees and asylum seekers to the house, offering them friendship and a sense of community, in recognition of the difficulties he faced when he first came to the UK. From his birthplace of Kerman in south-east Iran, Shahrokh was brought up in a Zoroastrian priestly family, the youngest of the five children of Rustam, a merchant, and Tootee, a housewife. His mother died when he was 11 and he was sent to Tehran under the guardianship of his older brothers, where he attended Alborz college. At 16 he joined Iran’s Imperial Navy, ending up in Portsmouth as a second lieutenant on HMS Howe as part of a Royal Navy officer exchange training programme. Once his contract ended in 1953 he moved to London, took A-levels and worked odd jobs, living frugally in a bedsit in Earl’s Court, west London. On his first Christmas Day in London he woke up with no food to eat and, finding the shops closed, began to wander further and further away from his home in search of somewhere that was open. By the time he got to Leicester Square the police had begun to take an interest in his movements, which they felt were suspicious, and they apprehended him. Once he was able to convince them that he was simply hungry and had no idea about Christmas, they took him into their local station, served him up a full English breakfast and sent him on his way. After those early hard times, Shahrokh gained a place at Imperial College London to study for a degree in chemical engineering. When he followed up with a master’s degree at the same institution, he gave himself a stomach ulcer and was admitted to St George’s hospital. There Anne Scamell nursed him. They fell in love and were married in 1963. For 30 years Shahrokh then worked as a chemical engineer in the UK and abroad, with companies such as Shell and British Gas. It was once he retired in 1992 that he was really able to give his full attention to studying and publicising the Zoroastrian faith and Iranian culture.

4/10/2022,"My father, Tony Crowe, who has died aged 87, was a brave, radical and controversial priest who was ahead of his time. He championed the ordination of women and gay marriage in the Church of England. He was a longstanding supporter of the Palestinian cause, and a regular letter-writer to the Guardian. He was sincere and wholehearted, but also took pleasure in rubbing the establishment up the wrong way and in the subsequent publicity. Tony was born in Bristol, the middle of three boys, to Murray Crowe, a bank clerk, and Joan (nee Ehlers), a homemaker. He first felt his calling as a schoolboy at Clifton college, Bristol, influenced by Mervyn Stockwood’s social ministry in the city’s poorer districts. He studied theology at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, graduating in 1957, and then trained as a priest at at Westcott House, Cambridge. He was the first deacon ordained in the new Coventry Cathedral in 1959. His first curacy was in Stockingford, a mining village near Nuneaton. There he met Ailsa Wood, a local health visitor. They married in 1962. Tony’s distinctive ministry took shape when they moved to London, in the late 1960s to St John’s, Clapham, and then in 1974 when he became rector at St Luke’s, Charlton. There he fostered a remarkable inclusive church community. As early as 1978, Tony “married” a same-sex couple at St Luke’s. It was a service of blessing, but was covered by the tabloid press as a “gay wedding”. His stance on homosexuality prompted protests by evangelical groups during services, a physical assault, and almost certainly affected his church career progression. Tony also took practical action on the ordination of women. He mentored Liz Canham, who travelled to the US in 1981 for ordination in the Episcopal Church. Three weeks later she was back at the Charlton rectory celebrating Eucharist in front of cameras from BBC Newsnight. Tony gave compassionate mentoring to women training for ordination in the late 1980s and 1990s, supporting those knocked back by hostility and ingrained sexism. Ours was a happy multi-racial family of six children; two of us were adopted and one fostered. Family life in the vicarage was a very public experience as a wide cast of people came for dinner or to stay. Ailsa strongly supported Tony’s values and provided the emotional stability that enabled him to do what he did. Theirs was a shared social ministry. Tony and Ailsa left Charlton in 1994, moving to Whitstable, in Kent. Tony became a part-time prison chaplain at Swaleside and Emley. They enjoyed retirement, especially year-round sea swimming, and walking the dogs. Ailsa died in 2020. Tony is survived by their children, Justin, Dominic, Lucy, Kate and me, and by 13 grandchildren and two great-granddaughters. Another daughter, Rachel, died in 2009.

4/10/2022,"My husband, Keith Hill, who has died aged 87, was an accomplished “outsider artist”, a self-taught sculptor in wood and stone whose work was shown in many galleries in the UK and abroad. He was also a community worker and local politician, an opera lover, a francophile and a flat-racing aficionado. Keith was a risk-taker. When he wanted to do something, he went ahead, and if it worked out, that was fine; and if it didn’t he might try something else. Keith was born in Chingford, Essex, the son of Henry Hill, a policeman, and Gladys (nee Hunter), a housewife. He left secondary modern school in Walthamstow, east London, at 15. After national service Keith spent a year in a Sheffield steel foundry as part of the industrial mission, and decided that he wanted to become a priest. He started his training at Brasted College, Kent, but left to marry his first wife, Jean, in 1958 and moved to London, where he worked as a youth and community organiser in Stepney and Blackfriars. In 1960 he moved north to become warden of Manchester University Settlement, in Ancoats, providing community services such as playgroups, youth clubs, OAP luncheon clubs and advice centres. Keith became involved in local politics in Manchester, serving as a Labour city councillor from his first election in 1962 until 1968 and standing as Labour parliamentary candidate for Knutsford in the 1964 general election. Keith and Jean divorced in 1968. He moved to Oxford in 1974 to become a principal officer for community development for Oxfordshire county social services department, where he met me. We married in 1980. Around this time he began making sculptures, creating groups of people, especially choirs, circuses and orchestras. It became a passion, and in 1998 he gave up his job to become an artist full time. In 1996 he had works accepted by the Royal Academy in London and by the Royal West of England summer shows. His sculptures have been shown in galleries in the UK and France and pieces are held in private collections in Europe, the US and Japan. He was a member of Oxford Art Society from 1991 and chair from 2003 to 2007.

4/10/2022,"Years before Elisabeth Moss first put on Offred’s red kirtle and glowered at the camera from under a white visor, years before the TV series took Margaret Atwood’s book way beyond its ending, there was The Handmaid’s Tale: the opera, by the composer Poul Ruders and librettist Paul Bentley. It was premiered in Copenhagen in 2000 and staged at English National Opera three years later. Now, slightly revised by its authors – and, after Trump and 6 January, seeming more urgently relevant than ever - it’s back in a new staging, the first opera directed here by Annilese Miskimmon since she became ENO’s artistic director. We are at a symposium listening to a newly discovered cassette tape, an artefact from Gilead, presented by an academic played by the actor Camille Cottin. Offred’s voice speaks to us first through the tape, sounding as delicate and distant as old shellac records – and then Kate Lindsey takes over in person, beginning a magnetic central performance in which it’s her voice, with its superbly controlled mix of sweetness and substance, that reveals as much as her actions. The full horror of her situation takes time to be revealed, perhaps too long: the Commander doesn’t turn up on stage for nearly an hour, and the executions in which every handmaid must be complicit happen only towards the end. The Wall displays photographs of the dead, not their hanging bodies. Yet there is subtle menace in the way the characters move in regimented lines in front of the long conference-centre curtains of Annemarie Woods’s set – and, indeed, throughout Ruders’s evocative score, vibrantly played by the ENO orchestra conducted by Joana Carneiro. High, chiming percussion adds a sheen of artificiality, and borrowings from other styles throw up brief associations: there’s a wrenching use of Bach in one of many flashbacks involving Offred’s little daughter. She’s played by the real-life daughter of Rhian Lois, who as Janine is part of a strong supporting cast along with Avery Amereau, Pumeza Matshikiza, Susan Bickley and others. Despite Carneiro’s care, and even though Ruders has reportedly scaled back some of the scoring since the premiere, there are still passages that seem simply noisy, including much of the music for Aunt Lydia, which, despite a tour de force performance from Emma Bell, is pitched so high the surtitles are essential if you want to understand the words. The most effective moments are often the quietest, especially Offred’s intricate duet with her recorded former self – one of many grainy video flashbacks projected onto the curtains in a way that suggests The Time Before is simultaneously light-years away and close enough to touch. Much was made of the fact that there was an all-female production team, with some two dozen female staffers taking a bow at the first-night curtain call. But while this opera tells a woman’s story ostensibly from a woman’s perspective, it’s not the feminist call to arms that the TV series had time and space to develop into: things happen to Offred, not because of her. If ENO wants to stage a real feminist opera it needs to look further, to more recent works, but this is at least a step in the right direction.

4/10/2022,"Simple cognitive tests in midlife could predict the likelihood of falling in later life, one of the most common causes of injury and death, new research suggests. Poor levels of word memory, verbal fluency, processing speed and cognitive ability in our 50s are early indicators of worsening balance in later life, a condition that increases the risk of falls, injury and death, researchers from University College London have found. The findings also open the intriguing possibility that cognitive training in midlife could have a positive impact on balance as we age. “Our research highlights that there is strong cognitive component involved in successful balance,” said Dr Joanna Blodgett, lead author of the paper. “Current balance/fall risk interventions tend to focus on physical aspects, such as strength or balance training. However, it may now be useful to investigate if interventions that improve cognition could also improve balance.” Previous research on balance ability has mainly focused on physical aspects such as underlying musculoskeletal strength or mobility. “Our research shows that given the crucial neural integration of sensory input and motor response required to maintain balance is one of the physical capability measures most closely linked to cognitive ability,” said Blodgett. Falls are the most common cause of injury-related deaths in people over the age of 75 and cost the NHS around £1bn a year. Hip fractures are the most common cause of accidental death in older people. But despite their serious consequences, falls in later life are often dismissed as an inevitable part of growing older. Blodgett said that her findings, based on a study of 3,000 people from the MRC National Survey of Health and Development, a British birth cohort study, and published in the Journals of Gerontology, could enable targeted interventions in midlife that will protect people in later life. The ability to balance relies on cognitive processing of information from three directions, said Blodgett. Firstly, from what we see; secondly, what our body senses through movement and position, and thirdly, stimulation identified by our inner ear and fed back to the brain. “Simple cognitive tests could identify individuals at risk of poor balance, providing opportunities for both screening and interventions,” she said. “Understanding these associations earlier in midlife, either before or in the early stages of decline, is particularly important to prevent or mitigate loss of independent mobility.” No previous study has investigated age-related changes between specific cognitive processes and balance in midlife, said Blodgett, or considered mutual adjustment of multiple cognitive measures. “As such, several of our study findings are novel,” she said. Blodgett’s research was welcomed by Age UK Policy Manager, Dr Lis Boulton, who said it should be introduced into the NHS’s Health Check for adults in England aged 40 to 74. “These findings could be useful in helping to identify people who might be at greater risk of poor balance in later life and to then give them targeted advice in the form of balance exercises,” she said. Dawn Skelton, a professor in Ageing and Health at Glasgow Caledonian University, said the paper was insightful. “Balance isn’t just about muscle strength in your legs or in your core,” she said. “It’s also about you, your mental capacity and your brain, and how well the brain knows which muscles to turn on and off at what time and how quickly, and which part you need to twist in order to keep yourself up. You need to have lots of things going on in the brain to be able to cope with that.”",News/Education,Midlife cognitive training could improve balance in later life,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/10/midlife-cognitive-training-could-improve-balance-in-later-life
