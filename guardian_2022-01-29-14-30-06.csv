1/29/2022,"Choral music wafted through the nave of the Cathedral of the Russian Armed Forces as Alexei Rozhkov, a visiting priest, considered the question: was Russia standing on the precipice of a new great conflict in Ukraine? “There won’t be a war – there can’t,” he said quickly, glancing up at the skylights of stained glass depicting Soviet medals and religious symbols on the ceiling.  The cathedral was built recently as a testament to Russia’s pride in its military glory, ranging from the victory in the second world war to more recent conflicts. A mosaic on one wall glorifies the Russian soldiers who fought in Georgia in 2008 and Syria in 2015, as well as the “little green men” who annexed Crimea in 2014. But like others there, Rozhkov said he could not see what could motivate Russia to launch an attack on Ukraine today – despite Vladimir Putin’s public ultimatums to the west and the tanks, missiles and other weapons continuing to make their way to the Ukrainian border. “When Russia has gone to war, it’s gone to war for a reason,” he said. “And there is no reason for this bloodshed, there’s nothing worth it in today’s world. What would [people] be fighting for? … And how can you fight a war without people?” Despite warnings from the US that an attack could be imminent, one would have been hard pressed walking around Moscow to guess that something extraordinary was afoot. “Leaders need to talk tough, this is just hysteria,” said Konstantin Danilin, 36, who had brought his two daughters to go tubing at Park Patriot, an amusement park just outside Moscow opened by the Russian military. “Putin is aggressive: he takes risks, it’s possible he makes mistakes. But this is all just a negotiation.” Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and support for the subsequent war in Donbas led to a mass mobilisation of Russian society. Pro-government and anti-war marches were held, and families and friends fell into bitter disputes about the conflict. Putin’s popularity rating rode the wave of patriotism to an all-time high. Russian volunteers, mercenaries and soldiers fought and died in the ensuing conflict. Now, as Russia approaches a perhaps even more fateful war, it feels as though the public has barely taken note, despite the warning signs coming from both sides. Denis Volkov, of the Levada Centre, an independent polling agency, said: “When this topic comes up in groups in the last two or three months, people say: ‘Oy, as soon as I hear the word [Ukraine], I just change the channel. I don’t even want to know what’s going on there. Ukraine again, war again, I don’t even want to get into it.’” Levada found in December that a majority of Russians did not believe there would be a larger war in Ukraine. In the same poll, two-thirds of respondents blamed the US, Nato or Ukraine for the escalating tensions. “Nobody wants [war] but they’re internally they’ve been prepared for this situation,” Volkov said. Some pundits have pointed towards the lack of a public frenzy in Russia as a sign that the government is not preparing people for a war, although Russia’s continued involvement in the Ukrainian and Syrian conflicts has also taken place with little fanfare. Volkov said the lack of enthusiasm for and attention paid to the conflict might also present the Kremlin with an opportunity. “It’s far more important that people are ready to accept whatever happens,” he said. “The majority will not protest. And that means the government’s hands are free … It’s apathy and how people will view Russia’s place in this conflict as justified that are important.” Tikhon Dzyadko, the editor-in-chief of the independent TV Rain channel, said he had noticed heightened concern among his circle of friends, many of whom had protested against the outbreak of war in 2014, that a new conflict was coming. But it was understandable why the public reaction could be muted, he said. First, the war has been going on in Ukraine for eight years and Russians have slowly grown used to it. And second, Russian society is so beaten down by the government’s repressive atmosphere that it is hard to imagine any protest taking place right now. On the other side, there is little in the Kremlin’s motivations to galvanise public opinion about the conflict. “Nobody understands why there’s been an escalation. And nobody understands who needs this,” he said. “The absolute majority of people I know don’t want this. It’s not some kind of sacred war against an aggressor that has attacked your country. It’s the realisation of some indescribable geopolitical interests, which may lead to the deaths of people.” There are signs too that even in elite business circles, which have benefited from access to the Kremlin, many people have grown unhappy with the situation. “While nobody wants war, don’t expect big business to stand up and voice their opposition,” an investment banker told the Moscow Times this week, speaking anonymously. “We have become passengers. The business community will only discuss war in their kitchens. Everybody will stay quiet in public.” Perhaps most surprising is the relative silence of Putin, who has largely vanished from the airwaves at a moment when so much depends on his coming decision. The Russian leader has barely addressed the Ukraine crisis since the new year, leaving TV anchors, pundits and Russian diplomats involved in negotiations to lead the nightly newscasts that inform the majority of the public. These shows have had a clear message, noted Volkov, by increasingly portraying the west as unhinged and Russia as the voice of reason. In a monologue this week on state television, the leading pro-Kremlin host Dmitry Kiselyov said: “They keep harping at us – you’re about to attack Ukraine. This isn’t about Ukraine. It’s about something much larger.”",News/World news,‘This is just hysteria’: Russians unmoved by threat of Ukraine conflict,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/29/russians-unmoved-by-threat-of-ukraine-conflict
1/29/2022,"When 24-year-old Krai Saidee returned to his alma mater Chiang Mai University on 14 January, nearly two years after his graduation, he came not just to support his friends but to make a political statement. Painted gold, he held up a sign attached to a graduation gown: “You took my dream, and gave me this,” the message read.  Krai is part of a growing number of young Thais who are refusing to attend their graduation ceremonies because they are presided over by members of the royal family. “The protests taught me a lot about the monarchy and how much money goes to the monarchy,” said Krai, referring to demonstrations that erupted in 2020 calling for reforms to the powerful monarchy. Two of Krai’s friends and fellow protesters were arrested during the January protest but released that same day after paying a fine. Many who speak out against the monarchy aren’t as lucky. Thailand’s infamous lese majeste law, which prohibits insulting members of the royal family, is punishable with up to 15 years in prison. Despite the risks, Krai said he would continue protesting against the monarchy, with another demonstration scheduled for March. “I’m planning to give some gifts to the graduating students,” he said, adding that he didn’t know what the gifts would be yet, but promised they would be “something political”. “It’s my duty to open the space for young artists and for my friends,” he said, claiming that some of his friends who felt they had to attend the January ceremony thanked him for speaking out. Paul Chambers, a lecturer at Thailand’s Naresuan University, said the arrests might make “martyrs” of the activists and therefore “could succeed in encouraging more students to boycott graduations overseen by royalty”. Freelance actress Panita Hutacharern, 26, who refused to go to her graduation in 2017, said: “There will be people who are more afraid but there will also be people that are more angry.” But it’s not just legal repression that activists have to worry about – many also face pressure at home. Chambers said that “people of all ages in Thailand are divided regarding monarchy” but “most Thais who venerate the monarchy do come from older generations”. “Parents tend to want to see their sons and daughters attend the rituals of graduation, but these have traditionally been overseen by monarchy so many parents do not mind if royals oversee the ceremonies,” Chambers said. “I argue a lot with my mother,” Panita said, because she was more pro-royalist. Panita said she identified as “anti-royalist” and that attending her graduation ceremony would have been “a waste of time”. “I don’t know why the royal family has anything to do with our graduation.” Luckily for Panita, she had a readymade excuse for her family, because her graduation ceremony took place the same day as her sister’s wedding rehearsal. In Krai’s case, his older sister had already skipped her graduation because of the cost. “I just told my family that it’s about the money,” he said. Graduation ceremonies can be expensive endeavours, with many students shelling out to hire a photographer, a make-up artist and a hair stylist and renting uniforms. The royal family also profits from the ceremonies. “The monarchy makes a great deal of money overseeing graduations so I doubt this practice will end any time soon,” Chambers said, adding that if the monarchy were to cave in to protester demands on this issue, it could “encourage the students to press more”. Boycotts of the graduation ceremonies appear to have picked up steam in recent years. When 35-year-old designer Sina skipped his ceremony more than 10 years ago, 90% of his peers attended, he said. In comparison, Krai said only around 50% of people attend the ceremonies today. “In that time people didn’t realise about all this, nobody talked about the monarchy,” Sina said. In response to the shifting tides, some royalist business owners tried to start a campaign encouraging people to refuse to hire recent graduates that can’t produce a picture of themselves receiving a diploma from the royal family. “I think that it’s good for those students that they are not going to work with those kinds of people,” Panita said, adding that she didn’t think the campaign would catch on. Sina agreed, saying: “They don’t know that people have already changed, that our culture has changed, so they just keep saying the same things that worked before, but it doesn’t work any more.” Using another example, Sina said that in the past, nearly everybody stood out of respect during movie screenings, when a clip played in honour of the king. Today Sina estimates that only around 10% stand. “More than 10 years ago the royalists would pour soda on the people that didn’t stand, but I don’t see any of that any more,” he said. “Now if you stand up, you would be like a person stuck in time.”",News/World news,‘Our culture has changed’: young Thais boycott graduation ceremonies,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/29/our-culture-has-changed-young-thais-boycott-graduation-ceremonies
