3/3/2022,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two-term U.S. Representative Van Taylor on Wednesday withdrew from a Republican primary run-off race, ending his reelection bid after admitting he had an extra-marital affair with the widow of an American who joined the Islamic State, according to media reports. Taylor, who represents a northeast Texas district, last year voted for the creation of a special congressional panel to investigate the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol, earning the ire of former President Donald Trump, whose supporters mounted the deadly attack. Taylor's withdrawal came one day after he led a pack of five Republicans in a primary race with 48.7% of the vote, just shy of the 50% needed to win his party's nomination. With his withdrawal, a former Texas county judge, Keith Self, became the Republican nominee who will run in the Nov. 8 general election for the seat representing an area north of Dallas, including Plano. The Dallas Morning News quoted Taylor telling supporters he had made ""a horrible mistake"" by engaging in the affair with the woman. Taylor's congressional office in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment or say whether he will serve out the remainder of his term.

3/3/2022,"One of the world’s largest yachts, owned by a Russian oligarch who faces sanctions following the invasion of Ukraine, was seized Wednesday by German authorities, marking one of the first super-yachts to be seized as Europe and the U.S. crack down on the Russian billionaires within Vladimir Putin’s orbit. Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov’s custom-built 512-foot yacht Dilbar — which Usmanov purchased in 2016 for $600 million and was, at one point, the largest yacht in the world by tonnage — was seized two days after the European Union announced plans to sanction the oligarch. The Dilbar was docked in Hamburg, Germany, where it was undergoing a refitting job since October 2021, Forbes reports, adding that shipbuilders that were working on the Dilbar didn’t show up for work Wednesday because the German government had taken the yacht.

Usmanov — who the U.S. Senate called a “senior member of Vladimir Putin’s inner circle” while attempting to sanction him under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in 2018 — reportedly has a multi-billion dollar empire that includes metals giant Metalloinvest, the Russian cellphone giant MegaFon, consumer electronics firm Xiaomi, as well as estates throughout Europe. Forbes reports that Usmanov was also among Facebook’s earliest investors. The European Union announced plans to blacklist Usmanov and prohibit his travel throughout the continent as part of the sanctions against Russian oligarchs amid the invasion of Ukraine. Also on Wednesday, the Everton F.C. in the English Premier League severed its sponsorship deal with three Usmanov-owned companies, ESPN reported. This past weekend Roman Abramovich, another alleged Putin associate, handed over stewardship of the Chelsea soccer team to his charitable trust before the U.K. could impose any sanctions on him; Abramovich is now attempting to sell the soccer team ahead of any longterm sanctions against him.

3/3/2022,"Russia may be planning aggressive moves against the Republic of Moldova, according to a map Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko displayed during a meeting of his country's security council. Lukashenko is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He seemingly allowed Putin to use Belarus as a staging ground for his invasion of Ukraine and is reportedly planning to commit his own country's troops to the conflict. The map, which Financial Times Moscow bureau chief Max Seddon shared on Twitter, shows Ukraine split into its four operational command districts and features red arrows that appear to indicate planned troop movements. One of those arrows originates in the southern Ukrainian port city of Odessa, which Russian troops have not yet reached, and terminates on the other side of the Moldovan border. In January, Ukrainian intelligence warned that Russia could initiate false flag operations in Moldova to justify intervening in the pro-Russian separatist-controlled region of Transnistria, according to Al Jazeera. Transnistria, a narrow strip of land with around 400,000 inhabitants, is internationally recognized as part of Moldova, but the Moldovan government has exercised no authority over the breakaway republic since 1992. Russian troops have been stationed in Transnistria ever since. In 2014, after Putin seized control of Crimea, the head of Transnistria's parliament requested to join Russia, BBC reported at the time.
