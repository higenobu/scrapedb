3/24/2022,"Traditional custodians of the Burrup Peninsula want the Western Australian state government to remove a “gag clause” that stops them from mounting real opposition to industrial developments on their land. The Murujuga elders and traditional custodians travelled to Perth from the Kimberley region in the far north of Western Australia on Thursday to deliver an open letter to the government outlining the changes. It was signed by 27 elders and custodians, including both the current and former chair of the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation. Their major concern are sections of the Burrup and Maitland Industrial Estates Agreement (BMIEA), created by the WA government in 2003, which stops traditional owners from objecting to developments on their land. In their letter, the group say their “sacred lands were forcibly acquired”. They call for the government to remove any restrictive clauses and commit to independently funding the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation so it is not reliant on financial support from the fossil fuel industry. Until a new, fairer process is established to give traditional owners actual influence over the development process, they are also calling for a halt to new applications for industrial development in the area. Woodside Energy is currently working on a massive expansion of its gas infrastructure in the area as part of the $16.5bn Scarborough gas project, and fertiliser company Perdaman is planning to build a $4.5bn fertiliser plant which will rely on a portion of the gas produced by Woodside. Raelene Cooper, a Mardudhunera woman and former board member of the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation, said the agreement had been signed 19 years ago by elders who did not understand what they were agreeing to. “I believe this was deceitful,” Cooper said. “In small writing the government has denied us proper procedural fairness in terms of what happens out on the Burrup with projects and development. “The government has been acquiring this land over the last 20 years and pushing forward on developments. It only works one way. “As far as I’m concerned, the agreement is null and void.” The group attempted to meet with the WA premier, Mark McGowan, and Aboriginal affairs minister, Tony Buti, to discuss scrapping the agreement, but were told both were unavailable due to “prior commitments”. Instead they expected to meet with other MPs on Thursday and with representatives from Woodside in a separate meeting.A spokesperson for the WA government said in a statement the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation is “consulted extensively” and the state government “encourages project proponents to obtain informed consent from traditional owners”. “Murujuga is also host to several export industries critical to the Western Australian and national economies, and it is a priority that these co-exist harmoniously with the surrounding cultural heritage,” they said. “There is nothing in the BMIEA agreement preventing MAC, contracting parties, or individual members of those groups from providing submissions under any legislation to protect the cultural and heritage values of Murujuga.” The open letter also called for Woodside shareholders to withhold further investment as the company does not have the “free, prior, and informed consent of Murujuga Traditional Owners” to proceed with its plans for the Scarborough gas field. A Woodside spokesperson said the company “has engaged and consulted extensively” with traditional owners in accordance with its policies and through its own investigations the company has found its developments “will not impact any rock art”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A spokesperson for Perdaman said the company has “followed all legal and regulatory approval processes for the last four years”. “The Burrup and Maitland Industrial Estates Agreements (BMIEA) is an agreement between the WA Government and three previously registered native title claim groups. Amendment of the BMIEA is a matter for the parties to that agreement,” they said in a statement. The Burrup Peninsula in the Pilbara – known as Murujuga to traditional custodians – is an outdoor gallery home to over a million examples of Indigenous rock art produced over a period of 50,000 years. The area was nominated for a world heritage listing in 2018. If successful, this would mean the area is protected in the same way as the pyramids of Giza, Stonehenge and the Taj Mahal. It is also the site of significant industrial development, with fossil fuel companies such as Woodside operating plants for processing gas, and two companies operating fertiliser plants in the area. Traditional custodians have previously raised concerns that the cumulative pollution from these operations is slowly acidifying the rocks, which erodes the art.",News/Australia news,Indigenous elders in WA say ‘gag clause’ denies them a say in industrial developments on their land,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/24/indigenous-elders-in-wa-say-gag-clause-denies-them-a-say-in-industrial-developments-on-their-land
3/24/2022,"Quite how Halo hasn’t made it to the screen, small or big, before this is an enigma almost as nebulous as the long-running first person shooter video game’s crowded mythos. Luminaries such as Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson and District 9’s Neill Blomkamp have all been involved in trying to get a film based on the explosive exploits of Masterchief across the line for the best part of two decades, yet to no avail. Even this big-budget – it reputedly cost more than $200m and looks like gold – TV series starring Pablo Schreiber as the genetically engineered soldier-hero of the United Nations Space Command (UNSC) has been held up for two years by Covid. Never mind, it’s here now, and fans of the games who just want to see their nightly battles with giant space monsters played out on the TV screen will no doubt be more than content with Kyle Killen and Steven Kane’s adventurous if somewhat insipid reimagining. Unfortunately, those of us who don’t recognise every re-enacted power-up bleep and helmet-cam vision of destruction will probably find ourselves wondering, much of the time, quite what is going on.Halo imagines a galaxy set in the 26th century in which the ruling UNSC finds itself under attack from a theocratic alien invading force known as the Covenant, while also at times coming into conflict with frontier settlers on distant planets who bristle under centralised control. To complicate the picture, the Covenant are obsessed with giant, habitable space structures known as the Halo Array, which were left behind by ancient beings known as the Forerunners. The game and TV show seem to borrow from all the good places in modern sci-fi. Aficionados will recognise elements of Larry Niven’s Ringworld saga, as well as a heavy hint of Iain M Banks’s Culture novels, while this new version of Masterchief has a Robocop-lite in space vibe. In the first of two episodes screened so far for press, he stumbles upon a strange glowing artefact on a pioneer world, and after unwittingly activating its mysterious powers begins to experience visions of his former life before being turned into an all-powerful alien-killing badass.Cue some serious awol action, as the power-suited soldier grabs the last remaining settler from the planet, a 17-year-old girl (Yerin Ha) and sets off on what we assume will be a journey of self-discovery with wider significance. Before long he has reconnected with a one-time comrade-turned-deserter (Bokeem Woodbine) who has turned his back on the UNSC for the life of an outlaw, and whose job seems to be to show Masterchief that there is an existence beyond daily extra-terrestrial mass murder.It doesn’t seem as if our man will be given much time off for R&R, however, The Covenant are also after the artefact as part of their ongoing spiritual mission to unlock the secrets of the Halo Array and go on their famed “great journey” to meet the Forerunners. Meanwhile, the UNSC command, deviously nudged along by Natascha McElhone’s slightly mad-looking scientist, Dr Catherine Elizabeth Halsey – she also doubles as the AI Cortana, a major staple of the games – are wondering how in space they are going to get their major asset back.Whoever decided to cast Schreiber, the character actor veteran of shows such as Orange is the New Black (as dodgy prison guard “Pornstache”) and American Gods, as an action hero deserves a medal. Standing 196cm tall and now built like a tank, he makes just the sort of imposing, statuesque figure required for a seemingly unstoppable human battle machine. Unfortunately, the screenwriters aren’t giving him a lot of help this early in the series – Schreiber doesn’t have much to say, and mainly just looks a bit confused that he’s been forced to suddenly stop blowing the bejesus out of monstrous aliens and engage instead with his inner child. This is despite the show giving him ample opportunity to remove his helmet, which rarely happens in the game.The obvious parallels are with The Mandalorian, another show about a seemingly invincible, murderous space warrior who embarks on a path towards becoming a total sweetie. If that’s the long-term plan here, neither the show nor Schreiber has quite nailed it yet. Paramount+ have already commissioned season two, however, so somebody out there clearly thinks they’ve got a hit on their hands. Part of the problem, of course, is that the show could easily end up being hugely popular, thanks to that built-in fanbase, without ever quite managing to navigate far beyond the realms of mediocrity to a distant planet named “half-decent”.

3/24/2022,"The AFL is launching a comprehensive and independent review of the work and advice of concussion doctor Paul McCrory who for years treated and diagnosed athletes suffering concussions and other serious head injuries. The AFL told Guardian Australia the review would be undertaken after the league was unable to answer key questions posed to it about concussion research McCrory was said to have led for the governing body, or the evidence he used to inform concussion policies. The questions were raised earlier this month after McCrory was alleged to have plagiarised the work of another neurology researcher. McCrory has since been accused of further plagiarism, and reportedly apologised, telling the website Retraction Watch that he had requested the papers in question be retracted and the errors “were not deliberate or intentional”. He has not responded to requests for comment from Guardian Australia. He resigned as chair of the Concussion in Sport Group on 5 March amid the allegations of plagiarism. Following repeated requests for comment and specific questions about McCrory’s involvement in their concussion policies the AFL said in a statement: “The AFL will conduct an independent review of the work, research and advice which has been provided to it by Associate Professor Paul McCrory. “The number one priority of our code is to protect the health and wellbeing of all people who participate in our game and so we have made this decision to hold an independent review following a number of revelations in recent weeks of matters of which the AFL was previously unaware,” the statement said. “These matters include one instance of admitted scientific plagiarism by Associate Professor McCrory and the suggestion of other instances of plagiarism.” Last Wednesday Guardian Australia revealed that in May 2018 McCrory voluntarily “provided an enforceable undertaking to the Medical Board of Australia that he will not perform neurodiagnostic procedures, nerve conduction studies, or electromyography until approved to do so by the Board”. A spokesperson for the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) confirmed that undertaking was still in effect, and would remain in force until it was removed from the public register. Asked why the undertaking was given they said “privacy provisions in the National Law prevent us from commenting further”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The AFL said it would also be examining this “recent revelation”. “While Associate Professor McCrory has no ongoing role with the AFL, was not employed by the AFL and was not the only provider of medical advice on concussion to the AFL, he was an important and long-standing adviser on concussion and he was understood by the AFL to be a pre-eminent expert in the field, including up until recently holding the position as Chair of the Concussion in Sport Group and in that capacity worked previously with many leading national and international professional sporting organisations,” the AFL said. “The Concussion in Sport Group has provided many leading sports around the world, including the AFL, with guidance in the translation of evolving research into sport-related concussion and head trauma into practical concussion management protocols. “As is common practice in academic institutions and other organisations in which allegations of plagiarism are made or admitted, the AFL believes it important as a matter of integrity to ascertain the status and the reliability of past research activities and outcomes, and clinical work in which Dr McCrory has been involved for the AFL. “This independent review will be conducted by an independent senior counsel and a professor of medicine experienced in medical and medical research ethics.” Further details of the review will be announced shortly, the AFL said.

3/24/2022,"Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called for citizens worldwide to take to the streets “in the name of peace” and hold global protests against Russia’s bloody war, one month after the invasion began. Zelenskiy’s appeal come as world leaders prepare to hold a series of emergency summits in Europe that aim to ratchet up pressure on Russian president Vladimir Putin to end the war. In a late-night television address from the emptied streets of his nation’s besieged capital Kyiv, a defiant but visibly tired Zelenskiy said on Thursday Ukraine was “waiting for meaningful steps” from the three gatherings – Nato, EU and European Council – and listed some so-far unheeded requests, such as a no-fly zone, aircraft, and tanks. “Our firm position will be represented at these three summits. At these three summits we will see: Who is a friend, who is a partner, and who betrayed us for money.” “The world must stop the war,” he said in English. “Come from your offices, your homes, your schools and universities, come in the name of peace, come with Ukrainian symbols to support Ukraine, to support freedom, to support life.” In Brussels on Thursday, US president Joe Biden will take part in back-to-back Nato, G7 and European Union summits that will bring pledges of more lethal weapons for Ukraine, more punishing sanctions on Russia’s already crisis-wracked economy and warnings about further escalation. Each of the multilateral groups that Biden will join largely welcome a return of US leadership and engagement in Europe after the nadir of the Donald Trump administration. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, told journalists on Air Force One on the way to Brussels: “What we would like to hear is that the resolve and unity that we’ve seen for the past month will endure for as long as it takes.” Zelenskiy, who will speak to Nato members by video on Thursday, also said he is asking the alliance to provide “effective and unrestricted” support to Ukraine, including any weapons the country needs to fend off the Russian invasion. Nato earlier announced it will double its troops along the alliance’s eastern flank, beginning the deployment of four new battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. The month-long conflict has devastated Ukraine, killing thousands and forcing millions to flee their homes, though troops continue to challenge the Russian advance. In its latest update, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Ukraine had increased pressure on Russian forces north-east of Kyiv, while carrying out successful counter attacks against Russian positions in towns on the outskirts of the capital. The MoD noted there is a “realistic possibility” that Ukrainian forces will be able to encircle Russian units in Bucha and Irpin. Earlier, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said that “the small city of Makariv and almost all of Irpin is already under the control of Ukrainian soldiers”. Nato estimates as many as 15,000 Russia soldiers may have been killed in the invasion, roughly the same number the country lost over 10 years of conflict in Afghanistan. Putin’s regime officially puts the number of Russian fallen at under 500, and has introduced draconian censorship laws to prevent independently verified news about what it calls a “special military operation.” Ukraine has released little information about its own military losses, and the west has not given an estimate, though Zelenskiy said nearly two weeks ago that about 1,300 Ukrainian servicemen had been killed. Despite some unexpected shows of strength by Ukraine, Russian forces continued relentless attacks on the nation’s towns and cities. In the besieged northern city of Chernihiv, Russian forces have been accused of taking hostages, as desperate local officials imposed drinking water rationing on trapped civilians. About 150,000 people are stuck in the northern city with little hope of aid after Russia cut them off from Kyiv, 100 miles south, by bombing a road bridge across the Desna River. Chernihiv, which has been the focus of intense fighting in which tens of people have been killed a day, has already been without power for days, with looting rife, as the city has collapsed into chaos. In Kyiv, where near-constant shelling and gunfire shook the city on Wednesday as the two sides battled for control of multiple suburbs. Mayor Klitschko said at least 264 civilians have been killed in the capital since the war broke out. The shelling also claimed the life of another journalist Wednesday. The independent Russian news outlet The Insider said Russian journalist Oksana Baulina had been killed in a Kyiv neighborhood. Western leaders remain concerned about any possible escalation in the conflict. Nato countries are expected to agree at Thursday’s summit to provide special kit to protect Ukraine against any chemical, biological or nuclear attacks launched by Russia. Jens Stoltenberg, the organisation’s secretary general, also told Russia to stop engaging in “nuclear sabre-rattling” and repeated warnings that the Kremlin could be seeking “a pretext” for using chemical weapon as the war heads into a second month. In other developments: US is expected to announce a new package of Russia sanctions on Thursday, targeting politicians and oligarchs. More Russian banks and state enterprises may also be added to a blacklist, cutting them off from using the Belgium-based Swift financial messaging system. Nato announced it will double its troops along the alliance’s eastern flank, beginning the deployment of four new battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. On the eve of a meeting with Biden, European Union nations signed off on another €500m ($550m) in military aid for Ukraine. UK will double the number of missiles it sends to Ukraine and urge western allies to step up provisions of lethal aid to the country. Boris Johnson said the UK would provide 6,000 new defensive missiles, including high-explosive weapons, and £25m from Foreign Office funds to help Ukraine pay its military and police forces. In his late-night address, flitting between Ukrainian and Russian, Zelenskiy said the past month had been “long” but hailed Ukrainian resistance that has been much more ferocious than Russia expected and would endure for as long as it takes. “This is a war for independence and we must win,” he said. “We will rebuild every city, we will bring the invaders to justice for every crime,” he said. “All our people will live in a free Ukraine.”",News/World news,Ukraine war: Zelenskiy urges global protests ‘in the name of peace’ to mark month since invasion began,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/ukraine-war-zelenskiy-urges-global-protests-in-the-name-of-peace-to-mark-month-since-invasion-began
3/24/2022,"A century ago, small orchards were the glory not only of the countryside but of towns and cities across the UK, buzzing with life during the summer and, at this time of year, rich with the sight and scent of blossom. But research released as this spring’s blossom sweeps across the UK has found there are 80% fewer small “traditional” orchards, which are regarded as particularly important for flora and fauna, in England and Wales compared with in 1900. Even taking into account large commercial concerns, which are not as ecologically rich, the two countries have lost more than half of all orchard space since then. According to a report from the National Trust, the south-west of England is one of the regions hardest hit, with the area of orchards that have vanished equating to almost twice the size of the city of Bristol. There have been dramatic losses in the north of England, where declines of about 80% have been found. As cities and towns have expanded, they have lost most of their orchards, with London having only 3% left and Cheltenham in Gloucestershire 1%. In urban areas, orchards have mostly been lost to housing and other types of development, while in the countryside they have been uprooted to create more farmland, the report says. Kent is the English county that has the highest total coverage today but this is because of the number of large commercial orchards rather than the speckling of traditional, more nature-filled ones. The decline along the English and Welsh border has been less steep than in other regions. Tom Dommett, the head of historic environment at the National Trust, said that for centuries orchards were a defining feature of neighbourhoods, part of the fabric of everyday life. He said: “Their loss affects local culture, how we all experience landscapes, and it means fewer opportunities for people to enjoy the beauty and spectacle of blossom.” Traditional orchards are defined as sites with at least five trees managed in a low-intensity way, the floor grazed or mowed with little or no chemical input. Dommett continued: “The loss of traditional orchards is also nature’s loss; these orchards can be great places for wildlife like flies and bees, with the gnarled trunks and branches creating the perfect home for rare species.” The first Covid lockdown two years ago prompted the conservation charity to launch its first “blossom watch” campaign, encouraging people to look out for and share images of blossom. It is stepping up its drive this year, trying to inspire a British version of the Japanese blossom celebration, hanami. But it has also undertaken in-depth research to find out how many orchards are left. The trust used a firm specialising in artificial intelligence to compare orchards in England and Wales marked on Ordnance Survey maps from the turn of the 20th century with modern OS maps, data from People’s Trust for Endangered Species and Natural England. The National Trust has committed to planting 4m blossom trees in England, Wales and Northern Ireland by 2030 and to set up more traditional orchards on its land. John Deakin, the head of trees and woodland at the trust, said: “Traditional orchards and the blossom they bring creates valuable early nectar sources for insects which are often foraging for scarce resources in the early spring. “These native, historic varieties, together with other trees like blackthorn and hawthorn which also have amazing spring blossom, mature at a faster rate than other larger native species such as oak. They provide an important bridge for insects that rely on their particular ecosystems which is one of the reasons why planting more blossom trees is such a vital part of our ambitions.” One of the projects being launched this year is a scheme to bring more orchard trees into Birmingham, once known as a city “ringed with blossom”. In Birmingham in 1900 there were 186 hectares (460 acres) of orchards, compared with 29 today. As part of the Birmingham 2022 festival, a six-month celebration of creativity around the 2022 Commonwealth Games, the trust is creating two pop-up blossom gardens in the city centre and is to recreate a symbolic ring of new trees around Birmingham planted on the 27-mile No 11 outer circle bus route.",News/Environment,Blossom falls: 80% of small orchards in England and Wales lost since 1900,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/24/blossom-falls-80-of-small-orchards-in-england-and-wales-lost-since-1900
3/24/2022,"It’s regarded as one of the greatest British television dramas of all time, launching the early careers of its stars Daniel Craig, Christopher Eccleston, Gina McKee and Mark Strong. But while it was set in the mid-60s to 90s, the storylines of politics, corruption and class prevalent in Our Friends in the North are just as relevant today, its writer has said ahead of a new radio adaptation. “Nothing has changed since then,” Peter Flannery said. “We have corrupt politicians, locally and nationally, we have a corrupt police force. We’re still chucking out houses for poor people to live in, which turn out to be deathtraps. Pornography has got worse, the attacks on women have got worse.” Flannery, 70, wrote Our Friends in the North as a stage play when he was in his 20s and working as a writer-in-residence at the Royal Shakespeare Company. The TV adaptation – which cost £8m to make, half of BBC2’s drama serials budget for a year – was beset with legal problems because of similarities to real-life politicians and businesspeople. It was eventually broadcast on BBC2 in 1996, when Flannery was 44, and hailed as a landmark show that combined the personal and political. The storyline follows four friends over three decades against a backdrop of political, corporate and police corruption, shoddy housing scandals, the 1970s porn empires, the 1980s miners’ strike and the rise of New Labour in the 1990s. Flannery has called it a “posh soap opera”, not unlike the work of Shakespeare, where love, tragedy and politics combine to produce big storylines full of emotion. “And that still works,” he said. “Young people falling in love, then falling out of love and betraying each other; parents growing old, the onset of dementia; the disintegration of communities in the north. All of that I could be writing about today.” Born in Jarrow, south Tyneside, Flannery said he was inspired to write the play by his parents, who “were cynical about the political process in England much more than I was. The first thing they talked about was corruption.” “Not long before that there had been a lot of corruption scandals centred in the north-east, around T Dan Smith [then leader of Newcastle city council],” he added. “So I rang Smith and said: ‘Look, I’m thinking about writing a play about corruption in British public life, and he said: ‘Well there’s a play here of Shakespearean proportions’.” Once he began researching the subject, he says it was like “dropping a pebble into a pond, the ripples just went out”. For Flannery, one of the clearest examples of continuity can found in the Metropolitan police. His show looked at the attempt to clean up the Met in 1970, “when a guy called Frank Williamson was brought in to head an outside inquiry for the very first time. It utterly failed. He wrote a very good report and put it on the desk of the home secretary, Reginald Maudling, and it was back on his desk within the hour without a single mark on it. That rings a few bells. “So it’s no surprise to me to find pockets of corrupt detectives today, murdering women in London and dealing in pornography. Because nothing has changed.” On Tuesday, a report by the policing inspectorate found the Met’s ability to tackle corruption was “fundamentally flawed”. While this and other things remain woefully familiar, much has also changed in the north-east since Flannery penned the show, including the concept of a “red wall”. “The north was pretty much solid Labour territory,” he said. “It was tribal. But that changed because New Labour blurred the distinction. It became all right to vote Tory because Blair turned Labour into a kind of progressive Tory party anyway, and then lied his way into a disastrous war, which he’s still defending.” There are indeed lines that can be drawn from that period to recent developments, including the Brexit vote and a backlash against political elites. “The 60s were unusual because people did get charged and go to prison, like T Dan Smith, John Poulson and Andrew Cunningham. That hardly ever happens now,” Flannery said. “People haven’t really paid a price. You tend not to get caught in this country, and you tend not to have to pay a hefty price if you do get caught, unless you’re poor. What will be outcome of all the Downing Street parties? Are you expecting mass imprisonment or fines? I’m not.” The Radio 4 adaptation, which begins on Thursday, includes a 10th episode, penned by writer Adam Usden, which takes the main characters’ stories up to the year 2020. Flannery has not seen or discussed the final episode with Usden. “I think there might be two audiences,” he says. “A new one, which will find it very relevant, and an old one who will remember the characters they spent so much time with. I wish I had a pound for every time someone has said to me they felt like real people by the end.”",Arts/Television & radio,"Our Friends in the North still depressingly relevant, says writer",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/24/our-friends-in-the-north-writer-peter-flannery-radio-4
3/24/2022,"As Britain slowly emerges from the pandemic, after two bruising years, Covid camps are one of the lasting legacies. What I mean by Covid camps are people or groups with particular pandemic positions taken early on that they then continually reinforce by selectively sourcing information, eventually building a base of followers that organise around that position and defend it viciously. It’s unsurprising: similar camps developed around Brexit and other key issues. However, the emergence of scientists also dividing themselves into camps over Covid is more novel. These camps include those who have always compared Covid to seasonal flu and advocated a “let it rip” approach; those who have argued for maximum suppression (and still do); and those who have changed their stance based on emerging data, including around vaccines and variants. There are also camps for those who have always been against masks, noting the lack of evidence over effectiveness; those who have argued for masks regardless of age and context; and those who analyse their cost and benefit in different situations and age groups. The essence of science is asking questions, forming hypotheses for possible answers, and then revising these based on new data. Covid has been a constantly changing situation. One only has to look at the emergence of variants and how policy response had to modify with a steep rise in Delta cases – which was more severe than the original Sars-CoV-2 – and then again with Omicron (which is milder than previous variants). There were also early hypotheses suggesting that many people may have prior immunity from other coronaviruses against Sars-CoV-2. The pandemic has been like seeing something coming through the fog – but being unsure of the contours or exact characteristics of what was approaching. Humility and flexibility in responding were two hallmarks of effective policy response. For example, delaying infections through pursuing maximum suppression or a zero-Covid response were optimal in a pre-vaccine, pre-antiviral era. Every infection averted was giving someone a chance to have access to scientific tools – and live many more healthy years of life. Early in the pandemic we also didn’t understand the full impact of the virus and so had to take a more cautious approach. “Living with Covid”, now that science has largely defanged it, involves ensuring widespread vaccination, as well as creating schemes such as the US government’s “test to treat”. The latter involves Americans going to pharmacies to get tested for Covid and if positive, immediately receiving antivirals on the spot, free of charge. Testing, treatments and vaccines mean that governments can find their “exit” from the pandemic and manage Covid as another one of the many infectious diseases they have to deal with. But instead of evolving their position based on new data, some, instead, keep trying to show how they were still right in early 2020, digging themselves an even deeper hole. A case in point is Stanford professor John Ioannidis, who, in March 2020, argued that governments were overreacting to the threat of Covid. He mocked those who worried that the “68 deaths from Covid-19 in the US as of 16 March will increase exponentially to 680, 6,800, 68,000, 680,000”. He estimated that the US might suffer only 10,000 deaths. He also was cynical that vaccines or treatments could be developed in any timeframe that would affect the trajectory of the pandemic. Two years later, the current US death toll stands at 969,000, with almost 250,000 of those being people under 65. These numbers would have once been seen as outlandish. In addition, in less than a year we had developed safe and effective vaccines – and a year after that, safe and effective antivirals. One would expect these facts to prompt an academic to reconsider their initial assumptions – but instead, Ioannidis has continued to publish articles solidifying his starting position. Why is this the case? Why can’t academics just admit that they might have got their assumptions wrong at the start, or reassess their positions? I think it’s a mix of playing to a fanbase that has formed over two years (in this case, an anti-lockdown, “Covid-as-flu” base), and the idea that moving with new data is a sign of backtracking and weakness, instead of the basic scientific virtue of reflection and re-analysis. The overall need is to be proven “right” for oneself and a small group of followers, rather than right for society. Governments (and the public) have expected scientists to be oracles who can predict the future – and have put them in the spotlight in a previously unusual way. Social and mainstream media have amplified extreme positions – for the sake of debate and the impulse to show “two sides” – instead of trying to find a sensible middle ground. The move in society and workplaces towards largely virtual communication during the pandemic has made this polarisation even worse, with so many primarily communicating via Zoom and social media platforms. In this way, extreme positions have received disproportionate exposure in comparison to the “silent majority” who seem to understand the complexity of the situation – and the need to rely on expertise grounded in data. I have respect and admiration for scientists who have admitted what they got wrong, and also understand that each stage of the pandemic has required a different response, based on the latest data, tools and analysis. “Experts” and influential people stuck in these Covid camps continue to influence the narrative. In some ways, this keeps us stuck reliving and relitigating arguments from early in the pandemic at the very moment we should be focused on the best evidence and policies to help us “exit” the pandemic safely. This should involve the equitable distribution of vaccines and therapeutics around the globe, protecting those vulnerable to severe disease and rapid-response public health plans based around surveillance. In these moments it’s important to remember the two principles of humility and flexibility in response – and how these don’t fit easily with the new world of media.

3/24/2022,"‘Why does nobody ever talk about Grimsby central library?” asks Owen Hatherley with an air of mild outrage. “How is it not famous? It’s a fabulous little building, with chandeliers, mosaics, public sculpture, a wonderful double-height reading room. It’s a fantastic place but it’s not listed. It’s never ever mentioned.” Hatherley stumbled upon the little concrete jewel box, which was built in 1968 by JM Milner for the Grimsby borough architects department, while researching his latest book, a hefty 600-page gazetteer of Modern Buildings in Britain. Entering the classically inspired block of prefabricated concrete panels, under a sculptural honeycomb grid ceiling, he found a world of swirling mosaics and abstract tapestries illuminated by chic 1960s lighting in clustered tubes – a pristine example of “civic design of the highest order” in this neglected northern town. It is one of many such unexpected entries in the book, which roams voraciously from Aberystwyth to Aberdeen in search of those remarkable everyday products of the modern movement that are often hiding in plain sight. The famous favourites are all in there too, from Lasdun and Goldfinger to the New Towns, given entertaining new appraisals in Hatherley’s characteristically bolshie prose. But there are new finds for even the most hardcore concrete caressers. “I didn’t want the book to be about iconic buildings,” says Hatherley, “the way people tend to look at modern architecture as being about great objects in big cities, thanks to the cult of brutalism. For a start, most of the iconic architecture we’ve got in this country is not very good. Famous architects have very seldom done their best work here. Often the most interesting stuff is the more mundane.” When he was first approached by Penguin to write the guide, he thought he could probably do it in a year. It sounds about right for the prolific 40-year-old, who has published 14 books to date, several of which have covered similar ground. But it ended up growing into a six-year project. He began by combing through Pevsner guides, back issues of the Modernist and C20 Magazine, and trawling Instagram feeds before criss-crossing the country by train and bus, with occasional lifts from friends and family who drive. The aim was not an exhaustive, scholarly documentation of modernism in Britain but an approachable guide to accessible, or at least visible, things to go and see. “I tried to find a decent modern building in every settlement in the country, which was really quite gruelling,” he says. “The idea was that everywhere probably does have one or two good modern buildings – even Reading. No matter whether you’re in Scunthorpe or Chandlers Ford or East Kilbride, there should be something interesting that you can go and look at.” The one building he singles out in Reading is the university’s school of construction management and engineering, designed by Howell Killick Partridge & Amis in 1973, known locally as the Lego building for its kit-of-parts look. In Hatherley’s eyes, it is “the Katsura Palace in coloured concrete”. It is an addictive book to dip in and out of, to open at random to learn something new. In Preston, as well as the once threatened, now cherished bus station, you can find the Plastic Classroom at Kennington Road primary school, a faceted white dome built in 1974 that looks more like something from a Kubrick film set than a municipal architects’ department. In Swansea, Hatherley finds “one of the most admirable examples of civic brutalism in Britain,” in the form of the 1980s civic centre – which is currently slated for demolition, like a good number of buildings in the book. Shetland, meanwhile, turns out to be a site of some remarkably progressive public housing, with colourful eco-friendly homes designed by Richard Gibson that seem more akin to what you might find in Norway. Like its cousins across the water, Hatherley notes, Shetland has used its oil revenue to build a Scandi-style social democratic state-within-a-state, with great public buildings and attractive social housing. He steers clear of politics as far as possible but the overarching message is clear: the best modern architecture is always the product of a strong welfare state. “There are certain points at which the rest of the country outside London just disappears from serious architecture,” he says. “And the reason is always the same: at each point, whether it’s the 1920s and 30s or the 1980s and 90s, or the last 10 years, you have a Conservative government that doesn’t give a shit about the rest of the country and lets them die.” He begins his introduction – which is possibly the most lucid and concise history of modern architecture in Britain you will find anywhere – at the St Mary’s estate in Woolwich, south London; a typical product of 1950s council housing where he lived when he began writing the book. You wouldn’t normally give it a second look. With brown brick walls and shallow pitched roofs dotted with chimneys, it exemplifies “people’s detailing” – a waspish term, Hatherley explains in a handy glossary, used for the sort of communist-aligned, Swedish-influenced, picturesque modernism of the decade after the second world war. But modern architecture in Britain, he writes, is all about places like this. No matter how mundane they may seem, they are expressions of a revolutionary approach to who builds in the city, how they build and in whose interest. Many of Hatherley’s opinions, on both aesthetics and politics, will be familiar to readers who know his work, but there are some surprising, unpredictable judgments. While he is mostly full of contempt for postmodernism (“the ‘funny tie’ in the Brooks Brothers corporate cityscape”), he finds a lot to love in the eccentric buildings of Alan Short, whose “riotous” 1990s university projects, which writhe with clashing materials and wayward ventilation towers, are “packed with thrills and spills”. Hatherley is also partial to the polychrome excess of John Outram, particularly the Judge Institute, which he calls “a ridiculous and exhilarating ride, Thatcherite sci-fi, and the most gleefully tasteless building in Cambridge.” Similarly, you might expect Hatherley to have nothing but scorn for the “pseudomodernism” of the New Labour era, but he loves much of Will Alsop’s work, applauding the “mastery of monumentality” of his hulking Palestra office block in Southwark, London. He is also an unlikely fan of Norman Foster’s globular Sage concert hall in Gateshead, and finds lots to admire in Kengo Kuma’s colossal V&A Dundee, which he thinks is “wholly of its place” and full of “smart and subtle ideas” inside. Elsewhere, he is refreshingly honest about his love-hate relationship with certain structures: the Shard skyscraper in London is “a shocker” at street level but, by night, its eerie silhouette is “a sinister and glowering masterwork”. With the aim of producing a guide of things worth going to see, Hatherley says he hasn’t included anything he hates, although there are plenty of entertaining swipes at nearby structures. While praising the Charles Street car park in Sheffield he condemns the Conran-designed St Paul’s Tower alongside as “pitifully underdesigned … an utterly trivial piss-weak extruded grid of brown luxury flats”. In Manchester he finds the Beetham Tower to be the only work by Ian Simpson worth naming, compared to his other towers that exhibit an “unfortunate combination of over-slick glass gloop and a fumbling approach to form”. Pretty much every recent tower in the city could be demolished tomorrow, adds the author, without anyone missing them. It’s true. Given the current state of contemporary construction in Britain, it’s not hard to see why Hatherley prefers to dwell on the products of more enlightened times. Is he optimistic about the current direction of architecture on these isles? “No,” he says bluntly. “But the thing that’s wrong with British architecture isn’t to do with style or fashion, it’s to do with the fact that everything here is incredibly badly built, thanks to a procurement culture based on the endless deferring of risk. It’s evident in the Grenfell inquiry: there were dozens of contractors, just to refurbish a tower block, with labyrinthine contracts to ensure there was no risk to those companies. The first thing that’s always driven down is quality – and people have died because of it. Until we get rid of PFI [private finance initiative], and something is done to raise the quality of mass housing, schools and hospitals, I don’t have much hope for British architecture.”  Modern Buildings in Britain: A Gazetteer by Owen Hatherley is published by Penguin on 7 April.",Arts/Art and design,Like something from a Kubrick film – the hunt for Britain’s best modern buildings,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/24/something-kubrick-britain-best-modern-building-owen-hatherley
3/24/2022,"Women and child refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine to Poland are being targeted by suspected pimps and sex traffickers operating alone and in gangs, according to charities working on the border. “We’ve registered the first cases of [suspected] pimps preying on Ukrainian women near refugee shelter points in Lublin; accosting them, sometimes aggressively, under the guise of offering transport, work or accommodation,” said Karolina Wierzbińska, a coordinator at Homo Faber, a human rights organisation based in the Polish city of Lublin. “These are not only men,” she said. “There are also women attempting to procure female refugees at bus stations.” Wierzbińska said there had also been teams of people working together to try to lure women into unidentified cars. “[We see teams] waiting for people arriving from Ukraine and pretending to offer rides or lodging to women distressed and exhausted from their journey,” she said. “We’re also seeing multiple couples, typically a male and a female, having travelled to the border by car, attempting to lure women using similar tactics. We intervene in such cases by approaching the person acting suspiciously and asking them to register in our volunteer directory – in response to which they typically run away.” Since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, the Polish army – along with firefighters and police – have been on the border at Medyka, Poland’s busiest crossing with Ukraine, to organise and assist the thousands of refugees arriving every day. The past few weeks have also seen the arrival of groups of men in military fatigues who claim to be there to protect women and children crossing the borders after aid organisations expressed fears that the refugee crisis would spark a wave of trafficking and exploitation. Earlier this week, one such group of foreigners in camouflage could be seen unloading aid donations in a Medyka car park. But the men, who slept in the car park in tents in sub-zero temperatures, are not Polish soldiers. Instead, they identified themselves as veterans of the French Foreign Legion. The men said they had travelled thousands of miles to fill what they see as a dangerous vacuum in protecting women and children fleeing the war in Ukraine from trafficking. “I couldn’t even focus, because that could have been my sister, my daughter,” said one individual attached to the vigilante group, who asked not to be identified but showed what appeared to be French Foreign Legion ID papers in his passport. “I think nothing’s being controlled,” he said. “I’ve seen women who are scared, and kids are showing up at the border and no one knows where the parents are. It’s such an easy target.” Nearly a month into the war, security at Medyka is still precarious. Police on site have had a larger presence in recent days, to check the identity of volunteers and drivers offering lifts to refugees, but a huge number of cars pass without being stopped. “The issue with human trafficking is that most of the transports that happen are not organised. They are volunteers who arrive from all kinds of places in their private cars. So at all the reception points, you have different organisations trying to set up a system of tracing and tracking,” said one Polish Red Cross volunteer, who asked to speak anonymously in order to be candid. A spokesperson for the local police said they had no information about the vigilante group or their intentions, but denied there were any foreign soldiers at the border. Volunteers at other refugee reception centres have also seen men in military uniforms unaffiliated with any official authority. On top of an already chaotic mix of aid groups, authorities and local volunteers, the arrival of individuals in military clothing creates confusion over who the official security forces are at the border points – a situation that helps traffickers, experts point out. Many of the men refused to answer questions about their presence at the border. One individual, who had a French flag on his uniform, kept his face partly covered by a black neck gaiter and refused to give his name or explain his purpose at the border, only saying that he was there “to help”. All the men refused to be photographed. Unicef, one of the aid groups working in Poland, said unvetted individuals acting in isolation from the Polish authorities were a concern. “I can’t speak for the authorities in Poland … [but] security is effectively their domain,” said Joe English, a Unicef spokesperson. “I think any kind of vigilantism is an unnerving development.” More than 3 million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion. Charities working at the border have said the increasing desperation of the women and children who are crossing over, many of whom have nowhere to go, has coincided with the appearance of suspected traffickers and sexual predators. Ylva Johansson, EU commissioner for home affairs, said this week that there had been reports from aid groups of women disappearing and that the European Commission had launched a network of anti-trafficking coordinators. “We should not wait until we have proof of a lot of trafficking, because then it might be too late,” she said. Missing Children Europe, an umbrella group for 24 child-protection organisations across Europe, told the Guardian that unaccompanied minors were continuing to disappear at the borders. “There are so many children […] that we lost track of,” said Aagje Ieven, secretary general of Missing Children Europe. “This is a huge problem, not just because it means they easily go missing, and are difficult to find, but also because it makes trafficking so easy.” According to Unicef, more than 500 unaccompanied children were identified crossing from Ukraine into Romania between 24 February and 17 March. It is one of several organisations that has called for improvements to screening at borders to keep children, particularly unaccompanied ones, safe.",News/Global development,Vigilantes stalk Ukraine border as sex traffickers target fleeing women and children,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/24/vigilantes-stalk-ukraine-border-as-sex-traffickers-target-fleeing-women-and-children
3/24/2022,"‘I’ve just been sick behind the curtain.” It’s an inauspicious start to a gig. But Lou Sanders is not very well and, being Lou Sanders, isn’t keeping the fact to herself. That makes for an anxious opening five minutes, with an audience uncertain whether to laugh at Sanders or call her a doctor. Happily, she rallies to deliver a tight hour about her life during the pandemic and the relative attractions of those two competing impulses, love and fear. It is characteristic Sanders territory: she’s telling tales about her rackety life, and psychoanalysing them as she does so. Tonight’s tale is not especially eventful: it’s about Sanders, 36 and seven years single, taking up roller skating and falling for a 26-year-old. We might wish for a more dramatic narrative arc, but there’s no denying that our host – with her compulsive self-scrutiny and heightened sense of her own daftness – makes her story a pleasant way to pass the time. By way of structure, we get readings from what Sanders introduces as her “skate diary”, which recounts her visits to skate parks in Enfield and beyond. Between these, she recounts her lockdown experiences, volunteering as an NHS responder (cue much amusing self-congratulation), visiting her mum and stepdad, and losing herself in New Age “woo-woo”. As often with Sanders, these routines flow into one another, powered by our host’s nervous energy and not always giving punctuation points or punchlines the space they deserve. There’s no shortage of the latter, including a precious one about paedophiles and a choice line about her prejudice against twentysomethings. Just as often, it’s Sanders’ personality making us laugh: this is a woman who’s high maintenance to herself, even as she alchemises her failures and malfunctions into gold-star self-regard. The show malfunctions too, in that (sickness notwithstanding) her story comes to a burbled conclusion and her ideas about love and fear are barely developed.

3/24/2022,"Eight-year-old chocolate labrador, Blue, is shaped like a barrel and has a slow, lumbering gait. Rolls of fat bulge from his collar; his belly hangs low, skimming the ground. Mournful eyes look out from a jowly face. Blue is on a diet, you see, and he’s hating every minute of it. No more juicy rabbit ears or plump chicken feet. He sneaked some cake earlier in the week from the kitchen floor, but his owner, Mary, got it away before he could finish it. “I hate this bit,” groans Mary*, as Blue thunks on to the scales at the Pet Health and Therapy Centre in Welling, south-east London. “It’s like Weight Watchers.” Ideally, Blue should weigh no more than 36kg. The scales creak: 47.1kg. “He’s gone up again,” sighs Mary, who has requested anonymity because she is embarrassed. “My son and daughter are really skinny,” she says in a pleading tone. “People think I starve my children but overfeed my animals.” A 39-year-old dog walker from Mottingham, south-east London, Mary says that Blue is on a calorie-controlled diet and regularly walked. “He goes on walks all the time!” she says, pulling up her phone to show me photos of Blue hulking over her clients’ dogs. Sometimes, members of the public come up to Mary at work and tell her that she’s got to let Blue’s owner know he needs to lose weight. “I am the owner,” she responds. Reluctantly, Blue is led into a hydrotherapy tank for his weekly session. “The water reduces the pressure on his joints,” says 23-year-old veterinary physiotherapist Miranda Cosstick, “and places less stress on the hips.” When Blue began training in November 2021, he could only manage 10 seconds on the underwater treadmill. Now, he is up to 45 seconds, even if he has regained the weight he initially lost. The treadmill whirrs. Blue stares out glumly from the warm lapping water. Cosstick waves a dog treat in front of him, and he lunges forward and tries to get it out of her hand. “You have to taunt him with it,” says Cosstick, “to get him to move.” But this is not animal abuse, whatever Blue’s plaintive eyes might suggest. Already, Blue is arthritic and finds it painful to walk. If he doesn’t lose weight, he is likely to die young from obesity-related complications. And he is not alone. Fuller-figured pets are, increasingly, a mainstay of UK homes. “We’ve seen an increased prevalence of obesity in both dogs and cats for a long time,” says Prof Alex German of the University of Liverpool. The PDSA animal charity reports that 78% of veterinary professionals have seen an increase in pet obesity in recent years, with obesity rated as one of the top five welfareproblems for UK pet owners. Many owners don’t realise the health consequences of their pets being overweight. Only 69% of those the PDSA surveyed agreed that overweight pets were more likely to suffer from serious diseases. “They’re more likely to suffer problems with mobility, arthritis, diabetes, respiratory problems and problems with their urinary systems,” says German. Overweight dogs may die two-and-a-half years earlier than their non-obese peers. But Kitty Thanki is not one of those members of the public in denial about the damaging effects of pet obesity. “I’m a doctor,” says the 35-year-old, from Camden, north London, “which is one of the ironies of having a fat dog.” Her seven-year-old pomeranian, George, looks like an overstuffed draft excluder. He weighs 6.5kg; ideally, he should weigh no more than 4.5kg. “He is greedy,” says Thanki. “He raids the bin. He eats the cats’ food.” During lockdown, George’s weight went up to 7.1kg. “My mum came to stay with me,” says Thanki, “and that’s where it all escalated. She feeds him human food, even though I tell her not to. She says it’s only a little bit, but she doesn’t realise the calorific impact of a slice of toast on a dog that’s so small.” George’s story is not uncommon. The UK’s pet obesity crisis has been exacerbated by the pandemic. Five per cent of cat owners, and 9% of dog owners, reported that their pets had gained weight since the March 2020 lockdown, with 1.4 million pets being fed more human treats during this time. “Being at home has made owners more likely to give pets a little bit of what they’re having,” says PDSA vet Lynne James. “It’s easy to do, when they’re sat there, looking at you.” George has an Instagram account with 2,418 followers (@littlefatcockney), which Thanki initially set up to document his “weight loss journey”, to use the terminology of diet groups across the world. But the algorithm does not want George to become more streamlined. “When he looks the most rotund,” says Thanki, “he gets the most likes.” Thanki understands this impulse, even if she’d much rather have no likes, and a healthy dog. “I’m probably just as guilty of looking at fat animals online and thinking, they are so cute,” she says. Thanki is referring to the pervasive internet trend for videos and photos of obese animals, often referred to as “chonky”, “thicc”, and “absolute units”. The most popular Instagram accounts have hundreds of thousands of followers, who like videos of obese cats getting trapped in cat flaps and struggling to climb on chairs. Some even sell merchandise, including dog backpacks, so owners can carry obese animals that are too unfit to walk. “The internet is part of the problem,” says James. “It’s normalising the appearance of these animals being overweight. If all you see is overweight pets, you start to think that’s normal. Pets that are a healthy weight start to appear skinny in comparison.” The best way to check whether your animal is overweight is to take them to a vet, but owners can also assess them at home. “Run your fingers loosely over their torso,” says James, “and see whether you can feel their ribs and spine. You should be able to feel them with minimal pressure. You should also see a waistline that tucks in when you’re looking at them from the side.” I text James photographs of my two pet cats, Kedi and Larry, for professional assessment. “I’d want to put my hands on them to feel sure,” she says, “but they look good. I’d use them in a PDSA campaign as an example of healthy-looking cats.” I flush with pride. The most important thing, says German, is not to berate owners. “Obesity is a highly stigmatised condition,” he says. “There’s a lot of fat-shaming out there. You could argue: well, cats and dogs don’t know you’re making fun of them. But you’re potentially shaming the owners, and that leads to blame, and the problem with blame is that it gets in the way of good obesity care.” Thanki has experienced this casual judgment. “Strangers have come up to me and said: ‘Your dog is really fat,’” she says. “Once, my partner was carrying George at an event so he wouldn’t get stepped on and a woman said: ‘He’s got legs, you know. Oh wait, maybe he doesn’t, because he’s so fat.’’’ Celia Deakin, a 40-year-old teacher from Edinburgh, knows this stigma all too well. “I do feel guilty,” she says. “I would like him to be healthy.” Deakin is attempting to lose weight herself and says that when she takes her 13-year-old moggy Marlowe to the vet, she feels judged. “It’s shameful,” says Deakin, “to be overweight yourself and holding an overweight cat and saying: ‘I swear he doesn’t eat that much.’” Deakin describes Marlowe, who weighs 7.4kg, as “an absolute unit” and a “giant puma”. “Not in a Rubenesque way,” she adds. “He’s just a big, massive chunk.” When Marlowe jumps off the bed, says Deakin, “it sounds like a cannonball hitting the ground.” Like George, Marlowe piled on the pounds during lockdown, when Deakin would feed him treats to stop him whining while she was teaching classes on Zoom. But, over the past year, she’s been on a mission to drop his weight, after the vet diagnosed him with arthritis. “I did this really intense diet where I ignored all his wails for food,” says Deakin, “and put him on special satiety food [calorie-controlled to help animals stay fuller for longer]. He lost literally a gram.” Deakin is at a loss. She doesn’t believe he’s stealing her other cat’s food, and she isn’t overfeeding him. She wonders if he’s just naturally big boned. “Dieting can be a challenge,” says German, “and it’s best done in conjunction with a vet.” He advises owners to put their animals on high-quality satiety food, which is nutrient-dense. “Always weigh the food on a scale,” says German, “and minimise treats as much as possible.” When animals start begging for food, German advises giving them low-calorie snacks, such as slices of cooked courgette. “Often,” says German, “when the animal is whining, what it’s really craving is that sense of attention and reward. But there are other things you can do to reward your pets. Take the dog for a walk. Groom your cat.” The best efforts of owners can be undone by our food-centric treat culture, and a lack of general awareness about the dangers of pet obesity. Deakin suspects that Marlowe is finding food outside: either the neighbours are feeding him, or he is hunting his own food. Thanki has had members of the public feed George from their picnics. “One man in St James’s Park gave him an entire packet of ham,” she says. “The man said: ‘Oh don’t worry, I don’t mind.’ I said: ‘I mind!’” But there are also members of the public actively trying to undo the bad habits of their fellow pet owners. “I monitor their weight six times a week,” says Anna Talbot of the 37 gerbils in her care. Talbot, a 44-year-old cleaner and renovator from Staffordshire, runs an unofficial shelter from her house. “I haven’t got a home any more,” she says. “I have 16 tanks around the house. Six in my bedroom, six in my spare room, and four in the back room.” Talbot specifically seeks out what she describes as “sad gerbils”, meaning gerbils who tend to be overweight or obese, and are being kept in small cages. She takes them home and puts them on diets. She rescued Jake in 2021, when he weighed 113g. “He was absolutely depressed,” she says. “All he would do is just shovel food in.” Jake was initially too fat to climb the stairs in Talbot’s house, but she would coax him up. “Give him that encouragement,” she says. “He lost a gram here and a gram there.” In a few months, Talbot got Jake down to a much healthier 80g. But her efforts came too late. She found blood in his urine. She thinks it was related to his obesity. As it was a weekend, her vet wouldn’t do a home visit. “He lay next to me all night,” says Talbot in a strangled voice. “He was in agony. He was looking at me, just lying there. Half an hour before he passed, he walked up to me and Eskimo-kissed me. He knew I was there for him.” She says it was the worst experience of her gerbil-keeping life. “I’ve lost gerbils before,” she says. “I trod on a gerbil and killed him. It was awful. I have flashbacks. But Jake was different, because he was such a beautiful little soul.” Despite her loss, Talbot is undeterred in her efforts to rescue obese gerbils. When we speak, she has just finished weighing Ethan, a gerbil she rehomed 10 days ago. He weighed 103g when she got him; now he is down to 88g (he should weigh around 80g). “They were chuckling at how fat he was in the pet shop,” Talbot recalls. “Saying: ‘Oh my God, I’ve never seen such a fat gerbil!’ I couldn’t wait to get him out. If you hit an animal, it would be animal cruelty. Obesity is the same. They can’t decide for themselves. You need to take the upper hand, give them a good diet and exercise.” Most experts agree, however, that overfeeding is not wilful animal abuse. “People aren’t doing this from the wrong point of view,” says James. “They’re doing it because they love their pets and think they are doing the right thing. I hesitate to call it cruelty, especially when you have a pet that is really motivated by food, and acts as if they are hungry, even when they are not.” Thanki is charitable about her mother’s habit of feeding toast to the dog. “A lot of it is cultural,” she says. “I’m from an Indian background. When I went to my nan’s house when I was a child, I would always be bursting when I left. It’s ingrained, that idea that feeding someone means they’re loved.” But there is such a thing as loving someone to death – particularly when they are an adorable animal with a taste for treats, and a petulant whine. Owners of obese pets can take comfort that most bad habits can be undone, with discipline, underwater treadmills – and the odd chunk of courgette. *Some names have been changed.",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘He raids the bin and eats the cat’s food!’ – the dangerous rise in obese pets,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/24/he-raids-the-bin-and-eats-the-cats-food-the-dangerous-rise-in-obese-pets
3/24/2022,"A bilateral trade deal between the US and the UK is “desirable” but will not progress while the Northern Ireland peace deal is being used for domestic political purposes, one of the most powerful American congressmen has warned. Richard Neal, the chairman of the ways and means committee, has told the Guardian: “We will not entertain a trade agreement if there is any jeopardy to the Good Friday agreement. “A bilateral trade agreement with the UK is desirable – there’s no question about that. I’m very open to that. But what I’m not open to is holding the Good Friday agreement hostage over domestic politics.” Neal, who has taken a keen interest in Northern Ireland over the past three decades, is a key figure in US trade deals and negotiated the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. His committee writes trade bills and without its support a deal will not be approved. In an exclusive interview from Washington, he denounced those who say the Brexit deal has killed the Good Friday agreement on the grounds that unionists did not consent to the arrangements negotiated with the EU. “We are concerned that the protocol is being used to hold the Good Friday agreement hostage,” he said. “The argument being applied by some is reckless and demagogic.” Neal’s comments come a day after the US trade minister Katherine Tai dashed hopes of any imminent post-Brexit free-trade deal, saying an agreement was not worth spending “years and a lot of blood, sweat and tears” over. Neal said he had personal reassurances from both the Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis last week and Boris Johnson on a recent trip to Washington that there was no desire to jeopardise the Good Friday agreement. While he went “back and forth” with Lewis, Neal said he had a “good meeting” and they both agreed it was “not healthy for political parties to suspend government when they disagree on legislative detail”, a reference to a recent decision by the DUP to pull the first minister out of the Stormont executive. Neal confirmed that he has considered leading an American delegation to Dublin and London to reinforce his message about the peace deal and stability in Northern Ireland. He said the peace deal was precious, hard-won and should be celebrated as a template for negotiations around the world with significant compromises on both sides paving the way for long-term peace. “Two generations of children have grown up in a different atmosphere than what the north looked like 30 years ago. “I think we need to remind everybody of the risks and the chances that were taken by all parties to get to the Good Friday agreement. We should be celebrating it as a template for the world order.” He pointed out that in the referendum south of the border the Republic of Ireland agreed to change articles two and three of the constitution, which laid claim to the six counties in Northern Ireland, while the UK relinquished the hard border. “The last thing we want to do is jeopardise that spectacular agreement,” he said. The dispute over Northern Ireland was “one of the longest in the history of the western world” said Neal, and “we came up with an agreement”. “That agreement has withstood 24 years and it has received great scrutiny.” He added he had heard no argument so far that suggested “there would be a quid pro quo of the protocol for changes in the Good Friday agreement”.",News/UK news,US ‘will not entertain’ UK trade deal that risks Good Friday agreement ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/24/us-will-not-entertain-uk-trade-deal-that-risks-good-friday-agreement
3/24/2022,"Traditional owners in the Northern Territory have launched an international legal bid to block the $4.7bn Barossa offshore gas project in the Timor Sea, saying the development will threaten marine life. Tiwi Islander and Larrakia traditional owners are seeking to prevent South Korea’s export credit agencies from financing the development, which would provide a new source of gas to the existing Darwin LNG facility. The project is a joint venture between Santos and SK E&S and will involve construction of a 300km pipeline to connect the gas field in the Timor Sea to the LNG facility. Traditional owners say they have not given their free, prior and informed consent for the pipeline, which would be laid through Tiwi sea country and into Darwin, Larrakia country. Tiwi Islanders say the project will damage their sea country and threaten marine life, particularly turtles, which play a central role in Tiwi culture. The legal action is seeking an order that would prevent the South Korean government from lending about AU$964m to the development via its export credit agencies, the Export-Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM) and the Korea Trade Insurance Corporation (K-SURE). Papers were filed in the Seoul central district court this week. In a statement released by the Stop Barossa Gas campaign, Francisco Babui, a senior Tiwi traditional owner, said the pipeline was too close to Cape Fourcroy, where there was a reef that provided habitat for turtles and dugongs. “The turtles lay their eggs on that beach and we go hunting in that area,” he said. “We use that coastline for camping and fishing. “In the dry season we take our children there every week. We teach them about our culture and dreaming stories.” Kevin Lance Quall, a senior Larrakia traditional owner, said the project “is devastating for us and our future”. “It will have a big impact, especially for Aboriginal people,” he said. “This kind of thing has been happening to Dangalaba and Larrakia people for over 40 years.” The Stop Barossa Gas campaign is a coalition of four organisations: the Environment Centre NT, Jubilee Australia Research Centre, the South Korean-based Solutions for Our Climate and the Japan Centre for a Sustainable Environment and Society. The campaign has targeted the development for the millions of tonnes of annual carbon emissions it would produce. Last year, the iron ore magnate Andrew Forrest said the proposal was “atrocious” and “one of the most polluting projects in the world”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Climate groups have labelled the project a “carbon bomb”, with a report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) finding the gas field had more carbon dioxide than any gas currently made into LNG. “At a time when the International Energy Agency has said that no new gas projects can go online if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change, for public financial institutions to be funding this dirty fossil fuel project is reckless and irresponsible,” said Jason Fowler, the Environment Centre NT’s energy campaigner. Dina Rui, campaigns director at Jubilee Australia, said public financing of fossil fuels “props up risky projects that otherwise might not go ahead”. A spokesperson for Santos said “as is the case for all of our projects, we undertake consultation with all key stakeholders where they receive detailed information about the project”.",News/Australia news,NT traditional owners launch international legal action over Barossa gas project,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/24/nt-traditional-owners-launch-international-legal-action-over-barossa-gas-project
3/24/2022,"Amid the gloom, sightings of blue sky enhance the brilliance of yellow daffodils that proclaim the rush of spring in this sheltered valley. On roadsides and in steep regenerating woodland, wind-battered, flamboyant narcissi flower year after year, discarded in the past in favour of newer commercial varieties, and naturalised in abandoned, steep market gardens. On our patch, a succession of old-fashioned trumpeted daffodils precede paler, small-cupped varieties, many growing in rows planted before the second world war. The earliest would have been picked in February, bunched and boxed for market in full flower, unlike modern types, grown on a field scale and sent away in tight bud. Dainty ‘Henry Irving’ on long stems is the first, followed by ‘Van Sion’ opening to frilly trumpets coloured like free-range egg yolks. This, the oldest variety, first named in 1620, was planted in little orchards marked on the 1840 tithe map; fruit trees have died or been cleared away, but these distinctive double daffodils thrive on adjoining hedge banks. Similar to the indigenous lent lily, my favourite is ‘Princeps’ with primrose yellow, slender trumpet and fluttering petals – first mentioned in 1830 and maybe of Italian stock. Other sorts, named before 1900, include vivid ‘Golden Spur’, tall ‘King Alfred’, the paler orange-tinged ‘Sir Watkin’, known as the mountain daffodil, and ‘Emperor’ and sturdy ‘Victoria’, both with creamy white petals surrounding golden trumpets. The prolific, dazzling ‘Helio’ is a large-cupped daffodil of the early 20th century; large buttery flowers of ‘Carlton’ are at their best now, as is ‘Fortune’, whose corona glows coppery, like the plumage of the cock pheasant patrolling his territory. The previous occupier of this ground grazed her house cow on these steep slopes, but encroaching brambles protected the rows of bulbs. Almost 50 years on, the former grazed area is planted with local apple and cherry trees interspersed with the long-standing daffodils, strimmed just once a year. Woodland overgrows neglected plots of once intensively cultivated, hardy narcissi, now coexisting with ferns, primrose, bluebell, wild arum and dog’s mercury, and where the chiffchaff has just returned to its familiar habitat.
