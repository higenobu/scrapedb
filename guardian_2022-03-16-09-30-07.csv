3/16/2022,"Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has told reporters “with allies like this we will win this war” after the prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia made a perilous train journey to Kyiv to offer their support. The comments from Ukraine’s president followed an extraordinary meeting with the three EU leaders in a capital which is close to being encircled by Russian forces. They are the first western visitors to Kyiv since the war began two weeks ago. During a press conference in Kyiv alongside Zelenskiy, the leader of Poland’s ruling party said an international peacekeeping mission should be sent to operate in Ukraine. “I think that it is necessary to have a peace mission - Nato, possibly some wider international structure - but a mission that will be able to defend itself, which will operate on Ukrainian territory,” Jaroslaw Kaczynski said. A series of Russian strikes hit a residential neighbourhood in the capital on Tuesday morning, igniting a huge fire and prompting a frantic rescue effort in a 15-storey apartment building. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said five people were killed in the airstrikes. Russian forces have reportedly taken patients and medical staff of a hospital in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol hostage. According to the BBC, the city’s deputy mayor Sergei Orlov said there were 400 people in the hospital and the Russian army were “using our patients and doctors like hostages”. About 2,000 cars were able to leave Mariupol, according to local authorities. Officials said a further 2,000 cars were waiting to leave the city. Deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said a convoy with supplies was stuck at nearby Berdyansk. More than 100 buses carrying civilians have left the besieged city of Sumy in north-east Ukraine for a safe area, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said. The evacuation consists of two separate convoys headed towards Poltava, in central Ukraine, ICRC spokesperson Jason Straziuso told Reuters. Nearly 100 children have died in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Zelenskiy said in a virtual address to Canadian lawmakers. Zelenskiy pleaded for Canada and its allies to do more to stop the Russian invasion of his country, including establishing a no-fly zone as civilian casualties mount. There are “fundamental contradictions” in talks aimed at ending Russia’s military attack on Ukraine but compromise is possible, a member of the Ukrainian delegation and presidential aide, Mykhailo Podolyak, said. “We’ll continue tomorrow. A very difficult and viscous negotiation process.” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that “talks are now continuing on giving Ukraine neutral military status, in the context of security guarantees for all participants in this process”. The US president, Joe Biden, will attend an EU summit in Brussels next week, an EU official said, according to AFP. A woman who interrupted a live news programme on Russian state TV last night to protest against the war in Ukraine has been fined 30,000 roubles (£215) by a Russian court. Marina Ovsyannikova, a Russian television producer, was found guilty of flouting protest legislation, the Russian state news agency RIA reported. Russian prosecutors have asked a court to move jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny to a maximum security prison after requesting that he serve 13 years in prison on new fraud charges, AFP reported. Navalny, Vladimir Putin’s most vocal critic in Russia, was jailed last year for parole violations related to charges he says were trumped up. The UK is to impose sanctions on 370 more Russian individuals, including more than 50 oligarchs and their families with a combined net worth of £100bn. More than 1,000 individuals and entities have now been targeted with sanctions since the invasion of Ukraine, with fresh measures announced against key Kremlin spokespeople and political allies of Putin, including the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu. Boris Johnson will visit Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday to ask the Gulf states to produce more oil and help the UK reduce dependence on Russian oil. The move sparked protests, following news that Saudi Arabia had executed 81 people just days earlier. More than 100,000 people have offered homes to Ukrainian refugees in the first 24 hours of a government scheme that allows families and individuals to bring them to the UK. The website for registering interest in the scheme crashed for a short while because of the numbers offering help.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 21 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-21-of-the-invasion
3/16/2022,"Several high-profile Indigenous journalists have condemned the Australian newspaper’s coverage as unethical, victim-blaming and insensitive following the acquittal of Northern Territory police officer Zachary Rolfe in relation to the shooting death of 19-year-old Kumanjayi Walker. A jury acquitted Rolfe of murder and related charges on Friday over the 2019 shooting of Walker in Yuendumu. The court heard Walker was shot three times, with Rolfe arguing he acted to protect his and his partner’s safety. The ABC’s Indigenous affairs editor, Bridget Brennan, said the News Corp broadsheet published a number of “reprehensible pieces” at the weekend. “This paper has published details of Kumanjayi Walker’s final moments,” Brennan said on Twitter. “This is the utmost cruelty when we know his family were locked outside the police station, holding out hope, while he died of gunshot wounds.” The Weekend Australian published an on-camera interview with Rolfe, conducted in late 2019, in which he said the NT police leadership “sacrificed me to appease a crowd, which is not what a good leader would do’’. In it Rolfe says the footage from the body cameras shows he and his colleagues tried their best to stop the bleeding after Walker was shot and to keep him comfortable. The interview is interspersed with graphic scenes of Walker on the floor of the police station as police administer first aid. The newspaper published several negative stories about Walker, including a description of him as “a very scary man” and an unwanted baby, and a headline that read: “Kumanjayi Walker’s family told cops where to find him”. Studio 10 and 10 News First presenter Narelda Jacobs, a Whadjuk Noongar woman, also criticised the coverage. “They portrayed him as an unwanted baby; as a criminal in every single thing that he did; they painted a picture of someone who deserved to be killed to justify the police actions on that day,” Jacobs told Guardian Australia. “Whereas the thing that was on trial was the second and third shots that were fired [by Rolfe].” Brennan, who was in the NT to cover the trial, called on Australian journalists to join her in condemning the coverage. She was particularly critical of an hour-long documentary published by the Australian, which featured extensive footage from the body cameras of the police officers as Walker was shot in his home, as well as when he lay dying and crying out in pain on the floor in the police station. The family has not seen the footage. “This is traumatising, unethical and appalling reporting that should never have been published by The Australian,” Brennan wrote. “If you work there, if you are a former employee, if you’re a leader in this industry, say something – loudly.” The Indigenous affairs officer at Media Diversity Australia, Gomeroi woman Madeline Hayman-Reber, said the reporting was “a national disgrace”. “The coverage has breached and ignored cultural protocols that were clearly set out by Kumanjayi Walker’s family prior to the commencement of Zachary Rolfe’s murder trial,” Hayman-Reber told Guardian Australia. “Media Diversity Australia wonders if the coverage would have been the same if the victim was a white man. “This unethical journalism has only inflicted more trauma on an already grieving community. “Our hearts go out to Kumanjayi Walker’s family, the Warlpiri community and First Nations communities across the country, who have lost so much and continue to suffer because of appalling media coverage.” Jacobs, who is also a member of the Walkleys board which oversees journalism standards, said: “They have portrayed him as a criminal who deserved to die. “It’s like they’re trying to justify the actions of the police. “The community didn’t need to hear these things because Kumanjayi Walker was loved. He was an active member of his community and his family. He wasn’t this monster that they painted him. “There are two standards. There’s a standard for Bipoc [Black, Indigenous and people of colour] people in this community and there’s a standard for everyone else.” The Australian described the video as a “subscriber exclusive” on its website with the headline: “Watch the video: moment cop Zachary Rolfe shoots teen Kumanjayi Walker”. The federal political editor for the West Australian, Lanai Scarr, who used to work for News Corp, criticised the paper’s reporting of domestic abuse in relation to Walker as “grossly irresponsible”. The Australian’s editor-in-chief, Christopher Dore, declined to answer questions but referred Guardian Australia to Wednesday’s editorial in which he justified the reporting as the “unvarnished truth”. The editorial argues that Walker’s death should not be “wilfully misconstrued as a new chapter in the culture wars” and says a similar outcry greeted the Australian’s reporting of domestic violence in communities in 1994. “Romanticising life on remote communities does not make it less bad for those who are experiencing neglect or terror,” the editorial says. “The unvarnished truth is what is needed to protect the innocent and bring about change.” On Wednesday the Australian’s Indigenous affairs reporter, Paige Taylor, wrote an opinion piece acknowledging the “disgust and anguish” among Indigenous people about the jury’s decision, while referring to the paper’s reporting on Walker as “a violent and deeply troubled person who was often impossible to be around”. “I see [the response] in the context of a litany of miserable and tragic interactions between white authority and Indigenous people,” Taylor wrote.

3/16/2022,"After the nine greatest days she has ever enjoyed on any tennis court around the world, Harriet Dart’s surprise breakthrough run to the second week of the BNP Paribas Open came to an end in the fourth round on Tuesday with a heavy defeat against a searing Madison Keys, who won their clash 6-1, 6-4 to reach the quarter-finals in Indian Wells. With her run this week, Dart will leave California as a top 100 player for the first time in her career, rising to become the new British No 2. The 25-year-old’s new ranking, if she can maintain it in the coming months, means she will gain direct entry into the grand slam tournaments and many WTA events as she looks to make a permanent jump on to the WTA tour. In Keys, Dart simply came up against a much more capable opponent who is in the midst of a resurgence after reaching the semi-final of the Australian Open last year. The gulf in weaponry and weight of shot between Dart, a slight counterpuncher, and Keys was enormous. From the beginning, Keys served well and she was sharp from the ground, and her greater weight of shot pierced through the court and pushed Dart far behind the baseline. After striking only one winner in the first set and struggling with her serve, Dart did much better in the second set and took care of her service games until she led 4-3. But at 4-4, Dart missed all four first serves, Keys laid waste to three consecutive second serves in a row, taking the essential break and the match shortly after. Although her tournament has come to an end, it is one that Dart will not forget. She arrived in Indian Wells having beaten only one top 65 player, Liudmila Samsonova last month, yet after coming through qualifying she clinched three such wins in succession. In the second round, she recovered from a set down to defeat 12th seed Elina Svitolina, her first ever win over a top-20 player. While the jump in Dart’s level has been significant, her breakthrough comes after a steady and clear period of progression in recent months. After falling outside of the top 170 after Wimbledon in July, Dart rose back up over 50 places to a recent career high of 120. “My ranking might not show where my level is, but I’ve always believed my level has been there,” Dart said after her third-round win. “I put in the work day in, day out, and finally to be able to put a run like this together, it’s not by chance.” Throughout her time in California, Dart has shown how her qualities can be effective at this level. She is an excellent athlete with the ability to absorb and redirect pace extremely well, particularly with her backhand, along with ample grit. She has been increasingly bold, stepping inside the baseline, taking the ball early and redirecting it. But Dart’s game is evidently still underpowered against the bigger hitters in the top 100, her serve is particularly a clear liability, and there is no bigger ball-striker in the game than Keys. Next up she will next face a red-hot Iga Swiatek, the third seed, who defeated Angelique Kerber 4-6, 6-2, 6-3. Dart’s defeat leaves Cameron Norrie as the last remaining British player in the singles draw as he looks to defend the title he won last October. He will face American Jenson Brooksby in the fourth round on Wednesday.",Sport/Sport,Harriet Dart’s unlikely Indian Wells run ended by resurgent Madison Keys,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/16/harriet-darts-unlikely-indian-wells-run-ended-by-resurgent-madison-keys
3/16/2022,"Few teachers are aware that equalities legislation applies to their school’s policies on hair, despite high-profile court cases affecting black students who have been penalised or excluded for their hairstyles, a survey has found. More than three-quarters of teachers had not received any training on how the 2010 Equality Act applies to school uniform and appearance policies, according to a poll of 500 teachers in a report for the World Afro Day campaign and Shift Insight consultancy. Just 12% said they had received equality and diversity training that included policies on hair. But 42% of those surveyed said their school’s uniform and appearance policies had “no potential to discriminate” and a further 30% said they thought there was only a low potential. In contrast, just 8% said the policies had a high or very high potential to discriminate. Michelle De Leon, the founder of World Afro Day, said traditional policies on hair were “clearly outdated” and failed to take into account the diversity of students. “Schools need uniform policies but this is the 21st century – they need to recognise that there are different hair types, and that to treat them all the same is discriminatory,” De Leon said. “Hair is part of a person’s identity. If schools understood that skin and hair are part of the same package they wouldn’t treat hair as something different. These are children’s bodies we are talking about.” Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “Our experience is that teachers and leaders are hugely focused on promoting diversity, equality and inclusion, and will welcome the insights provided by this excellent report. “The more we can do to raise awareness about the potential for afro hair discrimination the better, and ASCL is committed to working with World Afro Day to this end.” The report presented teachers with a real-life example of an 11-year-old boy who was refused entry to a Catholic secondary school in London because his hair was in cornrows braids. The boy took the school to the high court and won on the basis of “indirect racial discrimination”. When presented with the scenario, 71% said it was a case of discrimination, while the remainder said it was not or weren’t sure. Jane Powell, the managing director of Shift Insight, said the findings highlighted a “gap in understanding” among teachers and educators. In 2020 a schoolgirl won £8,500 in an out-of-court settlement against a secondary school in east London after she was repeatedly sent home because of her hair. The school’s written uniform policy stated that “afro-style hair must be of reasonable size and length”. After the legal action the policy was removed. Since 2020 schools in the UK have been able to sign up to the Halo Code, which pledges to end discrimination against black hairstyles.",News/Education,Survey shows teachers unaware equality laws apply to pupils’ hair,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/16/survey-shows-teachers-unaware-equality-laws-apply-to-pupils-hair
3/16/2022,"From the death of the suit during the pandemic to Harry Styles appearing on the cover of US Vogue in a dress, the conversations around masculinity and fashion appear to be contemporary, however a new exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum aims to link modern men’s fashion to its storied past. Fashioning Masculinities: The Art of Menswear, which opens on 19 March, will feature a host of contemporary fashion designers (Versace, Calvin Klein, Martine Rose) alongside historical examples of the way men dressed (from Bowie to Beau Brummell). There are more than 100 pieces which the curators hope will illustrate how glacial the trends around men’s fashion actually are. “This show is not chronological,” explained Claire Wilcox, one of the exhibition’s co-curators. “We’ve juxtaposed the past with the present and tried to show the parallels in the way men have dressed.” The exhibition has been done in partnership with the fashion label Gucci. Since he began as the brand’s creative director in 2015, Alessandro Michele has been vocal about fashion becoming more gender neutral, detaching menswear from toxic masculinity. He writes in the introduction to the book that accompanies Fashioning Masculinities: “In a patriarchal society, masculine gender identity is often moulded by violently toxic stereotypes … Any possible reference to femininity is aggressively banned.” In the shadow of #MeToo and toxic masculinity, contemporary conversations around masculinity and fashion have shown no sign of slowing down. The exhibition attempts to show that men were always expressing their gender identities through their clothes. “There’s a contemporary question of visibility, but if you go back there’s a history of [this in the] 19th, 18th and even 17th century, people were not gender conformists and instead they were expressing themselves through their clothes,” said Rosalind McKever, Wilcox’s co-curator. Wilcox added that by looking back, Fashioning Masculinities showed that “male fashion has operated in a way that is liberating. A liberation which is still possible today.” As an expression of the multiple conversations taking place around men’s fashion, the exhibition is split into sections. Undressed explores male body image, in part through discussions around underwear, and asks – in the context of conversations about “dad bods”, “himbos” and plus-size male models – what does an ideal male body look like in 2022? “By placing historical garments next to contemporary ones, we see that the type of body which might be considered fashionable changes continually,” said Wilcox. “And there’s a number of ‘ideals’ at any given time.” Featuring many famous two-pieces including Beatles mod-ish “mop top” suits, the second section, Redressed, looks at the past and future of the suit, while the section titled Overdressed looks at peacocking in men’s fashion. The final section features three gowns that went viral thanks to their wearers: Billy Porter’s tuxedo gown by Christian Siriano, which he wore at the Oscars in 2019, the Alessandro Michele for Gucci custom gown and tailored jacket worn by Harry Styles as the first solo male cover star of US Vogue in 2020, and the wedding dress worn by Bimini Bon-Boulash in the UK final of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK. While recent men’s trends such as crop tops or the revival of codpieces have been met with derision, Fashioning Masculinities will show that this too, is far from a new phenomenon. “Fashion is always criticised – anything new is regarded with suspicion,” said Wilcox. “Then it becomes part of the lexicon of fashion. Today, menswear has got such a wealth of fascinating history to draw on and nothing is out of bounds, whether that’s a skirted garment or a crop top, but I don’t see anything happening today that hasn’t already happened in history.” Despite the scope of the Fashion Masculinities, the curators say they have only skimmed the surface of men’s fashion. “It’s been impossible to reflect the whole of menswear in one show,” said Wilcox. “We hope this is the first of many.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,‘Death of the suit’: V&A exhibition explores evolution of menswear,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/16/death-of-the-suit-va-exhibition-explores-evolution-of-menswear
3/16/2022,"Patients waiting for surgery and cancer care in England will face long delays for years to come, MPs have warned in a new report that is highly critical of both ministers and NHS bosses. The already-record 6.1 million-strong waiting list for vital treatment will keep growing and officials are “too optimistic” that plans to tackle it will succeed, the public accounts committee (PAC) said in a report on Wednesday. “For the next few years it is likely that waiting time performance for cancer and elective care will remain poor and the waiting list for elective care will continue to grow,” it said. The committee of MPs, which monitors spending across Whitehall, acknowledges Covid-19’s role in contributing to the ballooning backlog and lengthening waiting times. But it singled out years of inaction by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) for particular blame. “DHSC has overseen a long-term decline in elective and critical cancer care that is dragging our National Health Service and the heroic staff down,” said Dame Meg Hillier, the chair of the cross-party committee. Even before the pandemic struck in spring 2020 the DHSC did not increase the NHS’s capacity to deal with growing demand and give patients the speedy care that is their legal right. The NHS has not managed to hit the target of treating 92% of those awaiting non-urgent care within 18 weeks since February 2016 and has not met the eight key targets for cancer care since 2014, the PAC points out. The MPs also doubt that the extra £8bn Boris Johnson has given NHS England (NHSE) for 2022-2025, the recent “elective recovery plan” or the pledge that hospitals will increase by 30% the number of operations they perform by 2025 – the three key steps being taken to tackle the backlog – will have any meaningful impact on it. “We on [the] PAC are now extremely concerned that there is no real plan to turn a large cash injection, for elective care and capital costs of dangerously crumbling facilities, into better outcomes for people waiting for life-saving or quality of life improving treatment”, added Hillier. Despite the £8bn boost, the DHSC and NHS England “have not set out in meaningful detail what the money will be spent on”, the report said. The NHS will be less able to execute its ambitious plans to improve waiting times unless “longstanding workforce issues” are fixed, it adds. The MPs also warn that: Large numbers of people waiting a long time for care “presents a huge risk” to GPs, A&E units and ambulance services Persistently long delays for care could increase public dissatisfaction with the NHS NHSE’s plan to create 566 more hospital beds is inadequate, given the scale of demand In an apparent aside at Sajid Javid, the health secretary, who is pushing ahead with a reorganisation of the NHS and claimed that poor leadership in it has contributed to long delays, Hillier added that “the cycle of glib headlines and fiddling with management structures must be broken” and replaced with a proper plan to end the service’s staffing crisis. Johnson has cited the backlog as a key reason for raising national insurance by 1.25 percentage points from 1 April to yield an extra £12bn a year to put into the NHS and social care. A DHSC spokesperson said: “The pandemic has put unprecedented pressures on healthcare and we are tackling this head on. “We have set out our action plan to deal with the Covid backlog and deliver long-term recovery and reform, backed by a record multibillion-pound investment over the next three years, and our Ten-Year Plan on cancer.” New surgical hubs and community diagnostic hubs will help reduce waiting times by providing an extra 9m scans, checks and procedures a year by 2025 for conditions such as cancer, they added.",News/Society,Surgery and cancer care in England will have long delays for years – report,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/16/surgery-and-cancer-care-in-england-will-have-long-delays-for-years-report
3/16/2022,"Ralf Rangnick said the referee’s failure to award a free-kick in the buildup to Atlético Madrid’s winner was decisive as Manchester United were knocked out of the Champions League last 16. Renan Lodi’s 41st-minute strike means it will be at least five seasons since United last won a trophy. The goal occurred after a coming together of Anthony Elanga and Reinildo Mandava, with the referee, Slavko Vinic, judging there was no foul. Rangnick said: “There were some curious refereeing decisions, I wouldn’t necessarily say decisive – maybe the one they scored. I believe it was a foul on Anthony Elanga, the referee and linesman didn’t see it that way. He [Vinic] made it pretty easy for Atlético to do their time-wasting antics and it didn’t make it any easier for us. In the second half, I don’t know if the game was played for more than two minutes without being interrupted with someone lying on the floor.” Rangnick was asked if his players had failed to turn up for their biggest game of the season. “We didn’t score, that’s true. We played a good first half, all those things that we planned to do in the first half the team did. The only thing we didn’t achieve is to convert that energetic performance into the first goal and against a team like Atlético it’s highly important you score the first goal. “And it’s more important not to concede a goal and we conceded just before half-time in a transitional moment. “We shouldn’t have been 1-0 down at half-time, we were the better team in the first half. It’s important to score first – even more so against a team like Atlético.” David de Gea was asked about United’s trophy drought. “You’re right – too many years without any trophies – that we are fighting for trophies,” the goalkeeper said. “So I think we need to be clear: that we want to achieve good things, fight for trophies, we don’t just want to play for the top four, and be there, get out of the Champions League [early]. We need much more from everyone because this club is too big for where we are now. We are far from fighting places for the Premier League and Champions League.” At the final whistle Diego Simeone had objects thrown at him by fans as Atlético’s manager ran towards the tunnel, though he was unaware of this. “I don’t know what happened,” he said. United will now focus on Champions League qualification via a top-four finish.

3/16/2022,"The Queensland government will pay a $3,000 subsidy to electric vehicle buyers and build new charging stations to incentivise take-up, under a new strategy to be announced on Wednesday. The 10-year strategy includes measures the state says will help to drive down emissions and ultimately help Queensland meet its net zero commitment by 2050. Alongside the strategy, the government will announce it is committing $55m to new initiatives: $45m for incentives for upfront purchases of EVs cheaper than $58,000 from July 1, and $10m to build new charging stations. There are about 8,000 electric vehicles currently registered in Queensland and the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the new strategy – announced as petrol prices hit record highs – aims to assist buyers with making the change. “We know more and more Queenslanders are transitioning to electric vehicles as more come on the market,” Palaszczuk said. “It will also support jobs and create a better environment.” The transport minister, Mark Bailey, said the strategy “signals a fundamental shift in our transport system” “Not only does this encourage people to buy electric vehicles, it gives the automotive industry confidence to set up shop in Queensland,” Bailey said. “Queensland is one of the sunniest and windiest places on Earth and can become a renewable energy superpower, creating a sustainable jobs boom.” The new strategy includes other measures the state says are already under way, including the augmentation of the electricity grid to cope with a projected long-term increase in charging demand. The government had already announced that new buses in south-east Queensland would be zero emissions, and soon all new state government fleet vehicles will be electric, provided there is a fit-for-purpose option. “Transforming the QFleet will save Queenslanders millions in fuel costs but most significantly, when they have done their service with frontline workers – our nurses, community carers and educators – these high-quality, fully serviced, usually low-kilometre used vehicles will be available for Queenslanders at highly affordable prices,” De Brenni said. “That will deliver a clear signal and pipeline to car manufacturers, battery and minerals manufacturers and charging infrastructure manufacturers that Queensland is the place to grow their business and continue to build on our state’s successful jobs and economic results.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Solar Citizens, an advocacy group for rooftop solar owners and clean transport, said the funding package gets Queensland “out of the slow lane”. “With fuel prices and the cost of living going through the roof, more and more people want to switch to cars you can fuel-up at home for a fraction of the cost,” said Stephanie Gray from Solar Citizens. “Government support for the rollout of electric vehicles is vital for Australian families to have a long-term solution to battle volatile petrol prices.” Gray said the price tag of electric vehicles remained a major barrier for most people, with relatively few options on the market for less than $58,000.. “The $3,000 rebate … puts Queensland on the same page as states like New South Wales and South Australia that are encouraging the uptake of cleaner cars,” Gray said. “But more government support is needed to build a thriving local electric vehicle industry and provide commuters with a reprieve from high fuel prices. “We’ve seen a number of states make commitments to boost the uptake of electric transport while the Morrison Government has been asleep at the wheel on this issue.”",News/Australia news,"Queensland to provide $3,000 subsidy to buy electric vehicles",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/16/queensland-to-provide-3000-subsidy-to-buy-electric-vehicles
3/16/2022," Deep into the 94th minute at Old Trafford, Manchester United swarmed forward for one last attack. As the famous red shirts massed ominously in the penalty area, the Stretford End rose as one, shouted as one, dreamed in vivid noise and colour of a classic United comeback. Meanwhile, surging forward with the ball at his feet, the messenger at the gates of glory, was Nemanja Matic. Well, Matic carried on running. Slowed. Slowed a little more. Took a look up. Panicked. Remembered that he still had a football at his feet. Spotted Marcus Rashford on the right wing: the simplest and least threatening ball, but the only one that would not require him to stop, turn, swivel or twist. The moment passed, and a good deal more quickly than Matic. In a weird way, it would have been fitting if Matic had belted the equaliser in from 30 yards. Such had been the nihilistic incoherence of United’s second-half strategy that it was about as likely a scenario as anything else. They had 11 shots in the whole game, of which Diogo Dalot had four and Raphaël Varane two. Six shots for the United defence. None for Cristiano Ronaldo. You probably needed to be a tactical genius on the Ralf Rangnick plane to work out the thinking behind that. But you can’t really pin this one on Rangnick. This is simply United’s level now. They didn’t play within themselves, they didn’t disgrace themselves. They simply played like what they are: a wildly uneven team with great individual quality but without the composure to control games, the defensive quality to close them out, or the tactical quality to find their own solutions on the pitch. Up front they remain curiously dependent on a striker who has scored in two of his past 12 fixtures – the same as the Leeds forward Joe Gelhardt – and who for all his occasional heroics is enduring his most inconsistent season in 20 years of professional football. Even so there was a particularly chaotic feel to United in the final half-hour, a period that generated five substitutions and no end of confusion. Last to arrive was Juan Mata, a player widely assumed to have retired in 2018, slotting in at the base of midfield, with a five-man attack ahead of him. From the stands, we stared blankly at Rangnick. Was this the plan? Had they trained in this formation? Or was Rangnick, like everyone else in a red shirt, simply making it up as he went along? The great shame was that United had started with such promise. It was an atmosphere as good as any Old Trafford has provided all season. There was slick forward movement and a chance for Anthony Elanga. Fred, recently possessed by the spirit of Duncan Edwards, was everywhere: tackling, creating, arguing, doing mad skills: a player finally scaling the limits of his potential. These are the times when United still make some sense: youth and experience, academy products and marquee signings, good football in front of a passionate crowd. United have always been capable of such moments. The problem is that they can rarely sustain them for a game, let alone a season. Push at the walls, squeeze their weak points, and they have no idea how to react. Atlético stole the lead late in the first half and from that point United simply crumbled. All of a sudden, Bruno Fernandes was going where he wanted. Ronaldo was going where he wanted. Elanga didn’t have a clue. Harry Maguire was doing swivel-turns in his own penalty area like a supermarket trolley with a wonky wheel. Scott McTominay dropped deeper and Fred pushed higher, leaving a huge hole in midfield. Ten minutes of mild adversity was all it took for the concept of United the team to evaporate. On the touchline, Rangnick made a triple substitution just to try to feel something again. A word for Atlético who were shamelessly magnificent, channelling some ouija-board vision of their former selves, scrapping and shithousing like the team they once were, rather than the 12th best defence in La Liga. United will howl and moan at the gamesmanship, the grizzled tactics, the Slovenian referee. But really United were lucky to be here. In eight European games they have needed late goals in five. They were originally picked to face Paris Saint-Germain in this round, only for the draw to be voided. Here, perhaps, their luck finally ran out. And here again we come to the crux. Strip away the hubris and the history, the money spent and the words expended, and is this United side really any better than – say – Ajax or Napoli or Marseille? Perhaps we need to stop thinking of United as profligate underachievers. This is where they are: a second-rank side, an also-ran, a makeweight. Well tried, lads. Better luck next year.",Sport/Football,Erratic display shines light on Manchester United’s also-ran status | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/15/erratic-display-shines-light-on-manchester-uniteds-also-ran-status
3/16/2022,"Long-term exposure to air pollution can increase the risk of autoimmune disease, research has found. Exposure to particulates has already been linked to strokes, brain cancer, miscarriage and mental health problems. A global review, published in 2019, concluded that almost every cell in the body could be affected by dirty air. Now researchers at the University of Verona have found that long-term exposure to high levels of air pollution was associated with an approximately 40% higher risk of rheumatoid arthritis, a 20% higher risk of inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis, and a 15% higher risk of connective tissue diseases, such as lupus. The study, published in the journal RMD Open, took comprehensive medical information about 81,363 men and women on an Italian database monitoring risk of fractures between June 2016 and November 2020. About 12% were diagnosed with an autoimmune disease during this period. Each patient was linked to the nearest air quality monitoring station via their residential postcode. The study analysed average long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (known as PM10 and PM2.5), which is produced by sources such as vehicles and power stations. Concentration levels of 30µg/m3 for PM10 and 20µg/m3 for PM2.5 are the thresholds generally considered harmful to human health. The study concluded that overall, long-term exposure to particulates above these levels was associated with, respectively, a 12% and 13% higher risk of developing an autoimmune disease. Felicity Gavins, the director of the Centre for Inflammation Research and Translational Medicine at Brunel University London, said: “This study further supports the mounting evidence suggesting a link between air pollution exposure and immune-mediated diseases.” But she cautioned against inferring that dirty air caused these conditions. “Whether air pollution exposure specifically causes autoimmune diseases remains controversial, although there is no doubt that there is a link.” She also said more research was needed to ascertain why some areas of Italy had seen heightened growth in autoimmune conditions, and to look at the impact of passive smoking on the findings. The researchers acknowledge their findings do not prove a causal link and that other factors may be at play, including lack of information on when autoimmune disease symptoms began, or that air quality monitoring might not reflect personal exposure to pollutants, and that the findings might not be more widely applicable because study participants largely comprised older women at risk of fractures. But air pollution has already been linked to immune system abnormalities, and smoking, which shares some toxins with fossil fuel emissions, was a predisposing factor for rheumatoid arthritis, said Dr Giovanni Adami, one of the report’s authors and a rheumatologist at the University of Verona. “The World Health Organization has recently identified air pollution as one of the greatest environmental risks to health,” he said. “Our study provides new real-life evidence on the link between autoimmune diseases and air pollution exposure. In addition, there is a strong biological rationale underpinning our findings. However, a causal relationship is hard to prove. Indeed, it is unlikely that randomised controlled studies could be conducted on such topic.”",News/Environment,Air pollution linked to higher risk of autoimmune diseases,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/15/air-pollution-exposure-linked-higher-risk-autoimmune-diseases
