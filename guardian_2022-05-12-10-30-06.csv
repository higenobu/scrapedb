5/12/2022,"The more things change for many Australians the more they stay shamefully the same for Indigenous people in Western Australia’s ill-named “justice system” – particularly if they happen to be jailed at Roebourne in the Pilbara. While searching through the archives of the State Library of Western Australia, historian Chris Owen came across a telling photograph of Aboriginal inmates of the original Roebourne regional prison, which closed in 1923 (and briefly reopened from 1975 to 1984). If a picture could tell the story of a prison system that was – and remains – medieval for Indigenous prisoners, this one, taken between about 1890 and 1900, might be it. The male prisoners are seen in the picture chained together by their necks. Judging from the tribal ligatures on the upper bodies of several, they were living traditionally before their arrest. Those chained at the neck include two boys – one perhaps 14, the other maybe 11, 10 or younger. They are also chained to their wheelbarrows. The wheelbarrow (together with the pick and shovel) was the symbol of the white invader’s progress. But the barrow was also a human yoke for the WA Black man who dug the roads, built the rich pastoralists’ fences and helped quarry the minerals that built the white man’s wealth from the bounty of stolen Aboriginal land. Anyone from the prime minister down who laughably asserts that slavery didn’t exist in Australia should look carefully at this photograph and many others besides. The great myth of Australian pioneering is that Australia was built on the backs of white miners and pastoralist’s sheep. The truth, at least in the west, is it was built on the enslaved and broken backs of Aboriginal people. Just three of the chained Aboriginal males have been afforded hats to resist the stifling sun in notoriously baking Roebourne where, this summer, the temperature climbed above 50C (hold that thought). Every non-Indigenous person in the photo wears a hat. Prof Barry Godfrey, who is making a documentary about the original Roebourne prison and what ought become of it, says Aboriginal prisoners were marched there on the chain and on foot across vast distances. “People would be marched for hundreds of miles, thousands of kilometres, in hot, really hot, terrible conditions, often chained with the guards on horseback,” Godfrey, a social justice academic at the University of Liverpool, recently told ABC Pilbara. “People routinely marched from the Kimberley, from all over the Pilbara, all over different parts of Western Australia.” There was little relief from the searing heat upon arrival at the Roebourne jail; the prisoners were kept tethered to the walls in chains at night while the temperatures inside often reached 50C in summer. “I don’t want to gloss it. It was horrendous,” Godfrey said. He was talking about jail conditions a century or more ago. And yet ( … the more things stay the same) he may well have been talking about the newer Roebourne prison, which opened in 1984. Ninety percent of the inmates at that prison are Indigenous. All routinely complain about the appalling physical and mental health impacts of the extreme heat inside – not least earlier this year when Roebourne reached a record 50.5C. The Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia has lobbied successive state governments to install air-conditioning in all cells. It argues correctly that the appalling situation within the prison – where inmates can’t sleep or function during the day because of the extreme heat – presents a “flagrant breach of human rights” and is “inherently discriminatory” given the high proportion of Indigenous inmates. ABC Pilbara, which has commendably prosecuted the open-shut case for fully air-conditioning the prison, published parts of a letter from the WA corrective services minister Bill Johnston to the legal service. In it Johnston reportedly writes that prison authorities manage “thermal discomfort” (if there is a more artful euphemism for extreme heat stress and dangerous dehydration, let’s see it!) by a variety of means including sunscreen and wide-brimmed hats – and by making electrolyte drinks available to buy at the prison canteen. Generous, that. There are also ice machines throughout the prison, and desktop fans in cells – which, you’d have to think, would do little to combat night-time temperatures of 38-plus degrees. “At the time that RRP [Roebourne regional prison] was constructed in 1984, the Department of Justice assessed the use of air conditioning at the facility against the regulatory and community standards at the time,” the minister’s letter reportedly said. “In 1984 air conditioning was not the standard in the local community or a feature of most homes and it was not included in the building plans. Relative to other forms of temperature control, air conditioning is likely to require extensive retrofitting for efficient operation.” So … it’s apparently too expensive, then. At this point it pays to step back and think a little about the Pilbara and whose land it really is, and the amount of wealth its natural resources generate for WA and the federal government. According to the WA Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development: “The Pilbara is the state’s mining powerhouse and makes a significant contribution to the national wealth. Its iron ore and liquefied natural gas industries are valued at over $70bn, representing more than 70% of mineral and energy production in Western Australia.” That’s $70bn! And yet successive governments have refused to spend a fraction of it on air-conditioning the jail where it send its Indigenous prisoners to swelter and suffer. Owen, an honorary research fellow at the University of WA, has done more than any other (not least through his remarkable book Every Mother’s Son is Guilty) to highlight how WA profited from the enforced labour of Indigenous people in the pastoral and mining industries, and the obscene and inhumane cruelty against them. The historian points to the historical symmetry of that photo of Black men in chains outside the old jail and the conditions in today’s version. “Yes, for too many Aboriginal people here it is a matter of the more things stay the same. There is the same punitive attitude in the justice system and the same abuses of human rights,” Owen says. It all begs a simple question: what’s the difference between being an Indigenous inmate of Roebourne prison in 1900 and today? The answer: only 122 years.",News/Australia news,This picture tells the story of a prison that was – and remains – medieval for Aboriginal inmates,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2022/may/12/this-picture-tells-the-story-of-a-prison-that-was-and-remains-medieval-for-aboriginal-inmates
5/12/2022,"St Kilda AFL men’s player Tom Campbell has always been concerned about environmental issues. But it was the black summer bushfires of 2019/20 that spurred him to galvanise players into using their position and platforms to do something about climate change. “The images we were seeing on TV of communities right around Australia being impacted by those extreme fires … and then, the very small impact that had on us as AFL players, forcing our training to be conducted indoors, that started the conversations amongst players,” he says. When all 10 Victorian AFL clubs relocated to Queensland hubs for the 2020 men’s season, Campbell said players started talking openly about the impact of climate change on extreme weather and natural disasters. “That experience of being connected and so close to so many players led to us forming this group of AFL Players 4 Climate Action (AFLP4CA),” he says. That group now has more than 260 AFLM and W players, and is running its first in-person event with volunteers from the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) at Fitzroy Bowls Club on Thursday night. Called Let’s Kick Climate Goals, the night will feature a panel discussion involving prominent AFL players such as Campbell, Collingwood’s Jordan Roughead and AFLW Western Bulldogs player Nell Morris-Dalton, as well as discuss climate action opportunities at local, grass roots clubs, something Campbell, 30, is particularly looking forward to. “Football is played in communities right around Australia, from the city to country towns and rural places … football is often the lifeblood of communities,” he says. “And I think we have a really great opportunity to use football to have a really genuine conversation to highlight the impact that climate change is having on communities around the country and also be part of the solutions. The St Kilda player said the group wants to normalise climate action and remove it from being “something that is really politicised”. “We definitely would love to chat to people from community clubs because as players at the elite level, we’d love to learn from people at grassroots about the issues that they face, so we can better support them,” he says. The AFL has no official involvement in the initiative but a spokesperson for the organisation has said the AFL “fully supports player-led initiatives in raising further awareness and encouraging action on climate change”. According to Campbell, a survey run by AFLP4CA of over 600 players found that 92 % were concerned about climate change and the impact that climate chance will have on the future of their game. “So, we know that AFL players are deeply concerned about this issue,” he says. Paul Sinclair, campaign director at ACF, said sport has a tremendous opportunity to bring people together. “Take AFL; there’s almost two million Australians who are involved in playing footy and we reckon they need to be part of a conversation about finding solutions to climate change because it impacts a game that they love,” he says.

5/12/2022,"The Russian-controlled administration in the Ukrainian city of Kherson has said it plans to request annexation by Moscow, a move that would confirm the Kremlin’s permanent occupation of Ukrainian territory captured since February. Kyiv said Moscow plans to hold a fake referendum on independence or annexation. The Kremlin responded that it was up to residents living in region to decide whether they wanted to join Russia, but any decision must have a legal basis. Russian and Ukrainian forces appear to be settling into a gruelling and deadly stalemate in Ukraine’s east. Despite claims from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Ukrainian counteroffensives around Kharkiv and elsewhere were pushing invading Russian forces back, Ukrainian successes appeared to be confined for now to the far north-eastern and south-western flanks of the 300-mile frontline. Ukraine claimed it has recaptured Pytomnyk, a village north of Kharkiv, about halfway to the Russian border. “The occupying forces moved to the defence in order to slow down the pace of the offensive of our troops,” Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said in its latest report. “The settlement of Pytomnyk … was liberated.” Boris Johnson has promised to support Sweden and Finland against potential Russian threats in any way necessary. The UK prime minister travelled to both countries to sign mutual security agreements, with their governments mulling Nato membership in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, said joining would be to “maximise security” and not be in any way offensive. Ukraine has said it will suspend the flow of gas through a transit point that it says delivers almost a third of the fuel piped from Russia to Europe through Ukraine. GTSOU, which operates Ukraine’s gas system, said it would stop shipments via the Sokhranivka route from Wednesday, declaring “force majeure”, a clause invoked when a business is hit by something beyond its control. Gas flows from Russia’s Gazprom to Europe via Ukraine fell by a quarter on Wednesday. Zelenskiy warned Kyiv was running out of patience to hold talks with Russia, given the mounting evidence of atrocities committed by Russian forces in his country. He said the possibility to negotiate “disappears” with “each new Bucha, each new Mariupol”. The war will end when Ukraine reclaims everything that Russia took from it, Zelenskiy maintained. “The war will end for the Ukrainian people only when we get back what’s ours,” he said in an online address with students of leading universities in France, representatives of academia and the media. Three Russian prisoners of war accused of targeting or murdering civilians, and a soldier who allegedly killed a man before raping his wife, are set to be in the dock in the first war crimes trials of the Ukraine conflict, the Ukrainian prosecutor general has revealed. More than 10,700 crimes have been registered since the war began by the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general, led by Iryna Venediktova, and a handful of cases have now been filed or are ready to be submitted. Ukraine has proposed to Russia that badly injured defenders in the Azovstal steel plant in the southern port of Mariupol be swapped for Russian prisoners of war, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Wednesday. “There is no agreement yet. Negotiations are continuing,” she said in a post on Telegram. Russia has demanded a formal apology from Poland and threatened possible future reprisals after its ambassador was doused with red paint at the Soviet military cemetery in Warsaw on Monday. The statement by Russia’s foreign ministry came after it summoned the Polish ambassador, Krzysztof Krajewski, to receive its protest. A Chinese former ambassador to Ukraine, Gao Yusheng, has strongly criticised Russia’s invasion. In a speech which was reported on by the Chinese press before quickly being taken down, Gao said Putin’s frequent “violations” of former Soviet states’ territory were “the greatest threat to peace, security and stability in Eurasia”. The wives of two of the last remaining Ukrainian fighters holed up in Mariupol’s steelworks asked Pope Francis to help get soldiers to a third country. One told him: “You are our last hope, I hope you can save their lives. Please don’t let them die.”",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 78 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-78-of-the-invasion
5/12/2022,"At the Team Zali shop there are sets of dangly teal earrings for $12 a pop. A dog bandanna will set you back $12; a tote bag $8. You can buy a Team Zali swimming cap, a bucket hat or an umbrella. Corflutes for the independent Warringah MP are, unsurprisingly, free. Team Zali will even deliver. “Catch the new wave,” Zali Steggall’s website says. Almost everyone expects Steggall to hold on to the seat she picked up from former prime minister Tony Abbott at the last election. The dog bandannas might help. So might the fact her controversial Liberal opponent, Katherine Deves, has doubled down on her offensive comments about trans people. Then there’s Team Zali’s advertising. The latest figures from advertising on Facebook and Instagram show the team spent more than $10,000 on Facebook ads in the 30 days to 7 May. In the digital space, $10,000 is a lot. University of Queensland political scientist, Dr Glenn Kefford, says the amount being spent by independents overall is “quite incredible”. “We’re breaking new ground here,” he says. Further up the graph of the independents’ spending, Allegra Spender, who’s trying to unseat Liberal MP Dave Sharma in Wentworth, has spent just over $28,000. Monique Ryan, the independent challenging treasurer Josh Frydenberg in Kooyong, dropped $47,000 over the same period. UQ’s tracking site is monitoring the spend for almost 4,000 pages, and Kefford has outlined the spend from the so-called teal independents for the Conversation. Alfie's not really sure about his new bandana but I'm certain he will grow to love it.https://t.co/5r1uKJ5lBqDog bandanas are available in our store now.#auspol #mon4kooyong #dogs4mon pic.twitter.com/91oroq5HNk He says the “big takeaway” from the data is the amount of money they’re spending in the digital space. “The real leader here in terms of spend online is Monique Ryan,” he says. “She’s spent [almost] $50,000 in just the last 30 days. Her messaging is in front of tens of thousands of voters – not just in her electorate but around Victoria, and in Sydney as well.” The UQ data shows the Liberal party has spent about the same amount as Ryan’s team in the seat, while Labor spending is absent. The article in the Conversation notes that previous independents such as Tony Windsor did not have the sort of resources available now to the teals. A Guardian Australia investigation of a broader range of advertising spending (including YouTube and Google as well as Facebook) found in some seats, Liberal MPs at risk from the teal independents were being outspent. Kefford says the teals have a very effective strategy. Most of them share similar messages, and of course the colour. That means Ryan’s messages, for example, will get reinforced by Steggall’s, and so on, with people likely to see advertisements for different candidates. “By spending this amount of money, [the independents] can layer their messages,” Kefford says. “They’re talking about the issue that the major parties are completely ignoring … climate change. The majors don’t want to touch that with a 10-foot pole. “It’s a message that’s resonating, so I think they’re hitting their brief. By focusing on climate change, they know their primary opponents, whether it’s Frydenberg or Sharma or whoever, there’s only so much they can say [because of the Coalition’s history on climate change policy].” Dr Andrew Hughes, a political marketing lecturer at the Australian National University, says the digital approach lets independents target people in “micro” or “nano” ways – down to the level of a local coffee shop, for example. “It’s reinforced, it’s smart, it’s effective, it’s lined up to the target market, it’s speaking their language,” he says. “The theory was independent campaigns would fail because they couldn’t compete with the mass marketing [of the major parties]. But with digital and social media, as it’s more targeted and effective, that [advantage] gets washed away.” Hughes says the teals’ individual campaigns are “integrated really well”. “It’s consistent with the brand, and who they are, because they’re not trying to be more than centre left. Teal – it’s green with a hint of blue,” he says. “From the colour, to the profile of the people they’re targeting for the merchandise – dog bandannas, earrings. I can’t see Labor doing dog bandannas … but it works well for Zali because it’s on brand.”",News/Australia news,Dog bandannas and digital ads: how effective is the teal independents’ campaign strategy?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/dog-bandannas-and-digital-ads-how-effective-is-the-teal-independents-campaign-strategy
5/12/2022,"Alan Tudge has had no contact with senior officials in his department since he stood aside as education minister aside more than five months ago, except for the cancellation of scheduled meetings and a welfare check via WhatsApp. Tudge still technically holds his ministerial position and is willing to resume those duties if the Coalition is re-elected, but Guardian Australia can reveal he has had very limited communication with the education department in the meantime. A freedom of information application for all communications between Tudge and the secretary or other senior officers of the department between 3 December and 11 April uncovered just three instances. Two were the head of the department cancelling previously scheduled commitments: a weekly meeting between the department and the minister’s office, and a pre-briefing about a gathering of the country’s education ministers. The third was a WhatsApp exchange between a senior public servant and Tudge. “Hi Minister,” a senior departmental officer wrote on 3 December. “Hope you are doing ok. Tough day – hope you have some support wrapped around you. Take care.” Tudge replied three days later. “Appreciate the message,” he said. “Yes, had better days.” Tudge stood aside from his ministerial position on 2 December, after claims from the former senior political adviser Rachelle Miller that he had been emotionally and, on one occasion, physically abusive to her while they were in a relationship in 2017. Tudge denies the allegations. On 4 March the government released a report by the former bureaucrat Vivienne Thom, finding there was insufficient evidence Tudge had breached the ministerial standards. Miller chose not to participate in the inquiry, saying the government had ignored her concerns over its terms of reference. On Tuesday Tudge would not say if he wanted to return to the role of education minister after the election, but indicated he was willing to do so. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The PM has made clear my arrangements. The PM has said if we win the election and I’m in a position to return to the frontbench then I will do so,” he said at a prepoll in his Melbourne electorate of Aston. Tudge would not say whether he had been involved in cabinet meetings or if he had had contact with the acting education minister, Stuart Robert, or education officials. “It’s a matter for me who I have spoken to and when I have spoken to them,” he said. Scott Morrison has faced repeated questions about the unorthodox ministerial arrangements. On the first day of the election campaign, the prime minister said: “Alan Tudge is still in my cabinet.” That seemed to contradict a statement on 4 March when Morrison said of Tudge: “Today he has informed me that in the interests of his family and his own wellbeing and in order to focus on his re-election as the member for Aston he is not seeking to return to the frontbench, and I support his decision.” Morrison later moved to clarify that Tudge was “technically” still a member of the cabinet, but that he had not been receiving a ministerial salary since December. Pressed on the meaning of “technically”, Morrison said: “It means that he still has his warrant as a minister from the governor general. And as a result, he’s formally still the education minister.” The prime minister said the Victorian MP “stood aside for his own health and family reasons, and when he is ready to return to the cabinet then he will”. Morrison was more definitive when asked during Wednesday’s leaders’ debate who would be education minister if the Coalition was re-elected. “It will be Alan Tudge,” Morrison replied. Government officials confirmed in early April that Tudge remained education minister and was “on leave” despite the acting minister, Robert, performing the functions of the role. Robert has rebuffed requests from Labor’s education shadow minister, Tanya Plibersek, for a pre-election debate on education policy. Robert told the ABC that Plibersek had left it too late to request such a debate. Plibersek then tweeted a letter she had sent to Morrison more than two weeks ago asking for clarity about whether Tudge or Robert should be her designated debating partner, given “ongoing uncertainty over who in your cabinet has responsibility for education policy”. “I am happy to debate either or both of your ministers,” Plibersek wrote on 22 April. Acting education minister @stuartrobertmp just said he won’t participate in an education debate and that I should’ve asked earlier. I did.#ausvotes pic.twitter.com/Y0KdP10lXo Earlier on Tuesday, a Sky News journalist located Tudge at the prepoll and conducted the first interview with the Liberal MP in many months. Questioned about Labor’s request for a debate, Tudge said Robert would be “the appropriate person to do that”. Asked why the Department of Finance was negotiating with Miller to receive a payment in excess of $500,000, Tudge said: “As the prime minister said, he’s unaware, I’m unaware. It’s a matter for the Department of Finance. “I have no information. I haven’t been called as a witness. I haven’t been asked to provide evidence and as the prime minister said, if it involved me, he would have been made aware and he hasn’t been made aware.”",News/Australia news,‘Had better days’: Alan Tudge’s single exchange with education department since standing down,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/had-better-days-alan-tudges-single-exchange-with-education-department-since-standing-down
5/12/2022,"Do not be fooled by the cheerfully chaotic atmosphere of Studio A. In the heart of Crows Nest on Sydney’s lower north shore, this is a place where serious art is being made for serious money. And with four finalists showing in the 2022 Archibald prize, Sydney’s only group studio for artists living with intellectual disability demands to be judged on its own merits. In just six years, Studio A has established a workplace where its artists’ unique visions of their worlds are shared, nurtured and finely honed to a level of uncompromising professionalism. Paintings, installations and sculptures are exhibited, critiqued and sold, and sit in major collections around the country in universities, corporate offices and at Artbank. Many of the artists earn respectable incomes from their work, and several have forged creative partnerships with design houses. One of them is Thom Roberts, who has the rare distinction of being hung in the Archibald two years running. His portrait of Studio A chairman, Shane Simpson, became the public face of the country’s most enduring annual art competition last year: the bespectacled, multi-eyed visage smiling down benignly from eight metre-high street banners. Roberts’ signature style – his subjects always sport four eyes – is just “Thom’s way” he says, as is his penchant for replacing the human nose with a foot or hand. “No, not being silly,” he tells the studio’s co-founder and artistic director, Gabrielle Mordy, as we discuss Roberts’ distinctive portraiture style. “But it’s fun.” Roberts successful 2022 entry is a portrait of ceramic designer Shelley Simpson, who Roberts calls Rachey, and who has become something of a collaborator with him. The work is painted on a porcelain disc created in Simpson’s ceramic studio, which produces high-end ceramics under the brand Mud Australia. “I like to paint people’s nose as a foot or a finger to make people laugh. It makes me laugh,” he said in the accompanying artist statement. Meagan Pelham, another Studio A Archibald finalist, has a long-running creative partnership with Sydney fashion house Romance was Born. Her loved-up owls have become one of the designers’ signature motifs, and her poetic musings on love are embroidered in sequins and beads on Romance was Born dresses and T-shirts. Pelham’s Archibald entry, a vibrant gouache and acrylic painting titled Romance is LOVE, is a portrait of Romance was Born co-founder Anna Plunkett. Sydney artist Emily Crockford is also in the running for the $100,000 prize for a second time, after a self-portrait became the studio’s first finalist in 2020. Since then, she has been named Hornsby’s Local Woman of the Year and was a New South Wales Woman of the Year nominee in 2021. Her second work to be hung in the Archibald exhibition pays homage to Studio A’s co-founders, Mordy and Emma Johnston, both practising artists themselves. The studio’s fourth Archibald finalist, Catherine McGuiness, also took inspiration from a fellow artist she has worked with, Rosie Deacon. Victoria Atkinson, who attracted national attention with her 2021 Archibald finalist portrait of federal Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman, reappears as a finalist in this year’s Sulman prize for object, subject or mural painting – which is also announced on Friday. Titled Angel Mum, Noel Humphrey, Atkinson’s painting on plywood is a touching memorial to her mother, who died last year. “I like to put lights on the painting because I think my mum’s spirit shines on me like the sun is on me every day,” Atkinson says in her artist’s statement. “I imagine my mum floating on the clouds in the sky.” Studio A is a not-for-profit arts organisation and social enterprise. Established in 2016, it aims to ensure neurodiverse artists have a voice in contemporary Australian culture, and have access to sustainable creative careers. With the public attention the Archibald inevitably brings, Mordy says the artists are finally getting the recognition they deserve – being exhibited alongside artworks created by people without disability, and subjected to the same curatorial discernment. “To this day, when I say I work with adults with intellectual disability, people think I work as an art therapist,” she says. “There’s this assumption that what we’re doing is just for recreation or some kind of therapy. “Something like the Archibald is kind of a milestone moment … it brings added credibility, a broadened professional recognition that shows an artist with intellectual disability can be a serious, talented and professional interpreter.” The winner of the 2022 Archibald prize will be announced at the Art Gallery of NSW on Friday.",Arts/Culture,Archibald prize 2022: the small Sydney studio breaking big ground,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/12/archibald-prize-2022-the-small-sydney-studio-breaking-big-ground-portrait-painting-art
5/12/2022,"An emergency alert has been issued for the Lockyer Valley in Queensland’s southeast, as several areas of the state continue to experience heavy downpours. The Queensland Fire and Emergency Services said heavy rainfall and flash flooding is expected to continue across the region for the next couple of days. Multiple roads have already been cut by the flooding and have road closures in place. Meteorologists also warned of major flooding at Laidley Creek, south-west of Brisbane, for Thursday morning, with minor to moderate flooding expected along Lockyer Creek, Bremer River, Warrill Creek and the Lower Brisbane River. Severe thunderstorms were forecast for Queensland’s central coast and Whitsundays region, with dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding also a possibility. Intense rainfall caused interruptions to transport and flooded dozens of roads across the state. All CityCat and ferry services were suspended in Brisbane, with totals of 50mm forecast for Brisbane on Thursday. Gold Coast beaches were closed as dangerous surf and huge swell were expected along the coastline. Flood waters claimed the life of a woman on Wednesday after a dual ute was swept into flood waters north of Mackay. Two passengers, a man and a woman, escaped the vehicle and were taken to hospital as a precautionary measure. It came after a man in his 20s was discharged from hospital on Wednesday after a dramatic rescue from flood waters in Mount Isa. The man was rescued from flood water on Monday after clinging to reeds along a river for half an hour. While the far west starts to dry out, the Bureau of Meteorology warned the rain would continue to fall. Heavy downpours and possible thunderstorms were forecast for the central, southern and south-east regions of Queensland on Thursday. “These could produce damaging wind gusts and also intense rainfall that could lead to life-threatening flash flooding,” meteorologist Christie Johnson said. “Moving into Friday, we see the focus move to the south-east and, after that, the system moves away to the east and conditions improve on the weekend.” Rainfall totals across the east of the state were generally between 50-70 mm, with areas between the Daintree and Mackay, the Sunshine Coast and central Queensland recording more than 100mm on Wednesday.
