For the first time, we are asking children to subject themselves to a possible danger in order to protect adults. All the other vaccinations are about protecting the children themselves. Alex I don’t have strong opinions about vaccinating children – I don’t have any of my own. My partner’s kids, who are 12 and 14, are getting vaccinated because they want to. Alison I was talking about immigration, how it must have been very hard for some of these little towns in eastern England, to find within 10 years that a child is in an extremely small minority of native English speakers in their class. She got that. Alex I was surprised by her perspective around eastern European immigration, because in other respects she seemed to be so open-minded. I didn’t feel offended on the part of my brethren. It was more surprise, because she seemed to be such a logical person – she voted to stay in. Alison This is a very small island and I just see the housing creeping in, greenfield sites being covered up – we’ve got a housing crisis. We talked about the way Britain creams off often highly qualified people. I mean, why are Nigerian nurses working here, when they are needed in Nigeria? Alex The way I approach it is that Britain, having been a colonial power, has had Windrush, plus Pakistani and Indian migration. Then there was European migration, but you can’t tell that they’re not from here until they start talking. Is it that there seems to be some deceit there that rubs people up the wrong way? Alison thought that was an interesting perspective. Alison The statue of Edward Colston should have been removed, but it was unfortunate in the way it was done. Alex I responded to a survey and said we should keep it in a museum. I don’t condone renaming everything that has a slave owner’s name attached to it, but it’s not my bone to pick and not my heritage. I would rather argue about the role of the British in the second world war, having come from a country that might not have been invaded if different decisions were made at the time. Alison Bristolians still talk about the Colston Hall, renamed last year. They should have information in the hall to explain who Colston was. Alison We talked a bit about how disgusting men’s toilets are but, for a lot of women, this is one of the issues [of the trans debate]. When you have a child in a buggy, mixed toilets – with single enclosed cubicles – are rubbish. Alex I didn’t disagree. Alison Of course trans people can exist. But I’m not willing to say trans women; I will say trans-identified men. Alex It’s undoubtedly difficult to be trans in this world – you are likely to be attacked for it. For me, the conversation that has built up around it in the media is disproportionate to what people experience in their life – though in no way do I want to minimise the experience of trans people. Alex It was a perfect illustration of someone who doesn’t think there should be eastern European immigration connecting with someone nearly three times younger and an eastern European immigrant. Everything is possible if you give each other a chance. Alison She was lovely, but then I never don’t get on with women. I might adopt her, although she does have a mother in Poland.

12/30/2021,"Chelsea have announced losses of £145.6m after tax for the year despite being crowned European champions in May. Thomas Tuchel’s appointment to replace Frank Lampard at the end of January transformed the team’s fortunes on the pitch as they went on to defeat Manchester City in the Champions League final.  But the club’s financial results for the year to 30 June 2021 have been severely affected by playing games with no crowds because of the Covid-19 pandemic, while there was also a reduction in profit on player sales. Chelsea’s turnover increased from £387.8m to £416.8m thanks to an increase in broadcasting revenue. But after posting a made a profit of £39.5m in the previous financial year, this year’s losses are significantly more than the £102m in the 2019/20 season. Chelsea’s accounts state they are “reliant on Fordstam Limited for its continued financial support”.

12/30/2021,"A BBC News interview with a lawyer accused of the sexual abuse of a minor after Ghislaine Maxwell’s conviction “did not meet the BBC’s editorial standards”, the corporation has said. The broadcaster has been inundated with complaints about the interview with Alan Dershowitz, which was broadcast on the BBC News channel shortly after Maxwell was found guilty of sex trafficking in a New York court on Wednesday.  Dershowitz, who was previously Jeffrey Epstein’s lawyer, has been accused of sexual abuse by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who has made similar claims against Prince Andrew. Both men deny the claims. When interviewed on the BBC News channel on Wednesday, Dershowitz was introduced simply as a “constitutional lawyer”. He was then allowed to attack Giuffre’s credibility, without challenge from the presenter. A BBC spokesperson said on Thursday that Dershowitz “was not a suitable person to interview as an impartial analyst, and we did not make the relevant background clear to our audience. We will look into how this happened.” In the interview, Dershowitz congratulated the prosecution in the Maxwell case for not calling Giuffre as a witness, “because they ultimately didn’t believe she was telling the truth and they didn’t believe a jury would believe her and they were right in doing so.” The BBC did not mention that Dershowitz and Giuffre are locked in lawsuits over the veracity of her claims that he was part of a group of powerful men to whom Epstein offered her for sex. She sued him for defamation after he called her a liar, and he counter-sued claiming she was making false claims about him as part of a plan to extort money from a far wealthier member of Epstein’s circle. The Labour MP Nadia Whittome tweeted: “Alan Dershowitz, who was accused of the same crimes as Prince Andrew, is on the BBC trying to silence victims following Ghislaine Maxwell’s conviction. I can’t believe this needs to be said but the BBC should not give a platform to people accused of child sexual abuse.” She added: “We have a responsibility to believe people when they disclose sexual abuse and to create conditions in which they can in the first place. All details of Epstein’s network should be published and all victims/survivors are owed justice. This is clearly the tip of the iceberg.” Sarah Churchwell, an American literature professor from the University of London, tweeted: “People have taken this thread as an opp to bash the BBC, so let me be clear I’m a fan and a beneficiary of brilliant people at @BBCNews. But this – Dershowitz as ‘constitutional lawyer’ without explaining his screaming conflicts of interest – is not OK.” Adam Wagner, a human rights barrister, said the interview represented a “huge error by the BBC” and that all the corporation had to do was search Dershowitz’s name on Google to see that he was not an appropriate guest. Caoilfhionn Gallagher, a coroner and human rights lawyer, said she was “shocked” and described the decision to interview him as “utterly bizarre”. The BBC statement said: “The interview with Alan Dershowitz after the Ghislaine Maxwell verdict did not meet the BBC’s editorial standards, as Mr Dershowitz was not a suitable person to interview as an impartial analyst, and we did not make the relevant background clear to our audience.

12/30/2021,"The Royal Navy is to dismantle a sunken warship in the River Thames containing 1,400 tonnes of unstable explosives. It is believed that if the unexploded ordnance on the SS Richard Montgomery were triggered it could lead to the nearby oil and gas facilities in Sheerness being damaged, the Daily Telegraph reports.  A Ministry of Defence report said that an explosion “would throw a 300 metre wide column of water and debris nearly 3,000 metres into the air and generate a wave 5 metre high”. The ship has remained a hazard in the shipping waters around Sheerness since it sunk on 20 August 1944. Its cargo of explosives in the forward holds has not been unloaded since. Masts from the wreck of the SS Richard Montgomery, beached in the sands below, have been pictured poking above the water. A no-entry exclusion zone extends around the wreck and a local port owner is responsible for marking the wreck with warning notices attached to the masts. Protective buoys circle the ship. It has been reported that a two-month Royal Navy operation to remove the masts will begin in June. A recent Department for Transport survey found the ship’s three masts were deteriorating and in a poor state. The MoD had warned that the unexploded ordnance could detonate if any of the ship’s masts collapsed. Previously the ministry had offered to pay £5m to any company which was able to safely remove the masts. Peel Ports, which operates Sheerness Docks, is responsible for marking and guarding the wreck with warning notices fastened to the masts and a circle of buoys around the ship. The seabed around the wreck was surveyed in October to check for spilled explosives before the dismantling of the masts begins. An MoD document reportedly seen by the Telegraph said: “An explosion impacting the local area including the nearby oil and gas facilities in Sheerness leading to mass damage and potential loss of life.” A spokesperson for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the risk of a “major explosion” was “remote”. Built in Jacksonville, Florida in 1943, the Richard Montgomery was originally used to take vital supplies to Europe and it sailed across the Atlantic in convoy. The ship went aground on a sandbank after the captain was ordered to anchor off the Great Nore. The water was too shallow and the ship got stuck as the tide fell. Attempts to unload the vessel were abandoned after stevedores and navy divers faced treacherous weather conditions and greater danger as the ship settled. After years of sonar surveillance, divers were again employed on site during a 2003 survey which involved an ultrasonic hull thickness analysis. An up-to-date assessment of the level of seabed support of the wreck was obtained and the status of a large crack in one of the main holds was obtained. In 2013, a hull thickness survey was repeated.",News/UK news,Navy to dismantle sunken warship on Thames holding unstable explosives,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/30/navy-to-dismantle-sunken-warship-on-thames-holding-unstable-explosives
12/30/2021,"The biggest shake-up to the insurance industry for decades takes place on Saturday, when insurers will be banned from quoting policyholders a higher price to renew their home or motor insurance than they would offer a new customer. After years of complaints that customers who regularly switched insurer were paying significantly lower premiums than those who renewed, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said they must be offered the same price.  The move is expected to be bad news for households that chase the lowest new-customer premiums annually. However, the FCA expects it to result in lower renewals for loyal customers who renew automatically, typically saving them £120 a year each. The FCA’s reforms follow a review that found insurers were attracting new customers with artificially low prices and then increasing premiums in subsequent years – a practice known in the trade as “price walking”. It also uncovered evidence that insurers were using sophisticated processes to attract customers who they thought were less likely to switch in future. As well as leading to higher prices for loyal – often older – customers who were less likely to switch suppliers, price walking had distorted the way the whole insurance market had worked, the FCA said. It has been particularly prevalent in the home insurance market where those renewing policies have routinely been charged double or even triple what they would have paid as a new customer of the same firm. Sheldon Mills, executive director of consumers and competition at the FCA, said the rules were expected to save consumers £4.2bn over the next 10 years. “Our interventions will make the insurance market fairer and make it work better. Insurers can no longer penalise consumers who stay with them. You can still shop around and negotiate a better deal, but you won’t have to switch just to avoid being charged a loyalty premium,” he said. “We are keeping a close eye on how insurers respond to our new rules, to ensure that the benefits of a better insurance market are delivered to consumers.” Martin Lewis, the founder of the MoneySavingExpert website, and one of those who helped to turn UK consumers into a nation of switchers, has predicted that price savings currently offered to regular switchers will fall. “My best guess is firms won’t just cut renewal prices to match those for newbies. Rates will meet nearer the middle as happened in 2012, when insurers were barred from gender price discrimination. This will mean savings from switching will likely relatively reduce. We’re still unsure of how this will work exactly, but prices for switchers are very likely to be relatively higher for January,” he said. The move has been welcomed by the Association of British Insurers, which said it will remove “excessive price differences in the premiums paid by some new and existing customers for the same policy”. Ursula Gibbs, director at the comparison website Comparethemarket.com, said it looked as though insurers had been playing “a clever pricing game” and keeping premiums lower in recent months to try to lock in as many customers as possible before new regulations were introduced. She said car insurance premiums had fallen by £80 a year over the past 12 months. “There is uncertainty over what will happen to the cost of car insurance next month. While the rule changes should end the loyalty penalty, this does not mean that auto-renewing your insurance will get you the best deal,” she said. If the FCA’s new rules do result in less switching, it will bad news for the comparison websites, coming at a time that the energy switching market has all but ceased to exist. The sites earn a considerable commission for each new customer they bring to an insurer.",Lifestyle/Money,Landmark UK insurance shakeup poised to benefit loyal customers,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/30/landmark-uk-insurance-shakeup-poised-to-benefit-loyal-customers
12/30/2021,"As new year approaches, crowds around the world may be expecting whizzes and bangs to light up the sky. But the appeal of fireworks could fizzle out with the growing use of drones for light shows. One notable example was the opening ceremony of this year’s Tokyo Olympics, while the Over the Top NYE event at Reunion Tower in Dallas is among those planning to combine fireworks and drones to welcome 2022.  They are also being embraced at a local level: more than 1,000 people watched a drone display at Mercia Marina in Derbyshire to celebrate Bonfire Night this year. Ollie Howitt, the creative coordinator at SkyMagic, which used a fleet of 300 drones to create a display for the mayor of London’s new year celebration last year, said demand had increased substantially, something the pandemic has helped accelerate. She added that drones were increasingly able to fly in greater density and for longer. “We do think it’s going to be something that’s ever evolving, as opposed to it being a short-lived sort of fad that people have suddenly got interested in,” she said. Robert Neff, a partner and general manager at Mercia Marina, also believes drone displays will become more common. “There’s a big movement against fireworks,” he said. Neff said the decision to use a drone display at the marina was down to a number of factors, including the impact of fireworks on animals – from wildlife and waterfowl to the cats and dogs of boat owners. “They’ve often commented on how much distress is caused to their pets by the fireworks,” he said. Howitt said there were benefits to drones: “They’re no emission, they’re reusable, there’s no fallout or any debris or that kind of thing. So in that sense they are a very good, sustainable option.” But not everyone agrees. A spokesperson from the British Fireworks Association said drones could also pose environmental problems. “Suggestions are that drones have less of an impact on the environment, but we have grave concerns about electrical demand and use of lithium batteries which are known not to be all that ‘green’,” they said. “Firework use impact on the environment has been shown to be minor and very short-lived and recent studies have suggested that there is likely to be more pollution from a couple of cars driving to an event than caused by fireworks at an event.” An RSPCA spokesperson said that while drones were a possible idea to try to reduce the impact of displays on animals, there were downsides. “Drones are not without their own negative issues such as spooking horses and livestock or colliding with birds, and can cause disturbance to animals and members of the public. It’s therefore important for their effects to be fully considered and measures taken to minimise the chance of accidents,” they said. And there are logistical issues with drone light displays, known as “drone swarms”, needing to receive specific safety approval from the UK Civil Aviation Authority. Some suggest the use of fireworks and drones are not mutually exclusive. The crackle and bangs of pyrotechnics create a sound sensation that is hard to replace. “We find fireworks work really well in tandem with drones. But we don’t really see it as a one replacing the other at all. We sort of feel as if it’s just another tool in the chest for how you sort of animate the sky and what you want to do with the show that you’re putting on,” said Howitt, noting that while fireworks give a loud, emotive, big performance, drones offer the chance to tell stories in the sky by using a series of images. But, as Neff noted, using drones to avoid the potential problems from fireworks involves people ditching the latter. “What people point out is why do you bother avoiding it if five miles or two miles down the road they’re having a big firework display,” said Neff. “It makes a bit of a mockery of it.” But he is not certain he would opt for drones again. “I don’t know,” he said, adding people were expecting rather more from the display. “They expected more drones, more lights, more performance. People always want more. And I think the noise is part of the big experience of it all,” he said.",News/Technology,Fireworks could fizzle out as drones rise in popularity for new year,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/30/fireworks-could-fizzle-out-drones-rise-popularity-new-year
12/30/2021,"When I say I’m a fan of canned beans, I mean I’m a stan of canned beans. A friend once joked that I could write a cookbook called Doing New Things With a Tin of Beans, which I very nearly mistook for a challenge. Nutritionally, they’re a powerhouse, but it’s their versatility that truly gives me life. I recently figured out that you can blend an entire tin of cannellini beans to make a silky-smooth double cream replacement, ideal for glossy pasta sauces such as this vegan penne alla vodka. Borlotti, on the other hand, are gorgeous and meaty when mashed with diced mushrooms and used like mince.  Don’t be tempted to mash the beans to oblivion - you want to have a chunky texture – so I’d advise against using a food processor, if you can help it. A fork or potato masher should do the job. Prep 15 minCook 45 minServes 4 For the ‘meatballs’1 x 400g tin borlotti beans, drained and rinsed60g panko breadcrumbs50ml boiling water2 tbsp vegan bouillon, or stock powder2 tsp vegan gravy granules (I use red Bisto, but strict vegans may prefer an alternative)1 tsp Marmite25g vegan butter or margarine1 medium onion, peeled and finely chopped85g shiitake mushrooms, finely chopped½ tsp fine sea salt½ tsp ground black pepper⅛ tsp ground nutmeg¼ tsp allspice1 tbsp vegetable oilFinely chopped parsley, to serveLingonberry or cranberry sauce, to serve For the gravy40g vegan butter3 tbsp plain white flour380ml vegetable stock150ml unsweetened and unflavoured soy milk In a medium bowl, mash the beans with a fork until each one is just broken up and the mixture is chunky; don’t mash it to a paste. Add the breadcrumbs and mix to combine. Put the boiling water, stock powder, Bisto and Marmite in a measuring jug and whisk smooth. Set a medium frying pan over a medium-low heat and add the butter. Once melted, add the onion and fry gently, stirring, for two minutes. As the chopped onion turns translucent, add the mushrooms, fry, stirring, for eight to 10 minutes more, then add the salt, pepper and spices, stir to combine and take off the heat. Add the onions to the mashed bean mix and stir to combine. With lightly wet hands, form the mixture into tablespoon-sized balls and put on a plate. Put the frying pan back on a medium heat and add the vegetable oil. Fry the balls in two batches for about 10 minutes each, turning them regularly, until lightly browned all over, then transfer to a plate while you make the gravy. Return the frying pan to a medium-low heat and add the butter. Once melted, whisk in the flour until you have a smooth paste. Add the stock bit by bit, whisking as you go, until smooth. Bring to a gentle simmer, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens into a rich gravy. Still whisking, add the soy milk in a slow, steady stream and, once the gravy is smooth and creamy, turn the heat to low and return the meatballs to the pan. Leave to simmer gently for a few minutes, stirring often to prevent the gravy from sticking, then serve with mashed potato or pappardelle, a sprinkle of fresh parsley and some lingonberry or cranberry sauce.

Meanwhile, bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil, add the penne and cook according to the packet instructions, until al dente. Once the sauce has reduced and thickened, stir in the cannellini cream, season to taste and keep warm. Once al dente, drain the pasta, reserving 150ml of its cooking water. Add the pasta to the sauce, turn the heat down low and toss to combine. Cook, tossing and stirring often, for two minutes, adding the reserved pasta water as required to loosen the sauce (you may not need all the water; use just enough to bring the sauce to your desired consistency).

12/30/2021,"Iam sure those who know my backstory of criminality imagine – reasonably – that the toughest times of my life were while I was a guest of Her Majesty, who kindly gave me full board and lodgings for 16 years, on and off, during the first six decades of my existence. And they are half right. My first taste of her hospitality came in 1957 when, at 14, I was ordered to spend three months in a detention centre. Then a relatively new concept, these were designed to give miscreants a “short, sharp shock” that would teach us to stay on the straight and narrow.  It didn’t work, of course, which I know because I met up with virtually all of the class of ’57 from Foston Hall, Derbyshire, in different jails and at different times. As for the teaching element, I was sent there for nicking a chewing gum machine. It was a bit of a lark, really, and a long way from the crimes that led to my last jail term: seven years, in 1996, for relieving Barclays Bank of a million pounds and producing counterfeit giro cheques of such high quality that the benefits system was forced to issue a new design; Post Office staff could not differentiate our cheques from theirs. (One for Michael “Prison works” Howard to think about.) I had a few difficult periods during those stays. I did frequent stints in isolation – and I was in prison when a diet of solely dry bread and water, for three days at a time, was a lawful punishment for misbehaving cons. No doubt I would have been birched, too, had that punishment not been abolished in 1962, a couple of years before I arrived in the adult system (for stealing a tray of rings from a jewellers). I have also been on the receiving end of bad – in fact, illegal – behaviour from staff, usually out of sight, in segregation units. When I was a witness to mistreatment, rather than a victim, I chose to call out the behaviour of staff. If my attitude landed me in hot water, I was always determined never to let my keepers see they were getting me down. I forced my feelings to follow my resolve. So, all in all, yes, I have served hard time. Yet somehow it never drove me near despair. You see, I chose to become a criminal; volunteered, if you like. I was steeped in crime, enjoyed my work and willingly signed up to the adage: “If you can’t do the time, don’t do the crime.” Accordingly, when mistakes occurred at work and I ended up in the slammer, I regarded it as an occupational hazard. The toughest time of my life, although occurring in prison, had nothing to do with the difficulties chronicled above. It took place while I was sailing serenely through a seven-year sentence in a civilised jail, HMP Risley. Around the back end of 1998, I received a letter containing disturbing news about a dear friend, who was struggling to cope with life on the outside. It had happened before – particularly badly in 1989 – but then I had been free and could be by his side. I more or less moved in with him, listened to him and sometimes laughed with him, encouraging him to think of good times we had enjoyed and could enjoy again. He eventually recovered and we did, indeed, spend some good times together. This time, however, there was no possibility of me going to him, and he had medical issues that prevented him from visiting me. All I could do was make phone calls and write letters until I was free – in about a year’s time. It was not enough. Perhaps nothing would have been. Ultimately, there were to be no more times, good or bad, spent together again. I had wanted to offer him my attention and constant presence, but I could not – and that was due entirely to my incarceration. When my loss of freedom hurt only me, I was happy to take the consequences, but I felt the full force of it when it affected my ability to help him. For the first time in my chosen career, I felt the powerlessness and impotence of captivity. To my mind, I had failed my friend. This was my nadir, my rock bottom. I coped, because you have to. Life moves on and time heals, but the episode left its mark. That was my last jail term to date. I have asked myself if it had any bearing on me going straight. The truth is, I don’t know. I didn’t commit any crimes between my release, a few days before the end of last century, and the almost accidental securing of my role as a Guardian journalist in 2003. But I had been away the best part of four years, so I was due a sabbatical, if you like, until I had adjusted fully to life outside the walls. Plus, my work in the latter stages of my career involved long-term planning. But crime has a strong pull; I sometimes miss the buzz of it. So I will never know. What I do know is that, 23 years on, I am in a much better place, physically and spiritually. It is a good feeling. I am in the 17th year of my journalistic journey and while, sadly, reporting doesn’t pay nearly as well as crime (and is considerably more stressful), it has one major perk: I know I will not be going back to that place of lowest point again. Instead, I am blessed with children and grandchildren, who bring me absolute joy (most of the time!), and a few dear friends. Some are old mates, who have been in my life for a long time, but now I am free to be in their lives, too, and for the foreseeable future. Finally, I am on hand, to cajole, praise, comfort and, yes, help, if needed. It is a good feeling – one I think about daily. Throw in a couple of rescue dogs and my happiness is complete. It looks as though I will not be accepting Betty Windsor’s hospitality again.

12/30/2021,"Public holidays are notoriously difficult for epidemiologists – people may avoid or delay both testing and hospital visits, making for slightly unreliable numbers. But some things are still clear from the latest Covid data released by the government. Omicron is now responsible for more than 90% of all new infections in England (the other three nations haven’t published a full set of data yet), meaning that its particular effects are now driving the pandemic. And its rate of growth versus earlier this month appears to have slowed considerably. It is barely three weeks ago that Omicron infections were more than doubling every two days. If that rate of increase had continued we would be close to 1 million infections per day by now. Even the Christmas holiday cannot explain the difference between that estimate and the most recent reported infection numbers for England of 117,000. On the other hand, hopes from before Christmas that we may have seen the epidemic peak were almost certainly premature. Overall cases are still increasing, and we haven’t seen the worst daily report yet, but the lower rate of increase means a lower eventual peak than previously thought.  Drilling down into the data we can see large changes in how the epidemic has moved through different age groups. In mid-December infections increased most rapidly in the 20-to-40 age group, however in the last few days before Christmas there was a dramatic slowing in the rate of increase in that group. By contrast infection rates in the 50+ age group were relatively flat for the first half of December but in the 10 days before Christmas the rate of increase in infection rates in this age group increased substantially. This older age group is far more likely to be admitted to hospital, and so admissions have risen in recent days, as has the number of beds occupied by people with Covid in England: currently 9,546 compared to 6,434 two weeks previously, a 48% rise. But the number of patients with Covid occupying mechanical ventilation beds remains fairly level and is actually below what it was a few weeks ago. The most recent data for England was 758 on 28 December, compared to 795 two weeks previously. Deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test are still falling slightly, but we would not expect to see any impact on the death statistics from the recent rapid rise in Covid for another couple of weeks. How the next few weeks – never mind the next few months – play out in the UK is still far from clear. Even though the Omicron variant appears to be less severe than Delta, and for many the infection is just a mild, cold-like illness, that is clearly not the case for all. Ultimately the amount of pressure on the NHS will depend on how many people become ill enough to be admitted to hospital and that will depend on how high infection rates go, especially in the older age groups. If, as was the case in South Africa, cases increase very rapidly, peak and fall rapidly then the pressure on the NHS may be short-lived and manageable. But the epidemic in the UK may not follow what happened in South Africa. So where does this leave us with knowing how to best manage as we move beyond new year? It all depends on how much pressure Omicron will place on the health service at its peak and how long that period of high demand lasts. We probably won’t know until a week or so after the holiday period what is likely to happen in January and beyond. Interventions and measures that reduce the transmissibility of an infection will reduce the peak but are often associated with a longer-lasting epidemic – people who are susceptible simply become infected later, rather than all at once. In other words, social distancing measures may not prevent but only delay infections. In addition to reducing the height of the peak – and thus the immediate pressure on the health service – there can be other important gains from delaying infections, especially if new treatments or new vaccines are expected that will substantially reduce death or severe disability. This time, though, there is nothing likely to make a big difference expected soon. Another complicating factor is that the effectiveness of the vaccines versus infection declines with time. Recent data from the UK Health Security Agency suggests that the protective effect of the booster shot may be waning after about 10 weeks. Its effectiveness against severe disease is more durable than effectiveness against mild infection, but will still decrease with time. As always, interventions are a matter of fine timing. It is still not clear how this new Omicron-dominant wave will play out. Earlier this week the UK government chose not to introduce new measures before the new year, instead adopting a wait-and-monitor approach as long as hospitalisations remained relatively low. The US CDC recently reduced the recommended isolation period for people with a positive Covid test – but no symptoms – from 10 to five days. This may indicate a new preference for less restrictive policies if soaring infection numbers no longer necessarily mean mass hospitalisation and death.

12/30/2021,"Jimmy Anderson wants English cricket to row back on its aggressive recent push towards the white-ball formats in recent years and has insisted it is now down to the senior players to lift a Test squad that is currently flat after its Ashes humbling. A trip that began with Anderson believing his final tour of Australia might replace the memories of the 4-0 loss in 2017-18 has now moved into a zombified state, with England 3-0 down and the two remaining Tests in Sydney and Hobart now a case of playing for pride and World Test Championship points.  Chris Silverwood, a head coach few expect to remain in place after an error-strewn tour, will miss the first of these while isolating due to a positive Covid case among his family, while three members of his support staff – Jon Lewis (seam bowling), Jeetan Patel (spin) and Darren Veness (fitness) – have the virus. As well as resulting in a lack of slingers in the nets, an outbreak that also has also seen three family members infected represents the latest headache for a side that trail 3-0 and has caused an eruption of opinions about English cricket’s priorities. Speaking at training on Thursday, Anderson initially stressed the need for minds inside the camp not to dwell on the broader issues with two Tests remaining, only for the 39-year-old to then decide he wanted to get something off his chest. “What I will say is, I think that there has been a big push with white ball cricket since the 2015 World Cup,” said Anderson “So I just would like to think that maybe [a better] balance between red- and white-ball cricket is there, going forward. At the minute, it’s tipped slightly towards white-ball. And it has been for the last few years. “If you look at our performances in Test cricket over the last few years, they’ve been pretty inconsistent. So, from that point of view we can hopefully just redress that balance a little bit.” Asked if the standard of County Championship cricket has dropped during his 20-year professional career, Anderson replied: “There’s a bit more cricket now, I guess. There are more competitions to think about. I think that the one thing for me is that potentially the wickets aren’t as good as they used to be. You see a lot more result pitches now in county cricket. So perhaps, with the bigger picture, that’s something we can think about in the future.” One would hope the words of England’s record Test wicket-taker – now up to 639 victims after the immaculate four for 33 at the MCG that proved in vain – might resonate higher up at the England and Wales Cricket Board, so, too, captain Joe Root calling for a “reset” in red-ball cricket in the wake of defeat. However, the governing body’s leadership is currently in flux, with headhunters having been dispatched to fill the currently vacant role of chair and a chief executive in Tom Harrison who presided over the past five years and may well leave after the end of the financial year when a £2.1m bonus pot matures and is split by senior executives. Next summer’s domestic schedule is currently being devised and a third round of the County Championship may move into the middle of summer after last season’s shemozzle. But with the Hundred in place, and no competition in men’s cricket having made way, first-class cricket will still largely get second-class treatment. Fresh leadership at the top cannot come quickly enough, although Root is likely to remain as captain of the Test team for the time being due to scant alternatives. “Everyone thinks so highly of him,” said Anderson. “Not just as a bloke but as a cricketer, and as a captain. So yes, hopefully he will continue. “We’re aware we’ve got so much good support around the world, people getting up in the middle of the night to watch and we’re gutted we’re not performing for those people and giving them what they want to see.” Asked about the motivation now, Anderson added: “The lads are pretty flat at the minute if I’m being brutally honest. It can be difficult, especially for guys experiencing the Ashes for the first time. That’s where the more senior players come in. We have to rally round, make sure everyone is in a good place and a good headspace to compete. “I know I said it last time but I would be extremely surprised if I was here in four years time. Obviously I didn’t want [the 4-0 defeat in 2017-18] to be my last memory of Australia, so I came back here and this is going to be it. We’ve just not been at the races. We’ve now got two games to do something about that.”",Sport/Sport,Anderson pleads for England to focus on red-ball cricket after Ashes debacle,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/30/jimmy-anderson-pleads-for-more-england-focus-on-red-ball-cricket-after-ashes-debacle
12/30/2021,"Pleather trousers, locket necklaces and Natural Born Killers T-shirts: during this holiday season, Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly cemented their 2021 fashion status with a familiar look – matching styles. The pandemic has had a regressive effect on fashion: shoppers swapped their office uniforms for tracksuit bottoms and in lieu of any fashion trends that stuck, we clung to the past, reviving looks from the 60s, the 70s and Y2k.  One of the most unexpected revivals has been the trend of celebrity couples dressing alike. In the late 90s and early 00s we had Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears in double denim, Victoria and David Beckham in matching Matrix-inspired leather jumpsuits, and even the likes of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, and Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher jumped on the bandwagon. Once again, in 2021, celebrity couples started dressing in complementary outfits. Leading the trend was the reconfigured Bennifer (Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez), reunited after nearly two decades apart (they initially broke up in 2002). The duo signalled their togetherness with matching fashion choices. Their last public outing, earlier this month, saw them twinning in PG-13 sky blue. And where they led, others followed. From Justin and Hailey Bieber in pumpkin-coloured coats to the aforementioned Fox and Kelly, and Blink-182’s Travis Barker and Kourtney Kardashian, Bennifer underlined the importance of creating a brand identity through a matching wardrobe. “This behaviour is about performative couplehood,” said Prof Alison Goodrum from Norwich University of the Arts. Goodrum says the pandemic has altered the way couples express their closeness in public. “In a changed world where public displays of affection, touch and physical proximity are discouraged, couples have turned to alternative ways of signalling their partnerships.” Shared wardrobes reveal intimacy but can also signal changes in public personas. When Kardashian and Fox began dressing as goth-punks (like their respective beaux, Barker and Kelly), they got a boost, adding elements of edginess and danger to their images. “Complementary dressing is rarely something that occurs without planning or intent,” says Goodrum. “Dressing alike is a useful tool for any red carpet couple to employ in the development or enhancement of their personal branding. It is a shorthand to signal messages about their lifestyle, preferences, status and even ideologies.” But what does it say when a star with a strong personal identity starts to dress to complement their partner’s attire? In August, the jewellery retailer Tiffany hired Beyoncé and Jay-Z, dressing them in matching evening attire, in a conscious effort to attract a younger customer to the luxury brand. The effect seemed at odds with Beyoncé’s unique brand of independence and self-love. “Fashion is often regarded to be a material means of self-expression and individuality, so there is a curious contradiction that surrounds both the idea and the practice of couple-dressing in this regard,” says Goodrum. “To dress in an intentionally similar manner to someone else may be considered by some to be problematic, a threat to one’s authentic self, a loss of one’s identity or a denial.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,"From Bennifer to the Biebers, stars step out in matching outfits again",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/dec/30/from-bennifer-to-the-biebers-stars-step-out-in-matching-outfits-again
12/30/2021,"The health secretary, Sajid Javid, has warned MPs he may need to “constrain” the Covid testing system over the next fortnight, as demand for lateral flow kits surges. Ministers have repeatedly encouraged members of the public to test themselves using a lateral flow device (LFD) before attending gatherings or meeting vulnerable relatives.  However, test kits have repeatedly been unavailable online in recent days, and many pharmacies have complained of being unable to secure them. Labour has accused the government of presiding over a “shambles”, with many members of the public struggling to obtain tests despite ministers putting testing at the centre of efforts to control the spread of Omicron. Demand for the tests has also been boosted by a change in quarantine rules that allows people to emerge from self-isolation after seven days instead of 10, as long as they carry out two negative lateral flow tests. In a letter sent to MPs on Wednesday evening, Javid acknowledged the intense strain being put on the system as cases of the Omicron variant continue to increase, with 183,037 new infections recorded on Wednesday. “In light of the huge demand for LFDs seen over the last three weeks, we expect to need to constrain the system at certain points over the next two weeks to manage supply over the course of each day, with new tranches of supply released regularly throughout each day,” he wrote. Javid reiterated the advice that the public should take a test “when engaging in activities that carry the greatest risk, and before coming into contact with people at risk of serious illness”. He said MPs should suggest that constituents unable to source testing kits online or find any at their local pharmacist, should, “see whether their local authority is distributing tests” or seek them out at local community facilities, such as libraries. “I would like to thank your constituents for their continued understanding and patience during this unprecedented time,” he wrote. Javid underlined the action the government has taken to increase the supply of LFDs, with 300m expected to be available in January, up from the 100m planned before the Omicron variant was discovered. Amid warnings that the PCR tests used to confirm new cases of the virus have also been unavailable in many parts of the country, Javid also stressed that capacity for these has increased significantly, from 530,000 a day in November to up to 700,000 a day. Unlike in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, ministers at Westminster have opted not to place new restrictions on the public before new year. There is mounting concern among NHS leaders about their capacity to deal with surging cases, however. Data published on Wednesday showed there were 10,462 patients in hospital with Covid in England. That was the highest figure since March, although it is unclear how many were admitted with the disease and how many are there for another reason while also testing positive.",News/World news,"Lateral flow tests to be ‘constrained’ over next two weeks, warns Sajid Javid",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/lateral-flow-tests-to-be-constrained-over-next-two-weeks-warns-sajid-javid
12/30/2021,"As a trickle of tourists slowly returns to Egypt, the floating nightclubs along the Nile are back in business. And belly dancers are once again in high demand. The glitzy late-night shows attract visitors from all over the world, and especially from the Gulf’s Arab states, with dancers in revealing outfits performing with full traditional musical backing.  But while many dancers are happy to be getting back to work, there is growing disquiet that the artform is becoming closely associated with drinking and nightclub culture. They feel that the belly dance, which is deeply rooted in Egyptian history, has been increasingly seen as more akin to strip dancing, and that this association is making life difficult for the dancers. “What we’re seeing more and more of is this dance being hidden in these underground cabarets and bars,” says Egyptian dancer Amie Sultan. “A normal Egyptian family who wants to go to the theatre and watch a show will never see this dance.” As part of a campaign to change perceptions of the traditional artform, Sultan has launched a bid to have Egyptian belly dance included on Unesco’s Lists of Intangible Cultural Heritage. Although the dance is hugely popular – it is common to see belly dancers at Muslim and Christian weddings and star performers are celebrities in their own right – Sultan says they are seen more often as sex workers than artists. In Egypt’s conservative society, dancers face intense social stigma, and even risk prosecution for wearing outfits deemed too promiscuous by the authorities. “A mother will hire a dancer for her son’s wedding,” says Sultan, “but she’ll never let her daughter become a dancer.” Born in Singapore, Sultan began her dancing career in ballet. When she moved her focus to belly dance in 2014, she was shocked by a culture where performers compete to wear more revealing costumes and often undergo cosmetic surgery and breast augmentations. “I don’t even like the term ‘belly dance’,” says Sultan, who now teaches what she prefers to call Egyptian dance. Belly dance, she says “is a term that was invented by the French colonialists in Egypt. They took it back to France and called it danse du ventre [dance of the stomach], but we never call it that in Arabic.” Her programme for young dancers is run along similar lines to ballet training. Students are taught to dance in the style of stars from Egypt’s “golden age” of cinema, such as Samia Gamal and Naima Akef, and to distance themselves from the more sexualised styles found in nightclubs, where Sultan says the traditions have been diluted with other dance styles. Associating belly dance with sex work can make life difficult for dancers. Women trying to break into it as a career risk alienation from their families, insecure accommodation at the mercy of suspicious landlords, and sexual harassment. Unscrupulous managers have been known to push dancers into sex work. Dancers can also fall foul of the government’s strict regulations on attire. In 2019, a Russian woman was sentenced to a year in prison for breaching the dress code. Dance teacher Ali Abdelfattah says belly dancers are stigmatised in a way that doesn’t affect other professional dancers. “The ballet is seen as something graceful,” he says, “but when people see belly dancers, it throws up a lot of question marks. It’s not a good image.” Abdelfattah says that most of his students attend his workshops without their families’ knowledge. Because of the difficulties faced by Egyptians, many of those dancing in clubs, cabarets and at weddings come from abroad, especially from Russia and South America. Lurdiana, a Brazilian dancer working in Cairo, says she was recruited to belly dance in Sharm el-Sheikh. “They need dancers here,” she says. Even within the industry, Egyptian dancers face difficulties. Lurdiana’s former manager once explained his preference for foreign dancers. “He said that if an Egyptian girl works as a belly dancer, it means she doesn’t come from a good family or have a good education,” she says. “They think that she just does it because she wants to get money and doesn’t have any other options. They can’t imagine that she would do this just because she loves it.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,‘Belly dance is being hidden in Egypt’: the performer hoping for Unesco heritage status,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/dec/30/belly-dance-is-being-hidden-in-egypt-the-performer-hoping-for-unesco-heritage-status
12/30/2021,"From filters to bags to balls, the number of products aimed at stopping the torrent of microplastic fibres being flushed out of washing machines and into rivers and oceans is increasing rapidly. Grundig recently became the first appliance manufacturer to integrate a microfibre filter into a washing machine, while a British company has developed a system that does away with disposable fibre-trapping filters.  Entrepreneurs are also tackling the problem at source, by developing biodegradable fabrics from kelp and orange peel, and tweaking a self-healing protein originally discovered in squid tentacles. Microplastic pollution has pervaded the entire planet, from the summit of Mount Everest to the deepest oceans. People are known to consume the tiny particles via food and water, as well as breathing them in. Microplastics have been shown to harm wildlife but the impact on people is not known, though microplastics do damage human cells in the laboratory. Fibres from synthetic fabrics, such as acrylic and polyester, are shed in huge numbers during washing, about 700,000 per wash cycle, with the “delicates” wash cycle actually being worse than standard cycles. An estimated 68m loads of washing are done every week in the UK. New data from 36 sites collected during The Ocean Race Europe found that 86% of the microplastics in the seawater samples were fibres. “Our data clearly show that microplastics are pervasive in the ocean and that, surprisingly, the major component is microfibres,” said Aaron Beck, at the Geomar Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel, Germany. Grundig, which launched its fibre-catching washing machine in November, said the system caught up to 90% of synthetic fibres released during wash cycles. The filter cartridges are made from recycled plastic and last for up to six months, after which they can be returned free of charge. A system that can be retrofitted to existing washing machines and does not need replacement cartridges has been created by the British company Matter, and was recently awarded £150,000 from the British Design Fund. The device, called Gulp, is connected between the outflow pipe and the drain and traps the fibres in a container that is emptied every 20 washes. The company’s founder, Adam Root, a former Dyson engineer and keen scuba diver, said the idea had started with a £250 grant from the Prince’s Trust. “I used it to take apart a washing machine and that’s when I had my ‘eureka’ moment.” In the UK, Alberto Costa and other MPs are campaigning for a new regulation requiring all new washing machines to be fitted with plastic microfibre filters from 2025, backed by the Women’s Institute and others. France has introduced the requirement for filters to be fitted from 2025. The EU, Australia and California are considering similar rules. There are already a range of microfibre-catching devices on the market, but they have produced a mixed performance in independent testing. Research from the University of Plymouth in the UK examined six different products. One stood out, Xfiltra, which prevented 78% of microfibres from going down the drain. The company is focused on providing the technology to manufacturers to integrate into washing machines. The scientists tested two other devices that can be retrofitted to machines – the Lint LUV-R and Planet Care filter systems – but these trapped only 25% and 29% of fibres respectively. The three other products tested were used in the washing machine drum. The Guppyfriend washing bag, into which clothes are placed, collected 54% of microfibres, while a prototype washing bag from Fourth Element trapped only 21% of fibres. The last product tested was a single Cora ball, the stalks of which ensnared 31% of the fibres, though more than one ball could be used. An earlier report from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency found significantly better performances from the Planet Care and Guppyfriend products, although it was not peer reviewed. Prof Richard Thompson, who works at the University of Plymouth and was part of the testing team, cautioned that filters would not solve the problem of plastic microfibres alone. “We have also shown that around 50% of all fibre emission occurs while people are wearing the clothing,” he told the Guardian. “Also, most of the human population don’t have a washing machine. “As with nearly all the current problems associated with plastic [pollution], the problem is best fixed by more comprehensive consideration at the design stage,” he said. “We need to design these in order to minimise the rate of emission, which should also make the clothing last longer and hence be more sustainable.” A dozen groups working on better fabrics were recently shortlisted as finalists in a $650,000 (£482,000) microfibre innovation challenge being run by Conservation X Labs. AlgiKnit is creating biodegradable yarns from kelp, a type of seaweed, while Orange Fiber in southern Italy is making fabrics from the byproducts of citrus juice production. Another finalist, Squitex, has developed a protein originally found in the tentacles of squid. The company says it is the world’s fastest self-healing material and can be made into fibres for textiles and coatings that reduce microfibre shedding. Other finalists are taking a different approach. Nanoloom is creating non-shedding fabrics using graphene and another group is using high-powered lasers to treat the surface of fabrics to make fibres less likely to be lost. Cotton, as a natural material, is biodegradable, but its production often involves the overuse of water and pesticides. The Better Cotton Initiative, which covers more than 20% of global cotton production, recently announced a target of cutting carbon emissions per tonne of cotton by 50% by 2030, compared with 2017. Further additional targets covering pesticide use, soil health, smallholder livelihoods and women’s empowerment are expected by the end of 2022.",News/Environment,Companies race to stem flood of microplastic fibres into the oceans,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/30/companies-race-to-stem-flood-of-microplastic-fibres-into-the-oceans
