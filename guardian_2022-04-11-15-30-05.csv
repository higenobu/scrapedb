4/11/2022,"There’s a line Michelle Yeoh delivers in Everything Everywhere All at Once that surely resonates with everyone in this day and age: “Very busy today – no time to help you.” The internet has broken us. Inundated with information (and misinformation), we’re overwhelmed and emotionally exhausted. Notifications chime at all hours, the scroll never ends. We seek solace not in others but in our devices – portals to our curated bubbles of content and community. “There’s something about modern life that feels resonant with a multiverse story,” says Daniel Scheinart, half of the directing duo known as Daniels. “Everyone’s in their own little universes. We’re all logging into social media and discovering these subcultures that are sometimes really beautiful and fascinating, sometimes nightmarish and conspiracy-laden. It’s a very confusing experience.” That confusion is the basis for Daniels’ Everything Everywhere All at Once, which is already inspiring a frenzy of breathless praise: It’s being heralded as the year’s first great film and almost instantly became Letterboxd’s highest-rated film ever just from its limited release (not to mention box-office numbers and sold-out theatrical engagements rarely seen since before Covid). Harried laundromat proprietor Evelyn (Yeoh, in a career-defining role) is at rock bottom, with her relationships with her husband (Ke Huy Quan, in a resplendent return to film) and daughter (Stephanie Hsu) frayed nearly beyond repair, when a dreaded meeting with a ruthless IRS agent (Jamie Lee Curtis) reveals the existence of an imperiled multiverse that only Evelyn may be able to save. Such a summary does little favor to a manic, madcap film packed with pop-culture references, cringe-worthy body humor and breakneck kung fu choreography that also manages to be genuinely moving, inspiring a heart-soaring optimism that reaffirms the primacy of kindness and human connection in the face of an everything-bagel black hole of nihilism. All to say, as many have, the title delivers. Following their 2016 flatulence-and-erection-driven Swiss Army Man, Scheinert and Daniel Kwan set their sights on doing their version of The Matrix. In both of their features, human bodies manage to transcend their realistic mortal forms, becoming vessels for something much greater than what they can do in real life. That stems from the directors’ shared love of dance and physical comedy, which became a valuable vocabulary between the pair, who started out as music-video directors telling stories without dialogue. Via Zoom, Kwan holds up a copy of Kurt Vonnegut’s 1973 novel Breakfast of Champions, which explores the premise of genuine free will: “When we started directing, I really hated the job. I felt like I was just controlling these humans, forcing them to recreate something in my head.” Like Swiss Army Man, in which a corpse reveals itself to be a Swiss Army knife of tools for the protagonist, Daniels’ video for Foster the People’s Houdini embodies a similar anxiety, with record label cronies manipulating band members’ cadavers before a jubilant crowd. But Kwan notes that they’re beginning to move away from this guilt about puppeting toward something more optimistic. “Rather than vessels with no autonomy to be controlled, what a beautiful gift to have all that possibility, to be a vessel to hold anything.” Including hot-dog fingers, which Evelyn is horrified to find herself saddled with in one universe. “We wanted to play an empathy game with our audience and come up with a universe that Evelyn would really not want to be in – one that’s visually gross, where she’s in love with her least favorite person – and then see if we can make the audience and our main character see the beauty in it,” Scheinert explains, before laughing that that’s how they talked Curtis and Yeoh into those scenes when the actors voiced skepticism. Much of the film is told through the eyes of first-generation immigrants trying to make sense of this country, navigating bureaucracy, doing taxes, trying to socialize and do business with other Americans. Kwan didn’t originally intend to feature so prominently a Chinese American immigrant family, but it followed naturally given the genre: among their favorite films were those of Jackie Chan, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and, of course, The Matrix, which placed Hong Kong action choreography front and center. Seeing a martial-arts through line, they realized they could cast Asians as protagonists. “How exciting would that be?” Kwan recalls thinking. From there, they began to write what he knew. His father’s family emigrated from Hong Kong and opened laundromats in New York; he remembers his grandparents’ apartment just above their laundromat. Everything Everywhere draws heavily from the heyday of Hong Kong cinema that both Daniels are so fond of. After the first draft, Scheinert saw how much Stephen Chow’s nonsensical brand of slapstick had influenced their writing. “He was one of the first Asian film-makers that I fell in love with who really combined tones in a shocking way,” he says, remembering the impact of 2001’s Shaolin Soccer. “Those movies are so upsetting and brutal right after being hysterically funny like Looney Tunes.” Not to mention Jackie Chan and his trademark playful combat sequences involving the use of everyday objects as weapons. ​“Who didn’t love Jackie Chan in the 90s?” Kwan notes, with Scheinert pointing out, “Everyone fell in love with him, and then Hollywood didn’t learn his lesson on how to make action clear and precise and fun and funny. It’s so wild that his work made such a splash here and was so rewarding and yet that style of action then just disappeared.” When Daniels began writing Everything Everywhere, a story centered on an Asian American family was far from a recipe for Hollywood success. Yeoh first met with them two weeks before the release of Crazy Rich Asians; no one was certain how it would be received. Kwan recalls Yeoh remarking then, “You guys are taking a lot of risks with this movie. It’s very brave to center this big action movie around a Chinese family.” Five years ago, an Asian American in the industry who read their script provided a colorful, Pokémon-evolution-inspired metaphor that has remained with Kwan. “They said the Bulbasaurs of Asian American film are like Joy Luck Club or The Wedding Banquet – important stories that no one was telling at the time about a very specific cultural narrative. Because of those earlier films, we’re now able to watch things like Crazy Rich Asians and Shang-Chi, with Asian Americans starring in our own genre films – those are the Ivysaurs of Asian American cinema. And our film is a Venusaur.” Everything Everywhere could only exist because of those predecessors, he maintains: “This movie shows that Asian American cinema can be anything it wants to be.” And it happens to coincide with the recent releases of Kogonada’s After Yang and Domee Shi’s Turning Red. All three “basically echo the same feeling,” Kwan says, “which is we’re going to tell whatever story we want to tell.” Ultimately, Kwan has great hope for the growing inclusivity of American cinema: “I’m very excited for the next five to 10 years. Hopefully, every single marginalized community gets this opportunity to announce themselves and be like, ‘Look, I know that the narrative is usually this, but there’s so much more to us.’” So far Everything Everywhere has received such a resounding response that one suspects there’s something more at play than just what’s on screen. “The whole idea for the film came from watching everything get polarized and pushed in every separate direction,” Kwan says. “Everyone’s feeling this stretch. And this film was an attempt to hold the worlds together and imagine a place where everything actually all belongs and exists for a reason – where things aren’t this chaotic, terrifying mess but instead a beautiful mass filled with possibility. I think people need to hear that right now.” Everything Everywhere All At Once is out now in the US with a UK release to be announced",Arts/Film,"Michelle Yeoh, martial arts and the multiverse: inside the year’s wildest movie",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/11/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-michelle-yeoh
4/11/2022,"Video game developers are champing at the bit ahead of an influx of money from some of the biggest technology companies in the world as they compete to build a “Netflix for games”. At the centre of the contest are Microsoft and Sony, followed by less gaming-centric companies such as Apple, Amazon and Netflix who have all launched subscription services in an attempt to entice gamers on to their platforms. Microsoft has spent four years building up its flagship subscription, Xbox Game Pass, which offers unlimited access to more than 100 games for its Xbox family of consoles for a £10.99 monthly fee. In March, Sony announced plans to compete directly with Game Pass with a raft of changes to its PlayStation Plus service, which will eventually launch with 700 titles for £13.49 a month (or £99.99 a year), though largely focused on older titles. Alongside the two console manufacturers, a host of companies have launched similar services. Apple Arcade, for the iPhone and Apple TV, offers unlimited access to 200-plus mobile games for £4.99 a month; Amazon’s Luna service, currently in early access in the US, lets subscribers stream 100 games for $5.99; and Netflix is experimenting with offering a selection of games for free alongside its movies and TV shows. The competition has resulted in an influx of cash to the industry. Microsoft, the second richest company in the world, has been on an acquisition spree, buying the Call of Duty and Warcraft publisher Activision Blizzard, the Skyrim developer Bethesda and nine independent studios since 2017 alone. Amazon and Apple, the fourth and first richest companies in the world, have similarly deep pockets. Sony, with a market cap an order of magnitude smaller than the tech titans, has struggled to keep up, merging with the Halo and Destiny developer Bungie earlier this year. Even those who have stayed independent have welcomed the new model, in which game developers paid a significant sum upfront to put their games on the services, greatly reducing the risk of launching a new title on to digital storefronts where it can sink without a trace. “For a lot of actual indie developers, someone that is self-publishing a game by themselves, the chance of making it as a success by just putting it out there is pretty low,” says Tom Davis, of the Swedish indie publisher Thunderful. “By being able to actually get your game in front of the 25 million people that are subscribed to something like Game Pass or this new PlayStation Plus thing, it actually benefits sales as well – because people are just generally talking about the game.” Tom Mead, an art director and co-founder of Bristol-based Spiral Circus, says the deals with the platforms are “actually quite a positive thing, because it means that you can be paid properly to develop the ideas that you want, without necessarily having to worry about whether your game sells a bunch of copies at the end of it.” There’s widespread hope too that the rise of subscription services will usher in a change in focus for the industry, away from multimillion-dollar AAA titles towards smaller quirkier titles that aren’t intended to gel with everyone in the world. “Look back at Blockbuster,” says a producer at a major publisher who asked not to be named because of the commercial sensitivity of their dealings with the platforms. “I would go to Blockbuster on a Friday, not even knowing what games are out there, to look at a bunch of physical games and pick one up for the weekend. With Game Pass, everyone’s just picking everything up, and they might only play it for a few minutes, but they’ve got the option to see if it’s for them.” There are fears for the future, too. One developer who left a Silicon Valley giant to go independent says they’re worried about what happens when Sony’s money runs out. “It’s working while they’re struggling for platform dominance,” they say – but if one platform wins the fight, could payments to developers be cut even as subscription fees get increased? But even those with little to gain from the model agree it’s currently working for gamers. Super Rare Games is a British company that sells physical copies of previously download-only titles, and Ryan Brown, the company’s “head of words”, argues that the two approaches can coexist. “I use those services, they’re undeniably incredibly convenient. But for the people that feel like it, myself included, there are games that they’re going to want to be able to play in 50 years’ time, and that’s what physical games in general provide: ownership that you can’t have with a subscription.”",Arts/Games,Video game developers set for cash influx as tech firms compete for deals,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/apr/11/video-game-developers-cash-influx-tech-firms-compete-deals-netflix

4/11/2022,"One of the first things you should do is get a realistic idea of how much you’re likely to be able to borrow so you can see if it is worth going ahead. This will depend on three main things: your income, your outgoings and the size of the deposit you plan to put down. There are lots of mortgage affordability calculators online which will give you a flavour of the size of loan you might be able to get. The government-backed MoneyHelper website has one, as do many banks, mortgage brokers and comparison websites. When you come to apply, the lender will carry out a detailed affordability assessment to work out what you can afford to repay based on your income and spending commitments. Lenders also currently have to “stress test” your ability to repay if interest rates were to go up or there was a major change to your circumstances such as being made redundant or having a baby. Well ahead of applying for a mortgage, check your record with one or ideally all three of the main credit reference agencies: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. This will alert you to any problems that might lead to you being turned down or offered a less competitive mortgage rate, such as a default on your file relating to a missed payment. In some cases you may be able to resolve these before you apply for a home loan, at which point the lender will carry out its own check. Make sure your record is accurate and up to date, and dispute anything you don’t agree with. You can use a notice of correction to explain special circumstances behind previous arrears or defaults, such as a spell of illness. The agencies typically offer several ways, free and paid-for, to check your credit record or score. For example, subscribing to the Credit Karma website lets you see your TransUnion score for free. Keep a close eye on your credit record in the run-up to applying for a mortgage. During this time, try to avoid applying for any other borrowing such as loan or overdrafts if possible, as this could put off a mortgage lender. Also, try to steer clear of buy now, pay later deals when shopping, as this is a form of credit that will increasingly start to appear on people’s files. Payday loans are bad news – some mortgage lenders will turn you down if you’ve had one within the past 12 months. A mortgage lender will typically insist on seeing your last three months’ bank statements as part of its affordability checks, says Nick Mendes​ at the mortgage broker John Charcol. The lender will go through them with a fine-tooth comb to check you are financially healthy and can afford the repayments. So there is a strong argument for cutting back on your spending and reducing or clearing any overdraft. “It’s worth tightening your belt in the months before you apply,” says the website MoneySavingExpert.com. That maybe means cutting back on the non-essential extras that show up on a bank statement, such as rounds at the pub, takeaways and pricey coffees. You may want to go further and ditch things such as regular payments to Netflix, Spotify and the like. Check your statements carefully. Are you paying for things you no longer use or need, or that can be obtained cheaper elsewhere, such as mobile phone insurance that you took out years ago? If so, ditch them. Traditionally the typical maximum for how much someone can borrow is four-and-a-half times their annual income. This is known as the income multiple. If this is lower than you would like, the good news is that, with house prices having shot up over the last few years, some lenders have started offering higher income multiples. Halifax and Barclays are among those that will go up to 5.5 times income for high-earning borrowers. The mortgage lender Habito will go up to seven times salary in some cases. Meanwhile, a new lender called Perenna plans to launch mortgages of up to six times salary, and is inviting people to join its waiting list. One of the toughest tasks facing would-be homeowners is saving up a deposit – it can take years. Halifax said in January that the average UK first-time buyer deposit in 2021 was almost £54,000 and represented 20% of the purchase price. There are now more mortgages available that only require a 5% deposit than there were at the start of the pandemic. But if there is any way you can save up more than 5%, this will open the door to a bigger choice of deals and lower interest rates. For example, at the moment, fixed-rate mortgages where you borrow 90% of the property’s value are typically about 0.4 -0.5 percentage points cheaper than ones where you borrow 95%. Some buyers will be able to boost their deposit by turning to “the bank of mum and dad” or other family or friends for help. The lifetime Isa lets you save for a first home costing up to £450,000. You can put away up to £4,000 each year until you are 50 and the government will add a 25% bonus to your savings, up to a maximum of £1,000 a year. To open one you must be aged 18 to 39. Meanwhile, you can no longer open a new help-to-buy Isa, but if you already have one, you can pay in up to £200 a month, and the government will top up your savings by 25% (up to £3,000) when you buy your first home. Make sure you are registered on the electoral roll at your current address. Lenders use it to confirm who you are. Not being on it could lead to some turning you down. With so many deals to choose from, some homebuyers may feel they need someone to hold their hand. A mortgage broker can survey the market and help you to find a deal that’s right for you. It’s probably a good idea to use one if, say, you have past credit issues or your employment or financial situation isn’t straightforward. There are a number of mortgage brokers offering fee-free advice including London & Country (L&C).",Lifestyle/Money,How to get yourself mortgage ready,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/11/how-to-get-yourself-mortgage-ready
4/11/2022,"“Enjoy it while you can”: how I’ve come to dislike these five little words, which have followed me everywhere since my pregnancy became obvious. Suddenly, they are applied to anything pleasurable – sleep, holidays, a meal in a restaurant. “Enjoy it while you can,” people say (because when the baby comes, your life as you know it will be over). They mean well, I think, but I’ll confess that I’ve been shocked by the negativity surrounding parenthood. People seem to feel that they simply must tell you how hard it is, warts and all, maybe because no one told them, and they do it with the zeal of missionaries: they have seen the truth, and it is terrible to behold. Hollie McNish has a book of poetry about parenthood called Nobody Told Me. Mine would be called Everybody Told Me, All the Time, Until I Had to Ask Them to Stop. Before I had the baby, it’s not that I thought parenthood was going to be a breeze – I just wanted to hear a tiny bit of positive feedback about it. During pregnancy you realise pretty quickly that, for your own sanity, you will need to avoid certain subjects. In the early months, tales of miscarriage seemed to be everywhere (and this is after all the tales of fertility woe, which, in my case anyway, led to the belief that it would be near-impossible to get pregnant). If you get to 12 weeks, suddenly stories about foetal anomalies seem to spring up. And after that it’s stillbirths, traumatic labours, sepsis, death. I found myself desperate to read a story along the lines of: “Woman conceives child naturally, only to carry and give birth to said child without complications.” This is not to be flippant about the very real suffering of many women, which for decades was cloaked in shameful silence. Pregnancy and birth can be dangerous and traumatising, particularly for women but also for men. Part of the reason that we are seeing these stories now is because the cult of motherhood positivity felt so suffocating. Among my friendship group are women and their partners who have suffered traumatic births, pregnancy loss and postnatal depression. Some people have become parents during the pandemic, with all of the unique challenges that poses. I have listened to their testimonies and, I hope, supported them. These conversations are often long and nuanced, and feature moments of joy as well as pain. They perhaps reflect better the experience of parenthood than many articles are able to. No, it is the strangers who seem to present the most negativity. It is as though they think pregnant women are wandering blindly into parenthood and must be shown the light. The implication is that before embarking on this journey, we lived carefree existences without responsibility. But this is not the reality for everyone: for example, when I was a child I was a carer for my brother. Others will have nursed loved ones through illness and death, or supported them through periods of mental illness. It may not be an identical experience to that of being a parent, but there are many ways to care, and to express that care. Others who are childfree exercise their caring impulses through their family and community networks, through fostering, volunteering, political activism. Or perhaps, snotty as the pope has been about this, they care for animals. We are all a part of a collective of which caring is a crucial part. At least, that’s how I see it. Some frame parenthood as a dividing line – on the one side those who embark upon it, on the other those who don’t. But I’ve never seen it that way: I prefer to choose solidarity. People often say that when you are pregnant, you become public property. In Making Babies, Anne Enright writes of how, during her pregnancy, she felt she became a sort of vessel for other people’s projections. “Everyone’s unconscious was very close to their mouth,” she writes. “Whatever my pregnant body triggered was not political, or social, it was animal and ancient and quite helpless.” Perhaps, in all the parenting negativity, we are seeing an overcorrection. An attempt to be more honest about the challenges that has spilled over into a tide that, at times, can feel overwhelming, especially to those who are prone to anxiety or have suffered from mental illness. I found myself clinging to the stories of those few strangers who smiled at my news and told me of their parenting joys: the cabby who picked me up from my first midwife appointment and told me how much he loves being a dad; the woman on holiday who vividly described nursing her son, how his little dark eyes would lock with hers so that they felt like the only two people in the world. Whenever I heard another “Enjoy it while you can”, I held on to these snippets and tried not to panic. What is working: I read in Philippa Perry’s excellent The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read about some studies showing the benefits of eating chocolate in pregnancy. Not only does it apparently reduce the likelihood of pre-eclampsia, but women who ate chocolate daily during pregnancy had babies that smiled and laughed more than those who hadn’t. This makes me feel even better about my near-daily trip to the nearby brownie stall. What isn’t: Packed off to triage with high blood pressure that turned out to be caused by white coat syndrome, I see a woman’s waters break in the waiting room. “Oh shit,” she says, “my trackies.” She’s put in the bay next to mine. “This is the most pain I have ever been in,” she yells, ensuring my blood pressure remains as high as ever. “They do say that labour is painful,” her partner says, as we each contemplate ways in which we would kill him. “I mean, that shouldn’t come as a surprise. They do tell you that, babe.” Birth partners: just because you’re thinking it doesn’t mean you should say it.

4/11/2022,"The first all-women media house in Somalia has been launched, creating a rare opportunity for female journalists in the country to research and publish stories they want to tell. Led by one of the few female senior news producers in the country, the team of six will produce content for TV, radio and online media on issues such as gender-based violence, women in politics and female entrepreneurs. Crucially, they will have the autonomy to make editorial decisions. “We want to cover these issues and challenge societal beliefs that women should stay at home,” said the editor-in-chief, Nasrin Mohamed Ahmed, who has worked as a journalist for 12 years and is a founding member of the Somali Women Journalist Organisation. Women working in the media in Somalia face multiple challenges, from being ignored and denied promotions to bullying and sexually harassment. “Men think you should come in, read the news and go home,” said Ahmed, 27. Bilan’s deputy editor, Fathi Mohamed Ahmed (no relation), 25, said sexual harassment was rife in the media sector and she has had to develop tactics to ward off advances from male colleagues. “The biggest challenge facing female journalists in Somalia is abuse, especially from male journalists,” she said. “They offer to help you but only if you give them something in return.” Ahmed added: “Men have said things to me like, ‘you’re beautiful, I like your body’, and it was only when I said I was engaged that they stopped.” Bilan, which means bright and clear in Somali, will be based in the capital, Mogadishu, at Dalsan Media Group, one of the country’s largest media organisations. It will publish news and features, and provide training and mentorship from established Somali and international journalists, including the BBC’s Lyse Doucet and Razia Iqbal, Channel 4’s Lyndsey Hilsum and Mohammed Adow at Al Jazeera. Six-month internships will be offered to the best final-year female journalism students at two universities in Mogadishu. Funded by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the project is a year-long pilot, but Jocelyn Mason, UNDP’s resident representative in Mogadishu, is confident it will become a permanent set-up, and may also be extended into Somalia’s regions. “We hope this will be a gamechanger for the Somali media scene, opening up new opportunities for women journalists and shining a light on subjects that have been ignored, particularly those that are important for women,” said Mason. The team at Bilan includes a woman who is leaving her family for the first time to work in Mogadishu. “I come from a rural clan which does not want any of its members to become journalists, especially young women,” said Shukri Mohamed Abdi. “We come from the bush, where the concept of being a journalist does not exist.” Another member of the team, Kiin Hasan Fakat, grew up in one of the three Dadaab refugee camps in Kenya. She hopes Bilan will provide a safe and inspiring environment for women to tell their stories. “Ask any Somali who they depend on. They will always say ‘my mother’.

4/11/2022,"Jodie Sharp’s days were all broken up the same way. “I smoked to go to work, smoked to do the washing-up, smoked for chill time.” Smoking marijuana “was a totally regular habit and every time I did it, I was smoking in exactly the same way, getting the same experience all over again.” Sharp used a little metal pipe, and she often ran her tongue over the hard skin on her lip where the pipe sat. Her lungs hurt, her gums bled. She slept poorly and had no dream function. “I thought, ‘This is crazy. Why am I doing this at this time of my life?’” She was 60, a self-employed market researcher, and had been smoking marijuana for most of her adult life. But one day, waiting on the corner for her weekly £60 bag of weed, she saw herself from the outside, and felt “sick and tired” of what she saw. Later that week, she typed “weed withdrawal” into a search engine. The questions on the Marijuana Anonymous homepage were confronting. Has smoking weed stopped being fun? Do you smoke alone? Do you smoke to deal with anxiety? At her first meeting, Sharp explained that she wanted to stop. Although the meeting felt good, she wasn’t ready to give up, believing marijuana eased her arthritis. She bought CBD oil but after three weeks “was back on weed”. This was not how it was meant to be. At 17, when Sharp and her friends crumbled cannabis resin into their joints, marijuana felt countercultural, a “rebellion against our parents’ way of life”. She became “a stoner”, travelled. But then weed became “ubiquitous, nothing to do with counterculture. You smell it everywhere in London,” she says. Her horizons narrowed. When did she realise she was addicted? “That’s tricky, because somewhere inside I knew – probably after I’d been smoking for 10 or 15 years. I knew how I felt when I didn’t have it.” In her early 30s, she says, “I used to get restless, irritable, discontent. What’s missing, you know?” Each time she felt like that, her mind reached for marijuana. Sharp thinks now that “fear dominated my life. I was so anxious. I felt I had to control everything. That has always been my drive: I have to be in control.” That urge “comes from childhood,” she says, “from feeling abandoned. Because my mother wasn’t able to give me the love that she … I don’t want to use the word should, but, you know, would have naturally given me, had her mental health not been so poor. Here I am at 62 years old trying to deal with that.” Sharp’s family has a history of alcoholism, and her fear was further amplified when a friend of her teenage child overdosed on a cocktail of drugs last May. “It frightened us both,” Sharp says. “I used to do my usual stuff. Pipes and things … I wasn’t really there for my child.” Now she thought, “‘What the hell am I doing?’ I just wanted to feel safe.” But instead of giving up smoking, she switched back to resin. It was a random inconvenience two months later that proved transformational. A supply problem meant Sharp went two days without smoking. There was no conscious decision to abstain, but she accepted the accident. On the second day, she was out celebrating her brother’s eighth “sobriety birthday”. “I turned to him and said, ‘I haven’t smoked in two days.’ He said, ‘You should be getting to a meeting.’ That was the moment. It was like a switch had been thrown.” Sharp did go to a meeting and, nine months on, she is on step four of the Marijuana Anonymous 12-step programme. Steadily, she is teaching herself: “The only thing you can control is how you react to things.” She has not touched “any mood or mind-altering substance” since. At first, life began to change in small ways. “I was able to contemplate the whole day.” Time stretched before her, unpunctuated by smoking. “I got clearer thoughts. My sleep got better. I enjoyed food. I began to dream again.” Most of all, she says, she lives now with “an amazing feeling of freedom and happiness.

My partner wanted to own a 50% share of the property so we had the house valued and used the middle of the three valuations which was £240,000, so she gave me a cash amount of £120,000. I decided to pay off the outstanding mortgage using money from her £120,000 cash. I am now concerned that my partner should have contributed to paying off the existing mortgage as if I had decided to keep the mortgage she would have had to contribute to the monthly mortgage figure. It was my partner’s suggestion to pay off the mortgage using money from the £120,000 she had given me. Have I been misled here? It is really worrying me, any advice you could give me would be appreciated. We did get a solicitor to put in writing that she owned 50% of the property but there were no details of how she became entitled to the 50%.AB A No you have not been misled, and I don’t understand why you think she should have contributed to paying off the mortgage. She wanted to buy a half share in the property and did so by paying you £120,000. If she had paid off half the mortgage as well as paying you £120,000 in cash, her share in the property should have increased to just over 58% because she would have effectively paid you £140,000. I also don’t understand why you think that your partner should have contributed to the monthly mortgage repayments if you had not paid off the mortgage. That would be a reasonable assumption only if she had taken on half the mortgage – so £20,000 of it - and paid you only £100,000 in cash for her 50% share, making a total contribution of £120,000. If anyone should be worried it is your partner. If I were her, I would want to know not just that a solicitor put it in writing but that same solicitor added her name at the Land Registry.

4/11/2022,"Can you please ask RAC car insurance why it won’t pay my claim, because I have got to the point where I simply don’t know what to do. On 4 December last year I had a no-fault accident. I have dashcam footage showing the other driver pulling out in front of me. The police attended, and I have witness statements showing I was not at fault. After reporting the claim I was told that a company called Markerstudy would be dealing with it. Two weeks later, I received a text telling me my car was to be written off. I was then informed that, in fact, the RAC would process it. I was then contacted by a third company called IMS Solutions which told me it was now dealing with my claim. After a long wait it informed me that it wasn’t getting anywhere with the third party’s insurer, and said I should go back to the RAC. Today, RAC told me that it won’t deal with this and gave me the number of another company – you guessed it, Markerstudy! This has now been going on for almost four months, when I have been without a car, or a settlement. My car was only worth £2,800. The way this claim has been handled is completely ridiculous. It’s as though they are deliberately making it as difficult as possible. I am now at the end of my tether. JC, Wallingford Twenty years ago, you paid your insurer for cover and if you had to make a claim then it would process it and pay out. Today, it feels like the whole claims process has been subcontracted out to endless companies that most people have never heard of – firms you have no contract or relationship with, firms that are often near impossible to contact. We have had several similar letters complaining about insurers in recent months, making the same point as you. Your letter shows how dysfunctional the whole process has become, and had I not intervened, I suspect it could have taken you another four months to get your payout. The RAC says: “We have investigated JC’s concerns and would like to apologise for the time it has taken for his claim to be resolved. “We have spoken to the parties involved and are pleased to say we have now resolved the claim. We have given him a payment of £150 for the time it has taken to process the claim.” In January, Markerstudy bought BGL Insurance, which provides the RAC’s and others’ policies, for a reported £400m. It also owns Co-op Insurance. Trustpilot and other reviews of Markerstudy and Co-op Insurance make for quite shocking reading, with poor claims handling the main complaint from customers. Your experience is not unusual, it seems. Asked about the reviews for its companies, Markerstudy blamed claim delays on “ongoing supply chain issues” and says it has recruited 40 staff to improve matters. “We are working with all our partners, insurers and providers to try and minimise disruption to customers,” it says.

4/11/2022,"Julian Barnes has always enjoyed blurring the boundaries between fiction and nonfiction, writing novels that sound like works of history or criticism. His new novel, riddling to the point of reader-denying, devotes a third of its short length to a 50-page essay on historical views of the Roman emperor Julian the Apostate, who was thwarted in his attempt to ditch Christianity and return Rome to pagan worship.The essay’s author is the book’s narrator, Neil, a twice-divorced soap actor turned mushroom grower, who writes in memory of Elizabeth Finch, a lecturer who taught a year-long evening class he attended in London on the subject of “culture and civilisation”. He never submitted his final essay, instead asking Elizabeth, whose hauteur arouses much intrigue among her students, out to lunch. So began a 20-year routine of biannual lunch dates that lasted until her death, when she left her papers,among them notes for an essay on Julian, to our narrator.As Neil sets out to finish the job, an early reference to The Golden Legend, “that medieval assemblage of miracles and martyrdoms”, puts the unready reader on notice (that presumptuous “that”). So too do the words of Elizabeth’s brother, “pink-cheeked and plump”, who tells Neil he’s “not a literary chap in any way. Though I like a good yarn.” It’s one of several hints that such a thing is far from Barnes’s goal: ditto Neil’s confession that “the voyeur in me wondered if [Elizabeth] had left a laceratingly self-revealing diary… my tawdry imagination was no better than those of the loucher students she had taught”.The novel confuses the reader’s sense of what is and isn’t significant with a steady drumbeat of caveats – regarding Elizabeth’s romantic life or Neil’s divorces – that turn the narrative into a series of false starts; it’s typical when he begins a sentence by saying “In my case” only to cut himself off (“but my case isn’t relevant”). As a reading experience, it’s akin to answering a cold call only to find yourself put on hold, which isn’t to say there aren’t funny moments. After a female ex-classmate says “life… does not amount to a narrative”, Neil tells us that he loves women “who are more intelligent, or more lucid, than me”; next minute, he’s asking if she’s ever slept with a woman, before trying to seduce her himself. Trouble is, the comedy inflicts collateral damage on our ability to gauge how reliable a guide Neil is to his overall subject, not least because Elizabeth seldom seems the purveyor of 24-carat wisdom she’s made out to be (“Life is both necessary and unavoidable”? “Constitutional democracy is the least worst system we’ve so far discovered”?).One passage finds Neil on a train reading Michel Butor’s 1957 novel La Modification (A Changing Heart), whose narrator, also on a train, is reading about none other than Julian the Apostate. Neil’s growing impatience with Butor’s tricksy refusal to make the anticipated connections between narrator and subject echoes our own frustrations. In other words, Barnes couldn’t make it any clearer that he knows exactly what he’s doing; the question is, why is he doing it?If you squint a bit, Elizabeth shares a shred of DNA with Barnes’s friend Anita Brookner, who died in 2016, and to whom Barnes paid tribute in terms that presage Neil’s discussion of Elizabeth’s high seriousness (“‘Anita, what do you think of Ireland’s chances in the Six Nations?’ was not a question that ever came to my lips”). Viewed this way, the novel’s in-jokes grow: Neil’s scorn for the “crude idea” of writing Elizabeth’s biography might amuse another of Barnes’s friends, Hermione Lee, currently at work on a life of Brookner, and his editors at the London Review of Books, where Barnes writes regularly, would probably enjoy Neil’s summary of the publication’s reputation as “a nest of leftists, subversives, pseudo-intellectuals, cosmopolitans, traitors, liars and anti-monarchist vermin”.In the end, I couldn’t help wondering if Barnes had taken perverse inspiration from Martin Amis’s autobiographical novel Inside Story, having read it, perhaps, on high alert for a cameo of the sort he made in Amis’s memoir Experience, which reported their bitter, mid-90s falling-out. Here is a Julian-centred narrative likewise shaped by a woman’s enigmatic magnetism, albeit cerebral, not carnal, in a roman à clef that keeps the clef tucked firmly under a plant pot by the back door, rather than jangling it à la Amis. Pure projection, no doubt, but Barnes is smart enough to know that readers faced with so astringent a novel may well find themselves forced to make their own fun.

4/11/2022,"At first glance, last autumn’s Glasgow climate summit looked a lot like its 25 predecessors. It had: A conference hall the size of an aircraft carrier stuffed with displays from problematic parties (the Saudis, for example, with a giant pavilion saluting their efforts at promoting a “circular carbon economy agenda”). Squadrons of delegates rushing constantly to mysterious sessions (“Showcasing achievements of TBTTP and Protected Areas Initiative of GoP”) while actual negotiations took place in a few back rooms. Earnest protesters with excellent signs (“The wrong Amazon is burning”). But as I wandered the halls and the streets outside, it struck me again and again that a good deal had changed since the last big climate confab in Paris in 2015 – and not just because carbon levels and the temperature had risen ever higher. The biggest shift was in the political climate. Over those few years the world seemed to have swerved sharply away from democracy and toward autocracy – and in the process dramatically limited our ability to fight the climate crisis. Oligarchs of many kinds had grabbed power and were using it to uphold the status quo; there was a Potemkin quality to the whole gathering, as if everyone was reciting a script that no longer reflected the actual politics of the planet. Now that we’ve watched Russia launch an oil-fired invasion of Ukraine, it’s a little easier to see this trend in high relief – but Putin is far from the only case. Consider the examples. Brazil, in 2015 at Paris, had been led by Dilma Rousseff, of the Workers’ party, which had for the most part worked to limit deforestation in the Amazon. In some ways the country could claim to have done more than any other on climate damage, simply by slowing the cutting. But in 2021 Jair Bolsonaro was in charge, at the head of a government that empowered every big-time cattle rancher and mahogany poacher in the country. If people cared about the climate, he said, they could eat less and “poop every other day”. And if they cared about democracy, they could … go to jail. “Only God can take me from the presidency,” he explained ahead of this year’s elections. Or India, which may turn out to be the most pivotal nation given the projected increases in its energy use – and which had refused its equivalent of Greta Thunberg even a visa to attend the meeting. (At least Disha Ravi was no longer in jail). Or Russia (about which more in a minute) or China – a decade ago we could still, albeit with some hazard and some care, hold climate protests and demonstrations in Beijing. Don’t try that now. Or, of course, the US, whose deep democratic deficits have long haunted climate negotiations. The reason we have a system of voluntary pledges, not a binding global agreement, is that the world finally figured out there would never be 66 votes in the US Senate for a real treaty. Joe Biden had expected to arrive at the talks with the Build Back Better bill in his back pocket, slap it down on the table, and start a bidding war with the Chinese – but the other Joe, Manchin of West Virginia, the biggest single recipient of fossil fuel cash in DC, made sure that didn’t happen. Instead Biden showed up empty-handed and the talks fizzled. And so we were left contemplating a world whose people badly want action on climate change, but whose systems aren’t delivering it. In 2021 the UN Development Programme conducted a remarkable poll, across the planet – they questioned people through video-game networks to reach humans less likely to answer traditional surveys. Even amid the Covid pandemic, 64% of them described climate change as a “global emergency”, and that by decisive margins they wanted “broad climate policies beyond the current state of play”. As the UNDP director, Achim Steiner, summarized, “the results of the survey clearly illustrate that urgent climate action has broad support amongst people around the globe, across nationalities, age, gender and education level”. The irony is that some environmentalists have occasionally yearned for less democracy, not more. Surely if we just had strongmen in power everywhere they could just make the hard decisions and put us on the right path – we wouldn’t have to mess with the constant vagaries of elections and lobbying and influence. But this is wrong for at least one moral reason – strongmen capable of acting instantly on the climate crisis are also capable of acting instantly on any number of other things, as the people of Xinjiang and Tibet would testify were they allowed to talk. It’s also wrong for a number of practical ones. Those practical problems begin with the fact that autocrats have their own vested interests to please – Modi campaigned for his role atop the world’s largest democracy on the corporate jet of Adani, the largest coal company in the subcontinent. Don’t assume for a minute that there’s not a fossil fuel lobby in China; right now it’s busy telling Xi that economic growth depends on more coal. And beyond that, autocrats are often directly the result of fossil fuel. The crucial thing about oil and gas is that it is concentrated in a few spots around the world, and hence the people who live on top of or otherwise control those spots end up with huge amounts of unwarranted and unaccountable power. Boris Johnson was just off in Saudi Arabia trying to round up some hydrocarbons – the day after the king beheaded 81 folks he didn’t like. Would anyone pay the slightest attention to the Saudi royal family if they did not possess oil? No. Nor would the Koch brothers have been able to dominate American politics on the basis of their ideas –when David Koch ran for the White House on the Libertarian ticket in 1980 he got almost no votes. So he and his brother Charles decided to use their winnings as America’s largest oil and gas barons to buy the GOP, and the rest is (dysfunctional) political history. The most striking example of this phenomenon, it hardly need be said, is Vladimir Putin, a man whose power rests almost entirely on the production of stuff that you can burn. If I wandered through my house, it would be no problem to find electronics from China, textiles from India, all manner of goods from the EU – but there’s nothing anywhere that would say “made in Russia”. Sixty per cent of the export earnings that equipped his army came from oil and gas, and all the political clout that has cowed western Europe for decades came from his fingers on the gas spigot. He and his hideous war are the product of fossil fuel, and his fossil fuel interests have done much to corrupt the rest of the world. It’s worth remembering that Donald Trump’s first secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, wears the Order of Friendship, personally pinned on his lapel by Putin in thanks for the vast investments Tillerson’s firm (that would be Exxon) had made in the Arctic – a region opened to their exploitation by the fact that it had, um, melted. And these guys stick together: it’s entirely unsurprising that when Coke, Pepsi, Starbucks and Amazon quit Russia last month, Koch Industries announced that it was staying put. The family business began, after all, by building refineries for Stalin. Another way of saying this is that hydrocarbons by their nature tend towards the support of despotism – they’re highly dense in energy and hence very valuable; geography and geology means they can be controlled with relative ease. There’s one pipeline, one oil terminal. Whereas sun and wind are, in these terms, much closer to democratic: they’re available everywhere, diffuse instead of concentrated. I can’t have an oilwell in my backyard because, as with almost all backyards, there is no oil there. Even if there was an oilwell, I would have to sell what I pumped to some refiner, and since I’m American, that would likely be a Koch enterprise. But I can (and do) have a solar panel on my roof; my wife and I rule our own tiny oligarchy, insulated from the market forces the Putins and the Kochs can unleash and exploit. The cost of energy delivered by the sun has not risen this year, and it will not rise next year. As a general rule of thumb, those territories with the healthiest, least-captive-to-vested-interest democracies are making the most progress on climate change. Look around the world at Iceland or Costa Rica, around Europe at Finland or Spain, around the US at California or New York. So part of the job for climate campaigners is to work for functioning democratic states, where people’s demands for a working future will be prioritized over vested interest, ideology and personal fiefdoms. But given the time constraints that physics impose – the need for rapid action everywhere – that can’t be the whole strategy. In fact, activists have arguably been a little too focused on politics as a source of change, and paid not quite enough attention to the other power center in our civilization: money. If we could somehow persuade or force the world’s financial giants to change, that would yield quick progress as well. Maybe quicker, since speed is more a hallmark of stock exchanges than parliaments. And here the news is a little better. Take my country as an example. Political power has come to rest in the reddest, most corrupt parts of America. The senators representing a relative handful of people in sparsely populated western states are able to tie up our political life, and those senators are almost all on the payroll of big oil. But money has collected in the blue parts of the country – Biden-voting counties account for 70% of the country’s economy. That’s one reason some of us have worked so hard on campaigns like fossil fuel divestment – we won big victories with New York’s pension funds and with California’s vast university system, and so were able to put real pressure on big oil. Now we’re doing the same with the huge banks that are the industry’s financial lifeline. We’re well aware that we may never win over Montana or Mississippi, so we better have some solutions that don’t depend on doing so. The same thing’s true globally. We may not be able to advocate in Beijing or Moscow or, increasingly, in Delhi. So, at least for these purposes, it’s useful that the biggest pots of money remain in Manhattan, in London, in Frankfurt, in Tokyo. These are places we still can make some noise. And they are places where there’s some real chance of that noise being heard. Governments tend to favor people who’ve already made their fortune, industries that are already ascendant: that’s who comes with blocs of employees who vote, and that’s who can afford the bribes. But investors are all about who’s going to make money next. That’s why Tesla is worth far more than General Motors in the stock market, if not in the halls of Congress. Moreover, if we can persuade the world of money to act, it’s capable of doing so quickly. Should, say, Chase Bank, currently the biggest lender on earth to fossil fuel, announce this year that it was quickly phasing out that support, the news would ripple out across stock markets in the matter of hours. That’s why some of us have felt it worthwhile to mount increasingly larger campaigns against these financial institutions, and to head off to jail from their lobbies. The world of money is at least as unbalanced and unfair as the world of political power – but in ways that may make it a little easier for climate advocates to make progress. Putin’s grotesque war might be where some of these strands come together. It highlights the ways that fossil fuel builds autocracy, and the power that control of scarce supplies gives to autocrats. It’s also shown us the power of financial systems to put pressure on the most recalcitrant political leaders: Russia is being systematically and effectively punished by bankers and corporations, though as my Ukrainian colleague Svitlana Romanko and I pointed out recently, they could be doing far more. The shock of the war may also be strengthening the resolve and unity of the world’s remaining democracies and perhaps – one can hope – diminishing the attraction of would-be despots like Donald Trump. But we’ve got years, not decades, to get the climate crisis under some kind of control. We won’t get more moments like this. The brave people of Ukraine may be fighting for more than they can know.

4/11/2022,"Victoria’s transport infrastructure minister, Jacinta Allan, has given Barnaby Joyce a spray at their first meeting since the Nationals leader took over the federal infrastructure portfolio, telling him “Victorians are Australian taxpayers as well”. The duo opened the $324m Echuca-Moama Bridge on the Victoria-New South Wales border on Monday, in what was their first meeting since the deputy prime minister became infrastructure minister in June last year. Guardian Australia understands Allan had requested a meeting with Joyce since that time. A meeting of the nation’s infrastructure and transport ministers scheduled for December was postponed twice, before it switched from an in-person meeting to online. Several items on the agenda for the meeting, held on 11 February, were also removed. The same day, Joyce announced $600m in funding for Paradise Dam in Queensland, while Allan was represented in the meeting by state transport minister, Ben Carroll. Asked by a reporter if he was “hard to nail down”, Joyce replied: “I’ll let the Victorian minister speak for herself, but phones worked in both directions last time I checked.” “If you want to call me, I’m there. If people need money off the commonwealth, we’re there. Canberra is just up the road there. It’s not too hard to get to, there are flights every day,” he said. “I’m only too happy to meet all my ministers and it’s not parochialism. I work all the time with Rita Saffioti, the Labor [infrastructure] minister in Western Australia, making sure that we build the infrastructures not only in Victoria but across our nation.” Allan responded by saying the way Joyce “manages his diary is frankly a matter for him”. “I have been prepared to meet with each and every one of the various infrastructure ministers that have sat around the federal cabinet table over the seven years that I’ve been the infrastructure minister here in Victoria,” she said. Allan said the state had been forced to “go it alone” on projects such as the Metro Tunnel and West Gate Tunnel. “If these were projects in New South Wales, we’d be getting 50% of funding for those projects. We’re not getting our fair share here in Victoria, and we will continue to press that point, regardless of the infrastructure minister or the government in Canberra,” she said. “I simply remind the deputy prime minister that Victorians are Australian taxpayers as well.” Allan also criticised the federal government’s latest budget, which allocated about 5.9%, or $208m, out of a total $3.56bn worth of new infrastructure funding over the four-year budget period to Victoria. Victoria is also only state without a city deal with the commonwealth and has been left out of a $7.1bn regional economies fund.

4/11/2022,"Agleaming adventure playground where smaller visitors can hurl themselves down a super-size coal chute. Gentle shire horses. An old-fashioned sweet shop… Blists Hill Victorian town, the open-air museum in Shropshire, easily captures my sons’ attention, but it’s a different exhibit that makes me pause. In a hangar-like space I spot the beefy black hull of the Spry. The only complete surviving Severn trow – these distinctive barges once shuttled stone, coal and iron downriver to Cardiff and Bristol, and in shallow waters were hauled back up with ropes. It’s a vivid reminder of what this stretch of the Severn might have looked like 150 years ago, when up to 70 boats a day worked this riverine route. If the Spry has magicked me back to Victorian times, however, I am about to rewind much further. Before the Industrial Revolution – and, in many cases, long afterwards – local people crossed, and fished from, the river by coracle. These little round boats, traditionally made for just one person from foraged wood and a cow or bull hide, were used for everything from poaching to ferrying goods during floods. In a nod to this more rural heritage, Shropshire Raft Tours plans to start hiring out coracles on the river from Easter, and my boys and I are in Ironbridge to test them out. Waiting for us on a little gravel beach by the town’s Museum of the Gorge is Nigel, our guide, and what looks like a giant bread basket. While Nigel holds the coracle, we all clamber in and perch on the wooden bench inside, admiring the boat’s finely woven bamboo form. “We were looking for something new to offer,” he says, hopping in and pushing off from the bank. “We wanted an experience that a whole family could do together and feel really stable.” On a sunny spring morning, months after the winter floods have subsided, it certainly feels stable. These larger coracles are rowed with a standard kayak or SUP stroke rather than the figure-of-eight movement traditional coraclers use, and as we take it in turns to have a go at paddling, it feels like handling a lightweight canoe. Or, when Nigel shows us how to spin, a slo-mo fairground teacup. Following his advice that the idea is to meander, not to race, we drift slowly downstream in a pool of refracting sunlight as though in a very chilled-out retelling of The Borrowers Afloat. Seating between two and four, these coracles are not the conventional type. Built by an expat Vietnamese boatbuilder Nigel met by chance while kayaking downstream in Bewdley, they’re made from bamboo, so they’re light but strong and, crucially, much less tippy than a traditional coracle. Hire will start and finish in Jackfield, a mile or so downstream, and while Nigel will be on hand to support first-timers, his customers will take the boats out on their own. Since we have Nigel with us, we make the most of it and paddle right under the town’s iconic bridge. Built in 1779, the world’s first iron bridge is a star player in the story of Britain’s Industrial Revolution. After Abraham Darby perfected iron-smelting with coke rather than charcoal in 1709, the area became a literal crucible of industry, producing cast iron, tiles, pipes, bricks and porcelain. Now it is a World Heritage Site, with museums centred on those industries and streets that whisper their legacies; look closely and you see pavements edged with iron and houses with blingy brickwork and tiling. In the 1930s James Hornell published a landmark study of coracles in which he reported seeing them hanging outside every cottage in Ironbridge. We don’t spot any from the water today, but we do pass ancient pubs where cargo deals were once done, old stones scarred by trow-luggers’ ropes and, fittingly, the old coracle shed of Eustace Rogers, a local man whose death in 2003 marked the end of a long line of Ironbridge coracle makers. The boys want to carry on paddling into the rapids ahead, but instead we leave the coracle, and Nigel, in Jackfield and walk up the riverbank to Coalbrookdale’s Green Wood Centre. This soulful spot, with a community garden and a cafe serving plates of shakshuka and halloumi salads, is where we’re to meet Marion Blockley of the national lottery-funded Ironbridge Coracle Heritage Project. Working with the Ironbridge Coracle Trust, the project aims to promote local coracling culture and heritage. As well as running coracle-making courses, organising an annual coracle regatta each August and hosting coracle try-outs during April-May’s Ironbridge Walking festival, the Trust’s recent work has focused on the New Coracle Shed. It was built in 2020 at the Green Wood Centre, when Rogers’ old coracle shed was deemed unsuitable for public access, and its size belies the breadth of its contents, which include treasured flotsam from Rogers’ shed as well as a community workshop space and a compelling, if tiny, museum. While the boys sit in one of the museum’s coracles, absorbed by local artist Cal Westbrook’s animated story, Colin in a Coracle, Marion tells me there’s been a renewed interest in the boats as people seek out slower pursuits in this digital age. “The craft of making, slowing down, sharing stories, being on the river – that’s what we’re all about,” she says. “We work with refugee groups, young carers, retirees. They paddle out and all the tension releases. It’s a bit like yoga. You find your sense of balance and then you relax. The sense of wellbeing is universal.” If you know what you’re looking for, Marion says, “you can tell a Welshpool coracle from a Shrewsbury, Ironbridge or Bewdley one. They all have their differences.” We peer at an archetypal Ironbridge one, made by Rogers and painted in glossy green and black, and I wonder what he’d think of our Vietnamese-style craft. I hope he’d be glad that, in 2022, these little boats – in whatever shape or form – are still scuttling back and forth across the river in Ironbridge. One-hour coracle hire costs from £30 for a two-seater with Shropshire Raft Tours. Entrance to the New Coracle Shed is free (ironbridgecoracles.org). An annual pass to Blists Hill costs £31 adult, £20 child, from £51 for a family, and gives unlimited entry to all the Ironbridge Gorge museums.

4/11/2022,"Why are benefits and pensions changing today? On 11 April all pensions and most state benefits will rise by 3.1%. The figure is based on the consumer prices index as calculated in September last year – just before prices for energy and other household costs started to rise. What is changing? The basic state pension will rise by £4.25 a week to £141.85 a week, while the full new state pension will go up £5.55 a week to £185.15. A single person aged 25 will see their universal credit allowance rise from £324.84 to £334.91 a month, or £4,019 a year. Child benefit rises 68p a week for the eldest child. All other benefits, including disability allowance, rise by the same percentage. The money is paid automatically and recipients do not need to act. A rise is good news, right? Unfortunately, bills are rising at a far faster rate, so most people receiving state benefits will have less money at the end of the month. Since September, Ofgem, the energy regulator, has twice increased the fuel cap – the maximum energy suppliers can charge for gas and electricity. Average dual fuel bills are now just under £2,000 a year – an increase of almost £700 for an average household. A pensioner on the full state pension will see their pension rise by £288 for the year. Even after the government’s £150 council tax rebate and the £200 loan is applied to their account, they will still be £350 a year worse off. And that is before further predicted energy hikes in October – to £2,600 – or any food price or other increases are factored in. Overall, inflation is predicted to rise to 8.4% or higher. Campaigners are already warning that some households are having to choose between heating and eating – a dilemma that a growing number will face over the next 12 months.",News/Business,UK benefits and pensions: what’s changing?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/11/uk-benefits-and-pensions-whats-changing
4/11/2022,"The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has been targeting Labor in the lead up to the 21 May election for a lack of policy detail, describing the opposition as a “completely blank page”. Labor, which ran an ambitious policy agenda at the 2019 election, has deliberately pared back its policy offering as part of a small-target strategy, but has announced several key policies that form the basis of its campaign. While Labor’s official website boasts 24 different policies, the party’s leader, Anthony Albanese’s main focus has been on the care sector, including childcare, aged care, and Medicare. He has also been talking up policies to promote manufacturing in Australia, Labor’s energy policy that will “end the climate wars” and more secure work as priorities. So what are Labor’s key policies? The centrepiece of Albanese’s budget in reply speech was a pledge to fix the crisis in the aged care sector, with a promise to spend an extra $2.5bn in the sector if elected. He said Labor would also fund a wage increase for aged care workers and require residential aged care facilities to have a registered nurse on site 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The final price tag for the wage claim is not yet known given it is still to be determined by the Fair Work Commission, however, the Health Services Union estimates the cost of the full 25% wage increase, along with a staff increase of about 60,000 people, would cost $4bn a year. Further policies for the sector include criminal penalties and jail time for providers who cover up abuse of residents, a new duty-of-care and compensation scheme for breaches, an aged care commissioner to deal with complaints, an as-yet-undetermined spending cap on administration fees for home care, greater transparency on spending, and better food for residents. The aged care sector has welcomed the commitments, which fulfil recommendations made by the Royal Commission into aged care, but some groups have asked for more detail. Cheaper childcare is another of Labor’s key campaign messages, with Albanese pledging to lift the maximum childcare subsidy rate to 90% for families for the first child in care, increase subsidies for single-child families earning less than $530,000, and extend the subsidy to outside school hours care. Labor says that most families will be better off under its reforms, which will cost $5.4bn starting from July 2023. According to the Grattan Institute, Labor’s policy costs twice as much as the Coalition’s recent childcare reforms, but will help more families and improve workforce participation. “It supports more families and would have much larger and more widespread economic benefits. It would bring down out-of-pocket costs and sharpen workforce incentives for a much wider group of families,” Owain Emslie from the Grattan Institute says. Labor has pledged to change the rules to allow regional and outer metro communities to recruit more doctors of their choosing, including overseas GPs, to help address a skills shortage that is worsening in regional Australia. While “making it easier to see a doctor” has been a key message from Albanese in recent months, the policy detail is yet to be announced, with this still expected during the election campaign. Promising to “end the climate wars” is another of Albanese’s election pledges, with the policy previously proving to be a vexed one for Labor, particularly in coal seats in New South Wales and Queensland. Labor has set an emissions reduction target of 43% by 2030, compared to the 26 to 28% promised by the Coalition, and will boost the share of renewables in the national electricity market to 82% if it forms government. Under its “powering Australia” plan, Labor will also upgrade the electricity grid to improve energy transmission, invest $3bn in green metal production and other carbon reducing measures and roll out solar banks and community batteries. Labor says it will fund up to 20,000 extra university places over 2022 and 2023, and provide access to 465,000 free Tafe places in nominated areas of skills shortages under a $1.2bn policy aimed at securing jobs. It says fee-free Tafe places in targeted areas will help rebuild the industries hit hardest by the pandemic, like hospitality and tourism, as well as meeting current and future needs in the care economy, including jobs in childcare, aged care, disability care, nursing and community services.

As part of its pledge for more secure jobs, Labor is also promising “same job, same pay” legal protection for contractors, more security for gig economy workers and to make wage theft illegal. Industry and employer groups have rejected much of what Labor is proposing, saying it will remove flexibility from the workforce and impose large costs. Albanese says he wants Australia to be a “country that makes things again” and has pledged to establish a $15bn national reconstruction fund if elected. The fund would be modelled on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, meaning the initial $15bn capital injection would stay off the government balance sheet to be provided through a combination of loans, equity, co-investment and guarantees. Recipients of the funding would need to return rates above the government borrowing rate, with the intention of funding projects in partnership with the private sector, including superannuation funds. Albanese says the fund would put Australia back on a path to “make cars, trains and ships” as part of a manufacturing revival. It has also pledged to establish a Future Made in Australia Office, backed up by laws, that would leverage the commonwealth’s multi-billion procurement budget to actively support local industry.",News/Australia news,Labor’s policies explained: where does the ALP stand on key election issues?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/11/labors-policies-explained-where-does-the-alp-stand-on-key-election-issues
4/11/2022,"Hello, I’m Virginia Harrison and these are today’s top stories: France faces a brutal two-week campaign over the country’s future, as the centrist incumbent, Emmanuel Macron, faces the far-right Marine Le Pen for the presidency. Macron topped Sunday’s first round of the presidential election with 27.6% of the vote, ahead of Le Pen’s 23%, according to initial projected results by Ipsos for France Télévisions. The president scored higher than his result in the first round five years ago, and clearly gained support in the final hours of the campaign after his harsh warnings to voters to hold back the far right and protect France’s place on the international diplomatic stage amid the war in Ukraine. But Le Pen’s score was also higher than five years ago. She had steadily gained support after campaigning hard on the cost-of-living crisis and inflation, which had become voters’ biggest concern. Macron told reporters: “When the far right, in all its forms, represents that much in France, you can’t consider things are going well, so you must go out and convince people with a lot of humility, and respect for those who weren’t on our side in this first round.” As our Paris correspondent Angelique Chrisafis writes, Le Pen’s success in reaching the runoff against Macron is not just about her long-running drive to sanitise her party’s image and move it away from the jackbooted and antisemitic imagery of the past. That Le Pen is now closer to power than ever before is in part the result of her own rethink of political strategy. Read Angelique’s analysis here and you can see how the two candidates stack up here. Austrian chancellor to meet Putin – Karl Nehammer is set to meet Vladimir Putin on Monday, the Russian president’s first face-to-face meeting with an EU leader since ordering the invasion of Ukraine, amid warnings of a fresh offensive and shelling in the east. Nehammer said the meeting would take place in Moscow and that Austria had a “clear position on the Russian war of aggression”, calling for humanitarian corridors, a ceasefire and full investigation of war crimes. Nehammer met Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Saturday – the same day as Boris Johnson, who promised to give Ukraine 120 armoured vehicles and anti-ship missile systems. On the ground, Russian forces pounded targets in eastern Ukraine with missiles and artillery on Sunday, and Ramzan Kadyrov, the powerful head of Russia’s republic of Chechnya, said there would be an offensive not only on the besieged southern port of Mariupol but also on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. The US has warned that the appointment of a new general in command of Russia’s military campaign is likely to usher in a fresh round of “crimes and brutality” against civilians. Alexander Dvornikov, 60, has a record of brutality in Syria. Our reporter Isobel Koshiw in Borodianka investigates how – despite almost no successful major prosecutions over the past 30 years - those building war crimes cases against Russia hope things will be different this time.

Sunak inquiry – Rishi Sunak has written to the prime minister to ask for an investigation into his own affairs after days of criticism over his wife’s “non dom” tax status and lack of transparency over their financial affairs. The chancellor wrote to Johnson asking him for a referral to Lord Geidt, the independent adviser, requesting a review of all his declarations since becoming a minister in 2018. Sunak said he was confident it would find “all relevant information was properly declared” on the advice of officials. It follows criticism that his entry on the list of ministers’ interests contains no mention of Akshata Murty’s £690m stake in Indian company Infosys, which has UK government contracts. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, has also written to Johnson and Geidt with a detailed series of questions, including whether Sunak had ever benefited from the use of tax havens. GP numbers drop – The number of GPs in England has fallen every year since the government first pledged to increase the family doctor workforce by 5,000, a minister has admitted. There were 29,364 full-time-equivalent GPs in post in September 2015, when the then health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, first promised to increase the total by 5,000 by 2020. However, by September 2020 the number of family doctors had dropped to 27,939, health minister Maria Caulfield disclosed in a parliamentary answer. Organisations representing GPs say heavy workloads, rising expectations among patients and excess bureaucracy are among the factors prompting experienced practitioners to quit. Separately, the country’s top emergency doctor has warned lives are at risk because 999 callers face unacceptable and appalling waits for ambulances in England. Graduates in demand – The UK has nearly a million graduate-level jobs without qualified staff filling them, according to a report for universities that predicts the labour market’s appetite for graduates will remain strong in the near future. Using data from official sources, the report published by Universities UK (UUK) found there were 15 million people with degrees or equivalent qualifications working in the UK at the end of 2020 – and nearly 16 million positions in managerial and professional occupations defined as graduate-level jobs. The UUK report is an attempt to rebut misconceptions about graduate employment, such as that undergraduate degrees can be poor value or that too many graduates are unable to find skilled employment.
