1/7/2022,"Fred Chin fumbles with the combination lock on an old metal gate, the bright turquoise marred by rust spots and grime. On the other side is a long dark corridor and rows of cells. It was here that Chin was detained, tried and sentenced to 12 years in an offshore jail by the totalitarian regime that ruled Taiwan for almost 40 years. “In one and a half years I left this room four times,” says the now 72-year-old, gesturing to the whitewashed walls. “Three times for court, and the last time when I was sent to Green Island. 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, the door was closed.”  Taiwan transitioned to a democracy in the late 1980s and is now one of Asia’s freest and most vibrant, but it is still reckoning with its history – still very much in living memory – and how to remember the man who oversaw it. Chin is a survivor of the White Terror period, the decades of martial law under Kuomintang (KMT) leader Chiang Kai-shek and his son. It began in 1947 with tens of thousands of civilians massacred for protesting against his rule, in what is now known as the 228 Incident. By the time it ended in 1987, it was estimated that as many as 140,000 people had been imprisoned and another 3,000-4,000 executed for actual or perceived opposition to the KMT. Chiang’s legacy is complicated. Some in Taiwan – even those who suffered directly – say he wasn’t all bad, and that successes like leading Taiwan to prosperity, and fighting the Japanese and the Chinese communists, must be weighed against his crimes. “A lot of Taiwanese people still pay their respect to this particular person,” says Chin. “We didn’t deny he’d done something wrong, and you can’t deny that he also has done something good.” In 2018 the DPP-led government established the transitional justice commission to investigate the decades of KMT acts against its people and work towards redress. A major focus of current discussions are thousands of Chiang statues across Taiwan, especially the island’s biggest at the generalissimo’s eponymous memorial park in the capital, Taipei. The 25-hectare park contains a huge open square, manicured gardens and two palatial performance halls, but its centrepiece is a towering monument housing a seated statue of Chiang more than six metres high, under guard. In September the commission formally proposed removing the giant statue, in a move “dismissing the legitimacy of the authoritarian rule and remembering historical lessons”. But it only fuelled division. The Kuomintang opposition – the party of Chiang which has taken steps to atone for its history – likened its potential destruction to the buddhas of Bamiyan, and the DPP to the Taliban. Some want the statue torn down, saying the reverential context is painful to the survivors and families of White Terror victims. Others, like Chin, say to destroy it is to forget history. “If you demolish everything, people can make no comparisons, people can’t know how or why the Taiwanese people hate him, why many people still adore him,” he says. Yang Zhenlong, chief executive of the 228 Memorial Foundation, established to support victims and families, suggests adding in statues of other Taiwanese leaders, to dilute the impact. His grandfather, father and uncle were killed during the White Terror and he says the park in its current form pains him. But he recognises that it is not straightforward. He says by western standards there is no doubt Chiang was the symbol of authoritarianism in Taiwan, even a murderer. “But people always fear to face the truth so they’ll find some excuse for themselves,” says Yang, while adding the debate “isn’t a bad thing” and is an opportunity to find common ground. One potential solution is a picturesque park surrounding Chiang’s mausoleum in Taoyuan, incongruously home to hundreds of stone and plaster Chiangs gradually relocated from across Taiwan. At the popular attraction, tourists amble around a lakeside path, lined with Chiang busts, and stop to examine groups of larger Chiangs, different colours and sizes but all smiling, positioned so they appear to be chatting with each other. Huang Kwei-bo, a professor of diplomacy at the National Chengchi University, says the statue should not be removed until Chiang’s legacy is reviewed “in a fair and balanced way”. Huang, who is a former deputy director of the modern KMT, says the DPP government’s transitional justice process is overly focused on Chiang for “political gain”. He questions why Chiang is such a big focus of the process compared with 50 years of brutal Japanese colonial rule prior to the KMT. The commission’s Yeh Hung-ling told Taiwan Plus in November that there were many ideas for what to do with the memorial hall but “the main point is that it needs to be transformed”. The government, which will make a decision on the commission’s recommendation in April, does not appear to be in a hurry. Culture minister Lee Yung-te told reporters last year that “what to do with the statues isn’t the top priority”. In the meantime, the reckoning continues. Chin now volunteers as a guide in the military court complex where he was held, converted in 1997 into the Jing-mei White Terror Memorial park and museum. “Our dredging of our stories, publicly … the main purpose is to let the younger generations learn from the history so they can know what they want from the future and what, if they neglect it, could happen to them,” he says.",News/World news,"‘Something wrong, something good’: Taiwan grapples with remembering Chiang Kai-shek",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/something-wrong-something-good-taiwan-grapples-with-remembering-chiang-kai-shek
1/7/2022,"The old joke about the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact was that it was the only military alliance to attack itself, after its tanks rolled into Prague in 1968 to crush a reform movement there. With the deployment of troops from the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) to Kazakhstan on Thursday, some heard “eerie echoes” of the so-called Prague spring of 1968, and the Soviet crushing of the Hungarian revolution in 1956.  Meant as a mutual defence pact, the CSTO has not made any joint deployments since its founding in 1999. Now it has been called upon to quell internal unrest in one of its member states. Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, claimed the revolt was inspired by foreign-backed “terrorists” to justify his appeal, but the call to the CSTO suggests he no longer felt he could trust his own forces. When Tokayev’s request came, the CSTO jumped into action in a matter of hours, and on Thursday morning Russian paratroopers were already arriving in Kazakhstan. The general secretary of the CSTO told RIA news agency that the overall peacekeeping force would number about 2,500 and could be strengthened if necessary. Some in Moscow praised the decision to intervene. Maxim Suchkov, the director of the Institute for International Studies at MGIMO, a leading Moscow university, dismissed comparisons with the Soviet-era Warsaw Pact interventions as “propaganda” and said a short mission could boost Russia’s standing in the region. The events in Kazakhstan represented a “crisis in which Moscow can be instrumental and helpful,” Suchkov wrote on Twitter. One definite similarity with the Warsaw Pact is that although the CSTO is an alliance, the decision to intervene was almost certainly taken in Moscow. It was cheered on by Belarus’s Alexander Lukashenko, who in 2020 was able to crush a huge revolution using his own domestic forces, but Vladimir Putin will have made the final call. Putin may be hoping that a swift mission will quickly restore order and leave Kazakhstan grateful and indebted to Moscow, but the operation comes with risks. The fact that the CSTO move is seen as a Russian intervention has caused dismay for many in Kazakhstan, where one of the former president Nursultan Nazarbayev’s main achievements was avoiding major conflict between the Kazakh majority and ethnic Russian minority in the country. Kazakhstan has proudly pursued a “multi-vector” foreign policy for years, and its close relations with Moscow were offset by good relations with western nations. As news broke on Wednesday of Tokayev’s request to the CSTO, the editor-in-chief of the state-run television station RT, Margarita Simonyan, set out a wishlist of demands. “We should definitely help, but we need to lay down some conditions as well,” she wrote on Twitter. These included making Russian a second state language in the country and recognising Crimea as part of Russia. It was a sign, perhaps, of how some in Moscow view the CSTO alliance. If Tokayev does succeed in crushing the protests with Moscow’s help, the Russians may expect favours in return.",News/World news,Putin taking a risk in Kazakhstan and may hope for reward,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/putin-taking-a-risk-in-kazakhstan-and-may-hope-for-reward
1/7/2022,"“Technically, I would guess that 80% of people are criminals according to that law since most of us have downloaded porn before, or if you’ve ever sent a dirty pic to your partner, that too is a crime.” One OnlyFans content creator, who goes by the online handle LucyToday, is among the many in Singapore who fear what the future holds after police decided to charge fellow creator and influencer Titus Low Kaide with transmitting what the police alleged were “obscene materials”. It is the first time an OnlyFans creator has faced prosecution in Singapore for sharing such content via the platform, according to local media.  It’s had a chilling effect on the OnlyFans community, says LucyToday, whose posts include nude images and those of a sexual nature. “Myself and other content creators are worried.” OnlyFans is a content subscription service that allows creators to post original material of any genre – including music, art, food as well as adult content – while fans pay a monthly subscription to access it. Launched in 2016, it has more than 150 million registered users, some of whom were part of an influx seen amid the pandemic as people looked for alternative ways to make money. Lucy was posting similar content on other sites free but joined OnlyFans in August last year to monetise it. She says she’ll continue to use the platform for now, hoping the government will change its “outdated and draconian laws”. Jada Saur, a content creator from Canada who previously lived in Singapore, fears the stance taken by authorities could cut off a significant income stream for many users. Saur joined OnlyFans at the start of the pandemic and says the income from posting nude photos and sexting will help put her through acting school. “It’s super scary because I think a lot of people are going to stop making OnlyFans content,” Saur says, adding that others might take steps to hide their identities on the site to avoid prosecution. Saur wonders if the reason Low, 22, was targeted when many others use the site is because of his creation of “guy-on-guy content”. Homosexuality remains illegal in Singapore. Low faced a district court on 30 December last year, charged under the country’s Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code, which makes it illegal to transmit any obscene materials by electronic means. He was accused of sharing explicit photos and videos as well as failing to comply with a police order not to access his account. If found guilty, Low could face prison time as well as multiple fines. In a video posted to his YouTube on Thursday, Low described his initial arrest, saying five police officers turned up at his house and confiscated his phone and all his online details. OnlyFans was his main source of income before the investigation, he says, and that it helped him escape a difficult background. Without that income, he says he’s in “a tight spot”. Low doesn’t know who filed the police report that led to the the charges but hopes the incident will “get people thinking about how inclusive our society is in 2022”. Some, including Low, have questioned the premise of the charges. “We don’t force you to watch our content,” Low says. “It’s not open for public consumption.” “I create specific content for specific adults. We are both willing buyer and seller,” he adds. Shailey Hingorani, head of research and advocacy at women’s rights and gender equality group Aware, agrees, given the images were being shared consensually. “An informed and enthusiastic exchange is taking place, and nobody is being hurt,” she says. During the next Penal Code review, Hingorani suggests “laws pertaining to sexual activity of any nature should be relooked at to keep up with society and technology, with the principle of consent as a basis to determine legality.” Until then, Project X, a nonprofit supporting sex workers in Singapore, says the move “has struck fear and panic in many adult content creators, who now worry that their livelihoods will be completely upended and their personal liberty threatened.”",News/World news,Fear and uploading in Singapore after OnlyFans creator charged over ‘obscene’ material,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/fear-and-uploading-in-singapore-after-onlyfans-creator-charged-over-obscene-material
1/7/2022,"Beijing has fined and issued a warning to 7-Eleven over its website listing Taiwan as a country and displaying maps it said contained erroneous borders for Xinjiang and Tibet. The Beijing municipal government fined the company 50,000 yuan ($7,842) for the “errors” including “wrongful act of assigning Taiwan province as an independent country”.  It said the 7-Eleven website also failed to use China’s names for some disputed islands in the South China Sea, including the Japanese-administered Senkakus which China calls the Diaoyu islands. The punishment was issued in December, but was first reported on Friday by Asia Nikkei. The convenience store chain is prolific across Asia, and the Beijing stores are owned by a domestic outpost of Seven-Eleven Japan, a subsidiary of Japanese firm 7 & i Holdings. The Chinese government claims Taiwan as a province and is hypersensitive to any act or reference which appears to support Taiwan’s position that it is a sovereign nation. High profile instances in recent years have sparked nationalistic backlash and boycotts, which have in turn prompted some profuse apologies. In May, John Cena, a co-star of blockbuster film Fast & Furious 9, uploaded a filmed apology given in Mandarin for any offence caused to Chinese people after he referred to Taiwan as a country while promoting the film. According to Nikkei Asia, Seven & i Holdings acknowledged the complaint and said it would “do our best to prevent a recurrence”.
