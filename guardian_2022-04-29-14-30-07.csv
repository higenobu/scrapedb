4/29/2022,"A soldier witness called by Ben Roberts-Smith in his defamation trial has told the court he is separately being investigated for an alleged war crime committed at Darwan, during the same raid on which Roberts-Smith is accused of kicking a handcuffed prisoner off a cliff. Person 35 spent his third day in the witness box on Friday, and was cross-examined over the death of a man called Haji Nazar Gul, during an Australian SAS raid on the village of Darwan, in Afghanistan’s Uruzgan province, on 11 September 2012. He said the allegation he murdered Gul was false – “that report is a lie” he told the court – saying Gul was an armed insurgent he lawfully killed. But Person 35 said he was aware the allegation Gul was murdered was being investigated by the Office of the Special Investigator, set up by the government to investigate allegations of possible war crimes committed by Australian special forces in Afghanistan. He said he understood the allegation being investigated by the OSI related to him, and his alleged killing of Gul. “I am aware that that is being investigated,” he told the court. “I’ve had a false allegation made against me.” Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges were defamatory and portrayed him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. The federal court heard during cross-examination on Friday that two Afghan men were allegedly killed, by two Australian soldiers, in a building in Darwan village marked by the Australian troops as Compound 31. The newspapers in their defence allege that on the same mission to Darwan, Roberts-Smith murdered a man called Ali Jan who had been taken prisoner by Australian troops. Roberts-Smith is alleged to have walked Ali Jan, bound in handcuffs and blindfolded, to the edge of a cliff, before kicking him in the chest, causing him to fall more than 10 metres into a dry riverbed. Having walked down a footpad to the riverbed, it is alleged Roberts-Smith ordered Ali Jan shot dead before his body was dragged to a cornfield. Australian soldier witnesses have given evidence for the newspapers’ defence that they saw Ali Jan being kicked from the cliff, and three Afghan nationals have also testified for the newspapers over his death. Roberts-Smith has denied the allegation, telling the court in his evidence the man purported to be Ali Jan was a “spotter” discovered hiding in a cornfield and carrying a radio, who refused an order to stop. He was a legitimate target, lawfully killed in accordance with the laws of war. Roberts-Smith has maintained he could not have killed the man as alleged because there was no cliff from which to kick him. “There was no cliff … there was no kick,” he told the court. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While the death of Ali Jan has been the subject of extensive evidence in this trial, the allegation over the death of Haji Nazar Gul, in a separate compound in Darwan on the same day, has not previously been raised in evidence, and is not part of the defamation trial. During cross-examination of Person 35 by lawyers for the newspapers on Friday, an ABC article entitled Death in Darwan was entered into evidence. The article quoted Darwan villagers who said two men, one of whom was Gul, were taken into an almond storage room by Australian soldiers and shot dead. Person 35 said the accounts were “lies”. He confirmed before the court he and another SAS soldier shot the two men, but said the killing was lawful. “Those two insurgents we engaged in that compound were legally engaged … they were armed.” Justice Anthony Besanko mentioned to Person 35 the immunity regime available to witnesses, but Person 35 said he did not need an immunity certificate to talk about the incident because, he said, he had done nothing wrong. Person 35 was also questioned over his legal representation. He told the court he understood Kerry Stokes, chairman of the Seven Network, and Roberts-Smith’s employer, was paying his legal fees. The fees were actually being paid by Seven, a public company, until the arrangement was revealed in court this week, when Seven asked Stokes’s private company, ACE, to assume the debt. Person 35 said he was unaware of the arrangement: “My understanding was Mr Kerry Stokes was paying for it.” Person 35 told the court he approached Roberts-Smith seeking legal representation because he did not trust the free lawyers offered to him by the defence force for his interview with the inspector general of the defence force. Nicholas Owens SC, acting for the newspapers, put it to Person 35, he was a partisan witness, who believed his legal fees continuing to be met was contingent on him “being on ‘Team Roberts-Smith’” and giving evidence in support of Roberts-Smith. “That’s incorrect, your honour.” Owens put it to Person 35 he was “prepared to lie to the court” to support his friend Roberts-Smith. “That’s incorrect … I am here to tell the truth.” Roberts-Smith’s first soldier witness, known before court as Person 5, also confirmed during his cross-examination that he was being investigated over the potential commission of war crimes. Person 5 agreed under cross-examination that a total of five murder allegations had been made against the patrol he served on with Roberts-Smith: including two alleged incidents at Whiskey 108 which form part of the newspapers’ defence in this case. The other three incidents are alleged to have occurred in 2010 at a compound known as Whiskey 591. Person 5 told the court he was interviewed by the inspector general of the ADF in 2018 over allegations of war crimes. Person 35 remains in the witness box.

4/29/2022,"The prime minister of Solomon Islands has accused the Australian government of hypocrisy over his country’s security deal with China, saying the Aukus pact was far from transparent but he “did not become theatrical and hysterical”. Manasseh Sogavare said Solomon Islands and other countries in the region “should have been consulted to ensure that this Aukus treaty is transparent since it will affect the Pacific family by allowing nuclear submarines in Pacific waters”. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, hit back on Friday afternoon, suggesting that Sogavare had changed his view based on “other influences” and that there was a “remarkable similarity between those statements and those of the Chinese government”. China announced last week that it had signed a security agreement with Solomon Islands, although the final terms of that deal are not yet public. Australia, the UK and the US announced in mid-September they would deepen trilateral security cooperation through Aukus and launched a project to find the best way for Australia to acquire at least eight nuclear-propelled submarines. The Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, used a speech on Thursday to criticise the secrecy surrounding the Solomons security agreement while insisting “no document signed and kept away from public view” would change Australia’s commitment to answering Pacific island countries’ needs. In an at-times defensive address to parliament in Honiara on Friday, Sogavare said the “western media” had accused Solomon Islands and China of showing a lack of transparency about the agreement. But Sogavare said he had first “learned of the Aukus treaty in the media”. “One would expect that as a member of the Pacific family, Solomon Islands and members of the Pacific should have been consulted to ensure that this Aukus treaty is transparent, since it will affect the Pacific family by allowing nuclear submarines in Pacific waters,” Sogavare said. “Oh, but I realise … that Australia is a sovereign country, and that it can enter into any treaty that it wants to, transparently or not – which is exactly what they did with [the] Aukus treaty.” Sogavare added: “When Australia signed up to Aukus we did not become theatrical and hysterical on the implications this would have for us. We respected Australia’s decision. And I’m glad to say that Australia, United States of Australia and Japan respected our sovereignty to enter into this security agreement with China as well, based on trust and mutual respect.” Morrison said had spoken with Sogavare the day after the Aukus announcement in September 2021, as part of a round of calls with many leaders briefing them on what had been negotiated in a “highly secure” environment. Morrison said Australia had moved quickly to reassure the Pacific about Australia’s ongoing commitment to meet its nuclear non-proliferation obligations. “I did have that conversation with the prime minister [Sogavare] the day following the announcement, and no issues were raised at that time in that discussion,” Morrison told reporters during an election campaign stop in Tasmania. “But obviously, as time goes on and new relationships are entered into, there’s obviously been some clearly other influences in the perspective taken by the Solomon Islands prime minister. Now, I understand that.” When a journalist asked whether Morrison was saying Sogavare was parroting China’s rhetoric, the Australian prime minister replied: “There’s a remarkable similarity between those statements and those of the Chinese government.” China has been particularly critical of the Aukus agreement, seeing it as part of US efforts to contain it, and has emphasised nuclear non-proliferation risks. A Chinese foreign ministry official, Wang Wenbin, told reporters on Wednesday that the US and Australia were guilty of “pure double standards”. “The US shows no openness and transparency when it conducted nuclear tests and dumped nuclear wastes in the South Pacific region and when Aukus opened the Pandora’s box of nuclear proliferation in the Asia Pacific region,” Wang said. Sogavare reiterated on Friday that Solomon Islands would not allow a Chinese military base in the country. He said he agreed with other leaders, including Morrison, that such a military base would not be in the interest of Solomon islands or the region. But Sogavare said he found it “very, very offensive” that Canberra had flatly denied it refused to allow Australian police and defence force personnel to protect Chinese-built infrastructure and the Chinese embassy during last year’s riots in Honiara. He said Solomon Islands was left “with no option but to enter into security agreement with our other bilateral partners to plug the gaps that exist in our security agreement with Australia”. “Solomon Islands is grateful for the security agreement that it has with Australia,” Sogavare said. “However, the riots in 2006 and most recently the November riots have shown that even with Australia’s support we could not prevent half of Honiara from being razed to the ground.” Sogavare said a stable Solomon Islands would lead to a stable Pacific and his country did not “subscribe to the view that only a partner or partners of the same ideology is able to do that”. On Thursday, a key adviser to the premier of the most populous province in Solomon Islands expressed concern that the deal could enable Sogavare to use Chinese armed police and military personnel to quash democratic dissent and hold power for years to come.",News/World news,Solomon Islands PM suggests Australia’s reaction to China security deal is hysterical and hypocritical,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/29/solomon-islands-pm-suggests-australias-reaction-to-china-security-deal-is-hysterical-and-hypocritical

4/29/2022,"Prices were rising before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has further disrupted energy markets and food exports, forcing developing countries to pay more to import staples at a time when they are already struggling with increased debts taken on to pay for pandemic responses. While panic over inflation has led news agendas all over the world, the IMF’s World Economic Outlook released this week estimated it would reach 8.7% in developing economies compared with 5.7% in rich countries. Experts fear millions more will be driven into poverty and that transport and food networks will be affected. Humanitarian efforts for refugees and populations already facing hunger crises could also struggle to cope with increased prices, at a time when many are already coping with reduced aid funding. “The rising cost of getting aid into areas like north-west Syria, which is hugely dependent on humanitarian aid, means that it’s the people who need help most who are suffering,” said Jessica Adams, head of communications at Syria Relief. “Our costs in meeting the needs have gone up – petrol for trucking water into camps costs more, building homes for displaced Syrians in tents costs more as building materials have gone up. This is against a backdrop where donations to Syria are reducing – so in a conflict like Syria … living has become unaffordable.” The effects of the Ukraine war on oil, and the energy sector as a whole, are being monitored by experts but prices have fluctuated wildly since Russia’s invasion and there is concern about how much oil is being refined and exported as the products ordinary people need. Rising oil prices are being felt on the forecourts, with petrol up 63% in Sudan, 50% in Sierra Leone and 42% in Ghana compared with 9% in Britain. “You cannot isolate oil from the other markets – gas prices are higher, coal prices are higher, food prices are higher and you have supply-chain bottlenecks. There are a lot of headwinds that are affecting economics all over the world,” said Bassam Fattouh, director of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. “If you look at it from a consumer’s point of view, they are being hit left and right all over the world.” Oxfam has estimated that a quarter of a billion people face poverty this year because of rising food and fuel prices, calling it “the most profound collapse of humanity into extreme poverty and suffering in memory”. The UN’s agencies raised concerns about how rising food and fuel costs will affect their operations, predicting a $136m rise in operational costs in West Africa. In east Africa it has warned of refugee families getting into debt and selling off their belongings because they fear ration cuts. The UN warned last week of developing countries becoming “collateral damage” of the Ukraine war. “The developing countries are facing a perfect storm of soaring food and fuel prices with already limited fiscal space and high debt ratios. We need urgent measures to prevent great human suffering and the world tipping into an era of social and political unrest,” said Rebeca Grynspan, secretary general of the UN conference on trade and development (Unctad). The IMF said the war was derailing post-pandemic economic recovery and estimated global growth would slow from 6.1% last year to 3.6% in 2022. It also said the pandemic had increased debt because of response spending, making vulnerable countries reliant on oil and food imports. In Sri Lanka, the lack of foreign currency reserves has sparked a movement to bring down the government, which has struggled to import food, medicine and fuel, leading to blackouts and farmers struggling to transport crops. In Peru there have been anti-government protests over fuel and fertiliser prices, while Egypt has tried to avert similar anger with price controls, punishing non-compliant bakeries and retailers with closure. Living costs helped fuel the anti-government demonstrations that brought down Sudanese dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019 and similar protests have emerged against the military rulers who took control in a coup last October. Kholood Khair, of Sudanese thinktank Insight Strategy Partners, said the rise in food and fuel prices is adding to the grievances being voiced by protesters. “Gas prices have been rising steadily in the past few months at the same time as the government has been struggling to retain hard currency in the central bank to buy more … the government has very acute supply problems,” said Khair, who added that many of the fuel subsidies have been removed since Bashir’s exit. “If the Gulf doesn’t come with financial support and in-kind support with fuel, then the generals in Khartoum will find themselves in an ever more precarious position.”",News/Global development,Inflation bites hardest in developing world as Ukraine war raises prices,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/29/inflation-bites-hardest-in-developing-world-as-ukraine-war-raises-prices
4/29/2022,"The leader of a headteachers’ union will claim the government is undermining the teaching of decency and honesty in schools, after “misleading” the country over Partygate and showing a lack of compassion towards refugees. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), will accuse the government of an “absolute failure of political leadership”, which is leading to a breakdown in trust among young people. In a damning speech to the NAHT’s annual conference on Friday, Whiteman will say that the prime minister’s behaviour over Partygate is “unforgivable”, and that the government’s failings are making it harder for schools to produce well-rounded young people who are ready to fulfil their role in society. “The basics taught in school are not how to write and how to count,” Whiteman will tell delegates. “The first things are self-regulation, good behaviour, decency, honesty and integrity. Things that are hard to observe in the UK government right now.“I am not that angry that we all obeyed the rules at the most desperate of times while our leaders partied,” he will tell NAHT members, who are gathering in Telford this weekend. “In the grand scheme of things, the offence of having a glass of wine and a slice of cake is minor. “But for the prime minister of the country to mislead us about it, repeatedly, is unforgivable, and clearly in breach of the standards of our democratic institutions,” Whiteman will say. “If we cannot trust our leaders to tell the truth about cake, how can we trust that we will be told the truth about war? How can we trust that we will be told the truth about refugees, how can we trust that we will be told the truth about the economy, the progress of the pandemic … or the government’s ambitions for education? “It matters because young people can see this playing out before their very eyes. And schools’ efforts to make sure young people understand the basics of self-regulation, good behaviour, decency, honesty and integrity become so much more difficult against that backdrop.” Whiteman is also expected to attack the government’s record on refugees and to reject recent ministerial interference over political impartiality and how schools discuss these issues with their pupils. “Like the rest of us, young people see on the television every day the appalling scenes from Ukraine. And before that, the difficult scenes from Afghanistan and the difficult scenes from Syria. “They see refugees, desperate humans, arriving on our shores in rubber boats from France. And they also see the complete lack of compassion, the complete lack of humanity demonstrated by our government in the way we deal with these issues. Young people are not stupid.” A government spokesperson said: “Since the onset of the Covid pandemic we have supported schools with almost £5bn for education recovery. Alongside this we are delivering on our manifesto commitment to raise teachers starting salaries to £30,000.”",News/Politics,"Partygate undermines teaching of honesty and decency, says union chief",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/29/partygate-undermines-teaching-of-honesty-and-decency-says-union-chief
4/29/2022,"Amtrak trains leave New York from the Moynihan Train Hall, a vast Beaux Arts building that used to house the city’s main post office. Like its equivalents in London – Paddington or St Pancras – it is designed to give travellers a sense of soaring possibility, the first stage in a journey that might take them anywhere. Last week, over Easter, my two seven-year-olds and I boarded a train at Moynihan for the 19-hour journey to Chicago. We could barely have been more excited if we’d been setting out in covered wagons. The romance of train travel is an anachronism that climate activists are keen to revive, but it’s a tough sell. In the US, the national train network is slow, patchy and underfunded. Amtrak teeters, apparently indefinitely, on the brink of bankruptcy, requiring multiple government subsidies – the latest, in November last year, totalled $66bn. In Britain, the issue is cost, too, although it’s one largely borne by the consumer. Andy Burnham’s recent Twitter fury about the cost of rail fares between London and Manchester – £369 for a last-minute return, which, as the mayor of Manchester pointed out, might buy you a return flight to Brazil – highlighted an exorbitant system so riven with fare rules as to make it unusable beyond the narrowest of circumstances. All of which is a shame, given the potential of travelling by rail. It is vastly safer than driving. You can get stuff done on the way. If you can bear to look up from your phone for a moment, it can induce a dreamlike state that a veteran Amtrak steward once described to me as the “zen of train travel”. Commuter rail hell is one thing, but for journeys of two or more hours, there should be a level of comfort, cost and availability on trains that cars can’t begin to compete with. Outside of the north-east corridor, I hadn’t been on a long Amtrak journey for almost 18 years. A lifetime ago, I took the sleeper up the west coast from LA to Seattle, via Oregon. It was a tourist route, and the train was full of people with time on their hands: retirees and foreign visitors, plus people with complicated phobias around flying. Even then, the service felt like a relic, but in a good way: an antiquated experience with a public service vibe. When Amtrak isn’t shedding workers to save costs, it is known to retain stewards for extraordinarily long periods of service and, on those epic routes, there was a sense of encountering characters in Amtrak livery who sprang from American folk history. Some things have changed since then. Covid finished off the old-fashioned dining car where food was made to order, to be replaced with reheated airline trays. On the other hand, the Amtrak wifi has improved immeasurably. The coffee isn’t bad. In our tiny cabin with bunk beds, the toilet doubled as a footstool to the top bunk and was exactly at window height. This meant that when the train ran alongside the highway, you could potentially be sitting on the loo while cars drove 20ft away from you peering in, a fact that kept us entertained through most of Ohio. And although everyone felt vaguely sick from the motion at night, when we woke up in Indiana it was to glance out of the window at a large contingent of Mennonites in bonnets, disembarking in a town called Elkhart. You don’t get that kind of charm with air travel. It was expensive. If I’d been organised, I could have shaved a couple of hundred dollars off the price by booking earlier, but it would still have cost more than travelling by plane. For the three of us occupying a single cabin, I was out $900 one way; a return air fare to Chicago for three people that week was nearer $600. So it’s luxury travel, something only to be contemplated very occasionally as a treat, not a default. Which is a shame. Trains follow along the back roads, cleaving close to small towns and through endless rolling scenery. We passed alongside the rusting skeletons of abandoned industries and the tiny farming communities around them. We were forced, for 20 hours, to slow down, exhale and look outside our own bubbles, with a restored sense of scale at the vastness of the country, and a feeling one very rarely encounters: wonder.

4/29/2022,"Adense, early morning fog blanketed the moorland valley. From my garden I could just make out submerged shapes of scattered stone buildings, soft silhouettes of trees skirting the hillside, the pale disc of the rising sun like a pill dissolving in the mist. I stood and waited, listening hard for the sound that had brought me outside. Then it came again, cutting through the damp air, two notes repeated with the rhythm of a heartbeat: Cuck-oo. Cuck-oo. Cuck-oo. It must have arrived in the night. Now at dawn it proclaimed its arrival on Dartmoor with such stridency it all but silenced the chorus of smaller birds. I hoped that other early risers in the village were listening in – it felt too important to miss. Its clear and simple song sounded as if it might carry for miles. I liked to imagine it drifting far and wide across the county, the country, that I might share such a precious sign of spring. If I could, I would have shaken the population awake and urged everyone to cock an ear in this direction: “Listen – can you hear it? Can you hear it?” We are fortunate to get cuckoos every year along this western fringe of Dartmoor, but as numbers dwindle nationally it is a relief when they return. Fewer and fewer people will get to welcome back this annual visitor. And that is particularly sad for such an eccentric spring celebrity, with its comical clock connections and dump-and-run attitude to parenting. The cuckoo is also one of a handful of bird species that even non-experts can recognise by song alone – a connection with nature that is gradually being lost. I got into my car and drove the short distance to the moor. Windows wound down, stopping every so often, I followed its voice in the mist. There was little sense in getting out and trying to close the gap on foot, given the lack of visibility. It hardly mattered. It is the sound, rather than sight, of a cuckoo which is so distinctive. I sat in a layby with the engine off, savouring the notes until the bird moved on unseen. Gradually its call grew fainter – a fading pulse in the fog.

4/29/2022,"Golf history will be made when players tee off on the opening hole of this year’s Australian Open with the men’s and women’s events to be played at the same time and at the same venue. They will be the first recognised national Opens to feature the women’s and men’s tournaments side by side, with an equal share of the minimum $3.4m prizemoney on offer to fields comprising 144 men and 144 women. Victoria Golf Club will be the primary host venue across all four days of the tournament running from 1 to 4 December, with Kingston Heath Golf Club hosting on the first two days. Five-time women’s Australian Open winner Karrie Webb, who will come out of semi-retirement to chase another title, said the alignment of the two tournaments represented a big step forward in the pursuit of gender equality in golf. “I love this concept, the game is cooperating and bringing down barriers and that needs to happen,” she said. “It’s just awesome for me to see women on the same stage with the same billing, as they should be. We’ve seen it with other events, the public love it and they want it that way.” Webb was the last local woman to win the Open in 2014 at Victoria, but she has also tasted success at Kingston with victory there in 2008. “At this stage I plan to dust off the clubs – I wouldn’t miss an opportunity to play both of these courses,” Webb said on Friday. “I’ve played two Australian Opens, one at Vic and one at Kingston Heath, and fared pretty well at both, definitely would love to tee it up. “I did play a tournament in Florida in January and plan to play a couple in the summer over in the States, so my form won’t be too far away. Melbourne golf courses are a challenge at the best of times, so we’ll see how it goes.” The men’s event will headline the PGA Tour of Australasia, while the women’s event will be sanctioned by the WPGA Tour of Australasia. The men’s event will also be sanctioned on the DP World Tour. The Golf Australia CEO, James Sutherland, said the new format was a significant strategic move and that the dual tournaments were a “coup” for Australian golf. “We strongly believe in this concept,” he said. “We’ve seen it at the Australian Open tennis for years, and it just makes sense that fans can see their idols, whether they be men or women, all in the one place. “The move aligns with our new national strategy and our ambitions to appeal to new audiences.

4/29/2022,"A candidate for Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party has been referred to the Australian Federal Police after allegedly nominating to run in two different seats on opposite sides of the country. The Australian Electoral Commission revealed that it had referred Malcolm Heffernan to the AFP after discovering he had nominated to stand in the New South Wales seat of Banks and the Western Australian seat of Brand. The nominations were for two separate parties. Heffernan was selected as the One Nation candidate in Banks, but was standing for the little-known Australian Federation party in WA. In a statement the AEC said that each of Heffernan’s nomination forms contained a signed declaration that he “did not intend to be a candidate in any other election held the same day”. The forms allegedly had differences in the listed information, “including a different date of birth, and a different expression of the candidate’s name,” the AEC said. One Nation and Malcolm Heffernan have been contacted for comment. It marks the second time during this election that the AEC has referred a candidate to the federal police. Last week the commission referred former One Nation senator Rodney Culleton to the AFP after he nominated to run for the “Great Australia party” in the WA Senate. The AEC said it had referred Culleton’s case alleging he declared he was not an undischarged bankrupt or insolvent. But the commission said Culleton was listed as an ‘undischarged bankrupt’ on the National Personal Insolvency Index. “The AEC has referred Mr Culleton’s candidate nomination form to the Australian Federal Police to ascertain if a false declaration has been made,” the commission said. “The outcome of the AFP’s examination of this matter will be a matter for the AFP to advise in due course. “If the AEC is presented with compelling evidence that other candidates in the 2022 federal election may have also signed a false declaration, we will consider whether similar referrals to the AFP are warranted.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning After the AEC referred his case, Culleton said he had “never been a bankrupt at law”. “This matter was referred by the AEC in 2019 and was dismissed through lack of evidence … I am not in contravention [of section] 44 [of the] Constitution … and [am] simply going back to address unfinished business to overcome the injustice that has occurred,” he said. Culleton was declared bankrupt in 2016, and was dismissed from the Senate. He appealed to the WA supreme court, but the conviction was upheld.",News/Australia news,One Nation candidate accused of running for two parties on opposite sides of country,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/29/one-nation-candidate-malcolm-heffernan-accused-of-running-for-two-parties-nsw-seat-banks-wa-brand
4/29/2022,"A majority of the New Zealand supreme court recently endorsed its government’s view that China can be trusted to respect the human rights of the criminally accused and give them a fair trial. While this ruling involved some rather technical matters of administrative law, it cannot be divorced from the larger geopolitical picture. Current relations between China and liberal democracies in the Australasian region are strained. The recent China-Solomon Islands security deal has exacerbated concerns about increased regional militarisation. There have been alleged attempts by China to exert influence over the internal politics of both Australia and New Zealand. And there are widespread concerns about China’s refusal to respect basic human rights, particularly in Xinjiang province. Nevertheless, China remains the largest trading partner of both Australia and New Zealand – albeit a partner that has demonstrated a preparedness to use trade as a diplomatic lever. The supreme court’s decision involved Kyung Yup Kim, a South Korean national and New Zealand resident whom China accuses of murdering a young woman, Peiyun Chen, in Shanghai in 2009. He denies the charge. China has been seeking since 2011 to extradite Kim in order to try him for the alleged offence. However, with no extradition treaty between China and New Zealand, the decision requires approval by New Zealand’s minister of justice. Before the minister can do so, they must be satisfied of a number of things. Most importantly, that Kim will not be subject to torture and that he can receive a fair trial in China. In 2016, then-minister of justice Amy Adams accepted promises from China relating to Kim’s future treatment and agreed to his extradition. Kim asked the courts to review this decision, with his case finally arriving in the supreme court last year. The court unanimously agreed that Kim could be extradited, provided China gave appropriate assurances that he would not be tortured and would receive a fair trial. In declining to adopt a total bar against extradition, the court assumed the possibility that China could be trusted to keep its word on matters relating to fundamental human rights. Then, in early April of this year, the court held by a three-two majority that the minister of justice reasonably could accept a series of assurances from China regarding Kim’s future treatment. Despite evidence of China’s propensity to use torture as a part of its investigative practices and general lack of an independent judiciary, the court agreed the minister could trust China to respect Kim’s rights. The government’s preparedness to accept such assurances, and the court’s willingness to endorse that acceptance, represents more of a politically convenient “noble lie” than a reflection of current evidence. Judicial concern to leave room for a reasonable ministerial decision that China can be relied on to stick to its word meant that the majority downplayed how China has actually behaved in practice. Furthermore, the current structure of New Zealand’s extradition laws means the court’s approach of maintaining final ministerial discretion allows the ultimate question of Kim’s fate to be answered using a process that is worryingly tainted by geopolitical considerations. If nothing else, Kim’s case demonstrates why the underlying statutory framework needs amending in line with the Law Commission’s recommendations. Similar concerns about the court’s decision have been voiced here in New Zealand and around the world. Twenty-two members of the inter-parliamentary alliance on China (Ipac), a cross-party international group of MPs, have written to the current minister of justice expressing their disquiet at the precedent Kim’s case may set. Whether Kim will now be surrendered to China for extradition remains unclear. The minister of justice has agreed that this will not happen before the end of this month, while Kim’s lawyers are asking the UN’s human rights committee to consider his case. Regardless of Kim’s fate, the supreme court’s endorsement of the reliability of diplomatic promises from China on fair-trial issues is a significant and worrying development. There are grave and well-documented problems with China’s criminal justice system, including ongoing occurrences of torture, and breaches of minimum fair-trial standards. New Zealand has a legal and moral obligation to be credibly assured that the fundamental human rights of individuals surrendered for extradition will not be breached. As the ongoing Kim saga shows, obtaining such assurance is an inherently politicised inquiry. As the extradition framework currently stands, New Zealand’s human rights obligations may be overlooked in pursuit of other state interests.

4/29/2022,"This week, the Fair Work Commission commenced landmark hearings into whether Australia’s aged care workforce should receive a 25% pay rise, to bring their pay into parity with disability and hospital workers. Undoubtedly, these hearings will tell us what we already know: the aged care workforce is overwhelmingly female, underpaid and undervalued. Its workers are often asked to work in facilities with unsafe levels of staffing that contribute to neglect and care failures. Rates of burnout are high, with a looming exodus of more workers; a recent survey revealed that one in five workers are contemplating leaving aged care within the next year. Confronted about his perceived failure to address longstanding workforce issues in the sector during the leaders’ debate last week, the prime minister made a jaw-dropping statement that evoked his infamous phrase about not holding hoses in its sheer disavowal of authority. “We can’t just make nurses fall out of the sky,” Morrison said, implying that the federal government is incapable of exerting any influence over the recruitment or retention of nurses, or improved working conditions in aged care. This is patently untrue. More than 20 inquiries into the aged care sector over the past decade have handed down a slew of recommendations about how to address aged care workforce issues, including pay rises, staffing minimums, training opportunities, and more nurses. There’s no lack of effective solutions to the problems in aged care – only a lack of political will to enact them. The royal commission offered several key recommendations to address working conditions in aged care, including mandating the presence of a registered nurse on-site at all times in aged care facilities, and the introduction of minimum staffing minutes per resident per day. The importance of 24/7 RNs in aged care facilities is irrefutable: RNs are highly trained, and because they can dispense pain medication, their presence reduces hospital transfers and enhances the quality of palliative care. Yet in its formal response to the royal commission, the Morrison government postponed the implementation of minimum staffing minutes by over a year, and has only committed to funding RNs for 16 hours per day from October 2023. In the face of Labor’s commitment to fund 24/7 RNs, the government has mounted the fatalistic argument that there aren’t enough nurses in the workforce, and that regional aged care facilities may have to close if such a standard were introduced due to a dearth of staff. While it’s true that there aren’t presently enough nurses in the aged care system – the Department of Health projects that an additional 14,000 nurses will be required to meet the requirement of RNs 16 hours a day, and an additional 2,500 nurses to enable 24/7 RNs – the real question is why the Morrison government has failed to recruit the workforce it has long known would be needed, and why it has allowed so many regional aged care facilities to close under its watch. Rather than offering any meaningful solutions to these workforce issues, the Morrison government and its ministers seem intent on relishing the difficult task they will hand Labor if it wins government. Bafflingly, the health and aged care minister, Greg Hunt, has sought to criticise Labor for supposedly backflipping over the fact that they may need to recruit overseas nurses to fulfil its promise of 24/7 nursing, saying that Labor “doesn’t have the nurses or doctors for [Albanese’s] election promises … they will have to import them after his Shadow Minister ruled that out only days ago”, and describing Labor’s commitment to mandating 24/7 RNs by 2023 as posing “profound risks to care and rural services”. Coming from a minister who, as recently as October last year, was championing his own initiative to recruit 2,000 overseas doctors and nurses to help Australia cope with the Delta wave, the critique is as hypocritical as it is misguided. The federal government’s Aged Care Workforce Action Plan 2022-2025 states it will create 33,800 new vocational and educational training places and 15,000 jobtrainer places, among a range of initiatives aimed at attracting workers to the sector. However, even if all these training places were filled, there will be a shortfall of 19,200 workers across that four year period from the projected 17,000 additional workers Ceda modelling shows will need to enter aged care every year over the next decade to deliver safe standards of care. Hunt’s comments belie his ignorance of an obvious truth: our aged care system would collapse without overseas nurses and carers, who make up a significant and ever-increasing proportion of the workforce. The federal government’s own Aged Care Workforce Action Plan concedes as much, noting that “migration pathways are also important in the supply of aged care workers.” In 2011, 31% of aged care workers were born overseas; by 2016, this proportion had jumped to 37%. It’s now estimated that 40% of new aged care workers entering the workforce are migrants. Rather than crowing about Labor’s reliance on migrant workers, Hunt would be better to ask himself why such a significant proportion of our existing aged care workforce comes from overseas, and why these mostly female workers are so overworked and underpaid. It’s critically important that Australia develops a sustainable aged care workforce and that more local nurses and carers are incentivised to enter the sector, but this outcome won’t be achieved by attacking Labor for relying on migrant workers who play such an important role within it today and will make their contributions in the future. It will only be achieved by meaningful reforms which address the underlying challenges in recruiting and retaining aged care workers.
