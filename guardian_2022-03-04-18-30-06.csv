3/4/2022,"They say never go back. But then “they” never had to cope with derisive reviews, tumbling box office receipts and the highly public fall from grace of an A-list star. In the ranks of movies based on the works of JK Rowling, Fantastic Beasts 2: The Crimes of Grindelwald, released in 2018, was the Wizarding World equivalent of that time Neville Longbottom accidentally transplanted his own ears on to a cactus; an episode so muddled and painful that the average Hogwarts student would need a magic spell just to understand what the hell was supposed to be going on and why any of us should care. And so the saga’s next instalment, The Secrets of Dumbledore, is probably best off harking back to the good old days, when Harry, Ron and Hermione only had to worry about Voldemort’s next appearance rather than the potential cancellation of an entire movie series. Duly, the new trailer for the film arrived this week, and we were treated to our first look at the famous wizarding school since 2011’s Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2. There’s even a clip of Michael Gambon as Professor Albus Dumbledore, just to remind everyone that this was a very successful movie series once. The problem is, even if Hogwarts is back in the picture, we all know this isn’t going to be a movie about quidditch, inter-house rivalries and the difficulties of navigating Platform 9 3/4 at King’s Cross station. It’s going to be a film about Eddie Redmayne’s Newt Scamander and his ever-expanding menagerie of magical creatures. It’s going to be about Jude Law’s Dumbledore battling Mads Mikkelsen’s Grindelwald, even though they once signed a blood pact promising never to fight each other. It’s going to be a film in which we all ask ourselves over and again why Rowling had to borrow a plot line from the Star Wars prequels and make lovable Queenie turn to the dark side in her desperate attempts to retain her romance with Jacob Kowalski. (By the way, where is Queenie’s sister and Newt’s future wife, Tina?) But most of all it’s going to be about the true identity of Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller), which will most likely (if the film’s title is to be believed) have something to do with something naughty Dumbledore did back in his tangled youth. This is the same Credence Barebone whom we were first introduced to as the moping son of an American anti-witchcraft campaigner in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016), but who was revealed by the end of the film to be something called an Obscurial, a wizard who ignores their own magical potential due to psychological torment. In Crimes of Grindelwald we were told Credence was in fact the long lost brother of Zoë Kravitz’s Leta Lestrange, Corvus Lestrange V (no, us neither). But by the end of that movie he probably wasn’t actually this either. According to Grindelwald (once played by Colin Farrell, then Johnny Depp, now Mikkelsen), he was actually Aurelius Dumbledore, Albus’s long-lost brother. But why should we trust anyone who has swapped faces more times than Doctor Who? The truth of Credence’s identity seems almost as befuddled as the apparently ever-shifting allegiances of Alan Rickman’s Professor Snape in the original Harry Potter books and movies, except a whole lot less interesting. The main issue here is that the Fantastic Beasts movies are prequels to the events of young Harry’s schooldays, and if Credence’s true identity were that of anyone crucial to Potter fandom, somebody would have worked it out by now. So why is Rowling so obsessed with him? Miller is doing an excellent job as Barebone, but he’s been through more tonal costume changes than Ron once went through shonky Christmas jumpers. Let’s hope the actor himself knows who he’s going to end up being, and why it all matters. And let’s hope the rest of us find out before we lose the will to live and take a (figurative) dive-bomb off Hogwarts’ tallest tower.",Arts/Film,Can Fantastic Beasts 3’s return to Hogwarts save JK Rowling’s Wizarding World?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/04/fantastic-beasts-3-secrets-of-dumbledoor-return-to-hogwarts-week-in-geek
3/4/2022,"So – what if your mum was John Wick? Or Jason Bourne, but with his memory intact? Or Jack Reacher only smaller? Such is the tasty question posed by Pieces of Her, a new Netflix thriller based on the 2018 Karin Slaughter bestseller. It seems unlikely that this is the first adaptation for television of Slaughter – who has been banging out addictive crime novels to great acclaim for the last 21 years, but it does seem to be the case. The Grant County and Will Trent series are in development but have not yet seen the light of day. Pieces of Her opens with depressed low-achiever Andy (Bella Heathcote) celebrating – though that’s not really the word – her 31st birthday with her concerned mother Laura (Toni Collette) at a local diner. When a shooter opens fire on the people at a nearby table, Laura takes charge, revealing the kind of ease and skill with various forms of weaponry – and a willingness to apply them fatally – that suggests Mommy might not be just the cuddly worrywart she appears. And with that, we’re off. The video that is – of course – taken of events in the diner by a bystander goes viral. Mommy’s face is all over the news and Andy soon comes home to find Laura tied to a chair and being asphyxiated by what turns out to be one of the many people who, for reasons as yet unknown, want her dead. Laura saves herself and bundles Andy out of the house with a burner phone and instructions on how to get to safety. She’s not to come home until and unless she hears Laura’s own voice on that very phone, saying it’s OK. Capisce? Andy quiveringly capisces and the next few hours are full of more murderous men, twists, turns, double pikes and tricky dismounts as Laura’s secret past is revealed and Andy has to deal with upending everything she thought she knew, plus all the untraceable cars and bobbins upon which her successful flight from murderous men depends. What can you say? It’s slick, the plot runs like clockwork and – just as with the book – you can walk away at the end feeling thoroughly entertained without being able to remember a solitary thing about it. It does raise two more issues than the book, however. The first is – why isn’t Collette in everything? Or at least a lot more than she is in? She is wholly credible, even in an expanding ocean of preposterousness, wholly in command of her performance, inevitably outclassing everyone but without upsetting the production. She should be both feted and employed more in recognition of these simple and salient facts. The second is to wonder why, with 35m copies of 21 novels sold in 120 countries, this is the first Slaughter we have seen on TV? There have been no films either, while Lee Child’s Reacher has had both, you couldn’t move for 90s John Grisham movies (he’s had his crack at television versions too) and you can’t throw a stick at a streaming platform at the moment without hitting a Harlan Coben or Harlan Coben-a-like adaptation. I hope this is not – gasp! – sexism rearing its ugly head again! Get Grant County up on screen ASAP and we’ll say no more about it.",Arts/Television & radio,Pieces of Her review – Toni Collette is a mum with a murderous past in this fun spy saga,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/04/pieces-of-her-review-toni-collette-is-a-mum-with-a-murderous-past-in-this-fun-spy-saga
3/4/2022,"For their 25th anniversary, Stereophonics were all set to compile a second greatest hits collection until singer Kelly Jones rummaged in his archive and found several unused old songs to contribute to a new album. Thus, Oochya! offers an occasionally uneven mix of their trusty hit formula (equal bits of the Faces and Oasis with a smidgeon of U2) and some newer mild diversions. Among the latter are raucous opener Hanging on Your Hinges – a spikier take on ZZ Top – and the candidly autobiographical Right Place Right Time, which adds a nostalgic colliery brass band sound to Jones’s reflections on the highs and lows of a life in rock. Otherwise Jones’s lyrical concerns mostly concern relationships, hope and a prevailing desire for escape – and at 15 tracks long, the cliches creep in. In the lovely Forever, Jones dreams of a flight away from all his troubles; he does the same in the equally tuneful When You See It. The Free-like Running Round My Brain is 1970s rock by numbers and filler such as Made a Mess of Me should have been left on the cutting-room floor. As ever, the best songs hit a reliably sweet spot between the emotional and the anthemic. A lovely, shimmering riff propels Do Ya Feel My Love, and Every Dog Has Its Day packs soul, keyboards and strings into a chorus made to be sung by swaying crowds.

3/4/2022,"Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim’s classic musical is here given a wonderful, respectful reworking by Steven Spielberg. Despite some visual callbacks to Robert Wise’s 1961 version, his 1957 New York is a darker, scuzzier place – the territorial rumbles between the Sharks and Jets play out in an urban landscape of demolition and decay, reinforcing the hollowness of their small victories. Ansel Elgort and Rachel Zegler, playing Tony and Maria – the Romeo and Juliet of this cross-cultural romance – make for a sweet couple but are upstaged by a fiery, forceful Ariana DeBose as Anita (particularly in a kinetic take on America) and Mike Faist as sinewy gang leader Riff.Out now, Disney+ Katherine Waterston and Vanessa Kirby perfectly balance delicate sensibility and submerged passion in this tale of the friendship and love between two farmers’ wives in mid 19th-century New York state. The death of their daughter has left Abigail (Waterston) emotionally closed off from her husband Dyer (Casey Affleck), but vivacious newcomer Tallie (Kirby) sparks something unexpected in her. Director Mona Fastvold tethers their lives to the unforgiving swing of the seasons as their affair slowly overwhelms them.Sunday 6 March, 12.20pm, 8pm Sky Cinema Premiere Philippa Lowthorpe’s drama – about the 1970 Miss World contest being disrupted by the women’s liberation movement – could have just been a righteous tale of feminist activists putting the boot in to a sexist event. And we do follow Keira Knightley and Jessie Buckley in their plot against the patriarchy – epitomised by Greg Kinnear’s smarmy host Bob Hope. But we’re also privy to the lives of the female contestants, particularly Gugu Mbatha-Raw’s Miss Grenada, for whom the “cattle market” is a rare opportunity for her as a Black woman to realise her dreams.Sunday 6 March, 9pm, BBC Two This film offers a comic, creative take on the potentially fraught story of a young woman who becomes pregnant but is far from the maternal type. Kristine Kujath Thorp’s Oslo-based Rakel is a would-be comic artist, so when she discovers she is six months gone already, she conjures up the foetus as an animated “sneaky ninjababy” – one who illuminates her thoughts and feelings through quirky if challenging asides. But Yngvild Sve Flikke’s drama does have a darker side too, as the disorganised, fearful Rakel deals with the dread prospect of motherhood.Monday 7 March, 12.10am, Film4 Melissa McCarthy’s magnificently unlikable lead character makes Marielle Heller’s real-life drama a prickly but highly rewarding watch. Lee Israel is a hard-up, alcoholic writer who is struggling to get her biography of actor Fanny Brice commissioned, so resorts to forging letters by famous dead people – and discovers both an income stream and a genuine talent. Richard E Grant has a ball as her deadbeat criminal sidekick Jack in a droll tale of hubris and greed in the literary world.Tuesday 8 March, 9pm, Film4 This 2017 Paul Thomas Anderson masterwork was Daniel Day-Lewis’s unexpected swansong as an actor, and his commitment to the role is total (he even spent a year learning dressmaking in preparation for it). His high-end 1950s fashion designer, Reynolds Woodcock, finds his obsessively controlled world – aided by sister Cyril (Lesley Manville) – thrown off-centre by Alma (Vicky Krieps), a waitress he seduces and then attempts to shape into a pliant muse. The push and pull of her resistance to – and love for – him gives their relationship a twisted power dynamic as finely detailed as one of his outfits.Tuesday 8 March, 11.15pm, BBC Two By now you know what to expect from this petrol-fuelled series of action films. Vin Diesel’s Dom will be drawn back into the spy game, along with his ever-expanding ragtag bunch of mates, to endure more preposterous but thrilling vehicular set pieces. But it’s real trump card is a focus on the importance of family – real or constructed. This surfaces again when Dom (white T-shirt) comes up against his brother Jakob (John Cena, black T-shirt), amid returning faces, peculiar cameos and a Helen Mirren-instigated car chase.Friday 11 March, 10.15am, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere",Arts/Television & radio,West Side Story to Misbehaviour: the seven best films to watch on TV this week,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/04/west-side-story-to-misbehaviour-the-seven-best-films-to-watch-on-tv-this-week
3/4/2022,"How should a refugee’s story be told? Matthieu Aikins, a Canadian journalist, seems to think the best way is gonzo reporting. In The Naked Don’t Fear the Water, he accompanies a thirtysomething Afghan interpreter, Omar, through Central Asia and Europe, passing himself off to others as an asylum seeker. Aikins takes up a new name, pretends not to understand English and at one point sets fire to one of his passports rather than have it discovered by police at the Turkish border. Aikins is attuned to a truth seldom acknowledged by travel writers and foreign correspondents: when confronted by the plight of stateless subjects, or of those forced to escape their home countries, the reporter is always aware of their own luck, their own unearned prerogative of belonging to one nation and not another. What wouldn’t Omar have done to qualify for a western passport? His chances of landing an American visa are negligible, despite having spent much of his adult life translating for foreign troops and driving story-hungry journalists around in the middle of a war. When fighting between US troops and the Taliban intensified six years ago, he joined the exodus out of the country through Iran and Turkey, leaving behind his girlfriend, Laila, in Kabul. Together with Aikins, he made the dreaded journey across the Mediterranean in an inflatable boat, and ended up in a refugee camp in Lesbos, Greece, effectively imprisoned. The camp at Lesbos has been described by doctors as a “living hell”, with more than 12,000 people forced to compete with each other for food, housing, medical care and clean toilets. The asylum process is frustratingly opaque, and Afghans are lower in the pecking order than Syrians and Iraqis. Aikins describes how those inside the camp end up imbibing that logic, referring to certain fellow inmates as “not real refugees”. “The migrants were learning to see themselves through western eyes.” Aikins is an effective storyteller: the momentum of the narrative is never overwhelmed by all the post-trip reading and research he brings in. And yet the reader can’t help but feel that Omar’s ordeal is his alone. Aikins can at any point have his second passport mailed to him, or reveal his true identity to camp officials and leave the island. Omar, on the other hand, procures a fake passport and risks being caught at the airport in Lesbos. He ends up in Athens, where he shares a room with Aikins in a makeshift refugee squat. This is a story in which hapless migrants find themselves at the mercy of greedy people-smugglers at every checkpoint, with no recourse but to pay them off with their life’s savings. But it is the state that is the greater predator, pitting refugees against one another, deporting them at will and ultimately trapping vulnerable people in a Kafkaesque loop of survival and incarceration.

3/4/2022,"Paul McCartney, Kendrick Lamar and Olivia Rodrigo have been announced as among the stars performing at this summer’s Glastonbury festival. Out of the 89 names announced so far, 48 are women or acts that include female artists, meeting festival co-organiser Emily Eavis’s previously stated intention for Glastonbury to achieve gender parity on its bill. “Our future has to be 50/50,” she told the BBC in 2020. The festival, which was cancelled for the last two years, makes its return with McCartney as Saturday night headliner – his second time atop the Pyramid stage, having performed in 2004 – and Pulitzer prize-winning rapper Lamar, who will make his debut at the festival to close the Pyramid Stage on the Sunday night. It had already been announced that Billie Eilish will make her second appearance at Worthy Farm in Somerset on the Pyramid stage, along with Diana Ross, who will be following in the footsteps of fellow veteran superstars including Dolly Parton, Lionel Richie and James Brown in the Sunday “teatime legend” slot. Eilish is among a strong pop presence at the festival, with Rodrigo, Doja Cat, Megan Thee Stallion, Charli XCX and Caroline Polachek all appearing.The festival will also feature debut sets from Herbie Hancock, Phoebe Bridgers, Sam Fender, Turnstile, TLC, Wet Leg and Yves Tumor. Other acts announced include Kacey Musgraves, Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds, Pet Shop Boys, Foals, Haim, Lorde and Robert Plant, who will appear alongside Alison Krauss. The names announced are the first shortlist of acts for this year’s festival, which takes place on 22-26 June. The full lineup is expected to be published in May. McCartney and Lamar were among the headline acts for the cancelled festival in 2020, which would have been its 50th anniversary year. Taylor Swift was also due to headline in 2020, but thus far does not appear to be performing this year. Prior to the announcement, McCartney teased the news on Twitter in the form of a Wordle clue. He used six squares rather than the traditional five, presumably to hint at the word “Glasto” – and not “Mexico”, to the chagrin of hopeful South American fans. He gave the game the number 121 and wrote 25/6 in the field that usually indicates how many attempts it took for the player to correctly guess the word to reveal the date of his performance: When he tweeted the clue, on 24 February, it was 121 days until 25 June, which he is due to play. Wordle 121 25/6🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩 This year’s Glastonbury will act as a belated birthday celebration for McCartney, who turns 80 on 18 June, making him the oldest ever headliner at the festival. By contrast, the Friday night headliner Eilish will be the festival’s youngest ever solo headliner. Festival organiser Emily Eavis said: “It really is so exciting to be back. And it feels like we all need it. Everywhere I go, people tell me how much they’re looking forward to the festival’s return and how they’ve all been waiting for it.

3/4/2022,"We yearn to help. Wrong must be put right. Something must be done. The agony was plain on Boris Johnson’s face as a Ukrainian berated him for refusing to impose a no-fly zone on Russia. When an outrage is being perpetrated and untold numbers of people are dying hourly on our screens, impotence is misery. So we loudly voice our support of Ukraine. We hate Vladimir Putin, hate oligarchs, hate Russians. It eases our pain. The early stages of war are always moments when reason is told to leave. As the drums of battle roll, courage demands emotion and unity is all. The only resolution is death or glory. Talk of compromise is treason. This is especially true in Europe, with its long history of bilateral conflicts that demand to be seen as “world wars”. There are specific actions that Britain can take to ease Ukraine’s suffering, and Britain has been clearly reluctant to take them. The most immediate is to throw open Britain’s borders to Ukrainian refugees, as EU countries have done with their plans to allow Ukrainians to live and work in the EU for up to three years. London’s Home Office, clearly under orders, turned back desperate refugees in Paris, demanding work-related visas and “security clearance”. There are also reports of border bureaucracy at the Channel stalling humanitarian supplies from local aid centres. The sacred rituals of Johnson’s Brexit must outrank even Putin’s war. Beyond that, horror at what Putin is doing must be expressed through the instrument of economic sanctions, the hope being that he will see the error of his ways or be toppled in a coup. The difficulty is that the very fact of war as the ultimate expression of a nation’s will reduces all other aspects of statehood to irrelevance. Once under arms, a ruler such as Putin, who has been the target of severe sanctions for eight years, is plainly deaf to their impact. Democracies allow dissent – though even Britain seems unable to tolerate RT’s pro-Russian propaganda – but dictatorships tend to be strengthened not undermined by economic siege. Coups are always unpredictable, and we can only pray that Moscow 2022 will be the exception that disproves the rule. It is puzzling, therefore, that the west is weakening its case by continuing to buy Russian oil and gas. Most bizarre is the fate of the eccentric bystanders of this drama, the so-called oligarchs. This freemasonry of mostly expatriate Russians has, for 20 years, been feted with open arms in London, with gilded retinues of lawyers, accountants and lifestyle consultants. Their “golden visas” and party donations enable them to come and go as they please. They are permitted to hide from taxation, regulation and scrutiny behind shuttered Georgian windows, empty tower blocks and in secretive British Overseas Territories. While in times past Putin is known to have had links with such people, I have seen no report out of Moscow that indicates they nowadays enjoy any access to or influence over him, let alone the power to reverse war or depose him. Recent books by Catherine Belton, Oliver Bullough and others depict him rather as a mafia boss, terrorising the oligarchs with a mix of extortions, bribes, imprisonment and attempted murder. But to a desperate British government they are the only manifestations of Russian power to hand, and must be hurled symbolically on to Putin’s pyre. This is not an attack on Russia so much as a massive course correction in Britain’s attitude to foreign money. It would be truly ironic if it took the invasion of Ukraine to cure London of its favouritism towards money launderers, many of whom are Ukrainian. No one can calculate the sums appropriated to Britain from Russia’s sovereign assets since 1989, as from other sources of dodgy cash from Africa, the Gulf and the far east. The British Treasury has long been a co-conspirator in depriving countries around the world of their rightful revenues. The manifestation of this in London is the conversion of its more salubrious districts into storehouses of vagrant money. It remains outrageous that individuals can buy and leave vacant whole streets and tower blocks in the middle of a capital city. They are charged less than £3,000 in annual council tax for multimillion-pound properties that in New York would be taxed at 50 times that, with local and national income tax on top. The latest research from Transparency International estimates that 40% of luxury properties on the London market now go to “suspect” buy-to-leave investors. Johnson has long been wildly in favour of this racket. As mayor of London he called these luxury properties a “thrilling inward investment”. He toured Malaysia to help sell empty properties at Battersea Power Station and dismissed any critics as “gloomadon poppers”. As many have found, nothing is more dangerous than to have Johnson as a fan. If he cannot topple Putin, he is determined to at least humble some of his former associates. But what will he do? Confiscate private houses, fine their owners for being Russian, expel them from the country? Unless they are criminals, we surely do not punish people for their nationality. I enjoy the company of many Russians and, unlike the government, I do not hold them responsible for their monstrous ruler. News that Roman Abramovich feels he must sell his London palace and football team will not lift spirits in a Kyiv bunker or lose Putin much sleep. If this really signals the end of a long-running London scandal, then good. But what is needed is action, not words. The current economic assault on Russia and Russians is unprecedented and its outcome is therefore impossible to predict. Feelgood sanctions in the past have inflicted poverty and injustice on peoples around the world to no political or other benefit. We can only wait to see if Russia capitulates to them. For the time being, I am left hoping only that a few oligarch mansions in Kensington find their way into the hands of Ukrainian refugees.

3/4/2022,"For many decades, western record labels such as HMV, Folkways, Ocora, Kaleidophone and Nonesuch Explorer would send ethnomusicologists with lathe cutters or tape machines to make field recordings in Africa, documenting drummers from Burundi, flute-playing Baka pygmies, or the polyphonic Banda horn players of the Central African Republic. The results were often fascinating but voyeuristic, presenting a musical world where the actual musicians were passive rather than active participants. Nyokabi Kariūki is part of a new generation of African musicians who are using field recordings to explore something more personal, taping the sounds of nature and people to explore notions of home, of ancestry, of dislocation and of the relationships between natural and digital worlds. Kariūki grew up in Kenya, played classical piano from an early age, moved to the United States to study composition at NYU, and is now based between Nairobi, New York and Maryland. Her debut album uses recordings she made in Kenya on her phone or video camera, often time-stretched and layered with tuned percussion, electronic textures and multi-tracked voices to create heavenly soundscapes. There is a recording of her feeding mangos to noisy goats, but it is blended with gospel-style vocal harmonies and the sound of tuned percussion played on clay pots. On A Walk Through My Cũcũ’s Farm, you can hear Kariūki and her grandmother talking in Swahili about lessons learned from nature, but the footsteps and voices are accompanied by a quiet riot of harmonised humming, farmer’s whistles and electronic percussion. Galu was recorded before she swam in the Indian Ocean, near Mombasa, and the sound of lapping water is echoed by a series of jazzy cymbal improvisations and harmonised voices. Best of all is Equator Song, in which recordings of chirruping weaver birds are shadowed by a babbling, multi-tracked choir of digital voices and a robotic vocal, also chanted in Swahili. It is a wonderfully disorientating piece: fully grounded in nature but utterly transcendent in its scope and space-age in its sonic ambition. Open (Hush Hush Records) is a fine collaboration between Finnish woodwind player Tapani Rinne and composer Juha Mäki-Patola, a series of haunting tenor sax and keyboard duets that explore the hinterlands between ECM jazz, ambient soundscapes and drone-based minimalism. Ana Carla Maza is a Havana-born cellist, composer and singer whose album Bahia (Persona Editorial Records) is a gorgeous multilingual voyage through Cuban, Brazilian, Argentine and Peruvian songcraft. What’s particularly remarkable is that she recorded this entirely live and unaccompanied, leaping between double-stopped bowed passages, jazz-like bass lines and guitar-like chords like a one-woman chamber orchestra.",Arts/Music,"Nyokabi Kariūki: Peace Places: Kenyan Memories review – sounds of nature, people and home",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/04/nyokabi-kariuki-peace-places-kenyan-memories-review
