2/23/2022,"An inquiry into allegations that Israel’s police force systematically hacked into the mobile phones of Israeli citizens has found that while the police did use NSO Group’s controversial Pegasus malware, there is no evidence suggesting illegality. In a series of explosive reports over the last two months, the local financial daily Calcalist accused the police of spying on at least 26 individuals who were not criminal suspects. Those named included politicians, protesters, and members of the former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s inner circle – claims Netanyahu used to delay proceedings in his corruption trial.  Israel’s attorney general’s office ordered an investigation into the alleged police behaviour last month. On Monday, the Israeli justice ministry contradicted the most serious of the newspaper’s claims, saying an interim inquiry discovered “no indication” that the police had bypassed judicial authorisation in using the spyware. In two instances, unsuccessful attempts were made to hack the phones of people subject to court orders authorising the tracking of their electronic communications, and in a third case the police succeeded, the probe found. It also said investigators looked into the use of a second type of spyware available to police and again found no signs of wrongdoing. The announcement still represents the first time the Israeli government has confirmed that Pegasus has been deployed against a citizen. A consortium of 17 media outlets, including the Guardian, revealed last year that the Israeli-made surveillance product had been sold to repressive governments worldwide and used to surveil activists, journalists and lawyers, as well as government officials and heads of state. NSO has previously said that all its sales are government-authorised and that it does not itself run Pegasus. Israel says it has since tightened rules on the export of cyberweapons, and NSO was blacklisted by the US in November. The Israeli state and private firms have developed sophisticated surveillance systems to monitor the activities of people in the occupied Palestinian territories, where Israel implements military law. Senior NSO officials had previously said, however, that its software was not authorised for use against Israeli and US telephone numbers – reassurances that subsequently caused public outrage when the Calcalist allegations were published earlier this year. The claims were strongly denied by the police service. An editorial carried by Calcalist on Tuesday acknowledged that the deputy attorney general Amit Merari’s initial findings necessitated “a review of the paper’s allegations”. NSO, which has been fighting a mounting tide of criticism, welcomed the justice ministry’s announcement, saying in a statement that the company hoped the conclusions “will result in reporting that no longer relies upon misinformation and political organisations issuing biased and prejudiced reports”. Questions remain over whether current Israeli privacy law, which came into force in 1981, is fit to handle the technical intricacies of modern spyware. Cybersecurity experts have previously suggested that Israeli court orders are not sufficient for authorising the use of invasive malware such as Pegasus. Merari’s investigation utilising the technological expertise of the Shin Bet and the Mossad – Israel’s domestic and foreign intelligence agencies – continues. Her team will examine whether spying software was used without court orders on individuals other than those mentioned in the Calcalist reports, and whether the police exceeded their authority in using spyware on citizens, the justice ministry said.",News/World news,"Police use of Pegasus malware not illegal, Israeli inquiry finds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/police-use-of-pegasus-malware-not-israeli-inquiry-finds
2/23/2022,"The doors to the Russian embassy in Kyiv were shut on Tuesday. Seemingly nobody was at home. Outside on the street a small, noisy crowd of demonstrators waved blue and yellow Ukrainian flags. “We are not afraid of Vladimir Putin. Or his army,” said one activist, Roman Tyschenko. Behind him protesters banged kettle drums and broke into a rhythmic chant of “Putin huiylo”, to blaring music from a loudspeaker. “It means Putin is a motherfucker,” Tyschenko explained. “It’s our anthem. Football fans in Kharkiv invented the song in 2014, when Russia stole Crimea.”  After a meeting with his security council on Monday in Moscow Vladimir Putin recognised the so-called breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent. In a long, and menacing speech he also asserted that Ukraine was not a state, but a historical mistake made by Lenin. “Putin is insane, crazy,” Tyschenko said. “Ukraine is both a country and a state. We have ancient traditions. Kyiv was founded before Moscow. We have a much longer record of nationhood.” The threat of war hangs over Kyiv, a city of 3 million people, plus another million who commute daily from its suburbs. The US and UK governments believe Putin’s ambitions go beyond the Donbas region, whose separatist administrations Moscow has long armed and propped up. They believe that Russia’s president is poised to attack and encircle the Ukrainian capital, sending in tanks and troops currently parked two hours’ drive away, just across the border in Belarus. The talk among intelligence professionals is of Baghdad-style shock and awe. His goal: to subjugate Ukraine. And yet so far Kyiv residents have reacted to the situation with an collective weapon: carrying on as normal. Cafes and restaurant were open on Tuesday, mothers pushed their toddlers through parks bathed in spring sunshine, and cyclists bumped over cobbled streets. A few more flags were visible than usual, attached to cars and adorned with the slogan: “Believe in Ukraine.” Otherwise there was no hint that the country might soon be at war, or that Kyiv could find itself occupied by a foreign army. “We will defend our country,” one activist, Serhii Ikonnikov, said, standing outside the Russian embassy, a grey neo-classical building topped with razor wire. He added: “In the history of war there is the question of motivation. The Russian army doesn’t have it. “We do. We will defend our country, our homes and our families. If Putin invades, lots of Russian blood will be spilled.” Was he afraid? “A bit. Not for myself but for my relatives,” he said. Next to him protesters held signs saying: “Donbas is Ukrainian”, “We will never retreat” and “Evil empire”. Ikonnikov, who is 23, added: “There’s also some kind of excitement. If Putin invades us it will be the end of Russia. It will be the start of a wonderful new Europe, and of Ukraine as a member of that Europe.” In another part of Kyiv – a picturesque glass bridge spanning the turquoise Dnipro river – friends and couples posed for photos. Sitting on a bench, Denis Astapenko said Russia was trying to spook Ukrainians with a disinformation campaign. “There are a lot of rumours,” he said. “For myself I’m calm.” Astapenko, a wedding photographer, said he had done portraits of a couple who got married in Kyiv on Tuesday morning. His order book was full, he said, with further shoots lined up for later this week. A favourite wedding shot location was the bridge, with its panoramic views, he added. In the nearby Volodymrska Girka park a statue of Vladimir the Great looked out over the embattled capital. It was Vladimir who converted Kyivan Rus’ (alternative spelling: Kievan Rus’) – a princely state founded in Kyiv in the 10th century – to Christianity. At the time Moscow didn’t exist, Astapenko noted. Olga Machevska, a retired librarian, said Putin’s view of Ukraine’s history was entirely wrong and stupid. “He needs to go back to the archive,” she said. “We had Kyivan Rus’. In the 11th century we built St Sophia’s cathedral. In Moscow there was nothing: just woods.” Over at city hall, a grandiose building on Kyiv’s main Khreshchatyk boulevard, done in postwar Stalinist style, the head of civil defence, Roman Tkachuk, said there was no reason to panic. “We are ready for any emergency situation,” he said. “We are highly prepared.” Tkachuk said Kyiv now had a network of 5,000 bomb shelters including 47 Soviet-era metro stations, dug deep underground. There was enough space for the city’s residents, he said, with purpose-built basements in hospitals, bread factories and other critical facilities. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has so far taken no obvious steps to fortify Kyiv from Russian military attack. He has previously berated the US and UK for moving their embassies out of the capital, and relocating them to Lviv, close to the Polish border, in the west of the country. Was Zelenskiy’s optimism that nothing would befall Kyiv a mistake? “If I give an order to put sandbags outside government buildings or to tape up windows that will cause concern,” Tkachuk said, adding there were plans in place if evacuation became necessary, with the city authorities ready to help the old and infirm. One fear is that Russian combat planes may seek to knock out mobile phone and internet services, as well as electricity and power, leaving a terrified population in the cold and dark. Tkachuk said there were plans to send police cars with megaphones round the streets, in order to deliver public order messages, if TV stations went down. “I will be the last person to leave the city,” he said. “My family lives here, my mother lives here. I’m not going anywhere.”",News/World news,‘We’re not afraid of Putin’: defiance on the streets of Kyiv,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/not-afraid-putin-defiance-streets-kyiv-russia-protest
2/23/2022,"An MP rejected an approach from a lobbyist group who told her it planned to set up an all party parliamentary group for the night-time economy, which was to be sponsored by alcohol firms. Alison Thewliss said it was “unusual” to be propositioned by lobbyists rather than an MP, even if there may have been merit in such a cross-party group.  The MP was speaking after it was revealed last week that more than £13m has been poured into a growing network of MPs’ interest groups by private firms – fuelling concerns over the potential for backdoor influence. In emails to Thewliss in 2019, a lobby group called Connect Communications said sponsorship was needed “to make the group viable”. One read: “We’re very keen to get it off the ground and hope to have you involved … We’ll keep you updated as we gage [sic] interest from other MPs, and once we begin talking to external organisations about sponsorship.” Connect Communications, which is co-owned and run by the former Labour MP Andy Sawford, currently runs 15 APPG secretariats. The secretariats of APPGs, of which there are now 755, arrange meetings and trips for members and sometimes cultivate potential funders. A spokesperson for the company said: “In 2019, there was an initiative from parliamentarians and outside organisations to form an APPG on the night-time economy and Connect were involved in these discussions. “Connect offered to provide secretariat services, to support good practice and compliance with the rules on APPGs, although this was not taken forward and we are not involved.” A night-time economy APPG was subsequently established with the help of a different lobbying firm, Tendo Consulting. The APPG received more than £7,500 worth of “benefits in kind” from the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), which acts as the group’s secretariat, last year. The NTIA says on its website that it “lobbies nationally” on behalf of the pubs and clubs it represents across the UK. The APPG last year published a 46-page report on the impact of Covid on the industry, calling on the government to extend tax breaks for the sector. Although described as ‘an APPG inquiry’ the report was researched by Tendo Consulting and funded by the NTIA. Thewliss, SNP MP for Glasgow Central, who chairs three APPGs, said she believed there is a pressing need for greater transparency more broadly about the funding of APPGS and the role of commercial interests. She said: “Some of them clearly do attract quite a lot of money. It is difficult for MPs to run these things – in offices it takes up our own time and can be quite burdensome but if you have another organisation funding it you need to have that transparency and ask questions about the outcome of it.” Jeff Smith, the Labour MP who chairs the APPG, told openDemocracy the report was “a good piece of work which gives an accurate reflection of the plight of the industry at the time”. On its involvement in the report, Tendo said it had “a wealth of experience in research techniques and knowledge across numerous sectors of the UK economy”. The NTIA said Smith had “provided his input and ultimately signed it off.” Tendo, the NTIA and Smith have been approached for comment. A former Liberal Democrat MP who now chairs a pressure group campaigning for democratic reform said that the investigation last week had reported on what he described as an “unsavoury aspect of APPGs: the influence lobbyists funded by industry can buy”. Tom Brake, who was deputy leader of the House of Commons during the coalition government, also suggested MPs should be banned from membership of the groups seeking to influence policy in areas where the MPs had a personal financial interest. The veteran Labour MP and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said that the investigation “exposes deep concerns about the role of APPGs.” He added: “There now needs to be a full and independent inquiry into their role. We need to ensure that there are not just proper standards and procedures but proper policing of these groups.”",News/Politics,MP rebuffed lobbyist’s plan for parliamentary group funded by drinks firms,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/22/mp-rebuffed-lobbyist-over-plan-for-mps-group-to-support-night-time-economy
2/23/2022,"One of Wall Street’s most fearsome activist investors has launched a campaign to force McDonald’s to change the way it buys pork for its Bacon McDouble Cheeseburgers, Sausage McMuffins and McRib sandwiches. Carl Icahn, whose long history as an asset stripper precedes him, plans to challenge the practice used by some of McDonald’s pork suppliers of confining pregnant pigs in small crates and not in group housing.  Ichan is best known as an aggressive investor whose history spans hostile efforts to take over companies ranging from TWA, Marvel Comics, RJR Nabisco and US Steel, sometimes ruthlessly “downsizing” companies he takes over. He owns just 200 shares in McDonalds, valued at approximately $50,000 – far less than the multimillion stakes he typically acquires in companies he targets. But he is using his holding – and his reputation – to push for Leslie Samuelrich, a sustainability-focused investor and president of Green Century Capital Management, and Maisie Ganzler, an executive at Bon Appétit, a restaurant management company, to be put on McDonald’s board. The fast-food giant promised 10 years ago to end its suppliers’ crate practice and said Sunday that it expects to source 85% to 90% of its US pork from pigs not housed in “gestation stalls” during pregnancy, up from 60% currently, by the end of this year. But Icahn, who became involved in the issue at the behest of his daughter, Michelle Icahn Nevin, says he had expected the use of the crates to be banned altogether, not merely have sows moved from crates only after they are confirmed pregnant four to six weeks into their 16-week term. McDonald’s said it would be “impossible” to meet Icahn’s request to end the practice immediately as it would go against “veterinary science” and “harm the company’s shared pursuit of providing customers with quality product at accessible prices.” And McDonald’s did not welcome Icahn’s intrusion, saying in a statement in response to Icahn’s notification that it would “evaluate the nominees as it would any other candidates proposed to it” at its annual shareholder meeting in April. “Mr Icahn’s stated focus in making this nomination relates to a narrow issue regarding the Company’s pork commitment, which The Humane Society US has already introduced through a shareholder proposal,” the company said. The investor’s efforts to pressure McDonald’s comes a year after several members of Exxon’s board of directors were pushed out in a shake-up by activist shareholders looking for the oil giant to act decisively on climate change. Icahn told Bloomberg TV last week that he was committed to taking action, despite McDonald’s explanation that outbreaks of swine disease and the Covid-19 pandemic delayed producers’ ability to meet its original timeline by two years. “We’re not going to fool around with them any more,” he said. But the company shot back, critiquing Icahn for his majority holdings in Viskase, a firm that produces packaging, such as sausage casings, for pork and poultry. “It’s noteworthy that Icahn has not publicly called on Viskase to adopt commitments.” The conflict also highlights the limited and often slow progress that food producers have made in altering their supply chains. McDonald’s says it sources only approximately 1% of US pork production and does not own any sows, or produce or package pork in the US. “More than ever, our customers want to know how their food is produced and where it comes from,” the company posted on its Animal Health & Welfare page, adding that it is using its size and global reach “to improve animal health and welfare” and “source chicken, eggs, beef and pork from producers who share our commitments.” A 2005 study commissioned by the American Society of Swine Veterinarians asserted that “pigs are explorative by nature, and exploratory behavior is considered an important component of pig welfare.” The study noted “the difficulty experienced by sows in advanced gestation when the space is restricted,” adding that “it appears that increasing available space in gestation stalls would improve sow welfare.”",News/Business,Carl Icahn pressuring McDonald’s to improve welfare of pigs raised for meat,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/carl-icahn-pressuring-mcdonalds-improve-welfare-pigs
2/23/2022,"After a student’s failed attempt at creating rocket fuel in a dorm room displaced 22 people, police at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Utah reminded students to “keep your experiments in the lab”. The unnamed student attempted to concoct homemade rocket fuel on a stove in their dorm on Sunday afternoon.  The “volatile mixture suddenly exploded into a fireball”, the BYU police department said in a Facebook announcement. “The flames from the explosion engulfed the walls and ceiling around the stove and the intense heat tripped the fire sprinkler system,” police added. Firefighters secured the scene quickly and were able to put out the fire. Photos released by the police department revealed black explosion marks across kitchen cabinets, walls and ceilings. A living room – apparently complete with a toilet, lid open, next to a sofa – appeared to be flooded with several inches of water, as a result of the sprinkler system. Nobody was injured, police said. However, 22 dorm residents were displaced due to flooding “caused by this kitchen chemist experiment”, which resulted in “extensive damage to the building”. In an update on Monday, police said the “Rocket Man” case was an active investigation. “We urge students to be aware of circumstances around them and consider how their actions have the potential to [a]ffect not just themselves but others as well,” police said.",News/US news, Utah student displaces 22 in dorm after attempt to create rocket fuel on stove,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/22/brigham-young-university-student-rocket-fuel-dorm
2/23/2022,"Labour has called for a ban on the Russian state-backed broadcaster RT, accusing the channel of pumping out pro-Vladimir Putin “propaganda”. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, told MPs that the Russian president’s “campaign of misinformation should be tackled”, starting with moves to prevent RT from “broadcasting its propaganda around the world”.  The English-language channel is regulated by Ofcom, which said on Monday it would prioritise any complaints about any broadcast coverage of Ukraine “given the seriousness of the crisis”. “All licensees must observe Ofcom’s rules, including due accuracy and due impartiality,” an Ofcom spokesperson said. “If broadcasters break those rules, we will not hesitate to step in.” RT’s coverage of the situation in Ukraine has been overwhelmingly from a pro-Russian perspective, since Putin ordered his military to enter the Russian-controlled areas of Luhansk and Donetsk following a decision to recognise the self-proclaimed republics as independent territories. News segments also discussed the US, UK and EU responses to the crisis and showed footage of Johnson warning of the possibility of war and bringing in sanctions. But on-the-ground reports were largely from the perspective of celebrations in the territories, with a strapline and headline news of “fireworks, Russian flags, Donbass cheers Russian recognition”, interviews with jubilant residents, and Russian citizens who have “selflessly opened their doors” to refugees. The broadcaster also showcased a series of pro-Moscow and anti-Nato commentators on Tuesday, alongside a segment on the west’s “lies” about having previously promised not to expand Nato in the 1990s. Ofcom looked at complaints against RT as recently as earlier this month and decided not to investigate. It also decided not to take any action over RT’s broadcast licence in the wake of the Salisbury poisoning. At the time, it said state broadcasters “vary greatly in the extent to which they accept and conduct themselves according to UK and generally accepted international values” and which will “sometimes commit, or will have committed, acts which are contrary to these values”. It added: “In our judgment, it would be inappropriate for Ofcom always to place decisive weight on such matters in determining whether state-funded broadcasters were fit and proper to hold broadcast licences, independently of their broadcasting record. “If we did, many state-funded broadcasters [mostly those from states which may not share UK values] would be potentially not fit and proper. This would be a poorer outcome for UK audiences in light of our duties on plurality, diversity and freedom of expression.” In a section on RT, a commentator, Afshin Rattansi, responded to Starmer’s call for RT to be banned by saying Britain “has a long history of free speech” and suggesting anyone who thought it was propaganda could switch off. “We are still broadcasting here at the moment in Britain … We should be hoping that NGOs for free speech – from [Reporters Without Borders] and Amnesty International – will be there to defend this channel against Sir Keir Starmer and the British Labour party who want to ban free speech.” The presenter added that the channel’s mantra was to “question more” the mainstream narratives and asked whether western viewers would be getting only a one-sided perspective if RT was not broadcasting in their countries.",News/Politics,Labour party calls for ban on Russian broadcaster RT,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/22/labour-party-calls-for-ban-on-russian-broadcaster-rt
2/23/2022,"The French far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has postponed several campaign events because she is yet to secure the 500 endorsements from elected officials needed to qualify for the first round of the vote. Le Pen, the leader of the nationalist-populist National Rally, is lying second in the polls and is widely considered to be Emmanuel Macron’s most likely opponent in a second-round runoff on 24 April.  But Le Pen’s team said on Tuesday she was postponing two events – a press conference on her education policy scheduled for Wednesday and a trip to the northern Somme region on Saturday – to try to drum up more signatures before the deadline in 10 days’ time. All candidates in France’s presidential race must secure the endorsement of at least 500 of the more than 40,000 MPs, MEPs, senators, regional councillors and mayors, from at least 30 different départements and overseas territories, before 6pm on 4 March. The requirement, introduced by Charles de Gaulle in 1962 with a threshold of 100, was meant to limit the number of candidates but has been widely criticised over concerns it may exclude popular candidates from outside the political mainstream. Le Pen released a video on Monday appealing to mayors to endorse her run and saying she was still 50 names short. According to the Constitutional Council, which receives and verifies the signatures, she has 393 – more than 100 fewer than necessary. The far-right leader told French radio her position was “democratically terrifying”, calling on mayors to endorse her if they “find it really extremely serious that someone who can win this election cannot, for administrative reasons, take part”. Le Pen’s far-right rival, the TV polemicist Éric Zemmour, has cancelled a planned trip to the Indian Ocean island of Réunion, insisting he was “not suspending my campaign but shrinking it, because we still do not have these endorsements”. Zemmour, who is only marginally behind Le Pen in the polls, has 350 signatures, while Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the radical-left France Unbowed, polling at 11%, is short of about 60 endorsements, according to the council’s latest list. The prime minister, Jean Castex, appealed to elected officials on Monday to endorse candidates, saying only 10,000 out of the 42,000 who were eligible had done so. “The act of endorsing a candidate is not automatically synonymous with political backing. It is also a democratic act,” Castex told MPs. He said he would meet local mayors’ associations to underline the importance of popular candidates being able to stand. Macron, who polls predict will win a second term regardless of whom he faces in the runoff, has yet to formally declare himself a candidate, having devoted the past days and weeks to frantic last-ditch diplomatic efforts to avert a war in Ukraine. He is expected to announce his candidacy next week. Analysts said on Tuesday that even if his hopes of preventing Russian tanks from rolling towards Kyiv were dashed, voters were likely to give him credit for having tried. “Even if he fails with the Russians, he will have emerged as leading the European effort,” Philippe Moreau Chevrolet, of the public relations firm MCBG, told Agence-France Presse, adding that the crisis had placed Macron at the centre of media attention and public debate and “completely removed the opposition from view”.",News/World news,Marine Le Pen calls off events and appeals for mayors’ endorsements,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/marine-le-pen-calls-off-events-and-appeals-for-mayors-endorsements
2/23/2022,"Kyle Rittenhouse, the teen who shot dead two men and injured another during anti-racism protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in 2020, has announced the formation of a group to fund lawsuits against reporters – and also Whoopi Goldberg.  In November, after a controversial trial, Rittenhouse was found not guilty on all charges related to the shootings, which he carried out with an assault rifle while purportedly providing security in the protest-racked city. He has since emerged as a rightwing celebrity. He spoke to Tucker Carlson on Fox News on Monday night. “Me and my team have decided to launch the Media Accountability Project,” Rittenhouse said, “as a tool to help fundraise and hold the media accountable for the lies they say and deal with them in court”. Carlson asked if “like the Covington Catholic kids” – high-schoolers from Kentucky who became embroiled in controversial events on the National Mall in Washington in 2019 – “you will be suing news organisations that maliciously lie about people who are in the news?” “Yes, sir,” Rittenhouse said. “We’re going to be holding them accountable, Tucker.” Rittenhouse, 19, repeatedly drank from a water bottle and added: “I don’t want to see anybody else have to deal with what I went through. So I want to hold them accountable for what they did to me, because I don’t want to see anybody have to go through what I went through.” Carlson asked if Rittenhouse had any particular targets. “Well,” he said, “right now we’re looking at quite a few politicians, celebrities, athletes. Whoopi Goldberg is on the list. She called me a murderer, after I was acquitted by a jury of my peers.” Goldberg, a co-host of The View on ABC, said of Rittenhouse: “Even all the excuses in the world does not change the fact that three people got shot. Two people were murdered. To me it’s murder. I’m sorry.” Rittenhouse said: “Don’t forget about Cenk [Uygur] from the Young Turks, he called me a murderer before I was acquitted and continues to call me a murderer.” Most observers agree such speech is protected under the first amendment to the US constitution. David Shuster, a former MSNBC anchor now with Young Turks, tweeted: “The courts have long established that calling somebody a ‘murderer’ is an opinion and a legal right, even after the person is found ‘not guilty’.” “At that point, one can still call them a murderer, just not a ‘convicted murderer’. Nobody has called Rittenhouse that. He has no case.” Rittenhouse shot the three men at a protest over the shooting by a white police officer of a Black man, Jacob Blake. The case was racially charged but the men Rittenhouse shot were white. He told Carlson he would also target people who called him a white supremacist. “We are going to hold everybody who’s lied about me accountable, such as everybody who’s lied, called me a white supremacist. They’re all going to be held accountable, and we’re going to handle them in a courtroom.” Rittenhouse’s announcement comes amid heightened rightwing rhetoric over perceived mistreatment by the mainstream press. Earlier this month, the former Alaska governor and vice-presidential pick Sarah Palin lost a defamation case against the New York Times, over an op ed about gun violence. Many on the right think US defamation and libel law should be changed. Some think the supreme court, dominated 6-3 by conservatives, may soon be open to such a shift. Some on the left have hinted at counter-measures. Last week, both Hillary Clinton and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested that attacks by Fox News anchors might be actionable in court. On Monday night, Rittenhouse also gave a web address for donations.

2/23/2022,"Hundreds of customers of First Direct have been victims of fraudsters who have used their card details to place orders at Nando’s. Cardholders received notifications of the payments last week, with some reporting that more than £100 had been spent on their account apparently at the fast food chain’s website.  One customer said she received a text from the bank querying a £41.98 payment to the chain, while on online forums others said they had spotted multiple transactions on their account. In an email seen by the Guardian, the bank told a cardholder who had been defrauded: “Unfortunately, many customers including customers from other banking institutions, were victims of fraudulent transactions to Nando’s.” It added that it was “experiencing a high volume of fraudulent transactions to this retailer at the moment”. On the Moneysavingexpert website one First Direct customer said that after being alerted to a suspicious transaction from Nando’s for £26, they called the bank. “They had already paid out £114 in 6 transactions over 4 days, all to Nando’s, so the fraudster got away with £114 before FD thought to inform me,” the person said. A First Direct spokesperson said: “We are aware of some low-value unauthorised retail transactions appearing on a small number of our customers’ cards. “We want to reassure impacted customers that they will not be left out of pocket and apologise for any inconvenience caused. We take our customers’ security very seriously and will be reaching out to affected customers in the coming days.” The spokesperson advised customers to check their statements regularly and get in touch if they notice any suspicious activity. A Nando’s spokesperson: “We are aware of an increase in payment fraud related to a small number of bank cards being made at Nando’s. We are working closely with the card issuing bank to support affected customers. “We have robust security controls in place around customer accounts and payments. As with most online retailers, we apply further controls on a risk-assessed basis.

2/23/2022,"If the Russian tanks massed just a few dozen miles away begin moving right up to the Ukrainian border, Oleh Synehubov will receive a phone call, and immediately begin to implement a crisis plan. “There is a clear plan of action,” said Synehubov, the governor of Kharkiv region, in an interview on Monday at Kharkiv’s imposing, Stalin-era administration building.  He was speaking just an hour before Russian television aired footage of a Russian security council meeting, at which Vladimir Putin set in motion the recognition of separatist republics in east Ukraine and made thinly veiled threats of a major war against the rest of the country. Kharkiv, a largely Russian-speaking city of nearly 1.5 million inhabitants, sits just 20 miles away from the border with Russia, and is seen as one of the main possible targets for Putin. Back in 2014, the initial Kremlin plan after the Maidan protests in Kyiv – quickly abandoned as unrealistic – was to make Kharkiv the capital of an east Ukrainian state. Now, in Belgorod region, just the other side of the border, TikTok videos and satellite imagery show Russian armoured vehicles and troops moving ever closer to Ukraine. At the first sign of “anomalous” activity at the border, said Synehubov, an operation will be launched to warn local people of an impending Russian attack. “There will be television, radio and internet announcements, messages to mobile phones, sirens will sound, patrol cars and fire engines will go through the city with loudspeakers to tell people what to do,” he said. Special measures would be taken at military sites and other strategic locations, and efforts would be made to evacuate places such as care homes and schools. The exact plan, whether the orders to people were to find the nearest bomb shelter, or whether an evacuation would be instigated, would depend on the kind of invasion, he said. “If it’s an artillery attack, then it’s clear everyone has to go to bomb shelters, if it’s a full-scale invasion then we are already in a zone of military action and there would be an evacuation.” Synehubov said he hoped the plan would never be put into action, noting that the regional government is attempting to carry on as normal, with the local parliament sitting on Thursday to determine the budget. But Monday’s security council meeting, followed by Putin’s angry speech, appeared to make the prospect of war come a little more sharply into focus. On Tuesday Putin said that Russia will support the territorial claims of its proxy states in east Ukraine, two-thirds of which is currently controlled by Kyiv. This scenario brings into play towns like Mariupol, Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, where in 2014 local separatists and their Russian backers briefly seized control, but were later won back by Kyiv. Slovyansk and Kramatorsk, two towns north of Donetsk, were among the first places to be captured by groups of angry local people, coordinated by shady Russian operatives, back in the late spring of 2014. Now, they are proudly Ukrainian towns, filled with yellow-blue flags. In Mariupol, where there were pitched battles in the streets during May 2014 between separatist supporters and Ukrainian forces, oligarch Rinat Akhmetov and others have poured money in, to rejuvenate the Soviet feel of the industrial town. In other places, though, life is still tough, and exacerbated by conflict. Many of the young people have left: fleeing for a safer and better life either in Russia or in other parts of Ukraine. Places like Zolote, on the Ukrainian side of the frontline, feel like ghost towns, characterised by empty, decaying apartment blocks, muddy roads and a sense of despair, while the nights are frequently punctuated with the sound of artillery. “Ukraine needs to do a lot more to show people we are serious about providing opportunities for them,” said Iryna Vereschuk, the deputy prime minister in charge of reintegrating the separatist territories. Under the surface, there are still some people, particularly among older generations, who say they would welcome a Russian takeover. “I don’t think many people have changed their minds since 2014, I think it’s just buried deep under the surface. If the Russians came, many people would greet them with flowers,” said one 52-year-old resident of Kramatorsk, who did not want to be named. But the percentages have changed: some of those who backed separatists in 2014 later left for Russia, while others changed their minds after seeing the miserable existence in the separatist republics over recent years. Oleksiy Vukolov, a Ukrainian army commander responsible for the front in Luhansk region, estimated about 30% of the local population on the Ukrainian side of the lines had “separatist feelings in their heads”, he said. The one thing that everyone agrees on is that nobody in the region has a desire for further conflict. Putin, at the same time as he promises to “defend” these people, is promising just that. If Russian forces move against Mariupol, Kramatorsk and other Donbas towns, it could be the pretext for Putin to launch a major war against Kharkiv, Odessa and perhaps even the capital of Ukraine, Kyiv. There, local leaders are adamant that the city, with a large student population, would strongly resist a Russian invasion. Outside Synehubov’s office, a Ukraine flag is mounted on the wall in a glass case: it was saved from the building in 2014 when it was briefly seized by separatists. It later went on a tour of the frontline and now hangs proudly on display. Even though many people in Kharkiv would like to see Ukraine and Russia have good relations, Synehubov said opinions have changed drastically since 2014. “Back then, in Kharkiv people didn’t understand what was happening in Kyiv, what was happening in Donbas, and the Russians were waging a very big information war. Now, there is a unified opinion that Kharkiv is a Ukrainian city and it’s part of Ukraine. The things that happened in Crimea, in Donbas, it just can’t happen here.”",News/World news,‘There is a clear plan of action’: east Ukraine readies for invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/there-is-a-clear-plan-of-action-east-ukraine-readies-for-invasion
2/23/2022,"Subversive, liberating, violent, transgressive and revolutionary, surrealism was always more than a parade of melting watches and trains chuffing out of fireplaces. It was also more than a European phenomenon. For a movement that officially began in Paris in 1924, with the publication of the first Manifesto of Surrealism, its ideas travelled around the world remarkably quickly to Osaka and Bogotá, Mexico and Manila, to Cairo and to Greenwich Village. Co-produced by Tate Modern and the Metropolitan Museum in New York, Surrealism Beyond Borders is filled with unlikely conjunctions and unsettling objects, Freudian dreamworlds, nightmares and fantasies. So surreal, so predictable. Where this exhibition – and its enormous catalogue – differs from previous surveys is in showing how expansive, sprawling and diverse a movement surrealism was, and how, emerging in the aftermath of the first world war, its influence continued through the century, in art produced in postwar Japan and Korea, in the black power movement and the protests at the 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention, and in the May 1968 protests and strikes in France.  With its substitutions, its impossible juxtapositions, collisions and surprises, surrealism is with us still. What began as an avant garde movement (how quaint the term now sounds) has now become ubiquitous. The compendious, fascinating catalogue takes us from the Bureau of Surrealist Research in Paris to Sufism and surrealism in Turkey, and from surrealism in Brazil to the Philippines. Along the way we meet jazz musicians and poets, Leon Trotsky and a Vodou priest, surrealism’s fellow-travellers and oddball loners, feminists and revolutionaries, visionaries and misogynists. Sean O’Hagan writes in the catalogue of “a multifarious, polyphonic surrealism … a shifting, transnational assemblage from its very origins”, which is exactly what this exhibition presents. The rooms are filled with individual and group projects, and unlikely meetings and juxtapositions that are almost surreal in themselves. Ted Joans, jazz trumpeter, poet, painter and black power activist said that “jazz is my religion and surrealism my point of view”. Joans knew everyone, and first met André Breton at a bus stop in Paris in 1960. Joans’s Long Distance, an “exquisite corpse” drawing, produced over 30 years and involving 132 participants on three continents in its creation, concertinas its way along a wall for over 30ft. Among its contributors were writers John Ashbery, Michel Leiris and William Burroughs, artists Dorothea Tanning, David Hammons, Bruce Conner and a host of others. Spidery, sexy, automatist, this rambling collective drawing in which each of the file-card sized folds, produced by a different contributor, is a spontaneous compound trace of a kind of group unconscious. For a while, Joans shared an apartment with Charlie Parker, and commemorated him in Bird Lives, a 1958 painted black silhouette, seen from behind, hunched over his alto sax. In a film, we see Jones with sax player Archie Shepp, performing with Tuareg musicians at a Pan-African cultural festival in 1969. Other films here include New Zealand experimental film-maker Len Lye’s 1929 hand-drawn animation using Oceanic abstract motifs (it looks as fresh as the day it was made) and the great Czech animator and film-maker Jan Švankmajer’s 1968 stop-motion and live action Byt, which follows a terrified man racketing around his small Prague flat, which seems to conspire against him in various violent and absurd ways. That year saw the Prague Spring, and its suppression by invading Soviet troops. Filled with objects and drawings, photographs, films and much besides, almost everywhere you look there are terrible and alarming paintings, biomorphs with bristly spiky bits, droopy testicular ovoids, monuments in spooky deserted piazzas, disassembled bodies, Enrico Baj’s monstrous Body Snatcher terrorising a kitsch Swiss landscape, Yves Tanguy’s unctuous, slithery hinterlands. Along the way more familiar works remind us of the wearily familiar surrealist canon – Salvador Dalí’s telephone with a lobster for a hand-piece and Magritte’s locomotive in the fireplace, Picasso’s Three Dancers (to my mind, barely a surrealist painting at all) and a smudgy Arshile Gorky painting, whose presence here feels redundant. Reduced to a black, draped unrecognisable presence, the British-born surrealist Leonora Carrington stands among draped furniture and beside a lit candle in a room in Mexico City in 1962, photographed by Hungarian artist Kati Horna. Horna also partly inspired her friend Remedios Varo’s autobiographical 1961 triptych which recalls Varo’s strict Catholic upbringing in Spain, the weaving of a mantle for the world by a group of female artisans, and a depiction of the artist leaving Spain for Mexico. The paintings (reunited for the first time in many years) have the feel of a feminist, medievalist fairytale. The shadow of a crucifix falls across a city square in which a gigantic woman’s head stares in two directions at once, in a painting by Philippine artist Hernando R Ocampo. Painted in 1939, Ocampo mixes Catholic symbolism with surrealist strangeness, while Haitian Hector Hyppolite, a third-generation Vodou priest and painter (who, for a long time, used chicken feathers for brushes), applies a rather different kind of syncretism, between Catholic and Vodou symbolism, in his paintings. In one, there are knives and axes, a sacred heart, playing cards and a figure wielding a sword. A different kind of violence is implied in Alberto Giacometti’s 1930-31 The Cage, which manages to be both a delicately crafted, lathed and carved wood construction and also an image of dismemberment. Japanese surrealist Koga Harue, whose 1929 The Sea includes a swimsuit-clad Gloria Swanson, a cut-away view of a submarine, an airship, shoals of tropical fish, squid and the odd passing gull. What fun this painting is. Using found printed images as source material, Koga repainted and amalgamated them into a vision of technological advancement and pleasure, painted with almost photorealist finesse. Although criticised in Japan at the time as failing to reflect the realities of modern society, Koga was doing precisely the opposite. If this was surrealism, it was also pop art before the term existed, in the same way that Joseph Cornell’s little boxes of movie star mementoes and highly personal trinkets straddle both surrealist and pop sensibilities. In Okanoue Toshiko’s 1953 photo-collage The Call, an elegant Japanese woman sits in a room, dwarfing her surroundings. She seems as disquieted as a Hitchcock heroine. Outside the room is a raging sea. Amid the waves, a wolf howls. I know how it felt. Full of discoveries, Surrealism Beyond Borders is a tremendous work of scholarship, bringing together so many artists, so many essayists, so many threads and tangents, but indigestible as an exhibition. We travel too far, too quickly, with too many borders to cross. Surrealism Beyond Borders is at Tate Modern, London, from 24 February to 29 August.",Arts/Art and design,Surrealism Beyond Borders review – A raging sea of glorious strangeness ,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/22/surrealism-beyond-borders-review-tate-modern-london-raging-sea-strangeness
