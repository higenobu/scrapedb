1/18/2022,"The mission to repair the undersea communications cable that connects Tonga with the rest of the world could take up to a fortnight, the cable operator has warned, due to risks that a subsequent volcanic eruption could endanger a repair ship. Thousands of families remained without word from loved ones across Tonga, four days after the massive eruption of the Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha’apai volcano sent tsunami waves across the archipelago, and blanketed islands in ash.  While some telephone networks within the country had been restored and Australia and New Zealand were assisting with satellite calls, communications remained limited, particularly with outer islands. Samiuela Fonua, the chairperson of the state-owned Tonga Cable Ltd which owns and operates the cable, said continuing volcanic activity was a risk to any repair ship, which would need to enter the Tongatapu waters close to the site of the eruption. “We are just going through our preparations for the repair operation to start possibly next week,” he told the Guardian. “With luck we can have our cable ready within the next two weeks. “The main concern now is with the volcanic activities because our cables are pretty much on the same zone.” Preliminary testing indicated a break in the 827km-long Tonga cable about 37km offshore of Tonga’s capital, Nuku’alofa. Another cut in a domestic cable was about 47km offshore. Tonga relies on the international cable – part of a network of 19 subsea cables that criss-cross the south Pacific – for its phone and internet connection with the rest of the world. With the cable severed, the country of 105,000 people is dependent on satellite communications, which were being hampered by a massive dust cloud caused by the volcano. The severed Tonga cable runs to Fiji, where it intersects with the trans-Pacific Southern Cross Cable, connecting Tonga to Australia, the US and the rest of the world. The fibre-optic cable sits on the seabed, running 827km at depths of up to 3,500 metres. The country’s domestic communications cable runs from the capital north to Pangai and Neiafu. The $32m Tonga cable, financed by the Asian Development Bank and World Bank, landed in Nuku’alofa in 2013, and carries speeds of 20 gigabits per second. On Sunday, following the Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha’apai eruption, connectivity with the Tonga cable was lost, and the cable went into ‘single-end feed’ mode, meaning it was being powered from the Fijian end, but not from Tonga. It was unclear initially whether this was because of a failed power source in Tonga or a break in the cable. Subsequent testing indicated a likely break offshore of Nuku’alofa, close to the site of the eruption. Repairs to the cable were expected to be carried out by the vessel CS Reliance, which was moored off the Papua New Guinea capital, Port Moresby, more than 4,000km away. The vessel would need to sail first for Samoa to collect equipment before heading to the site of the break. The company tasked with fixing #Tonga’s vital communication cable says it's “actively working with the customer” to mobilize the repair ship “while evaluating crew and ship safety in the affected area”. The ship is currently anchored in Port Moresby.

According to the Tongan government, 36 people live on Mango and 69 on Fonoi. Jenny Salesa, the New Zealand Labour party MP for Panmure-Ōtāhuhu, said she had spoken to a methodist minister in Ha’apai, who reported there had been no casualties on Ha’apai’s main island, Lifuka, but that communication lines were still down with the outer islands. “Just not knowing is actually really heartbreaking for a lot of our families – it’s good news from Ha’apai, that at least the main island has no casualties. But we’re still waiting to see the effect of the tsunami on those coastal areas,” Salesa said. “There are thousands of people … that live here and they are still waiting to hear whether their own family members are all right,” Salesa said. “We’re waiting very patiently and hoping – everything crossed – that not too many lives have been lost or washed out to sea.” Papatoetoe Tongan Methodist parish reverend Ikilifi Pope, founder of the Tongan Youth Trust, said many in New Zealand’s Tongan diaspora were still struggling to reach family members. “At the moment, it’s really hard to communicate with Tonga, but we’re still trying,” he said. “The Tongan community in New Zealand are really concerned about their families and relatives.” New Zealand telecommunications companies have offered free calls to Tongan mobiles and landlines, but connection is intermittent.",News/World news,Tonga could be cut off for weeks amid efforts to repair undersea communications cable,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/tonga-could-be-cut-off-for-weeks-amid-efforts-to-repair-undersea-communications-cable
1/18/2022,"Joss Whedon, Buffy creator and director of films including The Avengers and Justice League, has responded to multiple allegations of misconduct, denying claims from actors including Gal Gadot and Ray Fisher that he threatened and belittled them on set. In a lengthy interview with New York magazine, Whedon responded to the stream of allegations made against him, which began to gain momentum in 2020 when Fisher detailed his experiences on the set of Justice League. Whedon stepped in to direct the film after the departure of Zack Snyder.  Fisher described Whedon as “gross, abusive, unprofessional, and completely unacceptable” and claimed his behaviour was “enabled” by senior executives at Warner Brothers studio. He said he had been told by a source that Whedon had lightened his skin tone in the 2017 film, and criticised Whedon for cutting several actors of colour from the film in rewrites, including reducing his role as Cyborg. When he shared his feedback, Whedon told him: “It feels like I’m taking notes right now, and I don’t like taking notes from anybody – not even Robert Downey Jr.” Whedon denied Fisher’s account at the time, but gave no further statement. But speaking to New York magazine, Whedon said he had brightened the entire film in postproduction, not just Fisher’s skin tone, and that he had cut down Cyborg’s role because he felt Fisher was a bad actor. He claimed viewers at test screenings had reported that Cyborg was “the worst of all the characters in the film”. “We’re talking about a malevolent force,” Whedon said of Fisher in the interview. “We’re talking about a bad actor in both senses.” Fisher did not respond to New York’s request for comment, but wrote on Twitter: “Looks like Joss Whedon got to direct an endgame after all … Rather than address all of the lies and buffoonery today — I will be celebrating the legacy of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Tomorrow the work continues.” Looks like Joss Whedon got to direct an endgame after all…Rather than address all of the lies and buffoonery today—I will be celebrating the legacy of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.Tomorrow the work continues.#MLKDayA>E Gadot, who plays Wonder Woman in Justice League, had also claimed Whedon “threatened” her on set and said he would make her “career miserable” during disagreements. A witness told Hollywood Reporter: “Joss was bragging that he’s had it out with Gal. He told her he’s the writer and she’s going to shut up and say the lines and he can make her look incredibly stupid in this movie.” Whedon denied he had threatened Gadot to New York magazine, saying she had misunderstood him when he said she would have to tie him to a railroad track before he’d cut a scene she had requested he take out. “I don’t threaten people. Who does that? English is not her first language, and I tend to be annoyingly flowery in my speech,” Whedon said. In response, Gadot told New York: “I understood perfectly.” In 2020, Warner launched an internal investigation into the Justice League set and announced “remedial action” had been taken. HBO also dropped Whedon as showrunner of The Nevers, a series he created about women with supernatural powers. After Fisher’s claims in 2020, Charisma Carpenter, who played Cordelia on Buffy and the spin-off series Angel, alleged in social media posts that Whedon had a “history of being casually cruel”. She claimed he had called her “fat” to colleagues when she became pregnant while filming Angel, and asked her if she “was going to ‘keep it’”. “He proceeded to attack my character, mock my religious beliefs, accuse me of sabotaging the show, and then unceremoniously fired me the following season once I gave birth,” she wrote. Multiple Buffy actors including Sarah Michelle Gellar, James Marsters and Michelle Trachtenberg supported Carpenter’s account of a “toxic environment”. Whedon denied to New York he had ever called Carpenter fat, but admitted he “was not mannerly” to her, saying: “Most of my experiences with Charisma were delightful and charming. She struggled sometimes with her lines, but nobody could hit a punch line harder than her.” Of the Buffy set, he said: “I yelled, and sometimes you had to yell. This was a very young cast, and it was easy for everything to turn into a cocktail party.” Whedon also spoke about his affairs, which were first revealed in 2017 by his ex-wife, Kai Cole. Then, she called Whedon, famed for creating the feminist icon Buffy, a “hypocrite preaching feminist ideals” in an open letter to his fans about his behaviour towards women. On the matter of sleeping with multiple employees, journalists and fans while married, Whedon said he felt “fucking terrible about them”, but felt he “had” to have sexual relationships with women, especially beautiful and young women who he felt would have ignored him before he became famous, because he would “always regret it” if he hadn’t. He admitted he could be difficult to work with, but lamented that people had used “every weaponisable word of the modern era to make it seem like I was an abusive monster. I think I’m one of the nicer showrunners that’s ever been.”",Arts/Culture,‘I’m one of the nicer showrunners’: Joss Whedon denies misconduct allegations,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/18/im-one-of-the-nicer-showrunners-joss-whedon-denies-misconduct-allegations
