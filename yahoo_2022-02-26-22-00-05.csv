2/26/2022,"Liquor stores across the U.S. and Canada have started throwing out their stocks of Russian vodka in protest of President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, according to reports. In Ontario, Canada, Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy directed the provincial Liquor Control Board to have stores remove Russian vodka and other alcoholic products, according to the Canadian Press. ""Ontario joins Canada's allies in condemning the Russian government's act of aggression against the Ukrainian people and we strongly support the federal government's efforts to sanction the Russian government,"" Bethlenfalvy said. ""We will continue to be there for the Ukrainian people during this extremely difficult time."" RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES Products will be removed from nearly 700 stores across the province. ""Ontario and the LCBO can't say it's truly standing with Ukraine while continuing to be Putin’s customer,"" Steven Del Duca, leader of the Ontario Liberal Party, said. Elsewhere in Canada, stores in Manitoba, New Brunswick, British Columbia and Newfoundland were also taking similar action. The Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation removed Russian products from its shelves and website because of the ""terrible events taking place."" British Columbia was ceasing imports on Russian alcohol, Deputy Premier Mike Farnworth said. ""Our province stands with those who understand Europe's peace following two world wars depends on respecting international law,"" he told the Canadian Press. In the U.S., the Jacob Liquor Exchange in Wichita, Kansas, decided to remove its more than 100 bottles of Russian vodka from the shelves and poured some of it on the ground. ""I think the whole world knows by now that Russia’s at war with Ukraine for no apparent reason,"" Jamie Stratton, wine director and partner of the store, told KSNW-TV in Wichita. ""I guess this is our sanction … and this may be small, but every small thing makes a difference."" In Oregon, the owner of a bar in Bend filmed himself pouring out all of his Russian vodka, according to FOX 12 of Portland. ""Russia is acting as though it's 1939 and going into Europe with a full force that they have in the Ukraine,"" Bill McCormick, owner of Pine Tavern, told the station. ""I am so concerned about it metastasizing into other countries."" He said he stood to lose a few hundred dollars over the spilled vodka – but said the protest was worth it to him. Bob Quay, owner of Bob’s Bar in Grand Rapids, Michigan, told MLive.com he pulled several bottles off his shelf as a ""protest against the aggression."" ""I just made the decision on the spot,"" he told MLive.com.

2/26/2022,"President Biden's nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson immediately elicited disappointment from the two Republican senators from South Carolina, but not for the reasons you might expect. Both Sens. Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott said they would have preferred Biden rolled out a different, mostly liberal nominee from their home state, Judge Michelle Childs, whom they were inclined to support to become the first Black woman on the high court. It was a rare opportunity for bipartisanship that wouldn't have made much of a difference in terms of the ideological balance of the Supreme Court. Both Jackson and Childs are marginally more liberal than retiring Justice Stephen Breyer, though Jackson is probably the most liberal of the three. But not that liberal, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki effectively assured reporters at a briefing Friday. ""She's ruled in favor of Republicans and Democrats, she's ruled for and against the government, regardless of whether the government is led by a Democratic president or a Republican president,"" she said. ""Litigants, lawyers, and judges across the ideological spectrum appreciate her ability to be an impartial adjudicator, and that's exactly what you want … She's even clerked for three different federal judges who were appointed by presidents of different political parties."" An odd argument to make, given that Childs was so clearly bypassed to satiate a base mourning late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, still bitter about Senate Republicans blocking Merrick Garland, and basically wanting to take the fight to Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell. But Biden, not for the first time, has decided to bypass the bipartisanship that he promised to suburban voters who helped put him in the White House. Instead, he has tried to keep a commitment to the second set of voters he had to persuade — the most left-wing members of his party, who had not turned out in sufficient numbers in the battleground states in 2016, and who he enticed with promises to let Bernie Sanders turn him into the most progressive president since Franklin D. Roosevelt. It was always going to be difficult to be FDR 2.0 in an era of political polarization and a bipartisan dealmaker at the same time. Biden's appeal to one of these sets of voters was always likely to fall by the wayside. Except he has not had much success delivering for the left, either. Biden's biggest legislative accomplishment came the one time he did bypass the most liberal Democrats and go bipartisan: the $1.2 trillion infrastructure package he is so furiously traveling the country to sell even after its passage. Progressives didn't want to pass it before their own incredible shrinking reconciliation bill — first $10 trillion, then $6 trillion, then $3.5 trillion, then less than $2 trillion — for fear of being double-crossed by the GOP and moderate Democrats. Well, infrastructure week finally came, and Build Back Better is at best languishing in congressional purgatory and is most likely to land at its final destination alongside Hillary Clinton's 1994 health care bill and the last half-dozen unpassed comprehensive immigration reform measures. A 50-50 Senate where Biden needs the votes of the least liberal Democrats — including one representing Donald Trump's best state in the last two presidential elections — is not conducive to passing the entire progressive wishlist. The Democrats' House majority is barely bigger, though Speaker Nancy Pelosi has more control. With the midterm elections coming up in November, those razor-thin majorities may soon be deader than Build Back Better. Still, the Democrats have bet that they should ram through as much as they can while they still have their majorities. So even if Jackson and Childs would have voted the same way on abortion, affirmative action, guns, and any of the other dozen or so issues that prompt voters to care about Supreme Court nominations in the first place, going for the incrementally more liberal pick was ultimately deemed more important than getting a few extra Republican votes. Perhaps this time it will work. A handful of Republicans could still vote for Jackson, though it appears her confirmation process will be at least somewhat more difficult than Childs' would have been. Conservatives will continue to command a 6-3 majority, and Breyer won't be around to pry Chief Justice John Roberts loose from this bloc. But unlike with ObamaCare when Biden was vice president, it mostly hasn't worked. And those majorities from a dozen years ago were much bigger before they too were wiped out in a midterm election cycle. Liberals keep asking Biden to go big or go home, and he keeps heeding their advice to no obvious effect. This Supreme Court pick, however historic, could have been different — but wasn't.
