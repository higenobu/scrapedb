4/19/2022,"Cristiano Ronaldo has announced that his son has died during childbirth, with the Manchester United forward stating that only the birth of the child’s twin sister is providing he and partner Georgina Rodriguez with the strength “to live this moment”. The 37-year-old posted the news on Instagram on Monday evening. “It is with our deepest sadness that we have to announce that our baby boy has passed away,” the statement said. “It is the greatest pain that any parents can feel. Only the birth of our baby girl gives us the strength to live this moment with some hope and happiness. “We would like to thank the doctors and nurses for all their expert care and support. We are all devastated at this loss and we kindly ask for privacy at this very difficult time. Our baby boy, you are our angel. We will always love you.” In October Ronaldo stated he and Rodriguez were expecting twins, the Portuguese already having four children, two of which are twins. “Delighted to announce we are expecting twins,” a statement at the time said. “Our hearts are full of love - we can’t wait to meet you. Rodriguez has previously stated how loving a father Ronaldo is. “Every day by your side is happy and special,” she said on Instagram. “We love you indefinitely. Thank you so much to the best dad in the world.” Your pain is our pain, @Cristiano 💔Sending love and strength to you and the family at this time. https://t.co/24oyEV8CQi United travel to Anfield on Tuesday to play Liverpool in the Premier League. Whether the forward will feel ready to make himself available for the game remains unclear. Responding to Ronaldo’s news, United posted a message on Twitter. It read: “Your pain is our pain, @Cristiano Sending love and strength to you and the family at this time.” Ronaldo returned to United in August for a second spell having played for the club between from 2003 to 2009. He is United’s top scorer this season, with his hat-trick in Saturday’s 3-2 win over Norwich City taking his tally to 21 goals in all competitions. It was the 60th hat-trick of the Portuguese’s career, one that seen him score 807 goals in total and five times be named Fifa World Player of the Year and Ballon d’Or winner. Ronaldo has also won the Champions League on five occasions and claimed league titles with United, Real Madrid and Juventus.",Sport/Football,Cristiano Ronaldo and Georgina Rodríguez announce death of baby son,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/18/cristiano-ronaldo-and-georgina-rodriguez-announce-death-of-baby-son
4/19/2022,"If you were looking for a scene that neatly sums up Coachella, California’s festival double-weekender, it is this: every day in the late afternoon, under the giant ferris wheel, festivalgoers appear to move as if performing a choreographed routine, tilting their faces and tensing their butt-cheeks into their smartphones in slo-motion. At first it looks as if you might be in a flashmob, but suddenly the penny drops: ah, this is golden hour, and Coachella is sometimes as much about finding the perfect selfie light as it is musical acts. It’s an image that’s become synonymous with the enormous two-weekend event – where fashion is more feted than the program itself – but it’s also, in some ways, a misleading one. Peel back the layer-cake of posers, ignore the giant VIP section that segregates the event between the plebeians and what one passerby calls “Los Angeles privilege”, ie those who can afford a special wristband for the nice views, loos and bars – and squint beyond the big-hitters. Underneath, the event is an endless trove of exceptional global artists and future megastars, from Japan’s Harajuku queen Kyary Pamyu Pamyu and Belgian triple-threat Stromae to Jamaica’s Koffee, Australian rapper Sampa The Great and Palestinian techno DJ Sama Abdulhadi. And sure, while there’s a fairly large stable of forgettables whose TikTok numbers are the only notable thing about them (and some of whom clearly aren’t ready to perform to large crowds), the lineup is actually more varied than you might think. Soon, the specific-to-festivals stress of racing around trying to catch everybody, after years of live event drought, comes rushing back. From the top down, though, it’s been a peculiar year for the lack of heritage acts. Or even ones who have put out more than two albums. Both Harry Styles on Friday and Billie Eilish on Saturday turf out bombastic shows but neither have the discography that is the stuff of true festival legend (though they do both bring out more seasoned guests: Shania Twain and Damon Albarn, respectively). Sunday’s headliner, Kanye West, pulled out and was replaced by a totally new team-up between The Weeknd and returning EDM trio, Swedish House Mafia. But that’s not to say that Coachella was short on major artists making their marks: Megan Thee Stallion delivered an absolutely blinding Tron-styled hip-pop confection on Saturday, all shimmering bodysuits, booty anthems for “hot girls and boys” and bass you could almost certainly hear from within the mainframe. On Friday night, Phoebe Bridgers graduated to second from headline act, on the second-biggest outdoor stage, with her gothic pop-up book set; despite her musical bummers (her songs are quite sad) it won’t be long before she’s in pole position. Anyone who was not sure that UK rap could properly cross over to the US, meanwhile, need have only dropped by (Santan) Dave’s show, as he shouted out Shoreditch within the first two minutes to a dedicated crowd, iPhones raised (and hoping for a Drake cameo). Finneas stepped out from under his sister’s shadow on Sunday with his own solo masterstroke; while a nearby Orville Peck – resplendent in gold leather and fringed Batman mask – delivered a moving set of brooding, bartioned Americana, made all the more bizarre due to trance DJ Tiesto watching in the audience (you do wonder too whether Styles stole Peck’s thunder by bringing out Twain, who appears on Peck’s song Legends Never Die). It’s always fun to see artists trying to outdo each other, especially when it comes to who they can convince to get on a golf cart round the backstage buggy circuit and join them onstage. Styles aside, on Friday night, Canadian future-soul dude Daniel Caesar brought out a shirtless Justin Bieber to perform their song Peaches. Snoop Dogg helped Brazilian pop star Anitta open her main stage set. Beastie Boys keysman Money Mark joined Britain’s favorite party band Hot Chip for their now legendary cover of Sabotage. And the US-based collective 88Rising, who are dedicated to amplifying Asian culture (of which, excellently, there was much more at Coachella this year) presented an exhilarating pile-up of stars from Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and Japan, including J-popper Hikaru Utada and reunited girl group 2NE1. And the aforementioned Dave recreated his viral “Alex from Glasto” moment by bringing up Spike from London to take over the AJ Tracey part on their track Thiago Silva. (He did a brilliant job). Beyond the ever-important issues of inclusion and diversity, however, you might not have remembered that there’s a war still raging on the other side of the world, unless you’d briefly glimpsed the colours of the Ukrainian flag on the screen behind Styles, or caught Arcade Fire’s surprise set. The Canadian band debuted a darker, leather-clad synth show that pulled both from AllSaints look books and 80s electronic goths Depeche Mode, and dedicated The Suburbs to Ukrainian punk rockers. It was an emotional performance, especially when frontman Win Butler dedicated his rousing new song Unconditional I (Lookout Kid) from forthcoming album WE to his son, and then restarted it, adding that it’s been a difficult year. Suddenly, smiley-faced inflatables ping up giddily across the stage and the audience looks on with something in their eyes. Indeed, Coachella 2022 provided a dusty oasis away from reality, with Covid-19 restrictions lifted. Masks, proof of vaccination or negative results were not required to enter. The festival’s health and safety rules further added that there is “no guarantee, express or implied, that those attending the festival will not be exposed to Covid-19”, so it’s a little odd that there were only two sites offering rapid antigen tests, tucked away as they were and not marked out clearly on the app’s map. Despite following “local guidelines”, it’s a large-scale blind eye that puts the responsibility on the festivalgoers, though it was a risk they were willing to take. Many kept their masks on in the baking desert heat, but even in spaces like the covered nightclub-like tents and the overcrowded VIP areas, most paid no caution to the wind. The people want hedonism and abandon. So it makes sense then that dance music producers like Australian beatsmith Flume, and the UK’s Disclosure, Jamie XX and – a clean-cut young guy who seems to have become immediately massive – Fred Again, were among the big draws this year, as was seasoned raver Fatboy Slim. The glowsticks were out in force for Swedish House Mafia too, who delivered a blinding, sometimes harrowing set of EDM, hip-hop, shadowy techno and Daft Punkisms, complementing The Weeknd’s electro noir. With a notable lack of heavyweight guitar bands this year, or once in a lifetime reunions, the heaviest moments of the weekend came, brilliantly, from more unlikely places. There was 68-year-old composer-turned-rock frontman Danny Elfman’s batshit set of his film music, veering from his The Nightmare Before Christmas to The Simpsons themes, to his soundtrack for Edward Scissorhands as he sang, topless, with a live band (featuring Limp Bizkit’s Wes Borland!) and deranged visuals to match. Or there’s Doja Cat, who at times could give Metallica a run for their money in the shredding stakes, and whose set was a shining example of how genre is irrelevant in contemporary music. Some things never change, though, and the spirit-crushing queues for a cab home, or to get out of the car park at the end of the night, were all you needed to bring you crashing back down to earth. You swear you’ll never do it again – until next year, that is. Or how about next weekend?",Arts/Music,"Coachella: high-energy hedonism, surprise stars and Covid concerns",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/18/coachella-high-energy-hedonism-surprise-stars-and-covid-concerns
4/19/2022,"Tony Blair will call for a dramatic increase in the proportion of young people progressing into higher education (HE) over the next two decades to tackle the country’s productivity crisis. In a report due to be published later this week, the former prime minister will recommend that by 2040 as many as 70% of young people should go into HE, potentially increasing economic growth by nearly 5% over the next generation. Blair’s proposal, which builds on the 50% target he set when in government, is a challenge to the current administration, which – the report notes – appears “increasingly sceptical” about the value of HE. “Far from reaching ‘peak grad’, as some in government argue, we will need many more workers with abilities acquired in HE settings,” the report will say. “We must therefore embark on a multi-parliament drive to raise educational attainment substantially with an eye on the skills our workforce will need not today, but in 20 or 30 years’ time.” Under Blair’s proposal, the aim should be for the proportion going on to HE to increase to 60% by 2030 and 70% by 2040 in line with other high-innovation economies around the world. The target refers to under 30s who progress into higher education, rather than just school leavers going to university. Universities are higher education providers, but higher education is also provided in other institutions including further education colleges. The plans have the backing of Jo Johnson, former higher education minister and brother of the prime minister. Writing in the foreword to the report, which was reported in the Times on Monday and is being published by Tony Blair Institute, he said: “We still don’t have enough highly skilled individuals to fill many vacancies today.” Lord Johnson added: “As we continue to mature as a knowledge economy, more jobs will be generated in sectors that disproportionately employ graduates. High-innovation economies, like South Korea, Japan and Canada, understand this and have boosted higher education; participation rates in these countries are already between 60% and 70%. We cannot afford for policy to remain steeped solely in today’s challenges and our ambition should be to join them.” The government is considering reintroducing student number controls in England, potentially linked to graduate earnings, as well as creating minimum entry requirements for university courses. Blair’s report will warn, however, that squeezing HE participation “will leave Britons unprepared for the economy of the future”. In 1999 Blair made a pledge for 50% of young adults to go into HE “in the next century”. That target was on track in 2017, when half of young people were likely to participate in HE for the first time by the age of 30, with Blair’s target including those studying for vocational qualifications such as higher diplomas. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, welcomed the former prime minister’s intervention. “I think Tony Blair is correct on this. We’ve already hit his old 50% target and we should clearly now go further, given we remain behind other countries and employers are crying out for highly skilled people.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Our universities have an important role to play in our education system, but this route is not always in the best interests of the individual or nation. “The Education Secretary has been clear about his vision for a high-quality skills system that meets the needs of employers and our economy, while ensuring we have high quality vocational and technical options that are just as prestigious and rewarding as academic routes.”",News/Education,Tony Blair calls for drastic increase of young people in higher education,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/18/tony-blair-calls-for-drastic-increase-of-young-people-in-higher-education
4/19/2022,"When Boris Johnson takes to the dispatch box on Tuesday, for the first time in weeks, his allies will roar their support – an attempt to immediately dispel any questions about confidence in his leadership. While the prime minister might appear at times contrite for breaking Covid laws during England’s first Covid lockdown, he is expected to maintain that at the time he did not believe he was doing anything wrong. This defence is key to ensuring he cannot be found to have knowingly misled parliament when he proclaimed that no rules were broken in No 10, when stories of sloshed staff holding parties with suitcases full of wine and a DJ first emerged. It is the “knowingly” that is most important. Johnson will seek to brush the issue under the carpet, bat off calls to resign and urge MPs to focus on issues such as the war in Ukraine. He will inevitably be thrown lifelines by some supportive backbenchers. The matter will, inevitably, drag on. On top of the ongoing Met police investigation and Sue Gray’s as-yet-unpublished report, opposition parties are also mounting an attempt to keep the spotlight on Johnson’s rule-breaking. They are pushing for the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, to allow a vote on a debate about whether the prime minister should be held in contempt of parliament, potentially launching an investigation by the privileges committee into whether the Commons was misled. This is a dangerous area for Johnson because the ministerial code that bears his signature is crystal clear that the price for misleading parliament is resignation. While the text of any final motion has yet to materialise – and Hoyle will not deliver his ruling on whether to accept it or not until Tuesday at the earliest – Tory insiders admit the issue would be treated like a confidence vote. But any vote will almost certainly be whipped, meaning the plan is doomed to fail even if it goes to a vote thanks to Johnson’s huge majority – barring a mammoth backbench rebellion. One MP said they were considering voting against the government but knew that if they did so, they would be stripped of the whip and that would be the end of their political career. “We have a reputation for being ruthless and brutal, which isn’t being lived up to at the moment,” they said. There are those on the government’s side who also believe the move is premature, and that maximum damage would in fact be inflicted if the issue was left hanging unresolved in the run-up to next month’s local elections to inflict maximum damage. Opposition parties are also sceptical about the chances of any investigation being able to use any evidence to prove Johnson misled parliament. “It’s not clear how we’d show that intent was incontrovertible,” a source said. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats are still keen to force the vote given the awkward timing for the Conservatives, with midterm local elections less than a month away. Online adverts are being worked up to target voters in key areas where Tory MPs who may not want to offer Johnson their public support will be forced to back him. While the government will certainly still win, it is another uneasy echo for some Tories of the downfall of Theresa May, whose administration was found in contempt of parliament less than four years ago.",News/Politics,Partygate: Boris Johnson will hide behind ‘unknowingly’ defence ,https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/apr/18/partygate-boris-johnson-will-hide-behind-unknowingly-defence
4/19/2022,"In between England’s ruinous Ashes campaign and the largely dismal epilogue in the Caribbean last month, a panel of Rob Key, Mike Atherton and Nasser Hussain recorded a podcast for Sky in which they analysed the Test team’s myriad problems and discussed how they would change things. Key, though supposedly steering the debate as host, was pressed for his views. After detailed responses that have been widely reported over the past few days and which included his belief that player power needs addressing, Atherton joked the only solution was to take charge of the England set-up himself. “The answer to that is no,” Key replied, amid chuckles from all three. Fast forward a couple of months and, a bit like the old Bob Monkhouse joke about the first time he told people he wanted to be a comedian, they’re not laughing now. Key starts at the England and Wales Cricket Board on Tuesday as its new managing director of men’s cricket, having bounced from playing career to commentary box to one of the most influential positions in the sport. On the face of it this is a remarkable rise and in some quarters – including Mark Ramprakash – viewed as possibly being a case of jobs for the boys. Certainly Key’s direct experience of sports administration is as thin as the field of candidates from which he emerged, such that the ECB comms team even cited his (admittedly always thought-provoking) Evening Standard column in Easter Sunday’s lunch-ruining announcement in a bid to flesh it out a touch. But then there is a case to say that rather than Key’s lack of hours spent throwing to players in the nets, negotiating county contracts or arguing with groundsmen about the height of the mower blades being a hindrance, his time out of – or at least adjacent to – the English system is a strength. His cricketing knowledge is rich from a lifetime in the sport, even if his Test career was largely unfulfilled, and his captaincy of Kent oversaw all facets of the club. He should be able to not just bring fresh ideas, but also scrutinise decision-making all the way down the food chain without an in-built “well, this is how we’ve always done it” mentality. Key also has an important character trait for a role which will hinge greatly on his relationships both within English cricket and overseas: he is a people person but not a people pleaser. Some may think of him as Andrew Flintoff’s old drinking buddy and then the cherry-cheeked butt of the jokes in the Sky box, such as the time they sent him up the rock climbing wall at the Ageas Bowl. And it’s true, he is amusing company and someone who gets on with people from all walks of life. But on the subject of cricket he doesn’t muck about, with his opinions always considered but forthright, and disagreement something he does not avoid just to keep the peace. It is also interesting to hear the jump from cricket commentary to top level administration being questioned by some when Andrew Strauss, managing director from 2015 to 2019 and someone who emerged mainly in credit, made the exact same move. Unless Test captaincy secretly teaches someone how to oversee pathways and manage budgets, perhaps Key’s estuary accent is the difference. Certainly his aversion to corporate speak, at a time when English cricket is utterly infected with it, should be welcomed. And for another example of how the leap from broadcasting to management can be overcome, look at Ravi Shastri, who swapped describing “tracer bullets” on air to heading up India’s coaching staff without any direct experience after his playing days. Delegating much of the day-to-day coaching work to others, Shastri challenged every area of the set-up, bullishly talked up the goal of winning overseas – something which was not always the case previously – and set the tone and tactics for what became a great team. Their fast bowling in particular, under his right-hand man, Bharat Arun, was revolutionised during this period. It would also be very English to spend years bemoaning the loss of Hussain and Atherton to the running of the sport and then turn noses up at Key, someone whose reading of the game is admired by the two former captains, for putting the microphone down and placing his head on the block. The 42-year-old probably had a job for life at Sky and, as he joked when the ECB’s initial approach became public last month, a lot more time to spend on the golf course. As it is, he has taken a bold decision to grasp the tiller of a ship that is listing right now. And it is a huge tanker to turn around. The white-ball teams may be well-drilled under Eoin Morgan with an over-supply of players but the Test side – fifth in the rankings and bottom of the World Test Championship – will need careful husbandry beyond simply appointing a new captain and head coach. The battle over the future of the domestic game, under review by the ECB, could get spiky. As such, Key will require strong lieutenants, possibly some initial assistance with the unfamiliar elements of the role, a bit of luck and maybe a thick skin. There are no guarantees but to say he is not qualified would be underestimating him.",Sport/Sport,Rob Key’s remarkable rise is not just a case of a job for the boys | Ali Martin,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/18/rob-keys-remarkable-rise-is-not-just-a-case-of-a-job-for-the-boys
4/19/2022,"Tory MPs are considering the aftermath of dire local election results as their next chance to oust Boris Johnson, with the prime minister preparing to apologise for his Partygate penalty. However, Downing Street is feeling bullish that Johnson has “crossed the Rubicon” after receiving his first fixed-penalty notice earlier this month, and will cling on in the face of further charges. Johnson will face a challenging day on Tuesday, forced to deny misleading the Commons over his knowledge of illegal gatherings in No 10 by clarifying his previous insistence that no Covid rules were broken. Even his most stout defenders are feeling as if their loyalty has been unreciprocated, with one saying they have been greeted with a “slap in the face”. “All I’ve got to show for it is a Boris-shaped slap mark on my cheek,” they added. In his first statement to parliament since being handed the penalty, the prime minister is expected to urge Conservative MPs to focus on “the huge priorities we need to deliver for people”, before privately addressing the entire parliamentary Tory party later that evening. Opposition parties are pushing for the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, to grant MPs a vote on whether Johnson should be found in contempt of parliament, or face an investigation by the privileges committee. They believe the fines imposed by police for multiple events during lockdown in Downing Street show the prime minister misled the Commons when he said in December that “all guidance was followed completely in No 10”. While few Tories have publicly criticised Johnson since he and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, were fined by police, some voiced concern that the prime minister would not be contrite enough in his statement on Tuesday. “I’d fine him again, because he hasn’t learned his lesson,” one raged. Another accused him of “arrogance”. It has been suggested Johnson would cite an exemption from the strict Covid rules, saying he was in his place of work and “going to events in a work capacity”. Most of those vying to oust the prime minister have turned their sights to next month, when they believe more fines may have been issued and a poor set of local election results would show the damaging effect Partygate is having on the Conservatives’ popularity. “Nothing will happen until after the May elections, which could be terrible,” a senior MP said. Another added: “I don’t think this week will be a problem. But I suspect the bigger challenges are still to come. The PM being fined multiple times will be very bad, but by far the biggest issue is the sense that the government is now tiring and disjointed. That’s what is making me nervous.” A third predicted: “The spell over colleagues might be broken when their councillors start losing in May and when the Wakefield byelection goes badly.” Some of those who went public with their calls for Johnson to quit in January have warned colleagues against following suit, saying privately that their mental health has been badly affected given the pushback and isolation they faced. Those considering submitting a letter of no confidence therefore said they wanted to wait for the right moment. “I’m not going to take the shot unless I’m confident I can take him down,” one said. Another confessed: “This unhappy Easter bunny’s keeping his powder dry.” A third sceptical MP said Johnson would “try the business as usual stance”, but cautioned: “There is public confidence but private concern about his future being expressed by lots of people.” The elections expert and Conservative peer Robert Hayward said a poor performance at the polls next month coinciding with further penalties “could trigger the whole process from January again”. But he added that if the party exceeded expectations and the war in Ukraine continued to dominate, then “there is every prospect that the results will not be clear and may not trigger anything”. Johnson’s allies were confident he would survive the fallout from receiving his first penalty notice relatively unscathed. One minister accused the Metropolitan police of “grossly overreacting” for issuing penalties to those who attended a gathering in Downing Street during the first lockdown where Johnson was wished happy birthday. They said: “Midterm local elections at a 25-30% turnout are normally 0% useful at predicting the next general election result – but will no doubt be used as a tool for bedwetting by the usual suspects.” Another supportive MP said the first fine was over a relatively minor gathering. They said it “will help dilute the grief if more serious breaches are uncovered” – meaning “people will just shrug”. A Downing Street insider also expressed confidence Johnson had “crossed the Rubicon” and said if he survived being fined once, he would probably cling on even if the police found further Covid law breaches were committed. Sunak also receiving a penalty charge and coming under fire over his previously undisclosed holding of a US green card have been viewed by Johnson’s supporters as helpful at neutralising one of his most dangerous rivals. The war in Ukraine could continue to dominate in the aftermath of the 5 May local elections. Officers from Scotland Yard are still considering evidence about other alleged law-breaking parties. Government sources told the Guardian last week there were three further events that Johnson attended for which he could be: the May 2020 “bring your own booze” summer party; a November gathering in Johnson’s flat with his wife on the day of Dominic Cummings’ departure; and a leaving do for the senior aide Lee Cain in No 10 the following day.",News/Politics,Tory plotters eye local elections as next chance to oust Boris Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/18/tory-plotters-local-elections-next-chance-oust-boris-johnson
