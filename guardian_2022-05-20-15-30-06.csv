5/20/2022,"Robbie McEwen, the former cyclist and now commentator, has apologised for using a homophobic slur during a broadcast of stage 10 of the Giro d’Italia. The three-time Tour de France points classification winner, who retired from professional cycling in 2012, said he “unintentionally” used the phrase during commentary on Eurosport and GCN+ earlier this week. “I unintentionally used an offensive phrase during my commentary on stage 10, and I regret both saying it and not immediately apologising on air,” McEwen tweeted. “I’m genuinely sorry for the language I used, and for letting the team down, but mostly I want to say sorry to anyone who I offended.” McEwen, who in his heyday was classed as one of the sport’s fastest sprinters, was discussing his lunch with co-commentator Rob Hatch during the broadcast of Wednesday’s stage when Hatch shared how he had bought some fudge on his way back from his break, only to have eaten it already. I unintentionally used an offensive phrase during my commentary on Stage 10, and I regret both saying it and not immediately apologising on air. I’m genuinely sorry for the language I used, and for letting the team down, but mostly I want to say sorry to anyone who I offended. McEwen responded: “You’ve gone in the fudge shop and you’ve consumed it straight away. The fudge packers were wasting their time.” “Fudge packer” is a derogatory term for a homosexual male. McEwen apologised 48 hours later after several posts on social media highlighted the use of the slur. Global Cycling Network, which provides coverage of the Italian grand tour for Eurosport, also apologised on Thursday and said the commentary had been removed from its highlights show. “Cycling is a sport for all and everyone should feel welcome. We chose not to publish stage 10 coverage until an offensive phrase was removed and we apologise to anyone offended during the broadcast,” GCN said in a tweet. “The full stage will soon be available in English without this section of commentary.” Cycling is a sport for all & everyone should feel welcome. We chose not to publish Stage 10 coverage until an offensive phrase was removed & we apologise to anyone offended during the broadcast. The full stage will soon be available in English without this section of commentary. McEwen took part in 12 Tours de France, winning the points classification three times between 2002 and 2006 and 12 stages. He also claimed 12 individual stage wins on the Giro d’Italia and is regarded as one of Australia’s greatest cyclists. Since retirement he has been a fixture of cycling coverage on TV. Earlier this year, he was released from his role with the Australian broadcaster SBS, with the network saying it would take a “different approach” to their commentary. “Robbie has been a valued member of our cycling commentary lineup for a number of events over the last six years,” a spokesperson said at the time. “But we’re exploring a different approach in 2022. While his contract has come to an end, we thank Robbie for all that he’s brought to the role during his time with us.”",Sport/Sport,Robbie McEwen apologises for using ‘offensive phrase’ during Giro d’Italia broadcast,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/20/robbie-mcewen-apologises-for-using-offensive-phrase-during-giro-ditalia-broadcast
5/20/2022,"The Hungarian leader, Viktor Orbán, has told a conference of US conservatives that the path to power required having their own media outlets, calling for shows like Tucker Carlson’s to be broadcast “24/7”. Orbán, recently elected to a fourth term, laid out a 12-point blueprint to achieving and consolidating power to a special meeting of the US Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), under the slogan of “God, Homeland, Family”, held in Budapest. The Hungarian prime minister said that with his fourth electoral victory on 3 April, Hungary had been “completely healed” of “progressive dominance”. He suggested it was time for the right to join forces. “We have to take back the institutions in Washington and Brussels. We must find allies in one another and coordinate the movements of our troops,” Orbán said. He told Republicans in the Balnaconference centre on the banks of the Danube that media influence was one of the keys to success. In Hungary, the prime minister and his allies have effective control of most media outlets in Hungary, including state TV. “Have your own media. It’s the only way to point out the insanity of the progressive left,” he said. “The problem is that the western media is adjusted to the leftist viewpoint. Those who taught reporters in universities already had progressive leftist principles.” He portrayed the US media as being dominated by Democrats, who he claimed were being “served” by CNN, the New York Times and others. “Of course, the GOP has its media allies but they can’t compete with the mainstream liberal media. My friend, Tucker Carlson is the only one who puts himself out there,” he said. “His show is the most popular. What does it mean? It means programs like his should be broadcasted day and night. Or as you say 24/7.” Carlson had been billed as a key speaker at the CPAC conference, but the Fox News talk show host sent only a 38 second video message, in which he extolled Hungary under the Orbán government as a model for the US. “I can’t believe that you’re in Budapest and I am not,” he said. “What a wonderful country. And you know why you can tell it’s a wonderful country? Because the people who turned our country into a much less good place are hysterical when you point it out.” “The last thing they want is any kind of signpost to a better way, and Hungary certainly provides that,” Carlson added. “A free and decent and beautiful country that cares about its people, their families, and the physical landscape.” Journalists from international media outlets were denied access to the event, including the New Yorker, Vox Media, Vice News, Rolling Stone, and the Associated Press, despite months of requests. The organizers either ignored their requests for accreditation or told them to “watch the event online”. Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union that runs CPAC, said the Central-European country is the right place to start a conversation about Europe. Orbán’s 12-point action plan also included points on faith, “because the absence of faith is dangerous” and the importance in countering “LGBT-propaganda” which was “still new in our country but we have already destroyed it”. The second day of the CPAC conference on Friday is billed to start with a “surprise video message” that some speculate will be from Donald Trump, who was also invited to the event. The schedule also features Candace Owens, described as “Trump’s favorite influencer’, video messages from Mark Meadows, Trump’s former White House chief of staff, Santiago Abascal, president of Spain’s Vox party, and Zsolt Bayer, a pro-Orbán pundit who formerly called Roma people “animals”, referred to Jewish people as “stinking excrement” and used racist slurs for Black people during the BLM protests. Marine Le Pen, the presidential candidate from the French far right National Rally, was announced as a speaker on Monday, but the post disappeared from the organizers’ Facebook after a couple of hours, and her name was deleted from CPAC Hungary’s website.",News/US news,Viktor Orbán tells CPAC the path to power is to ‘have your own media’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/20/viktor-orban-cpac-republicans-hungary
5/20/2022,"Sarah Waters’s acclaimed crime novel Fingersmith is the source for this elegant, erotic psychological thriller from Oldboy director Park Chan-wook. Set in a Korea under Japanese occupation in the early 20th century, the tangled tale follows a plot by conman Fujiwara (Ha Jung-woo) to marry heiress Hideko (Kim Min-hee) and then get her committed to an asylum, pocketing her money. He installs sidekick Sook-Hee (Kim Tae-ri) as her maid to assist him, but the young woman and her victim fall in love. Sook-Hee narrates her part in the scheme, but that’s only the half of it, as Hideko then tells her own, very different story – one of child abuse, sadism and pornographic literature.Tuesday 24 May, 1.05am, Film4 Jon M Chu’s unashamedly opulent romantic comedy-drama ticks all the boxes for mainstream success, but it is most notable for its all-Asian cast, still a rarity in Hollywood. Constance Wu plays Chinese-American New Yorker Rachel, who discovers that her boyfriend Nick (Henry Golding) is part of a stupendously wealthy Singapore-Chinese family. Flying over for a wedding, she quickly realises that cultural differences – embodied in Nick’s forbidding mother (a wonderfully steely Michelle Yeoh) – threaten her future happiness with him.Saturday 21 May, 10.20pm, BBC One Barry Keoghan brings a dead-eyed menace to this typically surreal 2017 drama from Yorgos Lanthimos. It’s the story of a rich surgeon named Steven (Colin Farrell) and an intense teenage boy, Martin (Keoghan), whose father died during one of his operations. Martin seeks justice, demanding that Steven kill his wife (Nicole Kidman) or one of his two children. If he doesn’t they will, somehow, all get sick and die. It’s a deadpan horror, coolly acted, with a bizarre but implacable logic derived from its source text, Euripides’s Greek tragedy Iphigenia in Aulis.Saturday 21 May, 1.10am, Film4 Marcello (Marcello Fonte) is a meek dog groomer making a small living in a dilapidated town on the outskirts of Rome, spending quality time with his daughter Alida (Alida Baldari Calabria) and dealing some cocaine on the side. However, he has fallen into a toxic friendship with thuggish criminal Simoncino (Edoardo Pesce), who involves the pliant man in his increasingly dangerous enterprises. Gomorrah director Matteo Garrone’s film is another nuanced, neo-realist slice of life on the margins, where small mistakes can have a cumulatively devastating effect.Sunday, 22 May, 1.40am, Channel 4 This Bafta-winning drama from Zambian-Welsh writer-director Rungano Nyoni is a satirical condemnation of the practice of “witch camps” in some African countries, where women (usually old) who are accused of sorcery are detained. Here, a young girl, Shula (Maggie Mulubwa) is exploited by the tourism minister Mr Banda (Henry BJ Phiri) for her supposed abilities, while the other captives work the fields, forever tied to giant spools of ribbon. A heart-tugging mixture of comedy and tragedy.Sunday 22 May, 1.50am, Film4 Alfred Hitchcock’s 1941 thriller was the first of four fruitful collaborations with Cary Grant, though it’s the only one where his leading man plays a bit of a wrong ’un. Grant’s Johnnie is an eligible bachelor, though a bit “wild” – but for general’s daughter Lina (Joan Fontaine) he represents the excitement she can’t find in her comfortable, rural life. However, after they elope, she realises he is an inveterate gambler and liar, heavily in debt and, she suspects, capable of murder for financial gain. Fontaine won an Oscar for her role, seesawing convincingly between bliss and fear.Thursday 26 May, 9pm, BBC Four Two African-American college friends – bookish Kunle (Donald Elise Watkins) and laidback Sean (an impressive RJ Cyler) – have an epic spring break party night planned, until they stumble on an unconscious white girl on their lounge floor. The film then flips between slapstick campus comedy and deadly serious racial drama as the duo (plus their nerdy Latino roommate) try to help her, while avoiding a run-in with potentially trigger-happy white cops. Carey Williams’s debut feature makes its points succinctly and powerfully, but always with a sense of fun.Friday 27 May, Amazon Prime Video",Arts/Television & radio,The Handmaiden to Crazy Rich Asians: the seven best films to watch on TV this week,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/20/the-handmaiden-to-crazy-rich-asians-the-seven-best-films-to-watch-on-tv-this-week
5/20/2022,"A gruesome flashback to Dr Brenner’s lab cuts to sunny guitar pop and a teenage diary entry. Straight away, we’re back in the universe of Stranger Things, where the fantastical and the commonplace bleed into each other. This ordinariness has always been one of the show’s strengths – but, at times, it has felt as if we’re simply watching a likable, slightly aimless teen drama with the supernatural elements spread thinly. Still, the characters remain nicely realised: the messiness of adolescence is causing Jane/Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) to lose friends and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) to think of finding some new ones. But, as always, the Upside Down is waiting for a likely conduit.Netflix, from Friday 27 May “The Jedi code is like an itch. We cannot help it.” This long-awaited series – a prequel to the original films but set in the aftermath of the later trilogy – fills another gap in the elastic time frame of the Star Wars universe, positing Jedi status as more of a curse than a blessing. It finds Ewan McGregor’s Obi in a more vulnerable place, broken by his experience of Order 66 and living in hiding after the fall of the Republic. Furthermore, Darth Vader (Hayden Christensen) hasn’t finished with our hero – hunting down the Jedi because they represent both opposition to his rule and a hated part of himself.Disney+, from Friday 27 May We are used to David Attenborough explaining natural history to us, but can the nonagenarian explain prehistory? This series exploits a combination of the gravitas conferred by Attenborough’s voice and some stupendous visuals to present a startling vision of the Cretaceous period. With an episode every day this week, this collaboration between the BBC’s Natural History Unit and The Lion King’s photorealist effects team MPC is essentially a classic BBC-style nature epic, transferred to a new menagerie of biting, roaring and scampering creatures.Apple TV+, from Monday 23 May The first season proved divisive, thanks mainly to the design of its animation, which abandoned the classical manga aesthetic of the original comics for a flashy but more generic-looking CGI style. The same gripes remain – albeit with an added layer of irony in a series where the narrative now explores the implications of out-of-control AI leading to a homogenised, posthuman condition. However, the story is developed in complex and interesting ways, dealing with the Orwellian concept of “sustainable war” and the possible end point of evolution.Netflix, from Monday 23 May “That was irony. There’s going to be a bit of that throughout the show. That’s when I say something I don’t really mean, for comic effect.” If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Stewart Lee will be thrilled at having been such a source of inspiration for Gervais’s new hour-long standup special. Or maybe he won’t; in Gervais’s hands, irony often seems the default mode of a man simply wanting to have his cake and eat it – railing against the notion of taboos while relying on them for laughs. Still, he’s undeniably a gifted comic brain, albeit often on autopilot.Netflix, from Tuesday 24 May A fifth season of vicarious travel and food adventures in the company of Everybody Loves Raymond creator Phil Rosenthal. The show’s secret is Rosenthal’s evident delight throughout, not just in the food he tastes but also the people he meets and the regional and national identities he explores. This will be Rosenthal’s first post-Covid series (“The world is opening up again and so is my mouth”) and he’s evidently happy to be back on the road, sampling, among other things, the best sausages in Lisbon and a classic Mexican cantina.Netflix, from Wednesday 25 May The propulsive, multidimensional Nigerian musical phenomenon has long gone global, with Grammy nominations for several of its leading lights. But this success has been years in the making – and film-maker Ayo Shonaiya has been there from the start. Beginning in 1999, this series tracks the emergence of scene pioneers such as Burna Boy and D’Banj, and tells a wider story of Nigerian growth, development and national self-actualisation. Shonaiya accurately describes this labour of love as “a history lesson with a musical soundtrack”.Netflix, from Friday 27 May",Arts/Television & radio,Stranger Things to Obi-Wan Kenobi: the seven best shows to stream this week,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/20/stranger-things-to-obi-wan-kenobi-the-seven-best-shows-to-stream-this-week

5/20/2022,"Look, we wanted to cover something other than British politics today. We hoped to spread our wings, and escape from the Westminster bubble. But you can’t get away from Partygate. Or maybe, if you’re the prime minister… you can, actually? That’s one reading of the news yesterday, as the Metropolitan police announced they had concluded their investigation into gatherings at Downing Street, and neither Boris Johnson or his wife, Carrie, will be facing any more fines. So what’s happened here? A careful investigation finally getting to the truth, an opaque farce that shied away from a difficult conclusion, or something in between? There’s tons of useful reporting and analysis on the Guardian this morning to help you as you try to make your mind up. Today’s newsletter will take you through it, right after the headlines. Nimo’s back on Monday – with, hopefully, something completely different. Health | Chemical pollution in the environment is worsening the global obesity epidemic, a major scientific review has concluded. Scientists say that the impact of “obesogens” can be passed down through generations. Ukraine | The United States has accused Russia of holding the world’s food supply hostage amid growing fears of famine in developing countries. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said Moscow would not allow grain shipments unless sanctions were eased. Executive pay | Next chief executive Simon Wolfson will be paid £4.4m this year, shareholders agreed. Wolfson was awarded a 50% rise despite opposition from some investors over the disparity with wages in the wider workforce. Crime | A man who was obsessed with the American serial killer Ted Bundy has been jailed for a minimum of 30 years after admitting the murder of the teenager Bobbi-Anne McLeod in Plymouth. National Lottery | A Gloucester couple have described the “amazing, but also surreal” discovery that they had won the UK’s biggest lottery haul of £184m. Joe and Jess Thwaite said the news interrupted an otherwise “grumpy morning”. Yesterday was a very good day for Boris Johnson, and anyone claiming otherwise is probably wearing a red rosette. The spectre of multiple fines for breaching coronavirus rules has haunted the prime minister for months. Now he can say that the police have concluded that he was criminally liable for just one incident: a birthday party he didn’t know about, and which he says he attended for less than 10 minutes. For a man whose political career looked like it might be over, that is an excellent result. But today’s front pages suggest that Johnson isn’t quite out of the woods yet. While the Daily Mail and the Daily Express say the news is proof that the story is “farcical” and ask “Can we now just focus on the big issues?”, The Times (£) and the Daily Telegraph (£) both look ahead to civil servant Sue Gray’s impending report, and suggest she wants to name names. And the Guardian reports on a mood of mutiny among civil servants and special advisers who feel that the most junior among them have been scapegoated. So. While the Met’s investigation is at an end, there are plenty of questions about Partygate which remain unresolved, starting with: Is this all just a storm in a teacup? By one view, expressed loudly by supporters of the prime minister for several months and repeated yesterday, it always was. Still, two iron laws of politics have probably helped that narrative flourish – and suggest how different things might have been. First, timing is everything: had it not been for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Johnson’s position might easily have become untenable with his own backbenchers, whose mood towards him has softened enormously in the four months since then-commissioner Cressida Dick U-turned and said that the Met would investigate. The second maxim: it’s always nice to be graded on a curve. Consider how different all of this might have felt if the Met had decided to hold their conclusions back to be released at the same time. To get 26 new fines when you thought the investigation might go on for weeks might not sound that bad; 126 fines all at once, including the prime minister and the chancellor, could have seemed a little different. It’s definitely not a storm in a teacup for the other 82 people to get fines, either. You can read more about what the story means for civil servants, and questions over whether Johnson has truly taken responsibility, in this piece by Jessica Elgot. Why didn’t Johnson get any more fines? We don’t have a definitive answer to this question, maybe the biggest loose end in the whole Partygate story, as the Met don’t publish their reasoning on fixed penalty notices. And to some observers, yesterday’s conclusion doesn’t make a lot of sense. After all, the infamous cake ambush in the cabinet office for which Johnson was fined appeared to be comfortably at the lower end of the spectrum, especially when compared, for instance, to a leaving do for spin doctor Lee Cain, at which Johnson is said to have given a speech and poured drinks. One possible clue to the distinctions that saved Johnson comes in an observation from the Met’s acting deputy commissioner Helen Ball, who said yesterday that the criteria for fines included “whether this was someone’s home [or] wasn’t someone’s home”. Or maybe an organised birthday celebration, however trivial, was deemed an unambiguously social event in a way that drinks for a departing colleague were not. On the other hand, Adam Wagner, a lawyer who has made a specialism of lockdown rules in recent months, observed on Twitter yesterday: “I think the outcome of the Met investigation is that the Prime Minister attended 6 illegal gatherings but attended 5 of them legally.” He went on to tell the Guardian’s Peter Walker: “I don’t see why, if the prime minister had a reasonable excuse for attending, the other people attending wouldn’t… generally, the decision is difficult to understand.” For more on this, read Peter’s examination of the legal issues surrounding the decision here. So is Johnson safe? Safer than he was. The response of backbench MPs yesterday was largely to support the prime minister – and in the end, it’s up to them. But Johnson faces dangerous byelections in Wakefield and Tiverton next month – and he has two other big milestones ahead of him. (You can read more about them in Heather Stewart’s analysis.) The first is Sue Gray’s report, said to be highly critical of the leadership that allowed these events to transpire. The question is whether her final analysis explicitly includes Johnson in that failure. While some who want Johnson gone have given Gray the same semi-mystical saviour status once accorded to Lady Hale in relation to Brexit, both the Times and the Financial Times (£) today quote senior sources who believe that she will stop short of such an unequivocal conclusion. And the BBC hears that Gray will be more damning of the civil service than the prime minister. Even if Johnson survives that, it’s not quite over. He will next be the subject of a parliamentary privileges committee investigation into whether he misled parliament by saying that all guidance was followed in No 10. The Labour chair, Chris Bryant, has recused himself over his past criticism of Johnson - and the committee has a Conservative majority. So, although not impossible, it would be surprising if they reached a conclusion that could force his resignation. So – all that must be good news for the Conservatives? That depends on whether you think an unpopular prime minister hanging on to office despite public disapproval is great for the party brand. James Johnson, a former Downing Street pollster for Theresa May, noted yesterday that while Johnson’s position has stabilised, the news “also means the gap between what Tory MPs think and what the public thinks continues to widen. And that is better news for Labour than it is the Conservatives”. Meanwhile, new polling for Ipsos Mori has found that Labour’s lead is at six points. Even despite all that, it’s probably a bit out there to view the prime minister’s victory as a catastrophe for his party, especially when his opponent is still on the hook to resign if he gets an FPN himself over the “Beergate” story. In the end, the biggest problem for Johnson might not be anything the police have said – but the space that the conclusion of this story will open up for political focus on the cost of living crisis, and the prospect of a wounded prime minister trying to deal with it. A chimney sweep, some stolen jewels and a lost phone dominated proceedings at the high court on Thursday, as Coleen Rooney’s barrister, David Sherborne, accused Rebekah Vardy and her agent of a concerted effort to “cover up incriminating evidence”. In response, Vardy’s barrister doubted his client was either clever enough or cynical enough to have deleted incriminating messages. With friends like that … Vardy’s agent, Caroline Watt, and the mobile phone that ended up at the bottom of the North Sea again occupied much of Rooney’s defence – and Jim Waterson did his best to explain Sherborne’s reliance on a 300-year-old precedent – involving the aforementioned sweep – and why this “fishy story” is Rooney’s best hope of victory. The trial is now over – so when will the verdict be revealed? It’s due ………. “later this year”. “One can only imagine how badly [Vardy’s] position would look were the court to have access to what she was able to successfully delete. What remains cannot be anything other than the tip of the iceberg.” Keir Giles says despite significant military losses for Russia in Ukraine, there’s still a long way to go. Celebration would be premature, Giles writes, as the country continues to be devastated by a war that may drag on for months, or even years, to come.

Nimo Football | Everton secured their Premier League status for another season with a 3-2 comeback win over Crystal Palace. Burnley’s 1-1 draw against Aston Villa means Leeds must better Burnley’s result on Sunday to avoid dropping into the Championship. Football | A man has been jailed for 24 weeks after pleading guilty to assaulting the Sheffield United captain, Billy Sharp. Sharp was headbutted during a pitch invasion at the end of his club’s match against Nottingham Forest on Tuesday. Cricket | The England fast bowler Jofra Archer, whose injury troubles have kept him out of cricket since last July, has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a stress fracture to his lower back. “Fury as Johnson escapes Partygate with single fine” is how the Guardian handles the Partygate fallout on its front page. The Mirror plays on Boris Johnson’s previous claim that “no Covid rules were broken” and contrasts that with a headline simply saying “126 fines”. The Telegraph goes with “Sue Gray demands to name partygate ringleaders” and while the Times reports that Gray is frustrated by “police secrecy”, its lead is “Doctors to give sleep app rather than pills”. The i’s front page story is “Tories ask Johnson: the party’s over, so what’s the plan?”. The Mail’s splash is “What a farcical waste of time and £460,000” and the Express asks “Can we now just focus on the big issues?”. The Sun leads on the big lottery win with “Lucky tip!”. In Scotland the big story is the prospect of lengthy rail strikes this summer. “Mass strikes threaten to grind Scotland to a halt for months”, the Herald says.
