5/5/2022,"Victoria’s minister for women, Gabrielle Williams, has described a Facebook post by Liberal MP Bernie Finn as “deplorable” after he wrote that he was “praying” for abortion to be banned in Australia. The post was published on the upper house MP’s Facebook page on Wednesday night, after the leak of a draft decision showing a majority of US supreme court justices may overturn Roe v Wade, which makes abortion a constitutional right. “So excited the US is on the verge of a major breakthrough to civilisation. Praying it will come here soon. Killing babies is criminal,” Finn said in the post. When a woman, who commented she didn’t support abortion but believed there should be an option for victims of sexual assault, Finn replied: “Babies should not be killed for the crime of his or her parent.” In a statement to Guardian Australia, Williams said there was no place for Finn’s comments in the community and urged the opposition leader, Matthew Guy, to take action. “These are deplorable comments, that show an appalling lack of respect for women and completely disregard the trauma experienced by victims of sexual assault – instead prioritising the decisions of perpetrators over the needs of women victims of crime,” Williams said. “We support all women to make choices that are right for them – women have the right to access reproductive services safely, legally and with dignity.” Guy said the social media comments reflected Finn’s longstanding personal views on the issue. “I am not interested in commenting on social policy in the United States,” he told reporters on Thursday. “You can talk to Bernie about his points of view, but the Liberal party in Victoria focuses on matters in Victoria, not social policy in the United States. That is not on my radar in the slightest.” Asked about the Liberal party’s stance on abortion, Guy said the party had allowed a conscience vote on the matter for many years. “We’ve had free votes for many, many years on this matter – they’ll always continue,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Abortion Law Reform Act 2008 decriminalised abortion in Victoria. Under the act, a woman can legally terminate a pregnancy up to 24 weeks of pregnancy. It’s not the first time Finn has been criticised for his social media posts. Last year, he deleted a Facebook post in which he compared premier Daniel Andrews to Adolf Hitler. He has also expressed support for Donald Trump and the rioters who stormed the US Capitol building. In an interview with Guardian Australia earlier this year, Guy dismissed reports Finn would be challenged for the No 1 position on the Western Metropolitan upper house ticket. He described Finn as a “very loud and proud conservative”. “Just because most of the mainstream media don’t like his views, that doesn’t mean that people who have his views shouldn’t have a place in parliament,” Guy said.",News/Australia news,Victorian upper house MP’s post about abortion described as ‘deplorable’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/05/victorian-upper-house-mps-post-about-abortion-described-as-deplorable
5/5/2022,"‘Still think you can control them?” Dizzied by their divinely decadent menage à trois in Weimar Berlin, cabaret singer Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli), shy scholar Brian Roberts (Michael York) and suave aristocrat Baron von Heune (Helmut Griem) linger in a beer garden to watch a creepy blond boy singing Tomorrow Belongs to Me with the entire crowd ecstatically joining in – a satanically catchy and authentic-sounding Nazi marching song, brilliantly pastiched by Cabaret’s writer and composer, John Kander and Fred Ebb. (Brian’s question is famously addressed to the Baron, who had airily claimed the Nazis could be controlled after they had done the dirty work of crushing the communists.) It is a sensational moment in this addictive movie, based on the stage show Cabaret and Christopher Isherwood’s original stories about prewar Berlin, uniquely choreographed and directed by Bob Fosse and rereleased now for its 50th anniversary. Maybe its views on gender fluidity and consent are confrontationally tactless in 2022 compared with 1972 or 1931. But its view of fascism is still very relevant: extremism and racism are enabled by cynicism, irony and exhaustion. This time around, I couldn’t watch Joel Grey’s death’s-head grin as the MC presiding over the raucous Kit Kat Club without thinking of smirking Elon Musk in charge of the unending Twitter quarrelfest. Bowles is the star turn of the Kit Kat, a gadabout American who lives in a rackety Berlin boarding house where she meets sweetly unworldly Brian, a research student at King’s College, Cambridge, who has come to teach during the long vacation. Brian is to fall in love with Sally, but also to see her enamoured of the coolly predatory and wealthy baron who is to sweep them both up in his own whirl of jaded sensual diversion. And all the time, the Nazi presence spreads across the city like a rash, while the sinister MC – whose own private life is a mystery – seems to intuit or satirise it, or, ambiguously, welcome it, as something that can’t be helped. While he’s doing his bizarre hands-knees-and-boomps-a-daisy routine in Lederhosen with the chorus girls, the manager is being brutally beaten up outside the club by Nazis furious that they have not been allowed in. Minnelli is glorious, perhaps especially in the classic opener Mein Herr – even better here, I think, than Marlene Dietrich singing Falling in Love Again in The Blue Angel. With magnificent hauteur she tells an infatuated lover to get lost. In the past, I have always imagined that she is addressing some middle-aged married man, a pathetic guy who has spent all his money on her while his wife and kids go hungry. But watching the movie again I can see it’s actually addressed to poor future-Brian (the song comes immediately after meeting him) and it prophesies the terrible end to their relationship. In fact, all of Minnelli’s songs are wonderful; it’s interesting to watch her final number, the hymn to the cabaret itself, in which the cramped stage seems suddenly to quadruple in size and looks more like Vegas or London’s Talk of the Town: it’s a very Judy Garland moment. Cabaret is still an amazing experience, a world fiddling while Rome prepares to burn: gloomily sexy, elegant, with an overwhelming sense of evil.  Cabaret is released on 6 May in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Cabaret review – Liza Minnelli musical still divinely decadent and chillingly relevant,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/05/cabaret-review-decadent-chillingly-relevant-liza-minelli
5/5/2022,"It’s not every day you wind up at a lock-in with a circle of new best mates. But this is Dover and, as I’m to learn, it’s full of surprises, despite having been overshadowed by Deal and Folkestone as a destination in its own right. Holding court at the White Horse is convivial proprietor and “rude bald man” Stuart Fox (his moniker is chalked above the bar) who, together with his partner Julian Crowley, runs the oldest pub in town. Housed in a 700-year-old building, the White Horse has been an alehouse since 1574, the cellar once a morgue for bodies recovered from the sea. Nowadays, most famously, its walls are adorned with the victory scribbles of cross-Channel swimmers, a practice first started in 2002. But with no more space left, “it’s not allowed,” says Stuart, firmly – but not, in fact, rudely. Rewind back to lunchtime and the sun is streaming into the pub’s panelled rooms, refurbished this year to “strip back decades of lead paint to the natural wood”, says Stuart. My friend Zeren and I are tucking into the house speciality, a vast golden-crusted homemade pie with deep chicken and bacon filling. I’m here because I’m fascinated by Dover. A Margate boy, I’ve written about the Kent coast for 15 years, but until now, only mentioned the town in passing. And yet I’ve heard the rumours about artists moving into cheap studio space, the new taprooms, the under-the-radar restaurants; then there’s the regeneration of the town centre, and £250m revival of the Western Docks, including a new cargo terminal and marina. But Dover’s past is equally fascinating: the most historic British seaside town, it dates back to AD46, when the Romans established the port of Dubris. World-famous Dover Castle aside, other architectural gems include unspoilt Castle Street, the elegant 19th-century seafront, and medieval buildings such as the 800-year-old Maison Dieu (part of the town hall), whose £9.1m restoration will see it reopening in 2024 as part of a heritage quarter. But still, to locals’ dismay, the town attracts bad press. “Where Margate is traditional seaside, Dover’s industrial,” says Diederik Smet, who heads Destination Dover. “And while there’s an extremely strong community, it feels transient for visitors because of the nature of the ports. Its public profile is much larger than the town, so everyone knows when lorries are stacking up that you’ll get stuck in traffic. But in fact it’s easy from London on a high-speed train – just over an hour and you’re in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty with incredible heritage.” Another issue is layout, with the esplanade carved up from the town by the roar of the A20. “There are huge works to improve the visitor experience,” he says. “The new £3.6m Market Square and water feature opens this summer with a stage area, events and performance schedule, as well as new food and drink options. E-bike hire is starting. And, on the waterfront, the new Marina Curve is now home to streetfood stalls and bars.” After lunch, Zeren and I start our own exploration at wittily named new micropub The Hoptimist, before a stroll along the River Dour to craft beer haven Breakwater Brewery for a signature Dover pale ale; we later head to its new outpost on the Marina Curve, a spectacular location for a pint with panoramic views. Another recent addition is wine bar Vinoteq, whose low-lit basement hosts atmospheric jazz nights. But Dover’s history means its long-established pubs are worth exploring, too. The Louis Armstrong is an unspoilt live music venue with a rich vein of cultural history. Originally called The Grapes (the name changed in 1972 to honour the jazz star’s passing), its atmospheric interior seems unchanged for half a century: tankards above the bar glisten as sun rays bounce off the ochre walls, and the walls are crammed with gig posters by a stage where live music still takes place most nights. “It’s where musicians in the 60s used to play their last gig before leaving for the continent,” artist Joanna Jones tells me the next day. “It’s like a spiritual home. You know, you quickly realise that Dover has had this cultural life. It has this deep history.” Jones moved from Berlin in 1997, founding the artist-led not-for-profit DAD (Dover Arts Development) a decade later with friend Clare Smith. Together, the duo has been pivotal in rebooting the creative spirit in Dover, working with hundreds of artists, bringing in over £1m of arts-led investment. “I’d like to question whether the public perception of Dover is wrong, or whether it’s to Dover’s advantage in the end,” she says. “If somebody bothers to take time, it’s there. What look like empty streets contain so much; and while the town itself, being formerly industrial, has some of the most deprived wards in Kent, Dover is an icon known all over the world. Its history is more akin to a big city, despite a tiny population of just over 30,000, and it is iconic simply because of leaving and arriving: sometimes it’s a frontier, sometimes it’s welcoming. But we mustn’t also forget its ties with trauma: the number of bombs in the second world war that went off was huge. So it’s got all these anomalies.” How is the town changing? “It’s going into another arena now: 18 artists have relocated from London in the last two years, some with big careers. It attracts working artists, and studio space is now what people are wanting more of, and that’s what’s available here. A lot of artists have taken allotments, so there’s a very thriving community. And Dover Pride is successful, something people may not also expect.” Jones is keen on its green spaces, which have benefited from £3.1m lottery funding. “Kearsney Abbey and Russell Gardens are the most loved parks, where everybody goes in the summer. And up on the White Cliffs, there’s nothing between you and the sky; I can really breathe up there.” While it’s always been a working town, she says, “the Dovorian spirit of bravery and resistance is there.” I think about her words as I tuck into a South African chargrilled chicken wrap for lunch, zingy with watermelon, mint and pomegranate. It’s from the shiny new Big Pan streetfood stall on the just-unveiled Clocktower Square on Marina Curve, a waterfront brimming with positivity under blue skies. And indeed Dover’s eating-out scene also holds surprises, from two Marco Pierre White seafront restaurants and firmly established local favourites like Cullin’s Yard and Aspendos to a new branch of Folkestone’s acclaimed Thong Dee’s Thai, new artisan coffee shops Market Square Kitchen and Café Melange, as well as outstanding Nepalese dining room Momohub, whose dumplings – fried, steamed or ‘jhol’ (in gravy) – are among the finest plates I’ve eaten this year. As I return to Churchill House, an 18th-century B&B with bohemian furnishings, I stop to walk past the houseplants in my private conservatory and up some steps to a raised terrace filled with outsize ferns and mature palms. You would never know this little tropical paradise is in Dover. “I like places that don’t offer their goods easily,” Jones said earlier. “And that’s what I think makes Dover interesting. What makes it develop in a unique way.” Accommodation was provided by Destination Dover at the Churchill House B&B (doubles from £70 B&B).

5/5/2022,"Ifind going to the theatre extremely challenging. You must sit perfectly still, and you have to concentrate. These are two things I find nigh on impossible. When I was a kid, everybody told me I had ants in my pants. In middle age I was told by a psychiatrist that I had attention deficit disorder. This pathologisation of having ants in one’s pants has been greatly reassuring to me, as well as a very useful sicknote for theatre invitations. Sometimes, though, needs must. Jez Butterworth’s Jerusalem, directed by Ian Rickson and starring Mark Rylance, demanded to be seen. I’ve met Ian a couple of times and like him. He’s a Charlton fan, and theatre people who are also into football I’ve always found to be excellent coves. I liked him even more when I saw a sign in the foyer indicating there would be three acts, with two intervals. For the neurodiverse this felt like nothing less than an act of compassion. Even so, notwithstanding the excellence of the production, there were moments when the challenge of keeping perfectly still, quiet and focused quite overwhelmed me. Inwardly I became frantic. The ants seethed in my pants. My mind raced. A school friend’s experience from 30 years ago came to mind. Vicky was taken on a date to the Birmingham Rep to see Waiting for Godot. Bored and baffled in equal measure, her heart broke with relief when it ended. But then it broke again when her date told her this was only the interval. No such problems here. Rylance was luminously brilliant, even by his own standards. But I’m afraid that didn’t spare him the odd dark thought from me when I went through a bad patch. It’s all bloody right for you, I heckled inwardly – you can move around and shout and scream and twitch. Try sitting here! Come the final whistle, I stood, applauded, and ran out into London’s glittering West End to shout, scream and twitch for all I was worth.

5/5/2022,"Polls will close at 10pm in Thursday’s local elections, in which the Conservatives expect to face a drubbing from voters over the rising cost of living and Partygate. Here are some of the key races to watch if you’re staying up overnight and into Friday. From 2am we should start seeing some interesting results trickle through, including in Bolton, which should give a good early indicator as to whether Labour is making any comeback in the north of England. The borough has been run by a minority Conservative administration since 2019, and this time it is likely to tip into no overall control. Tory sources are cautiously optimistic that Labour is not yet making enough impact. Wirral is also on a knife-edge, with Labour hoping to make strides towards a majority but the Greens and Tories potentially making gains. Four huge results for Labour could come in between 5am and 7am on Friday. The most significant would be taking the London borough of Wandsworth, which has has remained solidly blue through many political storms. We expect Derby council to declare by about 5am, where Labour hopes to make gains. And Southampton at 5am is one that Labour desperately hopes to snatch from the Tories, who took control a year ago. This would compound Tory fears about losing voters in the south. At 7am Labour hopes to take Barnet council in north London for the first time. The party underperformed in 2018 amid concerns about antisemitism, and gaining the council would show Keir Starmer has assuaged some fears on that front. At 2pm, Worthing will be an interesting result to see if the Conservatives lose the south-coast council for the first time. Newcastle-under-Lyme in the Midlands should declare at about 3pm and give some indication if Labour is making gains in areas it would need to win back to prevail in a general election. The Liberal Democrats are hoping to take Somerset council at about 4pm, which would indicate that the party has a decent chance in the upcoming Tiverton and Honiton byelection. Glasgow council at 5pm will be the bellwether for Labour’s fortunes in Scotland, though ultimately the main goal will be to overtake the Tories as the largest unionist party and show gains against the SNP. Kirklees is one of Labour’s most closely watched councils. The party hopes to win the two seats it needs for a majority, and to indicate it is on course to win the neighbouring Wakefield byelection. It should declare at about 6pm. Monmouthshire is the most interesting council to watch in Wales, as the only council where the Conservatives could lose a majority, at about 7pm.",News/Politics,Local elections 2022: key councils to watch and when the results will come in ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/05/local-elections-2022-key-councils-to-watch-and-when-the-results-will-come-in
5/5/2022,"A leaked draft of a supreme court opinion shows that the country’s highest court is on the verge of overturning the 1973 landmark decision Roe v Wade, which guarantees a federal right to abortion. In its absence, states hostile to abortion would be free to ban or severely restrict the procedure. That would leave entire regions of the country without an abortion clinic within a day’s drive, reshaping the geography of abortion access in America in a single seismic shift. More than half of US states would be certain or likely to ban abortion if the supreme court overturns Roe v Wade. Several states already have abortion bans on the books that would no longer be blocked by Roe v Wade, while others have “trigger laws”, which would be put in motion should the federal government no longer protect reproductive rights. When those states ban abortion, about a quarter of the country’s abortion clinics would close – overwhelmingly in states where clinics are already sparse. In Cameron county, at the southern tip of Texas, a woman would need to travel to a clinic more than 680 miles away in New Mexico. On the meandering roads of rural America, that’s more than 800 miles: a 12-hour drive. A 2017 study found that half of US women live within 11 miles (17km) of an abortion clinic, but about 20% of them have to travel 43 miles (68km). Abortion bans in half of US states would drastically increase those travel times, particularly in the south, where a large swath of contiguous states are likely to ban abortion. But traveling to another state for an abortion may not even be an option. People who seek abortions are disproportionately likely to have low incomes, and most already have children. Experts also warn that states may pass laws to restrict women from traveling out of state to seek abortion services. A handful of states do have legal protections for abortion, either in their constitution or as statutes. While existing abortion laws may not immediately kick in after Roe v Wade is overturned, Republicans in some of those states are expected to make a push to ban abortion. In Kansas, for example, the constitution protects a woman’s right to access abortion, but a referendum in August will determine whether that protection will be eliminated. A poll earlier this year found that more than 60% of Kansans oppose making abortion completely illegal. But the referendum is part of the primary elections, and primary voters tend to be more conservative. Meanwhile, the Washington Post reports that Republican senators have discussed federal legislation to ban abortion after six weeks, called “heartbeat” bills by proponents. Many women don’t know they are pregnant until after six weeks, and a 2018 study found that younger women, women of color and women without college degrees are more likely to find out after the seven-week mark. Together, these new restrictions could further endanger legal protections in states that support abortion rights.",News/World news,Abortion deserts: America’s new geography of access to care – mapped,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/abortion-deserts-clinics-access-closed-map
5/5/2022,"The roaring success of Covid vaccines – in countries able to obtain them – has led to deaths and severe disease from the infection plummeting even as the virus evolved to sidestep immunity and rip through populations more swiftly. But while the rapid development of Covid shots ranks as the finest achievement of the pandemic, scientists are not done yet. In a small number of labs around the world, teams are taking on a problem that cannot be ignored: that the virus remains rampant in the face of mass immunity. The problem has arisen because existing Covid vaccines are better at preparing the immune system to fight the virus inside the body than stopping it at the gates. So even though immunity has largely “defanged” Covid, countries still face waves of infection that hospitalise vulnerable people, keep staff off work, and leave an uncertain proportion of people with long Covid. Hopes to halt the spread of infection are riding on the development of vaccines that are delivered by a spray up the nose rather than a shot in the arm. They aim to produce strong immune protection in the nose and throat, where most Covid infections gain a foothold. Beyond their potential to block infections, intranasal sprays may be more acceptable to people who are not keen on needles. “If you think of your body as a castle, an intramuscular vaccination is really protecting the inner areas of your castle so once invaders come in, that immunity protects against them taking the throne,” said Dr Sean Liu, medical director of the Covid clinical trials unit at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. “But if you train your immune system to work at the gates of the castle, then the invaders not only have trouble getting in, but they may have trouble spreading inside.” Liu is running an early-stage trial on an intranasal Covid vaccine made in a similar way to seasonal flu vaccines, meaning it could be churned out by the same facilities and dramatically improve global access to Covid vaccines. More than a dozen clinical trials of intranasal Covid vaccines are under way, but the process is not without its challenges. For an intranasal vaccine to work, it should produce a robust and lasting immune response in the nasal mucosa, the moist membrane that lines the inside of the nose. It helps, too, if people do not swallow or sneeze it out, which can make reliable dosing difficult. The widely used Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do not immediately lend themselves to intranasal delivery. Both vaccines use tiny, fatty nanoparticles to smuggle the genetic instructions (RNA) for the coronavirus spike protein into cells which prime the immune system. “In theory, RNA vaccines could work, but nobody has worked out how to deliver them as an effective intranasal spray,” said Prof Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London. “The lipid nanoparticles are quite delicate and work beautifully when you inject them into the body, but it’s more of an engineering problem to work out how to deliver them into the nose, get them across the mucus, and into the cells.” So far, only one intranasal vaccine has found a wide market, namely AstraZeneca’s influenza spray, marketed as Flumist in the US and – mindful of potential misunderstandings in Germany – Fluenz in Europe. The vaccine uses a weakened influenza virus, which can get into the cells of the nasal lining and provoke an immune reaction. It not only protects the individual against flu, but helps to reduce community infections, a feat scientists want to repeat with Covid. An early-stage trial of an intranasal version of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is expected to publish results soon. The Oxford vaccine is based on a weakened adenovirus, which may be able to induce an immune response in the nose. But all researchers face hurdles with intranasal vaccines, including measuring the strength of the immune response, knowing how protective it will be, and how long it might last. If an intranasal vaccine provides strong protection against infection, but only for a few months, it may work best as an autumn booster, topping up Covid jabs that provide more enduring “systemic” protection against severe disease. “I think you’d want the systemic vaccine as well because it’s so important for protecting against severe disease,” said Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag). “I wouldn’t want to just rely on a purely mucosal immunisation unless it can also generate a decent systemic response.” Dr Sandy Douglas, a pharmaceutical physician who works on the Oxford vaccine, does not expect any intranasal Covid vaccines to be available this year. “Nobody should put off having their intramuscular vaccine to wait for a nasal spray,” he said. “But as a midterm prospect, this is one of the most important questions in vaccinology, not just for Covid, but for the next pandemic,” he added. “How do we make vaccines that are good at completely stopping infection with respiratory viruses? We need to solve that problem as soon as we possibly can. It may be that it takes a significant amount of effort and investment, but I’d say it’s absolutely worth it. We can see how big the advantage would be if we had vaccines that completely stopped infection.”",News/Society,Are nasal sprays the answer to stopping Covid transmission?,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/05/are-nasal-sprays-vaccine-answer-to-stopping-covid-transmission
5/5/2022,"Polls have opened in the local elections, with both major parties frenetically managing expectations as a Tory mayor warns Boris Johnson he will have to go further in helping people struggling with the cost of living. The results will be seen as a major test for Johnson and Keir Starmer, coming at the ostensible mid-way point of the UK government’s term. A total of 146 English councils, and all those in Scotland and Wales, are up for grabs – as well as seven mayoralties. In Northern Ireland, voters will also elect 90 members to the devolved assembly in a contest from which Sinn Féin could emerge as the largest party. Coming after the prime minister and chancellor were fined for breaking Covid laws, the pressure is on the Conservatives to make some gains on councils across the country. The last time these seats in England were contested was 2018 and in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales it was 2017 – one of the lowest periods of the Conservative’ party’s popularity given deep divisions over the handling of Brexit by Theresa May. Tory MPs have indicated mixed responses on the doorstep, with those in the party’s traditional southern heartlands concerned that voters will stay at home. Some are even plotting for a poor result to be the excuse to launch a fresh leadership challenge against Johnson. The Liberal Democrats’ deputy leader, Daisy Cooper, accused Johnson of failing to visit many of the towns, villages and cities in the south of England that have become known as the “blue wall”. She said: “Your no-show in this election is an insult to millions of people.” Meanwhile, Tory peer and elections expert Robert Hayward said postal vote returns were down “quite markedly” compared with 2018. He added: “My expectation is therefore that turnout will be hard pushed to reach 30% in 2022. “I don’t think this will benefit any one party but more that the electorate is saying ‘a plague on all your houses’.” Hayward told the Guardian he was staggered by the “the range of expectation management by the two major parties”, given Tory insiders fear the party could be on course to lose up to half the seats they are defending and some Labour figures have downplayed the chances of many gains. “It’s a bigger range than I’ve ever experienced before,” Hayward said. Andy Street, the Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, said that people would predominantly vote on “local issues” – such as bin collections, schools and transport. He acknowledged the cost of living crisis was a “genuine issue” and said Sunak had made “some good first moves”, but said the government would have to go further to mitigate the effects of spiralling energy bills, before the price cap is raised again in the autumn. Street told the Guardian: “I’m expecting movement before the autumn and it looks sadly now as though that will be necessary, because we do seem to be heading into another price hike. So I’m expecting further moves.” Despite some candidates badging themselves as “Local Conservatives” and urging voters not to punish them for “mistakes made in Westminster”, Street said there was “an incredible goodwill” among people towards Johnson, and that he remained an electoral asset. In his closing pitch, Starmer tried to move attention on from questions about him drinking a beer with colleagues in April 2021 and stressed that voters would be motivated predominantly by the cost of living. Asked if Durham constabulary had contacted him in recent days, the Labour leader said: “I have not had contact from Durham constabulary and I think people are just about fed up with the mudslinging that’s going on.” “This relentless focus on mudslinging instead of the issue in hand by the Conservatives means that they’ve got no answer to the real question that so many people want answered, which is: ‘What are you going to do to help me with my bills?’ “We’ve got a clear answer to that, which is a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, and use that to help people pay their bills, up to £600 off their bills.” Johnson also sought to downplay concerns about the Partygate scandal, and insisted he would still be leader of the Conservatives at the next general election. The prime minister said he was “absolutely confident that we have the right agenda for the country”, and added: “I have a big mandate to deliver.” However, Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said Johnson’s leadership was a factor in encouraging some people to switch to his party because the prime minister was not a “decent man”. He said: “That’s a group of lifelong Tories who are telling us they’ll never vote Tory again while Boris Johnson’s prime minister, and many of them are switching to us.” Polling stations are open across the country from 7am until 10pm. Some results will be announced overnight, but others may not come until much later the following day.",News/Politics,Parties manage expectations as voting in local elections begins,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/05/parties-manage-expectations-as-voting-in-local-elections-begins
5/5/2022,"Visibly shaking with fury and brandishing megaphones and posters, thousands of women defending reproductive rights in America thronged below the marbled columns of the US supreme court to protest against what appears to be the imminent demise of the 1973 Roe v Wade ruling recognizing abortion as a constitutional right. “Do something, Democrats,” the crowd chanted at one point. In the hours that followed, Democrats, who currently control the House, the Senate and the White House, echoed their outrage and vowed a response. The urgency follows a leak late on Monday evening of a draft opinion from the court that a majority of the nine judges on the bench – all conservative-leaning appointees of Republican presidents – support not just more restrictions on abortion services but the overturning of the landmark Roe ruling that guarantees the right to abortion when final opinions are issued in June. “I am furious – furious that Republicans could be this cruel, that the supreme court could be this heartless, that in legislatures across the country, extreme Republicans are ready for their trigger bans to go into effect,” Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat of Washington and a longtime advocate of women’s reproductive rights, said. Speaking from the steps of the US Capitol, she was referring to states that have legislative bans on abortion prepared and waiting to be “triggered” into effect as soon as Roe is overturned. “It is craven and we won’t stand for it,” she said. “I’m not going to sit quietly and neither should any of you.” Yet, infuriatingly for the pro-choice voters who helped elect Joe Biden and a Democratic Congress, the party finds itself largely powerless at present, without a legislative path forward to protect abortion rights in the likely event the court reverses its decision in Roe. Biden said it would be a “radical decision” by the court and called on Congress to act to enshrine the rights afforded by Roe into federal law via legislation. And Vice-President Kamala Harris, speaking to attendees at a gala hosted by Emily’s List, which works to elect Democrats who support abortion rights, railed that a ruling overturning Roe would be a “direct assault on freedom” in America. Barring swift legislative action, nearly half of US states are likely to ban abortion or severely restrict access to the procedure. But the reality of Democrats’ thin congressional majorities is that they don’t have enough support in the evenly divided US Senate to codify abortion protections, nor do they have the votes to eliminate the so-called filibuster rule, thus allowing legislation to pass with a simple majority. Biden has resisted pressure from progressives to use his bully pulpit to call for eliminating the filibuster, following recent demands to do so to pass voting rights legislation. And on Tuesday, he said he was “not prepared” to do so to protect reproductive rights. Nevertheless, the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, vowed to forge ahead with a vote on current legislation that is stalled in Congress but, if it could be passed would enshrine a woman’s right to end her pregnancy. But the measure, a version of which passed the Democratic-controlled House last year, was already rejected once this year, when it fell far short of the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster. It didn’t even win the support of all 50 Democrats, so even if the filibuster were scrapped the bill, called the Women’s Health Protection Act, would not have passed in the Senate. Senator Joe Manchin, an anti-abortion Democrat from West Virginia, voted with Republicans to block consideration of the bill. The bill also failed to attract the support of two pro-choice Senate Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who have introduced separate legislation that they say would codify Roe. Yet Schumer argued that it was important to put every senator on the record. “A vote on this legislation is no longer an abstract exercise. This is as urgent and real as it gets,” he said. The leaked draft decision, written by the conservative justice Samuel Alito, would shift the question of whether abortion should be legal to the individual states. The effect would dramatically alter the US landscape almost overnight, with restrictions and bans going into effect across much of the south and midwest while abortion would remain legal in many north-eastern and western states. Emboldened by the supreme court’s conservative super-majority, Republican legislatures have enacted a flurry of new abortion laws as conservative activists begin to lay the groundwork for a nationwide ban. On Tuesday, as the country reeled from the revelation that the supreme court was likely to dismantle Roe, Oklahoma’s Republican governor signed into law a bill that would ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, a copycat version of a Texas law enacted last year. Meanwhile, liberal states have moved to safeguard abortion protections. Last week, Connecticut lawmakers approved a bill that would protect abortion providers in the state. And states like California and New York have vowed to be a “sanctuary” for people seeking reproductive care from places where the procedure is banned. With few options, Democrats have implored Americans shocked and angered by the seemingly impending loss of abortion rights to vote in the midterm elections. Majorities of Americans say they want abortion to remain legal in some or most cases. Few say they want the court to overturn Roe. But Democrats face steep headwinds in November, weighed down by Biden’s low approval ratings, rising inflation and a sour national mood. The Republican reaction to the news that the nation’s highest court was prepared to strike down Roe was relatively subdued. In the Senate, lawmakers were far more focused on the source of the leaked document than the decision, which is the culmination of a decades-long drive by the conservative movement to overturn Roe. The response suggested that there may be some concern that Republicans are worried about provoking a political backlash among more moderate and independent voters who broadly support a constitutional right to abortion. “There’s an answer,” the Illinois senator Dick Durbin, the majority whip, said at a press conference. “The answer is in November.” But many Democrats and activists believe November is too late for millions of women in states where abortion will banned almost immediately. They want the party – from the president on down – to throw every ounce of their political capital at finding a legislative solution. “People elected Democrats precisely so we could lead in perilous moments like these- to codify Roe, hold corruption accountable, & have a President who uses his legal authority to break through Congressional gridlock on items from student debt to climate,” Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive Democrat from New York, wrote on Twitter. “It’s high time we do it.”",News/US news,"‘Do something, Democrats’: party struggles to rise to abortion challenge",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/05/democrats-voters-senate-midterm-abortion
5/5/2022,"My partner and I had an easyJet flight booked from Pisa to Gatwick to visit my terminally ill mother. EasyJet cancelled it 15 days before we were due to fly and told us we could rebook for no extra charge. When we tried to the website showed our flight as “sold out” rather than cancelled and there were no alternatives available for that week, so we applied for a refund. Four days later, we found the airline had reintroduced a flight on our travel date, but at more than double the price we had paid.FD, Pisa, ItalyYou had paid €214 for the pair of you, whereas a single seat on the new flight cost €225. Understandably, you suspect easyJet was trying to shed cheaper bookings and force passengers to pay more. The airline insists that was not the case, but there are many unanswered questions here. EasyJet’s notification to passengers claimed that the cancellation was outside its control and was an extraordinary circumstance (very rare things such as volcanic eruptions or terror attacks that absolve airlines from paying passengers compensation for cancellations). I asked easyJet what extraordinary problem it had foreseen 15 days in advance. It said: “We pre-emptively cancelled a small proportion of our flights in order to provide customers with advance notice to be able to rebook and minimise the impact on their plans.” In other words, it was a voluntary decision to do you a favour. Eventually it conceded that it had incorrectly declared the circumstances extraordinary. In fact, it told me, it was due to high levels of crew sickness. As to why alternative flights suddenly appeared on the schedule four days after you had accepted a refund, it claimed that they were there all along but had sold out so didn’t show up. Subsequent passenger cancellations allowed them to reappear. That’s odd because your original cancelled flight was labelled sold out and was still visible when you tried to rebook. EasyJet says that this was to prevent new passengers booking on to a flight that was in the process of being cancelled. All this is very troubling. An extraordinary circumstance that wasn’t extraordinary. A cancelled flight that showed as sold out. Sold out flights that weren’t, ultimately, sold out. And a hefty bill for you. Only because of my intervention did easyJet say that, as a “gesture of goodwill”, it would book you on to a flight of your choice at no extra cost.

5/5/2022,"Good morning, and try to control your excitement: it’s local elections day in the UK!! YES!!! No, wait, don’t go: today’s votes matter not only because of the usual issues (bins, potholes, housing) – but also because we’re in a cost of living crisis where local government has control of many of the levers that can affect it. And then there’s the national picture – in particular Boris Johnson’s security as prime minister -that the results will help us to understand. Tomorrow, results will come in from more than 6,800 seats in 200 local authorities, and the big parties – having downplayed their chances in advance – will furiously seek to present the outcome as a success. For today we’re asking: do voters care about Partygate? Is Keir Starmer making an impression? And what about the constitutional questions in play in Scotland and Northern Ireland? Guardian reporters tell us what they’ve been hearing on the ground about all of this – right after the headlines. Ukraine | A Ukrainian commander in the Mariupol steelworks said fierce fighting was underway late last night. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen proposed a total EU ban on Russian oil imports, a major escalation in sanctions. Abortion | As the US supreme court threatens to strike down the right to abortion, Joe Biden has said LGBTQ+ children could be the next targets of a Trump-dominated Republican party he called “this Maga crowd” and “the most extreme political organisation … in recent American history”. Cost of living | Shoppers can deal with the cost of living crisis by choosing value brands in the supermarket, the environment secretary suggested. George Eustice said that by doing so people “can actually contain and manage their household budget”. Climate crisis | A climate-sceptic thinktank, the Global Warming Policy Foundation, has received funding from groups with oil and gas interests despite insisting that it remains independent from the fossil fuel industry. The thinktank has led a backlash against the government’s net zero policies. US | Amber Heard told a court that her ex-husband Johnny Depp abused drugs and said the first time he hit her it “changed my life”. Heard is testifying in Depp’s lawsuit against her for claiming she was a victim of domestice abuse. How much will voters be motivated by Partygate? Boris Johnson is unlikely to collect the rubbish whoever voters choose on Thursday – but that doesn’t mean he isn’t on their minds. One theme to emerge from the Guardian’s battleground dispatches is quite how many people have been turned off by Partygate. Efforts by local Conservatives to distance themselves from Johnson lead the print edition of the Guardian this morning. Take a look at this Hartlepool leaflet as an example: Political correspondent Aubrey Allegretti heard plenty about all this when he visited the London borough of Wandsworth, a flagship Tory council which is now a credible target for Labour. He recalls a conversation with one Conservative voter, who told him that “while [the party is] led by a man I don’t consider has integrity, I wouldn’t vote for them.” Aubrey thinks allegations of lockdown rule-breaking at No 10 could “contribute significantly” to how the Tories perform there. He said he was “quite surprised by how tactical some natural Tory voters are. They seemed ready to accept some short-term pain locally in exchange for what they see as the long-term gain of getting Johnson out.” Similarly, Heather Stewart’s piece yesterday from Worthing, West Sussex, feels like more evidence for Labour optimism in former Tory strongholds in the south. “I think [Partygate] may have an effect on turnout,” the Tories’ deputy council leader Edward Crouch told her. “Our voters don’t vote against us very often, they just stay at home and shout at the telly.” In many other parts of the country, Partygate appears to be actively motivating people in the opposite direction. “I’m voting Labour for the first time ever,” one voter in Bridgend told Steven Morris. “Every time I see Boris the buffoon, it makes me more sure. He’s lied and lied.” Do voters see Keir Starmer as a credible alternative? Unfortunately for Labour, there are quite a lot of voters feeling enthusiastically rude about Keir Starmer, too – or simply viewing him as a non-entity. “There’s a big poll lead nationally and we are getting a hearing again, but I’m still not sensing that love on the ground,” one Labour figure told Josh Halliday in Sunderland, where the party fears losing a council it’s held since its creation in 1974. Loretta Anthony, a 61-year-old Labour supporter in Bury, was pithier still in Jessica Elgot’s piece: “I’m sorry to say I don’t like the guy. We really need someone with a bit of backbone.” “It was striking that some longtime Labour supporters don’t think he’s opposing the government forcefully enough,” said Jessica, kindly breaking into a precious day off to speak to me, and only occasionally pausing to ask her toddler to please stop taking the leaves off a nearby bush. “And Keir Starmer as a person – it didn’t seem like people think about him as the barrister who’s taken on the Stephen Lawrence case, or McDonald’s – they think he’s some corporate lawyer.” Most predictions suggest Labour will make some progress – but, as Robert Ford wrote in the Observer, “The bulk of this year’s English contests are being fought on Labour’s strongest terrain – London and other big cities – meaning more seats to defend and fewer opportunities for gains.” Rather than seats, Jessica said, “the thing that’s interesting about places like Bury from a national perspective is vote share. If they can’t win parliamentary seats in Bury at the next general election, they may as well go home. It’s not a big headline, but gaining one or two councillors would indicate that they’re on course.” Who will lead opposition to the SNP in Scotland? If the dynamics in England and Wales seem complicated enough, consider the lot of the Guardian’s Scotland editor Severin Carrell. With every council seat north of the border in play, he’s sorting through the vagaries of the single transferrable vote system - which can lead to outcomes unthinkable in parts of the UK where votes for Labour and Conservatives are binary opposites. While the nuances in different parts of Scotland are vast, Severin says that “the most obvious single dynamic here is Labour against Tory – who is going to be top of the parties that are against the SNP”, the governing party which has endured a period of steady decline in the polls but remains first by a distance. “It improves Labour’s chances in Scotland that it jumps the hurdle of being electable at a UK level,” he said. “Working-class unionist swing voters may have jumped ship last time around because they didn’t believe that about Jeremy Corbyn.” As Severin set out in this piece, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has argued that at 27%, the party’s rough level of support in recent polls, a number of seats will come back into play in the next general election. For the Scottish Tories, whose leader Douglas Ross has “gone through really embarrassing contortions recently over the suitability of Boris Johnson to be PM”, the question is how many seats will they lose. The SNP, meanwhile, are insulated from serious harm: they underperformed in 2017, and can’t lose any of the councils they currently run. In summary, Severin said, “whatever happens probably isn’t going to change the political weather”. Will Northern Ireland get its first nationalist leader? In Northern Ireland, the vote is for members of the executive Stormont Assembly rather than councils. If polls are right, Ireland correspondent Rory Carroll says, Sinn Féin should emerge as the largest party – an outcome portrayed by the Democratic Unionist party as damaging for the union. “The Sinn Féin bogeyman is useful as a tool for the DUP to stop people turning to other unionist parties,” Rory said yesterday. “It’s worked in the past. The polling suggests that it won’t this time.” That’s part of why Sinn Féin’s leader in Northern Ireland Michelle O’Neill is taking a cautious approach on campaign messaging, as Rory explains in this piece. “Pro-union voters are not sufficiently scared to flock to the DUP because they mostly recognise there is no prospect of an Irish unity referendum in the short term,” Rory said. “And Sinn Féin have stopped talking about it themselves.” That’s not to underestimate the symbolic significance of a first Sinn Féin first minister – especially if the combined vote for all nationalist parties comes out ahead of unionist support. But Rory emphasises that it’s complicated: “Sinn Féin may make this pretty momentous breakthrough and yet actually lose seats, just because the DUP does worse,” he said, adding: “Good luck explaining that pithily.” Thanks Rory! (And if I’ve failed, do read his hugely interesting exploration of what the election might mean for unionism in the Observer.) The ten leading US feminists who give their responses to a new supreme court threat to abortion rights sound horrified, but not surprised.

Archie Football | Manchester City suffered a stunning defeat by Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final, conceding two late goals to force extra time before a penalty dumped them out of the competition.

Murray played down his chances, saying: “He’s the world No 1 and I’ve got a metal hip.” The Guardian’s print edition leads with “Tory candidates distance themselves from Johnson” while the other papers – very unusually – all have a different top story. Economics leads the Times – “We can cope with rising inflation, insists PM” – and it’s a similar theme in the FT: “Fed ramps up inflation battle with first half-point rate rise since 2000”. The Mirror splashes on anger over remarks by a Tory minister – “Let them eat cheap pasta” – and the i says “20 warnings missed to stop Covid slaughter in care homes claims”. The Mail bigs up Boris Johnson ahead of the local elections with its story “PM: Rwanda plan at risk from left-wing lawyers”, as does the Express with “Shackles off! PM to rid Britain of EU red tape”.

A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad Researchers from Cambridge University have developed a robot that can “taste” food in a way similar to humans. The robot has already been trained to make an omelette and has accurately tasted the salinity of scrambled eggs and tomatoes by simulating the chewing process. This might sound dystopian, but it’s also exciting: in a few years time these robots could help people cook at home, perhaps giving busy families the option to have their very own robotic sous chef.

5/5/2022,"The number of flying insects in Great Britain has plunged by almost 60% since 2004, according to a survey that counted splats on car registration plates. The scientists behind the survey said the drop was “terrifying”, as life on Earth depends on insects. The results from many thousands of journeys by members of the public in the summer of 2021 were compared with results from 2004. The fall was highest in England, at 65%, with Wales recording 55% fewer insects and Scotland 28%. With only two large surveys so far, the researchers said it was possible that those years were unusually good ones, or bad ones, for insects, potentially skewing the data, and so it was vital to repeat the analysis every year to build up a long-term trend. But the new results are consistent with other assessments of insect decline, including a car windscreen survey in rural Denmark that ran every year from 1997 to 2017 and found an 80% decline in abundance. Participants in the British survey downloaded an app, Bugs Matter, which enabled them to record their journeys and the number of bugs squashed on their registration plates. The next survey will run from June to August. “This vital study suggests that the number of flying insects is declining by an average of 34% per decade – this is terrifying,” said Matt Shardlow at Buglife, which ran the survey along with Kent Wildlife Trust (KWT). “We cannot put off action any longer, for the health and wellbeing of future generations this demands a political and a societal response. It is essential that we halt biodiversity decline now.” Paul Hadaway, at KWT, said: “The results should shock and concern us all. We are seeing declines in insects which reflect the enormous threats and loss of wildlife more broadly across the country. We need action for all our wildlife now by creating more and bigger areas of habitats, providing corridors through the landscape for wildlife and allowing nature space to recover.” Insects are critical in maintaining a healthy environment, by recycling organic matter, pollination and controlling pests. But scientists behind a recent volume of studies concluded they are undergoing a “frightening” global deterioration that is “tearing apart the tapestry of life”. A global scientific review in 2019 said widespread declines threatened to cause a “catastrophic collapse of nature’s ecosystems”. The new survey included almost 5,000 journeys made in 2021 and determined the “splat rate” for each, ie the number of insects recorded per mile. Wet days were excluded as rain might have washed some of the splatted insects off the plates. In the 2004 survey, which was conducted by the RSPB, only 8% of journeys failed to splat any insects at all. But in 2021, 40% of journeys did not record a single squashed bug. The possibility that newer vehicles were more aerodynamic and therefore hit fewer insects was ruled out by the data. The information gathered by the survey did not address why the decline was significantly lower in Scotland. But Shardlow said the factors known to harm insects, including habitat fragmentation, climate change, pesticides and light pollution, were less intense in Scotland. As well as demanding action from the government and councils, Buglife said people could help insects by not using pesticides, letting grass grow longer and sowing wildflowers in gardens. If every garden had a small patch for insects, collectively it would probably be the biggest area of wildlife habitat in the world, the group said.",News/Environment,"Flying insect numbers have plunged by 60% since 2004, GB survey finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/05/flying-insect-numbers-have-plunged-by-60-since-2004-gb-survey-finds
5/5/2022,"More than 40,000 Syrian children are out of school as a direct result of British aid cuts and more schools could soon close, a leading charity has said. British funding for 133 schools run by Syria Relief ended on 30 April, as the government cut its total foreign aid spending from its commitment of 0.7% of gross national income to 0.5%. “If funds are not found to plug the gaps left by the UK government and other donors, a generation of children in northern Syria will be out of school and this will lead to a close-to-immediate rise in child labour, child marriage, early pregnancies, child conscription to military and armed groups, child exploitation and child trafficking,” said Jessica Adams, head of communications for Syria Relief and its parent charity, Action For Humanity. “This was a political choice that we, and the children, parents and teachers of Syria, hope desperately will be reversed.” The details of the UK’s “rushed” £4.2bn spending cuts in 2021 were revealed in March, and it was Syria that received the harshest cuts, despite millions of people still living in refugee and displacement camps more than 10 years after the conflict began. Spending on Syria was slashed by 69%, including cuts to programmes on education, health, maternal health and Palestinian refugees. Syria Relief said it had been the largest non-government provider of schools in Syria, with 306 schools. But with other donors also reducing spending or redirecting aid to Ukraine, it currently supports 3,600 children in 24 remaining schools, which face closure by August, leaving a total of 100,000 children left without an education since 2021. The charity said the closures would defeat the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office’s stated goal of helping more girls into school and would push more girls into early marriages. “If this school closes we will have to send them to schools that ask for money, but we don’t have money, not even for rent, so we need the school to stay open,” said Abu Halid, whose children are at school in Mahmoodli camp for internally displaced people in northern Syria. According to Syria Relief, camp schools are overcrowded without electricity or heating. The charity said there are already high rates of child labour and early marriages among the war’s displaced people, which are likely to quickly increase if more schools are shut. “There are more than 2.4 million children out of school in Syria, and unless we significantly scale up our support, even more are at risk of dropping out. Rapid and substantial investments are now required to help us break the vicious cycle of suffering, violence and despair,” Joyce Msuya, assistant secretary general for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told the UN security council last week. The UN estimates 14.6 million Syrians are in need of humanitarian aid. The EU is hosting a conference next week aimed at encouraging donations and pushing for a resolution to the conflict.",News/Global development,"UK aid cuts have forced 40,000 Syrian children out of school, charity says",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/05/uk-aid-cuts-have-forced-40000-syrian-children-out-of-school-charity-says
