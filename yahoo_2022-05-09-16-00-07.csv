5/9/2022,"Donald Trump went on the attack in his Mother's Day message this year. He sent his wishes to the ""Very Unfair Radical Left Democrat Judges"" among others. He sent a similar message on Father's Day in 2021, to ""RINOs, and other Losers of the world."" Former President Trump issued an insult-laden message on Mother's Day this year, continuing his trend of releasing scathing statements on holidays. Trump published a post on Truth Social on Sunday, which Insider independently verified, bidding a ""Happy Mother's Day to all, including Racist, Vicious, Highly Partisan, Politically Motivated, and Very Unfair Radical Left Democrat Judges."" It wasn't just the judges Trump called out — he also highlighted the ""prosecutors, district attorneys, and attorney general"" who he said ""campaign unrelentingly"" against him ""without knowing a thing"" and who ""endlessly promise"" to take him down. ""After years of persecution,"" the message continues, ""even the Fake News says there's no case or, at best, it would be very hard to bring. Someday soon they will start fighting RECORD SETTING violent crime."" After the series of insults, Trump ended his message with an ""I love you all!"" At press time, Trump's post had been liked over 55,000 times and ""ReTruthed"" (the platform's version of a retweet) over 15,600 times. The statement appeared to be alluding to Trump's legal troubles; he's currently fighting a probe of the Trump Organization from New York Attorney General Letitia James. The former president has been fined $10,000 a day since April 26 after New York Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron held Trump in contempt of court for not complying with James' subpoenas for his records and documents. Trump now owes James more than $100,000 in fines and is appealing the contempt order. Trump has made a habit of sending out statements on such occasions that contain backhanded comments and insults. Last June, Trump issued a statement wishing a ""Happy Father's Day to all, including the Radical Left, RINOs, and other Losers of the world."" And in 2019, the then-president sent a tweet hitting out at his opponents on his way to golf with Sen. Lindsey Graham, per a report by The Hill, ""Happy Father's Day to all, including my worst and most vicious critics, of which there are fewer and fewer. This is a FANTASTIC time to be an American! KEEP AMERICA GREAT!"" read Trump's tweet, dated June 16, 2019.

5/9/2022,"Videos show workers at an Apple and Tesla plant in Shanghai clashing with quarantine officials. The workers were said to be frustrated with onsite COVID-19 measures. The clash underscores the frailty of Shanghai's plans to reopen its factories amid strict lockdowns. More than a hundred workers at a major Apple and Tesla production plant in Shanghai clashed with quarantine officials and security guards in a stunning altercation on Thursday, videos on Twitter and YouTube show. Workers at Quanta Shanghai Manufacturing City were filmed jumping over turnstiles, as officials in white protective gear tried to prevent them from breaching the building. Some workers exchanged physical blows with the guards. At one point, a female worker appeared to smack someone in protective gear so that a male worker, who was locked in a struggle with the person in protective gear, could get away. —自由亚洲电台 (@RFA_Chinese) May 6, 2022 The skirmish happened when officials prevented workers from heading back to their dormitories after completing their shifts, Bloomberg and Reuters reported. Anonymous interviewees said the workers were frustrated with onsite Covid restrictions, per Bloomberg. Some said that they were concerned about getting infected by workers who returned from quarantine centers, according to told Taiwanese news outlets USTV and UDN. They also feared that a spread of the virus on the factory floor would result in the campus going into a strict lockdown again, per the Taiwanese news reports. Quanta, Apple, and Tesla did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comments. The altercation underscores the fragility of Shanghai's attempts to get its factories up and running, even as large swathes of the 25-million-strong city have remained under strict lockdown for more than a month. In an attempt to minimize the lockdown's impact on Shanghai's economy, authorities have allowed some factories, including Tesla's gigafactory, to continue operating under a ""closed loop"" system where workers work, live, eat, and sleep onsite and at nearby dormitories. Taiwanese-owned Quanta produces three-quarters of Apple's MacBooks globally and assembles computer circuit boards for Tesla's cars. The Shanghai factory accounts for about 20% of Quanta's output for Apple, USTV reported. It also produces computer circuit boards for Tesla. On April 13, Quanta temporarily suspended operations in Shanghai to comply with local COVID-19 prevention measures. That prompted TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo to say that delivery of MacBook Pros would be delayed by three to five weeks. The factory gradually resumed operations starting April 18, with about 2,000 of its 40,000-person workforce returning to the plant, China's state media Xinhua reported. While news of the clash at Quanta's Shanghai factory spread on Twitter and YouTube, and was widely reported by Taiwanese media outlets, there was barely any mention of it on Chinese social media platforms and in Chinese media. According to the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, the city reported 3,625 asymptomatic Covid cases, 322 symptomatic cases, and 11 deaths on Sunday. Some of these patients worked at factories operating under a closed-loop system.

5/9/2022,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — More than three decades after a largely peaceful “People Power” revolt overthrew Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, his son and namesake is the top choice in most voter-preference surveys. Some of the major issues in Monday's vote: WHAT’S AT STAKE A triumph by Ferdinand Marcos Jr. would be a stunning reversal of the 1986 pro-democracy uprising that booted his father from office into global infamy. Many Filipinos aware of the human rights atrocities and plunder that unfolded under the elder Marcos dictatorship would likely push back against any perceived threat to democracy or attempt by Marcos Jr. to recover assets seized from his family as ill-gotten wealth. The election winner inherits immense problems, including an economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic, deeper poverty and unemployment, hyperinflation due to skyrocketing oil and gas prices, decades-old insurgencies and inflamed political divisions. He or she also may face calls to prosecute outgoing President Rodrigo Duterte for his bloody crackdown on illegal drugs. The International Criminal Court has been investigating the killings of thousands of mostly poor petty drug suspects as a possible crime against humanity. ___ FERDINAND MARCOS JR. A former provincial governor, congressman and senator, the 64-year-old son of the late dictator is making the most impressive attempt yet of the Marcos family to recapture the presidency. His mother, Imelda Marcos, twice unsuccessfully attempted to retake the seat of power after returning with her children to the Philippines from exile in the United States, where her husband died in 1989. Marcos Jr. has defended his father’s legacy and steadfastly refuses to apologize for and acknowledge the atrocities and plunder during the dictatorship. Married to a lawyer, with whom he has three sons, he has stayed away from controversies, including a past tax conviction and the Marcos family’s refusal to pay a huge estate tax. Throughout his campaign, he tenaciously stuck to a battle cry of national unity. He denies accusations that he financed a yearslong social media campaign that harnessed online trolls to smear opponents and whitewash the Marcos family’s checkered history, daring critics to “show me one.” ___ LENI ROBREDO As an economics student at the University of the Philippines in the 1980s, Leni Robredo joined the massive protests that led to the ouster of the elder Marcos. The 57-year-old also took up law and won a seat in the House of Representatives in 2013 in her first foray into politics after her husband, a respected politician, died in a plane crash in 2012. She defeated Marcos Jr. in the 2016 vice presidential race with a narrow margin in their first electoral faceoff. Her advocacies center on defending human rights and empowering the poor partly by teaching them their legal rights. The daughter of a trial court judge, Robredo does not belong to any of the prominent families that have dominated Philippine politics for generations, and is running as an independent propped by a network of campaign volunteers. As the opposition vice president, who was separately elected from Duterte, she condemned the killings of mostly poor drug suspects as part of his crackdown, angering the brash-talking leader and straining their ties for years. The mother of three has been cited for her integrity and a lifestyle that shuns the trappings of power — she used to regularly travel alone by bus to her home province as a congresswoman. ___ OTHER CONTENDERS Eight other presidential aspirants have lagged far behind in pre-elections surveys, including Manny Pacquiao, the 43-year-old former boxing star, who vowed to build houses for the poor and lock up corrupt politicians in a “mega-prison.” Manila Mayor Isko Moreno, a 47-year-old former TV heartthrob, banked on his rags-to-power life story and public awe over his massive cleanup of the capital. Sen. Panfilo Lacson, a 73-year-old former national police chief, has promised to continue exploiting his investigative skills to expose major government corruption. ___ SECURING THE VOTE Aside from the presidency, more than 18,000 government posts will be contested in the elections, including half of the 24-member Senate, more than 300 seats in the House of Representatives, as well as provincial and local offices across the archipelago of more than 109 million Filipinos. About 67 million are registered to cast their ballot. Voting will take place over 13 hours Monday, the one-hour extension intended to compensate for slower queues due to social distancing and other coronavirus safeguards. After voting centers close, thousands of counting machines around the country will send unofficial results to be tallied. A partial, unofficial count could reveal a clear winner within hours, but a close race could take longer. The official count and canvassing by Congress may take weeks. Thousands of police and military personnel have been deployed given longstanding risks posed by communist and Muslim rebels and a history of often bloody family and political rivalries in rural areas. In 2009, gunmen deployed by the family of southern Maguindanao province’s then-governor massacred 58 people, including 32 journalists, in an attack on an election convoy that shocked the world.",World/Associated Press,"Philippine election narrows to Marcos Jr., rights defender",https://news.yahoo.com/philippine-election-narrows-marcos-rights-042307587.html
5/9/2022,"Russia has scaled down its May 9 Victory Day military parade by almost 35%. Victory Day, which marks the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany, is meant to showcase Russian military strength. This year, the slimmed-down parade will show that Russia is aware of losses in Ukraine, per The Moscow Times. Russia has scaled down its May 9 Victory Day military parade by almost 35%, according to Forbes. The annual parade through Red Square, which marks the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in 1945, is usually a showpiece of Russian military power. But Forbes reported that this year's slimmed-down affair, due to take place on Monday, will more likely highlight the country's military weakness in Ukraine. There will be only 129 military vehicles and 10,000 personnel, compared to about 191 military vehicles and about 12,000 military personnel in 2021, according to information published by Russia's Defense Ministry, per The Moscow Times. The usual contingent of Rosvgardia forces will be absent, Forbes reported, as many are fighting in Ukraine. The number of Russian infantry fighting vehicles, or Kurganets-25, participating in the parade has been cut by 50%, the media outlet said. Fewer tanks will be on display, according to The Moscow Times, likely because Ukrainian has destroyed hundreds of them. Russia is presenting 15 helicopters for parade duty, down from 23 in 2021, after the loss of aircraft in Ukraine, Forbes reported. An expert told The Moscow Times that the scaling down is linked to Russia's military failings in the deadly invasion of Ukraine. ""The reduction of the parade shows that the Russian government is both aware of the losses [in Ukraine] and is trying to manage how to deal with them,"" said Aglaya Snetkov, an expert in Russian foreign policy at University College London, in an interview with The Moscow Times. Ukraine claims ""colossal"" Russian losses have taken place during their effort to fully capture the Donbas region. Numbers are difficult to verify, but some estimates have the Russian death toll since the start of the invasion at over 20,000. Western officials have suggested that the Kremlin might use the Victory Day parade to declare an all-out war on Ukraine or to announce general mobilization. Russia denies this. Any announcement comes at a time when Putin is seeking to double down on the Russian offensive, according to the CIA's director, Insider reported. And the Russian leader is expected to try to raise morale by using the ""Z"" wartime symbol at the parade and by making speeches drawing parallels between the Ukraine war and the defeat of Nazism, The Moscow Times said.
