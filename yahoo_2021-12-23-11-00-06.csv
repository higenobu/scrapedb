 Rep. Madison Cawthorn and his wife are divorcing after less than a year of marriage, with the North Carolina Republican citing his job in Congress as part of the reason for the split. ""When my wife Christina and I were engaged, I was not a member of Congress,"" Cawthorn, 26, said in a statement posted by his spokesman on Wednesday. ""I felt called to serve and we both agreed that I should run. Our victory was unprecedented. But overnight, our lives changed,"" the first-term lawmaker said. ""That change has been both hectic and difficult. It's neither the pace nor the lifestyle we had planned for,"" the lawmaker said. Cawthorn said he and his wife - who tied the knot in April - were ""committed to make things work,"" but the pair ""realized that balance was not attainable and that we had irreconcilable differences between us."" Eight months ago, Cawthorn celebrated his marriage, calling it the ""greatest honor, privilege and adventure"" of his life. ""While it was an enormously difficult decision, Christina and I have mutually decided to divorce,"" Cawthorn said on Wednesday. ""We ask for privacy as we work through this privately.""",U.S./The Hill,Rep. Madison Cawthorn and wife to divorce,https://news.yahoo.com/rep-madison-cawthorn-wife-divorce-001939084.html
12/23/2021,"An unexpected plus of a girlfriend sleepover: My bestie gave me a few pumps of magnesium oil to rub into my feet before getting into bed, and I drifted off, fast. I didn’t think much of it until a few days later when I had a massage and spied my bodyworker mix a few pumps of magnesium oil onto my neck and shoulders. Then, doing my wellness writer due diligence (i.e. searching social media), I discovered #magnesiumoil has more than 34,000 mentions on Instagram. What gives? I decided to investigate this sudden gusher of magnesium oil—while undertaking my own nightly pre-bed ritual at home. RELATED: I Spend Two Weeks Trying to Perfect My Sleep Routine, and I Highly Recommend You Do the Same Magnesium oil is oil that’s infused with micro-particles of flaked mineral magnesium, a bio-nutrient with widespread undiagnosed deficiencies in the population. According to a 2018 study in the medical journal Open Heart, due to processed foods, decreases in food crop nutrient levels, medications and chronic diseases, the vast majority of people in modern societies are at risk for magnesium deficiency, and this deficiency should be considered a public health crisis. (Move over Vitamin D.) That’s because magnesium is found in every cell in your body, and it plays a role in brain function, bowel movement, muscle movement, energy and sleep, according to sports nutritionist Shawn Wells. So, now that I have your attention, how do you make sure to have your recommended daily 310 milligrams of this important mineral? The best way, according to medical professionals (and it must be said, moms everywhere) is to eat your leafy green vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds. But that adds up to approximately 4 or 5 servings of freshly steamed spinach, baked potato with skin, edamame and…frankly I’m going to just come clean here and confess many days I maybe only get one serving. And while I don’t seem to have many of the early signs of profound magnesium deficiency, which according to the National Insitutes of Health are “non-specific and include loss of appetite, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and weakness,” let’s just say the condition is now on my radar. Besides pounding whole foods, you can supplement your dietary intake with popular nutrient drinks like Athletic Greens or Moon Juice Magnes-Om, but it’s the pre-bedtime foot rub I was curious about. There’s a home ritual that bath addicts such as myself have undertaken for years—soaking in a hot bathtub filled with Epsom salts, which are crystallized magnesium and sulfate that are named for the mineral springs in England where they were popularized. While it’s a home remedy for stress and muscular aches, has it ever been scientifically proven to absorb into the body’s tissue or bloodstream? Not according to the NIH. But still, I exercise, and I soak. Just like with transdermal absorption of magnesium flakes in water, there’s no scientific proof that magnesium oil rubbed onto the epidermis actually penetrates the skin. However, a 2017 NIH paper recommends further study of magnesium creams on a larger population than the small studies that have been done so far, since “magnesium might be able to get into the lymphatic system beneath the dermis and enter the circulatory system, bypassing the regulation through the GI tract and hereby increasing serum magnesium.” So, that’s a big “unclear” from the scientific community; however, my anecdotal use—massaging a couple pumps of oil on my feet before sleeping—has been a big win. Is it the relaxing manipulation of muscle that’s sending me to sleep fast? Or, as reflexology would explain it, am I sleeping better because I am releasing blocked chi? Am I just having a happy moment of self-care, so “centering myself” per all those meditation apps I’ve tried, then abandoned? The cause of my fast sleep isn’t so easy to pinpoint, but let’s just say my feet are more supple and soft than ever before thanks to the oil, and I’m sleeping like a baby. (A baby that’s getting all her magnesium.) Lavender and arnica oil make this smell good and super-power muscle aches.

12/23/2021,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — A California woman who punched a flight attendant in the face during a flight, breaking her teeth, pleaded guilty Wednesday to a federal charge, authorities said. Vyvianna Quinonez, 28, of Sacramento, entered a plea to interfering with a flight attendant, the U.S. attorney's office said. Quinonez was on a May 23 Southwest Airlines flight from Sacramento to San Diego when a flight attendant asked her to buckle her seatbelt, stow her tray table and wear her mask properly during the descent. Instead, Quinonez began recording the attendant on her cellphone, pushed her, then stood up and punched the woman in the face and grabbed her hair before other passengers intervened, authorities said. The assault was recorded on another passenger's cellphone. The plea agreement says that the flight attendant suffered three chipped teeth, two of which needed crowns, along with bruises and a cut under her left eye that needed stitches. “The flight attendant who was assaulted was simply doing her job to ensure the safety of all passengers aboard the plane,” acting United States Attorney Randy Grossman said in the statement. “It’s inexcusable for anyone to use violence on an airplane for any reason.” The incident marked an escalation in unruly behavior by airline passengers and led the president of the flight attendants’ union to ask for more federal air marshals on planes. Quinonez will be sentenced in March in San Diego federal court. She could face up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. However, prosecutors said they probably will recommend a sentence of four months in custody and six months of home confinement, KGTV-TV reported. Airlines reported more than 5,000 incidents of unruly passengers to the Federal Aviation Administration this year. Most of the incidents have involved passengers refusing to follow the federal requirement for passengers to wear face masks while on planes, but nearly 300 have involved intoxicated passengers, according to the FAA.",U.S./Associated Press,Californian pleads guilty to punching attendant on flight,https://news.yahoo.com/californian-pleads-guilty-punching-attendant-005148033.html
12/23/2021,"Let’s face it: We all know that drinking copious amounts of alcohol isn’t healthy or good for the body for a lot of reasons. Whether you have a little too much fun a few times a year and totally feel it the next morning, or you indulge in a few drinks during the week with minimal effects at all, you may be curious as to what your habits mean for your long-term health. Too many alcoholic drinks doesn’t just contribute to not-fun next-day effects like a raging hangover. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, excessive alcohol use can not only lead to alcohol abuse or dependence, it can also increase your chances of developing chronic conditions, including high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, certain cancers, liver disease and digestive issues, as well as a weakened immune system. It’s also tied to mental health conditions like depression and anxiety. Also, ignore the myth that your body recognizes different liquors differently. Your liver doesn't register a glass of wine any differently from a mixed cocktail—it only processes alcohol. If one drink has a higher ABV than the other, your liver will have to work harder. Both the short-term and long-term effects of drinking too much are likely enough to make you want to get your habits in check and get a better handle on what your limits are or should be. Here, a physician breaks down the alcohol metabolism process and how booze can be detected in your body. Alcohol metabolism is partially based on a person’s individual alcohol use habits as well as their genetic makeup, says Suneet Singh, MD, an emergency room physician and medical director of CareHive Health in Austin, Texas. According to Dr. Singh, the vast majority of the alcohol you drink is metabolized by your liver, while a very small amount is fully digested with no side effects. “The path alcohol takes from consumption to elimination involves a metabolism process that first starts in the stomach where various enzymes begin the overall breakdown cycle,” he explains. “Most of the alcohol passes unaltered into the small intestine where absorption into the bloodstream takes place, and upon reaching the bloodstream, alcohol is predominantly transported to the liver where over 90% of its metabolism occurs.” Once it reaches the liver, alcohol is is converted into a chemical called acetaldehyde, the substance responsible for the not-fun effects that can come with even small amounts of alcohol consumption, including headaches, nausea, and heart palpitations, explains Dr. Singh. “Generally speaking, one standard drink (i.e. 12 ounces or one can of beer, 5 ounces or one glass of wine, or 1.5 ounces or one shot of 80-proof distilled spirits) peaks in the bloodstream about one hour after consumption,” he explains. It takes about five half-lives to process and eliminate alcohol from your system completely, where the the half-life of alcohol tends to be about four to five hours, explains Dr. Singh. ""In turn, it takes about a day for the body to fully clear one serving of alcohol.” Thankfully, the physical symptoms of drinking alcohol and intoxication resolve much sooner than completion of the overall metabolism cycle, he says. If you’re concerned about how much alcohol is in your system because you have to drive yourself home or have work the next day, genetic factors, enzyme levels, alcohol quantity, and alcohol strength all play a role, into other factors such as age, body mass, and overall health as well as how it’s being tested, Dr. Singh says. In the blood for up to 12 hours On the breath for 12 to 24 hours In the urine for 12 to 72 hours In saliva for 12 to 48 hours, and In hair for up to 90 days According to Dr. Singh, both genetic and environmental factors contribute to these levels of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), two enzymes present in the liver that affect the rate of which your body metabolizes alcohol. “Studies have shown that males tend to have higher amounts of ADH than females, and people who consume alcohol regularly tend to have lower amounts of ADH compared to those who drink less often,” he says. “Research has also demonstrated that around 35-40% of people of East Asian descent have lower amounts of the ALDH compared to other ethnicities."" In short, the fewer alcohol metabolizing enzymes you have, the longer it takes for your body to metabolize alcohol—as well as more physical symptoms like nausea and headaches. How much you drink and how strong your alcohol of choice is also plays a role in metabolism and enzyme levels, with higher amounts unsurprisingly contributing to longer processing times, Dr. Singh says. The bottom line: How long it takes alcohol to clear your system, as well as how it can affect you physically, can easily vary by person. Take note of how you tend to feel after drinking any amount of alcohol and take steps to avoid those undesirable short-term effects, as well as the long-term effects that can come with too much alcohol consumption.
