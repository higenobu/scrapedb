5/1/2022,"Four years after Republicans embraced Donald Trump’s nativist and often racist playbook in an attempt to keep control of Congress, the party is once again placing the volatile politics of immigration at the center of its midterm election strategy. From the US-Mexico border to the US Capitol, in hearing rooms and courtrooms, Republicans are hammering the issue. At the forefront of the debate is a once-obscure public health order invoked by the Trump administration in March 2020 ostensibly as a means for controlling the spread of the coronavirus along the south-western border. Seizing on a decision by the Biden administration to lift such “Title 42” border restrictions, Republicans have sought to paint Democrats as pursuing an extremist immigration agenda that they say has cost the nation its very sovereignty. The provocative and often misleading messaging campaign was on full display when Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary of homeland security, testified on Capitol Hill. For more than eight hours, across two days, Republicans pelted Mayorkas with accusations and insults, demanding he accept the blame for what they described as dangerous and dire conditions along the 2,000-mile border with Mexico. “We’re all really border states now,” congressman Steve Chabot of Ohio said darkly. In another tense exchange, Ken Buck of Colorado said his constituents believed Mayorkas was guilty of treason and deserved to be impeached – something conservatives have vowed to pursue if they win the House. “What you have just said – it is so profoundly offensive on so many different levels, in so many different regards,” Mayorkas responded, visibly upset. Mayorkas forcefully defended the administration’s handling of the border and said it was up to Congress to act. “We inherited a broken and dismantled system that is already under strain,” Mayorkas said. “It is not built to manage the current levels and types of migratory flows. Only Congress can fix this.” The hearings laid bare the tensions within Democratic ranks over Biden’s immigration actions, particularly over Title 42. For months, immigration advocates and progressives have been pressuring Biden to lift Title 42, which gives officials the authority to swiftly expel migrants trying to enter the US instead of allowing them to seek asylum and remain in the country while their claim is evaluated. “You’re essentially doing policymaking by crisis,” said Claudia Flores, an immigration policy expert at the left-leaning Center for American Progress think tank. “And that’s just not effective.” As a matter of public policy, Flores said, it was dangerous to use a public health order to control immigration. Not only is the rule insufficient for addressing problems at the border, she added, but it has carried “grave humanitarian consequences” for asylum seekers. But some vulnerable Democrats have appealed to Biden to hold off on lifting the order, fearing it could be a political liability ahead of a difficult election cycle. Agreeing with Republicans, they have expressed concern that the administration lacks a comprehensive plan for dealing with the anticipated increase in migrants making asylum claims when the order is lifted in late May. “This is not good for Democrats in November,” Texas congressman Henry Cuellar, a Democrat facing a progressive challenge for his border-district seat, told Fox News Digital. “You know, in talking with some of my Republican colleagues, they’re saying, ‘We can’t believe the White House is giving us this narrative. We can’t believe that they’re hurting Democrat candidates for the November election.’” In his testimony, Mayorkas argued that his department had a plan to handle the expected surge of migrants. He repeatedly directed lawmakers to a six-point plan, released in advance of the hearings, that outlined a more aggressive effort to enforce immigration laws after the public health rule is lifted. It also included efforts to partner with nonprofits that help migrants in the US while their cases are processed and to work with countries across the region to address “root causes” of migration. “When the Title 42 public health order is lifted, we anticipate migration levels will increase, as smugglers will seek to take advantage of and profit from vulnerable migrants,” the memo stated. It did little to appease Republicans and some Democrats. “It’s clear to me that the federal government is not prepared – not even close,” Greg Stanton of Arizona, a border-state Democrat, said during the hearing. Biden has worked to reverse many hardline policies that were at the heart of Trump’s “zero tolerance” approach to immigration. The number of migrants attempting to cross the border has risen sharply. Biden has argued that the only way to address the migration is at the source – an ambitious plan that will probably take years to bear fruit. In the short term, his administration faces acute operational and political challenges. At a White House meeting last week, members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus urged the president to stand firm behind the decision to end the public health order. “Title 42 must end on 23 May,” California congresswoman Nanette Barragán, a deputy chair of the CHC, said she told the president, while urging him to “not support legislation to extend the end-date”. With the prospects of legislative action dim ahead of the midterms, the caucus is urging Biden to use his executive authority to make good on some of his promises to Latino voters on immigration, the environment, healthcare and the economy. They have argued that it is both good policy and good politics, as Latino support for Democrats is waning amid concern over the economy and inflation. “After four years of traumatic, xenophobic and inhumane immigration policies being forced on our most vulnerable communities, we have a duty to deliver them the protection and support they and their families so desperately need,” the Democratic congressman Adriano Espaillat, of New York, said after the meeting. Fears over Title 42 are only one element of the Republicans’ messaging. Republicans have sought to tie illegal immigration to other potent themes like voter fraud and crime. Allegations of undocumented migrants voting in large numbers have been repeatedly disproved. Studies have found that migrants commit crime at lower rates than native-born citizens. Republicans have long used immigration as a political weapon – with mixed results. In 2018, they lost the House in a wave election fueled in part by fury over Trump’s hardline policies that separated migrant children from their parents. The same year they expanded control in the Senate. The political winds have reversed. Republicans are heavily favored to take the House, and possibly the Senate. The national mood has soured on Biden and the Democrats as concerns over the economy and inflation deepen. But even as economic discontent dominates political debate, polling suggests immigration remains a pressing issue, particularly for Republicans. Four in 10 Americans, and nearly 70% of Republicans, say they worry a “great deal” about illegal immigration, according to a Gallup survey. During a tour of the border in Texas last week, the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, chided a reporter for asking about his false claim that he never urged Trump to resign after the January 6 insurrection – comments captured by an audio recording. “After all this, that’s what you want to ask?” he said. “I don’t think that’s what the American people are asking. I think they want to know about what’s going to happen here and how we’re going to secure the border.” Democrats blame Republicans for whipping up fear while standing in the way of reform. It has been almost a decade since Congress seriously considered immigration reform, a bipartisan plan that was derailed by House conservatives. “Let me tell you why our Republican colleagues don’t want to do their job – why they won’t work with us or vote for any of the bills that we have brought forward in the House,” Texas congresswoman Veronica Escobar said. “It’s because the status quo works for them.” “They love Title 42,” she said, arguing that it “helps them push this xenophobic rage machine that they believe will help them get elected and reelected”. It is unclear how the administration plans to proceed if a court rules it cannot lift Title 42. Biden declined to say whether he would sign legislation delaying the removal, which is under consideration by a bipartisan group in Congress. Vanessa Cardenas, deputy director of America’s Voice, a pro-immigration group, said Democrats must be more aggressive in defending their vision for reform. Keeping Title 42, she said, would not only play into Republicans’ hands, but would be a major disappointment to voters, particularly Latino voters who helped Democrats win in 2018 and 2020. “In an election season where margins matter, in states like Arizona, Nevada and Georgia, where the presence and the vote of the Latino community can make a difference, it’s really important that Democrats are able to articulate a vision that is in contrast to the other side,” Cardenas said. Referring to Trump’s hardline adviser, she added: “A Stephen Miller-Lite approach to immigration is not going to motivate the base.” ",News/US news,US Republicans return to politics of immigration as midterm strategy,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/01/republicans-politics-us-immigration-midterm-strategy
5/1/2022,"In these inflationary times when money is tight, are you preoccupied with rising – or dropping – house prices? First, take a deep breath. Or better still, don’t. Last week, we learned that almost every home in the UK suffers from air pollution above the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, according to the most detailed map of dirty air to date. Using the excellent addresspollution.org to check pollution levels at a click – produced by the Central Office of Public Interest (Copi), run by civic-minded creatives and makers of commercials – my house, or, rather, its position, minutes away from London’s south circular, has a percentile rating of 96 relative to other UK addresses, exceeding WHO guidelines by an alarming three times. Those levels will be similar to those found in many areas in cities across the UK: the air that urbanites breathe can promote cancer, cause asthma, trigger bronchitis and kill. Living on fresh air begins to take on a wholly benevolent meaning. Addresspollution.org, crowdfunded and launched nationwide in March 2021, uses data from Imperial College London to give the levels of particulate pollutants PM2.5 and PM10 and nitrogen dioxide, a toxic gas released when diesel, petrol and gas are burnt. Admirably, as a result of Copi’s efforts, it is now a legal obligation for estate agents, landlord and property owners to reveal the level of air pollution in a property. Copi wants tenants in heavily polluted areas to demand rent reductions, and some house sellers could see the value of their property plummet, as the urban exodus gathers pace (areas of the Lakes receive a breathtaking 12 and lower rating on the Copi website). Better still, properly restrict those industries profiting from pollution, assaulting the country’s lung capacity. Government’s unwillingness to do so, unsurprisingly, is nothing new. According to London Fog: The Biography, by the academic Christine L Corton, concerns were first raised in the 17th century. Later, since it was London’s East End that had the worst of the noxious fumes, that’s where the poor were forced to raise their children. After the First World War, the pulpit of St Paul’s was hidden in a blanket of fog, at the very moment when, ironically, the day’s reading was “I am the light of the world”. Only after the capital’s great killer fog of 1952 was the Clean Air Act (1956) passed and the smog lifted. Now, campaigners, local authorities and the pandemic have made us all more aware. In 2019, Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, brought in the ultra-low emission zone, reducing the number of the most polluting vehicles (but not enough). Eloquent Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, whose daughter, Ella, died aged nine in 2013, the coroner citing air pollution as a cause of death, has constantly spoken out. Government, she rightly says, is “failing the public”. Then, came the pandemic. In the space of two years, breathing has become a national concern. For the first time, on our television screens day after day, we have witnessed what it means to be short of breath: the invisible has become visible. Ventilation matters – but not when the open city window lets in a different potential killer. “When government fails,” says the Copi website, “we have to act.” How true.

5/1/2022,"When police in Washington DC burst into a fifth-floor apartment building on 22 April in search of a man who allegedly had shot four people at random, they found Raymond Spencer dead by his own hand, a cache of guns and ammunition, and a poster with an ironic white supremacist meme. The poster invoking the meme, popular on the extremist online forum 4chan, was a stark reminder that this attack blamed on Spencer, 23, was only the most recent mass casualty attack to spawn out of the ugly extremist culture of unregulated internet message boards such as 4chan. That particular forum gave birth to QAnon, the far-right conspiracy theory that Donald Trump is combating a cabal of leftist pedophiles, before it moved on to its even-more-extreme cousin 8chan. QAnon has been particularly effective in crafting the lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump, inspiring the Capitol riot on 6 January 2021. A bipartisan Senate committee connected seven deaths to the attack. Alek Minassian, 25, posted an update on Facebook with a direct reference to 4chan and its extreme misogynistic community of so-called incels, short for involuntary celibates, before launching a deadly vehicle ramming rampage in Toronto in 2018. And after New Zealand police arrested Brenton Tarrant, who shot and killed 51 worshippers in mosques in Christchurch, he cited 4chan and 8chan as direct influences. Seemingly by sheer luck, Spencer’s recent attack in Washington was less costly in terms of lives. But it was still a stark reminder of how many online extremists and the movements with which they sympathize can trace their origins to either 4chan or 8chan, said Oren Segal, vice-president of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. “The chans – 4chan, 8chan, etc – are some of the most vile places on the internet,” Segal told the Guardian. The trolling, humor, appeals to violence: it “seeps outside the confines of the message boards,” he added. Spencer’s case has chilling aspects. He fired 200 rounds from a makeshift sniper’s nest, injuring a man, two women, and a 12-year-old girl. He had an additional 800 rounds stashed. Just two minutes after the shooting began, someone under the username “Raymond Spencer” logged onto the normally-anonymous 4chan and started a new thread titled “shool [sic] shooting”. The newly published message contained a link – to a 30-second video of images captured from the digital scope of Spencer’s rifle. The clip streamed images and sounds of the barrage of bullets which slammed into cars and shattered windows at an adjacent school while also maiming four strangers. Even as police stormed the apartment building where Spencer hid, with officers maneuvering past a surveillance camera that he had set up in the hallway and was monitoring, Spencer continued to post to the message board. “They’re in the wrong part of the building right now searching,” he posted at one point. A few minutes later: “Waiting for police to catch up with me.” As he waited, Spencer logged on to Wikipedia to edit the entry for Edmund Burke School, which he had just opened fire on. “A basedman shot at the school on April 22, 2022,” the edit read, using a message board term derived from the word “based,” which is 4chan slang for somebody who agrees to the board’s warped worldview. “The suspect is still at large.” Police believe Spencer shot himself to death as officers breached his apartment. Like those who have carried out other domestic terror attacks that rocked the US, Canada and New Zealand in recent years, Spencer situated his mass shooting in a tangle of ironic memes and 4chan in-jokes. On a poster hanging in the apartment where Spencer died was a cartoon of a Black man with an enlarged head. It’s a deeply ironic reference to Nation of Islam theology – which holds that a Black scientist named Yakub created the white race more than 6,000 years ago. 4chan co-opted the concept more recently, caricaturing it along the way, to justify its own white supremacist philosophy. Anti-extremist groups such as the Southern Poverty Law Center have warned for years that 4chan and 8chan would continue inspiring domestic terror attacks. Cassie Miller, a researcher at the center, analyzed a self-selected survey of users to a white supremacist webforum. She found nearly 25% reported that they considered themselves radicalized – or, in their terms, “redpilled” – by the culture of 4chan and 8chan. It was tied for the single most-reported pathway to radicalization. While the far-right online ecosystem has grown significantly since then, the edgy humor and racist politics of ‘chan’ culture continue to prove influential, especially among younger users. The chans “normalize the kinds of narratives and grievances that are dangerous”, Segal said. They form a sort of “cheering section” for violence. Even 8chan’s founder, Frederick Brennan, has blamed the site for a rise in mass shootings and unsuccessfully called for it to be shut down. Brennan quit the site in 2016, leaving management to its new owners: Jim Watkins and his son Ron. The pair, who have since been identified as the likely puppet masters behind QAnon, have rejected more active moderation and have leveraged the site’s extreme free speech ethos for their own political ends – Ron Watkins is currently running in a Republican congressional primary in Arizona. There are few good solutions on how to address the radicalizing influence of these forums, Segal said. Owners like Watkins have been unwilling to crack down on hate speech; whenever one web hosting company has removed them, another has stepped up; and law enforcement is simply ill-suited to monitor and investigate the deluge of hate on the platforms. It will take a “whole-of-society approach”, Segal said. “Everything that normalizes hateful ideology … needs to be addressed.”",News/Technology,‘Cheering section’ for violence: the attacks that show 4chan is still a threat,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/01/4chan-extremist-online-forum-raymond-spencer
5/1/2022,"A supermarket rice magnate whose firm is based in the Middle East is one of the Conservative party’s major backers, donating through a foreign-owned company with millions of pounds of debt, the Observer can reveal. Karan Chanana, 49, the head of the global rice brand Amira, has donated more than £220,000 to the Conservative party through his British company Amira G Foods since September 2019. Chanana, who is originally from India, has Maltese citizenship and his firm Amira Nature Foods is domiciled in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) with its headquarters in Dubai. The latest donation of £50,000 was made in December, according to Electoral Commission records. London-based Amira G Foods says in company accounts it relies on funding from the BVI company Amira Nature Foods. The British firm had net liabilities of £5.96m on 31 March last year, according to its latest accounts. The donations highlight the lack of transparency on the ultimate source of corporate donations. Political parties are banned from accepting donations from foreign companies and individuals, but there have been longstanding concerns about the laxity of the rules. Companies are not required to disclose whether donations are sourced from foreign funds or UK revenues. Amira did not respond to questions last week about the donations, and its accounts do not disclose UK revenues. The Electoral Commission says it has urged the government to implement tighter controls to ensure foreign money is not being used to fund political parties. Under the current rules, a British-registered company is only required to be “carrying on business” in the UK to make political donations. Chanana hoped to transform the Indian food company Amira into the world’s leading rice brand. He turned a family business founded in 1915 into a major international producer of Indian speciality rice. The firm has specialised in Indian basmati rice, grown in the foothills of the Himalayas. Amira Nature Foods was listed on the New York stock exchange in October 2012 and its rice was sold around the world, including in British supermarkets. Chanana is chairman and chief executive of the company, and its principal shareholder. But its operations in India faced controversy in November 2020 when a complaint was filed with India’s Central Bureau of Investigation by a group of creditor banks which accused Amira Pure Foods, a group subsidiary in India, of defaulting on interest payments. It said accountants appointed by the banks found alleged “glaring irregularities” in its accounts. Banking officials involved in the complaints against Amira Pure Foods also filed an insolvency claim against the firm in India, and it is now under liquidation. Insolvency documents reveal that claims from financial creditors against the company are in excess of £230m. Amira Nature Foods was also delisted from the New York stock exchange in August 2020 after it missed deadlines for filing financial information. Its rice brands are no longer widely available in the UK. The company’s headquarters are in the 35-storey Gold Tower in Dubai, which has a cross-section in the shape of a gold leaf and gold-tinted windows. It also has a registered office in London. Chanana savoured the publicity as one of India’s most successful businessmen as he built his international food brand, regularly appearing in the media as a commentator. He has spent long periods in Britain while building his international business, giving the UK as his residence in company records, and regularly entertaining colleagues and friends in London. An Electoral Commission spokesperson said: “The commission has recommended for some time that the UK government and parliament consider, with us, how to improve the controls on donations and loans to prevent foreign money being used in UK politics. “We believe the law should change to prevent parties and campaigners from accepting money from companies that have not generated enough in the UK to fund the amount of their donation or loan.” The Conservative party, Chanana and Amira Nature Foods did not respond to a request for comment.",News/Politics,Rice magnate with Middle East-based firm revealed as major Tory donor ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/01/rice-magnate-with-middle-east-based-firm-revealed-as-major-tory-donor
5/1/2022,"Scrawled in looped handwriting among crates of candles in a walk-in storage cupboard, the pencil lines are still clearly visible on the wall at Audley End house. But for years, what – or who – the list in the 17th-century Essex mansion referred to was a mystery. Now the meaning has finally been unlocked, thanks to two Polish historians. They tracked 80 years of records and found that the list referred to six Polish special forces soldiers who trained at the grand Jacobean property during the second world war. The Cichociemni (the silent unseen) were a specially selected group of special operations paratroopers who were trained to drop behind enemy lines into occupied Poland to take on the Nazis. Audley End, then known as Station 43, acted as a finishing school for 527 of the elite soldiers who volunteered from Polish army units across the UK. English Heritage will mark the 80th anniversary of the launch of the programme on Sunday, with a new display of exhibits about Station 43, openingon 2 May, which includes documents, pictures and everyday objects adapted for concealing messages. Over more than two years, men trained at Audley End for three-month periods, doing assault courses over the River Cam as they learned underground warfare, but the graffitied names are one of very few visible signs left of the Cichociemni, along with the remains of a timetable stuck to a wall in a former briefing room and ammunition labels inside a laundry cupboard. The six men completed training on 12 April 1944. Dr Andrew Hann, an English Heritage historian, said the latest findings offer valuable insights into the lives of the soldiers who trained on the property. While he had known for a few years that the graffiti was there, “what we didn’t know was what it actually meant”. He added: “Then a couple of Polish historians came to look around, and my colleague, Peter, showed them into the cupboard. They said, ‘Ooh, I think we know what this is’.” After checking their records, they confirmed it was the names of the special forces paratrooper trainees, and Hann started researching them at the Polish Underground Movement Study Trust archive in Ealing, using Google Translate to interpret their personnel files. “It’s been a very slow process,” said Hann. But, he added: “It’s a lot more than we knew before, and it makes them into real people, real personalities, rather than just a list of names.” The six men identified performed some extraordinary feats. Franciszek Socha, who was 29 when he finished training, was a teacher who studied at Lviv university and appeared to be the group’s star student. During one mission, he was parachuted into northern France to obtain a specimen of poison gas, but was captured by the Gestapo. He managed to escape by jumping off a moving train and, with the help of the local resistance, made his way to a British submarine. Jan Benedykt Różycki, then 43, was a former civil engineer from Klimkiewiczów who spoke five languages fluently. He parachuted back into Poland to deliver supplies to the Polish army. Other Cichociemni were hunted down under the postwar Soviet regime, but he stayed. In 1949, he was arrested on false charges and imprisoned for three years, and his son was killed while trying to free him. Eventually, he became director of the Polish Institute of Civil Engineering and died in 1991. The others included Teodor Paschke, 29, from Chodecz, an officer in the prewar Polish army who became a trainer at Audley End, Jósef Zbrzeźniak, 22, a printing company courier from Warsaw who fought in Italy, Karol Dorwski, 38, a prominent film and theatre actor from Lviv who starred in several prewar movies, and Czesław Migoś, 23, a sergeant in the artillery who escaped Poland and joined Polish forces in France before being posted to Britain. However, the mystery over the reason for the list – and why some of the names are crossed out – remains. Suggestions include a record of borrowing rubber boots or those who have passed certain courses, but there is no definitive answer. “It’s one of those mysteries we will probably never discover. But what was really exciting is that they’re such varied types of people with interesting backstories,” said Hann, adding: “They’re all obviously coming together with a common purpose to fight for their homeland and pushing themselves into the potentially very dangerous situation of being parachuted back into Poland.” The underground warfare course consisted of training in sabotage, field craft, reconnaissance and specialist training in disciplines such as microphotography and wireless operation. During the final stage, before being sent out into the field, soldiers would be briefed on the latest information about Poland, and invent aliases and false identities, as well as being given clothes and false documents. Such was the detail that they would even have their dentistry checked to ensure it was in keeping with their destination, so they would not be found out.",News/World news,Polish historians solve 80-year mystery of wartime graffiti at Essex mansion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/01/polish-historians-solve-80-year-mystery-of-wartime-graffiti-at-essex-mansion
5/1/2022,"In 2002, I accessed the 3,000-year-old subterranean ceremonial chamber of Pendeen Fogou in north-west Cornwall, by crawling through a 2ft-deep river of liquid cow slurry. Once inside, I was transformed and it was worth it. On Wednesday, I crawled through filth again, as I tried to read the Daily Mail as research for this column. But, unlike my Pendeen Fogou epiphany, the experience provoked only nausea. What a week in British politics it’s been! The multifaceted transport secretary, Grant Shapps, historically manifests himself in many different identities. On Monday, as Grant Shapps, he addressed Brexit Britain by video on the benefits of Brexit, while bestriding a ride-on lawnmower. “Now thanks to Brexit,” Shapps boasted, snake-oil style, “we’ve been able to ditch the Vnuk law” (requiring car insurance to also cover ride-on lawnmowers and golf buggies). “And in these difficult financial times,” Shapps concluded, as if the difficult financial times were nothing to do with him and his party, “that’s going to help the average motorist save about 50 quid.” This, of course, more than makes up for the Office for Budget Responsibility’s estimated 4% Brexit hit to the UK economy over the next 15 years. Ride-on lawnmowers are free! But until all ride-on home-horticulture vehicles are free this Brexit bonus will ring hollow! Typically, the EU had already repealed the Vnuk law during the Brexit transition phase anyway, while we neglected to do so. At least when creating fake online reviews for his businesses Shapps used to hide behind implausible pseudonyms – Michael Green, Sebastian Fox or Corinne Stockheath. (Corinne Stockheath is a name that never existed anywhere outside Shapps’s fecund imagination, although it seems you can now follow her on Twitter). Next time Shapps bestrides a ride-on lawnmower to fib about Brexit and ride-on lawnmowers, he should do it as one of his made-up identities. The ride-on lawnmower is the choice mode of transport for Corinne Stockheath, apparently. “Perhaps the grass can be just a little bit greener,” Shapps soliloquised in closing like a stupid arse, before ride-on lawnmowering off into the sunset. Perhaps the grass can be greener, Grant, but not on the roadside verges of Kent, where backed-up lorry drivers have made the green grass all yellow. And brown. Because of Brexit. Indeed, transport select committee chairman, Huw Merriman MP, recently stepped in human excrement while on a fact-finding mission to a Kent lay-by. Hopefully, this gave him some idea of the benefits of Brexit. And how those stranded lorry drivers must envy the speed at which Shapps’s ride-on lawnmower is able to travel. Cramped in their stationary cabs at night they dream of doing two miles an hour in a field on a ride-on lawnmower, mowing away the letters Vnuk in a heavy-handed Brexit metaphor as inane as it is dishonest. Is this the best you’ve got, Brexiters? A £50 reduction on ride-on lawnmower insurance that the EU had already scrapped anyway? Ah well. It will now be cheaper to trim the grass of the sunlit uplands. Perhaps Corinne Stockheath could get on with mowing the lawns while Shapps himself concentrates on scraping the barrels. It’s Wednesday morning. A quarter of a century ago, I made the mistake of getting out of a Jeep in the Lake Bonney Riverlands of South Australia, and suddenly every square centimetre of my face and body was covered in swarming black flies. That’s what the news feels like now: so many sick stories coming at you all at once. What is it you want me to satirise this week, liberals of Observer-land? Brexit-supporting holidaymakers incensed by passport controls they voted for? Or Nadine Dorries’s downstreamed tennis pitch dyslexia? Covid cash millions in disappearing suitcases? Or billions wasted on contracted cronies? Sexual misconduct in the cabinet? Or frontbench porn from the internet? Broken replacement red wall funding promises? Or the end of educational Erasmus opportunities? Raw sewage discharging or more fines for partying? Lawnmower insurance dividends or government human trafficking? Channel 4 cultural vandalism or care home Covid scandalism. Which of these news flies to swat first? Answer me! I stumble around Southend-on-Sea, where I worked the night before, looking at newspapers in shops. I can see from the front of the Daily Mail that the disappointing Dan Hodges is squatting splay-thighed on his milking stool, desperately tugging the last squits of black poison from the dry udders of Angela Rayner’s Leg-Gate story like a zombie farmhand. For money. I know that if I were to read the Mail’s Leg-Gate coverage I’d get 1,000 words from it, but that means either visiting the Daily Mail website or buying a physical copy, both of which help the horrible paper, and so are not morally acceptable options. It’s 12.15pm. I go into M&S to buy my usual lunch: a 120g tray of British coronation chicken slices and some egg mayonnaise. In the queue, I browse the newspaper rack’s Daily Mail for free. I get stuck into a double spread that purports to prove Rayner found her sexual objectification delightful via an old interview that actually proves the exact opposite. But suddenly it’s time for me to scan my proteins. Thinking on my feet, I do the only moral thing and slip the Daily Mail into my bag unpaid for. I sat on the clifftop with my chicken products and my stolen Daily Mail. Maybe it was all the egg mayonnaise, but after the first couple of pages, I vomited slightly into my mouth, so I put the Daily Mail in a dog excrement bin and decided to run with the ride-on lawnmowers. These people only want you to talk about them anyway. Life’s too short to put yourself through that kind of shit.

Robert Icke’s five-star reimagining of Arthur Schnitzler’s Professor Bernhardi, staged at the Almeida in 2019 with Juliet Stevenson, is finally getting a West End transfer in September. But here’s a chance to stream his version for Internationaal Theater Amsterdam, where Icke is a resident director. Janni Goslinga plays the Jewish doctor who clashes with a priest, causing a public storm, in a production that explores medical ethics and identity politics. Livestream on 22 May (Dutch language with English subtitles). Amanda Wilkin’s solo show announced her not just as a writer of indelible scenes but a performer of abundant warmth. She is superb as Londoner Myah, with twin habits of shrinking away and over-sharing, who, in a knockout opening sequence, grimaces through her office’s diversity photoshoot. Themes of shame and togetherness are threaded through a drama that takes her from a break-up to a rewarding relationship with flatmate, Mildred, an elder from the Windrush generation. Rosanna Vize’s spare but striking set frames the story perfectly. Available until 8 May. Read the review. This year she has already won an Olivier award for Cabaret, picked up an Oscar nomination for The Lost Daughter and released an album with Bernard Butler. But here’s a flashback to one of Jessie Buckley’s earlier achievements, when she played Miranda opposite Roger Allam as Prospero. This 2013 production, directed by Jeremy Herrin and also featuring Colin Morgan, is one of the latest to be added to the online archive of Shakespeare’s Globe. Also newly available on GlobePlayer are All’s Well That Ends Well (2011) and The Merry Wives of Windsor (2010). Read the review. Marquee TV has a huge collection of prestigious theatre, dance and opera productions featuring UK household names but its newest intriguing addition is Irena Stetsenko’s documentary about Ukraine’s seven-strong, all-female cabaret outfit the Dakh Daughters. It unfolds during the 2014 Maidan revolution, in dressing rooms and on the road, charting the group’s acts of creation at a time of protest and chaos. Dance for Ukraine, the recent charity ballet gala presented by Ivan Putrov and Alina Cojocaru, is also available from Marquee TV, but only until 2 May – so leap to it. In Michael Longhurst’s inspired West End revival of Nick Payne’s two-hander Constellations, four pairs of actors took turns to play a couple whose relationship is set against the backdrop of quantum multiverse theory. Longhurst and one of those stars, the supreme Sheila Atim, won Olivier awards in March. You can watch all four versions on demand from the Donmar until 25 May: Atim performs with Ivanno Jeremiah and the three other pairings are equally enticing: Peter Capaldi and Zoë Wanamaker, Omari Douglas and Russell Tovey, and Anna Maxwell Martin and Chris O’Dowd.

The Waves is a series of five audio dramas, each lasting 25 minutes, exploring how Britain’s colonial past is felt today in the home towns of five writers: Danielle Fahiya, Corinne Walker, Stefanie Reynolds, Erinn Dhesi, Danielle Fahiya. Mostly recorded on location, they tell tales about a beauty pageant, an apartment in a former cotton factory and a Hibs football match. Mike Bartlett’s Restoration riff Scandaltown has revived the fine art of comical character names with its tale of Lady Susan Climber and co. The rollicking London Assurance, written by Dion Boucicault in 1841, gave us the unforgettable Sir Harcourt Courtly and Lady Gay Spanker – played to perfection by Simon Russell Beale and Fiona Shaw in Nicholas Hytner’s 2010 revival, one of the recent additions to the National Theatre at Home archive.

5/1/2022,"On Friday 8 January 2021, Twitter kicked Donald Trump off its platform and an eerie calm enveloped parts of our global public sphere. Depriving him of his online megaphone was a compelling demonstration of how a tech platform had acquired an awesome power – the ability effectively to silence an elected president. But what kind of power is it really? Many years ago, in a landmark book, Power: A Radical View, the sociologist Steven Lukes wrote that power comes in three varieties: the ability to stop people doing what they want to do; the ability to compel them to do what they don’t want to do; and the ability to shape the way they think. This third capability is clearly the kind of power that a society’s communications media wield. But until Trump arrived on the scene, Twitter didn’t look like a particularly powerful player. It’s a midget compared with giants such as Facebook and YouTube – 217 million daily users compared with Facebook’s 1.96 billion, for example. And, as any local politician knows from doorstep canvassing, very few “ordinary” citizens use it. So wherein lies its importance? Answer: virtually every mainstream journalist is an obsessive user of it. And mainstream media – print and broadcast – outlets are still the forces that shape how citizens perceive the world. Trump understood this intuitively. For five years, he used Twitter to dictate the day’s news agenda. And once elected, he, in effect, governed through Twitter – to the extent that some genius created a bot that reformatted every tweet of his into an official-looking White House statement. Elon Musk is the only businessman to date who has demonstrated the same intuitive grasp of the medium and he has used Twitter with the same Trump-like flair – to keep his mob of 83 million followers energised, amused and outraged; to manipulate a range of markets, including those involving cryptocurrencies; to sell cars (more than 300,000 in the past three months, without having a marketing division); and to troll public authorities. Now this uber-troll has decided to acquire his favourite platform. Like Victor Kiam, the guy who liked Remington shavers so much that he bought the company, Musk likes free speech so much that he’s gone and bought it! This might have something to do with the fact that one of the public authorities he’s been trolling is the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which previously fined him for claiming (on Twitter) that he had the funds to take Tesla private and required him to have any further business-related tweets vetted by a lawyer (famously dubbed a “Twitter-sitter”) before posting. Whatever the explanation, Musk now declares himself to be a “free speech absolutist”. He doesn’t, however, seem to have done much thinking about what would actually be involved in running a platform based on absolutist principles. As the FT’s John Thornhill put it: “He grandly declares that maximal free speech reduces civilisational risk. Cue widespread applause. But back in the day, Twitter also described itself as ‘the free speech wing of the free speech party’. Then it collided with porn bots, cyberbullies and terrorist extremists. ‘We have tried that. It did not work, Elon,’ says a former Twitter executive.” Musk suffers from the delusion that “Twitter has become the de-facto town square”, which, frankly, is baloney. The internet, as Mike Masnick points out, is the metaphorical “town square”. Twitter is just one small private shop in that space – a shop in which hyperventilating elites, trolls, journalists and millions of bots hang out and fight with one another. He also seems to have forgotten that Twitter operates outside the first-amendment-obsessed US – in Europe, for example. Last Tuesday, Thierry Breton, the EU’s commissioner for the internal market, warned that Twitter must follow European rules on moderating illegal and harmful content online, even after it goes private. “We welcome everyone,” said Breton. “We are open but on our conditions… ‘Elon, there are rules. You are welcome but these are our rules. It’s not your rules which will apply here.’” Since Musk seems temperamentally allergic to rules imposed by governmental agencies, Twitter under his command should have interesting challenges ahead in Europe. But the part of the world where he would have most difficulty is China. Up to now, Twitter has had a pretty good record in resisting bullying by Xi Jinping’s regime. Ever since the Hong Kong democracy movement triggered a massive counterattack by Xi’s trolls on foreign social media, Twitter has removed thousands of Chinese accounts and slapped labels on state media tweets; stopped taking advertising from Chinese government stooges; and declined to cooperate with regime requests. The platform also provides a global platform for Xi’s critics. China’s new national security law explicitly targets seditious speech, including on overseas platforms, but Twitter, to date, has not cooperated. This admirable commitment to free speech would produce exquisite and perhaps unbearable pain for its new proprietor. Tesla, which, after all, is his main gig, produces half of its cars in China and earns a quarter of its revenues there. As Reuters points out: “China could easily hold Tesla to ransom if a Musk-owned Twitter didn’t play ball.” It could, which is why one wonders if, in the end, Musk will just walk away from the acquisition. He’s a businessman, after all, and businessmen supposedly believe in the primacy of markets. He embarked on this venture thinking that the rules of free speech are just another asset available for purchase in the “marketplace of ideas”. With a bit of luck, he will come to the conclusion that the price is much higher than he envisaged. In which case, those of us who believe that those rules should be determined by democratic institutions can breathe again.

5/1/2022,"David Eldridge is an acclaimed dramatist and screenwriter. Born in Romford, where his father was a shoemaker, his plays include Market Boy, In Basildon and an adaptation of Thomas Vinterberg’s film Festen. His new play, Middle, is at the National Theatre, the second in a trilogy of dramas about couples that began in 2017 with the West End hit Beginning. He has three sons, lives in north London, and attends every West Ham home game. Was Beginning always going to be the first part of a trilogy?No. But on the night of its third preview, it suddenly occurred to me I could write a sequel, catching a couple who were 10 years older than the pair in Beginning, and who might be at a crossroads in their relationship. I’ve learned over the years that if I have an idea that won’t go away, I should listen to it, but I was also sensible enough to not even think about going down that road unless I had an idea for a third play [to be called, inevitably, End]. I brooded and brooded, and when I finally did [have an idea], I remember thinking: thank God. But you chose not to stick with the same characters. Why?I thought that would be the less interesting route. I hoped that in telling the stories of three different couples, I might be able to say something bigger about what it means to be with someone, about loneliness, about whether progress as a couple is ever really possible. What’s it like rehearsing with a cast of only two?It’s about trust: the trust they feel in each other, and in us. We’re all trying to find an empathy for the characters, to help Claire [Rushbrook] and Daniel [Ryan] play them in a truthful, detailed way, and this means that everyone in the room, including stage management and the choreographer, ends up sharing their own experiences. Polly Findlay [the play’s director] talks of the Eldridge iceberg. There’s the obvious subtext, and then there’s what Ted Hughes used to call the “hidden-most”: the really deep stuff of which not even the characters are aware. Your work is intimate, and often interested in family dynamics. Do you feel too much theatre now is determined only to tackle big political and historical issues?I’m not hopping over the question, but it was ever thus. I think of my first play in 1996: I was 22. I was part of a generation of playwrights that were regarded as in-your-face: Jez Butterworth, Sarah Kane, Joe Penhall. A year later, along came Conor McPherson’s The Weir. It was the best play of the past 10 years, and it was counter to everything then current. One byproduct of getting older is a sense of perspective. What I can say, though, is that Middle wasn’t written as a response to anything else. What’s important to me is to move people. John Osborne said he wanted to give lessons in feeling. That’s always struck a chord with me. You’re relatively productive for a playwright. What’s your secret? Does making plays get easier?No, it’s always terrifying to deliver a play, and I feel more and more responsibility to make work that is good and worthwhile. It still feels massive to me. But you need an insouciance, too. To write well for actors, you want it to feel like it lives on the moment. It’s a weird, contradictory energy. When did you discover the theatre?The first play I ever saw was King Lear, at 17. I got taken to the RSC’s production starring John Wood. It was an A-level set text, but half of us hadn’t read it yet; we were going to get into it in the upper sixth. I had a terrible adolescent attitude to it. I said to my friend Angus: “Shakespeare? Boring.” Angus said: “Don’t worry, there’s a good bit in the middle where someone gets their eyes pulled out.” But by the time we emerged for the interval, I could not believe what I was seeing. The icing on the cake was that, at the end, I was expecting Lear to be holding Cordelia’s hand, and he was carrying her body! It was mind-blowing. It changed my life. You won a scholarship to a public school [Brentford School, in Essex]. What do you feel about that now?It didn’t make for a very happy adolescence. But perhaps most people feel like that, and the education I got was great. It’s interesting, thinking about what happens notionally when you move out of one class bracket into another. The best class story that gets told in our family is from when I was a kid. My uncle John and his wife, Irene, did well out of the 80s. He had a garage; she did that quintessentially Thatcherite thing of setting up her own small cleaning business. They lived round the corner, but in a nicer house than ours. One day, my uncle came round. My dad was having bread and jam for breakfast. I remember seeing my dad walk out of the back door and into the garden. He’d offered my uncle some bread and jam, and my uncle had said: “I don’t like bread and jam, it reminds me of being poor.” I’m not dissing my uncle. I love him, and I’m in this territory myself now. Do you still feel not enough working-class voices are heard in the theatre?I can’t complain personally. I’ve made plays like In Basildon. We did put a play set in Romford Market on the Olivier Stage at the National Theatre. I’ve given blue-collar voices a Chekhovian form. But I do still feel it, in quite a raw way, when I talk to younger writers. Playwrights who are not from a middle-class background often feel they are being patronised by the development culture. The script editor will be middle-class, and doesn’t necessarily understand their world. In recent months, you’ve lost both your mother and your great mentor and friend, the playwright Robert Holman. Is it hard, bringing a play to the stage without them behind you?I always used to love seeing Mum and Dad at the theatre together. When something connects with my family, it’s a great feeling. I wrote a version of Ibsen’s The Wild Duck, and my sister was sitting behind me during it, and just before the interval, when the penny was starting to drop, I heard her say to her husband: ‘He’s the father isn’t he? He’s the fucking father!” She was so caught up in it. It was the best thing that had ever happened. My mum’s no longer part of that constellation now, and it’s a blow. I was on the phone to my dad the other day, talking about when he’s going to come and see Middle. I said: “Do you want me to take you? Or Fay [Eldridge’s sister]? Or your mate Ray?” It is going to feel weird without mum. With Robert, it was strange, walking through the park on the first day of rehearsals. For the past 23 years, on every first day of a play of mine, he has always rung me. He was like dad number two to me. Which do you see more often: football, or theatre?Since the pandemic, I’ve only seen one play: The Normal Heart [Larry Kramer’s Aids drama, at the National Theatre]. My son, George, was born in 2020, and from last summer, we knew Mum was on the way out, so it has been difficult. I suppose West Ham is my main thing… I have a season ticket with my brother. Sometimes we take Dad, sometimes I take my older son, or my nephew. Sometimes it’s no kids, and we have pizza and a few beers and bring a mate. Is football a kind of theatre?People say that, but I’m not sure – though in the sense that it’s about the day, not just the match, maybe it is a bit like an experiential thing by Punchdrunk. Middle is at the National Theatre, London SE1 until 18 June",Arts/Stage,Playwright David Eldridge: ‘What’s important to me is to move people’,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/01/playwright-david-eldridge-whats-important-to-me-is-to-move-people
5/1/2022,"Margo Jefferson is the rare memoirist who is always daring the reader to keep up. She’d rather recall her fleeting impressions instead of recounting a scene and the sheer volume of her allusions to 20th-century Americana – she worked for years on the culture desk of the New York Times – casts an instant spell. In her 2015 book, Negroland, she found a form that held together a portrait of her childhood in a rarefied black enclave in 1950s Chicago, and her early encounters with feminism as a young woman in New York, interspersed with musings on Little Women, James Baldwin and The Ed Sullivan Show. The book was alternately categorised as social history and memoir. The typical Jefferson paragraph, zigzagging through different perspectives, freely borrowing and repurposing other writers’ sentences and song lyrics, invariably reminds me of something one character tells another in Italo Calvino’s 1972 novel Invisible Cities: “It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear.” Constructing a Nervous System begins with Jefferson reporting a bad dream: she is alone on a stage and “I extended my arm – no, flung, hurled it out – pointed an accusatory finger” at herself. You sense straight away that Jefferson’s intention is not to tell a story, but to relay an inner tempest on the page. In the next few pages, she quotes from a letter she wrote in 2018 to her dead mother, rewrites lines from an Ethel Waters song and confesses to secretly idolising mid-century black male singers because of their “immersive lure of danger and dominance”. She bristles at classifying these mental leaps as either criticism (“too graciously incantatory”) or memoir (“commemoratively grand”): “Call it temperamental autobiography.” Jefferson’s formal ambition is akin to that of the “essay film” – I’m thinking here of Chris Marker’s Sans Soleil (1982) and Orson Welles’s F for Fake (1973) – where the need to simultaneously convey one’s adrift thoughts and inmost exigencies produces a marvellous density. Her project is, on the one hand, aggressively public spirited: a resettling of “American culture”, in her words. She explores how her artistic sensibility was shaped by an imaginative affinity with those who “won’t imagine you”: white novelists who were condescending or indifferent to black women (Willa Cather, Margaret Mitchell), black showmen with a history of abuse or apathy towards their female counterparts (Ike Turner, Bud Powell). But the terms of Jefferson’s inquiry are personal. Just as Negroland was inflected with the tragedy of losing the milieu of her childhood, after the death of her mother, Constructing a Nervous System is haunted by the memory of Jefferson’s older sister, Denise, a dancer who died in 2010. You can picture Denise in the room when Jefferson recalls watching Ella Fitzgerald sweat through her TV appearances in the 1960s or while describing her teenage impressions of Gone With the Wind: “We feared so many things, Denise and I. We knew they were lesser things. They didn’t belong to the world of slavery. They belonged to the world of cautious privilege-parsing equality.” Decades later, Jefferson is unsure about the privilege-parsing equality of her adolescence. She imagines an alternative ending to the gratuitous climax of Uncle Tom’s Cabin; she rephrases the well-known opening paragraph of Janet Malcolm’s The Journalist and the Murderer to come up with a credo for critics. Black female athletes arouse a strange defensiveness in Jefferson, for she realises that she has “never worked as hard at anything” as the athletes have through their formative years. In one of the book’s more delicate moments, Jefferson finds herself pitying Condoleezza Rice, who served as the US secretary of state during George W Bush’s presidency and was an advocate of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Describing her working relationship with Bush, Rice once remarked that she was “internalising his world”. Jefferson recognises a similar impulse in her own obsession with white celebrities, her preoccupation with the sense of entitlement unavailable to her as a black woman in the US. “They were models I could imitate, adapt or make a point of rejecting,” she writes. Jefferson says she feels disappointed “in a lifetime of reading white writers” by their incuriosity about black Americans. I share that disappointment, because I too have experienced something similar while reading contemporary American writers. Even as you are thrilled by Jefferson’s admissions and ambivalences, and taken in by the range of her whims and passions, you can’t help but wonder why it is just “American culture” that she wants to resettle, why her attention to the ways in which whiteness corrupts with the “expedient innocence of privilege” doesn’t take into account the fact that American omniscient narrators, both white and non-white, in fiction as well as nonfiction, repeatedly fail to acknowledge the existence of lives outside their country’s borders. Much like the younger Jefferson, the non-American reader must learn to imagine someone who “won’t imagine you”. Jefferson riffs on WEB Du Bois’s landmark 1903 text The Souls of Black Folk, but Du Bois’s invocation of “double consciousness” was laced with the sense of a world beyond the Atlantic Ocean and he frequently expressed solidarity with anti-colonial struggles elsewhere. These days, many non-white American writers protest against domestic injustices, but they rarely breach the solipsism of empires. Then again, if Jefferson were more worldly – less provincially American – perhaps she wouldn’t have been as attuned to the difference between the token black female characters in Gone With the Wind and Uncle Tom’s Cabin or retained the ability to equally appreciate Erroll Garner’s blithe exuberance and Bud Powell’s darker melodies. It is impossible not to be stirred by her odes to fellow black American strivers of excellence, their determination to “prove our value to the world”.

5/1/2022,"Our Changing Planet (BBC One) | iPlayerPiers Morgan Uncensored TalkTVGrace ITV | ITV HubTen Percent Amazon Prime Sometimes you get weeks on television that feel like a rapturous celebration of humankind. Other times, it’s like a bingo card of human horror: stupidity (tick); complacency (yup); greed (got it); imminent self-made global destruction. Full house! So it comes to BBC One’s two-part climate emergency documentary Our Changing Planet, an ambitious, unprecedented, multi-location eco-research mission, during which regions and projects will be revisited over the course of seven years by the same six conservationist-spirited presenters. And so it unfolds, with the presenters navigating global trouble spots, and pledging to return to check whether efforts to offset damage are successful. Steve Backshall is in the Maldives, where the ocean is overheating, destroying swathes of coral reefs; Chris Packham is in Iceland, talking of vanishing glaciers. In Cambodia, Ella Al-Shamahi examines how animal trafficking is driving species to extinction, while Ade Adepitan is in drought-ravaged Kenya with orphaned elephants. For a documentary that hinges on wrong temperatures, there are times when a sense of fire – urgency, passion – seems curiously awol. Only Packham seems galvanised; elsewhere, the dial seems stuck at over-polite/restrained, and the all-important message has all the power of a 20w bulb. Still, how could there not be a humbling magnificence to such a project? Manta rays glide in aquamarine waters like mystical beings; ice caves glisten like hollowed-out ice cubes. You’re left fully aware of the most salient message of the natural world: that we’re damn lucky to live in it. Talking of unnaturally occurring disasters, who has been put in charge of Donald Trump’s fake tan? During the much-trumpeted interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored, the weeknight centrepiece of freshly launched channel TalkTV, Trump’s complexion is a whole new level of cheeseburger. Morgan, meanwhile, maintains a fetching shade of Retired Colonel pink, especially when he blusteringly drags the conversation to himself (so, always). TalkTV, overseen by Rebekah Brooks, appears to be Rupert Murdoch’s answer to GB News, as if he looked at that “populist” gravy boat of lost souls, and mused: “What if someone tried a UK version of plain-speaking/‘anti-woke’ grift, but using actual money?” There are other shows on TalkTV, hosted by the “cancelled” likes of Sharon Osbourne and Jeremy Kyle. However, Morgan is the main draw, as Andrew Neil was for GB News (alas, fleetingly, like a waft of perfume on an enchanted evening, but let’s not dwell). In his launch show, Morgan blasts off with a frenzy of buzz phrases: “snowflake society”; “island of sanity”. Just as predictably, the targets – Harry and Meghan (“Princess Pinocchio”, declares Morgan, almost as though he doesn’t rate her), vegans, liberals and the like – are placed on a loop. As for the “explosive” Trump interview, it is spread out, like the thinnest scrapings of cheap margarine, over the first two nights, because booked guest Caitlyn Jenner – oh, the irony! – cancelled. During the interview, Trump opines in his crumbling-strongman way about Putin (apparently, he wouldn’t have dared invade Ukraine in Trump’s time), hedges about running again for presidency (looks probable), and labels Prince Harry “whipped” (no “pussy”, this time, Mr Ex-President?), to Morgan’s panting delight. The interview is marred by the cult of Piers, Morgan’s egotistical, weirdly needy scrabble to make himself the focus: his cancellation (storming off Good Morning Britain); his friendship and rift with Trump; what Trump really thinks of … (sigh) Piers. Elsewhere, too much airtime is given to whether Trump “stormed out”. In the event, Trump merely shuffles off like an elderly, semi-shaven Chewbacca who needs his afternoon nap. But really, who cares? As demonstrated with his pandemic questioning of politicos, Morgan can be an effective broadcaster, but you wonder if his style best serves as a fiery condiment – the hot pepper sauce to something bland like Good Morning Britain. Along with the new channel as a whole, he needs to beware of delivering yet more Blowhard TV, just with a bigger budget. Over on ITV there’s the return of Grace. Derived from the Roy Grace novels by Peter James and directed by Julia Ford, it’s created and written by Russell Lewis, who also gave us Endeavour (though those who viewed the 2021 pilot episodes will know we’re a long way from a gentle amble through bygone police procedurals here). Set in Brighton, the series stars John Simm as DSI Roy Grace, with Richie Campbell as his sidekick. In the first episode of series two, Grace delivers an intense misanthropist yarn about snuff movies that at times feels akin to Manhunter-on-Sea. Grace is a world-weary detective who isn’t above consulting mediums. At times, things become overwrought, even silly: scarab beetles shoved into the throats of corpses; crucifixions in gimp masks; brooding meditations on everything from the darknet to dismemberments to the darkness of human nature. The saving grace, as it were, is a strong cast, livened up by Line of Duty’s Craig Parkinson on droll form. Moreover, Brighton looks swish. Think: 1990s Los Angeles during a cold spell. Grace’s scheduling (Sunday evening!) could prove to be a problem, but if Lewis wanted to get as far away from Endeavour as possible, he succeeded. I’ve been dreading the remake of Netflix’s Call My Agent! (AKA Dix pour cent), the cult French comedy-drama about celebrity mores. Why bother: how could it be as funny, twisted and delicious? However, Ten Percent (Amazon Prime) is a beautifully crafted hoot. Developed by John Morton, creator of W1A, who also does some of the writing and directing, the eight episodes are set in the fictional Nightingale Hart talent agency, featuring, among others, Jack Davenport, Lydia Leonard, Maggie Steed, Prasanna Puwanarajah and Fola Evans-Akingbola. Hiftu Quasem is a mysterious young stranger, while Tim McInnerny steals scenes as a damp-eyed, vulnerable old duffer who keeps losing his stage mojo. As with the French original, there are myriad celebrity cameos, including Helena Bonham Carter, Olivia Williams, David and Jessica Oyelowo, Dominic West and David Harewood. (Are there any thespians left who could be persuaded not to send themselves up?) There’s a fair degree of overlap with Call My Agent!, but Ten Percent develops its own British flavour, emerging as a dry, witty take on the intersection between actorly ego, human fallibility and air-kissing social whirl. Bravo, darlings, I think we have a hit. OzarkNetflixIt’s the final half-series of the dark, brilliant US white-collar drug-baron drama starring Jason Bateman, Laura Linney and Julia Garner.

5/1/2022,"Two weeks in, we’re weary and bleary, but at least our son is excited to have a little sister. Some of the time. Mostly, he’s about as excited to see a baby as everyone else is, it’s just that he’s more honest about it. Look, babies are lovely, and there is a certain thrill to meeting them for the first time. Even the first few times. After that, the point is made and the fervour subsides a little. Babies are adorable but they don’t have much range. Fifteen minutes into being handed someone else’s, I might as well be holding a warm, purring sandbag. My son is excited when his little sister is awake on her mat, moving her arms and legs about like a stranded turtle. He thinks this is funny because, well, it is. I mean, just get up, you stupid baby! But by the time she’s clasped his finger with her whole hand, released it and turned her face inside out to begin crying again, his arms are resolutely by his sides and he’s off to play with his toys by himself. And that’s just when she’s awake. When she’s asleep, he acts as if we’re trying to excite him with a toy from which the batteries have been callously removed. Babies, he’s discovering, sleep for 18 hours a day and feed or cry during what’s left. The crying might be the biggest shock to his system. He does not care for it and it would be nice if I could ascribe this disdain to concern, but it is definitely contempt. Both for the noise itself – for there are few more penetrating sounds on Earth than a newborn in full fanfare – and towards us for the false advertising he’s beginning to deduce from this whole affair. He was promised a miraculous adventure into brotherhood with a serene and toothsome living doll, brought home just for him. What he got was a smelly little smoke alarm made from bright pink meat, who sleeps all day and he’s not allowed to touch. I’ll admit the cries have stunned us, too. Even second time round, we’re amazed by how rattling they are. Consider that even the smallest whimper of a newborn appears to presage high danger, much like when a character from a period drama coughs once into a hanky and everyone knows they’ll be dead by Michaelmas, Whitsun or Maundy Thursday, basically any of those days the English make up to sound fancy to Americans. As a result, her cries – her actual full-throated, blistering cries – might as well be air raid sirens, so if he’s finding it hard to enjoy that part of newborn adjacency, he’s not alone. Perhaps, then, it was a surprise when he bounded into nursery on his first day back, screaming about his little sister to all his friends. They trundled, quite charmingly, towards him, as if he was an old timey newsboy waving reports from the Russian front in a public square. ‘SHE IS SMALL AND LOUD. I LOVE HER. SHE IS MY LITTLE SISTER,’ he says, repeatedly, as they flock to hear more. All reservations cast aside, he is a newborn evangelist. Maybe talking about babies is more pleasant than looking after them full-time. Not that I’d know anything about that. Did Ye Hear Mammy Died? by Séamas O’Reilly is out now (Little, Brown, £16.99).

5/1/2022,"The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, made a pitch for a “better future” at his official campaign launch in Perth, outlining new policies to try to capture voter attention. The party has veered away from the big-spending and revenue-raising promises of the last election campaign. But Albanese pledged on Sunday that if he wins the 21 May election “the work of building that better future will start the very next day”. Here are the five key policies unveiled by the Labor party on Sunday. Labor promised to cut the price of medicines for general patients under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) by 29%, reducing them by $12.5o to a maximum cost of $30. Labor says its proposal will save a person taking one medication a month $150 a year. The changes to the PBS will take effect from 1 January 2023 and will cost $190m. As part of a pitch to make more things in Australia, Labor vowed to boost onshore manufacturing capability and supply chain resilience with a $1bn “value-adding in resources” fund.The fund will form part of Labor’s $15bn national reconstruction fund and will target the “full value” of the resources sector, particularly rare earths and critical minerals. The scheme would operate through the granting of loans, equity and guarantees for businesses operating in resources value-adding and mining science. Albanese also promised to make gender pay equity an objective in the Fair Work Act and to strengthen the Fair Work Commission’s powers to order pay increases for workers in low-paid, female-dominated industries. The aim is to improve conditions for women in industries such as aged care, early childhood education and care, and disability care. A Labor government would establish a statutory equal remuneration principle, as already exists in Queensland, to guide the FWC and new expert panels to hear equal pay cases. Labor says it will establish a new $500m “driving the nation” fund, which will allow the commonwealth to co-invest in electric vehicle chargers, as well as hydrogen and biofuel refuelling infrastructure. It is pledging to build a national EV charging network with charging stations at an average interval of 150km on major roads and at a cost of $39.3m. The policy, which Labor argues will “fill the gaps” in the country’s charging network and allow long-distance travel across the country, would aim to leverage investment from the NRMA, state governments, industry and car clubs. Labor is also promising to create “hydrogen highways” for a hydrogen refuelling network, and an electric car discount to make EVs cheaper. The centrepiece of Labor’s campaign launch was a policy to address the growing problem of housing affordability, with Albanese declaring Labor will help unlock “the great Australian dream of home ownership”. Labor has promised to establish a $392m housing equity scheme and to establish a national housing supply and affordability council if it wins government. The “help to buy” scheme will provide an equity contribution of up to 40% of the purchase price of a new home, and up to 30% for an existing home, to be made available for 10,000 people. To qualify, eligible homebuyers will have to earn less than $90,000 for an individual or $120,000 for a couple, have a 2% deposit, and be eligible for a standard home loan with a participating lender to finance the remainder of their purchase.",News/Australia news,Labor’s election pitch: five key policies unveiled at party’s campaign launch,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/01/labors-election-pitch-five-key-policies-unveiled-at-partys-campaign-launch
