4/12/2022,"Last weekend, Pakistanis saw something they never expected to see: their prime minister, Imran Khan, in tears. He was addressing the nation on TV after being sent back to the national assembly by the supreme court to face a vote of confidence which he would go on to lose, to be replaced by Shehbaz Sharif. Earlier he had refused to face the vote and had dissolved the assembly but the court declared his actions illegal. Khan refused to accept the rules of the national assembly, tried to evade a ruling by the highest court in the land and only relented a few minutes before the midnight deadline imposed by the court. He turned a banal parliamentary procedure into a nerve-racking edge-of-the-seat thriller. He behaved like a child who realises for the first time that other children have birthdays too. Because he believed that if he wasn’t in charge of the house, he might as well burn it down. In his subsequent 8 April address to the nation, Khan reiterated his claim that it was the US that wanted him out; he asked people if they wanted to be a free nation or American slaves. The US would never do it to India, he said. Here, he welled up, he choked. As a cricketer Khan was always shy of showing his emotion. Even in moments of glory, he offered half-hearted high fives and reluctant, two-tap hugs. But when he became prime minister he learned to emote. And he became very angry. Approaching 70, he transformed into that angry young man who passionately delivers one contradictory sentence after another. For more than two decades, Khan was an outlier in Pakistani politics, more popular with London’s posh set than Pakistani voters; a sports celebrity who wanted to be the saviour king. In order to get his dream job, he got rid of his idealism. Before coming to power he stated that he would rather die than go to the IMF for a loan; a few months after he did, he went begging to the institution. He surrounded himself with the politicians he had claimed were the root cause of Pakistan’s problems. As prime minister, Khan avoided dealing with the country’s structural problems, instead going on a moral crusade because in his youth he had lived a life of sin in the west and now he was not only atoning for it but wanted to be a spiritual father to the nation. In his head he was not only the leader of Pakistan but also the leader of ummah (community of Muslims) who can also do 60 pushups on the go. Last month he lectured foreign ministers of Muslim countries about how porn was responsible for rising divorce rates. He himself is on his third marriage. While in opposition he was focused, hammering away at Pakistan’s rulers on his pet themes of corruption and nepotism. In power he seemed restless and distracted, as if he wanted to be back on the street. He rarely came to parliament, claiming that he could not sit with thieves and looters.Faced with a vote of no confidence, Khan waited for the Pakistan army to come to his rescue. During his rise to power, the army celebrated his ascent and protected him from his political opponents. There was a strong feeling within the armed forces that they had been used, abused and abandoned by the Americans in the latter’s “war on terror”. In Khan they saw a man who was comfortable dealing with the west, and always on his own terms. But this didn’t last. When Khan fell, it wasn’t because he failed to deliver, it was because he fell out with the army. Khan caused huge offence when he wanted his own man to continue as the chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence. Any civilian prime minister interfering with the army or the way it wants to run country’s defence policy is seen as the enemy. As soon as the army withdrew its support, opposition parties moved in for the kill. Why is Khan not blaming the army for his ousting? Behind his petulant facade, there is a pragmatist at work. His party cadres are seething at the army for abandoning them, but Khan himself doesn’t want to burn the bridge that may one day bring him back to office. Khan rose to power by convincing the voters that he was the only clean politician around, that everyone else was corrupt. Now everyone opposing him is not only corrupt but a traitor and an American puppet. Khan never seemed comfortable in office and now he has been sent back to the street where he can start his crusade to save the country all over again.

4/12/2022,"What a strange and intriguing film this is. Knowing nothing about it, for the first 10 minutes or so watching three out-of-work-miners arrive in the Bolivian capital La Paz, I assumed I was watching a documentary. These men, exhausted after walking for seven days, are part of a convoy of hundreds protesting against mine closures and to look for jobs. Director Kiro Russo works with a cast of actual miners – but alongside these verité portraits, he mashes in other film-making styles. In one bonkers scene, traders at a fruit and veg market break into an energetic dance routine, 80s-pop video style. Somehow, Russo pulls it off – mostly. The movie opens with a long sequence as the camera zooms into La Paz, soundtracked by city noises: cars honking, security alarms blaring and the clack-clack of construction work. Russo is interested in the unfathomable scale of the city. His camera pans from window to window of apartment blocks as if astonished that so many lives can squeeze into one place. The film’s three amigos (we don’t learn much about them – they’re all banter, not much reflection) are sleeping rough. They pick up back-breaking casual work as porters, lugging sacks in a market. One of them, Elder (Julio César Ticona), is seriously unwell with a pulmonary illness brought on by breathing in coal dust that gives him a hacking cough. A local woman, Mama Pancha (Francisa Arce de Aro), enlists the help of homeless shaman Max (Max Eduardo Bautista Uchasara) to heal him. (Though I’m not sure blowing fag smoke in Elder’s face is much of a traditional remedy). This is a film of interesting ideas, brilliantly shot with some fascinating scenes. But for me it felt a little too obscure, too impenetrable, with its cast of blank-faced characters and random formal shifts. It’s almost as if it has been created as a test of the audience’s tolerance: are you arthouse enough for this?

4/12/2022,"US poultry companies supplying major grocery stores and fast food chains sold tens of thousands of products contaminated with potentially deadly bacteria between 2015 and 2020, according to government sampling records. The allegations were made in a report published by Vice News. US food safety officials said they were committed to reducing foodborne infections. Meanwhile, an obscure division of the US government had a busy – and ruthless – year in 2021, killing more than 1.75 million animals across the country, at a rate of about 200 creatures every hour. The latest annual toll of Wildlife Services, a department within the US Department of Agriculture, has further stoked the fury of conservation groups that have decried the killings as cruel and pointless. A plea for humanitarian assistance has been issued by the Association of Ukrainian Pig Breeders, with the ongoing war sparking a crisis for the country’s pig industry. “The war, started by Russia, has caused a crisis of enormous scale that threatens the food security, particularly the animal protein supply,” the Ukrainian body said. The escalating bird flu outbreak in the US is causing a surge in egg prices and could even raise prices on other poultry products in the coming months. Avian influenza spreading across the US has led to the deaths of more than 17 million birds, tightening supplies for eggs and poultry, the Wall Street Journal reports. The European Commission has published a summary report of its consultation on animal welfare rules. It concluded that there was a “clear desire to see the end of waterbath stunning, the killing of day-old chicks and for new specific rules for the killing of farmed fish”. It also found support for a ban on live exports to third countries and a ban on the transport of unweaned calves. Software to help farmers monitor pig grunts to help understand when they need help is being developed by animal behaviourist Elodie Briefer of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. It follows a study in which researchers used an artificial intelligence system that determines whether the vocalisations made by pigs are expressions of positive or negative feelings, ABC News reported. Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo and local leaders face renewed pressure to shut down the country’s brutal dog meat trade after footage released by Humane Society International revealed what they allege was horrific animal cruelty and public health risks at livestock markets on the island of Sulawesi. Compassion in World Farming submitted an open letter to the Scottish parliament calling for a moratorium on Scottish salmon farming until a number of animal welfare concerns have been addressed by the industry. Last year, the NGO published photography and video footage which it said showed individual fish in a poor state, with wounds, missing eyes and numbers of sea lice. The salmon industry said the report did not reflect the typical level of fish welfare.British egg farmers are facing unprecedented rises in the cost of producing eggs, leaving many on the brink of bankruptcy. Hendrix Genetics reportedly said that by July 2022, the adult laying hen population will be 3 million (9%) less than the previous two years, with the downward trend set to gather pace. The national flock has declined by about 4 million in the past year. Taxpayers are paying trillions of pounds globally in environmental, human health and economic costs of producing cheap meat, according to World Animal Protection’s report The Hidden Health Impacts of Industrial Livestock Systems. It reveals that 75% of the world’s antibiotics are used on farm animals to prevent them getting sick in poor conditions. There is strong evidence linking the chicken industry to toxic algal blooms on the River Wye, a report has claimed. The Ithon, a tributary of the Wye in mid-Wales, contains levels of phosphate up to ten times higher than in a healthy upland river, according to an analysis of samples by an expert commissioned by Fish Legal, The Times reported. Consumers are no longer be able to buy free-range eggs in the UK, with birds not having been allowed outdoors since November due to fears of avian flu outbreaks. Eggs sold in shops will have to carry a sticker or label saying they are in fact “barn eggs”, the name given to eggs produced by hens permanently housed indoors. Highly virulent variants of avian flu now appear endemic in wild birds, making farms prone to outbreaks all year, experts warned. Bullfighting across Europe is being kept alive by millions of euros paid out by the EU, claim campaigners, despite attempts by MEPs to ban the subsidies. The funding goes to farms that breed bulls for fighting through the EU’s common agricultural policy (CAP), a long-running system of subsidy support to the sector. Two RSPCA animal welfare experts have left the organisation to campaign for a national independent animal welfare commission, saying the current regulatory structure is “broken”. Dr Bidda Jones stepped down as chief scientific officer at RSPCA Australia in late 2021, after 25 years. Dr Jed Goodfellow stepped down as a senior policy officer in October.And finally, meet the US activist who is befriending farmers and rehoming their unwanted male dairy calves, preventing them being killed and discarded on-farm. Many are shot at birth because it is cheaper and easier than waiting for them to gain weight then driving them to market to be sold at auction.

4/12/2022,"In one of the final acts in a 24-year political career, the Republican chief justice of the Ohio supreme court is defying her party and refusing to let them distort electoral districts to their advantage, a move that has some fellow Republicans calling for her impeachment. Since January, Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor has served as the decisive vote on three separate occasions blocking Ohio Republicans from enacting proposed state legislative maps. She also sided with Democrats to block an initial GOP proposal for congressional districts before going into effect in January. Those decisions have prompted chatter among Republicans about impeaching O’Connor, 70, who will leave the court after nearly two decades at the end of this year because she has reached the mandatory retirement age for judges in Ohio. O’Connor has a long independent streak. A decade ago, she joined a dissent when the supreme court upheld the state legislative districts drawn by Republicans. “I broke away from the mould in some people’s minds,” she would later say of that decision. “Party affiliation should not – and people have to understand it should not – have anything to do with how a judge does their job.” In 2018, she joined with the lone Democrat on the court to dissent from a ruling upholding the forced closure of the last abortion clinic in Toledo. She has backed criminal justice and bail reform, as other Ohio Republicans are pushing to make it harder for someone to be released on bond. She has called for less partisan influence in the way judges are elected in the state. In 2020, just before the presidential election, she blasted the state Republican party for accusing a local judge of colluding with Democrats, saying the attack was “disgraceful and deceitful”. “She’s no shrinking violet. She’s got sharp elbows,” said Paul Pfeifer, a Republican who served on the supreme court with O’Connor from when she joined in 2003 until he retired in 2017. “​​No amount of public criticism is going to change her mind if she feels that she’s right in the position she’s taking.” William O’Neill, a Democrat who served with O’Connor on the court from 2013 to 2019, said she was the justice he wound up voting with the most. They were the only two members of the court who dissented in 2018 in the Toledo abortion clinic case. “She can be swayed to reasonable arguments,” he said. “Her legacy is already carved in stone. The stand she is taking is consistent with her entire career.” She’s also one of the most successful politicians in the history of Ohio, said David Pepper, a former chair of the Ohio Democratic party. She’s been elected five times statewide, none of which have been close. The then Ohio governor, Robert Taft, picked the former prosecutor to be his running mate in 1998 to add law enforcement experience to the ticket. Once she was elected lieutenant governor, she oversaw the state’s department of public safety, taking on a leading role after the 9/11 attacks. She would travel overseas with troops being deployed from Ohio, even though that doesn’t typically fall within the responsibilities of her role. “She took the initiative to do that and I would say it was above and beyond what she would have to do in her role,” Taft said in an interview. “She was part of our team but she was also her own person. She was an independent thinker.” She was elected to the court in 2002, and became chief justice in 2010. Now, O’Connor and the court are not backing down in their refusal to let Republicans in the state get away with one of the most brazen efforts to gerrymander electoral districts to their benefit. A new provision in the Ohio constitution requires partisan makeup of the state’s 132 legislative districts roughly reflect the partisan breakdown of statewide elections over the last decade, which is 54% Republican and 46% Democrat. The three plans Republicans have passed so far, and a fourth one currently pending before the court, however, would enable Republicans to win a veto-proof majority in the legislature in a favorable year for the party. “The constitutional violations of the maps that the Ohio redistricting commission continues to pass are obvious,” said Jen Miller, the executive director of the Ohio chapter of the League of Women Voters, which is involved in suits challenging the plans. Republicans have forged a sneaky attempt to enact their maps. The initial plan the court struck down in January would have given them control of 64.4% of districts. They then submitted a new plan to the court that nominally had the required 54-46 split, but several of the districts were barely majority Democratic – essentially toss-ups – meaning Republicans could still win them in a favorable election. After the court rejected that plan, Republicans came back with a third plan that slightly increased the Democratic majority in those districts, which was again rejected by the court. Last month, Republicans submitted a fourth plan that took the same approach. “It’s a pure power play,” said Paul Beck, a retired political science professor at the Ohio State University. “It’s almost like they’re saying we have the power to do this and so we’re gonna do it.” O’Connor has bluntly called out the way Ohio Republicans are abusing the redistricting process. The first time the court struck down the legislative maps, back in January, she went out of her way to write a concurring opinion urging Ohio voters to strip lawmakers of their redistricting power entirely. “Having now seen first-hand that the current Ohio Redistricting Commission– comprised of statewide elected officials and partisan legislators – is seemingly unwilling to put aside partisan concerns as directed by the people’s vote, Ohioans may opt to pursue further constitutional amendment to replace the current commission with a truly independent, nonpartisan commission that more effectively distances the redistricting process from partisan politics,” she wrote. The standoff has left Ohio at a chaotic impasse. Unlike supreme courts in other states, like Virginia that have stepped in to draw maps, the Ohio supreme court is prohibited from making its own plan. Early voting began on 5 April without state legislative districts on the ballot. Last month, a coalition of civic action groups challenged the maps to request that the redistricting commission be held in contempt for failing to comply with the court’s orders. The hard line from O’Connor and three other Democrats on the supreme court, where Republicans have a 4-3 majority, is extremely consequential. This is the first redistricting cycle the partisan fairness requirements are in effect (voters approved them overwhelmingly through a ballot measure in 2015). By refusing to accept the Republican maps, O’Connor and the court are setting a precedent that signals how aggressively the justices are going to police partisan gerrymandering. “The consequence of caving would be a disaster. This has gone from a battle over democracy in Ohio to a battle over democracy and the rule of law in Ohio,” said Pepper, the former Democratic party chair. “No other citizens who violate the law four times get rewarded for it.” After the court blocked Republican maps for the third time, Republicans in the statehouse began openly weighing her impeachment, according to the Columbus Dispatch. “It’s time to impeach Maureen O’Connor now,” Scott Wiggam, a GOP state Representative, tweeted. “I don’t understand what the woman wants,” state representative Sara Carruthers told the Dispatch. Ohio’s secretary of state, Frank LaRose, a Republican who sits on the panel that draws districts, said recently he would not stand in the way of an impeachment effort, saying “she has not upheld her oath of office”. Ohio’s governor, Mike DeWine, a Republican who also sits on the redistricting panel, has been more outspoken against impeachment. “I don’t think we want to go down that pathway because we disagree with a decision by a court, because we disagree with a decision by an individual judge or justice,” he said in March. Though it’s unclear if the impeachment effort will move forward, many doubted it would succeed. Both O’Neill and Pfeifer, the former justices who served with O’Connor said they were confident the impeachment efforts would affect her work. “What in the world is she supposed to have done that violated her oath of office?,” O’Neill said. “It will have the opposite effect of what they’re seeking.”",News/US news,The Republican judge blocking her party from rigging electoral districts,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/12/ohio-republican-judge-blocking-party-from-distorting-electoral-districts
4/12/2022,"Stores across the US have started to ration baby formula while some others are reporting increasing shortages. The nationwide shortage in baby formula comes two months after a huge manufacturer recall which occurred as a result of illnesses and deaths among infants. In March, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a warning to consumers, urging them to be aware of certain products branded Similac, Alimentum and EleCare that have been recalled. The FDA launched an investigation after complaints emerged of bacterial infections in four infants who consumed powdered infant formula produced in Abbott Nutrition’s facility in Michigan. According to the reports, all four infants were hospitalized and the bacterial infection may have contributed to the deaths of two of them. All four cases involved the Cronobacter sakazakii infection, which according to the FDA “can cause severe, life-threatening infections (sepsis) or meningitis (an inflammation of the membranes that protect the brain and spine)”. Cronobacter infections are rare but are especially high-risk for newborns, the agency said. As a result of the recall, approximately 30% of popular baby formula brands may be sold out across the nation, according to an analysis by Datasembly, which assessed supplies in over 11,000 stores. According to Ben Reich, CEO of Datasembly, the baby formula shortage is at a higher level than any other product. “Inflation, supply chain shortages and product recalls have brought an unprecedented amount of volatility to the category, and we expect to continue to see baby formula as one of the most affected categories in the market,” he told USA Today. Last month, the FDA released details of its investigation into Abbott, the baby formula maker, which found that the company did not maintain sanitary conditions at its Michigan plant. According to a USA Today report, Abbott did not maintain clean surfaces that were used in producing and handling the formula. FDA investigators also discovered a history of contamination with Cronobacter, which includes eight instances between fall 2019 and February 2022. In February, Abbott announced a voluntary recall of its powder formulas manufactured in its plant in Sturgis, Michigan. “As part of Abbott’s quality processes, we conduct routine testing for Cronobacter sakazakii and other pathogens in our manufacturing facilities. During testing in our Sturgis, Michigan, facility, we found evidence of Cronobacter sakazakii in the plant in non-product contact areas. We found no evidence of Salmonella Newport,” the company said in a statement. It has since recalled the powder formula manufactured in the facility with an expiration of 1 April 2022 or later. According to Datasembly, the states that have been hardest hit by the shortage are Minnesota, which experienced the highest out-of-stock percentage in the week of 13 March at 54%, Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota and Texas. All these states have a 40 or higher out-of-stock percentage.",News/US news,Baby formula shortages hit stores across US with some rationing supplies,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/12/baby-formula-shortages-us-stores-rationing
4/12/2022,"Good morning. Russia is receiving munitions and military hardware sourced from Iraq for its war effort in Ukraine with the help of Iranian weapons-smuggling networks, according to members of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias and regional intelligence services with knowledge of the process. RPGs and anti-tank missiles, as well as Brazilian-designed rocket launcher systems, have been dispatched to Russia from Iraq as Moscow’s campaign has faltered in the last month, the Guardian has learned. And an Iranian-made Bavar 373 missile system, similar to the Russian S-300, has been donated to Moscow by the authorities in Tehran. Using the weapons-trafficking underworld would signal a dramatic shift in Russian strategy as Moscow is forced to lean on Iran, its military ally in Syria, after new sanctions triggered by the invasion of Ukraine. Has phosphorus been used in Mariupol? Ukraine is checking unverified information that Russia may have used chemical weapons in Mariupol, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, has said. “There is a theory that these could be phosphorus munitions,” she said. What has the US said about this? The Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said he was aware of the reports but could not confirm them. “These reports, if true, are deeply concerning and reflective of concerns that we have had about Russia’s potential to use a variety of riot control agents, including teargas mixed with chemical agents, in Ukraine,” he said. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 48 of the invasion. Joe Biden has announced a crackdown on “ghost guns”, untraceable firearms assembled from kits, which have been used in a rising number of shooting crimes. The president, who has promised to tackle gun violence across America, said the new rule would make it easier for law enforcement officials to track and catch those who use illegal firearms. “These guns are weapons of choice for many criminals,” Biden said during an event in the White House Rose Garden. “We’re going to do everything we can to deprive them of that choice and when we find them, put them in jail for a long, long time … If you commit a crime with a ghost gun, expect federal prosecution.” He also announced the nomination of Steve Dettelbach, the US attorney in Ohio from 2009 to 2016, to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). What are ghost guns? They are often assembled from kits, do not have serial numbers and are sold without background checks, making them easy to acquire and difficult to trace. How many of them are there? It’s hard to know but in 2021 there were about 20,000 suspected ghost guns reported to the ATF as having been recovered by law enforcement in criminal investigations – a tenfold increase from 2016, according to statistics shared by the White House. The US state department yesterday ordered non-emergency US government workers to leave the consulate in Shanghai owing to a surge in Covid cases and China’s strict measures to control the virus. On Friday the state department announced that non-emergency personnel could voluntarily leave the consulate. It is not clear why the departure of those workers has become mandatory. “Our change in posture reflects our assessment that it is best for our employees and their families to be reduced in number and our operations to be scaled down as we deal with the changing circumstances on the ground,” the department said yesterday. China responded angrily to the earlier voluntary departure order. What measures is China taking to control coronavirus? The most controversial of Shanghai’s practices had been separating Covid-positive children from their parents. The state department cited the risk of parents and children being separated in yesterday’s announcement. Philadelphia became the first major US city to reinstate its indoor mask mandate yesterday after reporting a sharp increase in coronavirus infections, with the city’s top health official saying she wanted to forestall a potential new wave driven by an Omicron sub-variant. At least 24 people have been killed in landslides and flooding across central and southern Philippines, authorities said yesterday, after tropical storm Megi dumped heavy rain on the region and disrupted travel before the Easter holidays. More than 13,000 people fled to emergency shelters as the storm raged. Stores across the US have started to ration baby formula while some others are reporting increasing shortages. The problems come two months after a huge manufacturer recall that occurred as a result of illnesses and deaths among infants. Britney Spears has apparently revealed she is pregnant with her third child, months after she was released from a conservatorship that she said prevented her from marrying and having additional children. The Toxic singer shared the news in a post on Instagram yesterday. The rising price of food caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and increased energy costs could push a quarter of a billion more people into extreme poverty, Oxfam has said. It said these new challenges had piled on to the economic crises created by Covid, and the charity called for urgent international action including cancelling debt repayments for this year and next, which could free up $30bn (£23bn) for dozens of the countries facing the biggest debts. The world of work was already quite sick before the coronavirus took hold, but the pandemic put rocket boosters on cultural change. We can see the impact of this in every metric around work: during the Great Resignation of 2021, millions of American workers resigned en masse. Workers worldwide have declared they would quit their jobs if not provided with flexibility. Mobility and freedom are the new prizes for the professional working class. But some companies fail to grasp the scale and sweep of change. Today, ocean waters are a tumult of engine noise, sonar and seismic blasts, writes David George Haskell. We are severing the sensory links that gave the world its animal diversity. Whales cannot hear the echolocating pulses that locate their prey, breeding fish cannot find one another amid the noise and turbidity, and the social connections among crustaceans are weakened as their chemical messages and sonic thrums are lost in a haze of human pollution. We could make it stop, so why don’t we? A video recently posted online shows what happens when police try to apprehend an autonomous vehicle. Police in San Francisco stopped a vehicle that had been driving without headlights, only to find it was empty. “Ain’t nobody in it – this is crazy,” a bystander can be heard saying in the video, posted on 1 April. The car then speeds away to the other side of the intersection, leaving the police behind. “Welcome to the future,” quipped one Twitter user.

4/12/2022,"Back when the console industry was still young, and the PC was an expensive business machine for grownups, the Commodore Amiga was one of the most vibrant and diverse gaming platforms available. Originally launched as the Amiga 1000 in 1985, its 16-bit 68000 CPU and array of graphics acceleration coprocessors promised a new era of visually and sonically advanced gaming – a prospect realised by the 1987 launch of the more affordable Amiga 500. Supported by an array of small, talented studios, and inspiring a vast community of demo coders, it was the home computer for a generation of players and creators. Now, following the success of retro consoles such as the SNES Mini and Mega Drive Mini the Amiga is back in the form of the A500 Mini, a teeny replica of the original Amiga 500 with 25 built-in games. As with other machines in this growing category, the A500 is designed to be plugged into a modern LCD TV via an HDMI cable. Users can opt to run games in 50hz or 60hz depending on their display; they can also scale the image to fit, and there’s a decent CRT mode, which simulates the scan lines you’d see on an old cathode ray TV or monitor. However you set things up, what you’re getting is Amiga code running via an emulator rather than on the original hardware or an FPGA like the Analogue Mega Sg. However, the emulation is excellent and every one of the built-in games plays perfectly well, with no weird glitches or controller issues. The system also supports later iterations of the Amiga system, namely the Enhanced Chip Set and the Advanced Graphics Architecture of the Amiga 1200. Control is via a USB joypad, which resembles the model that came with the Amiga CD32 console, and a pleasingly authentic (and chunky) two-button USB mouse. The latter is fine, but the joypad feels very plasticky and is not hugely responsive, which can make instinctive shooters such as Project-X and The Chaos Engine very frustrating. Nevertheless, playing these classic games on your TV is a joyful nostalgic experience. The 25 titles include stone cold legends such as the aforementioned The Chaos Engine, the futuristic sports sim Speedball 2, the innovative driving game Stunt Car Racer and the definitive multi-platform superstar, Worms: The Director’s Cut. The collection also shows the range of the machine – and of that fecund era of gaming – where you could get formative first-person shooters such as Alien Breed 3D sitting in the charts beside chess games and pinball sims. The Amiga was very much a platform of genre experimentation, an incubator for ideas that would shape modern game design. Hence, we find prototype strategy action titles such as Lost Patrol and Dragons Breath, and we get the cinematic adventure Another World, which holds up incredibly well. Importantly, you are not restricted to these titles alone. Players will also be able to download games from the internet and load them on to the machine via a USB stick, giving you access to a vast library. Given all the Amiga greats that aren’t on there – Lemmings, Cannon Fodder, The Secret of Monkey Island, Syndicate et al – this feels like an essential addition. As ever, there are familiar counter-arguments to investing in a mini console. Instead of paying £120 for one of these, you could download an emulator for your PC or build your own Amiga clone using a cheap Raspberry Pi. But these solutions require a reasonable amount of technical knowhow – certainly more than simply buying a convenient readymade unit that comes with 25 tested, working games and all the hardware you need to run them on a TV. And besides, the form factor of the A500 is so cute, it’s a nice little thing to store beside your other mini machines. The A500 is a robust piece of tech nostalgia that will give veteran fans many hours of nostalgic pleasure while also providing an accessible means of introducing younger family members to the Amiga scene. The colourful sprites, pounding techno soundtracks and sardonic wit of the beloved Sensible Software, Team 17 and Bitmap Brothers games retain their appeal and it has been fascinating to rediscover how much the modern independent gaming scene owes to this 35-year-old home computer.",Arts/Games,A500 Mini review – tiny Commodore Amiga is a robust piece of tech nostalgia,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/apr/12/a500-mini-commodore-amiga-review
4/12/2022,"When Hazel McCallion retired in 2014 as the mayor of the Canadian city of Mississauga, she was 93. But while most people her age typically retreat from the spotlight of public life, “Hurricane Hazel” has shown little interest in slowing down. At 101, she recently accepted an offer to extend her role as a director for the greater Toronto airport authority, a contract that will last three years. Omar Alghabra, Canada’s transport minister, congratulated the centenarian, commending her four decades of community service and her future “overseeing and guiding Canada’s largest airport”. The job extension was announced last week, less than a month after she renewed her role as special adviser to the University of Toronto Mississauga, with the school praising her “encyclopaedic knowledge of politics”. Known for her blunt demeanour and pugilistic style of governing, McCallion has loomed large over Ontario civics for decades, despite her diminutive height. A school, library, parade and baseball team all bear her name. A light rail project dubbed the Hazel McCallion Line was announced in February. “She looms very large in Ontario politics, far beyond what one would expect simply by reading the statutes about the powers of a mayor,” said Tom Urbaniak, a professor of political science at Cape Breton university and author of a book about McCallion. “One former premier remarked, ‘She’s the one politician in Ontario who scares the bejesus out of me.’ So whenever she wants to pronounce on an issue to this day – whenever she wants to wade into something – it gets noticed.” Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, described McCallion as the “icon of Canada” at a celebration of her 100th birthday last year. “I love her, she’s a mentor and she’s taught me so much and she’s always there for everyone,” he said. Ford arrived at the event wearing an Ontario Women’s Hockey Association jersey with the name “Hazel” on the back and the number 100 – a nod to her stint as a professional hockey player earlier in her life. Born in Port Daniel, Quebec, in 1921, McCallion was the youngest of five children during the Depression. She later found work at an engineering firm in Montreal and played professional hockey, making C$5 per game – a figure worth nearly C$100 today. The engineering firm relocated her to Toronto, where in middle age she developed a keen interest in local politics. McCallion held various municipal roles before running for mayor of Mississauga in 1978 – defeating an incumbent who suggested during his campaign that her gender was a political weakness. “She was a pragmatic populist and she has an incredible ability to feel the public pulse, even before the public feels it,” Urbaniak said. McCallion shopped at different grocery stores each week to better understand the frustrations of constituents. She would then carefully place those grievances into stump speeches. “That’s a knack that she never lost.” McCallion stayed on as mayor for the next 36 years as the city grew from a patchwork of farmland west of Toronto into Canada’s seventh-largest city. She finally stepped down in 2014 with her political instincts intact: she endorsed the eventual winners of Ontario’s two most recent provincial elections, as well as Justin Trudeau before his successful bid for prime minister in 2015. Despite her influence, or because of it, McCallion has brushed up against allegations that she breached conflict of interest rules. In 1982, a court determined she had failed to abstain from council discussions over a planning decision in which she had an interest. In 2009, she faced accusations that a proposed convention centre and luxury hotel would have benefited her son, whose company had a financial stake in the project worth millions. A judge involved in the inquiry concluded her actions amounted to “real and apparent conflict of interest”. McCallion insisted she had done nothing wrong and the case was thrown out in 2013. Urbaniak says he laughed when he heard that McCallion had renewed her contract with the region’s airport authority. “She will stay active as long as she can,” he said. “But she was famously in a years-long running battle with the former head of the airport authority. He thought he would get the better of Hazel McCallion. And he didn’t.”",News/World news,"‘Hurricane Hazel’: political icon, 101, hired to run Canada’s largest airport",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/hazel-mccallion-101-canada-mississauga-airport
