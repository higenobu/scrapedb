12/30/2021,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The United States is at risk of paying an ""unbearable price"" due to its actions over Taiwan, Wang Yi, state councillor and foreign minister, said in an interview with state media on Thursday. China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and in the past two years has stepped up military and diplomatic pressure to assert its sovereignty claim, fuelling anger in Taipei and concern in Washington. By ""encouraging 'Taiwan independence' forces"" the United States ""not only puts Taiwan into an extremely dangerous situation but also exposes the United States to an unbearable price"", Wang said. Taiwan has emerged as a key factor in strained relations between China and the United States, the island's most important international backer and arms supplier despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties. Taiwan says it is an independent country and vows to defend its freedom and democracy. China regularly describes the island as the most sensitive issue in its ties with the United States. ""Taiwan has no other way forward other than reunification with the mainland,"" said Wang. While the United States recognises only one China, it is required by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself and has long followed a policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" on whether it would intervene militarily to protect Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack.

12/30/2021,"Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted on sex-trafficking charges and faces up to 65 years in prison. She can appeal and fight the decision, or start cooperating with investigators. Either way, it's unlikely Maxwell avoids substantial jail time, experts told Insider. Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite and longtime associate of convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, was found guilty Wednesday of five charges in her high-profile sex-trafficking trial. Maxwell was convicted on three conspiracy charges, a separate sex-trafficking count, and of transporting a minor to engage in illegal sexual activity. The charges face a potential sentence of 65 years. The verdict came nearly a year and a half after Maxwell, 60, was arrested and accused of arranging and participating in the sexual abuse of underage girls. In light of the conviction, she has two paths forward, and neither one will necessarily keep her from spending significant time behind bars. ""Maxwell truly has two options — she can fight this case and take it up on appeal, where she will likely face a 65-year sentence, or she can start issuing some names of who else was involved for a substantially lighter sentence,"" Matthew Barhoma, a criminal appeals attorney in Los Angeles, told Insider. In a statement Wednesday night, Maxwell's family said they plan to appeal the decision. ""We firmly believe in Ghislaine's innocence. Obviously, we are very disappointed with the verdict. We have already started working on the appeal and we are confident that she will be vindicated,"" Bobbi C. Sternheim, one of Maxwell's lawyers, told reporters outside the courthouse in Manhattan. Neama Rahmani, president of West Coast Trial Lawyers and a former federal prosecutor, told Insider he does not believe Maxwell has a legal basis to appeal, but that he expects she will anyways. ""She's going to appeal because otherwise, she's going to die in federal prison,"" Rahmani said, adding that he believed the prosecution's case against Maxwell was strong. Barhoma agreed, but said he thought Maxwell could have some strong claims in an appeals process. For example, one of the four women who testified they were sexually abused was over the legal age of consent at the time of the incident, prompting the judge to instruct jurors not to convict based on her testimony. However, she was still allowed to testify as a witness, and Barhoma said it could be argued in appeals that she improperly influenced the jury. He also noted it could be argued some of the evidence was ""dated or stale"" since some of the accusations concern incidents from decades ago. Even if Maxwell has some success in the appeals process and the case was retried, prosecutors would still likely get a conviction, based on the strength of their case and the other accusers' testimonies, Barhoma said. It is extremely unlikely, he said, that the conviction gets thrown out entirely. Many famous and powerful people have been linked to Epstein in one way or another, including former presidents, princes, and wealthy businessmen. ""The most interesting part is what everyone wants to know: is she going to cooperate?"" Rahmani said. ""Is she going to name names, or does she just appeal and remain silent?"" Maxwell thus far has given the impression that she's not interested in cooperating in the investigation surrounding Epstein, but that could change in light of her conviction. ""You don't want to be a snitch, you don't want to start pointing the finger, but now you're a convicted felon and you're looking at decades in federal prison,"" Rahmani said. ""Do you try to save yourself?"" If Maxwell cooperates, her deal with prosecutors could ultimately depend on the extent of her help, including whether she is willing to testify against others or whether her cooperation results on others being convicted. Regardless, there are likely minimum sentences that would have to be met. Also working against Maxwell is the fact that Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting sex-trafficking charges, making her the central figure in the investigation. Rahmani said given that Epstein was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges when he died (though he pleaded guilty in 2007 to solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors for prostitution), prosecutors will have to be ""really sensitive"" about giving Maxwell a break in exchange for her cooperation — even if it proves highly valuable. ""It's really a fine line you gotta walk. You obviously want the information. You want to encourage her to testify. You want to prosecute other people that were actually involved in the sex abuse,"" he said. ""But you don't want to give Maxwell a free pass, because she was instrumental to the abuse.""

12/30/2021,"By Luc Cohen NEW YORK (Reuters) -British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell on Wednesday was convicted of recruiting and grooming teenage girls for sexual encounters with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein between 1994 and 2004. Below is an explanation of what comes next for Maxwell, the 60-year-old daughter of late British media baron Robert Maxwell: WHEN WILL MAXWELL BE SENTENCED? Maxwell faces up to 65 years in prison for the five charges she was convicted of. She was found guilty https://www.reuters.com/world/us/maxwell-jury-resume-deliberations-after-judge-warns-omicron-risk-2021-12-29 of sex trafficking, the most serious charge she faced with a maximum prison term of 40 years. U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan did not say when Maxwell would be sentenced. Maxwell separately faces two perjury counts that will be tried at a later date. WILL MAXWELL APPEAL? Maxwell's lawyer Bobbi Sternheim told reporters the defense was disappointed with the verdict and will appeal. ""We have already started working on the appeal, and we are confident that she will be vindicated,"" Sternheim said outside of the courthouse. While the judge dealt several blows to the defense - ruling, for example, that their witnesses could not testify anonymously as some of Maxwell's accusers did - legal experts said Maxwell would struggle to clear the high legal bar needed to overturn a guilty verdict. To succeed, her lawyers would have to show that the judge violated federal rules of evidence or abused her discretion, and that the error impacted the verdict. WHAT CHARGES DOES SHE STILL FACE? The two perjury counts relate to allegations that Maxwell lied under oath about her role in Epstein's abuse during a deposition for a separate civil suit in 2016. Nathan in April granted Maxwell's request to sever the two charges from the rest of the counts. The two perjury counts each carry a maximum prison sentence of five years. WHERE WILL MAXWELL GO NOW? Maxwell will return to Brooklyn's notorious Metropolitan Detention Center, where she has been held in isolation since July 2020. Maxwell has said she has been served moldy food at the jail and that the smell of raw sewage has permeated her cell.

Florida and Texas have received by far the largest influx of new residents relocating from other states. Greene also once again discussed a ""national divorce,"" where blue and red states split.

The user suggested ""actively discriminating against transplants like this through legislation"" and should ""pay a tax for their sins."" —Pedro L. Gonzalez (@emeriticus) December 29, 2021 Florida and Texas received the highest number of new residents relocating from inside the US between July 2020 and July 2021, according to the latest Census data. Florida's population rose by 220,890 people due to domestic migration, while Texas's population jumped by 170,307 people during the 12-month period. In the same time frame, 367,299 people moved away from California, and 352,185 migrated from New York, the highest out of any state in the US. Illinois came in at a distant third place, with 122,460 people moving away. In her tweet, Greene said the Twitter user's suggestions would all be ""possible"" in the event of a ""national divorce"" between Democratic and Republican states. In October, Green conducted a controversial Twitter poll asking her followers if they wanted to split red and blue states. A close majority — 47.7% — of 84,487 responses on social media supported staying together. Another 9% said they were undecided. But Greene later said on a podcast with Steve Bannon that the 43% who voted to split the US served as a ""wake-up call"" to Democrats and showed how ""irreconcilable"" the nation's divisions have become.
