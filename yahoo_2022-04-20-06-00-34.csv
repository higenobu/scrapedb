4/20/2022,"Netflix (NFLX) reported an unexpected decline in first-quarter net subscribers as the company navigated an exit from Russia and an increasingly saturated North American market. Shares slumped by more than 20% in after-hours trading following the report. Here were the key metrics from Netflix's quarterly report, compared to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg: Revenue: $7.87 billion vs. $7.95 billion expected, $7.16 billion Y/Y Earnings per share: $3.53 vs. $2.91 expected, $3.75 Y/Y Net subscribers: -200,000 vs. +2.51 million expected, +3.98 million million Y/Y Netflix's drop in new users came as a surprise to Wall Street, with analysts looking for a slowdown but still positive growth in subscriptions in the first three months of 2022. Subscribers grew by nearly 4 million in the same quarter last year. In total, Netflix exited the first quarter with 221.64 million global subscribers. ""Netflix was all about subscribers for so long,"" Santosh Rao, Manhattan Venture Partners head of research, told Yahoo Finance Live Tuesday afternoon following Netflix's results. “The whole story has to be evaluated from a lower base now. And the multiples are getting compelling at this point, but we need to see that the growth story is still intact and they have a strategy to tackle the challenges ahead.” For the current quarter, Netflix said it expected an even steeper decline in new users. The streamer said it sees subscribers declining by 2 million in the fiscal second quarter, whereas consensus analysts were looking for a gain of 2.4 million. ""Our relatively high household penetration — when including the large number of households sharing accounts — combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds,"" Netflix said in its letter to shareholders Tuesday afternoon. ""The big COVID boost to streaming obscured the picture until recently."" ""While we work to reaccelerate our revenue growth — through improvements to our service and more effective monetization of multi-household sharing — we’ll be holding our operating margin at around 20%,"" Netflix added. ""Key to our success has been our ability to create amazing entertainment from all around the world, present it in highly personalized ways, and win more viewing than our competitors."" Netflix has been grappling with slowing user growth for much of the past year, with new users slowing to a trickle after a pandemic-fueled surge in sign-ups. But further exacerbating this slowdown was Netflix's exit from Russia in early March, which came following the country's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. Netflix said in its investor letter that suspending service in Russia removed 700,000 net paid subscribers during the quarter. The company also said it saw a contraction in subscribers in the U.S. and Canada, which combined lost a net 600,000 paying users. Earlier this year, Netflix had announced another price hike for North American viewers, which the company cited as cause for the attrition during the quarter, though it added the overall effect of the price hike was ""significantly revenue positive."" Heading into these results, some analysts also suggested Netflix might continue to see elevated levels of churn especially in the U.S. and Canada following these price increases. With competition mounting from the likes of Disney+, HBO Max and others newcomers, users now have more options than ever to turn to in lieu of Netflix, should they choose to end one subscription in favor of another, some said. ""Content dumps, where all episodes of a new season are delivered at the same instant, will likely keep churn high, as price conscious consumers can swap out of Netflix and shift to a competitor service after viewing the content they desire,"" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said in a note head of Netflix's report. ""Sustainable profit growth should continue so long as Netflix is able to continue raising subscription prices, but competition may limit future price increases."" But while a saturated North American market has left Netflix with relatively less runway to continue adding users, the company’s international growth prospects have recently been riper by comparison. For the first quarter, Netflix added nearly 1.1 million users in its Asia Pacific geographic segment. Still, however, it also shed subscribers on net across both its Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Latin America (LATAM) segments. Amid concerns over subscriber growth, Netflix’s shares have fallen to underperform the broader market so far this year. Shares have declined by 42% for 2022-to-date through Tuesday’s close, compared to an about 6% drop in the S&P 500 over that period. — Emily McCormick is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

4/20/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- A day after Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina touted the country’s alternative to the SWIFT financial-messaging service, the regulator said it will no longer publicly disclose who participates.

But Nabiullina told parliament Monday that 52 institutions from 12 countries are participating. Until recently, the list was posted on the central bank’s website. “Under the current circumstances we decided not to disclose on the website the list of companies connected to the system,” the press service said. “The users of the system can still see the list.” Russia set up the system in 2014 after the first waves of sanctions over Ukraine. Nabiullina told legislators Tuesday that the central bank will continue its push to add new members, according to Interfax. “Until there was such a threat of being cut off from SWIFT, foreign partners weren’t in much of a rush to join, but now we expect their readiness to be greater,” she said. The list of participants is only one of several items that have disappeared from the central bank’s website in the weeks since the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, which triggered sanctions on the Bank of Russia itself. On Tuesday, the central bank said that it will no longer publish quarterly data on the schedule for repayments of foreign debt. Previously, it suspended release of some detailed information on its reserves.

4/20/2022,"The Biden administration continued its student loan cancellation effort on Tuesday by announcing that 40,000 borrowers would see their student loans become eligible for discharge under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and 3.6 million more will move closer towards forgiveness. The Education Department will give borrowers retroactive credit for ""forbearance steering,"" where student loan servicers have pushed borrowers into unnecessary interest-accruing forbearance. In another move that could help many other borrowers, the department will also take greater care to accurately track monthly payments for borrowers on income-driven repayment — which allows people who make less money to make smaller payments. The two moves bring millions of borrowers closer to forgiveness on government repayment programs. “Student loans were never meant to be a life sentence, but it’s certainly felt that way for borrowers locked out of debt relief they’re eligible for,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a press release. ""We wanted to act as quickly as possible to address these problems, but we expect these figures to only grow as we continue to analyze and implement these solutions,"" Education Undersecretary James Kvaal said on a call with reporters. A former Obama-era Education Department official last week highlighted the problematic income-driven repayment program as one reason for broad-based student debt forgiveness. ""We ... were very focused on trying to improve income-driven repayment plans and our hope was in the Obama administration that income-driven repayment would help address the student debt crisis,"" former Education Secretary John King, who is running for governor in Maryland, said. ""But the reality is, it hasn't."" A recent investigation by NPR revealed how over the years, loan servicers struggled to implement income-driven repayment, and ended up systematically mismanaging the portfolio. Some providers were not clearly tracking payments and did not know when borrowers qualified for forgiveness. The mismanagement caused many to miss out on debt relief. According to past research from the National Consumer Law Center, despite millions of student debtors qualifying for forgiveness under income-driven repayment terms stipulating that borrowers who pay for 20-25 years can their debt forgiven, only 32 borrowers have actually had their debt cancelled. The government's efforts to reform the system piece by piece instead of broad-based forgiveness has chipped away at the $1.7 trillion in outstanding student loan debt held by 41 million Americans. Overall, the Biden administration has cancelled more than $17 billion in debt for 725,000 borrowers, from fixing Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program to addressing the borrower defense backlog. According to the announcement on Tuesday, the Education Department is addressing two major problems. It's acknowledging people who have loans in forbearance and accrued huge levels of interest payments, and it's also helping borrowers who have had their income-driven payments miscounted. On forbearance, the department noted that loan servicers have in the past placed borrowers into forbearance even when debtors could have qualified for an income-driven repayment plan that would have allowed them to make $0 payments. Forbearance causes borrowers' interest to capitalize and their debt to grow substantially. The department will address this by conducting a one-time adjustment where it will count forbearance of more than 12 consecutive months and more than 36 months cumulative towards forgiveness under income-driven repayment or Public Student Loan Forgiveness. It will also increase oversight of servicers' usage of forbearance. The Education Department will also conduct a one-time revision of income-riven payment counts for all Direct Loans and federally managed Federal Family Education Loan Program loans. Any months where debtors have made payments will count towards income-driven repayment, regardless of payment plan, and consolidation status. And importantly, any borrower who hits the 20- or 25-year mark for monthly payments after this revision will have their loans canceled automatically, the department stated. — Aarthi is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
