12/29/2021,"My husband, Chris Honer, who has died aged 73 of cancer, was artistic director of the Library Theatre Company (LTC) in Manchester for 27 years, from 1987 to 2014. While at LTC his many acclaimed productions included The Merchant of Venice, The Life of Galileo, Someone Who’ll Watch Over Me and Waiting for Godot, all of which won Best Production in the Manchester Theatre Awards. He was also noted for his memorable Brecht productions. Under Chris’s leadership LTC produced 14 shows a year, including, in his early years, some at the Forum theatre in Wythenshawe. Right from the start he placed an emphasis on reaching out to communities with limited access to the arts and on fostering new talent.  Chris was an only child, born in Chingford, Essex, and brought up in Croydon, south London, where his parents, Douglas and Margaret (nee Keslake), were school teachers. He attended the local Whitgift school, where he discovered not only a love of the theatre and literature, but a passion for birdwatching. He went on to study English language and literature at Lincoln College, Oxford, and the two of us met at an Oxford University Dramatic Society production of Hamlet, on which he was student director. We married in 1972, divorced in the mid-1990s, and remarried in 2012. Chris started his directing career under the repertory theatre trainee director scheme at the Belgrade theatre in Coventry, going on to be the first director of the Studio theatre at Birmingham Rep before becoming artistic director at the Gateway theatre in Chester and then at the Derby Playhouse. His productions in those earlier years included the premieres of Anthony Minghella’s Love Bites, Stephen Bill’s Over the Bar, and David Edgar’s O Fair Jerusalem and Death Story. In 2012 the refurbishment by Manchester city council of the Central Library led to the closure of the theatre space. After that, Chris oversaw the merging of the theatre company with the Cornerhouse cinema and arts centre, to form the multicultural venue HOME. During the transition he continued to direct shows for the company, including an outstanding production of Tom Stoppard’s Arcadia at the Lowry and an extraordinary site-specific production of Hard Times at Murray’s Mill. Chris stepped down from his role as artistic director of LTC just before HOME opened in 2015, but continued to work as a freelance, directing productions at Oldham Coliseum, Manchester School of Theatre and Theatre by the Lake. He also served as accreditation panel chair for the National Council for Drama Training, chaired the Drama Centre Advisory Council and was an examiner for the Trinity College London examination board. Chris was given a special achievement award at the Theatre Awards in 2014 for his contribution to theatre in Manchester. He is survived by me, our sons, Tom and Nick, and our grandson, Robin.",Arts/Stage,Chris Honer obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/dec/28/chris-honer-obituary
12/29/2021,"Thousands of New Year’s Eve revellers are expected to escape strict Covid-19 restrictions in Wales by hopping across the border to visit nightspots in English towns and cities. Leaders of the nightlife industry in Wales are angry that they will lose trade to their counterparts in England because Welsh nightclubs have been ordered to shut and pubs told to put in social distancing measures.  But the Welsh government insisted on Tuesday that its restrictions were proportionate, with the latest seven-day coronavirus rate per 100,000 people rising to 1,004 – the highest since the pandemic began. About 6,000 new infections are being confirmed daily, the majority caused by the Omicron variant. Nick Newman, the chair of the Cardiff Licensees Forum, said he expected many people to leave Wales for England. “It’s 40 minutes from Newport to Bristol and it’s easy to get from north Wales into Manchester or Liverpool. English businesses are going to benefit. “We’re hugely disappointed with the stance the Welsh government is taking, especially not presenting the evidence that links the virus to the hospitality industry.” Mark Finlay, the operations manager for a number of pubs and bars in Wrexham, which is close to the border, said people were bound to pop over to places like Chester for a night out with few restrictions. “It’s frustrating that a few minutes down the road you can celebrate a normal New Year’s Eve but we’re not allowed that opportunity here. For us it will be an average night serving people at tables. There won’t be the normal party atmosphere. I’m fully expecting everyone to go to Chester.” Debbie Evans, who runs the Kerry Lamb pub in Kerry, mid Wales, said in 2019 it had 70 people dining at New Year’s Eve and up to 100 in the bar. This year staff are gearing up to serve only about 50 in total. “But to be honest we’re not getting the bookings,” she said. “People are either worried about coming out or if not they will be taking the short hop over the border for a restriction-free evening in England. It feels to me it would be safer for them to stay in their own community rather than mixing with strangers.” Edmund Inkin, a founding member of the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective, said: “The feeling that economic value is being taken away and going across the border at a very difficult time is not good for morale.” The Welsh government is making £120m of emergency support available but Inkin said the few thousand pounds most would get was a “drop in the ocean”. He said owners and workers were demoralised because there was no end in sight for the restrictions – while hospitality in England has been told it can carry on over new year largely as normal. Michael Kill, CEO of the Night Time Industries Association, said he was concerned that some Welsh partygoers would be tempted to attend packed house parties or illegal raves in Wales. “People will push the boundaries and would be safer in regulated settings with safeguards in place.” The leader of the Tories in the Welsh parliament, Andrew RT Davies, said it was unacceptable that the Welsh government had not published the scientific advice and evidence behind the restrictions. He said: “Many Welsh businesses will be severely hit this Christmas and new year, and I can understand their anger and frustration given they’re not being afforded the advice that’s provided to ministers.” A Welsh government spokesperson said: “The Omicron variant is causing a rapid rise in coronavirus cases across Wales. Already, people are off work sick, putting essential services under strain and we expect this situation to get worse. “New protections have been put into place to help businesses continue to trade, and updated and strengthened guidance has been issued to help people stay safe in their homes. We all need to do everything we can to protect ourselves and keep Wales safe.”",News/UK news,England braces for Welsh revellers escaping Covid restrictions,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/28/england-braces-for-welsh-revellers-escaping-covid-restrictions
12/29/2021,"My father, Alan Ward, who has died aged 96, was a physicist who profoundly influenced science education in Africa. Born in Woodford, Essex, to Ursula (nee Vale) and Edward Ward, who worked in a bank, Alan went to Chichester high school for boys in West Sussex. Following a wartime degree in physics at the University of Birmingham, he completed a PhD in 1949, after which he was sent by the Atomic Energy Research Establishment to study Thorotrast poisoning in Denmark for two years. He married Honor Shedden, also a physicist, in 1950.  The following year he took up a lectureship at the University College of the Gold Coast (now the University of Ghana), becoming associate professor in 1963. There he set up a radioactivity laboratory, supported by the Radiochemical Centre in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, and conducted experiments that established the toxicity of Strontium-90, an isotope of concern in fallout from nuclear weapons. Alan built an international network of scientists involved in peaceful uses of radioactivity, and was part of the Atoms for Peace Geneva conference in 1958. His work expanded into using nuclear markers for agriculture and health. When France set off a nuclear device in Algeria in 1960, he proved the extent of radioactive fallout in Ghana, and provided insights into the impacts on the local population. This resulted in an irate French government sending in an army officer to verify the findings. Ward presented his findings to President Nkrumah, contributing to Ghana breaking off diplomatic relations with France. In the early 1960s Alan used information from contacts at Cern and the International Atomic Energy Agency to suggest that a proposed Soviet nuclear research project at Kwabenya in Ghana was deeply unwise. His warning upset Nkrumah, and as a result he was asked to leave the country in 1965. For the next 10 years he worked at the University of Zambia in Lusaka, founding a physics department there. He then moved to the Kwaluseni campus of the University of Botswana and Swaziland, lecturing there until 1986. Throughout their careers, both Alan and Honor played an active role in developing science education, teaching physics at all levels, and supporting the development of applied physics infrastructure in Africa. Their Christian faith was always at the centre of their lives. Both were quiet but vociferous opponents of racist and colonial attitudes and expressed their aspiration to “make themselves redundant”. In 1976, Alan was made OBE. He retired to the village of Hermitage, in Dorset, in 1986, where he worked for the Open University and the University of the Third Age, became chair of the Battery Vehicle Society, and built electric vehicles both for the road and for his grandchildren to drive in the garden. Honor died in 2016.

12/29/2021,"On a mild, drab day in south London Crystal Palace eased their way past the yellow and green substance currently passing itself off as Norwich City of the Premier League with a performance that barely needed to slip out of second gear. The score finished 3-0 at Selhurst Park, but the numbers seemed by-the-by, a result of Palace’s players easing through the entire second half like men stoically seeing out some clock-watching festive obligation.*  Odsonne Édouard scored one, made one and was a constant source of menace whenever Palace chose to press at the seams of the Norwich defence. Will Hughes, who does a fine, spiky job for Palace in central midfield, ran the game before leaving for a rest after 73 minutes. Norwich, for their part, looked bright, neat and almost totally ineffectual. Somehow the table continues to suggest Dean Smith’s team are just three points from safety, but they looked like a zombified presence, bereft of heart and edge. Defeat here makes it five in a row with a combined aggregate score of 14-0, the kind of run even “Comical” Chris Silverwood, mastermind of England’s Ashes meltdown, would struggle to pick the positives out of. Both of these teams are in the dirt right now, although there are of course degrees here. Palace have been battling a Covid/injury/congestion-related meltdown and were on a run of one win in seven. For Norwich the season has simply become a long march to nowhere, a one way conversation where the subject is always the same thing: the inadequacies, the basic lack of stuffing of Norwich City. Odd to think now that back in August there were whispered hopes that this well-run club could somehow “game” the system with its left-field transfer policies. How bad are Norwich? They came to Croydon with three goals away from home all season. At left-back Sam Byram was making his first league start since February 2020. And yet somehow they looked worse than that. A team that offers no expectation of fight or coherence still somehow managed to come across as a mild disappointment, as Palace swatted them aside without really needing to raise the pulse rate. The home team had six Covid-related absentees of their own plus one, Wilfried Zaha, serving a ban for the kind of red card he seems always to be seeking, and which he finally achieved on Boxing Day thanks to an impressively sustained spell of narkiness and petulance. Palace do not tend to win much without Zaha in the team. But then, they do not often get to play Norwich either. It took eight minutes for the first little huff to blow the door in. Will Hughes took the ball on the edge of the box, turned sharply and was tripped by a clumsy challenge from Kenny McLean. Édouard paused over the kick, drifted into a brief state of reverie, then stepped up and rolled it into the corner. Norwich did not sag immediately. Instead, they waited a few moments. This is a team that always seems to be one thrust away from disaster, even as the midfield runs though its neat patterns, as the ball is zipped about with a brittle sense of urgency. Édouard shot into the side netting. Jeffrey Schlupp had a attempt blocked by a desperate lunge. There was a moment of farce as the entire ground waited five minutes for referee Paul Tierney’s microphone to be fixed. At which point Norwich did something fatal, pressing upfield and winning a couple of corners. Palace broke the length of the pitch, the Norwich players hanging back weirdly from Édouard as he made ground down the left, unwilling to engage with this intrusion. His cut back was pinged first time into the far left-hand corner by Jean-Philippe Mateta, the placement rather than the power beating Angus Gunn’s slightly limp dive. Four minutes later it was three, Palace players lining up to tiptoe through the diffuse Norwich cover, before the ball broke to Schlupp. His shot zinged into the far corner from a fine angle. * Norwich might have pulled one back before the break, Byram heading Przemyslaw Placheta’s free kick on to the crossbar from close range. But both teams came out for the second half with a sense that the day was already settled. It took Palace 15 minutes to muster the energy to try to score another goal. Édouard shot just past the post. Placheta had a close-range shot brilliantly saved by Vicente Guaita. And by this point the Norwich end had taken to amusing itself by suddenly bursting out into wild do it yourself celebrations, just for laughs. It looks a long old half-season from here.",Sport/Football,First-half blitz carries Crystal Palace to comfortable win over hapless Norwich,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/28/crystal-palace-norwich-premier-league-match-report
12/29/2021,"It threatened to be a long afternoon for Southampton when Mohammed Salisu was sent off with 51 minutes left to play but Tottenham Hotspur had to make do with a point from this breathless encounter. Antonio Conte may have preserved his unbeaten league record, becoming the first Spurs manager in history to go without defeat in his first seven matches in charge but there was no escaping the air of annoyance in his demeanour at the final whistle, after they failed to build on Harry Kane’s first-half penalty. In fact, Southampton could have snatched victory had Davinson Sánchez not blocked from the substitute Armando Broja after Eric Dier made a hash of a routine clearance midway through five minutes of stoppage time.  Conte was mindful of disrupting the momentum fostered in the last few weeks and so stopped short of radically changing things but decided to give Lucas Moura – arguably Spurs’ star performer in the victory over Crystal Palace on Boxing Day – a breather, until calling on him to replace the muted Dele Alli with an hour gone. Alli, Ben Davies and Harry Winks, all of whom impressed from the off against Liverpool before Christmas, were restored to the starting lineup, but Conte’s fear about his team losing its identity was apparent as Southampton sped into the lead through their captain, James Ward-Prowse. Spurs were shy of rhythm and appeared overwhelmed by Southampton’s desire to play them at their own game as Ralph Hasenhüttl, who made six changes from the win at West Ham, mirrored Tottenham’s 3-4-3 shape. Shane Long, making his first league start for the club in more than a year, glanced an early header wide from a Kyle Walker-Peters cross and then Yan Valery, another player promoted to the starting lineup, pulled a shot wide. Southampton looked sharp and Ward-Prowse put his team in front with a wonderful first-time strike. Alli did not deal with a Salisu long throw and Ward-Prowse hammered a shot that curled away from Hugo Lloris and flew into the top corner. Southampton supporters gasped as replays of the goal appeared on the big screens. But it was clear from early on that Kane was in the mood. He showed great craft to nutmeg Salisu on halfway before drifting past the challenge of Jan Bednarek and slipping a ball through for Alli. Fortunately for Southampton, it was slightly overcooked and Fraser Forster rushed out to smother. A couple of minutes later, Kane spied Sergio Reguilón on the overlap and telegraphed a ball out to the left flank. Walker-Peters tugged at Reguilón’s shirt and the referee, Anthony Taylor, awarded Spurs a free-kick, from which Davies headed in Son Heung-min’s cross from an offside position. Spurs huffed and puffed after falling behind, with Winks lucky Southampton did not profit from him dawdling on the edge of his own 18-yard box. Aside from Kane’s eye for a killer pass, Tottenham looked a little harmless – until Winks killed the Southampton defence with a perfect pass and Salisu chopped down Son. Forster walloped the ball downfield in frustration and Hasenhüttl knew what was coming. Southampton were reduced to 10 men and Spurs pulled level, Kane ruthlessly dispatching a flawless penalty into the top corner. It should have been Tottenham’s cue to make the most of the man advantage but Spurs failed to make Southampton suffer. Conte replaced Reguilón at the interval, wary the wing-back was potentially a misstep from joining Salisu in heading down the tunnel and Southampton continued in a stubborn 4-4-1. Spurs thought they had the lead when Kane took another fine, this time floated, Winks pass in his stride before leathering in with his next touch, but it was ruled offside following a VAR check. A flare thrown on to the pitch from the away end was still billowing smoke as the goal was disallowed. The big let-off was to come, however, with Forster fortunate the referee came to his aid after making a meal of collecting an Emerson Royal cross. Forster failed to gather the ball under pressure from the substitute Matt Doherty and inadvertently backheeled into his own net but referee Taylor intervened.",Sport/Football,Tottenham frustrated by 10-man Southampton after Harry Kane penalty,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/28/southampton-tottenham-premier-league-match-report
12/29/2021,"West Ham were still running hard deep into added time. David Moyes has turned them into one of the fittest teams in the Premier League and they did not look like they needed any rest when Nikola Vlasic finished off this comprehensive win over Watford, making it 4-1 with his first goal in claret and blue. Behind to Emmanuel Dennis’s early goal, West Ham ended up too powerful for Watford. Mark Noble offered authority after coming in for his first start in the league this season, ensuring that the absence of Declan Rice was not felt too keenly. There were fine goals from Tomas Soucek and Said Benrahma, who had an excellent game, and Watford were left to reflect on their eighth defeat in 10 games under Claudio Ranieri. West Ham’s faltering push for Champions League football is not over yet.  Moyes must have feared that the wheels were coming off when his team, who only had 48 hours to prepare after losing to Southampton on Boxing Day, fell behind in the fourth minute. They have struggled at the back since losing Aaron Cresswell, Angelo Ogbonna and Kurt Zouma to injury and their defensive frailties were even more conspicuous because of the absence of Rice, who can usually be relied upon to shut down opposition attacks with his impeccable reading of the game. Watford saw a chance to attack from the start. The hosts had barely trained after having their last three games called off because of Covid, but they did well to hide any signs of rustiness during the early stages. West Ham were pinned back from their own throw-in and when Joshua King crept inside to thread a pass through to Dennis, the striker took what was a half-chance at best by leaving Craig Dawson on the floor with a deft shimmy and using the space to aim a rising shot beyond Lukasz Fabianski. West Ham had to be resilient and trust in their ability. They soon began to dominate. Noble was a calming presence once he had adjusted to the pace of the game and they could have been level before the 10th minute, only for Jarrod Bowen to spurn a decent chance when a loose ball reached him in the area. Watford were too willing to sit on their lead. Michail Antonio had started to torment Franciso Sierralta and Craig Cathcart, Watford’s centre-backs, and it did not come as a surprise when the equaliser arrived in the 27th minute. The pressure had been growing, Benrahma seeing a stunning effort clip the bar, and Ranieri’s side paid for their lack of urgency when Bowen added some incision to a patient move, slipping a pass through for Soucek to spank a low shot past Daniel Bachmann. Moussa Sissoko was the player guilty of dozing off when Soucek made one of his trademark runs from midfield and it was not long before West Ham were ahead. Manuel Lanzini sprayed a cutting ball down the left flank to Antonio and the striker sped clear before picking out Benrahma, who beat Bachmann with the aid of a deflection off Adam Masina. West Ham, who had lost Pablo Fornals to a positive Covid test, had clearly decided Watford’s full-backs were weak links. The tricky Benrahma had the better of Kiko Femenía, who would have to make way for Imran Louza before the interval, and the hosts were fortunate not to fall further behind at the start of the second half. Bowen had volleyed past Bachmann from close range, but a VAR review confirmed that Soucek had fouled Dennis at the start of the move. Watford, who were only able to name eight substitutes, almost took advantage of that reprieve. They countered at pace, pouring bodies forward when Noble sold himself in the middle, and it took a wonderful save from Fabianski to stop Sissoko from making it 2-2. The game turned on that moment. Soon Watford were creating problems for themselves at the other end. Heaven knows what Masina was thinking of when he decided to let an aimless ball drift over his head on the right. The left-back had not counted on Antonio charging past him and aiming a cross to the far post, where more farcical defending ended with Bachmann bringing Bowen down before the ball went behind. Another VAR check confirmed the inevitable and Noble confidently tucked the penalty away. Watford, two points above the bottom three, had run out of ideas. Bachmann made a good block to deny Antonio, but Vlasic would have the final say.",Sport/Football,West Ham and Benrahma end winless run with emphatic victory at Watford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/28/watford-west-ham-premier-league-match-report
12/29/2021,"After enjoying what could be the warmest New Year’s Eve on record, the UK is expected to return to freezing cold temperatures at the start of January. Temperatures are to return to average from New Year’s Day onwards after an unusually mild late December, the Met Office has said.  Low pressure systems moving across the Atlantic were bringing in milder air and wet weather but next week things should return to normal and parts of northern England and Scotland could see frost in the new year. The prediction comes after parts of the UK had a white Christmas, with snowfall in Yorkshire and Scotland. “(After New Year’s Eve) there is a trend for temperatures to return nearer to normal,” meteorologist Craig Snell told the PA news agency. “That’s not surprising as temperatures are way above average.” Snell added: “For this time of year, if we see any clearer slots at night then that does give some risk for frost, particularly across the northern half of the UK.” Normally the UK sees average daytime temperatures of 7-8C in the south and 3-4C in the north in January, he said, with night-time temperatures of 2-3C in the south and 0C in the north. The UK is experiencing an unusually warm end to December, and forecasters believe New Year’s Eve could be the warmest on record, with temperatures set to reach 15C in some parts of the country. Met Office meteorologist Greg Dewhurst said: “The record is 14.8C on New Year’s Eve and that was in 2011. Temperatures look like they’ll be 14-15C (57.2-59F) so it is possible that temperatures could be that value.” Dewhurst said the weather throughout the week will be “on the mild side”, adding: “We’re going to see across the whole of the country, through the rest of this week, temperatures that are above average for this time of year. “The average temperature in the UK around this time of year should be around 7-8C (44.6-46.4F). Going forward, we’re looking at highs of around 12-14C (53.6-57.2F), possibly locally 15C in one or two spots, so it’s going to be well above average.”",News/UK news,"UK to return to freezing temperatures in early January, says Met Office",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/28/uk-weather-freezing-temperatures-early-january-met-office
12/29/2021,"My friend Brian Barnes, who has died aged 77 of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, was a celebrated muralist and a leading light in the community arts movement. Warm-hearted, funny, outspoken and a hugely gifted artist, he created murals around south London for more than 45 years. He was born in Farnborough, Kent, and raised in nearby St Paul’s Cray, the first child of William Barnes, chief executive of the Mullard electrical components company, and his wife, Eileen (nee Hiley), a seamstress at Morphy Richards. His parents supported him in everything and he had a happy childhood. Brian’s first school was Gray’s Farm primary, then Midfield secondary school for boys.  He began a course at Ravensbourne College of Art (now Ravensbourne University London) in 1961, leading to a national diploma in design. There he met Aileen McKeegan, studying fabric design, and they married in 1964. Brian stood out as a determined realist painter and went on to study at the Royal College of Art, where he graduated in 1969 with beautifully composed and detailed work. Moving to Battersea, south-west London, the couple found a leftwing group of friends and became activists, campaigning for better social provision in housing, parks and jobs and protesting against rent rises and the redevelopment of Battersea power station and the riverfront for the wealthy. The necessity of creating art expressing social concerns gave Brian a new direction, and a bolder style for his work. In 1973 he began printing silkscreen posters at home for campaigns. Demand grew and by 1977 his print workshop was producing hundreds of posters for the community. Then came the murals. His first, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, in 1975, was vast, and was painted with 90 volunteers, near Battersea Bridge. On the “good” end were pictures of socialist goals, in the centre a “rainbow” broom swept away the capitalists’ failure. It became a popular landmark. A year later the wall was demolished. Protesters arrived in thousands, Battersea Bridge was closed and the artist arrested. More large scale gable-end murals followed; sunny evocations like Day at the Seaside and Battersea in Perspective. Then anti-war murals: Nuclear Dawn in Brixton, with its threatening skeleton, and Riders of the Apocalypse in New Cross, featuring world leaders riding rockets around a besieged world, above a tender rendering of messages at Greenham Common. There were many more murals for creches, nurseries, schools, towns, estates and railway stations. The Stockwell war memorial, begun in 1999, was the work he returned to often. It is a joyful mural with many images, dedicated to the fallen in the world wars, and celebrating local residents such as Vincent Van Gogh and the second world war special operations agent Violette Szabo, as well as the Windrush immigrants who spent their first night in Britain in the area. Brian was appointed MBE in 2005 for services to the Battersea community.

12/29/2021,"A growing sense of frustration with people who have not been vaccinated against Covid has been creeping into the speeches of senior government figures from Sajid Javid to Boris Johnson in recent weeks. The health secretary has accused those who have chosen not to take up the offer of free vaccination of taking up hospital beds, damaging society and potentially harming their families as well as themselves.  The prime minister also began rolling the pitch for a possibly tougher approach towards the unvaccinated when he spoke of the need for a “national conversation” about how the NHS would cope with the Omicron wave and further new variants. “I don’t believe we can keep going indefinitely with non-pharmaceutical interventions, restrictions on people’s way of life, just because a substantial proportion of the population still, sadly, has not got vaccinated,” he said. Given the libertarian instincts of today’s Tory party, No 10 has followed the path of allowing people to choose freely whether or not to get vaccinated, unless they want to work in the NHS and the care sector. A mandatory vaccination policy would almost certainly result in a challenge to Johnson’s authority from his backbenches. Those same MPs, however, are also opposed to national restrictions that hit all of society to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed. If another Covid wave were to push the health service to the point of collapse, Downing Street would face two possibilities: lock down everyone or reserve the harshest restrictions for the 5 million people who have declined to be vaccinated in the hope it would ease the burden on hospitals and slow the spread of an outbreak. Javid has estimated that 90% of the most severely ill in hospital at the moment are unvaccinated. Some countries have already decided that choosing not to be vaccinated should carry a cost, given the impact on wider society of Covid spreading more quickly among the unvaccinated and the greater potential for hospitalisation. Greece and France went down the Covid passport route as early as July. Israel and Denmark also adopted pass systems early, phased them out, and then brought them back when infections were surging. In Italy, proof of vaccination, recovery or a negative test has been required for many indoor public places since October and a new super-green pass was added in December that is only available to people who have been vaccinated or recovered from Covid in the last six months. All moves by the UK government so far to encourage vaccination have been firmly rooted in persuasion and “nudge” theory. It has been almost all carrot and no stick, even when it comes to Covid passports. Ministers insist they should not be called “vaccine passports” because people will be allowed to show a recent lateral flow test result instead. The approach of encouragement is continuing, with a campaign texting everyone to “get boosted now”. But there also now appears to be an attempt to introduce an element of social stigma to vaccine refusal, and a move to suggest it is people’s civic responsibility to get jabbed. No 10’s view is that there is still scope to drive up vaccination rates further – particularly when it comes to the booster – and that this is preferable to using vaccination status as a dividing line. Almost 90% of over 12s have now had a first dose, 82% have their second and 56.5% are boosted. One major missing piece of the puzzle, currently under consideration, is a strategy that gets to the bottom of why 5 million people remained unvaccinated, especially those in communities with an ingrained distrust of authority. No 10 even turned to an artificial intelligence (AI) company earlier in the year to determine the causes of vaccine hesitancy, but Whitehall sources acknowledge there is still a lack of understanding about how many of the unvaccinated remain so because of entrenched anti-vax ideology, misconceptions that could be turned around, a lack of time or transport to get to vaccine centres, or just apathy. One option being weighed is the idea of greater personal outreach – learning from the personal touch of GPs who have phoned all their most vulnerable vaccine refusers. Ministers are even thinking about teams of door-to-door vaccinators who could deliver shots on the spot. If this last push were not to work, however, and further restrictions are deemed necessary, Johnson may have to confront a difficult choice, unpalatable to his party, about whether everyone – the vaccinated and the unvaccinated – are all in it together any more.",News/World news,What to do about the UK’s unvaccinated?

12/29/2021,"The lurid yellow jacket with bold black lettering on the art historian Anne Marsh’s weighty 2021 tome screams one thing to art lovers and feminists alike: this is not a coffee table book. Although the Melbourne University Publishing volume (weighing in at 3kg) features almost 400 beautiful, confronting and thought-provoking glossy colour illustrations and photographs, Doing Feminism is a rigorous and scholarly critique on how women’s art has influenced and changed the Australian and international contemporary art landscape from a feminist perspective.  Punctuated with artists’ statements, curatorial writing and critique, Doing Feminism is possibly the most comprehensive literary dive into Australian women making art since the 1970s. It took Marsh more than five years to compile, although the author of five other books and professorial research fellow from the University of Melbourne’s Victorian College of the Arts says the idea had been bubbling away for a decade. The subtitle, Women’s Art and Feminist Criticism in Australia, is significant, she says. “There’s a lot of women in the book who wouldn’t be card-carrying feminists, so I was interested in making a juxtaposition between what was happening in the critical literature, in the catalogues and so on, and what artists were doing on the ground.” Along with celebrating individual artists’ achievements, the book is peppered with tales of women’s struggles for recognition in the male-dominated art world of the 20th century. Vivienne Binns’ first solo exhibition at the Watters Gallery in 1967 drew howls of outrage from male and female artists and critics, with her controversial Phallic Monument and Vag Dens singled out for particular ridicule. According to Melbourne’s Potter Museum of Art, the art historian and collector Stephen Scheding wrote that the Binns exhibition “would be the most unprofessional work I have seen in a well-known gallery”. Binns abandoned painting after the exhibition, began experimenting with enamel and took to calling herself a craftswoman. “I’d taken as much as I could take,” she revealed in a 1975 interview in Refractory Girl, Australia’s first women’s studies journal, revealing the toll the works had taken on her personal life. “I’d put myself in isolation and cut myself off from the more enjoyable things in life … I’d made people afraid of me. My images were touching them in areas that they didn’t want to be touched. I felt there was a sheet of glass between me and people. I was very lonely … I’d aged about six years, my face had changed. To other people I’d lost my sense of humour.” A decade after its creation, Vag Dens was bought by the National Gallery of Australia. In 1993 the NGA also bought Phallic Monument. “Specious, ham-fisted, gimmicky, dismal, phoney, unappealing, incomprehensible, shabby, repellent, empty” were just some of the adjectives critics and members of the public used to describe the works of the artist Jenny Watson as she was emerging on the scene in the 1980s. Reflecting on the reaction in a 1999 Art Monthly essay, the artist Virginia Fraser quipped: “After a while you start to think, gee fellas, what’s this about?” Fraser quotes one of Watson’s fiercest critics – Peter Timms, a former editor of Art Monthly. “If I’m honest with myself, I’d have to say, yes [Watson’s] works offend me,” Timms told Fraser. “And it’s because they seem to be saying ‘up you’ to me as a viewer. They seem to be dismissing me … ” Six years after 1987’s public pillory of her seminal confessional work The Key Painting, Watson represented Australia at the 45th Venice Biennale. In 2017 Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art and Melbourne’s Heide Museum of Modern Art both staged major retrospectives of her work. In 2018 the comedian and University of Tasmania art history graduate Hannah Gadsby picked Marsh’s brain for her ABC documentary miniseries Nakedy Nudes, the same year Gadsby attracted international acclaim for her Netflix live standup special Nanette. While primarily known as a contemporary art historian, academic and critic, Marsh is also something of a statistician, crunching the data on gender imbalance in the Australian art scene. In some ways the trend appears to be mirroring the trajectory of Australian female writers, who have dominated prestigious competitions such as the Miles Franklin award for the past decade. Data on Australian females artists’ representation at the Venice Biennale, for example, shows an encouraging trend. Female artists were represented at just three Venice Biennales throughout the 1980s and 90s (Rosalie Gascoigne in 1982; Jenny Watson in 1993; and a joint exhibition by Emily Kame Kngwarreye, Yvonne Koolmatrie and Judy Watson in 1997), but since 2001, Australia has been represented by a female artist in eight of the 10 Venice Biennales. At the first Sydney Biennale in 1973, the work of just one female artist was exhibited, and she wasn’t even Australian. By 2014 women accounted for more than half the works displayed in the show. But when it comes to the collections and retrospectives in many major Australian public galleries, Marsh believes more affirmative action is needed. “A retrospective exhibition for a living artist is the most significant one … and you see the male artists getting those retrospective shows but you don’t see the female artists,” she says. “Making sure our public galleries have as many women as they have men in this field would really change the public’s perspective. “When I talk to people around a barbecue and none of them know a lot about art, when it comes to women artists, they will say ,‘Oh, we know about Margaret Preston,’ and that’s about it. They might go to a gallery twice or three times a year but each time they go, there’s a bloke on. “If one in three times it was a major exhibition of a woman, then they would know more names … so I think that’s a failure on the part of most major institutions – they really need to pick up the game.” Marsh says it was encouraging to see major institutions such as the NGA acknowledge this oversight and move to rectify it.

12/29/2021,"From 1-6 January, Sydney’s Cahill Expressway will be transformed into a music stage. The historic freeway will be the site of a new festival called Elevate, which is delivering a free six-day program of music and performance. Among the line-up is neo-soul artist Ngaiire, who will come with a new album’s worth of songs to show off.  Released in August, Ngaiire’s third LP – aptly titled 3 – explored both her experiences of new motherhood and growing up in Papua New Guinea, where she was born and lived from age seven to 16. Proudly staking claim to the latter was a line in the sand for Ngaiire – in earlier years, she says, she stopped identifying herself as Papua New Guinean because she worried it might impede her music career. At home on the New South Wales Central Coast, a certain quintessential PNG kitchen tool has recently become Ngaiire’s most cherished object. Here, she tells us what that utensil represents to her, as well as the story of two other important personal belongings. Probably our coconut scraper. My parents were living with us for about six months at the start of Covid as they’ve both lost their jobs. So as a thank you to us, they’d do real Backyard Blitz-level renovations on the house and garden, as cute surprises while we’d be out running errands or jobs. Once, we came home and they’d erected a much-needed shelving unit in the laundry and, in addition to neatly stacking all our laundry items on the shelf, they had tucked in a brand new coconut scraper. It’s a staple in most PNG kitchens but big and dangerous enough to need a space somewhere like a laundry. My parents have since moved back to PNG after 20 years in Australia, so I see that scraper as a real representation of their love and sacrifice, but also connection to home. My studio mic. I have a little Røde mic that I won in a competition run by Happy Mag during the start of Covid. They wanted to support artists who were doing it tough while we watched our gig calendars get completely wiped. It’s not a big fancy condenser mic, but previously I didn’t have a proper studio mic at all, and I can honestly say that the only reason I have been able to do most of my vocal sessions remotely and still make money is because of this little USB mic. It’s probably the most used gift anyone has given me in the last two years. My son’s hairbrush! He has the most glorious afro you’d ever see on a three year old but the maintenance on it is a commitment. There are at least four of these plastic pharmacy brushes floating around the house and when “hair washing day” comes along – usually a Sunday – do you think I can find any of them? Heck no! After his hair gets washed, the trick is to lather and brush hair cream through before the moisture evaporates from his curls, then wrap them up in plaits for a few days so you have less knotty hair the rest of the week. When you can’t find a brush in sight, it’s a race against evaporation time to get those curls in plaits, otherwise you’ve gotta be that parent brushing the knots out of his hair the next day while he’s crying through every brush.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Three things with Ngaiire: ‘I see that scraper as a real connection to home’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/29/three-things-with-ngaiire-i-see-that-scraper-as-a-real-connection-to-home
12/29/2021,"Scott Lansbury had his first encounter 25 years ago. It was in the Victorian town of Upper Beaconsfield, close to midnight, where he and his brother saw the animal walking up the footpath across the road from where they lived. “It was bigger than any dog I’ve ever seen,” he recalls. “Bigger than a labrador, bigger than a [German] shepherd.”  Lansbury is convinced the mystery animal, which he says was black and walked with a feline prowl, was a big cat. He says he has seen similar animals several times in the intervening years. “I kept hearing other stories,” Lansbury says. So a decade ago, he started a Facebook group, Black panther sightings in Victoria, “sort of as a joke”. Since then, the group has grown to 36,000 people. Members post a mixture of blurry images and footage, videos of big cats clearly taken in other countries, and avowed testimonies of personal encounters. “I look at every video that’s been posted on the group,” Lansbury says. Sightings of mysterious cats in the wild – and accompanying reports of strange livestock deaths – are not a new phenomenon. Large felids have been rumoured to prowl the Australian bush for nearly 200 years, says David Waldron, a folklorist and historian at Federation University. The earliest reported phantom cat sighting Waldron has identified was near Adelaide, in 1836. A sailor said he had found “a cat-like animal with orange fur, black stripes down its back and white tufted ears, hunting for marsupial rats near a body of water”. In the 1890s, panic erupted in the South Australian town of Tantanoola, when stories emerged of a predator stalking properties, terrifying farming dogs and slaughtering sheep. The exotic animal trade was widespread in the late 19th century, Waldron says. Classified ads of the day offered leopard and panther cubs for sale. The Tantanoola tiger, as it became known, was eventually caught. The beast turned out not to be a felid, but a Eurasian wolf. Equally misplaced in the Australian bush, the wolf was hypothesised to have been a boat stowaway that survived a shipwreck off the coast. It was stuffed and remains on display at the Tantanoola hotel. In the last century, rumours of wild big cats have also been fuelled by stories of escaped circus animals such as lions and tigers, and American soldiers bringing exotic pets into the country as military mascots. In Victoria, sightings have been reported in Gippsland and the Grampians national park, while in New South Wales there have been hundreds of reported sightings of big cats in the Blue Mountains – known as the Blue Mountains panther or the Lithgow lion. Last year, a video of a black cat was captured on Sydney’s upper north shore by a university student, who described it as longer than 1m, “with a body on ‘roids”. To the untrained eye, accurately estimating the size of an animal after a fleeting sighting is a difficult task, says Peter Menkhorst, an ecologist at the Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research in Melbourne. Feral domestic cats – Felis catus – can occasionally reach impressive sizes, and have been behind at least some reported big cat sightings. “If you see a [feral] domestic cat that maybe weighs something like 10kg, which is about twice what most pet cats weigh … your initial impression might be: gee, that’s a big animal,” Menkhorst says. In 2005, a deer hunter, Kurt Engel, shot dead what he believed to be a black panther near Sale, in east Gippsland. He estimated the cat was about 1.5m long. Engel kept the animal’s tail as a trophy, which was 60cm long – roughly twice the length of a regular domestic cat’s tail. However, DNA testing later revealed the animal was actually Felis catus, a large feral cat. In 2012, a report commissioned by the Victorian government concluded that the available evidence was “inadequate to establish that a wild population of ‘big cats’ exists in Victoria”. Menkhorst, who co-authored the report, says the chances of there being unknown big cats out in the Victorian wilderness is “minuscule”. “No one has ever actually brought in a carcass or even a part of one of these mythical beasts.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning One piece of unexplained evidence was a scat found in Winchelsea in 1991. Barbara Triggs, an expert in animal scats, identified the faecal sample as most likely belonging to a leopard, and isolated several hairs from the scat that she believed the animal may have inadvertently ingested while grooming itself. Mitochondrial DNA in the hairs was tested in 2000, and the sequence was confirmed as belonging to a leopard, though the scientist who tested them said he could not rule out contamination. “There’s a lot of uncertainty around the origin of that scat,” Menkhorst says. “It’s very inconclusive.” Menkhorst’s scepticism is also grounded in years of wildlife monitoring. “We’ve done literally hundreds of thousands of what we call trap nights,” he says, where camera traps that detect heat and motion are set out in the bush to monitor continuously for weeks at a time. “We’ve taken millions of photos, literally, and we’ve got nothing we can’t explain, everything from … dunnarts up to dingoes. Lots of feral cats, no other species of cat,” he says. “Given the intensity of fauna surveying we’ve done in Victoria in the last 50 years, it’s an almost inconceivable thing that we would not have found [a big cat] if it did exist.” Waldron agrees. “I am sceptical in that there’s simply insufficient evidence as yet,” he says. “There’s nothing inherently wrong with the idea, you’ve just got to find positive evidence.” Despite the lack of evidence, big cats in the wild have continued to hold a certain appeal. “It re-enchants the bush, it makes it mysterious, magical,” Waldron says. He has joined big cat hunters out on tracking jaunts at night, listening for animal sounds using directional microphones. “It’s quite an exciting and evocative thing to do.” Unexplained livestock deaths may have a simple rather than eerie explanation, Waldron says. “At the heart of these panics is usually stock kills that look different to how they’re done normally by wild dogs. When people have gotten into it forensically – as in the animal mutilation panics in US – what they find causes it is multiple predation on the same carcass by different predators.” A Twitch streamer by the name of Rainey Jay, who lives on the mid-north coast of NSW, has been fascinated for years by big cat stories and online groups dedicated to them. Though she is sceptical about their existence, she says there is something “romantic about the whole notion that maybe there are still some big mysteries out there for people to solve”. “You’ve got people that look for Bigfoot or aliens, but for giant cats living out in the wild, that does have something plausible about it.” The enchantment with the idea of big cats in the Australian wild “overshadows the problem that we have with feral cats”, Jay says. Feral domestic cats, which cover all but an estimated 0.2% of Australia, are both ecologically and economically damaging. It has been estimated that they kill 1m birds a day. “That’s something I think we should look at more,” she says. Lansbury has no doubt he wasn’t mistaken that night 25 years ago, and wants others to keep an open mind. “You can definitely see why people don’t believe in them,” he says. “You’ve got to see it to believe it.”",News/Environment,Tall tails: why does the myth of exotic big cats prowling the Australian bush persist?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/29/tall-tails-why-does-the-myth-of-exotic-big-cats-prowling-the-australian-bush-persist
12/29/2021,"Most – if not all – of us would like memories of 2021 erased from our minds post-haste so we can move on from a year which – just like the previous one – has been aptly and regularly described as a “shitshow”. But moving on, we would want to bring with us the films that helped us through, including several from our national cinema, which offered more than a few treats to break up the chaos and drudgery. It was a particularly strong year for documentaries, with five making this list – three of them exploring artists who have had a profound impact on Australian culture. To qualify for this list, films needed to have had a release outside the festival circuit, either theatrically or on a streaming platform.  The sports movie genre is filled with cheesy stories about triumphing on the field or in the pool, or even in the competitive world of paper plane throwing. Writer-director Tyson Wade Johnston initially seems to be steering Streamline in the rah-rah “must win at all costs!” direction of so many films before, emphasising that teenager Benjamin Lane (Levi Miller) could be a champion swimmer if he buckles down and gives it everything. But the drama becomes something quite different when life, as they say, gets in the protagonist’s way, with major distractions including the release of his father (Jason Isaacs) from prison and the bad influence of a belligerent brother (Jake Ryan). This smart and gripping film is more interested in masculinity (toxic and otherwise) than laps of freestyle. There are two beautiful things at the core of writer-director Katie Found’s feature debut: first, a pair of wonderful performances from Markella Kavenagh and Maiah Stewardson, playing teenagers who profoundly connect during a formative period in their lives; and, second, a lovely and tactile visual style that covers them like a warm blanket. Simple moments (such as one of the girls resting her head against the chest of the other) resonate with complex feelings, and elements that might have felt heavy-handed (such as a ruminative voiceover reflecting on the death of one of the girls’ mothers) feel earned and unpretentious. Found evokes a bittersweet feeling: that precious things can’t last, though they can be remembered always. Sonia Bible’s trippy documentary about artist and self-professed witch Rosaleen Norton is aesthetically audacious, and the so-called “witch of Kings Cross” surely wouldn’t have wanted it any other way. Bible’s film uses all sorts of techniques to illustrate Norton’s life, joining a collection of documentaries that not only investigate Australian artists but channel the look and feel of their work – among them Ecco Homo, Whiteley and Women He’s Undressed. I loved the film’s educationally hallucinogenic vibes: an Australian history lesson thrown into a cauldron. It is a vivid picture of a colourful individual and an ode to the joys of bohemian life, particularly life in the city, where the setting of the sun marks the beginning of a new night rather than the end of a day. The style of British documentarian Asif Kapadia, who assembles his films mostly using pre-existing materials, has been channelled in two electrifying Australian productions: the 2019 Adam Goodes doco The Final Quarter and now Tosca Looby’s account of the sexism and misogyny experienced by Julia Gillard during her time as Australia’s first female prime minister. Strong Female Lead, which belongs to SBS’s Australian Uncovered suite of feature-length documentaries, is shudder and wince-inducing – a catalogue of national shame. It’s important, visceral viewing. Suffering from debilitating dementia, June (a terrific Noni Hazlehurst) suddenly snaps out of it and comes good but is told by her doctors that her newfound lucidity won’t last long. So she does a Randle McMurphy and escapes a nursing home to reconnect with her family. It sounds like the stuff of sentimental mush, but instead June discovers a surreal world outside her known reality in which things have changed for the worse, including through family fallouts – a concept not dissimilar to the classic Australian film Bliss and Peter Carey’s novel on which it was based. Writer-director JJ Winlove juggles dramatic and funny elements, crafting a film about inevitability in numerous forms: the limitations of body and mind, for starters, and also other things we cannot change – such as the nature of relationships between other people. Jane Harper’s page-turning book about a detective investigating a potential murder in a small arid town is an engaging read, but a bit of an airport novel, with a clear genre formula and boilerplate elements. Director Robert Connolly’s sparsely handsome adaptation is an example of a film that’s classier than its source material. Harper’s timeline shifts prove perfect for flashbacks detailing events long ago, when the aforementioned detective (a morose Eric Bana) lived in the town he reluctantly returns to. There are two core mysteries: one involving the distant past when the protagonist may or may not have committed some kind of crime, and the other the present, when there may or may not have been a murder. Sounds vague, but the scripting and direction is pinpoint precise and given atmospheric intensity with a wide-lensed, tinder-dry look. The amazing performers of the Bangarra Dance Theatre take us to places that transcend words. It’s fitting that Wayne Blair and Nel Minchin’s documentary about the group’s history and formation – including the story of artistic director Stephen Page and his family – is crafted with a sense of motion and movement, almost as if it too is dancing. Understanding that this is a story hooked to many things – including art, expression and of course Indigenous culture, both ancient and modern – they create a beguiling kind of history lesson. The Australian government’s abominable handling of the climate crisis is an emotive issue for many of us who have watched in horror as our elected leaders not only fail to act but pour gasoline on the fire. Eva Orner’s gooseflesh-raising documentary, centred around the catastrophic black summer bushfire season of 2019-20, approaches a difficult subject with courage and clarity, spotlighting the contemptible failures of the Morrison government and more generally a world that cannot sustain its devotion to fossil fuel. Many important talking points are canvassed briskly but densely, including the role of the media in fuelling climate denialism, and the differences (in frequency and severity) between bushfires as they used to be and as they are now in a so-called “new normal”. Burning is one of the most important Australian documentaries of the 21st century. About the time that Justin Kurzel’s hauntingly poetic drama about the life Martin Bryant was released, I binge-watched a tonne of films focused on mass shootings – a frankly awful way to spend one’s time, full of the kinds of things Kurzel and screenwriter Shaun Grant (who worked together on Snowtown and True History of the Kelly Gang) assiduously avoid. Their film has no gratuity, no sensationalism, no simple definitions of mental illness, no crude messages about the banality of evil. Every scene in Nitram navigates a minefield of ethical issues; they know every moment will be scrutinised for its implications. It’s challenging but made brilliantly and boldly, with an important message at its core about gun control – an issue that should not be allowed to disappear from the national conversation. The great actor David Gulpilil died late last month after a lengthy bout of sickness following a diagnosis of terminal lung cancer. Molly Reynolds’ amazing documentary plays like a kind of living wake, with one Buñuelian image that has clung to my mind like glue: of Gulpilil lying in a coffin, covered in strips of film, which flow out of it as if they were a natural part of the man himself – or a natural part of the environment from which he emerged. After Gulpilil’s death, many writers (including myself) attempted to articulate with words the magic of Gulpilil’s screen charism – an impossible task. Reynolds recognised that a straight recollection of the actor’s life would have been a disservice to his enigmatic talent, instead crafting a beautifully unconventional film that moves in fluid rhythms, edited as if its cuts and segues were coils of memories.",Arts/Film,From The Dry to My Name Is Gulpilil: the 10 best Australian films of 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/29/from-the-dry-to-my-name-is-gulpilil-the-10-best-australian-films-of-2021
12/29/2021,"The critically endangered swift parrot has returned to Tasmania for another breeding season but, with logging threatening its habitat, the species faces an uncertain future. The world’s fastest parrot is a colourful and secretive migratory bird that ranges across Australia’s south-east before returning to tree hollows in Tasmania’s old-growth forests to breed and raise its young.  The birds’ arrival is timed with flowering blue gum trees, and with different patches flowering each year, the precise location they land changes each season. This year’s sightings began at the end of spring in Lonnavale forest, an area of old-growth in southern Tasmania. Though the parrots have returned in good numbers this year, their future remains uncertain. Without intervention, peer-reviewed research anticipates they will go extinct by 2031. Swift parrot population numbers have collapsed from 8,000 breeding pairs to fewer than 1,000, due mostly to the logging of their habitat. Current estimates put their numbers at about 750 individual birds. Mick Roderick from BirdLife Australia said a “matrix of threats” was putting pressure on the species, both on the mainland and in their breeding grounds. “One of the issues with swifties is that on the mainland they’ve lost their wintering habitat, so they’ve got fewer options,” Roderick said. “Then there’s an issue in Tasmania where the government wants to keep logging.” “They are as threatened as they can be before being extinct in the wild. The next step is extinct in the world.” Logging resumed in 2018 after a brief pause on activity in some sensitive areas of Tasmania. In July last year the Tasmanian government released a wood production plan allowing logging companies to fell areas – referred to as coupes – where the swift parrot is known to breed. Jenny Weber, campaign manager for the Bob Brown Foundation, said a survey undertaken by conservationists last week found a logging operation within 500 metres of swift parrot feeding grounds. “Last week, 124 Australian species were listed by IUCN [International Union for Conservation of Nature] on the threatened species list and if the Swift parrot is anything to go by, it’s not clear the Australian government will do anything prevent their extinction either,” Weber said. “It has been more than six years since the Swift parrot was listed as critically endangered and its habitat continues to be logged and the species is declining.” The operation was temporarily halted after a volunteer informed authorities about the presence of the birds near the logging site. Tom Allen, campaign manager for the Wilderness Society, said the area being logged was “spectacular” and the presence of the critically endangered birds made the idea of logging the area “tragic”. “Anyone wondering why the world’s fastest parrot is going extinct has the answer right there in front of them,” Allen said. “It’s unbelievable that high conservation wood and swift parrot habitat is signed off as sustainable by the Wood Certification Scheme.”",News/Australia news,‘Matrix of threats’: the precarious plight of Tasmania’s swift parrots,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/29/matrix-of-threats-the-precarious-plight-of-tasmanias-swift-parrots
12/29/2021,"Over 40% of Australians believe marijuana should be legalised, a figure that has nearly doubled since 2013, according to new analysis. Australian researchers have looked into changes in public attitudes towards drug use over time, as measured by responses to the National Drug Strategy Household Survey.  The nationally representative surveys, last conducted in 2019, have been collating data on drug use and attitudes every two to three years since 1985. A review of the survey data showed that 41.1% of respondents supported the legalisation of cannabis for personal use in 2019 – a significant rise from 25.5% in 2013. Don Weatherburn, a professor at the University of NSW’s National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre and a co-author of the analysis, said the increase may be linked to growth in marijuana use. The proportion of people who say they have used cannabis at some point in their lifetime has increased slightly over the last 20 years: 33.5% in 2001 up to 38.1% in 2019. “It’s gradually become more prevalent, probably because the law has become less draconian,” Weatherburn said. “Most states now have some form of cannabis cautioning scheme, which makes the drug somewhat less stigmatised than it had been back in the 80s and 90s. “It’s also partly true that the people who first tried cannabis are now in positions of authority in and around government and major institutions,” he said, citing the US, “where they had very harsh laws against cannabis to a situation now where you can legally sell it in many of the American states”. While the researchers found strong support for legalising marijuana for personal use, their analysis showed that support for other illicit drugs was much lower. “Support for legalising ecstasy and cocaine, although still low, has risen significantly since 2013,” Weatherburn said. In 2019, the proportions of people who wanted to legalise ecstasy and cocaine were 9.5% and 8.1% respectively. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The analysis found “a significant shift in support for treatment and education … away from prison and punitive sanctions,” he added. “Even though people are not supporting the legalisation of these drugs, they are supporting a different kind of approach to the traditional imprisonment, high fines, [and] supervised orders.” Weatherburn attributes changing public attitudes to the advent of drug courts in the early 2000s and the success of drug treatment programs, as well as a sharper perceived distinction “between those who use drugs and those who sell them”.

12/29/2021,"Have you read the report? Do you accept the science? Shouldn’t the Great Barrier Reef be put on the in-danger list? These prickly questions are not from a Canberra press conference, but are the lines of attack anticipated by Australian officials when they briefed Angus Taylor on how to respond to a dire new report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  A 12-page list of talking points, obtained under freedom of information laws, gives an insight into how the government prepared for the release of findings that the UN secretary general would describe as a “code red for humanity”. The document – originally marked as “Official: Sensitive” – outlines suggested responses to potential questions as of 11am Monday 9 August – more than two months before the prime minister, Scott Morrison, finally landed a deal with the Nationals to set a target of net zero emissions by 2050. It was compiled by the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources and was attached to a ministerial briefing sent to Taylor, the emissions reduction minister, to prepare for the publication of the IPCC report later that day. It includes preparation for the classic “gotcha” journalistic question: “Have you read the report?” The suggested response is: “I have been briefed on the Summary for Policy Makers that has been publicly released. I understand that the IPCC will release the full report, which is over 2000 pages, in the near future.” The document also pre-empts a particularly biting question about whether the Australian government’s intense international lobbying effort to prevent the Great Barrier Reef being classified as a world heritage site “in danger” was misguided. The anticipated question – particularly forthright given it appears in a government planning document – says: “Your own report into the Great Barrier Reef says that at 1.5 degrees Celsius that the Reef will not survive – does this not now mean it should be on the in danger list?” The suggested response is that the Australian government “has said time and again that global warming is the greatest threat to the reef and that is why we are investing so heavily in adaptation and resilience strategies”. “This report highlights that there is a threat to reefs around the world – not just the Great Barrier Reef – and Australia’s position has always been to look at the issue in that context and not to single out one nation over another under the pretext of the World Heritage Committee.” The document includes a response to the question: “Do you accept the science of the latest IPCC report?” Suggested response: “Yes, the IPCC is a trusted source of scientific advice and its work continues to inform the Australian Government.” A response to a follow-up question: “Why should I trust the science? Are the climate models accurate?” is that previous climate change projections from the IPCC “have been confirmed by real-world observations”. “Past IPCC estimates of global temperature, extreme events and other changes in global systems have proven accurate,” it says. The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, said after the report’s release he would not be “berated into complying” with specific IPCC conclusions, including the finding that global heating “of 1.5C and 2C will be exceeded during the 21st century unless deep reductions in CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions occur in the coming decades”. Joyce said he believed “humans have an influence on climate” but he was “not going to participate in some sort of kangaroo court of now you will agree to every statement I say because the IPCC said it”. The 9 August talking points document shows industry department officials anticipated potential calls to speed up climate action, proposing an answer to the question: “If global temperature increase is likely to reach 1.5 °C in the near term (2021-2040), does Australia need to meet net zero before 2050 to meet Paris Agreement goals?” The suggested response is that Australia “is committed to the Paris Agreement and its goals, as well as to achieving net zero emissions as soon as possible, and preferably by 2050” – the formulation Morrison had used for months before the formal commitment to 2050 was locked in. In a line that will be familiar to anyone who has been observing the government’s climate rhetoric this year, the talking points say: “While ambition and targets are important, it is ultimately action and achievements that matter for the planet. When we make commitments, we meet them, and we are on track to meet and beat our 2030 target.” Officials also anticipated the government being asked whether it was now “too late to act on climate change” and if it should “give up on mitigation” and instead focus on adaptation. The suggested response is to acknowledge it “will be hard to limit warming to 1.5°C” but “we need to continue global efforts to reduce emissions”. A press release issued by Taylor later on 9 August in response to the IPCC report appears to draw heavily on the talking points, with some tweaks. Taylor’s release did not explicitly welcome the IPCC report – even though this was suggested in the talking points – but it did include the proposed language that “it reinforces the need for a coordinated, global effort to reduce emissions”. The talking points document includes the phrase “Australia has a clear plan” – more than two months before the government announced its “Long-Term Emissions Reduction Plan” following negotiations with the Nationals. The latter document noted it was based on existing policies, including the technology investment roadmap. Guardian Australia has previously revealed that the industry department privately advised Taylor in a four-page briefing that the latest IPCC report was “balanced and transparent” and he should expect intensified calls “for more ambitious climate targets, such as net zero emissions by 2050 or earlier”. The talking points document was an attachment to that briefing and was obtained after a follow-up FOI application. Intriguingly, given that the talking points are meant to be usable when responding to media questions, one question and answer was redacted. In blocking that passage of the talking points, the decision maker cited the section of FOI laws that exempts disclosure of information that would cause damage to “the international relations of the commonwealth”.",News/Australia news,‘Do you accept the science?’ Talking points show how Angus Taylor prepared for IPCC report’s release,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/29/do-you-accept-the-science-talking-points-show-how-angus-taylor-prepared-for-ipcc-reports-release
12/29/2021,"A tribunal has overturned a decision by the National Disability Insurance Agency to refuse to fund an assistance dog for an eight-year-old autistic boy. In the latest case where a family has been forced to take the agency to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) over an assistance dog, the tribunal this month ruled in favour of the boy and his mother, more than two years after they first requested the funding.  It comes amid a string of other cases in which NDIS participants have reported seeing their plans cut and with appeals to the AAT having increased by more than 300% this financial year, as revealed by Guardian Australia recently. The boy, whose name was not published by the tribunal, is autistic, has generalised anxiety disorder and ADHD, with the anxiety a “prominent” feature of his life that “impairs his ability to spend time at different places in the community”. His mother also told the tribunal that her son often experienced “meltdowns” at home while his therapists gave evidence that much of their sessions were spent trying to calm him down. Despite several of his treating professionals recommending an assistance dog given his love of animals and the success of equine therapy, the NDIA refused the funding request in August 2019, saying it was not “reasonable and necessary”. The dog, which was to be trained and provided by the Queensland not-for-profit Smart Pups, would have cost the agency $20,000. The tribunal heard the dog would be trained to “lap” (dog places head on the child), “nuzzle” (dog pushes into the child to disrupt behaviour), and “over” (dog lays across the child to provide weighted comfort). The agency told the tribunal there was insufficient evidence an assistance dog would help the boy to regulate his emotions and any impact it did have could also be gained through the purchase of a pet dog, which the family should pay for themselves. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It questioned whether funding for an assistance dog could be considered “value for money”, as required under the NDIS Act, because was no guarantee it would be successful. The agency, represented by an externally funded barrister, also called several expert witnesses, including one who suggested it was possible the boy could harm the dog. The NDIA later cited that evidence to argue the assistance dog’s welfare could be a concern. The tribunal heard the boy previously experienced violent outbursts directed at his mother, but never towards animals, which were his “happy place”. Another expert called by the NDIA backed its call that there was no need for an assistance dog because the support could be provided by an ordinary pet. The boy was represented pro-bono by barrister John Gurr, who said the agency was trying to “downplay the benefits” of an assistance dog by saying it would do “little more than provide a calming influence”. “[The boy] suffers from profound anxiety,” Gurr said. “His anxiety is such that his ability to leave the house and participate in the broader community is severely constrained. “[The boy’s] anxiety – and the meltdowns which follow – have the regular consequence that [he] is often so emotionally dysregulated when he attends his regular therapy sessions that half the time is spent trying to calm [him] down. Much of the benefit of the sessions is lost.” AAT member Kim Parker sided with the family, saying there was evidence an assistance dog was likely to “provide tremendous benefits” and might assist the boy to “improve his communication skills and to have fewer meltdowns”. Parker said it was “ not reasonable to expect [the boy’s] mother to provide a pet dog for [him] as a substitute to him having access to a professionally trained assistance dog.” Unlike a family pet, an assistance dog would also have public access rights to accompany the boy in all public places. The case is one of several in recent months where the agency has refused to fund assistance dogs but had the decision overturned by the AAT. For example, in February, a 63-year-old cancer survivor living with a rare autoimmune disorder gained access to an assistance dog after the AAT ruled in her favour, three years after she first applied to the NDIS. The NDIS minister, Linda Reynolds, pledged in June to work with the agency to get “more consistency in policy and more clarity in terms of animal support”.",News/Australia news,Tribunal overturns NDIA’s refusal to fund assistance dog for autistic boy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/29/tribunal-overturns-ndias-refusal-to-fund-assistance-dog-for-autistic-boy
12/29/2021,"The gratification of an Indian mother at the words “I love your food” is matched by the dread of hearing “I am leaving home”, so when my 10-year-old wistfully announced that he couldn’t wait to move out, my maternal guilt peaked as I tried to figure out why. In the world he inhabited, “every parent” imposed fewer screen restrictions and “no parent” ever expected a child to excel at school. These two assertions made it easy enough for his parents to point out that a combination of excessive screen time and no work seldom gave rise to the ability to move out of home.  But this time, his words sounded less wishful thinking and more genuine desire, moving me to ask why. “So I can get a dog.” After raising three children to the point of relative independence, all I saw was a fourth who would remain needy and dependant. And not for a moment was I fooled by, “You just have to get the dog, we will do everything.” But given the profound fondness Australians have for pets, we simply couldn’t shake off the topic. Friends and the unlikeliest of relatives acquired dogs, sent cute photos and cuter videos, and casually remarked, “Get a dog, they’re so much fun!” But amid the occasional froth these comments ignited, I stayed resolute – we didn’t need a dog to complete our life – and the kids gave up. Until the day their sibling voiced the fact that he couldn’t wait to move out of the house and they murmured their appreciation. Suddenly, the equation shifted: gain a dog or lose a child? Then came the pandemic and, with it, a wonderful reprieve. Rescue homes were emptied of dogs and the cost of buying a puppy from a breeder soared. Every family driven mad by isolation wanted a dog and a hypoallergenic one – the kind we needed – cost a ridiculous $10,000! And then too, there was a waiting list nearly as long as the one for elective surgery. Suddenly my statement of intent, “We can look into it,” was matched by a harrumphing disclaimer, “But I refuse to pay $10,000 for a dog!” Yes, love had a price. I shared my dilemma with my friend who owned dogs, cats, ponies and birds (who probably found me weak for not owning even one pet) and she connected me to her breeder friend whose first ominous words were, “No child should grow up without a dog.” But then lamenting the extortionist pandemic pricing, he maintained that the right price for a puppy should not be outright unaffordable but one that made buyers pause for thought because there was nothing worse than a momentary indulgence quickly abandoned. I found his view so sensible and his love for dogs so endearing that I decided to visit him. When the litter was born, we took a surprise trip to the countryside. I will confess that watching a gel-like mass of blind things clinging to their weary mother (while their father happily chased birds) resurfaced all my previous misgivings but it was too late. Amid squeals of delight, we anointed one of the unclaimed puppies as ours – the breeder put a tag on him and bid us return after eight weeks. The child who wanted to move out of the house was allowed to name the dog. A fan of the cartoon character Garfield, he named the puppy Odie after Garfield’s friend. The choice was passed by unanimous resolution in an Irish-Indian household, where nothing happens unanimously. At eight weeks and not a day later, Odie came home. I warmed to the breeder’s dim view of expensive training programs and his advice that dog owners must take responsibility for instilling the rules at a young age, which sounded just like parenting. So we kept an eagle eye on his propensity to pee on the good carpet and chew shoes in preference to his toys – and he soon learned. One day Odie stole a grape. The vet said he could be fine, need dialysis or die without another window for intervention. I rued that it was the kind of useless “choice” I gave my cancer patients. After the $800 grape heist, we stopped buying grapes. I am glad to say that my worst fears about dog care were not realised. The sink, dishwasher and laundry, loaded but inanimate, might groan for my children’s attention, but Odie is dutifully walked, washed and fed, and endlessly loved because he both demands and merits attention. There is a running joke in our house that I am jealous and resentful of a little dog who has become a big hit, but in truth my heart catches when, in the quiet of the night, I hear one of the kids telling Odie their day was better because of him. We strive to parent our children in wholesome ways – I underestimated the added dimension of love and responsibility that a dog would teach mine. On a hot day, my daughter cut short her outing to check if Odie had enough water. When Odie was sick, her teenage brother made fresh broth and patiently fed it to him. Such acts of reciprocity are hard to manufacture and, if a dog quietly teaches my children how to give and receive love, I am all for it. Odie turned one this week. You should have seen the toys and treats, although I drew the line at the high-top dog sneakers with matching socks. My in-laws ended up with Odie’s cousin,Rory, who brings them unparalleled joy in retirement. My children no longer talk about leaving home because there is the vexed issue of who will take the dog. The obvious compromise is living together for a long time or being close enough to each other to freely visit. I am realistic enough to know that this might not hold true in the moder world but, if having a dog means knitting my children even closer together, it will be a mother’s prayer answered.

12/29/2021,"The New South Wales government’s Covid contact-tracing system has been all but abandoned, with efforts now focused only on those in the highest risk categories. NSW Health authorities are under increasing strain as the Covid Omicron variant pushes up hospital admissions, while its virulence means contact tracers have all but given up tracking its spread in the wider community.  A senior NSW Health official has revealed to Guardian Australia that tracing would now only be done for only those in aged and disability care, Indigenous communities and prisons. He said, even then, staff were “flat out keeping up” with cases. “There’s a big internal discussion about whether tracing is still worthwhile,” he said. “People are asking ‘what’s the point of it? What are we trying to achieve?’” With another day of long waits for Covid testing on Tuesday – and some sites turning people away – NSW politicians traded barbs over the seriousness of the state’s growing caseload. NSW premier Dominic Perrottet dismissed claims by the Labor opposition the hospital system was at a breaking point as “utterly irresponsible” and “reckless”. He conceded, though, staff were stretched as the state recorded more than 6,000 new daily cases on Tuesday, with 557 people in hospital, including 60 in intensive care units. “We have the best doctors and the best nurses who have worked tirelessly and I know there is exhaustion,” Perrottet said. “We’re in a very strong position here in the state. We are opening up, we are learning to live alongside the virus.” However, Ryan Park, Labor’s health spokesperson, said that with more than 2,000 health staff furloughed because of Covid contact or infection, it was time for the government to call in extra help. “We’ve got to be honest about this,” he said. “If they need federal government support, if they need federal government resources and assistance, and we have a national cabinet, ask for that help and assistance now.” Within the health system there is a growing fatigue after months of battling to contain different Covid variants, particularly Delta and now the more virulent Omicron strain. Guardian Australia revealed yesterday that exhausted New South Wales health workers were being pressured to return from Christmas leave as hospitals and testing facilities are crippled by surging Covid numbers and staff furloughs. About 2,000 health workers have been furloughed across the state after being listed as close contacts, prompting NSW Health to slash the isolation time for health workers from two weeks to seven days, provided they return a negative PCR test. Perrottet has called for the focus to shift away from case numbers. “What is most important as we move through this next phase is our ICU numbers, [our] hospitalisation numbers,” he said. Hospitals, though, were bracing for further increases in patient numbers, with new Covid admissions more than doubling since mid-December. Just over half of those presenting are positive for the Omicron variant, with the rest having Delta. One senior doctor said the number of new cases in NSW was likely far higher than 6,000 a day since many people were not able to get tested or weren’t bothering to do so. If numbers in hospitals kept rising at the current rate “by late January, we’ll be overwhelmed”, the doctor said. For now, though, big hospitals in Sydney, such as Liverpool in the south, have spare capacity which they did not have at the height of the Delta wave. Perrottet said the government had made changes to the definition of close Covid contact for health workers that would allow an extra 1,000 health staff back to work. Previously staffers were unable to work following exposure to a Covid case for a fortnight, and this furlough had now been cut to seven days, he said. Gerard Hayes, NSW state secretary of the Health Services Union, said the hospital system was not at breaking point, and the high take-up of vaccines and now boosters was making a big difference. “The presentations at hospitals are not as bad as what they were during Delta,” Hayes said. “However, bit by bit, they’re sort of increasing.” “There’s a fear within our members [who were] seeing a light at the end of the tunnel, and now that light’s disappearing,” he said. “There’s a lot of apprehension, a lot of fatigue, and a lot of frustration.” Park said the government needed to “get in front of it and ensure that an exhausted system is brought back to life” with some help from the commonwealth or elsewhere. The help could include putting more staff into testing clinics or vaccination hubs to free up staff for clinical work. “I think the community at the moment don’t really care where they get that help from, but they can understand that [it’s needed] when they’re waiting in a queue for six or seven hours to get a test, or they’re waiting days on end to get test results,” Park said. “They understand they need more resources and they would expect I think governments to be working cooperatively at all levels.”",News/Australia news,NSW scales back Covid contact tracing as health system faces Omicron strain,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/29/nsw-scales-back-covid-contact-tracing-as-health-system-faces-omicron-strain
12/29/2021,"Most of Australia will swelter through New Year’s Eve as the heatwave hitting Western Australia moves across to the south-east of the country. And elevated fire danger levels across parts of south-eastern Australia could affect New Year’s Eve celebrations.  While the heatwave in WA was expected to ease on Thursday, bringing much-needed relief to the state, other parts of the country would begin to feel its effects. Sarah Scully, a senior meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, said the conditions “are expected to gradually ease over the next couple of days with the focus of the extreme heat shifting across to south-eastern Australia”. “We’re forecasting severe heatwave conditions for South Australia through Victoria and also for parts of Tasmania leading into the weekend.” Heatwave conditions ease for much of WA later this week, while Severe Heatwave conditions build across southeast Australia. A heatwave occurs when max and min temps are unusually hot over a 3 day period and can have serious health impacts.

In Queensland and the Northern Territory, some rain was expected. In Sydney a high of 29C was forecast, while Victoria was expecting a scorching 34C on Friday. With temperatures in Adelaide expected to reach up to 36C, the country fire service assistant chief officer, Brett Loughlin, said the CFS was preparing for extreme heat and dry conditions across the state. Loughlin said fire services would be working closely with planned events on New Year’s Eve, but could not rule out the possibility that celebrations would be cancelled or modified. “It could very well be that if conditions aren’t conducive to allowing safe use of fireworks then we might see those events … cancelled or conducted differently. “Exceptions can be made where there are suitable precautions put in place,” said Loughlin. But he added it was “too early to give people that sort of hope that things can safely go ahead.” Loughlin encouraged residents of south-eastern SA to take measures to prepare themselves, including creating a bushfire action plan and staying informed. “Have the radio, have social media, … our website, the ABC, a broad range of information sources.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He also urged people to work cooperatively with the CFS and observe the bans in place. “We don’t want our brave volunteers to be seeing in the new year risking their lives somewhere just so someone could have their 30 seconds of whiz-bang.” Highs of more than 40C were forecast for inland south-eastern Australia. “[It] is hot, but it’s not record-breaking territory,” Scully said.
