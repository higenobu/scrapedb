3/2/2022,"Russian forces in Ukraine moved to tighten their siege of key cities, including the capital, Kyiv, and the southern port of Mariupol, as one mayor told residents he had been given an ultimatum to surrender or the city would be razed by shelling. At an outdoor meeting Artem Semenikhin, the mayor of Konotop, in the eastern Sumy region, told residents: “They have given us an ultimatum. If we start resisting, they’ll wipe out the town using artillery. That seems related: https://t.co/YWJfjkolHU “If you are for it, we’ll fight,” Semenikhin is heard telling a crowd of residents. “Who votes to fight?” he shouts as residents, shouting back insisting they will resist. Amid renewed heavy shelling, the mayor of Kharkiv, also in the country’s east, said he had no intention of surrendering. With shortages of food already biting and mounting concerns over the ability to operate hospitals in besieged areas, some western officials privately began raising fears that Russian forces would use the same tactics as those used against civilian populations during the Chechen and Syria wars, which involved scorched earth tactics. Officials and defenders in the southern port of Mariupol on Wednesday became the latest city to say they were surrounded, with Russian troops shelling civilian sites, including residential blocks, hospitals and dormitories for people displaced by fighting. One soldier in the city, reached by the Guardian, said it was clear Russian forces were attempting to encircle and besiege them. “Right now there is active fighting for the city and it is only accessible to one side. There’s constant shelling,” he said, adding he was being moved to the front line. “We believe they they want do the same to Mariupol as they are doing to Kyiv and Kharkiv. They are trying to encircle us and wipe us out with artillery. They want to kill civilians and damage civilian infrastructure. That’s what we need top stop them doing.” “They have been flattening us non-stop for 12 hours now,” the Mariupol mayor, Vadym Boichenko was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying. “We cannot even take the wounded from the streets, from houses and apartments today, since the shelling does not stop.” In Kyiv, which is also encircled by Russian forces, , the mayor, Vitali Klitschko, wrote in an online post on Wednesday. “We are preparing and will defend Kyiv! Kyiv stands and will stand.” The shift in tactics follows a Pentagon assessment that Russia has begun pivoting to crude siege tactics around a number of cities since the beginning of the week amid fears that they may include shutting off access to supplies for trapped civilian populations with Moscow’s strategy in Chechnya and Syria – where it used artillery and air bombardments to pulverise cities – being seen as a model. Adding to those fears Britain’s Ministry of Defence said it had seen an increase in Russian air and artillery strikes on populated urban areas over the past two days. Commenting on the move to besiege cities, Malcolm Chalmers of the Royal United Services Institute told the Guardian the new approach suggested both failures in Russian intelligence in the run-up to the invasion and failures of Russians tactics as the invasion first began. “It appears that Putin was advised that his would be much easier than it has been and the Russians have made a number of mistakes early on. “While there have been a lot of issues with this operation including problems with logistics and air support what the Russian armed forces are good at is artillery and missile fire, which is why we are seeing a move to siege tactics. “But both options have issues. If they have to go block to block fighting, that will be difficult and they will take casualties. Even in Iraq when very well coordinated Iraqi forces went into Mosul [against Isis] backed by Nato air support, it was very slow. And every day that passes gives the Ukrainian defenders more time to dig in. “If they shell from outside the cities in the hope they will surrender that has significant consequences for the civilian populations inside.” US defence officials noted the same changes in tactics, saying that Russian forces were “regrouping” making more use of a multiple rocket-launch system that can employ unguided cluster munitions and thermobaric rounds. Echoing that view, Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at CNA, a Virginia-based thinktank, told the Washington Post: “I’m seeing reorganisation. They’re coalescing into larger units, they’re pulling up logistics and they’re starting to use more artillery and air power.” Commenting on the change in Russian tactics, Ukraine’s president, Voldomyr Zelenskiy, said the escalation of attacks on crowded area amounted to “terror”. “Nobody will forgive. Nobody will forget,” he vowed after Tuesday’s bloodshed on the central square in Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city, and the deadly bombing of a TV tower in the capital. He called the attack on the square a “frank, undisguised terror” and a war crime.",News/World news,‘Constant shelling’ as Russian forces lay siege to key Ukrainian cities,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/constant-shelling-as-russian-forces-lay-siege-to-key-ukrainian-cities-kyiv-mariupol
3/2/2022,"Elden Ring has a Metacritic rating of 97%. If you type its name into Twitter you will be flooded with praise and anecdotes from players who have already spent many hours immersed in its arcane world. But what exactly is it? Why are people obsessed with it? And should you join them – or is it too hard? Elden Ring is the latest game from veteran Japanese studio FromSoftware, the creators of the critically acclaimed Souls series, which began with 2009’s Demon’s Souls and continued through the Dark Souls trilogy. It’s an open-world role-playing adventure set in a ravaged place known as the Lands Between, where the destruction of the titular artefact has led to wars and chaos. You play a warrior tasked with restoring the ring and becoming ruler of a new kingdom. If you’ve played a Witcher or Elder Scrolls game, you’ll get it pretty quickly. Essentially, you will be exploring a vast kingdom filled with castles, caves and spooky dungeons, and fighting a menagerie of monsters from tiny imps to lumbering trolls and fire-breathing dragons. While doing this, you will also meet non-player characters who give you challenging quests and, if you’re lucky, valuable rewards. As in classic tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons and Warhammer, your character has a mass of stats for health, strength, intelligence and so on, and can collect and customise weapons and spells to improve their combat skills. This inventory management element is much more complex than you’d see in, say, an Assassin’s Creed game: intricately defining your character and what they’re wearing to your own specific playing style is a major obsession for fans of FromSoftware’s games. You’ll also have to learn about concepts such as Super Armour, stance breaks, broken pots and critical hits, as well as things called Ashes of War, which add special powers to your armaments. It is a lot. A lot of people have said that Elden Ring is what The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild would be if it hated you. That’s a pretty good analysis. It is a vast game with beautiful and diverse landscapes, a terrifying menagerie of monsters, and an incredibly deep levelling up system that rewards experimentation and personalisation. Director Hidetaka Miyazaki is a game-design genius who thinks deeply about games and how they function. There is always room for player interpretation, and the plotting is subordinate to interactivity. There are so many things to discover in the world that you find yourself constantly wanting to talk about it and compare experiences. I never really understood this with the Dark Souls trilogy but I get it now. With FromSoftware titles, you’re not just buying a game, you’re joining a community – a lot of the fun of the game is what happens outside of it. No, it’s not. It’s just exacting and uncompromising. The major fights can never be won by charging in and waving your sword about. Video game soundtrack composer Christa Lee made a really interesting point on Twitter: she said the fights actually work more like turn-based battles from classic Japanese RPGs. You make your attack move, then you need to wait to see how the enemy responds, counter that with a parry or a dodge, then take your turn to strike again. It’s all about reading attack patterns, working out the best distance at which to engage the enemy, and ensuring you have the correct weapons and knowledge for the job. It’s easy to panic when faced with, say, a 20ft-high troll who can wipe your health bar with one swipe of his hammer. But when you figure out how slow that swipe is, you can concoct a plan of attack. The difference between Elden Ring and Dark Souls is that if you’re getting completely mugged in Elden Ring, you can usually just run away or ride off on your phantom horse. There is much more room for being useless. And the good thing is, death isn’t all that expensive in Elden Ring: you’ll drop all your runes (the game’s currency) but, if you can get back to where you died without dying again, you can pick them up. Just make sure, in the early part of the game, you spend everything you make on weapons, recipe books for crafting and levelling up. Don’t hoard cash. Also, look for skulls with glowing eyes – they’re lying everywhere in the game world and they contain golden runes which aren’t lost when you die. It’s like having a credit card but, you know, more mysterious. Also, as with other FromSoftware games, you can call in other players to help you with key encounters. Just use the game’s crafting system to make a Furlcalling Finger Remedy and strangers will be drawn to your location to give you a hand. There is also an important early item called Lone Wolf Ash, which provides you with a pack of spectral wolves who’ll attack your opponents and save you a lot of damage. Sometimes you can get different enemies to attack each other. I managed to wipe out almost all the soldiers guarding the Fort Haight by leading a couple of demi-human soldiers up to their position and letting them all fight it out. It was glorious. However, the game is always ready to teach you a hard lesson. Margit the Fell Omen is the first major boss at the opening of the second section, Stormveil Castle, and he is an absolute beast with multiple devastating attack patterns. Don’t even think about it until your character hits level 20 and has seriously augmented weapons or an array of spells and incantations. Yes! Like Breath of the Wild, you are free to explore the entire map of Limgrave, and all the systems and objectives are discovered as you go, so it’s worth spending time just wandering around and investigating interesting things. There are no quest markers, no lists of side-tasks to tick off, no pictorial menus to endlessly flick between, no radio masts to switch on (I’m looking at you, Ubisoft). You go out and you interact with the world. I’ve had countless moments of discovery, from finding powerful weapons lying in swamps to battling giant crabs and descending into mines filled with rabid zombie dogs. For someone who struggled with the rigidity of the Dark Souls games, Elden Ring is a revelation. Find the weapons and armour that feel good for you. Experiment with swords, spears and bludgeoning weapons such as clubs and maces, and get to know which options work best on which enemies. Ranged combat is always a good tactic, so get into magic or use a bow. Don’t forget to target enemies during fights (press down the right analogue stick). That is the only way you’ll hit them with arrows and throwing knives. Learn the jumping attack, where you jump on an enemy and slash them with your sword – it’s great for breaking their attack patterns, leaving them vulnerable to a followup. Practice the timing on softer foes. Stay in the opening section Limgrave for as long as you can bear it before taking the next step into Stormveil Castle. You can do some serious levelling up, find lots of useful kit in the dungeons, and be much more prepared for the challenges to come. Use guides. Eurogamer and GamesRadar both have in-depth guides to the game and they’ll clue you in on stuff you may have missed. If in doubt, get on an Elden Ring Discord or Reddit. The key lesson I’ve learned so far is that you never have to be alone in this game.",Arts/Games,A beginner’s guide to Elden Ring: what it is and why you should play it,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/mar/02/elden-ring-beginners-guide-open-world-adventure
3/2/2022,"Britain’s biggest housebuilder, Persimmon, has announced profits of nearly £1bn in 2021, but cautioned that the Ukraine invasion could disrupt the the UK economy in the year ahead. Persimmon’s profits jumped by nearly a quarter to £970m thanks to “positive pricing conditions” in every British region in which it operated, as the house price boom defied the coronavirus pandemic, it said on Wednesday. Dean Finch, Persimmon’s chief executive, said he was “mindful of the growing risk of an economic impact as a result of the tragic conflict in Ukraine”, but that he expected continued house price rises to “mitigate build cost inflation”, suggesting higher costs for materials and labour would be passed on to buyers. “The UK housing market remains supportive with demand continuing to exceed supply, favourable interest rates and good levels of mortgage availability,” he said. Persimmon said it had some built-in protection from increased materials costs, which could be further escalated by the Russian invasion, because it had increased capacity at factories producing timber frames, bricks and tiles. Vistry, the sixth biggest London-listed housebuilder, also announced bumper results on Wednesday, saying it had more than tripled its annual profits to £320m. Housebuilders in the UK have benefited from years of strong demand, thanks to a dearth of new homes. Nationwide, the UK’s largest building society, reported on Wednesday that prices of homes on which it offered mortgages increased by 12.6% in the year to February, with the average price crossing the £260,000 mark for the first time. Many analysts had expected the pandemic to end the extraordinary price increases, but a combination of unprecedented low interest rates and employment support schemes caused prices to defy lockdowns. The UK government indirectly fuelled house price growth by temporarily cutting stamp duty, a subsidy that has now been removed. Housebuilders have already set aside the costs of removing flammable cladding, found to be a key cause of the Grenfell Tower fire that killed 72 people. Persimmon built 14,550 new homes in 2021, 1,000 more than 2020 when housebuilding was temporarily disrupted by the first pandemic lockdowns. Its rate of private sales was 22% ahead of 2019, before the pandemic struck. Vistry built 8,600, more than in 2019. Both companies expected to improve on 2022. Vistry said it predicted a “significant step up in profits and returns in 2022”. Persimmon said it would increase sales volumes by 4-7% in 2022, while keeping similar profit margins. That would suggest a return to above-£1bn profits, a level previously seen only in 2018 and 2019. Persimmon shares gained 6.4% on Wednesday morning. Shares in Vistry, which was formed in 2020 from the merger of Bovis and Galliford Try, gained 6.6%. Yet some analysts question whether the housebuilders’ strong run can continue over the next year. Consumer price index inflation has risen to its highest level in 30 years, squeezing household incomes, with more increases to come next month. Economists expect the Bank of England to increase interest rates further this year, which could also dampen demand. “The backdrop is changing,” said Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, a restructuring consultancy. “House price growth this year is expected to be more muted and we have to question whether Persimmon will be able to absorb ever-increasing costs through higher selling prices.” Vistry’s chief executive, Greg Fitzgerald, said there had been “strong demand across all areas of the business”. He added that the company had experienced “extended lead times and inflationary pressures on certain products”.",News/Business,Persimmon profits jump to nearly £1bn as UK house price boom continues,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/02/persimmon-profits-jump-to-nearly-1bn-as-uk-house-price-boom-continues
3/2/2022,"Ali, 14, wants to be a criminal lawyer, but also to go to the US and be famous. Callum adores wrestling but doesn’t think there’s a future in it – he’s a reader, not a fighter. Ierum wants to make the world a better place, but first she has got to concentrate on the tricky art of switching friendship groups. And Annabella, well, she suspects we’re on the verge of the apocalypse. And she might not be wrong. If you set out to create a dozen teenagers with whom to hang out with for three hours, you’d struggle to write a more heart-stealing bunch than those in Our Generation. And since this is a play by Alecky Blythe, master of verbatim theatre, there is nothing fabricated about them at all – these are real young people, followed across five years of their lives, captured from hundreds of hours of interviews and rendered with immaculate observation by a brilliantly charismatic cast in Daniel Evans’ production. We watch their stories across a chain of thematically interlocking vignettes as they navigate their way through school, relationships and challenging home situations. There’s no central character as such although Luan, the basketball prodigy falling for his own hype, gets the most dramatic scenes as his Kosovan parents struggle to rein in his strutting behaviour. Hélder Fernandes’ compelling performance makes him a star of the show, especially in the push and pull of scenes around the family dinner table, with Hasan Dixon as his loving but sometimes bewildered father. There are beautiful performances all round, however. Gavi Singh Chera and Anushka Chakravarti fill the stage as Birmingham brother-and-sister Ali and Ayesha, equally obsessed with the Kardashians and Primark; their comic double-act turns out to contain the most surprising and sobering story of all. Rachelle Diedericks is utterly endearing as Ierum, which makes it even harder to watch her weather her body-image worries and self-doubt, as a 12-year-old black girl unsure she belongs among her “prettier” classmates. Stephanie Street and Debbie Chazen join Dixon in playing the adults with whom these teenagers interact – parents, teachers, coaches, priests – and their kaleidoscopic and compassionate portrayal of the care and culture surrounding them gives us insight into where each young person is coming from. Some, like Mia and Annabella, must contend with daily hardship and even danger outside the school gates. Others, like private-school head boy Lucas (a delightful blend of comedy and compassion from Joe Bolland), are slowly becoming aware just how privileged they are. The contrast between the two is not overplayed by Blythe, however; she allows all of her subjects to shine, whatever their circumstance. It’s the social pressures that we see in common here, be it in south London or north Wales, and Evans captures them in choreographed set pieces, odes to Instagram and TikTok. By the time the second interval arrives, you feel you’ve known these youngsters for years, and indeed the show could happily end with their optimistic statements of hope for the future. But the pandemic struck while Blythe was still researching, and introduced a new narrative impossible to ignore: she captures it in a half-hour third section that feels like a coda to what has come before. And if the teenagers’ resilience shines through, most heartening of all is the way this magnificent project honours the period of youth it captures on stage: a time of energy, passion, warmth and humour. Blythe’s methods tell the teenagers’ stories from their own perspectives and treats them as the people they are – not the ones adults hope them to become.  Our Generation is at the National Theatre, London, until 9 April and at Chichester Festival theatre, from 22 April to 14 May.",Arts/Stage,Our Generation review – magnificent verbatim account of teenage life will steal your heart,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/02/our-generation-review-dorfman-london-alecky-blythe
3/2/2022,"For more than 20 years, Andy Carter spent his free time scouring muddy fields, stubbornly convinced that he would strike gold. Then one day he did. The retired research scientist from north Norfolk unearthed an extremely rare gold “leopard” coin, dating back to the reign of Edward III. Next week it is expected to fetch up to £140,000 at auction. “I just felt numb when I found it,” Carter said. “And then I did the gold dance.” Carter’s leopard florin is one of three gold finds being auctioned this month. A Saxon gold shilling found by Mark Pallett, a drainage engineer from Essex, is estimated to be worth £10,000, and a 12th-century gold cross, unearthed by Jason Willis, a Norfolk builder, is expected to fetch £8,000. Their discoveries are evidence of a “golden age” of metal detecting, according to Dix Noonan Webb, the Mayfair-based specialist auctioneer and valuer managing the sales. More than 30,000 detectorists are active in the UK and unprecedented finds are rescued from the ground on a daily basis, the company said. The leopard florin dates from January 1344 and was minted in 23-carat gold at the Tower of London. It had a face value of three shillings or 36 silver pennies and was in circulation for only seven months before it was withdrawn. “It is in very fine condition and retains light surface marks consistent with a field find,” said Nigel Mills of Dix Noonan Webb. “Only five are known to still exist and this is by far the finer of the two known specimens that have come to auction.” Two of the coins are now in the British Museum and a third is at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. Carter, who takes his metal detector out most weekdays since retiring four years ago, said he “just got lucky”. He found the coin at the end of a charity day, known as a rally, involving about 30 detectorists on a farmers’ field near Reepham, north Norfolk, in October 2019. “There were only three of us still looking – everyone else was packing up. The coin was covered in mud, about 10 inches down. When I brushed off the soil, I saw the hind leg of a big cat. I thought: ‘It can’t be a leopard – they’re as rare as hen’s teeth’. I called one of the experts over and his eyes were on stalks,” he said. Pallett, 55, who has been a detectorist for 40 years, had a sense he was going to find something significant when he began searching a stubble field in south Cambridgeshire in early January this year. Turning on his detector, he found it had a low battery “so I knew I didn’t have long”. Within 15 minutes, he got a faint signal and discovered what he thought was a small button four inches below the surface. “I turned it over and saw a helmeted bust, and thought: ‘Oh my God’.” The gold shilling, just 13mm in diameter, is in fine condition, said Mills. “The design is based on an obsolete Roman coin of the emperor Crispus from the 4th century AD … Only eight examples of this ‘Crispus’ type have been recorded on the early medieval coins database at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.” The medieval gold cross found by Willis three years ago in a Lincolnshire field is thought to have originated at a hermitage in the nearby hamlet of Throckenholt. “Between 1293 and 1305, records show that Abbot Odo of Thorney ordered that two or three monks should reside there … Fragments of stone, bones and other relics have been found on this site at various times,” said Mills.",News/UK news,"Rare ‘leopard’ coin unearthed in Norfolk expected to sell for £140,000",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/02/rare-coin-unearthed-norfolk-reach-140000
3/2/2022,"European countries are selling so many shark fins to Asia that they dominate nearly half the trade, a study has found. Shark populations continue to decline, driven by the global shark fin trade. Last year, scientists found a third of sharks and ray species have been overfished to near-extinction, jeopardising the health of entire ocean ecosystems and food security for many countries. The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) analysed almost two decades of customs data in three major Asian trading hubs from 2003 to 2020. It found that while the main market for fin-related products is in Asia, EU countries – led by Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, France and Italy – are a significant player in supplying this legal market. China is a big supplier of shark fins but was not covered by the study. Spain was by far the top source of imports of shark fin to Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, supplying 51,795 tonnes, from 2003 to 2020, an annual average of 2,877 tons, ahead of Singapore, with 17,006 tonnes, the report found. More than 50% of the global shark fin trade is in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan province, the report says. Barbara Slee, the IFAW’s report’s author, said: “Small or large, coastal or high seas, shark species are disappearing, with the piecemeal management efforts to date failing to stop their decline.” She called for the EU to take a leading role by limiting its trade in sharks to protect them from extinction. IFAW want all sharks traded to be listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites) appendix II, which would afford them greater protection and monitoring. EU countries are banned from “shark finning”, a practice outlawed in many jurisdictions where fins are removed while the shark is still alive, with the fish then discarded. But the landing and sale of whole sharks is permitted, except for species listed by Cites. “Effective fisheries management is often not put in place until a population is very low or threatened, but when it is in place, shark populations have been shown to recover,” Slee said. “As demonstrated in our report, the EU is a key player in global shark markets and it has an important responsibility to enact sustainability requirements.” Only a quarter of shark products are subject to import and export controls that prove they are legally and sustainably sourced, Slee said. The study, Supply and Demand: The EU’s role in the global shark trade, found 188,368 tonnes of shark-fin products were imported into Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan province from 2003 to 2020. The EU was responsible for 28% or 53,407 tonnes. Since 2017, as the trade declined, the EU’s proportion of exports to these countries has risen to 45% in 2020. Stan Shea, of the ocean conservation group BLOOM Association Hong Kong, and the report’s co-author, said: “Although many place the burden of change on the consumptive countries, primarily in Asia, equally responsible for declines in shark populations are all countries with internationally operating fishing fleets and trade in shark products.” The report also found data discrepancies in import and export figures, suggesting potential misreporting in the trade in shark fins.",News/Environment,"European countries dominate half of Asian shark fin trade, report reveals ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/02/european-countries-dominate-half-asian-shark-fin-trade-ifaw-report-reveals
