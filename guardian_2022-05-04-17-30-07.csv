5/4/2022,"The US was shaken earlier this week by the news that Roe v Wade – the ruling that gives American women the constitutionally protected right to safe and legal abortion – could be overturned. If the leaked ruling by the supreme court does come into effect abortion would be a matter for individual state legislatures and Congress to rule upon. The change would mean women and girls no longer having the same rights their mothers and grandmothers fought for if Republican-controlled states move quickly to end abortion access and Republicans in Congress attempt to enact a nationwide abortion ban. Leading US women’s rights activists and scholars tell us how they feel about the news. As someone who had an illegal abortion – in my home town of Chicago in 1969, four years before Roe v Wade – I was very angry when I heard the news. I am very angry. For women, our destiny has always been our biology, and we’ve fought for ever to change that, to ensure that we’re respected and protected as whole human beings, equal to men under the law. I had an abortion because I got pregnant accidentally. I was just about to go to university – I couldn’t become a mother. There was this doctor who performed abortions after-hours. I paid him and he made sexist jokes the entire time he was performing the procedure. He even told me what gender the foetus was. I got no aftercare, no counselling – and I needed it. I still need it, after all those decades. I was in the wind, because I was breaking the law. Know this: women will always get abortions, and the overturning of Roe v Wade would mean we will once again be at risk. It means that men and women are not equal under the law, based on our biology. It’s the same thing as saying that a human being is not equal under the law based on the colour of their skin. Both are things that cannot be altered. I hope that the US people will vote out of office the Republicans who have pushed for this to happen. British people should care that abortion access could be being repealed in the US, because what the US does, Britain always imitates. We must all keep fighting. We won’t be defeated. It’s amazing and incomprehensible that a draft of a supreme court decision was leaked. That talks to the unusual times we’re living in. The potential overturning of Roe v Wade is symbolic of a larger worldwide push against progress that manifested as much in the Taliban restricting women’s rights to education again. It’s the story of pushing forward and pushing backwards. We’re in a period of pushing back. The fight for women’s rights is a long historic struggle against a set of values that restricts the rights of, not only women, but LGBTQ people, trans people and people of colour. When I was young, I had the money to pay for an abortion. There’s a quote that I encountered when we were working on the Holocaust Project, that those who have the least to say about human events suffer the gravest of consequences. So it’s going to gravely affect women who do not have the resources to access abortion. It’s going to affect them horribly. You know, we have been living through the #MeToo movement. Well, there’s another kind of #MeToo movement, particularly in the US. It has to do with me too and what I ate. Me too and what I want. Too many young people get wrapped up in that kind of me too. So I guess for them, this is going to be a rude awakening. Are young people willing to stand up for their rights? Without that, we’re lost. When I heard the news that the supreme court was poised to overturn Roe V Wade I thought: no, fucking no. The supreme court does not represent the majority of Americans – who support abortion – and it has no moral authority to control women’s bodies. I have been getting emails all day and night from women around the world who are panicked, raging, saying this cannot happen in the US, for if it does, it will catalyse and amplify the rightwing misogynist project that is taking away the rights of women everywhere, having a devastating impact on their lives and now escalated during the pandemic. If we allow the erasure of this central right for women, it will escalate the erasure of them all. It is absurd for this country – with one of the highest maternal mortality rates and no paid maternity leave – to be forcing childbirth on women. And there is also no accountability for the people impregnating women – which is because this is not about babies, it is about destroying women’s agency and autonomy. And we know that this will most harshly affect the lives of Black and Brown women and marginalised people. That this ruling appears engineered by three Trump appointees to the court – Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas, two accused predators (both denied the allegations), together with avowed anti-abortionist Amy Coney Barrett, is no surprise. We are seeing the greatest pushback of rights I’ve experienced in my lifetime. Those of us who have fought to live in a world where women have choices and bodily independence know that the patriarchy is endlessly aggressive and brutal. If we are not radical, bold and vigilant, rights are destroyed. Young and old people – those who have never lived without Roe v Wade and those who have – need to join together now and rise up – this is our future. Forcing women to have a baby is a form of control and violence. This MUST be a wakeup call, the alarm where we take to the streets and stay in the streets until this patriarchal madness ends.V is the founder of V-Day, a global movement to end violence against all women, girls and the planet A part of me is like, this is a fucking disaster. But the other part of me knew this was going to happen. Ever since Trump was elected, we knew this was coming. The white supremacist Christian right has been working on this for nearly 50 years, and they’ve won. I had an illegal abortion in 1996 in Egypt and a legal abortion in the US in 2000. I can’t believe that my past is becoming the present in the United States. This is the most powerful country in the world, and this fundamental right for pregnant people is being stripped away. Those who can afford to get a safe abortion will continue to do so, and mostly Black, Indigenous and Brown people, and working-class people, will not. But that’s been the reality for many years now. Texas had already shrivelled the number of abortion clinics it had. Ever since I moved to the US from Egypt, I’d been saying that the United States is a theocracy, but no one is paying attention. The Christian right is more powerful in the US than the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt ever dreamed of being. But because they’re predominantly white and Christian, they’re considered to be less dangerous. As an Egyptian feminist, I have to call out the role of women in creating this theocracy. Look at supreme court associate justice Amy Coney Barrett. It is not just men taking away our abortion rights.The Seven Necessary Sins for Women and Girls is out now, published by Penguin Random House It’s a terrible blow. It was not unexpected, but there’s an element of sheer disbelief at the audacity of this move by the ultra right. Eighty per cent of the American public believes a woman has the right to do with her own body as she chooses, but it is still not respected. It affects everybody because it’s coming in under the privacy aspect of the constitution. This means that they are now going to be moving [in] on medical abortions, same-sex marriage, gay rights in general. I mean, it just takes your breath away. There’s an old phrase about Americans always doing the right thing, but at the very last moment. We do adapt but, God, we could die waiting. The hope is that this will galvanise us at the polls, not just in 2024, but this coming fall. The 80% of the country that thought rather sensibly that this was a done deal, that this was a woman’s right under the constitution, will be galvanised and we will have a very different outcome at the election. But it’s a hell of a scary time. There’s no time to despair. You do everything you can think of to change the situation. New legislation is already being introduced by Democrats in the house because the Republican party has totally gone down the tube. It’s Trump’s party now. There will be marching, demonstrations, sit-ins, petitions. Women will go ahead and disobey the law. What are they going to do when half the population is in revolt? Not 20%, not the ultra right wing, not the evangelicals. Women are going to control what happens to our own bodies. No matter how many thousands of us have to go to jail. We are not turning back the clock. No way.Robin Morgan is the editor of Sisterhood Is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings from the Women’s Liberation Movement Roe v Wade was a life-changing ruling, probably one of the most important – from the ground level – supreme court rulings there has ever been. It meant that women could stay in school. It meant women could work in a consistent way. It meant women could leave abusive partners. It meant that women didn’t have to marry the man who got them pregnant. I felt horrified when I found out it could be overturned. This really allows states to do whatever they want with abortion, and 26 states is a lot of people. This is going to affect women whether or not they have an abortion, because it says, basically, you’re here to procreate, and we don’t care if there are health concerns, or rape or incest. If a man can get you pregnant, you have to have that child. I think that’s a tremendous statement that women do not have that human right any more. One thing that is in our control is how much work, time and money we’re willing to spend on re-enshrining abortion rights and abortion access. I think there’s going to be a tremendous need for money to help women in places where abortion will now be unavailable – we have to work on getting abortion pills to those women. There is a very active network of abortion funds, which raise money for low-income women to pay for their abortion care. People don’t realise it’s not just the cost of the abortion. It’s also travel, childcare, lodging, food, being able to take time off work. It would be really great if people started giving significantly to abortion funds.Katha Pollitt is the author of Pro: Reclaiming Abortion Rights I started my abortion activism in the US in 2002. In 2010, 87% of US counties did not have an abortion provider. By 2017, it was closer to 90%. Most people in the US think Roe v Wade has protected abortion access, but it’s mostly protected abortion access for wealthy people, and women with the ability to travel large distances. So this news for those of us who’ve been in this work for years is horrifying and sickening and rage-inducing, but it is not surprising. It’s easy for people in the UK and Europe to think this is an American problem. But it’s not. Northern Ireland still does not have commissioned abortion services. In Europe last year, Poland enforced a near-total ban on abortion. Women there die of preventable causes because doctors won’t give them abortions. There’s no abortion in Malta and Andorra, and it’s highly restricted in Liechtenstein. And that’s not even considering the global south. It’s disheartening. But after the initial punch to the gut I will do my best to feel hopeful because maybe it will motivate people to make systemic change. That systemic change may be abortions being self-managed with pills, and grassroots networks of activists helping women and pregnant people exercise their right to obtain safe abortions.Mara Clarke is the founder of the Abortion Support Network Underpinning this judgment is, very clearly, not a fealty to the law. It’s not even a fealty to the idea that foetal life is particularly valuable. Instead, what underpins it is a deeply misogynistic worldview that seeks to restore traditional gender roles, male dominance over public, economic and political life, and female subservience and dependence. If women can’t control their own bodies, they can’t control their own futures. The justices are not stupid people. They know that. The judgment is going to open a huge can of worms. It will throw the entire country into chaos. It’s going to be a legislative circus. Abortion rights activists will frankly make sure that women have access to safe abortion, whether legal or not. In an already deeply polarised country that’s already experienced serious challenges to democratic norms and systems, this is another kick towards greater division, and a greater fraying of US democracy. All of the women I know are sad, and absolutely livid. One in four American women will have an abortion in her life. The women in my life have been talking about how different so many of our lives would have been if we didn’t have access to safe abortion. About all the career opportunities that would never have happened. The men we would never have married. All the novels that weren’t written, and the inventions never dreamed up. The wanted children that never come into the world. The big loves that women never find, and the abusive relationships they never leave. The stability that low-income women are never able to claw their way to. There is a tremendous amount that is foreclosed upon, when women can’t make these fundamental choices about their bodies. I was horrified when I heard the news, but not surprised; it was clear that a lot of the justices wanted to overturn Roe v Wade entirely. It’s worth pointing out that, for a lot of people, Roe hasn’t meant much in practice, because states that are hostile to abortion have already made it all but impossible to access abortion. Plenty of states already have burdensome laws that make abortion logistically or procedurally impossible, or really expensive. We’re not going to go back to the dark days of the coathanger abortion. What we’ll see is an acceleration in self-managed abortion using medication. Thankfully, self-managed abortion is much safer now with pills, not that that’s a replacement for safe and legal abortion. But it’s still a horrible decision that will endanger people. The supreme court likes to say it’s not political, which I find funny. This decision has been the result of the conservative legal movement packing the court with extreme anti-abortion conservatives for decades. It’s been their long-term strategic goal. There’s also talk of overturning same-sex marriage, and some rightwing politicians even want to look at the right to contraception. They will be coming for other laws. I don’t think this stops at abortion. It’s horrifying.Dr Sydney Calkin is a senior lecturer in human geography at Queen Mary University of London We have been expecting this for some time: despite what he said, it was clear that Brett Kavanaugh and the others were going to try to overturn Roe v Wade if they could. I was shocked, but not surprised. The American right wing is patient and methodical – it has been building power from the ground up and spreading its propaganda for a long time. We have already seen access to abortion in some states be so radically curtailed it is effectively nonexistent. If Roe v Wade is overturned, it will create a patchwork United States where rights in some states are very different to those in others. I do not have to worry about pregnancy at this point in my life, but I do see this as an attack on every person who is capable of becoming pregnant – an attempt to make women unequal, unfree and second-class citizens. Anti-abortion laws are based on lies and the pretence that those getting abortions are all reckless, hypersexual, irresponsible hussies – whereas the majority are, in fact, women who are already mothers. We must draw attention to the realities of abortion. The argument that it is easy to carry a child to term and then give it up for adoption is another anti-abortion lie – pregnancy itself is life-altering and it can be life-threatening. It can injure and incapacitate bodies, and it has an enormous emotional impact. There’s already a huge amount of fury among those who support access to abortion, and my great hope is that people can hang on to that fury long enough to produce the kind of blue wave that took back the house in 2018. We often talk about right-wing “backlashes”, but there are progressive backlashes, too.Rebecca Solnit is the author of numerous books, including The Mother of All Questions",News/US news,‘It’s a hell of a scary time’: leading US feminists on the threat to Roe v Wade,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/04/its-a-hell-of-a-scary-time-leading-us-feminists-on-the-threat-to-roe-v-wade

5/4/2022,"When Starbucks management came for Sean Andrews, it didn’t surprise him, exactly. Tensions were already running high in the Denver coffee shop where he worked. A few days prior, Andrews’ fellow baristas had walked off the job in a six-hour strike. They were demonstrating for their unionization effort and against what they saw as a sustained pattern of anti-labor tactics by Starbucks. Workers knew the strike was an escalation and expected retaliation. Even so, Andrews was unprepared when the Denver Starbucks district manager pulled him aside before a shift, forced him to turn off his phone and asked him to take a call. The woman on the other end would eventually identify herself as a “corporate investigator” who looks into losses in stores. After some innocuous questions about company policy, she began quizzing him about leftover food, according to a recording of the interaction obtained by the Guardian. Did his coworkers ever take any for themselves? Did he? After sticking to the company line at first, an audibly exasperated Andrews turned blunt. In the back of the store, there’s a box for leftover food that goes to a local food pantry. If a piece of food was about to turn bad, or if a store item was expired and set to be thrown away, he or his coworkers would at times grab something on their way out, “like every [barista] who works for Starbucks,” he said. Cost of living has ballooned in Denver in recent years, with housing prices growing by 21% in the past year alone. The starting hourly salary for baristas is $16.37, according to a job posting from March (experienced employees can make more than $21 an hour). One of Andrews’ coworkers was functionally homeless at the time, a fact that he shot back at the company investigator when she asked for the names of people who took food. (Several Starbucks employees interviewed for this story described regularly being behind on rent.) The investigator then asked if Andrews had a home. “Yes,” he replied, “no thanks to Starbucks.” At this point, the Starbucks investigator began grilling him, repeatedly demanding the identities of workers who took food, and demanding to know who was homeless. Andrews felt angry and uncomfortable. He refused to answer. “I know exactly why you’re doing this,” he said, referring to anti-union retaliation. Eventually, he stood up and announced that he quit. “I will let all the other [baristas] know that this is happening,” he said to the investigator and his district manager. The investigator told him that if he did not leave immediately, his manager would call the police. Andrews’ run-in with his bosses is a small part of an ongoing struggle between the world’s largest coffee chain and thousands of its American workers. For years, unions had considered Starbucks notoriously difficult to organize. In December, workers at a Starbucks in Buffalo, New York, voted to form a union, the first in the history of the iconic Seattle coffee chain. The victory broke the dam, and the subsequent flood has spread across the country. “I was amazed that they were able to pull it off,” said Trey Slopsema, a Denver barista and an early organizer at the Denver store. “And it really just stuck with me that this is something that we could actually do.” The union vote results for this Denver Starbucks will be announced on 10 May. This store is one of more than 200 locations with active union campaigns. More than 50 stores have successfully voted to unionize, including, in late April, one in the small town of Superior, Colorado, the first in the state. Taken along with the recent labor win at an Amazon warehouse – Amazon was another white whale for labor organizers – the Starbucks union push is part of a historic outpouring of worker activism in the US. But even in this context, the Denver union drive is notable. Buffalo, the site of the first Starbucks union win, has a strong labor culture and hundreds of local unions. By contrast, Colorado is a nominally liberal state that has trended Democratic in recent elections, but its union culture is noticeably weak. Colorado has a modified right-to-work law, which means that employees in unionized workplaces are not required to join the union. The state’s rate of unionized workers is several points below the national average. At a basic level, Denver residents are far less likely to know a union member, or have been exposed to labor organizations, than in some other parts of the country. Colorado labor historians and union leaders described a pro-business, libertarian-tinged political climate that adds an extra degree of difficulty to an already hard process. “If you go to Great Lakes cities, rust belt cities, there are old industries that still carry strong union identity,” said Nate Bernstein, health care director for United Food and Commercial Workers Local Number 7, which represents 23,000 grocery store and retail workers in Colorado and Wyoming. Denver’s economic makeup, he said, is not conducive to union density. On top of that, Bernstein identified a cultural resistance to unions that stems from Denver’s self-image as a “cowboy town”, where myths of rugged western individualism are dearly held. John Enyeart, a labor historian at Bucknell University, called this a common trope among western employers, one with little basis in historic fact. “The mountain men worked together,” he said. “It’s hard to fight off a bear on one’s own. The idea that they were doing this all individually is nonsense.” Corporations want you to think of the workplace as your family. For decades, American companies have often talked about their workplace in friendly terms. Workers are encouraged to trust their employer, to meld personal identity and professional occupation. Starbucks’ is part of this lineage. A press release on the company website from 2016 begins: “Colleagues at work can sometimes feel like family.” The company has long referred to all their employees, from high-level management down to baristas, as “partners”. In a video call leaked to the pro-labor news site More Perfect Union, Starbucks’ CEO, Howard Schultz, recently told company managers that “it’s an American right of workers not to unionize and to embrace the values and the culture of his or her company”. Appeals of this sort to a sympathetic company culture have not always been the norm. In Colorado, the state’s labor history recalls a time when the seesawing conflict between organized labor and corporate power was often confrontational – and sometimes violent. At the turn of the 20th century, the state’s unions were strong and well organized across industries. More conservative craft unionists would go on strike with workers in other industries. And in the mines, the unions were radical, powerful and ready to fight. At the time, Colorado’s economy relied on coal, gold and silver extracted from the Rocky Mountains. “If you wanted to do any kind of work in a mining town like Cripple Creek – bartender, musician, anything – you had to be a union member,” said Thomas Andrews, a historian of the Western United States at University of Colorado. He also noted that these mining towns were often racially exclusive, with animus toward Mexican Americans and Chinese and eastern European immigrants running high among the unions. In this period, large and aggressive mining strikes were the norm at least once per decade, as miners went on strike for better working conditions, while the companies retaliated in often brutal fashion. In 1913, the United Mine Workers of America called a general strike in Colorado’s coalfields, one that targeted the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company, the state’s largest miner and owned by John D Rockefeller Jr. To break the strike, the company hired private guards to harass the workers and their families, who had gathered in a tent encampment in the town of Ludlow. On 20 April, the private soldiers, along with troops from the Colorado national guard, attacked the camp, killing at least 21 people, including 11 children. A 10-day war followed. Well-organized militias of striking miners – including many veterans of older mining conflicts – fought a guerrilla campaign against the Colorado national guard and the mining corporations, killing more people than died at Ludlow. The Ludlow Massacre became a pivotal moment in early 20th century labor struggles. An investigation by Congress into mine safety conditions followed, and there was widespread outrage and the Rockefeller family. But labor’s reputation suffered as well. Colorado newspapers turned against the unions, and business interests believed that the state’s reputation needed to be restored. After the second world war, Colorado’s economic path largely tracked that of the rest of the sun belt: huge investments of federal funds into the national highway system, technology and military infrastructure brought lifestyle-oriented, upper-class professionals to the state in droves. This economy endures today, with aerospace, telecommunications, financial services and tech driving the booming economy on Colorado’s Front Range. None of these industries have strong union membership. This thin labor culture meant that some Denver Starbucks employees were unfamiliar with unions when the store’s employees began organizing. Kelly Morris took a job at Starbucks six years ago to supplement her income as a preschool teacher, which did not cover groceries and rent. In that time, she had never considered the need for a union. Morris was born in Golden, a Denver suburb. Growing up, she didn’t know any union members or have any personal connection to labor. She was not against unions, more that they weren’t a part of her life. So when her coworkers began to discuss unionizing, Morris was hesitant. She didn’t want to be fired and lose the healthcare she desperately needed. She wrestled with the idea for some weeks. But talking to her coworkers eventually convinced her. Morris signed a union card, as well as the initial letter to management announcing the staff’s intention to unionize. Putting her name out there still makes her nervous, but Morris ultimately feels proud to stand with her coworkers. “We need to have a say,” she told me. “A union would give us that.” Enyeart, the Bucknell historian, drew a connection between the mine wars of the past and the struggles of Starbucks baristas today. “[Starbucks workers] are being intimidated and their livelihoods are being destroyed,” he said. Back then, Rockefeller knew he was never going to jail for violating labor laws that were on the books. The Starbucks people are doing the same thing. They know that, worst-case scenario, they have to pay some fines.” The Starbucks store where Andrews worked is on Colfax Avenue – the longest continuous commercial street in America. It offers a procession of taco counters, electronics stores, laundromats and several of Denver’s famous theaters and music venues. The Starbucks store sits between an apartment complex and an addiction treatment center. It looks like a barn, and that’s what locals call it. In the Denver Starbucks community, the Barn has something of a reputation. The pace is fast, with no space for inexperienced baristas. It’s also notorious for being understaffed, and the clientele includes a fair share of unhoused people. These factors, according to multiple interviews with store baristas, make it so workers from suburban Denver locations virtually never pick up shifts at the store. “‘Oh God, you work at the Barn,’ that’s not an uncommon thing to hear,” said Slopsema. But the store’s isolation creates a distinctly close-knit team, he went on. When he turned 18, Slopsema wanted to travel around the country and used Starbucks to fund his wandering. He worked at stores in Indiana and Florida before moving to Colorado to see the mountains. The camaraderie at the Barn stands out. “That’s why I stick around. I’ve never worked with a team that’s been so close.” This cohesion helped the store’s team weather the pandemic. Many employees have been sick at various points in the past two years. Customers were often belligerent in response to mask mandates. Some were even violent. Last fall, Andrews was punched in the face so hard by an angry customer that his tooth chipped. Another employee, Michaela Sallero, was pepper-sprayed in the face at the drive-thru window by a man upset that the store was out of mocha Frappuccinos. For a month after the incident, baristas would find shattered glass bottles littering the outside of their store in the morning. The man was throwing full Frappuccino bottles at the store in the night. According to Sallero, Starbucks management was of little help. The bosses refused to allow workers to hang a picture of the man in the store, so baristas shared it among themselves. Sallero noted that management did offer her a trauma counseling session in the back of the store. Overall, she said, “I don’t think they took it very seriously.” So when news of Buffalo’s union win broke, employees at the Barn were immediately excited. Talk of the union benefits proposed in Buffalo consumed the group chat – better pay, workplace protections, a policy where, if the store is short-staffed, the other employees absorb the missing employees pay for that shift rather than the company – as well as basic discussion of what unions are. The horizon of possibilities for their workplace had just expanded. After the Barn announced its union drive in January, high-ranking Denver Starbucks figures began to appear in the store, observing the baristas and nitpicking tiny infractions, like not wearing a name tag. According to several baristas, the store is chronically out of name tags, and refill requests often go ignored. Every barista sat through a one-on-one meeting with management over the course of three days in February. They were asked what they knew about the union and how they intended to vote. Companies cannot legally tell workers that they will lose benefits because of labor organizing. Instead, according to more than a half dozen Starbucks employees, managers made vague insinuations, stating that they could not promise that benefits would not get worse. “If we have a union, we’ll be doing the bargaining,” Sellaro said. “Why would we argue for worse benefits?” There’s a reason Sellaro’s bosses honed in on benefit loss. Benefits are why many workers seek out Starbucks in the first place – and part of what has made organizing the company historically difficult. Starbucks was the first large US corporation to offer healthcare benefits to part-time workers. Several workers at the Barn mentioned this as an incentive to stick with Starbucks. Most of them are in their 20s and 30s. Some have other service industry gigs. For many others, Starbucks is their only job. The company’s college tuition aid program is “the only reason” why Vanessa Castro has stuck with Starbucks for four years and three different stores, including a move to Portland and then back to her home state of Colorado. Her getting a communications degree from Arizona State University would not be possible otherwise, she told me in an interview at a park down the street from the Barn. “If you start to empower employees by giving them benefits, options, resources to get success, you don’t get to choose when to stop,” she said. The next step, for Castro, is a union. Shortly after the first union win in Buffalo, Schultz, Starbucks’ well-known CEO, came out of retirement to lead the company again. The timing appears to be no accident. Schultz has a long history of opposing unions. In recent months, as the nationwide unionization campaign has gained momentum, Starbucks has deluged employees with anti-union messaging, fired pro-union workers, and spent millions of dollars on a law firm famous for union-busting. It’s unclear whether his advocacy is going well. At a recent event, Schultz promised workers that Starbucks would soon be getting into NFTs. In November, he made a shocking comparison between the company’s benefit program and Jewish concentration camp prisoners sharing blankets during the Holocaust. At the same time, Schultz has argued that Starbucks can treat its employees well voluntarily, just without the presence of a union. Now he plans to do just that – and pit unionized workers against non-unionized ones. On May 3, Starbucks announced immediate nationwide pay increases, with better sick time benefits and, for the first time, the option for customers to tip with their credit cards coming this fall. But in the fine print of the announcement, the company stated that the entire benefit expansion would apply to non-unionized stores only. On Twitter, the Starbucks Workers United union account claimed that pressure from the union campaign led to the raises. The union also stated that it has “filed charges against Howard Schultz’s threats that union stores won’t receive these benefits.” At the Barn, loss of benefits became a concern in February and March, as workers who once had no trouble getting shifts found their hours abruptly cut – a strategy, most believed, meant to demoralize them or force them to quit so new employees could be hired and potentially change the union vote. Some of them relied on Starbucks for all of their income. Requests for more shifts went unheeded. Yet several shift supervisors – a role reserved for experienced baristas – describe being left with skeleton crews during busy times. Lillian Sanders, a shift supervisor who has worked in five Starbucks stores in three states over almost four years, called the tactics “retaliatory” and “purposefully isolating”. “I’ve never had to work so hard to get my manager to answer her phone,” she said. Then there were the write-ups. In mid-February, Slopsema, a barista at the Barn, was given a final warning – the last step before being fired. The reason given was that the store safe was found unlocked after one of his shifts, as well as a failure to lock the store. According to Slopsema, the safe’s latch was broken, an issue he raised with his bosses weeks before the incident. In a recording of a conversation about the warning obtained by the Guardian, Slopsema can be heard expressing shock at the severity of the punishment. “I’ve never received a written warning before,” he said in the recording, “so it’s kind of upsetting to see that it’s just a final right off the bat after working here for four years. He takes responsibility for leaving the store unlocked – he blames it on a mental lapse – but pushes back regarding the safe. “I’ve also showed that the safe itself needs to be worked on,” he can be heard saying to his manager. “It doesn’t shut properly. Unless you really press onto it, it will just open back up, but I’ve already connected with you on that.” Two weeks later, Sellaro received her own final warning after she left her keys in her apron, hanging in the back, locked in the store overnight. Sellaro thought so little of her oversight with the keys that she subsequently mentioned it to her boss. Nothing happened for more than two weeks, at which point she was informed that she was one step from being terminated. Below a final warning are two less severe disciplinary levels. Both she and Slopsema had worked at Starbucks for years and never been written up for any infraction (Andrews now suspects that his encounter with the company investigator would have led to a final warning had he not quit on the spot). Both were known to be leading union advocates. Sellaro called it intimidation. “If it was so egregious, why didn’t you say something to me sooner?” she said. After baristas at the Barn went on strike in early March, messages from the company became more direct. “Please vote and vote NO,” read a letter distributed to employees. Another letter from around that time accused the workers and their supporters of physically intimidating and yelling obscenities at customers during the walkout and strike. The letter urged employees to vote against the union. It was signed by Andrea Streedain, Starbucks’ regional vice-president for the mountain west. In an internal company video call for store managers that recently leaked, Denver district manager Kaylin Driscoll can be seen tearfully recounting these allegations against the striking workers. “We watched everything we know about Starbucks and our culture erode,” she said. (Driscoll was the manager in the room when Andrews was questioned by the investigator. The Guardian called and left voicemails requesting comment with both Driscoll and Streedain. The company did not respond to a list of questions by press time). Multiple workers who participated in the strike called allegations of physical intimidation a lie, though they acknowledge booing cars that broke the picket line to use the drive through. “We behaved as if we were on the clock,” Sellaro said. Several recalled irate customers screaming at the demonstrators. Someone threw an egg at them from a nearby building. In the staff group chat, one worker described the letter as “pure propaganda”. On 20 April, Starbucks’ lawyers filed a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) against Starbucks Workers United (SBWU is an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union, which represents millions of workers across multiple sectors), one that specifically cites the March walkout at the Barn. It mentions the alleged yelling at customers and physical intimidation, according to CNBC. With less than a week before the results of the vote are announced, there has been serious attrition among the Barn’s leading union voices. Andrews had quit after his encounter with the Starbucks investigator. Sanders gave her two weeks notice in early April, along with two other baristas. She described feeling “forced out” by a difficult and intentionally unhelpful management. And Slopsema was finally terminated. (He declined to discuss the details of his dismissal, but several coworkers described the firing as not justified.) At least four Unfair Labor Practice complaints had been filed to the NLRB on behalf of employees at the Barn, to go with dozens from other locations around the US, alleging anti-union activities of many kinds. Despite – and perhaps in response to – this pressure campaign, several workers said they are confident in the results of the vote. Corporate higher-ups continue to make regular appearances in the store. Sellaro said that the short-staffing persists. At least eight employees have quit or been fired in recent months, several in response to Slopsema’s dismissal. The store has been forced to close early several times, angering some customers. “We’re consistently being staffed as thinly as humanly possible,” Sellaro said in a late April phone interview. She suspects the goal is to create resentment among the staff, but said the tactic has backfired. “The way we’ve been abandoned by leadership, the way they leave us to flounder, and don’t seem to understand how exhausting that is – [coworkers] keep saying that they are excited to have their own voice.” I spoke to Sellaro by phone on the day she mailed in her ballot. It was a proud moment, almost three months to the day when she and her coworkers publicly announced their intent to unionize. But the recent months have tainted her relationship to Starbucks, her main source of income. She feels scrutinized, like her bosses are looking for a chance to fire her. She has had panic attacks before some shifts. Longtime work friends have quit or been fired. She can’t help feeling sad for her coworkers who began organizing with her, but will not be there at the end. “We slogged through the, excuse my language, extremely shitty moments together, and now we’re getting those little joyous moments,” she said. “I can’t imagine how hard it is for Trey [Slopsema] and Sean [Andrews] and Lillian [Sanders] and everyone else to see us celebrating and not be able to fully share in it. Bittersweet is the only way to describe it.”",News/Business,‘Pure propaganda’: inside Starbucks’ anti-union tactics,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/04/starbucks-anti-union-tactics
5/4/2022,"‘You heard me, yeah?” That’s Robin Hood, back in Nottingham after three years away on the Crusades, trying to persuade Maid Marian to finally marry him. Sticklers for 12th-century accuracy look away now. Bill Thomas’s historical clunker takes its cue from the Guy Ritchie approach to ye olde times authenticity, but without the studio budget to pull off the action scenes. This is the legend of Robin Hood told from the perspective of Maid Marian, with bit of female kick-assery standing in for feminism. It opens with Marian (Sophie Craig) hiding out in a convent while Robin is off fighting. Pretending to be a novitiate called Sister Matilda, she is dying of boredom. Her one hobby is sneaking out past the mother superior to poach deer for starving peasants (and lamping soldiers who get in her way). Robin returns to Sherwood after the death of the king. After a half-hearted snog, the pair go on the run from the Sheriff of Nottingham (Bob Cryer), who is also back, miffed at being in exile for the past three years. Unfathomably, Dominic Andersen plays Robin Hood with bland boybandishness despite having the back catalogue of Hollywood’s finest to model his performance on, from Errol Flynn to Russell Crowe. There are one or two nice double-crosses along the way, but The Adventures of Maid Marion falls pretty flat, the fault perhaps of resources stretched too thin. The script throws in the odd “begone!” but is almost comically unmedieval– there’s even a blasphemous nun: “Jesus, Matilda!” And pity the poor unprotected peasants of Nottingham: they barely get a look in.  The Adventures of Maid Marian is available on 9 May on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,The Adventures of Maid Marian review – historical clunker with a boyband Robin Hood,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/04/the-adventures-of-maid-marian-review-historical-clunker-with-a-boyband-robin-hood
5/4/2022,"If your brain were copied and placed in a robot body, would it have human rights? That’s the thorny issue at the heart of Citizen Sleeper, a game set on a run-down space station called Erlin’s Eye in the far-flung future. In this reality, AI is strictly controlled and artificial beings that achieve sentience are hunted down and destroyed, Blade Runner-style. But “emulated” humans known as sleepers offer a loophole, being neither fully artificial nor fully human. Nefarious megacorporations will pay desperate volunteers handsomely for the right to emulate their brain. The person’s memories are then excised before their cloned mind is pitched into a robot body and worked remorselessly. Sleepers are a classless entity owned by a corporation, who have no idea of who they once were yet retain human feelings. The game casts you as a sleeper who has just escaped from a life of company slavery. You arrive on Erlin’s Eye as a stowaway and must struggle to survive. Finding food is a daily necessity: despite their artificial bodies, sleepers still need to eat. More problematic is your body’s built-in obsolescence. Unless you receive regular doses of a proprietary serum, your robot body will decay – an insurance policy from your maker, Essen-Arp, to ensure that no one else can profit from company property. Worst of all, Essen-Arp wants its sleeper back and is tracking your every move. Each day, or “cycle”, you are given five dice, which you can assign to tasks around the station, such as unloading cargo from a space freighter or helping out at a space bar. Each job has a positive, neutral or negative outcome, and the higher the number on the die the greater the chance you’ll succeed. But there’s never enough time, and never enough dice. Each day your body will degrade further, and you’re constantly forced to choose between earning money to pay for food and serum, or exploring more of the station to find new opportunities and advance the plot. As your body degrades, the number of dice you receive at the start of each cycle is reduced, piling on the pressure. As with designer Gareth Damian Martin’s previous game, In Other Waters, you mostly interact with the world through descriptions of the things around you, rather than graphical depictions. But here the text is supplemented with some lovely character art by Guillaume Singelin, and the writing is gloriously evocative and compelling. In a sense, there’s nothing new here: the central idea of human brains in artificial bodies has been explored extensively in other sci-fi works. But although Martin draws liberally on many well-worn sci-fi staples, including gruff mercenaries and evil space corporations, he pastes together a convincing portrait of life aboard a creaking space station that feels intriguing and unique. Clues about the history of Erlin’s Eye and the characters aboard it are steadily drip-fed, and I was compelled to see how the twisting conspiracies and tragic character arcs are resolved. Yet the tension inherent in the first half of the game is largely removed by the end, as you gradually find solutions to your synthetic body’s various problems. The finale is more of a sedate plod to the exit than a frantic dash to the finish line, as you saunter around the station tying up loose threads at your leisure. You can easily reach one of the game’s multiple endings within a day or two – although you may want to dive back in for a second playthrough to see how different choices would have affected your journey. The characters are so well drawn, literally and figuratively, that it’s tempting to spend as much time as you can in their orbit. It helps, too, that the music is superb, vaguely reminiscent of Blade Runner’s Vangelis soundtrack at times, and it changes subtly with the decisions that you make. It’s just a shame that Citizen Sleeper fizzles out at the point where it’s set to explode. There are far more stories to tell in this fascinating universe, and this is some of the finest video-game sci-fi writing out there.

5/4/2022,"Daisy Hildyard’s first novel, Hunters in the Snow, was lyrical and haunting and brought well-deserved critical success. She followed it with a book of essays on climate change and human relations with plants and animals, The Second Body. In Emergency, Hildyard develops the strengths of her first novel and the concerns of her nonfiction. There isn’t exactly a plot but there are spiralling, intricate meditations on plants, animals, humans and ecosystems, gracefully told through an approximate coming-of-age story set in a village in a nondescript part of northern England. Emergency begins with the narrator “old enough to be outside and alone”, sitting above a quarry, watching a kestrel and a vole who have not yet seen each other: “We all waited to find out who would move first.” This incident leads to the memory of playing with the children next door; then to a pet rabbit that ate its young (“Even today, she seems to me very human in the way her principles forced her to self-destruct”). We move on to an uneasy relationship with an eccentric elderly neighbour; then back to that moment in the quarry, which produces “gravel that was sent all over the world, the requirements of Norwegian motorways and new cities in China determined the shape of the quarry and the size of the shape it left”. The narrative touches on a neighbour’s work in the local abattoir; watching foxes in the garden at night; the arrival of the first computer in the village primary school, where one of the teachers usually carries bruises and fractures from her husband’s assaults. We explore the unnamed narrator’s world, which does not extend beyond her own village but also, of course, sits within global networks like everywhere else. The tabs from her cans of Fanta are found later in the stomachs of dead birds; at school the children learn about the Chernobyl rains; the animals she knows are milked, slaughtered and sent away. Family life is stable enough, although both parents work in precarious jobs and money is tight. Some of the village’s free-range children torture animals, corporal punishment is informally tolerated at school and there is ample opportunity to learn about pain and violence within and between species of all sorts. The villagers casually accept racism and snobbery all the time. If this is a pastoral novel, it follows Fiona Mozley’s Elmet and Max Porter’s Lanny in its convincing insistence on the gothic darkness of modern country life as well as the beauty of the English countryside. Sometimes, a present-day voice cuts across the recollections. We discover suddenly that the narrator speaks from her London flat during the first lockdown. As a child, her half-sister Serena brings her a book of pictures of cave paintings, one of few moments when someone enters the story from beyond the village: “Serena explained that most of the mammals in the pictures had been hunted out of existence.” The next paragraph begins: “That book is one of the few things I still own from that time … It’s April and I’m not allowed to leave the house more than once a day … the authorities say that the world is fatally interconnected and inside, alone with my thoughts, is the safest place to be.” And then, “in the morning”, we’re back with Serena, catching the school bus. There are more swoops across time, sudden interjections from a present-day adult speaker, one who remembers lapwings repeatedly rebuilding nests in the wheel-marks left by tractors and reflects that “I know what it’s like to keep on waiting for a baby that will never arrive”. This speaker’s smoke alarm beeps for weeks, until she stops hearing it; her recollection of a childhood neighbour’s vegetable garden is interrupted by the observation: “People say that growing plants is a calming thing to do but in my experience it is more often enraging.” For all its slowness and delicacy, this novel is a high-wire act, chancing the reader’s suspension of disbelief and commitment to a story that is manifestly moving only towards the familiar mess of the present day. As emergencies go, it’s gradual and plotless and thus almost more realistic than the form of the novel can bear. This book succeeds because of the chilly and beautifully sustained voice of its narrator, the precise embroidery of its sentences and paragraphs, its observations of the natural world and insistence that there is no distinction between humans and environments.

5/4/2022,"Victorian police officers received free tickets to boxing events with complimentary food and alcohol after alleged underworld figure Mick Gatto gifted the tickets to a senior detective, an anti-corruption commission hearing has heard. Det Sgt Wayne Dean confirmed in his evidence before a public Independent Broad-based Anti-Corruption (Ibac) hearing on Wednesday that on two occasions Gatto, who he had known since the mid-1990s, provided him free tickets to boxing events in Melbourne. Dean, who is subject to a wide-ranging corruption investigation, said that Gatto provided him four tickets to a fight between Anthony Mundine and Charles Hatley at the Melbourne Convention Centre in 2015. He was not aware of the value of the tickets, but they included food and drinks served at the table. Dean gave two of those tickets to a detective senior constable, who attended with his son. The officer was not named during the hearing. On the second occasion, in December last year, Dean said Gatto provided him with a fully-catered table of 10 to a fight night at the Melbourne Pavilion. When he received the tickets, Dean noticed they were valued at $440 each, he said, making the total gift worth $4,400. Two other officers attended the second event, Dean said. They were also not named. On both occasions, Dean said that he had not told the officers who had provided the tickets, but Gatto had visited them at their tables and spoken to them briefly. “No one knew where [the tickets] came from … although in saying that, that fight was being promoted by Mr Gatto himself,” Dean said. “I don’t know if it was obvious to them, but they probably would have known.” Dean said he now knew “with 100% certainty that I should have number one declared it and number two shouldn’t have went” to the boxing events. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In February, only days before Dean was subject to raids and a private examination by Ibac, Gatto again texted him offering a table of 10 to a boxing event in March, but Dean responded that he could not attend because he would be at a wedding. Dean earlier told the hearing that he believed he had been formally spoken to on three separate occasions by officers from the force’s professional standards or organised crime units because of his association with Gatto. Dean said that early in his career, he would speak with Gatto perhaps once a week at a restaurant on Lygon Street.

He had also attended a funeral and wedding with Gatto, visited him at Gatto’s Melbourne apartment, and had regularly been sent Christmas cards by him, the 37-year veteran of the force told the hearing. Dean gave evidence as a crown witness in Gatto’s trial for the 2004 murder of Andrew “Benji” Veniamin. Gatto was acquitted on the grounds of self-defence, and counsel assisting the coroner, Catherine Boston, said Dean’s evidence had been favourable to Gatto. Boston said that Dean told the jury the restaurant where the shooting occurred was regularly frequented by police, and was therefore not the sort of place that someone would decide to carry out a murder, and that he had not known Gatto to have had access to a gun in the restaurant. Dean said he understood how the evidence may have helped Gatto, but it was also the truth. Dean was later sanctioned by the force, he said, for having a conversation in the court with Gatto in the absence of the judge or jury, in which he said words to the effect of “gee you’ve lost some weight Mick”, and Gatto responded “gee you’ve put some on Wayne”. Ibac started to investigate Dean after a migration agent complained to the Australian Border Force that she had paid him and another man, Basilios (Bill) Meletsis, to settle a financial dispute, but that they had not succeeded in having her money returned. Dean is alleged to have used his position as a police officer and police resources to complete multiple jobs on behalf of Meletsis in return for cash payments. He has admitted doing jobs for Meletsis, and that he received cash payments from him, but that they were not necessarily for the jobs. Meletsis has denied making any payments to Dean.

5/4/2022,"The art world is mourning the loss of one of Australia’s most respected First Nations artists, Mr Wanambi, with one of his mentees saying “his passing has changed our entire landscape”. The Yolngu painter, film-maker and curator died in Darwin on Sunday, more than 1,000km from his home in north-eastern Arnhem Land. He was just 59 years old. His family have requested his first name and image not be published. Best known for his saltwater bark designs and larrakitj (memorial poles), Wanambi has been represented in dozens of major exhibitions across Australia since gaining the authority to continue the art making practices of his father in 1997. Wanambi was also a key founder of the Mulka Project, a network of multimedia artists and video and sound technicians who use new technology as a means of sustaining, archiving and sharing Yolngu cultural knowledge. The group is based in Yirrkala, where Wanambi and his family live. Wanambi and Yirrkala’s Buku-Larrnggay Mulka Art Centre have also been pioneers in the NFT Indigenous art market. Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Fellow Yolngu artist Ishmael Marika, the Mulka Project’s creative director, has worked alongside Wanambi for the past 12 years. He told Guardian Australia the multi-award-winning artist had been a seminal influence in his own achievements, including a 2016 NATSIAA award for his film piece Sunlight Energy II and his digital video My Grandfather Passing on a Message, which was acquired by the National Gallery of Victoria. Marika spent several years visiting museums and galleries across Australia with Wanambi, collecting thousands of archival photographs and film footage for the Mulka Project. “He was our cultural adviser, he was always the one that would talk to the families, and make sure that we did not get into trouble,” he said. Will Stubbs, the coordinator of the Buku-Larrnggay Mulka Art Centre and a close friend of the artist for more than 30 years, said Wanambi had been experiencing major health issues, but his death was sudden and unexpected. “His spirit has quite a journey to go on now,” he said. “It’s hard to imagine the intensity of grief in his large family and the community.” Wanambi has had two solo exhibitions in galleries in Victoria over the past 11 years and another at Singapore’s Redot Gallery in 2016. His work is in permanent collections across the world, including France’s Musee de Lyon, Germany’s Museum Fünf Kontinente and Museum Kunstwerk, Switzerland’s Fondation Opale, the National Gallery of Australia, Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art and the Holmes a Court Collection. Recently he curated the first major survey of Aboriginal bark paintings ever staged outside Australia, Maḏayin, which is currently touring the US. In 2007 Wanambi became director of the Mulka Project, coordinating ventures such as Nhama, a collection of short films from Yirrkala, and serving as a mentor and trainer to younger Yolngu people. Mulka’s program and technical director, Joseph Brady, said he had been mentored by Wanambi for the past 10 years. “He adopted me as his brother on my first morning when I arrived here [at The Mulka Project] and we’ve worked side by side ever since,” Brady told Guardian Australia. “He was a visionary in many ways. He pushed the boundaries of what was possible with his artwork and with his clan design. He made inroads into the digital art world that nobody else was even considering doing. “There is no replacement for him. His passing has changed our entire landscape.” Stubbs said in addition to Wanambi’s extensive body of work, he would be remembered as a kind, gentle and humble man, a highly respected leader of the community, and an artist who had no qualms in using his talent as a tool to further the rights of Indigenous peoples. His involvement in the Saltwater Collection, now housed at the Australian National Maritime Museum, recognised the victory of the historic 2008 high court Blue Mud Bay decision, which secured Indigenous sea rights in the Northern Territory. The artist’s Wukiḏi installation, which sits in the foyer of the NT supreme court, commemorates the suspected police murder of Wanambi’s ancestor Dhakiyarr Wirrpanda, the first Indigenous person to have his case heard in the high court. “As an Indigenous person living a ceremonial life that faces many obstacles, it was a constant challenge to maintain spiritual health. But he would confront these challenges with kindness and compassion,” Stubbs said. “In the 30 years I have known him, I have never seen him display any anger, despite provocation that came his way.” Brady said Wanambi’s death has changed the north-eastern Arnhem Land community irrevocably. “It’s never going to be the same again,” he said. “We will move on, we will evolve. But it’s a totally new landscape that we’ll be working with.” Wanambi is survived by his wife, Warraynga, who is also an artist, their five children and multiple grandchildren.",Arts/Culture,‘A visionary in many ways’: art world mourns loss of Yolngu artist Mr Wanambi,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/04/a-visionary-in-many-ways-art-world-mourns-loss-of-yolngu-artist-mr-wanambi
