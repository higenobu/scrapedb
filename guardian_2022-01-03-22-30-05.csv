1/3/2022,"There are tiny but telling hints of what happened in the Keyham area of Plymouth on 12 August last year. A stretch of freshly-laid pavement at the corner where Jake Davison turned his pump action shotgun on himself after killing five people. A pile of compost in a community garden, created from the thousands of flowers left for the victims and set aside to be used when memorial trees or flower beds are planted. The new bench in the park installed in memory of two victims. “Everywhere you look there are awful memories,” said Hazel Lynch, a member of the Keyham neighbourhood watch, one of the groups leading the recovery from that evening in late summer when Davison, a 22-year-old apprentice crane operator who harboured extreme misogynistic views, carried out his 12-minute attack.  Lynch pointed out, for example, the area where the air ambulance had landed as children raced for safety and the spot where one boy sat for three whole days afterwards, trying to process what happened. “He wanted to be there and to try to understand what had happened. People are still doing that.” The attack hit not just the relatives and friends of those affected but the whole community. Three hundred people, many of them children, directly witnessed Davison’s attack or the immediate aftermath. Children still struggle to sleep, worried the “bad man” will get them, while some elderly people are too frightened to leave their homes. Many hundreds of personal alarms have been handed out to girls and women and Lynch said she now carries one for the first time in her life. “I wouldn’t go to the park by myself after dark now,” she said. The city had scarcely caught its breath after Davison’s attack, which began with him killing his mother, Maxine, when a few miles away 18-year-old Bobbi-Anne McLeod vanished from a bus stop in the Leigham area of the city in November. Her body was found near a beach three days later, a second disturbing crime with a woman at its centre. Much soul-searching has been prompted in Plymouth with the launch of a commission in the city to examine violence against women and girls. While crime figures overall are down in Devon and Cornwall, sexual attacks have risen. Stalking and harassment is up by 24% on 2019, rape by 18% and other sexual offences by 13.5%. Since September there have been more than 200 referrals to an app that allows people to highlight areas in Plymouth where they do not feel safe. Millions of pounds is being spent to try to help make the city safer for girls and women through initiatives such as setting up new CCTV cameras, boosting the number of taxi drivers after a post-Brexit drop and introducing initiatives such as bystander training to help people know how to challenge bad behaviour. Alison Hernandez, the police and crime commissioner for Devon, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, said a lot of work was being done but admitted girls and women were too often victims – and did not feel safe. “Although we have one of the safest force areas in the country, violent crime is rising. Bobbi-Anne’s death reminds us that policing must be relentlessly focused on making our communities safer, but we need to engage schools, local government and our public in that effort.” She believes society needs to look deeply at problems ranging from the accessibility to young people of violent pornography to domestic abuse. “This is a problem that cannot be resolved by police officers alone,” she said. Lyn Gooding, the chief executive of the charity First Light, which works with victims of domestic abuse and sexual violence, agrees. She told a Q&A organised by the new commission that work needed to be done in primary schools to help youngsters understand what a healthy relationship looked like. “We need to have difficult conversations with our young sons.” For Keyham specifically, the Home Office has provided more than £800,000 to pay for additional crime prevention measures and additional policing and almost as much again has been made available in the area to pay for extra children’s social care workers and educational psychologists to work in schools. So many Keyham people have a sad story to tell. Olivia, 15, who lives close to the spot where Davison killed himself, said she still thought often about his body slumped on the pavement. “It is still very difficult for a lot of people here,” she said. Rosemary, whose teenage son witnessed one of the shootings, said she feared his mental health had been compromised. “He is very confused, he finds it hard to understand what happened.” The Labour MP for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, Luke Pollard, who lives half a mile from the scene, warned that tragedies could lead to long-running social problems such as children struggling at school, rising crime rates, more people suffering from depression. “A whole community, a whole city can be traumatised.” He said people were beginning to ask more questions about the gun laws and in the new year a “Keyham manifesto” setting out what the area would like to be changed is due to produced. Heather Welch, the acting operations manager for Victim Support in Devon, said the shock waves would be felt for many years. It has called for the experiences of survivors of the Manchester Arena attack and the Grenfell fire to learn how to help people in Keyham. “People have had to make sense of the world in a different way.” The politicians and experts are keen to flag up the great work being done by people like Hazel Lynch, who is leading the transformation of a rickety old shed on the sports field where the shootings vigil took place into a community cafe and the neighbourhood watch chairman, Kevin Sproston, who lives by the motto: “Let’s make Keyham as good as the people.” He is still dashing around organising the Safer Keyham programme, which includes providing new security measures, such as better locks and peepholes, to try to make vulnerable people feel safer in their homes. Richard Baron, the managing director of a double glazing company, said he and his team had improved the security at 150 homes, providing the materials at cost. “If we can help make people a bit safer then we’re very happy to do that,” he said. “It will take a long time for this community to heal.”",News/UK news,‘I wouldn’t go to the park on my own now’: Plymouth traumatised by killings,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/03/i-wouldnt-go-to-the-park-on-my-own-now-plymouth-traumatised-by-killings
1/3/2022,"This outrageously good supper came about one afternoon when I was craving the anchovy and parmesan dressing of a classic caesar salad. But it was cold outside and I needed more substance on the plate, so, instead of the crisp lettuce, in came wedges of chargrilled hispi cabbage, all sweet and smoky, which I laid on garlic-rubbed toasts; both were perfect for mopping up that insane dressing. I have made this dish several times since and have loved it every time – I sincerely hope you do, too.  The sprightly, refreshing parsley salad is inspired by the famously good one at St John in London, and balances the almost meaty-tasting cabbage beautifully. Prep 30 minCook 15 minServes 4 2 hispi cabbage, cut through the stem into 4-6 wedges5-6 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to drizzleSalt and black pepper2 garlic cloves, peeled6 anchovies1 tsp dijon mustard1 tbsp white-wine vinegar4 tbsp buttermilk4 tbsp grated parmesan, plus extra, to serve4 pieces sourdough toast, to serve For the salad1 banana shallot, peeled and finely sliced2 big handfuls parsley leaves2 tbsp capersJuice of ½ lemon Heat a griddle pan or heavy frying pan. Rub the hispi wedges all over with one or two tablespoons of oil, season lightly and grill for six to nine minutes on one cut side. Turn and repeat on the other cut side of each wedge. Meanwhile, put a garlic clove and the anchovies in a mortar (or small food processor) with a scrunch of sea salt, and grind to a paste. Whisk in the mustard, vinegar and buttermilk, followed by the remaining four tablespoons of oil in a slow, steady stream, to make an emulsion. Stir in the grated parmesan and season to taste. Put the shallot, parsley and capers in a medium bowl, squeeze over the lemon and season lightly. When you are ready to eat, cut the remaining garlic clove in half and rub the cut sides over each piece of hot toast. Put a piece of toast on each of four plates, drizzle with good olive oil, then lay the warm hispi wedges on top. Spoon over the dressing, allowing it to fall into all the nooks and crannies, then grate over a little extra parmesan. Serve with a generous handful of the parsley and shallot salad on the side. You can leave out the anchovies and still create a delicious sauce with the addition of a little extra garlic, a splash of Henderson’s relish (the veggie version of Worcestershire sauce) and, if you like, a spoonful of white miso.

1/3/2022,"When Mary moved from Bedfordshire in the UK to Michigan in the US on a Fulbright scholarship in 1985, she wasn’t expecting to find love. Her mind was focused on the nutrition course she had enrolled on and her plans for a future career. In the spring of 1986, she was cycling home from a meeting with her tutor when she approached a fence covered in ivy. Roy, who had been pushing his bike, emerged from behind the fence before she had the chance to stop. “I hit his wheel and, because my hands were cold and I was wearing a backpack, I went sailing over the handlebars,” she remembers. “I landed on my chin and broke my jaw on the concrete.” In typical British fashion, she told him she was “absolutely fine”, but Roy says it was clear she was badly hurt. “My apartment was pretty close by so I got my roommate to drive her to the university health centre,” he says. The next day, Mary had to have her jaw wired shut, meaning she couldn’t eat solid food for three months. “Roy came to my apartment with some juice to suck through a straw. He said that when my jaw was unwired he would make me dinner,” she recalls. Although it was an accident, Roy felt “terrible” about what happened. “I was really concerned about her,” he says.  Over the summer they went their separate ways, with Mary returning to her home in the UK for the holidays. When she arrived back at university, Roy had moved in two doors down from her. “By chance, my roommate had moved home and a place turned up in Mary’s building,” he says. That September, he followed through on his promise to make her dinner. They quickly hit it off, and realised they had more in common than they’d thought. “He was on a PhD programme in geography and also had a Fulbright scholarship,” says Mary. “We were both vegetarians and had an interest in reading and travel. Roy had been all over the world and spoke different languages.” He was equally impressed. “I liked that Mary rode horses and had a different accent. She was the nicest person I’d ever met and was very easy to be with,” he says. Before long they were a couple. “We’d go for day trips to Lake Michigan and study together,” says Mary. “We met in such an intense way, through the accident, that it sort of got rid of that usual period where you get to know someone slowly.” In 1987, they married in the US before moving to England. “It’s a running joke in my family that he had to marry me or I’d sue him,” laughs Mary. By the following January, they had moved to Sudan for Roy’s work. He was studying the impacts of climate change in Africa, and Mary took a contract with Unicef, working in nutrition. “There was a coup while we were there and it became hard to get food, so it was a tough experience, but amazing, too,” Roy says. They returned to Michigan two years later, and their two children were born in 1990 and 92. Mary found a job as a dietitian while Roy became a professor at Grand Valley State University. When Mary suffered a brain bleed in 2012 and was put in an induced coma, Roy cared for her. “She was in hospital for two months and it took two years to fully recover,” he says. “We kept going together and it brought us even closer.” Just as the pandemic hit, they moved to St Louis to be close to their children, now adults themselves. “Having kids was always a priority for us,” says Mary. “We loved having them and they were the best thing that we ever did. We share the same values and always compromise for the same reasons.” Roy appreciates his partner’s poise and calm nature. “She doesn’t jump into the fray – she’s measured. It’s easy to have meaningful conversations and there’s never any drama. We laugh together all the time.” Want to share your story?

1/3/2022,"According to the UK’s Met Office: “The extremely mild spell is driven by a flow of warm, moist air pushing across the UK from the Canary Islands and further south in the Atlantic.” This has resulted in the “unusual situation of one weather system breaking weather records for two days in separate calendar years”.  Low pressure in the Atlantic below Iceland meant conditions were perfect for a stream of subtropical air known as the Azores plume to drift up to the UK. Michael Dukes, the director of forecasting at MetDesk, said: “This subtropical air came in on south to south-westerly winds across the UK. As the air mass came from so far south, temperatures were well above normal for the time of year with date records broken on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day.” According to the Met Office, 16.5C was reached at Bala, north Wales, on 31 December 2021, a New Year’s Eve record for the UK and Wales. (Not quite as warm as 29 December 2019, however, when the Azores plume also reached the UK and brought temperatures of 16.8C. The previous record for those dates had been 16.1C in 1925.) New Year’s Eve temperature records were set across all the other UK nations. Keswick in England reached 15.9C, Kinlochewe in Scotland reached 16.1C and Magilligan reached 15.0C in Northern Ireland. A daily minimum temperature of 13.2C recorded at Chivenor, Devon, is provisionally a new UK and England record for January, surpassing the previous UK record of 13.1C, set at Magilligan, in 2016 and the previous English record of 13.0C, set at London in 2008. There is also a new Welsh January daily minimum temperature record, 12.8C, which was recorded in Trawsgoed in Dyfed . This beats the previous record of 12.5C, set at Gogerddan, also in Dyfed, in 2016. On Sunday rain moved in from the west across the whole country. By Monday morning yellow weather warnings were being issued for snow and ice over parts of Scotland, with a band of cold and rain moving south over the rest of the UK, pushing back the warmth and bringing Arctic air with it. The Azores plume has drifted up to the UK before, most notably in 2019, as mentioned above. There are always areas of low and high pressure in the Atlantic, and when the conditions are right, subtropical air will be drawn up to the north. It is hard to link a single weather event to climate change, although the science in this field is improving rapidly. However, said Dukes, as the planet slowly warms it means “we are just a touch warmer than we used to be in similar weather set ups. So if this weather pattern had occurred in the 1980s, say, temperatures would still have been way above normal, but probably half a degree lower than they were on this occasion.”",News/UK news,Why has UK’s weather been so mild and is it linked to climate crisis?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/03/why-has-uk-weather-been-so-mild-and-is-it-linked-to-climate-crisis
1/3/2022,"A near-dozen-year-old legal settlement between Virginia Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender whom she accused of sexual abuse, is expected to be unsealed on Monday.  The unsealing stems from Giuffre’s sexual abuse lawsuit against Prince Andrew, which she filed on 9 August in Manhattan federal court. Giuffre has long accused Epstein and his sometime girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell – now a convicted sex-trafficker, after the conclusion of her New York trial last week – of forcing her into sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17. The Duke of York vehemently maintained his innocence. Prince Andrew filed Giuffre’s settlement with Epstein as part of his attempt to dismiss her case against him, arguing that it shields him. Lawyers for the prince contend that the settlement contains provisions that bar Giuffre from taking legal action against many of Epstein’s associates. “Giuffre settled her sex-trafficking and sexual-abuse claims against Epstein in 2009. In doing so, she provided Epstein with a general release of all claims against him and numerous other individuals and entities,” Andrew’s attorneys said in a court filing on 29 October court. “To avoid being dragged into future legal disputes, Epstein negotiated for this broad release, insisting that it cover any and all persons who Giuffre identified as potential targets of future lawsuits, regardless of the merit – or lack thereof – to any such claims.” The attorneys also said: “Because Prince Andrew is a senior member of the British royal family, he falls into one of the expressly identified categories of persons, ie, royalty, released from liability under the release agreement, along with politicians, academicians, businessmen, and others allegedly associated with Epstein. “As a third-party beneficiary of the release agreement, Prince Andrew is entitled to enforce the general release contained therein.” Prince Andrew’s lawyers also said the former Epstein attorney Alan Dershowitz was protected by this agreement. Giuffre has accused Dershowitz of sexual misconduct facilitated by Epstein, which he has repeatedly denied. Giuffre filed a defamation lawsuit against Dershowitz on 16 April 2019. Dershowitz filed the Epstein settlement agreement in his fight against that suit. “Professor Dershowitz, as a third-party beneficiary of the 2009 settlement agreement, was entitled to rely upon and enforce the terms of that secret deal,” lawyers for Prince Andrew said. On 14 December, explaining why the settlement should be filed publicly, judges in the Prince Andrew and Dershowitz cases said: “Mr Epstein, as is well known, is deceased. The document is well known to Ms Giuffre and, although under seal, has been available to all parties in these cases for some time. “We question whether any proper purpose would be served by the continued secrecy of the document save, perhaps, the dollar amount of the settlement it provided for.” On 29 December, judges ordered the unsealing of the agreement, saying nobody –including representatives of Epstein’s estate – had made an adequate showing as to why it should remain under wraps. They said it would be posted publicly to the docket “on or about 3 January 2022”. Lawyers for Giuffre have requested documents as part of her litigation, such as proof of Prince Andrew’s claim, in a notorious Newsnight interview, that he cannot sweat. Giuffre has claimed that he was “sweating profusely all over me” at a London discotheque on a night when she alleged they had sex. The duke said on Newsnight that allegation could not be true, “because I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don’t sweat or I didn’t sweat at the time”. The prince also maintained that on the day cited by Giuffre he took his daughter Beatrice to a late-afternoon children’s party at a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking, Surrey. Following the pizza party, he said, he was home with his children all night. Prince Andrew’s public profile has been damaged considerably by his controversial association with Maxwell and Epstein. On 29 December, a federal jury in Manhattan found Maxwell, the daughter of the late press baron Robert Maxwell, guilty on five counts – including sex trafficking – for luring girls as young as 14 into Epstein’s orbit for him to sexually abuse. Maxwell, 60, says she is innocent. Her lawyers said they planned to appeal. Epstein, who also counted former presidents Donald Trump and Bill Clinton among his associates, was arrested in July 2019 for sex trafficking teen girls. He killed himself about a month after his arrest in a New York jail, while awaiting trial.",News/US news,Jeffrey Epstein legal deal with Prince Andrew accuser to be unsealed,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/03/jeffrey-epstein-prince-andrew-virginia-giuffre
1/3/2022,"Thirty years ago, when Li Jingwei was four years old, a neighbour abducted him from his home village in China’s Yunnan province and sold him to a child trafficking ring. Now he has been reunited with his mother after drawing a map of his home village from his memories of three decades ago and sharing it on a popular video-sharing app in the hope that someone might be able to identify it.  “I’m a child who’s looking for his home,” Li said in the video. Unable to recall the name of his village or his address, Li’s recollection and reconstruction of the village’s key features – including a school, a bamboo forest and a pond – proved crucial. “I knew the trees, stones, cows and even which roads turn and where the water flows,” Li said in an interview with the Paper, a Chinese media outlet. Shared on Douyin – known outside China as TikTok – on 24 December, the map was matched by police to a Yunnan village where there was a woman whose son had disappeared. That son was identified as Li through DNA tests, leading to an emotional reunion on Saturday. Video footage showed Li carefully removing his mother’s mask to examine her face before breaking down in tears and embracing her. “Thirty-three years of waiting, countless nights of yearning, and finally a map hand-drawn from memory, this is the moment of perfect release after 13 days,” Li wrote on his Douyin profile before the reunion. “Thank you everyone who has helped me reunite with my family.” He told the Paper: “My mother cried as soon as I got on the phone. After the video call, I recognised her at a glance. My mother and I have the same lips, even my teeth.” Abducted in 1989, Li was sold to a family in Lankao, more than 1,100 miles away. Child abductions are common in China and Li was probably taken because the family wanted a boy. Li said he was inspired to look for his biological family after seeing high-profile stories in the media describing two other abduction cases that ended in reunions. He mentioned the case of Guo Gangtang, who became a media celebrity after searching for his missing son for 24 years, travelling more than 300,000 miles by motorbike in his eventually successful search. “When I saw the story of Guo Gangtang, I thought to myself: I should try to find my biological parents … I wanted to see them when they are still alive,” Li said. “I realised I could not wait any longer because my parents should be getting older now. I worried that when I figured out where I am from, they might have passed away,” he told Henan Television after posting his map. Now living in Guangdong province in southern China, Li had had no success in asking his adoptive parents – who he said had brought him up well – or consulting DNA databases about his origins.",News/World news,Abducted son finds family by drawing map of village he last saw aged four,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/abducted-son-li-jingwei-finds-family-map-of-village-china
1/3/2022,"The UK is rapidly approaching peak Netflix with the streaming giant attracting the lowest number of new subscribers in 2021 since launching a decade ago, as it turns to a new generation of “silver streamers” for future growth. With a seemingly endless pipeline of big-budget content, from House of Cards to The Crown and Squid Game, a binge-watching strategy and bargain basement pricing, Netflix has revolutionised traditional TV watching and won millions of British fans.  In 2021, however, it is estimated that it attracted just 800,000 new subscribers as it approaches saturation point in British homes. “It is peak Netflix, in the sense we are never likely to see the scale of subscriber additions we have seen over the past few years,” says Richard Broughton, a director of Ampere Analysis, a market research firm. “Netflix will continue to grow, but at a much slower rate.” Globally, Netflix has said it expects to report 18.4 million new subscribers for 2021, when it reports its full-year figures next month, taking its global base to 222 million. The rate of growth is half that seen in 2020 as rolling pandemic lockdowns led to almost 37 million new signups, the most the streaming giant has ever managed in a single year. While the streaming landscape was once a duopoly, Netflix’s rapid early success prompted Amazon to match its international expansion by rolling out Prime Video. There is now significant competition from both global rivals and burgeoning domestic services. The serendipitously timed launch of Disney+ at the start of the pandemic, populated by hit content such as the $100m (£74m) Star Wars TV spin-off The Mandalorian, resulted in the service adding more UK subscribers in a year in 2020 than any other streaming platform has ever managed. And since 2018, Amazon’s Prime Video, which has built its content base beyond entertainment into live sport including Premier League football and international rugby, has outperformed Netflix in annual subscriber growth in the UK. The pandemic has fuelled record-setting growth. However, this accelerated uptake has “pulled forward” many of those who would have signed up in the coming years, hastening Netflix’s shift towards saturation in mature markets such as the UK. In the US, new subscriber growth has stalled this year. “Netflix has tapped out the early adopter base and is now trying to convert audiences more resistant to paying, to the concept of streaming services and who find Netflix’s content less appealing to their taste,” says Broughton. Which leads us to ask who Netflix is now targeting, and will need to target, to continue to eke out growth in the UK market. Netflix has already burned through most of the younger demographics most comfortable with new technology, and to whom the larger proportion of content is likely to appeal. About four-fifths of people aged 18 to 34 in the UK with internet connections are now estimated to be either subscribers or have access through their families or shared passwords, according to research from Ampere. This is almost identical in the US. In the 35- to 44-year-old bracket about 70% have access, while there is more hope for new converts among those aged 45-54, with the demographic just 62% won over by Netflix’s charms. The biggest opportunity is among older people: only half of those aged 55 to 64, and who are internet-connected, are subscribed or have access to Netflix. “The one thing holding Netflix back from converting more households is those that are not converting don’t like all the content Netflix currently offers,” says Broughton. “These are older consumers, whose likes are more akin to traditional UK broadcast channels. They like things such as more local productions. Netflix is beginning to tap into that with more new productions targeting these consumers.” While Ampere does not have information available about older demographics, the internet service provider TalkTalk says analysis of its network has shown that the pandemic has fuelled a rise of the “silver streamers”. Internet usage has risen more among over-75s than in any other demographic since pre-pandemic summer 2019, up 72%, as stay-at-home health restrictions forced them to become “more comfortable with leading online lives”, according to TalkTalk. The next biggest rise in usage was in the 65- to 74-year-old demographic, up 66%. “Silver streamers is now a big thing,” says Jonathan Kini, the managing director of TalkTalk Business. “Everyone is looking for more choice and when we look at research on the top 10 streamed shows among over-65s you see a number of Netflix programmes including The Crown, Bridgerton and Squid Game. Streaming shows on Netflix now accounts for a fifth of all peak traffic on our network.” A knock-on effect of Netflix having hoovered up most of the easiest converts is the rising marketing costs of attracting these harder-to-win-over potential subscribers. In Netflix’s earlier years, when new subscribers came with little effort, a single subscriber cost about $40 to $50 in the US and probably a little lower in the UK. It is estimated to have now potentially tripled in mature markets reaching saturation. When Netflix’s inexorably rising production and licensing budget – expected to hit $17bn globally this year to keep subscribers happy and compete effectively against burgeoning numbers of deep-pocketed rivals – is factored in, subscribers can expect more price rises. In March, Netflix put up the price of its most-popular package by £1 a month to £9.99, not a huge increase given a decade ago at launch it was priced at £6.99, but as saturation comes closer to reality there will be more pressure to revisit prices more frequently. Netflix’s growing pains from streaming upstart to fixture in the TV landscape will be mirrored by its rivals, with its position as the most popular streaming service in the UK set to remain intact even as growth slows. Disney, which despite having popular franchises including Marvel, Pixar and Disney classics, is expected to saturate markets sooner because it has a narrower range of content overall. There are already signs of this trend in the UK where its record 3.5 million subscribers in its first year of operations in 2020, has slowed to just 1.2 million this year. While Netflix’s closest competitor, Amazon, is still growing at a faster rate – it is expected to add 1.3 million regular video users this year compared with Netflix’s 800,000 – it is not forecast to become the market leader in the coming years. “The situation Netflix finds itself is more an indication of historic success in achieving impressive scale rather than a particular fundamental issue facing the UK business,” says Broughton. “Netflix reaches about half of UK households. At its best Sky TV peaked at a little under 40% in 2011, although it faced an arguably harder task with a highly priced service – an enviously impressive position for any subscription business.” 1 Line of Duty2 The Crown3 Peaky Blinders4 Bridgerton5 Squid Game6 The Queen’s Gambit7 The Handmaid’s Tale8 Tiger King9 Below Deck10 Normal People Source: TalkTalk",News/Media,As UK hits peak Netflix the streaming giant will have to work harder,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/03/uk-hits-peak-netflix-streaming-giant-work-harder-suscriber-growth
