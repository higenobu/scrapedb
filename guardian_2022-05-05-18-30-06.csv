5/5/2022,"Just as many of us grasped for connections during lockdown, the pandemic has inspired Eunic London, an umbrella organisation for EU cultural institutions, to dwell on the meaning of relationships for this year’s showcase for European short films, put together by curator Shira Macleod. Not all are – as the strand’s subtitle would have it – loving encounters: break-ups, bureaucratic frustration and unsettling alien fauna crop up, too. And the one explicitly Covid-related work, Romanian director Alina Manolache’s mesmerising I Am Here, features relationships by their absence: the social vacuum on display in CCTV footage from the Trevi Fountain, Chinese pharmacies, a British golf course and other depopulated locations around the world. Relationships take a politicised shade in Alexandra Matheou’s A Summer Place, a lush dalliance between a Cypriot food artist and the Arab refugee she rescues from the sea. But its Paolo Sorrentino-esque scenes of excess draw the lines between European haves and outsider have-nots somewhat heavy-handedly. More subtle on the immigration beat is the forlorn black-and-white drama Beyond Is the Day, from Poland’s Damian Kocur, which turns an out-of-the-way river barge into an intercontinental metaphor. Eunic’s selection broadly tries to buoy us up as societies emerge from the pandemic with an upbeat view of relationships, as in the delightful Forest Coal Pit, by Siôn Marshall-Waters, about a pair of elderly Welsh brothers who, despite the rigours of running their farm, are never short on wonder about the world. “Well, they’re in perpetual motion, shrews, aren’t they?” one marvels. But there’s an anxious pulse to Cuckoo!, in which Dutch director Jörgen Scholtens puts his cuckoo clock-dwelling protagonist on a tight schedule, ensuring an elderly lady takes her medication; it plays like an absurdist Werther’s Original advert. An even angstier mother frets about sexual predators on behalf of her gay son in Are You Hungry?, creating a honeytrap profile for him as “Tomi of Finland”. But Teemu Niukkanen’s droll and sharply characterised feature asserts that the kids are alright. “I like rainbows as natural phenomena,” deadpans Tomi about his LGBT-flagging T-shirt. Most striking are two shorts from Croatia and Scotland. The resplendent Into the Blue is a teenage love triangle unfolding in a relaxed riviera setting, only with intense undercurrents. Gracija Filipovic is darkly seductive as the interloper crashing her childhood friend’s budding romance, while director Antoneta Alamat Kusijanović makes the sapphire depths undulate with loneliness and liberation. Josephine Lohoar Self’s animation The Fabric of You sounds cosier, but there’s an unsettling texture to its tryst between a Bronx mouse tailor and his well-spoken client. This rodent Remains of the Day discourses smoothly on the link between fashion and dissimulation, while its frayed, writhing stop-motion hints at agony beneath the breast. The standard of work is perhaps more consistent than that of last year’s group, but it’s also notable that, with plenty in the 15- to 25-minute range, the selection pushes the definition of short. One final mention then to Maria Fredriksson’s documentary entry Svonni vs the Swedish Tax Agency, which manages to pack in a tale of one women and her dog, her struggle to get it recognised as tax-deductible, and the broader context of Sami reindeer herding, in a succinct and springy five minutes. Brief encounters can be the most intense.

5/5/2022,"With its sterile setting and staff in scrubs, it looks like the video feed of a hospital waiting room – but the scene captured on screen is the virtual trial of Jeanine Áñez, Bolivia’s former president, who is beaming in to the sessions from prison. Áñez stands accused of assuming the presidency by unconstitutional means, and could face up to 15 years in prison. But the trial is unfolding amid accusations that the governing Movimiento al Socialismo (Mas) is pursuing its opponents through the justice system. The current case examines three tumultuous days between the resignation of President Evo Morales on 10 November 2019 and the swearing-in of Áñez. Three weeks earlier, Morales had won a fourth consecutive term, despite a previous pledge to leave at the end of his third term as stipulated by Bolivia’s 2009 constitution. Disputed allegations of electoral fraud then sparked nationwide protests. Eventually the police mutinied, and the military suggested Morales leave power. Bolivia was without a president for two days, until Áñez, a little-known senator from a minor rightwing party, assumed the position. She promised new elections, which eventually took place in October 2020. The Mas, led by Luis Arce, the former finance minister, came back to power in a landslide. Áñez was arrested in March 2021 and has been in pre-trial detention since. The current trial focuses on how Áñez vaulted from second vice-president of the senate to president, a path which opened up when the vice-president and the leaders of the two chambers followed Morales in resigning. Separately, the government intends to try Áñez over two massacres committed by security forces during her presidency, in Senkata and Sacaba. The prosecution claims that Añez’s sucession was unconstitutional – and that she had support from the security forces. Numerous generals are on trial with her. Áñez’s defence claims that there was a power vacuum and the presidency fell to her. “I was the product or the consequence of this situation,” she said in her oral testimony. “That was my crime: bringing peace to the country, assuming power by constitutional succession.” The prosecution has said it expects sentences to be passed shortly, but few expect the verdict to bring an end to Bolivia’s stark political polarisation. Mas and its supporters believe there was a coup, while the opposition argue Áñez was fulfilling her duty – and that this trial is both illegitimate and political, designed to cover up electoral fraud in the 2019 election. The situation has been exacerbated by the apparent lack of due process. In Bolivia, former presidents should in theory face a “trial of responsibilities”, authorised by a two-thirds majority in the legislative assembly. But the prosecution opted to try Áñez as a citizen, since the trial concerns events before she became president. Other doubts over the trial include Áñez’s extensive pre-trial detention, the lack of care she has received for medical problems, and the fact that the case has been heard virtually, rather than in-person – even though in-person trials resumed in Bolivia months ago. The process has taken a toll on Áñez, who appeared to have an anxiety attack and faint on screen during the first days of the trial. Áñez’s daughter and her lawyers have given tearful press conferences to argue that her treatment is inhumane, even sharing her blood pressure readings. These doubts are contested, but they have nonetheless undermined the trial in the eyes of many. “The government is under a magnifying glass, and they should be doing this perfectly,” said Thomas Becker, a lawyer working with the victims of the Senkata and Sacaba massacres. “And I think there have been procedural problems.” More broadly, some see the case against Áñez as part of a pattern of political persecution. Numerous members of her administration, and some supporters from civil society, have either been arrested or fled the country. But this is not unique to the current government, notes María Teresa Zegada, a Bolivian sociologist. Áñez’s government persecuted members of Morales’s government; Morales’s government pursued its opponents, too. “It’s a vicious cycle of score-settling,” said Zegada. This reflects the pliability of Bolivia’s justice system to those in power – something widely recognised in the country, as well as by Human Rights Watch and the UN special rapporteur who visited the country this year – and only makes it less likely the opposition, and society as a whole, will accept the trial’s outcome as impartial. “Bolivia remains a polarised country, and there’s not a lot of trust across the political divide,” said Carwil Bjork-James, an anthropologist. “Then there is a recurrent problem, which is a lack of trust in the independence of the judicial apparatus. And that makes any trial challenging right now.”",News/World news,Accidental president or coup-plotter?

5/5/2022,"Charles is a property developer who has built private prisons in Iowa. He is also an art collector. The paintings in his house are not just hung up; they are “curated”. It is as if the art has been incarcerated on his walls. Yet this man sees himself as one of the good guys. Claudia Rankine’s riveting play is like Yasmina Reza’s Art given political purpose. Charles is a white liberal who believes he is counterbalancing a history of racism by accumulating the work of black artists – amusingly rendered in written descriptions on the walls of Debbie Duru’s chic set. Played by Matthew Pidgeon in Natalie Ibu’s excellent production, he has the suave assurance of a CEO but also a convincing air of even-handedness. Which makes him all the more of a problem. It doesn’t take much to expose the limits of the white liberalism of his wife, Virginia. Played by Kate Copeland, she snaps under pressure, blandly cheering on black icons such as Serena Williams and Michelle Obama but recoiling in the face of real racial conflict. Blind to her own advantages, she wishes people would just get along. Likewise, Nick Blakeley’s Eric, a white art dealer, cares more for fine wine than addressing the questions his merchandise raises. So when a tremendous Estella Daniels arrives as Charlotte, a celebrated black artist whose photographs reconstruct unseen moments of racial violence, she sees Charles as her most serious adversary. Exhibiting not rancour but a deep moral sense, she chooses to look at him in the same way he looks at her. He does not like it. His privilege is not just in his wealth, it is in his very skin; a skin he takes for granted. It puts him – and by implication, every white person in the audience – at the centre of his own universe. In this way, his championing of black artists looks less like a progressive gesture than a fetishisation of dead black bodies. Yet Rankine’s is a subtle debate. Like their names, Charles and Charlotte are mirror images, each damaged and defined by their cultural experience. Tense and timely, The White Card points fingers, but also points the way to positive change. At Northern Stage, Newcastle, until 14 May.

5/5/2022,"Ukraine, with some western help, has won a great victory, and the original aim of Russia’s invasion – to capture Kyiv and replace the Ukrainian government – has been utterly defeated. The Russian army has now regrouped in the east for a much more limited objective: that of capturing the whole of the Russian-populated Donbas region, which Moscow has already recognised as independent. If the Russian army can achieve this in the coming weeks then we cannot say for sure what Moscow’s next move would be. However, Russia has suffered huge casualties among its elite troops, and even taking the relatively small city of Mariupol has taken two months and required reducing the city to ruins. In view of this, a further Russian campaign to capture much bigger cities such as Odesa looks implausible, and it seems possible Russia could go on the defensive, and offer a ceasefire and peace talks. Putin will pretend to the Russian people that taking a bit of extra territory in the Donbas has been a victory for Russia, but there is no need for the west to agree with him. The truth is that this war has proved a military, political and moral catastrophe for Russia. The reputation of the Russian army has been shredded; Russia’s economy is badly damaged; and the European Union is moving with surprising speed and resolution to end its dependence on Russian oil and, more slowly, gas. This would suggest that in future, Russia will be dependent on China as a market for its gas – meaning both political subordination to China and its ability to set the price for it. What are the wider implications of Russia’s defeat? The first is that on the most important issue by far – that of Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and western alignment – Ukraine (and the west) have already won. That should allow a degree of flexibility when it comes to compromises over territorial issues, especially since most of the territories concerned have been held by Russia since 2014. Second, if there ever was a Russian plan to use Ukraine as a springboard for further aggression, that too is now over. If the Russian army cannot capture cities less than 20 miles from Russia, it is hardly likely to invade Nato. Russia will no doubt defend the positions it already holds, in defence of breakaway territories in Moldova, Georgia and Nagorno-Karabakh. If the war in Ukraine continues, there will be an increasing danger that Georgia and Azerbaijan will again seek to recover their lost territory by force. The result would be a much wider and even more dangerous conflict. Such an extension of the war will be greatly encouraged if Ukraine becomes a US proxy war against Russia, as the Biden administration apparently now intends. The defence secretary Lloyd Austin has said the US should use the war in Ukraine to “weaken” Russia in order to prevent it invading more countries. Important voices in the US and Britain have said we should help Ukraine to win a complete victory, by which they seem to mean drive Russia from all the territories it has taken since 2014, and impose such a humiliating defeat that the Putin regime is overthrown. Incredibly, it has been suggested that US support for the Mujahideen in Afghanistan in the 1980s – with all its appalling consequences for Afghanistan, the US and the Middle East – is some sort of positive model for this. Western public acceptance for the economic suffering created by sanctions has been mobilised through the argument that this is necessary to defend Ukraine and stop Russian aggression. Permanently weakening or even destroying Russia is a very different matter. Support for Ukraine is legitimate and necessary, but it has also already achieved its most important goal: that of preserving Ukrainian independence and sovereignty over the great majority of Ukrainian territory, and deterring further Russian aggression. It is also horribly dangerous. In the first place, for the Ukrainians to attack entrenched Russian positions across open country would be a very different matter from defending Ukrainian cities. The tactical advantage would inevitably shift to Russia. Ukraine could thereby suffer immense losses and turn victory into defeat. If, on the other hand, Ukraine – with western backing – did seem on the verge of complete victory, the threat to Putin’s regime and to Russian vital interests would be such that it really would seem possible Russia might escalate to missile strikes against Nato supply lines in Poland, in an effort to terrify France and Germany into making a separate peace. Once a Nato member is attacked, there will be tremendous pressure in the US to declare a no-fly zone in Ukraine – in other words, to send the US air force into action to support the Ukrainian forces on the ground. Some of these planes will then be shot down by missile batteries based in Russia itself. How long would the US accept these casualties before launching attacks on Russian territory? We would then be faced with a prospect that, during the cold war, eight US presidents took great care to avoid: Russia and Nato firing missiles into each other’s territory, and a direct conflict in Europe between two nuclear superpowers, with the ability between them to destroy humanity. US presidents did not exercise this restraint out of sympathy for the Soviet Union, but from a cold calculation of the terrible risks involved. And running these risks is unnecessary, given the strategic defeat we have already helped to inflict on Russia.

5/5/2022,"Aubrey, a 26-year-old in Florida, does not recommend working at a hotel in the middle of a pandemic. The floors were constantly understaffed and inventory seemed to disappear overnight. In fact, Aubrey was genuinely relieved when she was finally laid off. And like so many newly occupation-free members of the American workforce, Aubrey turned to the internet and beseeched any sort of minimal-effort side-hustle that seemed feasible. Aubrey found hope with what she describes as “low-content books”. With just a layman’s grasp of graphic design, Aubrey was able to flood the Amazon marketplace with a tide of scholastic notebooks, graph-paper pamphlets and crossword collections. There is no real writing involved in the low-content book scheme, which is exactly the point. All Aubrey needs to do is come up with an appetizing front cover and trust that the shadowy algorithm takes care of business. “My most successful product is randomly a ‘vegetable’ blank lined notebook where I just scattered some pictures of cartoonish onions, pumpkins and leeks on the cover,” she tells me. “It has done pretty well and is about $200 of my sales.” Aubrey isn’t breaking the bank, but she’s emblematic of a growing contingency in the global economy that’s lured by the hope of cobbling together “passive income” streams online. Over 47 million people quit their jobs last year, leaving many to exchange their long-term career ambitions with low-stakes schemes to make money from home. Interest in the r/passive_income subreddit, where users swap tips on earning extra cash, skyrocketed throughout the pandemic, while Google search inquiries on “passive income” have more than doubled since March 2020. And more people are now making money through unconventional means – the number of self-employed people who reported “unincorporated” work (meaning they weren’t tied to a specific company) has gone up from 8.8m in March 2020 to 9.3m in March 2022, according to the Department of Labor. There’s a genuine reorientation in the nation’s labor philosophy, and it seems to grow more fervent with each passing day. “As a result of the pandemic, most people realized that a seemingly safe job or industry can change overnight, and we really can’t predict those circumstances,” says Dorie Clark, a professor at Duke’s Fuqua School of Business and the author of Entrepreneurial You. “The best security comes from having multiple income streams and diversification. When we can’t know the future, you need to place multiple bets.” Nobody should take a get-rich-quick scheme at face value, but it’s not hard to understand why Americans were more motivated than ever to wrest control of their own financial fate. We all spent 2020 simultaneously bored and terrified as the economy tanked and the contagion spread. Many of us found ourselves out of a paycheck, and more importantly, reconsidering our foundational conceptions of work. Trauma and clarity are congenitally entwined, and after a year stuck at home, disgruntled employees wondered aloud if they were truly happy returning to a life of clocking in and out. It’s not that Aubrey particularly relishes her low-content book ruse, but at the very least, it doesn’t make her hate her life. “The pandemic was almost a blessing in disguise because I was ready to work at that hotel for the rest of my life,” she says. It’s enticing to believe that your savings account could swell by the turning gears of idle clicks. Yes, it’s possible; the pandemic has transformed some career nine-to-fivers into overnight barons. Just ask Kat Norton, a 28-year-old in Long Island, who was condemned to her home in 2020 after her consulting job restricted travel in accordance with the lockdowns. Norton suddenly had a lot of time on her hands, so she started uploading quirky Excel tutorials on TikTok. Those videos went viral, and within months Norton quit her job to create a platform called “Miss Excel” – where she authors tutorials for the whole Microsoft Office suite. Norton tells me she works about 20 hours a week, and that her business is now worth over $1m. Everything fell into its right place. “The pandemic was a massive pattern disruptor,” she says. “A lot of times your day job feels a lot less glamorous when we’re working from home. Travel was the fun part of my job. When I was whipping out securitizations from my childhood bedroom I was like, ‘Dang.’” Norton took full advantage of her newfound liberty. She and her boyfriend roamed the country as digital nomads; renting a house for a spell in Hawaii or California every few months, living the good life. (Norton has since purchased a permanent home in Colorado.) It’s an incredible success story and also a total outlier from the mean, but that hasn’t stopped a tide of charlatans willing to sell their guarded secrets of passive income salvation; as if anyone can immediately start raking in easy revenue if they simply know what buttons to push. It’s a tale as old as time. In 2019, Alana Semuels covered a story for the Atlantic about a New York couple who purchased a $3,999 training course from the e-commerce partnership of Matt Behdjou and Mike Gazzola, two of the more famous gurus in the passive income universe at the time. The course promised to teach them how to resell items imported from China at a massive profit through Amazon. But the products were ultimately difficult to distribute at scale, and the couple quickly found themselves $40,000 underwater. The fantasies of financial freedom through ambient gains revealed themselves to be laughably counterfeit; all engineered by a pair of scammers who left their clients holding the bag. (Behdjou and Gazzola were eventually sued by Amazon.) “It may seem obvious to an outsider that most people aren’t going to become rich by selling things on Amazon,” wrote Semuels. “But that’s the thing about gold rushes: Some people do find gold, and it is sometimes hard to tell what distinguishes the people who make it from those who don’t.” Indeed, it’s easy to fall into this trap the deeper you delve into the passive income universe. YouTube is littered with young influencers promoting their financial wisdom – usually conjoined with questionably optimistic thumbnails. “9 Passive Income Ideas, how I make $27,000 per week,” reads one, uploaded by one prominent advice-giver named Ali Abdaal. One of the ideas he mentions? Selling classes online. Abdaal uses one of his recent webinars as an example: It’s titled “Starting a Successful Side Hustle”. Effectively, Abdaal is telling his viewers that an effective way to harvest cash out of the ether is to teach others to do the same; an ouroboros that proves just how flimsy the precepts of passive income can be. But many people who entered this ecosystem during the pandemic are charting a far more realistic future. Brett Parsons, a 41-year-old dad in the Bay Area, simply wanted an outlet that melded his pecuniary and emotional interests. He’s a longtime tabletop gaming hobbyist, and enjoys painting miniature plastic soldiers that add up into Warhammer armies. As the world ground to a halt, and his full-time career was left in stasis, Parsons started selling his models on eBay. Covid proved that there didn’t need to be a discernible difference between what he did for work and what he did for fun. “I realized I could use the extra income to pay rent, and to support that by selling an army would be great. I sold my first army for 400 or 500 bucks,” says Parsons. “It’s almost like I’m getting paid to do therapy … It relieves stress for me and makes money at the same time.”",News/US news,The jobless Americans chasing the dream of ‘passive income’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/05/passive-income-jobless-americans-pandemic
5/5/2022,"After 42 games, Dover Athletic sit at the foot of the National League with zero points. They have scored 34 goals but conceded 97 on their way to achieving literally nothing. There will, however, be an asterisk next to their name when the campaign ends in two matches’ time. The Whites were given a 12-point deduction for failing to fulfil fixtures last season, putting an almost entirely new squad on the back foot before a ball was kicked. The deficit was made up thanks to two victories and six draws, leaving them where every other team began. The part-timers’ first league win came in January against Eastleigh – a result celebrated like “we had won the Champions League”, one player told the Guardian – to avoid the ignominy of going a calendar year without a victory. They specialise in glorious failure. For example, Dover went 5-2 up at Hollywood’s Wrexham, only to lose 6-5 thanks to a 98th-minute winner. A visit to Bromley is their next chance of moving off nought before the crunch final-day fixture at Weymouth, who have also been relegated, to ensure the season wasn’t all for nothing. History has been made by Hertfordshire’s Cheshunt: they reached the last 16 of the FA Trophy, won the county cup and on Monday secured promotion to the National League South through the playoffs. Their opponents in the final were Hornchurch, who may have felt fate was on their side when they came from 2-1 down in the 87th minute against Enfield Town in the semis. Cheshunt triumphed, though, thanks to goals from Amadou Kassaraté and Zack Newton. Kassaraté, a former Senegal youth international, fits perfectly in an eclectic squad that includes players with senior caps for Saint-Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda and Saint Vincent and Grenadines, not to mention an Italian, Dutchman, Frenchman and Australian. “The team’s resilience is unmatched,” says Kassaraté, who had a spell in the Greek third division. “Throughout the season we have been counted out, but as players and the management we always find a way to unite and win. That belief comes from the amazing fans, board and everyone associated with Cheshunt.” Any club nicknamed the Seadogs deserves success and respect in equal measure. Scarborough Athletic have earned promotion to the National League North, 23 years after their now defunct predecessors Scarborough dropped out of the Football League thanks to goalkeeper Jimmy Glass’s famous last-minute goal for Carlisle. The phoenix club were founded in 2007 and are 100% owned by fans. The Seadogs can even boast a Champions League winner as manager, in hometown boy Jonathan Greening, who had a more enjoyable May in 1999 than Scarborough. Among his charges is fellow Scarborian Michael Coulson, who started his career with Scarborough before spells at Barnsley, Grimsby and St Johnstone. Fittingly he scored in the playoff final win over Warrington Town to secure sixth-tier football. “If you have our corner flag and post could you please return it to the club for our remaining events,” read the Taunton Town tweet, finally a statement befitting a corner flag photo. The Peacocks required their precious flag and post back after winning the Southern League Premier Division to guarantee promotion to the National League South, the highest level the club have competed at in their 75-year history. An incredible 2,303 turned up at the Cygnet Health Care Stadium to watch Taunton beat their promotion rivals Farnborough to seal the title, and one member of the crowd has been rewarded with a signed corner flag after returning it. Within their squad was the 50-year-old coach Michael Meaker, a midfielder who represented Queens Park Rangers in the Premier League, making his debut as a 19-year-old against Manchester City way back in 1990. Meaker appeared 13 times for the Peacocks this season but has decided the step up to the National League South would be too much for his ageing body. “I’ve been lucky to have enjoyed such a long career when I’ve played in all divisions of the Football League, apart from League Two, and have been involved in winning league titles, playoffs and various Sausage Cups*,” Meaker told the club’s website after hanging up his boots. *Sausage Cup is a nickname for the Southern League Challenge Cup. Clubs are often criticised for taking short flights to games but it has been very necessary for Isle of Man FC, who enjoyed their inaugural season in the North West Counties First Division South. They travelled for games against teams such as Abbey Hey, Barnton and Eccleshall but a home playoff against New Mills was the most important. A 4-2 win over the Derbyshire side sealed promotion. The islanders, who are unpaid, had to play many home fixtures away because Covid restrictions meant opponents could not enter the Isle of Man, making their achievement all the more remarkable. Before challenging those from the mainland, the club sought advice from clubs around Europe, including Athletic Bilbao, in an attempt to learn how to operate as outsiders. Like Athletic, there is a regional selection policy, with only Manx players allowed.

5/5/2022,"Australia’s defence minister declared he has “no doubt” the Chinese Communist party wants the Morrison government to lose the election, prompting the opposition to denounce the appeasement claims as a “conspiracy theory”. Peter Dutton was challenged during a debate on Thursday to defend the government’s rhetoric that a Labor government would “appease” the CCP – after previous pushback from current and former national security officials – and said he believed it “very strongly”. The shadow minister, Brendan O’Connor, said the appeasement claim was baseless because both major Australian parties had the same policy in dealing with a “more assertive, more aggressive, more coercive” China. O’Connor acknowledged the risk of foreign interference, saying “you will see China involve itself in our matters from time to time improperly”, but said that Dutton’s line of attack against Labor was tailored for his own political purposes. The exchange occurred during a spirited policy debate at the National Press Club in Canberra, during which O’Connor challenged Dutton over his previous commentary about a war over Taiwan, and the defence minister attempted to pressure the Labor MP over asylum seeker policy. Dutton stood by the comment he made in November that it would be “inconceivable” Australia would not join the US in such a conflict with China. When asked whether, on reflection, answering a hypothetical about a war with a nuclear superpower was the right thing to do, Dutton said Australia was “a great and reliable friend and ally”. Dutton said: “So, do I think that we would shirk away from our responsibility to be a good ally with the United States? No, I don’t. And I don’t think that that would be in the interests of our country.” Dutton pointed to previous statements by the former Labor leader Mark Latham in an attempt to prosecute the argument Labor would even pose a risk to the US alliance. “I think that you would put us in an incredibly precarious position if Labor again decided to break the alliance with the United States. I think that that would be a travesty,” Dutton said to O’Connor. O’Connor said the suggestion that Labor would break the alliance was “absurd”. “That’s never happened,” O’Connor said. Dutton attempted to pressure O’Connor over asylum seeker policy, saying that when the Labor MP “sat around the national security committee table, you were responsible for the arrival of some 12,000 people and 184 boats”. Dutton asked: “What do you say to the men and women of the Australian Navy who are still suffering from PTSD today from having pulled those bodies from the water of those women and children who drowned at sea?” O’Connor, a former minister for immigration, replied that he had “enormous admiration for the customs and naval personnel who rescued people at sea, who were going to dangerous situations in high sea stakes”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “And I can remember vividly in 2010 when I flew into Christmas Island on the day that that un-seaworthy vessel floundered on the rocks off Christmas Island,” he said. “I was involved with the administrator having to set up a temporary morgue of people. “It was a devastating time for those people, for naval and customs personnel, who I later on met privately because of their brave actions.” O’Connor said that he was “very much instrumental in moving and changing the policy of the ALP to take on a more deterrent position” in relation to asylum seeker boat journeys. He attempted to turn the heat back to Dutton, given that the Coalition helped block the Gillard government’s Malaysia solution. “But I’ll tell you this, I didn’t join up with the Greens like Scott Morrison, Tony Abbott and Peter Dutton, to stop us trying to put in place a Malaysian arrangement,” O’Connor said.",News/Australia news,Labor denounces Peter Dutton’s ‘conspiracy theory’ that China wants Coalition to lose election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/05/peter-dutton-says-he-very-strongly-believes-chinese-communist-party-wants-coalition-to-lose-election

HV This week, Danielle Koku chooses five of the best music podcasts, from a hip-hop nostalgia hit to a show shining a light on the evolution of Latin American music Dissect PodcastCole Cuchna is all about the details in Dissect, dedicating each season to a single album before breaking down its lyrics, production, cover art and more for our listening pleasure. It’s ‘nerding out’ of the highest degree, but for good reason. The most recent season is a deep dive into Bo Burnham’s satirical lockdown hit Outside, while previous seasons have ventured into the late Mac Miller’s Swimming in Circles, Childish Gambino’s Because of the Internet, and Beyoncé’s Lemonade. In an age of cut-and-paste pop, but it is endearing to listen to artistic analysis that feels far from disposable. PopcastA detached attitude towards discussing music doesn’t tend to make for an interesting podcast. Gladly, this series from The New York Times does a great job of filling you in without pretending to be neutral. Hosted by seasoned critic Jon Caramanica, it has covered everything from the global expansion of Reggaeton to Adele’s recent return, dealing with trends from a US perspective. If you’re the type to time your podcast to your commute, this one will have you over and out in an hour, feeling like you can tie together various cultural threads into a neat little bow. Don’t Alert The StansJournalist Nicolas-Tyrell Scott, publicist Sope Soetan, and self-confessed album nerd Eden Mckenzie host this conversational show, in which they aim to keep music’s often wrath-fuelled fanbases at arm’s length. In lieu of reactive music takes like those served up by the much-decorated Joe Budden, they are fans of deeper, hour-plus dives. As well as recounting Twitter memes for a quick laugh, the trio contextualise ongoing debates and wider themes. They’re also not afraid to discuss female rappers, without the arrogance and misogyny often directed towards them. Alt.LatinoFelix Contreras and Cat Sposato keep to the storytelling tradition that underpins much of Latin American culture in their NPR series. They take a historical approach to celebrating the past glory of Latinas in Punk, for example, before facing forward and seeking out their modern reincarnations. In the episode Encore: The Meteoric Rise of Latin Urban Explained, listeners are treated to a primer on the movement as we see it now. Coming in at an easy breezy 24 minutes, it explains not only the rise in ‘papi’ references in pop, but the racial and cultural differences that dictate who has visibility in these spaces. Rhymes like Dimes PodcastFor hip-hop fans who are also suckers for nostalgia, and there is something sweet and familiar about this show hosted by two brothers and an old friend. South London-based music journalist Yemi Abiade is joined by his sibling Peter and their pal Moe to offer up weekly discussions on the genre, complete with the kind of polite critique that Brits are well admired for. If you need a quick explainer on why the UK’s grime scene doesn’t need American validation or an introduction to the eternal battle between lyrical-obsessed “oldheads” and hype-dazed youngsters present in most subcultures, this is the show for you. Tales of (almost) wedded bliss with Made In Chelsea’s endearingly posh Jamie and Sophie in NearlyWeds Shocking Victorian crimes get a feminist reexamination in Lady Killers with Lucy Worsley.

5/5/2022,"Moments after crossing the wire second in a field of 20, the big lanky filly Eight Belles collapsed in the dirt with two shattered front ankles. Bone pierced flesh as she struggled to stand but could not. The lather on her dark coat and the blood on her mangled legs glistened under the late afternoon sun. In the charming grandstand of Churchill Downs, a sea of rainbow costumes and made-up faces froze in horror and disbelief. Fists gripped wagering tickets and sweating cocktails while jaws hung agape beneath garish hats decorated with netting and cheap plastic flowers. Her life, just entering its third year, ended there in the dirt against the backdrop of the antique twin spires, the pain and suffering in her eyes witnessed only by those standing over her as the track vet pushed in the lethal dose to end her suffering. Had Eight Belles survived the 2008 Kentucky Derby she would be 17 now, a horse approaching her golden years. But it was not to be, due the overwhelming stress brought upon her by what she was made to do. Such has also been the fate of countless racehorses since her. A number in the thousands to be sure though, due to a long-running lack of racing industry regulation, record keeping, transparency and willingness, the true statistic can never be known. We approach this year’s Derby on Saturday in the wake of a death that, like Eight Belles’s, nobody missed: that of the star-crossed Medina Spirit. These two champions born over a decade apart have much in common. Both stars of America’s most famous race died during the exorbitant physical stress of performance and both were just three years old. Despite the years between their respective deaths, both horses also sparked a reckoning of the sport’s ethics and integrity. What clearly has not changed is horses routinely dying from catastrophic cardiac episodes and broken limbs while in the throes of racing and training. It is no less common occurrence now than in 2008. For a sport chock full of folks so adept at finding patterns, I would hope they might see one here. More importantly that they’d admit it. So continue to question the practice of horse racing we must. In the theatre of public opinion, a respectable future for the sport is a long shot. Racing can scarcely wade its way through one scandal before another is upon it. After the suspect death of Medina Spirit in December there was the tragic story of five-year-old Creative Plan in February, for which no one will be held accountable. Same for the bizarre injustice that befell eight-year-old stallion Laoban at upscale WinStar Farm. There are the unknowns like 23-year-old mare Keepthename, who in her youth had been sold for $250,000 and trained by Hall of Fame trainer Steve Asmussen in the early 2000s before being dispensed to a life of breeding. The sleek gorgeous chestnut mare with the wineglass marking on her nose produced 12 foals over 17 years. She was a warrior. Then just weeks ago in early April, Thoroughbred Athletes, Inc, a thoroughbred rescue based in Oklahoma, identified her in the slaughter pipeline. She was grimy and emaciated with a crushed skull. Her head hung low in pain and despair. She was a sight of the absolute worst neglect imaginable. The rescue fundraised to buy her out of the “killpen” and promptly had her humanely euthanized. A raging infection was so established throughout her head she would have required extensive surgery which she likely would not have survived. Keepthename’s former trainer, Asmussen, oversees the the second favorite in Saturday’s Kentucky Derby, a stunning colt named Epicenter. In a strange twist, another famous Asmussen trainee, Midnight Bourbon, who ran fifth in last year’s Derby, died just days ago. Not far from the hubbub at Churchill Downs, he fell ill suddenly from supposed gastrointestinal distress after a morning workout and was dead within an hour. It took the barn three days to publicly announce his passing. The ghosts of so many horses wander those grounds. One might almost admire the caginess the racing industry has employed with its scattershot structuring in its efforts to maintain distance from horses it no longer profits off. There is no lifelong tracking system for the thoroughbreds the industry creates and verifies through its breeding registry known as The Jockey Club. The industry can create as many horses as it likes, profit off them in racing and breeding, and then claim no liability for what happens to them after they exit the business. Horses leave tracks and are bought and sold infinite times into unknown situations, and they are entirely on their own in the world. In the case of Keepthename, despite more than $60,000 in earnings from just her racing efforts alone, not Asmussen, not her breeder Mocking Bird Farm, Inc, nor any of her known connections or the tracks she ran at, nor those who owned her along the way, nor the racing industry in any capacity whatsoever, had an enforceable responsibility to her in the end. It is the exact path thousands of ex-racehorses find themselves on, disappearing into obscurity, and for many that path ends with their demise. As was the case for poor Keepthename. There has never been an evolution of the industry’s business model with the best interest of the horses as the top priority. Often instead of listening, racing aficionados blow off the concerns of animal rights activists and of the larger public whilst continuing to fail at protecting horses. The unspoken truth is there will never be that awakening, that moment when suddenly the equation makes sense and the solution is clear. The problems with equine welfare in racing are systemic and baked into the very way horses are approached in the sport. To truly act in the best interest of the horses would require a profound ideological reckoning on the macro business and industry level, as well as within the minds of horsewomen and men. Horse racing should decide if the horses matter enough to take some complicated, expensive and untraditional steps to protect them. Ideally this would look like a near complete restructuring from top to bottom that prioritizes the horses at every level of decision making. From the breeding shed to aftercare, from caps on the number of times a horse can be run, its number of years of service, to integrating a more natural and equine friendly lifestyle for racehorses. In this and only this, there is hope. Additionally, there must be a hardline apparatus that divvies out severe and lasting punishments to those who violate horses. This may perhaps save lives. If you can witness a young horse die catastrophically in a race or in training and move on from it with no more than a pang of remorse, you are a detriment to racehorses. If you can publicly mourn the death of a horse who ran notably but ignore altogether the death of a horse who did not, you are a detriment to racehorses. It is a normal response for the violent death of an innocent animal to impact a person in such a way as to make them turn away. If you can repeatedly witness horses die and continue to engage with “the game” then it is not the public, or the animal rights activists, who don’t understand, but you who has been desensitized. I speak from personal experience. To be fair, over recent years racing has taken some commendable actions to improve safety for horses. These efforts have borne some success, though to what degree is difficult to scale because the sport has been contracting for a long time and fewer horses are setting foot on tracks than 20 or 30 years ago. The best that can be said is that racing may be able to make itself safer for horses, but never safe. Having endured countless existential crises, perhaps now is the true do or die moment. If horse racing as an industry chooses to acknowledge reality, the most honorable next step is to be publicly honest: horse racing kills horses. The sport you love and live by kills horses. The sport can start but addressing its lack of an adequately funded industry-sponsored wraparound aftercare solution for all horses leaving the track. In some places like Louisiana, ex-racehorses hemorrhage into the slaughter pipeline. They are given a Facebook post and a short window of opportunity to be “bailed” before shipping off to slaughter in Mexico or Canada. These places charge arbitrary, sometimes outrageous ransoms in exchange for the horse’s freedom. It is hell for the horses in the purest sense of the word. If not for the handful of independent nonprofit rescues and individuals who network, fundraise and work tirelessly to save these thoroughbreds, many would face horrific endings. Right now, donations by industry folks and gamblers are essential on behalf of the horses. But they do not cancel out participation in the ongoing, often deadly, exploitation of younger running horses who will one day rely on those donations too. All while a fresh crop of new foals blinks into the sunlight. Thoroughbred rescues shake their tin cups while Churchill Downs announces a project that allocates $200m to refurbish the track’s paddock area. The gross display of wealth also plays out at industry sales, where two-year-old racehorses are pushed to run in blistering fractions at previews for wealthy buyers. One colt recently purchased by Zedan Racing Stables, the owners of the late Medina Spirit, went for a gobsmacking $2.3m and he wasn’t the only horse to sell in the millions at that single Ocala, Florida, sale. The imbalance is satirical. If racing hopes to help itself in the greater picture of its future, now is the time it might tackle the question of how it will fare in a modern society, culture, and potentially a justice system that increasingly recognizes animals as entitled to certain fundamental rights. The least of those being survival of the for-profit business which created them. After that, all racehorses are entitled to a safe and financially secure future. These things were stolen from Eight Belles, Medina Spirit, Keepthename, Creative Plan, Laoban and thousands of unknown others. Let them not be also taken from the young horses to come.

5/5/2022,"A serving SAS soldier has denied in court that emails between him and Ben Roberts-Smith – including marked-up pictures of a compound in Afghanistan – demonstrated they had colluded on their evidence about a mission, during which the newspaper defendants allege two civilians were murdered. The soldier, anonymised in the federal court as Person 29, is a former comrade of Roberts-Smith and the godfather to one of his children. Under cross-examination by lawyers for the newspapers on Thursday, Person 29 rejected assertions the pair had collaborated to ensure their stories about the mission aligned. Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. The 2009 SAS raid on a compound known as Whiskey 108 in the village of Kakarak – an insurgent redoubt in Afghanistan’s southern Uruzgan province, has emerged as one of the most critical, and fiercely contested, elements of this trial. The newspapers allege two men – one with a prosthetic leg and the other an elderly man – were discovered hiding in a tunnel in the compound and were taken into custody by the Australian soldiers before being murdered. The man with the prosthetic leg was allegedly machine-gunned by Roberts-Smith outside the compound, with his leg later taken as a war trophy by another soldier and used as a drinking vessel for celebrating troops. The other man was allegedly executed by a junior soldier on Roberts-Smith’s orders – a “blooding” of a new trooper. Roberts-Smith and three soldier witnesses, who have appeared in this trial on his behalf, have dismissed that version of events as impossible, saying no people were found inside the tunnel. Five other Australian SAS soldiers subpoenaed by the newspapers have told the court two men were found hiding in the makeshift tunnel. Under cross-examination by Nicholas Owens SC, acting for the newspapers, Person 29 was shown an email sent to him by Roberts-Smith in July 2019, days before his outline of evidence was filed to the court. Attached to the email was an image of Whiskey 108 marked with blue pen. A blue box drawn on the picture, Owens said, marked where an insurgent would be said to have been shot by Roberts-Smith. Owens put it to Person 29 he was speaking “very regularly” to Roberts-Smith in the lead up to filing his outline of evidence, and discussing Whiskey 108 so their stories would align. “I can’t say we were talking regularly … but the Whiskey 108 mission would have been a topic of conversation,” Person 29 replied, but denied any collusion. Owens asked: “I want to put to you again, when you had a conversation with Mr Roberts-Smith about this document, it was for the purpose of aligning your stories about Whiskey 108 in key respects, do you agree?” “No, I don’t agree,” Person 29 replied. Person 29 admitted he had failed to provide the email to the court despite receiving a subpoena calling for all communications between himself and Roberts-Smith relating to Whiskey 108. He said he “habitually” deletes emails. But Owens accused the soldier of deliberately defying the subpoena. Person 29 apologised to the court for not comprehensively searching his computer files for documents relating to the Whiskey 108 mission, insisting his failure to search computer hard drives was not a deliberate attempt to hide information. He conceded he did not search a hard drive that he owned and that he knew contained footage from the deployment that included the Whiskey 108 mission. Owens accused him of withholding a video of Whiskey 108 being bombed, which he knew he possessed, because he did not want the newspapers to have access to it. “I put it to you, you deliberately didn’t search hard drives which you knew might be responsive to that subpoena,” Owens said. “You were seeking to conceal from us information in your possession that might be helpful to us and adverse to Mr Roberts-Smith.” “That’s not correct,” Person 29 said. “As a demonstration of my diligence, I spent numerous hours searching those documents … that I’ve handed over. “If I was remiss to that level, I apologise, and I apologise to the court, but that was certainly not my intent.” Person 29 remains under cross-examination. The trial, before justice Anthony Besanko, continues.",News/Australia news,"SAS soldier denies colluding with Ben Roberts-Smith on evidence, defamation trial hears ",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/05/sas-soldier-denies-colluding-with-ben-roberts-smith-on-evidence-defamation-trial-hears
5/5/2022,"Today is the last time you will go to the polls before the government’s shameful and shameless new elections bill becomes law. It was squeezed through parliament late at night last week in the final “wash-up” of bad bills before the end of the session. The bill’s Trumpish voter suppression is designed to deter poor and young people from voting. Its passing also makes these the last elections to be monitored and scrutinised by a genuinely independent Electoral Commission. This habitually timid outfit tried to stand up for itself: “The independence of the Electoral Commission is vital to the functioning of a healthy democracy,” it said. But, as of now, Boris Johnson and his allies will set their own terms for the commission, including its scrutiny of finance. Every voter will need a photo ID from now on, so 7.5% of voters, or 3.5 million people, without a driving licence or a passport will have to be determined enough to trek to their local council office, have their photo taken and fill out an application with a counter-signature. It’s worth noting that the DVLA and the Passport Office are in crisis: just try booking an urgent passport slot. Anyone looking at our voting patterns would worry about too few people turning out, not people voting twice. The risk of “personation” – cheating on identity – is minuscule: in 2017 there was one conviction, in 2018 none at all. In a grossly unfair and undemocratic electoral system, the probity and honesty of its operation is the one aspect to be proud of. The Tory-led public administration and constitutional affairs committee produced a devastating condemnation of the bill. They estimated 2.3% of voters would be deterred from voting, or 1.1 million people, who would probably be those on low incomes, from ethnic minorities and with disabilities. They warned that too much arbitrary discretion would be left to polling station staff to accept or reject ID, causing queues and rows. If you doubt this is a conspiracy to stop non-Tories voting, look at the only ID that is acceptable beyond passports and driving licences: pensioners will be allowed to use the older person’s bus pass, Oyster 60+ or Senior 60+ SmartPass – while young people will be barred from using their railcards. The government rejected Lord Willetts’ amendment 86 trying to include a wide range of documents for all ages. Older people are the main users of postal votes – which won’t require ID. All this is surely not unconnected with the Tories’ 47-point lead among the over-65s, and Labour’s 43-point lead among under 25s as of 2019. The Spectator has kindly assembled no fewer than 11 writings and sayings by Johnson excoriating ID cards, starting with, “I loathe the idea on principle. I never want to be commanded, by any emanation of the British state, to produce evidence of my identity … I will take that card out of my wallet and physically eat it.” But now ID cards serve his only remaining political purpose: to get re-elected. The bill’s other abomination concerns the relatively new mayoral and police and crime commissioner elections: it sweeps away the present second-preference system in favour of the unfairest of all, the antique first past the post (FPTP). Why? Because Tories are more likely to win under FPTP. There are more anti-Tory progressive voters, who transfer their second preferences to another progressive party, but rarely to a Tory. As Neal Lawson, who advocates a progressive alliance, wrote eloquently this week, a majority-progressive vote is usually disastrously divided. Today, in 82% of elections there will be at least two progressive candidates splitting their vote, standing against just one Conservative, according to Jon Narcross of the Electoral Reform Society. Proportional representation (PR) would, to borrow a phrase, “level up” votes, so they don’t pile up wasted. PR now gets strong public support, according to YouGov, with 44% in favour, and only 27% for first past the post. The last week, with seven front pages of the Mail and others piling in, trying to make Keir Starmer’s beer and curry on the campaign trail as bad as Downing Street’s 12 parties is just another grim reminder of the monstrous heft of the rightwing press, used unscrupulously to save its multimillionaire owners from the perils of Labour in power. Labour, if it becomes the biggest party at the next general election, must lead the way to electoral reform. Labour is highly unlikely to win alone, so this time the Liberal Democrats and all the other parties must demand PR immediately, as its first act or refuse any cooperation on anything else. There is no need for a referendum, just do it. Referendums are toxic politics – and the Tories can hardly complain when they have gerrymandered, prorogued and suppressed opposing votes, their mendacious press claque distorting any fair voice, with total disregard for what is now a broken constitution. Johnson has killed off Peter Hennessy’s theory of a “good chaps” constitution, one in which practitioners hold dear not just the rules themselves but also their spirit. So what should progressive “good chaps”, be they male or female, do at the close of a Johnson era? That much is clear. They should feel free to introduce a voting system that will stop any corrupt party with a minority of votes ever governing alone again with dictatorial powers.

5/5/2022,"As the sun rose over Wiltshire, Hampshire and Gloucestershire in the summer of 1989, farmers discovered that their swaying fields of barley, wheat and oats had been used to host a new phenomenon: crop circles. They reached their apotheosis during those balmy months, thanks to a sudden proliferation and blanket mainstream media coverage, but the narrative was dominated by discussions of possible alien visitation or just the wilful vandalism of it all. At the time, few people thought to judge crop circles on their artistic merit but, three decades on, the time may have come for such a reappraisal. Britain in the 1980s was a country lacking in mystery, magic and enchantment. Then, as now, it was a time of conflict, division and ideological battles – free market v unionised labour; police state v workers – all overseen by the cold pragmatism of the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, as she ruthlessly pursued war on distant soil and the “managed decline” of industries such as coalmining and shipbuilding. From Auf Wiedersehen, Pet to Boys from the Blackstuff and Brideshead Revisited, much of enduring TV drama reflected a politicised country controlled by class, or increasingly obsessed by the financial accumulation of the individual. The seminal Freeze exhibition of 1988 set Damien Hirst on the path to becoming the world’s wealthiest artist, someone defined by price rather than content, and even the decade’s salient moment in pop, Live Aid, was concerned with addressing a byproduct of capitalism: poverty in the developing world. The times they had a-changed. The potency of crop circles lay less in the who and how and more in the why. And the answer seemed to be: just because. These strange flattenings of crops were made simply for spectacle, their anonymous creators’ sole ambition to evoke a sense of awe lacking in British daily life. Their scale was certainly staggering: at their largest, some designs measured 900ft across, almost as long as the Eiffel Tower is tall. If these were intended as art, or regarded as such, no price tag could be attached. Instead, they were a gift to the nation, a series of stunning distractions designed to raise questions rather than offer answers. Aside from a few enterprising farmers and aerial photographers, there was no real profit to be had from crop circles. This, by their very nature, made them anticapitalist, completely at odds with the messages being relayed from the twin powers of Westminster and the City: profit at all costs. It was precisely because their creators were unknown, and their work had no intrinsic economic value, that made their moment in the spotlight an important chapter in the evolution of indigenous British folk art. It is this idea of art for the people – rather than the more mundane practicalities of the endeavour (spoiler: crop circles were made by pranksters using ropes and planks) – that I explore in my new novel, The Perfect Golden Circle, a fictionalised attempt to celebrate the scale of these landscape artworks, and the type of individuals who might visualise them in the first place. The esoteric designs represented freedom, trespass and never asking permission, which is why their makers were highly criticised – even though their respectfully executed nocturnal missions left a farmer’s yield undamaged as the stalks slowly sprang back to their former height. The real winners were the news media, who had a story that could run and run, filling large pages during the fallow summer months. A photograph and a few sentences could make a spread. Nevertheless, the message sent by their makers remained an entirely subversive one. These works asked the crucial question: who really owns the land? My novel frames crop circles within a longstanding tradition of pranksters, peasant revolutionaries and landscape dissidents, such as the 17th-century activist Gerrard Winstanley, who published searing treatises about the question of class and led the dissident Diggers in occupying common land during the time of the enclosures. Winstanley was fighting a reformatory system that led to the carved up country of today in which, according to author Guy Shrubsole in his 2019 book Who Owns England?, half is owned by less than 1% of its population, and 67% is owned by a mixture of aristocrats, corporations, the crown, the church and oligarchs – the last particularly prescient given the role of Russia’s wealthy elite in the rise of Vladimir Putin (and Britain’s complicity in their overseas investments). But we don’t even need to look far into the past to appreciate the importance of crop circles in the summer of 1989, which saw the culmination of several summers of rural unrest. In 1985, Wiltshire police had prevented several hundred people travelling in convoy to Stonehenge; there were beatings and 537 arrests (21 travellers were later awarded compensation for false imprisonment and wrongful arrest). It was one more example of the same heavy-handed police tactics that had defined the miners’ strike and the Wapping disputes of 1986, as well as the part that police ineptitude played during the Hillsborough disaster that April in 1989. The Public Order Act of 1986 had given police greater control over public gatherings, but also resulted in new age travellers squatting at several sites close to Wiltshire’s A303 over subsequent summers. Further police clashes culminated, on 22 June 1989, in 260 arrests of those attempting to celebrate the solstice at Stonehenge (the next spring would also see the poll tax riots, undertaken in the same spirit of revolt against power). It was also the second summer of love, at a time when acid house raves were held, much to the chagrin of the authorities and the outrage of the tabloid press. The parties were merely the modern iteration of various ritualised pagan practices that had been enjoyed for millennia: dancing, revelling, communing. In among the convoys, camper vans and sound systems, the crop circlers covertly went about their business, part of this new age traveller culture, yet unseen and unnamed, always maintaining a code of silence that was mafia-like in its resolve: an omertà of the grassy downs and chalk plains. Theirs was a symbolic act of rebellion against a backdrop of state repression. But the circles themselves also reached a level of artistic purity that was impossible to achieve by artists who enter the commercial marketplace of exhibitions, dealers and collectors. Crop circles could never be commodified but should rightfully be recognised as works of equal value and importance to those created by such British landscape artists as Andy Goldsworthy and Richard Long, whose work utilises natural resources on miniature and epic scale. American sculptor Robert Smithson’s 1,500ft-long earthwork Spiral Jetty, or Agnes Denes’ Wheatfield: A Confrontation, in which two acres of a vacant New York lot were filled with wheat, could also be seen as forerunners to crop circles. Even Banksy, for all his attempts at anonymity, has accumulated great wealth from his public art, whereas crop circlers operated at a deeper level of subterfuge. They bypassed all commercial concerns by making work impossible to either move or monetise. Like a portrait rendered in disappearing ink, their works soon vanished. I have chosen to depict a series of fictionalised crop circles and the two characters who make them: a taciturn Falklands veteran recovering from injury and trauma, and a semi-feral punk with an innate ability to design increasingly intricate patterns. “Patterns” is a preferable term here, as “circles” does a disservice to the more ambitious creations that incorporated such design features as locks, clock parts, ribbons, dolphins, whirlpools, mandalas and much more. The novel is written in the spirit of crop circle pioneers such as Doug Bower and Dave Chorley, who came forward in 1991 to dispel the many conspiracy theories when they casually confessed that they had been responsible for making more than 200 circles since 1978 (with another 1,000 or so created by unknown others). The unassuming Englishness of Bower and Chorley, and the modesty of their revelation, made them even more heroic to many. They didn’t need to point out that the many crackpots theorists, cereologists (experts on the paranormal explanation for crop circles), frothing journalists and random tinfoil hat-wearing oddballs attracted to the fields of Wiltshire were just wrong. They were simply artists, operating on a different literal plane. Today we should salute them and their valuable work, and say their names alongside those of English greats such as Blake and Bacon, Constable and Turner, Moore and Hepworth.

5/5/2022,"Bubbling away in the background this offseason are Lamar Jackson’s protracted contract negotiations with the Ravens. Jackson has still not signed a long-term deal. While the Ravens’ AFC rivals have locked their young quarterbacks into record-shattering extensions, Jackson has continued to run his contract down. The former MVP is set to play out the 2022 season on the final year of his rookie deal. The Ravens remain confident they can get a deal done prior to the season – a deal that Jackson is negotiating himself without an agent. But that was before they traded away Jackson’s running mate, receiver Hollywood Brown. And with each passing week that the two sides do not reach a compromise, the more likely it is that Jackson could play elsewhere in 2023. Jackson is reported to be looking for a deal that would guarantee him $45m per season. The Deshaun Watson contract in Cleveland looms large, too. Watson signed a fully guaranteed deal with the Browns, and it’s likely that Jackson wants a deal with a similar structure – a fully guaranteed contract that will allow him to re-enter free agency before he hits 30. The Ravens may be queasy about ponying up $250m in guaranteed money for a quarterback whose ability to run leaves him more vulnerable to injury. Yet given the shift across the sport (and sports in general) towards player (read: quarterback) empowerment, the decision is most likely out of the Ravens’ hands anyway. Does Jackson want to stay in Baltimore long-term? Would he prefer to move back home to Miami? The quarterback-franchise relationship is increasingly taking on the role of a partnership rather than the top-down employer-to-employee dynamic. The Arizona Cardinals essentially overpaid to acquire Brown from Baltimore in order to appease their own disgruntled quarterback, Kyler Murray. The Ravens can threaten Jackson with the franchise tag; Jackson can threaten to sit out a year. It’s not too difficult to imagine a world in which Jackson is moved to another team next offseason in a tag-and-trade, with the quarterback then signing a record-breaking deal with a new franchise. You can bundle these two franchises together. Both are following a similar plan: Loading up on talent for the upcoming season while also adding a hefty insurance policy for 2023. The Dolphins shipped the bulk of their 2022 draft class in order to acquire Tyreek Hill. Meanwhile, on draft night Howie Roseman and the Eagles’ brain-trust followed suit, turning one of their first-round picks into AJ Brown. The plan is clear. The Dolphins and Eagles are handing starting quarterbacks Tua Tagovailoa and Jalen Hurts the tools to succeed – all while gathering acorns if their quarterback fails to impress with an improved supporting cast. The Dolphins spent heavily in the offseason to hand Tagovailoa as much offensive firepower as possible. They also have the facility to open cap room next offseason, and will be armed with two first-round picks heading into the 2023 draft. Ditto for the Eagles, who have the ability to open up $30m in cap room before they look at restructuring contracts. It’s one of the new models of team building: Surrounding a young quarterback with as much help as possible as early as possible to figure out as quickly as possible whether they can play or not, while gathering future assets to allow the franchise to acquire another quarterback if things don’t pan out. That could mean tempting a veteran to Miami or Philly – the kind of logic the Bucs used to woo Tom Brady in free agency – or using a pile of draft picks to move up in the draft to select their college prospect of choice. The Jets have done everything to surround second-year quarterback Zach Wilson with as much talent as possible over the offseason. They’ve added playmakers at receiver and running back, beefed up their offensive line, and brought in a pair of versatile tight ends who will allow them to diversify what was a plodding offense a year ago. And they could add even more over the coming weeks. If Deebo Samuel pushes through a trade away from the 49ers, the price tag will now be built around 2023 draft choices. The Jets reportedly chased a Samuel trade right up until they selected Ohio State receiver Garrett Wilson 10th overall last Thursday. If Samuel is on the move, it stands to reason that the Jets will be in on any discussions. General manager Joe Douglas could have done little more – aside from possibly strengthening the offensive line in the draft – to put Wilson in a better position to make a second-year leap. And yet the deck is still stacked against the quarterback heading into his sophomore year. Here is a list of the quarterbacks who have had a lower adjusted net yards per attempt in a season than Wilson had in 2021: Josh Rosen, Brett Hundley, DeShone Kizer, Jared Goff, Blake Bortles, Blaine Gabbert and Jimmy Clausen. Gulp. The evaluation clock for young quarterbacks is now sped up to the extent that if Wilson doesn’t show considerable improvement in his second year, the Jets will start considering alternatives. You have to hand it to Titans GM Jon Robinson and head coach Mike Vrabel. They locked up their new contracts and then used that leverage to take some major swings in the draft: Trading AJ Brown and then betting all on athletic upside with their selections. The most interesting pick: Grabbing Liberty quarterback Malik Willis in the third round. Throughout the pre-draft process Willis was in the discussion as a first-round pick, with some projections slating him to go sixth overall to the Carolina Panthers. Instead, he slipped into the third round, where the Titans were able to take a punt on a raw quarterback prospect with a rare skill-set. The timeline appears to marry up perfectly for Tennessee. To draft Willis is to open up the possibility a wholesale reshuffling of a roster and its offensive (cliché warning) identity. The system the Titans run with the axis of Ryan Tannehill and Derrick Henry will be markedly different when – or if – Willis takes over the starting spot. Tannehill’s contract has an easy out for the Titans after the 2022 season. If the franchise believes Willis is ready, it can move on from the Tannehill pain-free. If a team isn’t sure it has a franchise quarterback, the best thing it can do is throw as many darts at the dartboard as possible. Now, Tannehill has one final year to prove he can be the quarterback who pushes Tennessee over the postseason hump. If not, waiting in the wings is a player with game-breaking potential. The timeline suggests that will come after the season. But if Tannehill falters and Willis absorbs NFL concepts in double-time, the Titans could make a change mid-year in order to spark their season. The Falcons will feature one of the league’s true quarterback competitions this preseason. Marcus Mariota was brought in during free agency to be a stabilizing force between the Matt Ryan era and whatever comes next. That new era could belong to Desmond Ridder. Landing Ridder in the third round represented great value. Maybe it works out for him long-term. Maybe it doesn’t. Either way, it was worth the directionless Falcons taking a punt on a mid-round quarterback prospect – particularly one who was expected to go at the foot of the first round. Ridder has a shot to play in week one. His game is built around speed: Processing speed, and then the ability to break the pocket as a runner – a skill not fully maximized in college. In many ways, Ridder’s traits echo Mariota’s, which will allow coach Arthur Smith to build a cohesive structure if he opts to move from one quarterback to the other. The Falcons will probably have another losing season in 2022, but with a combination of Mariota and Ridder, tight end Kyle Pitts, first-round pick Drake London, and Cordarrelle Patterson, the offense should at least be fun.",Sport/Sport,QB offseason storylines: Lamar Jackson uncertainty and Zach Wilson in the spotlight,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/05/quarterbacks-nfl-lamar-jackson-ravens-contract-zach-wilson-jets
5/5/2022,"A painting by Egon Schiele depicting the artist’s uncle and legal guardian has been rediscovered after being missing for more than 90 years, a museum has said. Leopold Czihaczek at the Piano (1907) was found within a Viennese private collection and will go on public display for the first time at the Leopold Museum in Austria, which houses the largest and most eminent collection of works by the great expressionist. The piece will be a part of the museum’s non-fungible tokens (NFT) collection of 24 paintings and drawings by Schiele, produced in partnership with LaCollection – a new NFT platform dedicated to museum collections. Funds from the NFT collection will go towards the painting’s restoration and expansion of the museum’s Schiele collection. Recognised as one of the most formative and colourful figures of Viennese modernism, Schiele managed to create a groundbreaking body of work before his death from flu at the age of 28 during the 1918 pandemic. The Leopold Museum’s founder, Rudolf Leopold, was one of the most important patrons of Schiele’s work and is credited with being largely responsible for his fame. Leopold Czihaczek at the Piano was painted shortly before Schiele’s 17th birthday. It is impressionist in style, with a muted palette characteristic of his early work. Czihaczek became Schiele’s legal guardian after the death of Schiele’s father when the artist was 15. He is depicted in the painting as a bourgeois figure and man of culture – an ode to the role he was to play in the young artist’s life. Verena Gamper from the Leopold Museum Research Center said: “The painting shows Egon Schiele’s uncle and legal guardian, Leopold Czihaczek (1842-1929), playing the piano in his apartment in Vienna’s Leopoldstadt district. “Following the untimely death of Egon’s father, Adolf Schiele, Czihaczek had assumed Schiele’s guardianship.” The last record of Leopold Czihaczek at the Piano can be traced to Rudolf Leopold’s 1972 catalogue raisonné of the artist. According to Gamper, it was previously only known from preliminary studies and a black and white photograph from 1930 showing a room in which it hung. “Since then, there was no evidence if the painting still existed or if it had been permanently lost,” she said. “It was such a thrilling moment seeing this poorly documented and presumably untraceable work materialise, when the owners of the painting contacted us and I realised what kind of treasure they were talking about.” The NFT collection will reflect subjects at the heart of Schiele’s work that continue to resonate today, including gender and androgyny, self-identity and psychological struggle. “As one of the most revered but controversial modern painters for the disturbing intensity and raw sexuality of his painting, the NFTs provide an opportunity to collect works that elicited a strong visceral reaction in viewers when first shown in 1906,” the museum said. NFTs – unique digital assets stored on a blockchain – have gripped the arts sector since the digital artist Mike Winkelmann, better known as Beeple, made history last year by selling an NFT for $69.4m. Hans-Peter Wipplinger, the director of the Leopold Museum, said: “Leopold Czihaczek at the Piano is a masterpiece of Schiele’s early work … The current owners have agreed to place the painting at the disposal of the Leopold Museum as a permanent loan. “Following its cleaning and restoration, we will have the chance to make it accessible to the public as part of our permanent presentation on Vienna 1900 and within the museum’s unique collection of paintings and drawings by Schiele.”",Arts/Art and design,Egon Schiele painting of his uncle rediscovered after over 90 years,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/05/egon-schiele-painting-uncle-rediscovered-90-years
