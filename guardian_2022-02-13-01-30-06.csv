There were still nearly a dozen runners within a couple of lengths of the lead as the field went over the second last, but Glory And Fortune had carved out a length advantage by the final flight and stayed on to win by a short head as I Like To Move It inched ever closer on the run to the line.  “I couldn’t figure out why he was the price he was,” Sheppard said. “He beat Soaring Glory at level weights [when they were second and third] in the Christmas Hurdle at Kempton and we were getting weight off him today.” Eldorado Allen stayed on well on his first attempt at three miles to win the Grade Two Denman Chase, beating Royale Pagaille and Clan Des Obeaux by two-and-a-quarter lengths and 10 after making most of the running.

2/13/2022,"Former chief of Nottinghamshire police, who called out the “toxic culture of sexism” in UK policing“The home secretary needs to announce a proper public inquiry into policing, as opposed to a localised look at the Metropolitan police that has no statutory obligations.  Second, policing needs to decide what it wants from its officers in the 21st century. At the moment, the recruitment, selection and promotion processes confirm all the traits that we don’t want to see in policing. One of the key characteristics for not being corrupt is conscientiousness, or diligence, along with high levels of empathy. Those traits correlate to what might be described as decent people. Yet those virtues are never even considered or measured at any point in an officer’s career. Currently professional competence trumps everything else, particularly on technical skills such as firearms. We need to look at what’s rewarded and recognised. At the moment, those who might have had the courage or the desperateness to actually complain about other people are the ones who get sidelined, victimised and penalised. Not the perpetrators. We also need to totally change the code of conduct. It needs to be modern and needs to be absolutely explicit when people flagrantly abuse their positions of power. And we almost need a cull of people from policing whose values don’t fit. To find them you could carry out a cultural audit, identify what are good and what are negative behaviours and then start to call them out. The result is that as soon as you join a shift as a man, you’re not automatically enrolled in the WhatsApp group that shows pornography. I think it would move us much more to a service rather than a force position. And, finally, it’s not just the Met – the issues are much wider than that.” Member of the London assembly’s police and crime committee“First, the Met needs to accept it has a problem. Then it needs to set up a detailed action plan with firm timescales when to deliver. We cannot wait for a review [announced by Cressida Dick less than a week before her resignation] that will take a year, maybe two years. Fundamentally, the Met also needs the will to undergo root and branch reform. It is a shame because Cressida had the potential to be one of the all-time great reforming commissioners. But she needed to stop being defensive, to take a step back. Instead of immediately dismissing there was a problem, to accept it. Look at the history of corruption and failures and surely the starting point should have been to accept the evidence. You cannot address an issue if you don’t accept there’s a problem. We also need to look at recruitment in the context of recruitment not being enough if you don’t retain people. The Met has a terrible history of not retaining new officers, women officers – we’re losing all that experience. And we need to look at training for operational practices and the continuous review of section 50 procedures [the right of officers to obtain a person’s name and address], training, along with creating genuine engagement community. Also the messaging from the Met is a mess. I’ve said this to Cress [Cressida] myself, told her that the use of social media is not good. In short, the way forward for the Met is to accept it has issues, to stop being defensive, be bold and go out and take people with it, policing with consent.” One of the first Asian women to climb the ranks of the Met, becoming detective superintendent. She left in 2019“The Met needs to immediately focus on providing safe spaces for women and people of colour so they can speak out. It needs to introduce ‘speak out’ groups, creating a platform for people to feel secure when they say what’s on their mind, what’s bothering them. It also needs to make sure that when people do call out bad behaviour, instead of their line manager reporting the complaint to a senior officer - who tend to accept on face value whatever they are told without talking to the complainant – that the person who has complained gives their own account. That’s where the breakdown is. It’s about making sure that you provide opportunities for people to complain. People might not necessarily want to speak out, but if you’ve got a group of people saying these are the issues, then they know it’s a problem. And just because a lot of these [toxic] groups will get disbanded or get deleted doesn’t mean to say that those people are going to stop behaving in a bad way. They’ll do it in a more covert way, which is exactly what happened with the race issues and promotion opportunities – development opportunities. Women and minorities were disregarded and isolated. I’ve had so many people approach me to say they’re not being supported, they’ve been stopped at the first hurdle when going for a job. For instance, they were going to publish a race review last year, but they still haven’t done it. As for Cressida, it shows the importance of leadership. Defending your cops is brilliant but you cannot defend the indefensible.” Former chief superintendent in the Met“The first thing the Met needs to do is acknowledge its shortcomings, something Dick refused to do. Then it must start the process of beginning to listen to advisory groups, viewing feedback as a gift and not as a personal attack. The problem became such that it was not just my Asian and Black friends who expressed concern in the Metropolitan police but middle- aged white women and men who joined the chorus for a fundamental rethink in how the force reconnects with Londoners and the most diverse capital in the world. The litany of failings, the cases of racism and bullying, took me back to my first day in policing. I remember walking into Tottenham police station in 1983 and the hostility towards me from my colleagues. I could count on one hand the officers who did not use the P and N racial slurs. Fast-forward to 2022 and ask: what change has happened ? Back then, I was told it would take a few decades for the Met to change. Yet four decades on and change hasn’t happened. Cressida Dick has been at the helm for five years – that’s plenty of time to make changes but she has failed at so many levels. I have no idea what her vision even was and allied to the extensive list of failures on her watch, including the optics of corruption that infected the investigation into the death of the private investigator Daniel Morgan, where Dick was personally cited. I think the removal of Cressida Dick was right and I hope the successor will have a vision and introduce change.” Criminologist who has worked with police forces to tackle misogyny“We would do well to remember the Peelian principle from the founder of the Met, namely: ‘The police are the public and the public are the police.’ While effective leadership, including drives to recruit and promote women and ethnic minorities, is essential, it is difficult to achieve when trust is eroded, and these things in themselves are not a panacea for change. https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/11/how-cressida-dick-support-as-met-chief-unravelled There must be a real commitment to finally root out institutional racism and misogyny and publicly acknowledge the role of police culture in sustaining it. To achieve this, an urgent priority is to upscale public input, including reframing of what ‘policing success’ looks like, reshaping priorities, evaluating investigation and prosecution practices and, most importantly, holding the police to account. A new code of policing should be drawn up with independent oversight of disciplinary procedures and swift removal of those who flagrantly breach it. The accountability of MPs to the public must also be strengthened. The public should not have to wait for resignations and votes of no confidence from those within the policing and political parties. Accountability to the public they supposedly serve is long overdue. The public deserve more than police officers and MPs who abuse theiroffice by holding them in contempt. ‘Why did it take so long?’ was one of the news headlines after the resignation of Cressida Dick. Why indeed?”",News/UK news,Can the Metropolitan police change after Cressida Dick’s resignation?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/12/metropolitan-police-change-cressida-dick-resignation-commissioner-policing-scandal
2/13/2022,"Dr Julie Smith, 37, is a clinical psychologist who has a private practice in Hampshire and has spent 10 years working for the NHS. In November 2019, she started making TikToks containing clear, engaging advice about various mental health issues. She has more than 3 million followers and in January published her first book, Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before?, which has spent four weeks at the top of bestseller lists. There are a lot of self-help books published; why do you think yours has struck a chord?I think people like the fact that it’s evidence-based. I’m a clinical psychologist, so the things I’ve put in there have been scrutinised with the latest research and they are things that are taught to people in therapy, depending on what they’re going to therapy for. They are also life skills that we can all use.  Everyone’s had days when their mood is lower than they would like it to be or days when they’re dealing with more stress, grief, or anxiety – all those normal human feelings that can hold us back or be a struggle to cope with if we don’t have the right skills. Also we’ve just come through a pandemic and I think lots of people are thinking: “How can I pull myself through this?” How did you segue into social media and TikTok?When I was offering psychological therapies, I found a lot of people didn’t realise that a part of therapy is educational. You do a lot of talking and working out your problems, but you also learn a little bit about how your mind works, how you can influence your mood and your emotional state and how then you can affect your day-to-day mental health. People found that educational aspect so empowering that there was a shift in their ability to manage their mental health day to day. So I would come home and harp on to my husband about how this stuff should be more available, that people shouldn’t have to come to me to find out the basics, and he said: “Well, go on then, make it available. Put it on YouTube or something.” Giving people tools – that’s cognitive behavioural therapy isn’t it?There’s a mix in there. I’ve tried to keep it to everyday tools. I’ve been very careful about that distinction: “This is the educational element of therapy, it’s not therapy.” These are tools that you can put into use today and tomorrow, but the book’s not a therapist. Social media is often blamed for young people’s mental health problems, especially self-esteem and anxiety…A portion of my videos have been about trying to remind people that what they see on social media isn’t always real. To be mindful when they’re spending time with certain content of how it makes them feel and to use social media to enhance their life rather than take away from it. Social media behaviour such as ghosting, trolling or blocking can be distressing. What advice do you give people who find being online quite brutal?It’s about recognising that you have the power of choice. You have a choice how long you spend online, you have a choice about who you follow and who you don’t and the content you engage in. When you get into mindless scrolling, it can feel like you don’t have a choice. So my videos have really been about reminding people and helping them to build that awareness – that if this is impacting you in a negative way, you are one decision away from something different. There’s a line that often circulates that gen Z and millennials are more prone to mental health problems, that they’re snowflakes basically. What would you say about that?It’s not something I would engage with at all. Mental health is, for me, no different to physical health. No one is immune. If you take anyone and you start messing around with their core defences, things such as sleep, routine, social connection, nutrition and exercise, then that person will become vulnerable to both physical and mental health problems. I think more people are starting to realise that now and that’s helping to tackle the stigma around mental health. It’s a much healthier way to view things. So people are just better at naming things nowadays, rather than actually being more fragile?You are not more physically fragile for talking about your physical injuries. There aren’t more broken legs just because we plaster them up now. It’s moving in the right direction, but you’ll always get some kickback, that’s how change happens. “Metacognition” is key concept in your book; why is it important?It is kind of thoughts about your thoughts. It’s one of the main tools that we utilise in therapy – being able to step back from your thought processes and observe them. By doing that, you get to see them for what they are. People often think therapy is about changing your thoughts. Actually, you can’t decide what thoughts are going to pop into your head – it just happens. The bit you get to choose is how much air time you give each thought. You seem to be quite down on positive thinking. Is positive thinking a bad thing?Positive thoughts are great, they’re not bad. But there is this sort of movement online around only positive vibes; don’t allow the negative thoughts to be there. If you have that standard for yourself, as soon as negative thoughts start to appear that you can’t control, you start to feel like you’re failing or that you’re not positive enough. That you’re not enough in general. It sets you up to feel worse. So therapy is often about accepting thoughts as they arrive and then making choices about what you do with them. If I spend time with these thoughts, is that going to help me move forward where I want to go? Or if I spend time with these, what impact is that having that’s different? It’s allowing your brain to come up with whatever it comes up with and then choosing what to do next. There’s a chapter in your book titled “How do you make yourself do something when you don’t feel like it?”. We’ve all been there. What’s the answer?There are always things that we don’t feel like doing. There’s something that’s taught in a therapy called dialectical behaviour therapy, DBT for short, which is opposite action. Mindfulness is a really helpful element of this, where you become aware of the urges to act. So each feeling will give you an urge to do or not do something. And often you’ll feel the feeling and you’ll go and do the thing and you haven’t really separated out the urge and the action – you just do it all in one go. But what you can do is begin to build awareness of an urge and start to recognise that you don’t have to act on it: you can act opposite to it. This becomes a tool that you can use in those little moments that seem insignificant, but actually add up. How do you think your content might change as we (hopefully) leave the pandemic behind?I don’t imagine for a minute that because the lockdowns have ended the psychological fallout will. People are dealing with huge amounts of loss. Not only where people have lost family members and friends, but also where they’ve lost livelihoods, jobs, financial security, homes, a sense of safety going out. There are huge amounts of changes that will continue for people. The cost of therapy puts it beyond the reach of most people and there’s limited availability on the NHS. How do you square this with the increased number of people who are coming forward?That’s partly why the book felt such a timely thing to do. I can’t give everybody one-to-one therapy, but I can do something. I can share some basic education as widely as I can. I had no interest in being a public person or being on social media – it was really about sharing that information. And it was difficult to do. I’ve got three children and a job and the thing that kept me going was the feedback. It’s just been overwhelming. Every day, people message saying: “Thank you so much. This is making a difference.” It’s not an ideal world and I don’t have all the answers, but I can put my bit in.

2/13/2022,"Adeadly virus arrives from the east and sweeps through western Europe for two years. The pandemic devastates the country’s economy and drastically reduces the number of available workers. Those who survive find they are in a strong position to secure a higher price for their labour. That was the England of the 1350s in the aftermath of the Black Death, when emergency measures were brought in to cope with labour shortages. And, while the death toll from Covid-19 is nowhere near as severe as the drop – of at least a third – in England’s population between 1348 and 1350, the outcome for today’s economy is in some ways similar.  This week’s UK labour market figures are expected to show job vacancies running hot. Vacancies have scaled record highs in recent months and fears that the end of the furlough scheme would lead to a sharp increase in unemployment have proved unfounded. The story behind the official data is of employers struggling to attract or retain staff, and of workers seeking to make the most of it. Those who want to continue working from home part of the time or cut down to a four-day week have found employers more receptive than in the past. “Employers are working hard to keep staff happy,” says Jon Boys, labour market economist at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. “They are trying to look after their staff and do more for them. A year ago we were worried there would be not enough jobs and too many candidates for them. Now we are worried that there are too many jobs and not enough candidates.” During the early part of the pandemic, in 2020, there were four unemployed people for every vacancy in the UK. Now the ratio is one for one. “There aren’t many candidates out there”, Boys says. Economists say the explanation for the current strength of the labour market is simple: demand for workers has been going up at a time when their supply has been limited. On the demand side, the reopening of the economy as the pandemic loosens its grip has meant stronger competition for staff. On the supply side, a combination of factors means the labour force is smaller than it was expected to be pre-Covid. Stephen Evans, chief executive of thinktank the Learning and Work Institute, says there are 1.1 million fewer people in the workforce than there would have been had pre-pandemic trends continued. A third of that is because the population is smaller, as more people have left the UK and fewer people are coming in. This has exacerbated employment pinch points in sectors such as hospitality. Another reason for the drop is that young people are spending longer in education. The biggest cause of the drop, however, is older workers – those aged 50 and over – leaving the workforce altogether. Support for this group – to encourage them to continue looking for work – has not been good enough, Evans says. “The end of the furlough is agreed to have been a triumph,” he says. “The soft landing is great news for those in employment. But there was no attempt to talk to people who were dropping out of the workforce altogether, and no retraining.” Evans argues that more needs to be done to tackle Britain’s chronic skills deficit, noting that while the government is increasing spending on adult skills, it will still be investing less in 2025 than it was in 2010. Over that period, the number of adults improving their skills has dropped by 800,000: against that backdrop, he says, the target set out in the recently published levelling up white paper – to increase that number by 200,000 by 2030 – is not nearly ambitious enough. About 9 million adults in the UK have low literacy or numeracy skills – they aren’t able to understand the dosage levels on a packet of painkillers, for example – and the total has barely shifted over the past 20 years. Andy Briggs, chief executive of Phoenix Group, is the government’s business champion for older workers. “I would say the government has a strong focus on this and is doing a lot of the right things,” he says, though he admits that more could be done. However, employers must also take responsibility for doing more to attract and retain older staff. “It’s absolutely critical. There are massive benefits to this,” says Briggs. As the head of Britain’s biggest long-term savings and retirement firm, which has assets of more than £300bn, he says it makes business sense to employ an age-diverse workforce. “Some older workers have chosen not to work. But we estimate that between 750,000 and a million over-50s who aren’t working actually want to. On the other side there are significant workforce shortages in many sectors. So the solution is for more employers to think about their approach to recruitment and training, and to think differently about attracting over-50s, who have an awful lot of transferable skills.” According to official figures, the employment rate for 50-64-year-olds has dropped by almost 2 percentage points to 70.8% since Covid-19 hit, reversing a global megatrend for more older people to join or stay in the workforce. Even the 2008 financial crisis barely affected this trend. Kirstie Donnelly, chief executive of City & Guilds, the body that has worked on skills delivery for 143 years, says vacancies are spread across most sectors of the economy: 42,000 in construction, 60,000 in transport, 170,000 in food and accommodation, and 200,000 in care. “There are jobs without people and people who don’t want the jobs”, she says. So what happens next? Boys at the CIPD doesn’t believe in the Great Resignation – the idea that the pandemic made people more likely to leave their job and start a completely new career. Although it is counterintuitive, he says, people tend to look to move when unemployment is high rather than when it is low. Boys says this is because when jobs are hard to come by, people can find themselves doing work that doesn’t match their skills or aspirations. In periods of low unemployment, people are more likely people to have found jobs that suit them. The Bank of England expects unemployment to continue falling in the very short term, to 3.8% in the first quarter of 2022. After that, though, it is forecasting a rise in the jobless rate, to a peak of 5%, as the cost of living crisis bites. Tony Wilson, director of thinktank the Institute of Employment Studies, agrees that the labour market will eventually cool. “Firms are under big pressure to raise wages, and most will want to do so, but it will be at the expense of jobs unless they can get some gains through productivity. National insurance is going up, wages are going up, and so firms will increase working hours and won’t replace workers who leave as quickly.” But long-term problems are likely to persist. Research by City & Guilds suggests there will be 3.1 million key worker openings in the next five years, but only around a quarter of UK citizens would consider taking up jobs in sectors such as food production or logistics. Low pay is one factor deterring them; lack of relevant skills, experience or qualifications is another. “In the face of a growing labour crisis impacting these vital industries and wider society, we need to collectively take a long, hard look at how we can make these jobs more attractive”, Donnelly says. “We need to do more than simply clap for carers. We desperately need to re-evaluate the way we as a nation recognise these roles.” In the 14th century, coercion was used in an attempt to increase the supply of labour. In 1351, the Statute of Labourers decreed that all able-bodied men had to work at pre-Black Death wage rates. Such meddling with market forces proved a flop. Today’s experts say a different approach is needed this time.",News/Business,"It’s not quite the Black Death, but worker shortage hits UK firms hard",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/12/its-not-quite-the-black-death-but-worker-shortage-hits-uk-firms-hard
2/13/2022,"In his long career, Louis Hayes has been the drummer of choice for Oscar Peterson, Cannonball Adderley and Horace Silver, to name but three, and has led many of his own bands. Although not one of your flashy, upfront drummers, he has an unmistakable style: excitement tempered by poise. His latest band is a quintet, its members drawn from the current New York jazz scene. The slightly gruff sound of Abraham Burton’s tenor saxophone and the ringing tones of Steve Nelson’s vibraphone make a nice tonal contrast, and they’re both fresh and engaging soloists. Pianist David Hazeltine is best known for his own trio albums (some with Hayes on drums), but he plays his supporting role in the rhythm section immaculately, emerging for the occasional, elegant solo.

2/13/2022,"Istudied engineering at university and, like most of my contemporaries, found that I sometimes needed to write computer programs to do certain kinds of calculations. These pieces of utilitarian software were written in languages now regarded as the programming equivalent of Latin – Fortran, Algol and Pascal – and what I learned from the experience was that I was not a born hacker. The software I wrote was clumsy and inefficient and more talented programmers would look at it and roll their eyes, much as Rory McIlroy might do if required to play a round with an 18-handicap golfer. But it did the job and in that sense was, in the laconic phrase sometimes used by the great computer scientist Roger Needham, “good enough for government work”. And what I took away from the experience was a lifelong respect for programmers who can write elegant, efficient code. Anyone who thinks programming is easy has never done it. All of which goes to explain why I sat up when, last year, someone realised that Codex, an offspring of GPT-3, a large neural network trained on vast troves of text gathered from the web that could generate plausible English text, could write apps, ie, short computer programs including buttons, text input fields and colours, by remixing snippets of code it had been fed. So you could ask the program to write code to do a simple task – “make a snowstorm on a black background”, for example – and it would write and run the necessary code in Javascript. In no time at all, there were tech startups such as SourceAI aimed at harnessing this new programming tool.  This was impressive, quirky and perhaps useful in some contexts, but really it was just picking low-hanging fruit. Apps are small programs and the kinds of tasks Codex can do are ones that can be described succinctly in ordinary language. All the software has to do is to search through the huge repository of computer code that exists in its database and find a match that will do the job. No real inference or reasoning is required. At this point, DeepMind, the London-based AI company, became interested in the problem. DeepMind is famous for developing the Go-playing world champion AlphaGo and AlphaFold, the machine-learning system that seems better at predicting protein structures than any human. Recently, it announced that it had developed AlphaCode, a new programming engine potentially capable of outperforming many human developers. In classic DeepMind style, the company decided to see how its system would perform on 10 challenges on Codeforces, a platform that hosts worldwide competitive programming contests. Although these challenges are not typical of the average day-to-day workload of programmers, the ability to solve the problems it sets in a creative manner is a good indicator of programming ability. AlphaCode is the first ever AI system capable of competing with humans in this context. Here’s what’s involved: competitors are given five to 10 problems expressed in natural language and allowed three hours to write programs to creatively solve as many problems as possible. This is a much more demanding task than merely specifying an app. For each problem, participants have to read and understand: a natural language description (spanning numerous paragraphs) that contains a narrative background to the problem; a description of the desired solution that competitors need to understand and parse carefully; a specification of the required input and output format; and one or more example input/output pairs. Then they have to write an efficient program that solves the problem. And finally, they have to run the program. The key step – going from problem statement to coming up with a solution – is what makes the competition such a stiff test for a machine, because it requires understanding and reasoning about the problem, plus a deep comprehension of a wide range of algorithms and data structures. The impressive thing about the design of the Codeforces competitions is that it’s not possible to solve problems through shortcuts, such as duplicating solutions seen before or trying out every potentially related algorithm. To do well, you have to be creative. So how did AlphaCode do? Quite well, is the answer. “Overall”, DeepMind reports, it came out “at the level of the median competitor. Although far from winning competitions, this result represents a substantial leap in AI problem-solving capabilities and we hope that our results will inspire the competitive programming community”. Translation: “We’ll be back.” They will. This is beginning to look like the story of Go-playing and protein folding; in both cases, the DeepMind machine starts at the median level and then rapidly outpaces human competition. It will be a quick learner. Does that mean that programmers will become obsolete? No, because software engineering is about building systems, not just about solving discrete puzzles. But if I had to write software now, it would be reassuring to have such a machine as an assistant.

2/13/2022,"Fully vaccinated Britons will no longer be required to undergo Covid tests in order to travel to France, opening up travel between the countries as the half-term holidays get under way. Children under 12 are exempt from testing and vaccination requirements.  Guillaume Bazard, the French consul-general in London, announced the change to the rules on Twitter. He wrote: “As of 12 February, tests will no longer be necessary for travellers with a complete vaccination schedule traveling from the UK to France. Our website will be updated as soon as further details are published.” The relaxation of travel rules had been hinted at earlier in the week, with France’s Europe minister Clément Beaune suggesting that the requirement was likely to be dropped soon. Before the announcement, people travelling to France from outside the EU, including from the UK, were required to present a negative Covid test result from the previous 48 hours, regardless of vaccination status. The change means jabbed holidaymakers travelling between the UK and France do not need to test on either end of their journey, after Britain ended its testing requirement for fully vaccinated arrivals at 4am on Friday. At present, passengers are not required to have had a booster dose to count as fully vaccinated, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has previously said. Under-18s will continue to be treated as eligible double vaccinated passengers but Shapps has said that 12- to 15-year-olds would be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass for international outbound travel. France, where people are asked show a Covid passe sanitaire to enter most public spaces in the country, requires vaccinated travellers to have received their last dose within the past nine months. The move follows Spain easing its travel rules for British passengers aged 12 to 17. Teenagers who have not received two jabs are not presently allowed to enter the country, but will be allowed in from 14 February with a negative PCR test",News/World news,France eases Covid travel restrictions for vaccinated British travellers,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/12/france-eases-covid-travel-restrictions-for-vaccinated-british-travellers
2/13/2022,"Federal prosecutors have charged an “alt-right” podcaster who espoused strong anti-government views with assembling an arsenal of weapons, including machine guns, in the locked basement at a home in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. They also charged his father, the Daily Beast reported.  The pair, Joseph Raymond Berger, 67, and Joseph Paul Berger, 32, were arrested last week and charged with multiple firearms offenses including possessing machine guns, possessing non-registered firearms and possessing non-registered silencers. Both men have pleaded not guilty. According to a detention memo filed by prosecutors, the cache included eight AK-style rifles, two C308 .308 Winchester caliber rifles, two MP5K submachine guns, and one RPK-style machine gun. Prosecutors claimed in opposition to a bail request that the younger man, a navy veteran, “regularly espouses anti-government and anti-law enforcement views”. “To be sure, the defendant’s views do not form the basis for these charges, but they provide strong evidence of his anti-government ethos,” they argued. “Based on these views, it is highly unlikely that the defendant will respect or abide by conditions of release set by this court, thereby making him a danger to the community and a risk of flight.” Their lawyer, Eric Winter, argued in response that Joseph Berger had never incited real-life violence, carried no criminal record, and his views represented political expression. The government cited a podcast episode of Alt-Right Armory in which Berger, the host, said that a “white man with a rifle can be very dangerous to the system indeed if he has the right motivation”. Prosecutors also claimed that Berger “extolls the values of police murderer Eric Frein and fantasizes about the cost that could be incurred by a group of people like Frein”, referring to the 2014 murder of a Pennsylvania state trooper in an ambush. Frein was later captured, convicted and sentenced to death. The defendant, prosecutors said, encouraged listeners to target “not only police, but “legislators, lobbyists and leftwing billionaires” for assassination with explosives. Berger goes by the moniker “GlockDoctor1488” – 1488 being a popular coded signal among neo-Nazis, with “14” referencing the slogan “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children” and “88” standing in for “Heil Hitler”. In 2019, Berger reportedly disrupted an event at a public library in Philadelphia where then Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, was speaking. At the event, Berger reportedly shouted: “Fuck you, you anti-white piece of shit! You will not replace us!” The indictment alleges that the Bergers illegally possessed 13 fully-automatic machine guns and 12 silencers. They were arrested after agents with Customs and Border Protection intercepted three firearms silencers addressed to them at their home that had been illegally imported. Investigators then obtained a search warrant for the home and recovered from the basement the 12 firearms suppressors/silencers and 13 fully-automatic machine guns, according to court documents. Agents also discovered a 3D printer on a table, with the components needed to build so-called ghost guns – guns with no serial number identification. The weapons, the indictment said, had originally been purchased as semi-automatic firearms, and then converted into unregistered, fully automatic machine guns that could fire hundreds of rounds a minute. “The defendants allegedly possessed a stockpile of unregistered fully-automatic machine guns and silencers in violation of the National Firearms Act,” said US attorney Jennifer Arbittier Williams. “These weapons are extremely dangerous, which is why there are laws regulating their possession.” “As the indictment alleges, possession of illegal firearms like these, threatens the safety of the general public, especially when in the wrong hands,” added Matthew Varisco, special agent in charge of ATF’s Philadelphia field division. If convicted, the defendants face a maximum possible sentence of 30 years in prison, three years of supervised release, a $270,000 fine and a $300 special assessment.",News/US news,US far-right podcaster charged after machine guns found in basement,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/12/podcaster-arrested-machine-guns-weapons-basement
