4/4/2022,"Today’s puzzles are all about helping Ukraine. They are written by the Grabarchuk family, who are one of the world’s most original and prolific puzzle creators. Originally from the Western Ukrainian city of Uzhgorod, on the Slovakian border, the family moved to the USA in 2013 on the back of becoming internationally renowned for their puzzle books, websites and apps. Computer science legend Donald Knuth says that Serhiy Grabarchuk, the father of the clan, “has my vote as the world’s current puzzle laureate. His works are particularly beautiful, instructive and fulfilling.” Since the beginning of the war, the Grabarchuks have been publishing a daily puzzle that promotes Ukrainian culture (such as the ‘spot the difference’ of St Sophia’s Cathedral at the top of this story) hoping to raise money for humanitarian and military aid. Below are six puzzles I selected from the family’s archive. If you enjoy them please consider contributing to their suggested causes. Slava Ukraini! 1. Hex vex Which digit should replace the question mark? 2. Ring ding Which system of rings differs from the others? 3. Snake shake Which view of the 11-cube snake is incorrect? 4. Box fox Put a digit in each box so all 8 equations, across and down, are all correct. One box already has a digit. 5. Sign mine Which of the signs in the bottom row should replace the question mark? 6. Ele-mental For each of these six elements, find another element that has no letter in common with its counterpart. Each answer is unique. Hint: all the answers are well-known elements, words that are in a non-chemist’s vocabulary. NO SPOILERS. I’ll be back at 5pm UK with the answers. The Grabarchuk story began five decades ago when Serhiy, now aged 64, was a schoolboy in Uzhgorod. He discovered a talent for making puzzles and magic tricks, and turned it into a career. By the 1990s he and his wife Tanya had a small company publishing puzzle books, and now the business has expanded to websites and apps and involves his sons, Serhiy Jr and Peter, and their wives, Kate and Helen. The family’s most successful puzzle is Strimko, a pencil and paper puzzle in the manner of Sudoku. If you enjoyed today’s puzzles please consider donating to Ukraine. Here are links to the National Bank of Ukraine’s donation pages for humanitarian and military support. The Grabarchuks are on Facebook, Instagram, and here’s their website. Their most recent books are the Age of Puzzles series. All images in this story are their copyright. I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me. I’m the author of several books of puzzles, most recently the Language Lover’s Puzzle Book. I also give school talks about maths and puzzles (online and in person). If your school is interested please get in touch. On Thursday 21 April I’ll be giving a puzzles workshop for Guardian Masterclasses. You can sign up here. ",News/Science,"Can you solve it?

4/4/2022,"As a child, growing up on the Kent coast, Janice Macdonald had a fascination with France that seemed “almost mystical”, she says, with a laugh. She had never been there, but it loomed large in her imagination. Supposedly, you could see Calais from Ramsgate on a clear day, but she never did. “It was right across the English Channel; I was always aware of France.” It took decades to achieve her dream of living there, but she finally did it at the age of 68. Macdonald had been living in the US since she was 17, having emigrated with her mother. She spent most of her life in California, where she raised two children (she is soon to be a great-grandmother). She lived in Washington state in her early 60s, then went back to California for a couple of years to care for her mother. A few months after her 100th birthday, her mother died and “it seemed like now or never” to move to France. Now 77, she had never given age much thought – even if some friends implied that she was too old to move to another continent. “Age wasn’t a problem,” she says. “For me, it was economics – being able to live in France with not much money. I discovered it’s probably easier and less expensive here than it would have been if I had stayed in the US. I’m fortunate to be fairly healthy and have a spirit of: ‘Yeah, I think I can do that.’ Sometimes, you just have to take the leap. You’ll always find reasons not to do things.” She had taken risks before – at 50, she left her job as director of media relations for a large healthcare organisation and “ a lot of security and stability”, to become a freelance writer. She has since written several romantic novels. “If I had thought about it too long, I wouldn’t have done it. It’s the same thing with France, perhaps.” She had only been to France on holiday a few times, didn’t speak French and her search for where to start her new life wasn’t tied to any region in particular. “My main concern was finding a place I could afford to rent,” she says. “It happened to be in the Languedoc [in southern France], which is where I’ve been ever since.” Macdonald pictured herself in a village, taking long walks, buying fresh food at the market and drinking wine with new French friends. She had rented an apartment, unseen, online. When she arrived, “It was a bit of a shock.” She had leased the place for a year, but it was “sort of cave-like”. Dark, with concrete floors and bare, crumbling stone walls. “That was my first big obstacle – how am I going to manage to live here for a year? I learned that it’s a mistake to make assumptions about how it might be to live somewhere before you have even done it.” With no car, she felt trapped. At times she felt lonely, but online she found expat and writers’ groups, and kept in touch with her children and friends in the US on Skype. Six months later, she returned to the US for a few months, half-expecting to feel glad to be “home” and that France had been nothing more than an adventure, but she was surprised to feel the opposite. France, instead, had begun to feel like where she belonged. “I never had any doubt that I wanted to come back,” she says. “I had compared myself to the tumbleweed in the California desert – it just rolls across the desert and doesn’t have deep roots. I feel rooted now in France.” Still, changes had to be made. Macdonald found another apartment in a nearby village, got a car and gradually found it easier to meet people. She made friends with one woman while they were both looking at the village noticeboard. “She noticed my shoes and said: ‘Do you walk?’ We have walked together and it has been really useful because she has helped me with my French, and I have helped her with English. That’s been a great learning experience.” Every day Macdonald writes, walks and sees friends. “I appreciate what feels like a less commercial sort of life, a simpler life, than you can find in the UK or US.” She lives in a winemaking village and, like many of the residents, has become involved in the process. She loves to wander through the vineyards, noticing seasonal changes. “I feel the connection to nature that I really haven’t enjoyed in the same way that I do now,” she says. “I’ve watched the vines drop their leaves, and grow shoots again in the spring.” And the feeling that there is always a fresh start, a new life. Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?",Lifestyle/Life and style, A new start after 60: ‘I moved to France at 68 – it’s where I belong’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/04/a-new-start-after-60-i-moved-to-france-at-68-its-where-i-belong
4/4/2022,"The first single I ever boughtPray by Take That. I was 11 years young and marched straight down to HMV for the CD single. I’m not proud of myself but, come on, I was 11! I probably didn’t even have any pubes. My favourite member? The little one – I can’t even remember his name. [PR chips in] Oh, Mark! The little one! They were the original boyband. [PR chips in] Come on, they shat all over East 17! Boyz II Men?! [Lively debate ensues] Take That ruled the world – I’m not budging. My karaoke go-toI’m absolutely not a karaoke person, but I’m going for Don’t Leave Me This Way, the version [by Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes] with Teddy Pendergrass. You really feel his agony, and he’s also very attractive. It’s super funky, super soulful, and it’s slightly within the realms of me being able to sing it. The song that made my best-ever gig experienceI’m very lucky: my sister’s in a band [Brody Dalle of the Distillers] and I often get to go backstage. This time it was the White Stripes in London and, when they sung Jolene, it blew my socks off. It’s so haunting. You feel Jack White’s pain, his angst – and I love how he hasn’t changed the pronouns. It’s one of those songs that goes straight through you. Not like diarrhoea! Like a bullet. Best song to have sex toKeep It Up by Milton Wright. Of course it depends on the sort of sex you’re having; there’s lots of different types: cuddly sex, naughty tie-me-up sex – different strokes for different folks. But I think I could have quite quite a lot of different types of sex to this one one. Plus it’s absolutely one of my favourite tracks in the world, a Desert Island Disc. Desert Island Dick, ha ha! The song I’d want for my entrance musicWhole Lotta Money by BIA and Nicki Minaj – in an ironic way, in some kind of character, preferably in slow motion with a wind machine, please. And some really cool sneakers, so I look like I’m down with the kids. Just for when I’m going into Pret to get my sandwich. The song I want played at my funeralPlanet Caravan by Black Sabbath feeds my soul – it’s so otherworldly. When you die and move on to another realm, it would be the perfect thing to serenade you. People forget what a legend Ozzy Osbourne was before he was on TV all the time, going on about: “There’s dog mess all over the house.” The song I pretend to hate that I secretly likeTake My Breath Away by Berlin. I blame Top Gun. I was about five when Top Gun came out and – this sounds wrong – I used to pause it when Iceman came on and snog the telly. My favourite song of all timeRight Down the Line by Gerry Rafferty. I actually got a boy back with that song. He was really bad to me, I told him to go away, I didn’t speak to him for months then sent him that track – and he cried. He was over in two shakes of a lamb’s tail. He can bugger off now, but me and one of my best friends play it all the time. My favourite song right nowDreamflower by Tarika Blue, a funky fusion band from the 1970s. It’s so dreamy and blissed out – listen to it mid-bottle of wine or a spliff or whatever you’ve got to hand and just chill.

4/4/2022,"As its title somewhat suggests, the artist Celia Paul’s second book takes the form of a series of letters to Gwen John, whose life, she believes, was “stamped with a similar pattern” to her own, and a postcard of whose painting The Convalescent she keeps in her studio (just one look at it, she says, and her breathing becomes easier). But this description is also – happily, I think – misleading. As anyone who has ever written a love letter will know, such notes inevitably say more about correspondent than recipient. If love is, as Paul suggests, the highest form of attention, it’s also a mirror: a means, marvellous and occasionally highly dangerous, of seeing ourselves anew. I don’t mean at all to suggest that Paul is in love with John. But these are intimate letters, their author seemingly having taken to heart Colette’s writing advice (look at what gives you pleasure, but look longest at what gives you pain), and it’s this that enables me to forgive, if not quite to overlook, the rather fey idea of a one-sided conversation with a woman who died in 1939. When Paul writes as if John were a living, breathing friend – “I am excited that I have begun to communicate with you and don’t want there to be a pause just now” – something in me is embarrassed. I also know a great deal about John already, courtesy of numerous biographers and critics (her brother, her lover, her painfully unquiet heart). In the end, though, neither of these things matter one bit. It is really Paul who’s centre stage, and she is fascinating; I do not feel, at this point, that I could ever tire of her mind, and the unlikely, singular way it turns. I want to know as much about her as I possibly can. To the casual observer, it’s obvious what she and John share: an obsession with, and deep ambition for, their work; the fact that both of them had “complicated, painful love affairs with much older men” (John was, famously, the lover of Auguste Rodin; Paul had a decade-long relationship with Lucian Freud, with whom she had a son, Frank). But these things are really only a kind of impasto: surface layers concealing far finer lines beneath. Both of them speak what Paul calls the “subterranean language” of painting, a dialect that in its most fluent form enables them to express turbulent, unbidden passions, and which, should it break down, becoming stuttering and incoherent, can also cause them great distress. To this, we must add their common asceticism, an extreme unworldliness. It is as if they live almost on air. Paul, whose small flat-cum-studio close to the British Museum is almost devoid of furniture and trinkets, seems sometimes to belong to another age entirely: when, at one point, she describes lying on a chaise longue and turning her face to the wall, I pictured someone in a corset and a long dress. Like John, she will not – she cannot – value material success above love. When Freud was alive, and still in her life, she felt she could not possibly work if he was feeling hostile towards her. Freud is in this book, of course. A spectre. She is still trying to make sense of him (they met when she was a student at the Slade). Attempting to make a portrait of her husband, Steven, who’s dying of cancer, she is alarmed to find that she has painted not his face but Lucian’s; even when the picture is finally finished, she feels her sable brush might have been dipped in smoke rather than paint. But her mother and sisters appear, too, and her son, Frank, who never hugs her (he was brought up by his grandmother, so that Paul might be free to work). Unreciprocated desire, and how – if – it might be quelled, is a theme of this book, as is the notion that, as Gwen John’s brother Augustus once noted, people are apt to mistake independence for fragility in a woman (Gwen didn’t “steal” through life, he said; she was haughty and amorous and proud). Paul, like John, appears before us as frail and steely, shy and determined. So much about her is paradoxical, not least her tendency to paralysing homesickness, a condition that seems so much at odds with her careful avoidance of domesticity. Paul’s memoir, Self-Portrait, which came out in 2019, is to me among the greatest ever books by an artist: up there with Keith Vaughan’s Journals and Outline by Paul Nash. Letters to Gwen John doesn’t quite reach it, but in the end it is also very much an artist’s book, its author at her most insightful when she is writing about her practice (the stink of turps, the right paints and paper), or describing beloved pictures in the National Gallery (Mantegna, Piero della Francesca, Robert Campin). It’s rarer than one imagines, this: so few artists are able to articulate why, and how, they work. Then again, this is a volume born of battles that are, to a degree, universal in the case of women: the cruelty of men, the shame of ambition, the struggle (always!) to find space to think, to be free. Paul is 62 now; this book has been gestating for a long time. Its conception may be traced, I believe, all the way back to the days when Freud kept a headless version of Rodin’s sculpture Iris on his sitting room table. Sitting for him, Paul “feared” the belt he wore, with its sharp buckle. The rag on which he wiped his brushes came gradually to look, she writes, like a butcher’s apron, smeared all over with blood.

4/4/2022,"Travel insurance is designed to compensate you if your holiday is cancelled or something goes wrong while you are away. The type of cover you need depends largely on three factors: where you are going, how long you are going for and who you are travelling with. For most standard policies you will be asked if you are travelling within Europe or beyond. Before you pay for a policy, check to see how the insurer is classifying this. Some European insurance will include certain countries outside the continent, for instance, while worldwide cover can include or exclude travel to the US. Make sure your policy includes the country you are travelling to. Consider how many trips you plan to make. Annual cover tends to be the best value if you are travelling more than twice in a year. Single trip cover may make more financial sense if you are only planning to head away once or twice. Annual cover is not designed for a gap year – there is usually a limit on the length of each trip. If you plan to travel for more than 30 days at a time you will need to seek out a specialist policy. If you are travelling with a partner or with your family, you could save money by covering everyone under the same policy. However, if one member of your party needs specialist cover because of existing medical conditions or their age, it might be more cost effective to cover them separately. You may be turned down for some insurance policies based on your age and existing health conditions but insurers will usually signpost you to a company you can buy from. Consider the type of holiday you are going on, too. Skiing in the French Alps carries a lot more risk to health than sitting on a beach in Spain for a week. Your policy will need to be comprehensive enough to cover the danger – and may cost more as a result. Heading to Europe? Have your European health insurance card (Ehic) or global health insurance card (Ghic) to hand, both of which are free to apply for via the NHS website. These offer you access to medically necessary healthcare for free, or at the cost paid by residents of the country you are in. If you have an existing Ehic that has not expired, it will be valid, but otherwise you may need a Ghic this time round. The ‘G’ or global version of this insurance came in after Brexit and is the one you need if you are a UK citizen travelling in Europe. The Ehic is for non-UK citizens who live in the country, or students and some state pensioners living in the EU. Beware of unofficial sites that charge a fee for you to apply for either of these, as applying directly is free of charge. Despite having the word global in its name, the Ghic does not offer worldwide cover – it works in the EU and Switzerland – you can check the list of destinations online. The Ghic is not an alternative or a substitute for an extensive travel insurance policy and does not offer protection against any private medical costs. Some insurers may require you to have a Ghic, so it’s a good idea to read your policy conditions and apply for one. This will usually depend on the cost of your holiday and what you think you will be taking with you. The consumer group Which? recommends looking for policies that: include £5m worth of emergency medical cover and £1m worth of personal liability cover; will pay out £2,000, or the value of your holiday, in the event of cancellation, curtailment or a missed departure; and include up to £1,500 for personal belongings and money. Research by Which? found that the most expensive travel insurance was not always the best and that holidaymakers were being quoted wildly different prices for the same level of protection. “To avoid paying over the odds, shop around for the right policy rather than staying loyal to one provider,” a spokesperson for Which? says. “A quote from a rival company can act as a bargaining chip with an existing insurer. Comparison websites can also be a useful tool for gauging market prices.” When looking at prices make sure you are comparing like with like, and pay attention to the excess. This is what you’ll pay towards what your insurer will pay out to you in compensation. Ensure you are able to afford the excess in the event that you do have to claim. According to the Association of British Insurers, policies that provide more cover and those with lower excesses tend to be more expensive but may be better value in the long run. The pandemic has been the biggest reason for holiday plans to go wrong over the past two years, so it is wise to check what cover is being offered if Covid-19 strikes. Look out for: coronavirus medical and repatriation cover to pay out if you are infected when you are away or coronavirus cancellation cover, which will offer a refund if you are unable to travel. Only the best policies will include cover for cancellations down to changes in Foreign Office advice because of Covid-19 and lockdown rules. If your holiday or flight is cancelled, bear in mind that insurers will only pay out for money you can’t claim back in other ways. Contact your accommodation and transport providers for refunds first before you give them a call. Travel insurance is sometimes included as an extra service on a bank account or credit card. If you already have this kind of policy, check what cover it offers. It may be sufficient protection for your needs – or it may still be more suitable to shop for a standalone deal. If you are booking through a travel agent, you may also be offered insurance as part of the package. If your agent tries to make you buy from it, however, or increases the cost of your holiday if you turn it down, it is breaking the law. You can contact Citizens Advice for further information on how to make a complaint. Stick to what you need – and uncheck boxes offering anything that doesn’t apply to you. You might not use pet cover as part of your insurance plan, or gadget cover if your mobile phone and laptop are already protected via your home contents insurance. It pays to read up on what you can already claim under your existing insurance policies before you take the plunge and buy a new one.",Lifestyle/Money,How to get a good deal on travel insurance,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/04/how-to-get-a-good-deal-on-travel-insurance
4/4/2022,"Hello, welcome to this Guardian morning briefing on Monday 4 April 2022 with me, Warren Murray. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has addressed Russian forces as “butchers”, “murderers”, “torturers” and “rapists” responsible for genocide after hundreds of bodies of Ukrainian civilians were found in towns surrounding Kyiv. “What did the man who was riding his bicycle down the street do? … I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being fulfilled … This is how the Russian state will now be perceived.” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dymtro Kuleba, said Russia was “worse than Isis”. Zelenskiy has vowed to investigate and prosecute all Russian crimes in Ukraine, saying he had created a “special mechanism” to do so. Witnesses in Bucha told the Guardian that Russian soldiers fired on men fleeing the town and killed civilians at will. Taras Schevchenko, 43, said some bodies were left “squashed by tanks … like animal skin rugs”. Reporters from Agence France-Presse saw at least 20 bodies in civilian clothing strewn across a single street in Bucha. One had his hands tied behind his back with a white cloth, his Ukrainian passport lying beside him. “All these people were shot,” said Bucha’s mayor, Anatoly Fedoruk, adding that a further 280 bodies had been buried in mass graves. Be warned that the following video is grim and graphic in parts. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said he was “deeply shocked” while Boris Johnson said the killings added to evidence of Russian war crimes. The UK was committed to “further ramping up sanctions to increase the economic pressure on Putin’s war machine”. Britain’s ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, said it was clear that rape had also been used as a weapon of war by Russian forces. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, described Bucha as “a punch to the gut”. Russia for its part tried to paint the situation as somehow representing a “provocation” by Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly claimed, without proof, that Ukraine has staged such atrocities for its own benefit. But the Kremlin line is starkly contradicted by ample evidence on the ground, as well as Putin’s past form of having no compunction about slaughtering civilians. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, expressed shock about the “terrible and horrifying” footage from Bucha. There are calls for further sanctions – Germany has been resisting an immediate ban on Russian fossil fuels, but now its defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, has said the EU should consider a ban on gas imports from Russia. Latvian authorities announced that all three Baltic states had stopped importing Russian gas since 1 April. “If we can do it, the rest of Europe can too,” said Lithuania’s president, Gitanes Nausėda. Follow today’s developments at our live blog. Grammys 2022 – Olivia Rodrigo and R&B duo Silk Sonic have dominated the major categories while Jon Batiste won album of the year at the 64th annual Grammys, where there was a video message from Volodymyr Zelenskiy and an emotional tribute to victims of the Russian invasion. A week after Will Smith slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars, Grammys host Trevor Noah said: “We’re gonna be listening to some music, we’re gonna be dancing, we’re gonna be singing, we’re gonna be keeping people’s names out of our mouths.” Zelenskiy’s message served as an intro to a John Legend performance of Free along with Ukrainian musicians Mika Newton and Suizanna Iglidan and Ukrainian poet Lyuba Yakimchuk. Doja Cat exclaimed “I have never taken such a fast piss in my whole life!” after apparently rushing from the bathroom to the stage to accept best pop duo performance with SZA, for Kiss Me More. Silk Sonic, aka Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak, grooved on to the stage for both record and song of the year. “We are really trying our hardest to remain humble at this point,” Anderson .Paak quipped. “Drinks is on Silk Sonic tonight!” Jon Batiste closed the evening with, fittingly, a celebration of music for album of the year. Broken swings and karaoke – Some Downing Street staff have been told they will be issued with fines by police over their attendance at a party the night before Prince Philip’s funeral, while indoor social mixing was banned by Covid regulations. It is the first decision by Scotland Yard that Covid laws were broken inside No 10. Two parties for the departure of Downing Street staff members took place on the evening of 16 April, and Downing Street staff were said to have got so drunk they broke the swing used by the prime minister’s son, Wilf, in the garden. Scotland Yard said it would not confirm which events fines had been issued for, or the identity of anyone who received a fixed-penalty notice. Meanwhile, it has emerged that Helen MacNamara, the Cabinet Office’s then head of ethics, attended a June 2020 leaving do where it is understood she supplied a karaoke machine. Calls continue for Boris Johnson to resign over partygate after he told parliament in December that “all guidance was followed completely in No 10”. Orbán entrenched – Viktor Orbán has won a fourth successive term as Hungary’s prime minister, capping a campaign dominated by his isolated stance on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Orbán’s victory speech appeared to mock Volodymyr Zelenskiy: “We had the biggest [range of opponents to] overpower … even the Ukrainian president in the end.” Counting on Sunday night put Orbán’s Fidesz party at 135 seats in the 199-member parliament. Fidesz has tightened its grip on office by controlling media ownership and manipulating the voting system. Zelenskiy has branded Orbán as Putin’s sole European supporter. Separately, Serbia’s centre-right president Aleksandar Vučić and his Serbian Progressive party (SNS) are on track to be declared landslide winners after general elections on Sunday. Labour NDA outcry – A dozen senior Labour women have called on the party to end its use of confidentiality agreements to “cover up” sexual harassment allegations. Laura Murray, Labour’s ex-head of complaints, and Georgie Robertson, who worked in the party’s press office, said they refused to sign non-disclosure agreements after their complaints. After the BBC revealed their allegations, 12 senior Labour women wrote to the party’s ruling body saying they were “appalled”. Labour has denied it uses any non-disclosure agreements that would stop anyone speaking out about sexual harassment, and says it “takes any complaints of sexual harassment extremely seriously, which are fully investigated and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken in line with the party’s rules and procedures”. South Asia’s political crises – Sri Lanka’s entire cabinet aside from the president and his sibling prime minister have resigned from their posts as the ruling Rajapaksa clan faces continued demonstrations over a severe economic crisis. A social media blackout and nationwide curfew have failed to halt protests sparked by severe shortages of food and fuel, crippling power cuts and record inflation. The president may appoint a new cabinet today. Sri Lanka’s main opposition alliance, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), has said it is time for the government to resign and end President Rajapaksa’s “autocratic rule”. Elsewhere in south Asia: Imran Khan is facing accusations of treason after he dissolved Pakistan’s parliament and called fresh elections to block a no-confidence vote that was expected to remove him as prime minister. Cash for jabs – A 60-year-old man is said to have received up to 90 Covid-19 shots in Germany so he could sell the vaccination cards to others. The man from Magdeburg is under police investigation for issuing vaccination cards without authorisation and document forgery, it has been reported.

Antonio Conte declared his Tottenham team to be “now in the race” for Champions League qualification after they swept Newcastle away with a devastating second-half performance in a 5-1 win. Heather Knight has said she takes “a lot of pride” in her England side, despite their defeat by Australia in the World Cup final in Christchurch after Nat Sciver hit an unbeaten century to take England to within 72 runs of their mammoth 357-run target. Oxford won the men’s Boat Race for the first time since 2017, while Cambridge women continued their recent domination as the races returned to the Thames. Louis van Gaal, the Netherlands coach and former Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Ajax manager, has revealed he has been receiving treatment for an “aggressive” form of prostate cancer. Carlos Alcaraz defeated Casper Ruud 7-5, 6-4 to win the Miami Open final and confirm the young Spaniard’s arrival among the tennis elite. Sam Kerr and Bethany England both scored twice and Jessie Fleming added another as Chelsea recorded a commanding 5-0 win over Reading at the Kingsmeadow to return to the top of the WSL in style. Jennifer Kupcho took the final victory leap into Poppie’s Pond after the American won her first major with victory at the Chevron Championship. And Tiger Woods will make a last-minute call on whether to stage an incredible comeback at the Masters but every available indication so far suggests the 15-time major champion will take to the first tee at Augusta National on Thursday. World share markets have been mixed so far. A holiday in China has made for sluggish trading. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan inched up 0.3% in morning trading while Japan’s Nikkei dipped along with S&P 500 stock futures and Nasdaq futures. This morning the FTSE will open higher according to futures trading. The pound is worth $1.311 and €1.186 at time of writing. Revulsion at the atrocities committed by Russian forces in the Ukrainian town of Bucha dominates today’s front pages. The Guardian shows a scene of destruction with the headline: “Horror in Bucha: Russia accused of torture and massacre of civilians”. The Mirror says simply “Genocide” in its headline under the bleak strapline: “Putin’s latest atrocities”. The Times has “Civilians shot in the streets” and reports many victims had been bound “execution style” – its journalists visited two sites in Bucha. The i emphasises those killed were civilians: “Massacre of the innocents”. It notes Boris Johnson’s call to “starve Putin’s war machine”. The Financial Times reports on the prospect of a full oil and fuel embargo – in the wake of Bucha, EU diplomats are expected to discuss further measures on Wednesday. The Telegraph says the UK and its allies will not rest until Vladimir Putin is held responsible. The Daily Mail likens the scenes in Ukraine to “the atrocities of the Nazis, and Stalin’s Great Terror”. The headline is “Putin’s stain on humanity”. Metro quotes the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, for its headline: “Worse than Isis”. The Daily Express says Boris Johnson wants to “make Putin pay for ‘despicable’ war crimes”. The Sun notes Johnson’s comments in a side story on its front page. The Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.

4/4/2022,"Long before I became pregnant, I would ask people how they knew that they wanted to have children. Was there a lightning moment, or had the longing grown and grown until it became too much to ignore? Of course, the answers I got were as varied as people themselves. Some were able to distill it into a clear instant: taking hold of a small child’s hand for the first time, or seeing a baby on a bus one day and knowing, suddenly. Others were influenced by life events: the death of a parent was a common one, leading them to reflect on how bloodlines unfurl, wanting to see a little of that beloved parent manifest in a new being. Others had always known, in their bones, since their own childhoods. Then, for women, there was the so-called biological clock. Not so much a desire for a child, but an awareness that time could be running out, and a sort of not-wanting, a double negative: not-wanting to have not had a child. Many of these women expressed guilt at not having felt “the longing”, as though an innate-seeming, visceral dose of baby fever was the norm, and, in their absence of strong maternal feelings, they were deviating from it. But it does not seem that way to me, and besides, my own feelings were far from simple. At times it felt as though my body was at war with my brain. There were so many rational reasons not to become a parent, and yet the longing I felt was so powerful that it was making me unspeakably sad not to be. I say “body”, but of course I don’t know. I can write only of how it felt, but scientifically, the jury remains out on whether the desire for parenthood is down to nature or nurture, and both biology and culture are likely to contribute. We are social animals, and social pressure can be enormous. I like to think that I was immune to this, though during 2020-21 it felt as though everyone I knew was having a baby, except me. I sat on the sidelines, wanting it, but dithering. It is, of course, a privilege to dither. Before the advent of contraception, becoming a parent couldn’t really be described as a decision at all. Perhaps this is why my search for historical sources that showed women interrogating the question was rather fruitless. Even speaking to women of older generations, who came of age post-contraception, there’s a sense that there wasn’t much thought given to the question. “It’s just what you did”, is a sentence that came up, time and time again, and several older women have expressed their admiration for my generation for taking the prospect so seriously. Role models are also a factor. My mother has quite a few friends who are child-free, and so I never grew up believing that motherhood was destiny. I knew that there were many kinds of life that one could have, and also that I could have a relationship with children in other ways: as an aunt, a godparent, a friend. In fact, I found that the decision to be child-free was far better documented than the decision to become a parent. It feels as though there is still a taboo when it comes to expressing having had entirely rational doubts about becoming a parent, only to go ahead and take the plunge. I have lost count of the number of times that I have read that you should only do so if you are “100% sure”. As someone who, for a variety of reasons, has never been 100% sure about anything in my life, that feels pretty shaming. It feels to me as though we need more open conversations about the decision-making process, and better ways of supporting people who are in the midst of it. We are surrounded by panic about the birthrate – for the first time in history, half the women in England and Wales have not had a child by the time they reach 30, yet there still seems to be little exploration of the fact that many western countries are what could be termed hostile environments for new parents. There are many reasons – economic, educational, environmental – why a person may delay parenthood, and my generation and those younger than it face unprecedented hardships. On top of that, there is evidence to suggest that women are happier without children and a spouse. When a happiness expert spoke about this in 2019, people were enraged, but the fact remains that the sexist balance of domestic labour makes a lot of women miserable, and who can blame them for choosing another path? As with anything to do with parenthood, we could do with less judgment, and more listening. And perhaps, as Sheila Heti suggests in Motherhood, the constant questioning is all “a huge conspiracy to keep women in their thirties – when you finally have some brains and some skills and experience – from doing anything useful with them at all”. What’s working: Even though I decided motherhood was for me, I found the 2015 essay collection Selfish, Shallow, and Self-Absorbed: Sixteen Writers on the Decision Not to Have Kids fascinating, especially as it included men, one of whom (Geoff Dyer), as the New York Times reviewer pointed out, shows “what it looks like to have a relationship to the topic that is completely unburdened by guilt or self-doubt”. What isn’t: I find myself hating the tone of a lot of pregnancy books targeted at women, which feel infantilising and identity-sapping. I dislike being referred to as a disembodied “mum”, and language such as “lady garden” and “sore parts” makes me want to scream. As for some of the advice, a section on the idea of “freedom Friday” – which sees a husband deign to give his wife one “night off” a week, followed by “top tips on how not to hate your partner” made me wonder if I had entered a wormhole straight to the 1950s. Sadly, barbiturates were not suggested as a remedy. Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,To have a child or not is a huge decision.

4/4/2022,"High-carbon goods imported into the UK should be subject to new tariffs, to help ensure other countries are fulfilling their obligations to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions as well as the UK, an influential committee of MPs has said. A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) would penalise companies and countries trying to evade responsibility for cutting emissions, the MPs said, and provide an incentive for certain industrial sectors to move away from environmentally damaging practices. Philip Dunne, the Tory chair of the committee, said such a move was needed to reach net zero: “The targets, timetables and overall strategy for meeting net zero have been set: now the work must speed up to make the ambitions a reality.” For some industries, such as steelmaking, moving to the greener production methods needed to cut the UK’s emissions in line with the 2050 net zero target may incur short-term costs, in new equipment and techniques. But if rivals in other countries fail to take such steps, and carry on using fossil fuels and emitting high amounts of carbon, their products could be cheaper and undercut the UK, leaving British industry at a severe disadvantage. This is known as carbon leakage, as greener industries in the domestic market lose out and the carbon is emitted overseas instead. A CBAM could level the playing field, by imposing tariffs or taxes on imports of such products, and has broad support among many economists, provided it can be used to target specific products and practices rather than be used as a protectionist measure to keep out goods from developing countries in particular. The environmental audit committee of MPs called on ministers to act unilaterally in putting such a tax in place. The EU is considering imposing CBAMs, and the US government has also signalled it could be open to such measures in the future. The Treasury is understood to be wary of imposing CBAMs, as they could increase the price of some goods at a time when consumers are already facing a cost-of-living crisis. There are also fears in government that implementing a CBAM now would set back attempts by ministers to forge post-Brexit trade deals around the world. But Dunne said the MPs had considered these points carefully. “Our committee is clear that the pros of a CBAM outweigh the cons,” he said. “For too long the emissions from our consumption have effectively been ‘offshored’, leaving the problem as out of sight and out of mind. But we must all take greater responsibility for our consumption and the practices that our businesses and organisations adopt.” The UK is president of the UN climate negotiations for most of the rest of this year, having hosted the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow last November. That puts the government in a powerful position to pioneer CBAMs, which have been widely discussed for years but not put into effect. Dunne added that the government should consult with businesses at all stages: “Our committee is under no illusions that this will be a challenging policy to get right, with a clear advantage to moving multilaterally with other trading partners, and therefore all businesses must have a voice in the discussions, and government must be upfront with its intentions.” A Treasury spokesperson said: “The UK is leading the way on the transition to net zero, has reduced emissions faster than any other country in the G20 and continues to have the most ambitious climate targets for 2030. “As we transition to net zero, we recognise the importance of continuing to address the risk of carbon leakage to ensure that our ambitious policy of decarbonisation is not undermined. “This is a global problem, which is why we’re working with our international partners to address this and other climate challenges as well as exploring domestic options.”",News/Environment,"High-carbon goods imported into UK should be subject to new tariffs, say MPs",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/04/high-carbon-goods-imported-to-uk-should-be-subject-to-new-tariffs-say-mps
4/4/2022,"Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Russia’s public image is now one of torture and execution after the retreat of Russian forces in the town of Bucha led to the discovery of the killing of hundreds of civilians. Calling Russian soldiers “murderers”, “butchers” and “rapists”, Zelenskiy said late on Sunday: “your culture and human appearance perished together with the Ukrainian men and women”. He warned that “even worse things” may be found in other occupied regions. Ukrainian officials said the bodies of 410 civilians have been found in Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian forces. Satellite images taken late last week show a 14-metre (45ft) mass grave in Bucha near the Church of St Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints. Maxar, the company that took the pictures, said the first signs of excavation for a mass grave there were seen on 10 March, several weeks into the invasion. Witnesses of alleged atrocities in Bucha told the Guardian that Russian soldiers had fired on men fleeing the town, and had killed civilians at will. Taras Schevchenko, 43, said Russian soldiers had refused to allow men to leave through a humanitarian corridor, instead shooting at them as they fled across an open field. Bodies, he said, were scattered on the pavements, with some of those killed having been “squashed by tanks … like animal skin rugs”. Shevchenko’s mother, Yevdokia, 77, said she had witnessed an elderly man who had challenged a Russian soldier being shot dead as his wife stood next to him. “They shot him dead, and ordered the woman to leave,” she said. The accounts could not be independently verified. Photographs from the town showed a scene of devastation, with hunks of charred and destroyed tanks and armoured vehicles lined up along one street, along with dead bodies. Zelenskiy on Sunday made a surprise video appearance at the Grammy Awards celebration in Las Vegas and appealed to viewers to support his country “in any way you can”. “Fill the silence with your music. Fill it today, to tell our story. Support us in any way you can. Any, but not silence,” Zelenskiy said in English in a video introducing John Legend’s performance of Free and featured Ukrainian musicians and a reading by Ukrainian poet Lyuba Yakimchuck. Russia denied responsibility for the killing of civilians. Its defence ministry described the photos and videos from towns such as Bucha as “another staged performance by the Kyiv regime”, echoing a similar claim made after the bombing of a children’s and maternity hospital in Mariupol. Figures around the world have condemned the brutality of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s forces. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, said the “despicable” killings added to evidence of Russian war crimes, while the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, expressed shock about the “terrible and horrifying” footage from Bucha. “Streets littered with bodies. Bodies buried in makeshift conditions. There is talk of women, children and the elderly among the victims,” Scholz said. His defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, said the European Union should consider a ban on gas imports from Russia. US secretary of state Antony Blinken described the images from retaken towns as “a punch in the gut” while United Nations secretary general António Guterres called for an independent investigation. The head of the European Council, Charles Michel, said he was shocked by “haunting images of atrocities committed by [the] Russian army”, adding that “further EU sanctions and support are on their way”. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said she was “appalled by reports of unspeakable horrors in areas from which Russia is withdrawing”. An independent investigation was urgently needed, she said, and “perpetrators of war crimes will be held accountable”. Zelenskiy said he expected a UN security council meeting on Tuesday to discuss the atrocities, and was scathing on Sunday night of a historic western policy of “appeasing” Russia by failing to make Ukraine a Nato member 14 years ago at a summit Bucharest. He invited former German and French leaders Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy to visit Bucha “to see what the policy of concessions” to Russia has led to, and urged Ukraine’s allies to do more than increase sanctions. Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia warned on Monday against inferring much from the withdrawal of Russian forces around Kyiv. “They are now regrouping. They are using it as an operational pause and I’m sure they will mount another assault and therefore we need support of the free world to help us fight,” said ambassador Vasyl Myroshnychenko. “We see civilians’ dead bodies lying around the city, many of them have their hands tied up. We are now collecting the evidence from the witnesses,” Myroshnychenko said of the recent discoveries in town such as Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel. “Multiple rapes of women, children killed. This is a massacre.” The west needed to provide heavy weapons, air defence systems, anti-ship missiles, armoured, vehicles, tanks and planes to help Ukraine, the ambassador said. “It’s only two and a half flight from Kyiv to Paris. We’re in the middle of Europe and this is happening now in the 21st century.” In other developments: Work is under way to bring the town of Bucha “back to life”, said Zelenskiy, with critical infrastructure such as power, water and hospital care being restored. The Ukrainian military claimed in its operational report on Monday morning that Russia has launched a “hidden mobilisation” of around 60,000 soldiers to replenish units lost in Ukraine. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba urged the international criminal court and international organisations to come to the region to collect evidence of Russian war crimes. Speaking on Times Radio on Sunday, he said Bucha was a “deliberate massacre”. Describing Russia as “worse than Isis”, he said Russian forces were guilty of murder, torture, rape and looting. He also urged G7 countries to impose “devastating” sanctions immediately. The capture of Mariupol is a “key objective” of the Russian invasion, UK’s ministry of defence said as heavy fighting continues in the southeastern city.",News/World news,"Russia now synonymous with Bucha killings, says Zelenskiy",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/russia-now-synonymous-with-bucha-massacre-zelenskiy-says-amid-global-outcry-at-civilian-killings
