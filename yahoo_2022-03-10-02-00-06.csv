3/10/2022,"HELSINKI, March 9 (Reuters) - Finnair on Wednesday said it had noticed interference with its planes' GPS signals near Russia's Kaliningrad enclave, while other aircraft reported similar problems near Finland's eastern border with Russia since Sunday, Finnish authorities said. The interference began soon after Finland's President Sauli Niinisto met U.S. counterpart Joe Biden in Washington on Saturday to discuss deepening defence ties between Finland and NATO due to Russia's attack on Ukraine. Prime Minister Sanna Marin told Reuters on Wednesday she had no information about the source of the disturbances, nor about whether they originated in Russia, while the Foreign ministry said it was looking into the events. ""If they would be caused by outside influence, it would surely be said publicly,"" Marin said. The Kremlin did not immediately reply to a request for comment about the reported interference. Some of Finnair's Asian flights and most of its European ones go past Kaliningrad, which is sandwiched between NATO members Lithuania and Poland on the Baltic Sea's eastern coast, the company told Reuters. ""Our pilots have noticed interference in GPS near the Kaliningrad area in the past few days,"" a spokesperson for Finland's national carrier said in an email. Some 10 aircraft have also reported unusual disturbances in GPS signals near Finland's eastern border with Russia since last Sunday, Finnish Transport and Communications Agency Traficom said on Tuesday. Traficom said it had asked aviation authorities to alert aircraft pilots to the situation by issuing an official Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) notification. The disturbances were continuing, it said. ""Flying is still safe. Airlines have operational procedures for such situations if the GPS signal is lost,"" Traficom's director Jari Pontinen said in a statement. Lithuanian airline Transaviabaltika told Reuters it had been forced to cancel 18 flights from Helsinki to Savonlinna in eastern Finland after the lack of GPS made it impossible to land because the airport does not have alternative navigation equipment. ""We have made three attempts to fly to Savonlinna. So far, we have not succeeded,"" Manager Rene Must from Transaviabaltika told Reuters. Electromagnetic radiation from the sun and signal jamming are the only two reasons that could explain such long-lasting disturbances that affect several planes, Director Jukka Savolainen from HybridCoE, a pan-European organisation that seeks to counter hybrid threats, told Reuters. ""States can have systems to see where the jamming comes from if they happen to be turned on and in that direction,"" he said.

3/10/2022,"A Black Dunkin’ Donuts employee based in Tampa, Florida had confronted an angry customer who was using racial slurs toward him, resulting in a fatal punch to the customer. The employee, Corey Pujols, has pleaded guilty to felony battery and has been sentenced to two years of house arrest, reported CBS News.
 Vonelle Cook, 77, was reportedly a regular at this particular Dunkin’ store. According to the court records obtained by NBC, Cook went to order a coffee in the drive-thru and he began berating the employees for poor service after they said they were having trouble hearing him.

Toasted: Jerk Chicken Empanadas and Mango Chili Sauce From NBC: He was asked to leave, but he parked his car and went inside the store. When Cook appeared inside the store, Pujols asked a coworker to call police. Prosecutors said Cook began arguing with Pujols. Once Cook said the racial slur, Pujols walked around the counter and told him not to say that again. When he repeated it, Pujols hit him in the jaw and Cook fell to the floor. An autopsy said he suffered a skull fracture and brain contusions. Cook died three days later from his injuries, as reported by CBS. Pujols was originally charged with manslaughter however, prosecutors found Pujols did not have intentions of killing Cook considering his youth and lack of a criminal record. “Two of the primary factors were the aggressive approach the victim took toward the defendant and everyone working with the defendant, and that the victim repeatedly used possibly the most aggressive and offensive term in the English language,” said Grayson Kamm, a spokesperson for Hillsborough State Attorney Andrew Warren, via Tampa Bay Times. A Tampa judge sentenced Corey Pujols to two years of house arrest and ordered 200 hours of community service and an anger management course.",U.S./The Root,"Dunkin’ Employee Fatally Punches Man who Used Racial Slur, Charged and Sentenced",https://news.yahoo.com/dunkin-employee-fatally-punches-man-155759470.html
3/10/2022,"The crew of the Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov's superyacht was fired on Monday, reports said. The company that staffed the boat said sanctions meant crew wages couldn't be paid, Forbes reported. Usmanov's estimated worth is $18.4 billion, and his yacht is valued at $600 million to $735 million. The crew of the Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov's 512-foot superyacht was fired after Western sanctions prevented wages from being paid to the vessel's staff, multiple outlets reported. Sarnia Yachts, a yacht-management company in the UK that provided the crew for the $600 million vessel, Dilbar, said in an email to staff on Monday that ""normal operation of the yacht has ceased,"" and that its crew had to be dismissed ""as a result of the sanctions imposed,"" Forbes reported. The West has imposed heavy sanctions on Russia, with the aim of crippling its economy and cutting off its military's funding, in an attempt to pressure President Vladimir Putin to end the invasion of Ukraine. The West has imposed sanctions not only on Russian banks but also on Russian elites and oligarchs, and they include the seizure of assets such as private jets and superyachts. The European Union, UK, US, and Switzerland have all sanctioned Usmanov, freezing his assets and, in some cases, barring him from entering their territory. The EU said Usmanov ""actively supported"" the Russian government's policies of the destabilization of Ukraine. Usmanov is worth an estimated $18.4 billion, the UK government said. He is the founder of USM Holdings, which has interests in metals, mining, and telecoms. His largest holding is in the Russian steel giant Metalloinvest. The European Union said he had ""particularly close ties"" to the Kremlin, calling him one of ""Putin's favorite oligarchs."" The US has declared Dilbar ""blocked property,"" which prohibits US staff from working on the vessel and bans the payment for its docking fees in US dollars. Sarnia said in Monday's email to staff that the sanctions meant that some of the companies supporting Dilbar's crew were ""unable to continue their normal lines of business,"" Forbes reported. Sarnia added that it was unable to continue paying salaries to the ship's crew, and that their final wages would instead be paid by the boat's owner, Forbes said. ""We have tried all avenues to find a solution to keep the team in place, and protect our positions, but have reached the end of the road of possibilities,"" Tim Armstrong, the yacht's captain, wrote in a message to the crew, Bloomberg reported. The US Treasury said Dilbar's estimated value was between $600 million and $735 million, and that it cost an estimated $60 million per year to run. Its builder, Lürssen, says it's the ""largest motor yacht in the world by gross tonnage."" The vessel is equipped with two helicopter pads and has its own 82-foot swimming pool. Forbes reported that the ship usually had 96 crew members on board, while Bloomberg put the figure at 80. Sarnia said in the email to the crew that a small number of staff from Lürssen, which owns the Hamburg shipyard where Dilbar has been docked for a refitting since October, would instead look after the ""safety and security"" of the ship, Forbes reported. Forbes also reported that Dilbar had been seized by German authorities on March 2, but it issued a correction the following day that said the ship hadn't been impounded. Hamburg's Ministry for Economy and Innovation told Bloomberg that Dilbar wouldn't be able to leave the port until it received an export waiver from Germany's federal customs agency. Lürssen declined to comment. Sarnia Yachts and Hamburg's Ministry for Economy and Innovation did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

3/10/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed an executive order on government oversight of cryptocurrency that urges the Federal Reserve to explore whether the central bank should jump in and create its own digital currency. The Biden administration views the explosive popularity of cryptocurrency as an opportunity to examine the risks and benefits of digital assets, said a senior administration official who previewed the order Tuesday on the condition of anonymity, terms set by the White House. Under the executive order, Biden also has directed the Treasury Department and other federal agencies to study the impact of cryptocurrency on financial stability and national security. Brian Deese and Jake Sullivan, Biden's top economic and national security advisers, respectively, said the order establishes the first comprehensive federal digital assets strategy for the United States. ""That will help position the U.S. to keep playing a leading role in the innovation and governance of the digital assets ecosystem at home and abroad, in a way that protects consumers, is consistent with our democratic values and advances U.S. global competitiveness,"" Deese and Sullivan said Wednesday in a joint statement. The action comes as lawmakers and administration officials are increasingly voicing concern that Russia may be using cryptocurrency to avoid the impact of sanctions imposed on its banks, oligarchs and oil industry due to the invasion of Ukraine. Last week, Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Mark Warner, and Jack Reed asked the Treasury Department to provide information on how it intends to inhibit cryptocurrency use for sanctions evasion. The Biden administration has argued that Russia won’t be able to make up for the loss of U.S. and European business by turning to cryptocurrency. Officials said the Democratic president's order had been in the works for months before Russia's Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine last month. Daleep Singh, a deputy national security and economic adviser to Biden, told CNN on Wednesday that “crypto’s really not a workaround for our sanctions.” The executive order had been widely anticipated by the finance industry, crypto traders, speculators and lawmakers who have compared the cryptocurrency market to the Wild West. Despite the risks, the government said, surveys show that roughly 16% of adult Americans — or 40 million people — have invested in cryptocurrencies. And 43% of men age 18-29 have put their money into cryptocurrency. Coinbase Global Inc., the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, said the company had not seen a recent surge in sanctions evasion activity. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said last week that “many participants in the cryptocurrency networks are subjected to anti-money laundering sanctions” and that the industry is not ""completely one where things can be evaded.” As for the Federal Reserve getting involved with digital assets, the central bank issued a paper in January that said a digital currency “would best serve the needs” of the country through a model in which banks or payment firms create accounts or digital wallets. Some participants in digital currency welcome the idea of more government involvement with crypto. Adam Zarazinski, CEO of Inca Digital, a crypto data company that does work for several federal agencies, said the order presents the opportunity to provide “new approaches to finance.” “The U.S. has an interest in growing financial innovation,"" Zarazinksi said. He added that China and Russia were looking at crypto and building their own currency. More than 100 countries have begun or are piloting their own digital sovereign currency, according to the White House. Katherine Dowling, general counsel for Bitwise Asset Management, a cryptocurrency asset management firm, said an executive order that provides more legal clarity on government oversight would be “a long term positive for crypto.” But Hilary Allen, a financial regulation professor at American University, cautioned against moving too fast to embrace cryptocurrencies. “I think crypto is a place where we should be putting the brakes on this innovation until it’s better understood,” she said. “As crypto becomes more integrated into our financial system it creates vulnerabilities not just to those who are investing in crypto but for everybody who participates in our economy.” On Tuesday, the Treasury Department said its financial literacy arm would work to develop consumer-friendly materials to help people ""make informed choices about digital assets.” “History has shown that, without adequate safeguards, forms of private money have the potential to pose risks to consumers and the financial system,” said Nellie Liang, undersecretary for domestic finance. ___ Associated Press writers Thalia Beaty in New York and Christopher Rugaber in Washington contributed to this report.",Business/Associated Press,Biden signs order on cryptocurrency as its use explodes,https://news.yahoo.com/biden-signing-order-cryptocurrency-explodes-110021459.html
