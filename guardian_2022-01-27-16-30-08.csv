You can remove them once in the water, just before diving,” says Salim Vasquez, 14, pushing her dreadlocks away from her mask. She distributes the equipment to her fellow divers, who are aged between 14 and 24, and Ana María Arenas, a group coordinator. It is 8am on a cloudy Sunday morning in Puerto Viejo, a Jamaican-inspired city in the south of Costa Rica. The young conservationists are preparing to dive into the Caribbean water for their weekly reef monitoring.  Adir Garrido, Maitén Moore, Anumí Sassaroli, Esteban Gallo and Salim, as well as almost two dozen local divers, are part of the Ambassadors of the Sea Community Diving Centre, a non-profit organisation created in 2014 to provide opportunities for young people to do conservation work, such as seabed cleaning, reef monitoring, water pollution analysis, and underwater archaeology. “I was one of the four founders with my brothers and my neighbour,” remembers Esteban, 24. Now he is setting up his own business: a mechanical workshop to fix diving equipment. “It’s not easy to be young in Puerto Viejo. We don’t have opportunities, most of my classmates are involved in drug dealing and petty crime. The centre took us out of this context and opened doors in sea protection.” The idea for the centre came from María Suárez Toro, a Puerto Rican journalist and fisher who arrived in Costa Rica 50 years ago. Her love of the sea started in childhood when she learned to fish, swim and walk almost at the same age. “Here, scuba diving has always been an activity for tourists, too expensive for locals. Not any more for the youth of the centre, who dive with a purpose,” says Suárez. Supported by the United Nations Office for Project Services (Unops), the centre has so far offered 200 free training courses in open water and rescue diving, underwater archaeology, and coral monitoring to young people. There are some requirements to participate: getting good grades at school, learning to cook a Caribbean meal as a part of cultural preservation, carrying out beach cleaning, becoming a sea ambassador and fully participating in the centre’s activities. “As sea ambassadors, we bring to the earth what’s hidden under the water,” says Anumí, 18. She has just finished high school and has enrolled for an oceanographic university degree. In the future, she hopes to run a project to protect sharks, her favourite animal. “When I was little, I expressed my frustrations to my grandfather. I complained about the selfishness of people who didn’t want to give up their habits that are detrimental to the planet. Then I got involved in the centre, and it became a family to me.” During the pandemic, with schools closed and online lessons not accessible to all, the centre became increasingly important for the young divers. “During the lockdown, when all the activities stopped, we saw more corals and animals than ever: also the seahorses were back,” says Ana María. Through constant coral monitoring, they were able to correct the local misconception that the reef was dead due to pollution. “Saying that the reef was dead was an excuse for not taking care of the ocean,” she says. “Also, companies took advantage of it and proposed projects of oil exploitation or dock constructions that we stopped over the years. Our constant monitoring showed that the reef was alive.” “The pandemic teaches us that the reef is not so fragile, it only needs better waters,” says Isaac Baldizón, a marine biologist, who works with the centre. Today, the team is working fast to avoid the storm looming on the horizon. After a quick 20-metre swim, the reef is under their flippers. Anumí and Ana María analyse the health and whitening of the corals, and Maitén and Salim count the fish, such as the reef cleaner, parrotfish, and the blue-spotted damselfish. Maitén, 14, and her fellow divers are also studying two wrecks, thought to be linked to the slave trade, that sank many years ago in nearby Cahuita bay. “As Afro-descendants, taking care of the sea means also discovering the past hidden in the abyss and giving voice to our roots,” says Maitén, who is interested in submarine archaeology. “The vessels have always been there. Old people considered them as pirate legends,” says Maitén. “In August, Ghana’s Ashanti king came to Puerto Viejo. He did an emotional ritual above the wrecks to honour the memory of enslaved Africans who were shipwrecked off the Caribbean coast more than 300 years ago. I was moved to tears.” The study of the wrecks, thought by some to be the remains of two Danish ships carrying enslaved people in the early 18th century, will continue next spring. In the meantime, the divers dream of having a new headquarters, Casa del Mar [Sea House], to welcome visitors and children from the community. For the moment, they use Esteban’s patio to unload the equipment, as they are doing today when the tropical storm ends the coral monitoring. “Casa del Mar will be the place to bring on land the voice of the sea and the stories of our ancestors,” says Anumí. “Our headquarters will be there for the next generations: we dream about an entire community of sea ambassadors.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment, Coral crusaders: Costa Rica’s young divers learn to protect their seas,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/27/coral-crusaders-costa-ricas-young-divers-learn-to-protect-their-seas-aoe
1/27/2022,"Leading climate scientists have ridiculed and criticised comments made by controversial Canadian psychologist and author Jordan Peterson during an interview on Joe Rogan’s podcast. During a new four-hour interview on Spotify’s most popular podcast, Peterson – who is not an expert on climate change – claimed that models used to forecast the future state of the climate couldn’t be relied on.  Peterson told Rogan that because the climate was so complex, it couldn’t be accurately modelled. He said: “Another problem that bedevils climate modelling, too, which is that as you stretch out the models across time, the errors increase radically. And so maybe you can predict out a week or three weeks or a month or a year, but the farther out you predict, the more your model is in error. “And that’s a huge problem when you’re trying to model over 100 years because the errors compound just like interest.” Peterson said that if the climate was “about everything” then “your models aren’t right” because they couldn’t include everything. But climate scientists have described Peterson’s comments as “stunningly ignorant” and said he had fundamentally misunderstood the concept of climate modelling. Dr Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales Canberra, said Peterson’s description of how climate models work was fundamentally wrong. While weather forecasts do become less accurate the further out they go, this was a different process to climate modelling. “He seems to think we model the future climate the same way we do the weather. He sounds intelligent, but he’s completely wrong. “He has no frickin’ idea,” she said. The backlash from scientists comes as Spotify removes the music of veteran songwriter Neil Young after the singer issued an ultimatum to the company. Young was furious at what he described as “misinformation” spread on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast about the Covid-19 pandemic. Rogan’s show has previously aired claims by a different guest that hospitals are financially incentivised to falsely diagnose deaths as having been caused by Covid-19 and that world leaders had hypnotised the public into supporting vaccines. “They can have Rogan or Young. Not both,” Young wrote in a letter to his management. According to Spotify, which paid US$100m for exclusive rights to Rogan’s podcast in 2020, the platform has 381 million users and 172 million subscribers. Rogan tops the platform’s podcast charts in the UK, USA and Australia. Dr Gavin Schmidt, a climate modeller and senior adviser at Nasa, said on Twitter: “Guys, for the love of everything holy, please, please, have somebody on who knows what the heck a climate model is!!!” Schmidt told the Guardian he was reminded of a quote from the famous British statistician George Box. “Peterson has managed to absorb the first part of George Box’s famous dictum that ‘all models are wrong’ but appears to have not worked out the second part ‘but some are useful’,” Schmidt said. Guys, for the love of everything holy, please, please, have somebody on who knows what the heck a climate model is!!! @joerogan https://t.co/VQ8GmH4vvE Prof Steve Sherwood, of the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, said Peterson was “making the ancient climate sceptic error of mixing up weather and climate”. “Anyone who has taken an introductory course in climate or atmospheric science would spot this problem,” he said. “Errors in a weather forecast indeed accumulate such that after a couple of weeks the forecast is useless.” But with climate, Sherwood said, the models work differently to project how the climate will respond to different factors, such as higher levels of CO2. “[Peterson’s] argument is like saying we can’t predict whether a pot of water on a flame will boil, because we decide in advance what variables to put in our model, and can’t predict each bubble.” Sherwood said the “laws of thermodynamics and some basic calculations” are enough to give scientists confidence in projections. Prof Christian Jakob, a climate modelling expert at Monash University, said Peterson’s comments were “ill-informed” and that he’d “mixed up weather prediction with climate projections. “People are entitled to their opinions, but science and climate modelling isn’t about opinion. If you’re not well informed about how something is done then it’s not right to make comments about it on a large platform.” Holy moly. I don't think I can do this. First words out of Peterson's mouth in the Joe Rogan interview are complete self parody. I can't even dunk on it. pic.twitter.com/hIDYPi0KDc Prof Michael Mann, an atmospheric scientist at Penn State University, said Peterson’s comments – and Rogan’s facilitation of them – was an “almost comedic type of nihilism” that would be funny if it wasn’t so dangerous. Peterson’s claim that the climate was too complicated showed “a total lack of understanding of how science works” and could be used to dismiss physics, chemistry, biology, “and every other field of science where one formulates conceptual models”, according to Mann. “Every great discovery in science – including the physics that allowed Peterson and Rogan to record and broadcast their ridiculous conversation – has arisen through that process,” he said. For what its worth, we have been projecting future warming since the first climate models in the late 1960s/early 1970s. We can look back to see how well they have performed. It turns out our models generally did a good job: https://t.co/xxi1BgiDO0 pic.twitter.com/Ehan82kHFc Prof John Abraham, a climate scientist at the University of St Thomas in Minnesota, said the episode was “a word salad of nonsense spoken by people who have no sense when it comes to climate.” “To say that climate model errors increase like compound interest is laughable.

1/27/2022,"The federal government’s announcement that it has “freed” the Aboriginal flag is misleading and has been seriously misinterpreted, according to the company which still holds the exclusive licence to make Aboriginal flags for sale. “All is not what it appears,” according to Carroll & Richardson Flagworld, which is challenging reports about the government’s $20m deal to acquire copyright of the flag design and buy out some of the licences to reproduce it, which were previously held by non-Indigenous companies.  “The government’s announcement is misleading and confusing and does not ‘free the flag’ except for its use on clothing, badges, pins etc, or its reproduction in digital formats and on playing surfaces,” Wayne Gregory, the managing director of Carroll & Richardson Flagworld, said in a statement. Gregory told Guardian Australia the announcement had confused the community. “As far as the flag’s concerned, it’s really business as usual. The only difference is the royalties will be paid to the government, which the government’s already indicated they’re going to use to fund programs for Naidoc, which is perfectly acceptable,” he said. “But what they’ve done is created the illusion that everything’s going to be free.” A Morrison government spokesperson said its media release announcing that the flag design would be freely available did acknowledge Flagworld’s continuing licence for the commercial production of flags and bunting – but this may not have been widely reported. “We appreciate Flagworld’s concern that the details of their continuing world-wide exclusive licence have not been widely reported by the media,” the spokesperson said. But they did not address Flagworld’s claims that the Coalition had misled the public by saying the flag was now “free.” The Monday release quoted the prime minister, Scott Morrison, as saying: “We’ve freed the Aboriginal flag for Australians.” “Throughout the negotiations, we have sought to protect the integrity of the Aboriginal flag, in line with Harold Thomas’ wishes. I thank everyone involved for reaching this outcome, putting the flag in public hands.” It has struck a $20m deal to assume copyright of the design from its creator, Luritja artist Harold Thomas, after two-and-a-half years of “extremely complicated” negotiations. Questions have since been asked about its future custodianship now that copyright rests with the commonwealth, as well as how much of the $20m was paid to the non-Indigenous businesses involved, WAM Clothing and Gifts Mate, both companies associated with Gold Coast businessman Ben Wooster. Wooster’s previous company, Birubi Arts, was fined $2.3m by the federal court after it was found to have breached consumer law by selling fake Aboriginal art. Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy and Greens senator Lidia Thorpe, who were part of a select committee which examined the status of the Aboriginal flag in 2020, have both said they intend to ask the government for more details about the deal at the next Senate estimates hearings in February. Campaigners who fought to “free” the Aboriginal flag have said previously that while questions remain about its future custodianship, the current arrangement is “as good as we’re going to get in terms of freeing the Aboriginal flag”. “My grandkids, my great-grandkids, will have the Aboriginal flag in their lives, uniting them and supporting their culture and making them feel safe in community,” Laura Thompson, convenor of the #freetheflag campaign, said on Tuesday. The #freetheflag movement began after Thompson’s business, Clothing the Gaps, was served with a cease and desist notice from WAM. Thompson said it was a relief that private companies were now “out of the picture” but some questions remained. “The fact that the Aboriginal flag was controlled, and privately owned, is just absurd,” she said. In 1995, the governor general proclaimed it along with the Torres Strait Islander flag. Other claimants came forward asserting they were the artist behind, it but in 1997 the federal court officially recognised Thomas as the sole author, giving him the ability to assign licences. By 2019, amid mounting distress and confusion over who was able to use the design freely, a parliamentary inquiry was set up to look into the copyright and licensing arrangements. Its final report labelled WAM Clothing’s actions as “heavy-handed”. Wyatt told ABC Radio on Tuesday that “the benefits in the long term far outweigh what we expended”. “It’s about giving back the flag to be freely used,” he said. The image of the flag can be reproduced on websites, on apparel such as sports jerseys and shirts, in paintings and other artworks, used digitally and in any other medium without having to ask for permission or pay a fee. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Gregory said he has already noticed a rise in online merchandise, some of it “shoddy”, featuring the flag design. He is concerned there may be more to come now that the assumption is that the flag is “free”. “Too many things get butchered these days, get pirated, and this flag is far too important to be treated the way many other products are. So we’ve sought to close down as many people as we can who do it,” Gregory said. “But that’s the confusing message and I don’t think the government helped because most of the quotes were all about freeing everything. And that’s … potentially misleading.”",News/Australia news,Company that retains exclusive rights to make Aboriginal flags says Coalition has ‘misled’ community,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/27/company-that-retains-exclusive-right-to-make-aboriginal-flags-says-government-has-misled-community
1/27/2022,"Not parallel actually: that would mean they don’t touch. Here we have convergent mothers; intersecting mothers whose lives come together with a spark that ignites this moving melodrama, which audaciously draws a line between love, sex, the passionate courage of single mothers, the meaning of Lorca’s Doña Rosita the Spinster and the unhealed wound of Spain’s fascist past. Pedro Almódovar’s new movie has the warmth and the grandiloquent flair of a picture from Hollywood’s golden age (something starring Bette Davis and Joan Fontaine maybe, with music by Max Steiner) and the whiplash twists and addictive sugar rush bumps of daytime soap. As ever with Almódovar, there are gorgeously designed interiors with fierce, thick blocks of Mondrian colour, huge closeups of the female leads and overhead shots of food preparation. It’s impossible to watch this film without just feeling grateful that its director is still so fluent, so creative, still making us a gift of these films. There is a lot going on here, and perhaps the emotions and thoughts spill over the edges of its narrative form. But it would be obtuse not to let yourself travel downstream on this film’s emotional surge.  One mother is Janis, played by Penélope Cruz, a stylish photographer in her late 30s whose agent is the worldly Elena (Almódovar’s totemic regular Rossy de Palma). The other mother is Ana (Milena Smit), a serious-looking teenager whose family background is troubled. These heavily pregnant women share a hospital room and bond over their decision to go it alone. The father of Janis’s child is Arturo (Israel Elejalde), an anthropologist working with the historical unit formed under Spain’s historical memory law, tracing people murdered by Francoists during the civil war and buried in unmarked mass graves; Janis believes that her great-grandfather was one such victim. The two women’s newborns are whisked away for observational reasons at the same time. But when Janis gets her baby home, events conspire to plant a seed of doubt in her mind: she orders a DNA test online, which means a swab test weirdly similar to the one Arturo carries out on the recovered bodies at the gravesite. The disquieting results mean that Janis has to get back in touch with Ana and re-establish their remarkable relationship. The facts of the narrative make it sound contrived and implausible. Yet the sheer poetic conviction means that there is no problem believing that the personal is the political and that history, the future and the present are as one. Baby-swap dramas are nothing new: there was Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Like Father, Like Son from 2013, and the famous case from the 1930s of a British woman, Margaret Wheeler, who famously appealed to George Bernard Shaw for help when she suspected her baby had been muddled up with someone else’s at the hospital. But Parallel Mothers is superior to any of them in the way it springs tragedy on audiences expecting comedy. And the film allows you to ponder not just the mother-child bond – strong enough to confront fascism – but the way everyone has to let their children be influenced by strangers; the unintended upbringing of being out in the world. What an emotional experience.  Parallel Mothers is released on 28 January in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Parallel Mothers review | Peter Bradshaw's film of the week,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/27/parallel-mothers-review-pedro-almodovar
1/27/2022,"I’ve never used the expression “casting pearls before swine”; in fact, I’ve just had to look up exactly what it means. I’m therefore neither surprised nor upset that it seems to be falling out of common use. Of the 2,000 people aged between 18 and 50 surveyed by the research agency Perspectus Global, 78%, like me, had never uttered it. Next on the list, disappointingly, is the, to my mind, rather useful “nailing one’s colours to a mast”, tied at 71% with “colder than a witch’s tit”, which I’ve neither liked nor found a use for – just like “pip pip”, in fourth place. It is to be hoped that while these things will fall in and out of favour, our language will always be rich with them. At their best they’re poetic, at least in the sense that their meaning might need a moment’s thought.  Allow me to share some personal favourites. Only the other day, a friend of mine with a strong Swansea accent described something as “wet as an otter’s pocket”. Excellent. Another one I heard once and have used ever since relates to suddenly finding oneself in an environment where there are many people to whom you’re sexually attracted.

For the last month I’ve been in Italy where a “super green pass” is required for access to public transport and all indoor public spaces, but it expires 270 days after the last vaccination. My second jab, last April, is now invalid. I’ve been trying since November to get this resolved. The NHS website directed me to 119, which referred me to the Vaccine Data Resolution Service (VDRS). It was supposed to ring me within three weeks. Six weeks on, I’m still waiting, but the 119 number doesn’t work from Italy. I have had to cancel all future social and business arrangements and I am concerned that I may not even be able to access the airport to fly home. I cannot be the only one caught up in this.MT, London Indeed you are not, which is why the VDRS was set up for patients registered to an English GP who received their jab in England. NHS England wouldn’t comment on whether it’s struggling with a backlog of incomplete vaccine records, but in an email to you a caseworker explained that demand had been higher than expected.  The trouble is, patients can’t contact the VDRS directly. They call the 119 number which, as you’ve found, is inaccessible from overseas, and the NHS advice page on updating a vaccine record gives no alternative. Nor is there the option for you to log your details online. The VDRS pledges to attempt to make contact up to three times within 21 days, and expects the person to have vaccine dates, batch numbers and the full address of the vaccine centre at the ready when the call comes. You were contacted by an agent after I intervened and, three months after your booster jab, your pass was updated. The NHS says: “Staff are working hard to resolve all issues as quickly and efficiently as possible.” The telephone number for overseas callers is +44 151 905 0119 and anyone facing delays can complain to england.contactus@nhs.net. Incidentally, Britons planning to travel within the EU may be unaware that, from 1 February, they will be deemed unvaccinated if their second jab was more than 270 days ago, and have not received a booster.

1/27/2022,"The first few days of Stella Nyanzi’s new life in Germany have not been without their challenges, from navigating the TV and internet in a different language to finding the right school for her three teenagers. On the second day, the family went shopping for clothes – “thick jackets, mittens and scarves” – to see them through the fierce Bavarian winter. For her 14-year-old twins, who have lived their whole lives in sub-Saharan Africa and who insisted on wearing Crocs with no socks on the flight over, the sub-zero temperatures were a rude awakening. At the centre of it all, however, has been deep sense of relief. Nyanzi, a 47-year-old outspoken scholar, poet and human rights advocate whose irreverent writing about Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, has seen her jailed twice, decided enough was enough. She has been accepted on a writers-in-exile programme run by PEN Germany, and has no intention of returning to Uganda while the 77-year-old Museveni is in power. And while there are many concerns about how she and her children are going to settle into Munich life, the sense of freedom is powering her on.  “Because I’m very much a free-thinking, loud-mouthed, crass woman who boldly speaks her mind, I think one of the greatest joys is to be able to criticise Museveni’s dictatorship and not fear for my life,” she says. “To not have thick-voiced men breathing down my telephone. And to be threatened online, but to know that the threats won’t reach me, is really relieving. I know it’s going to be difficult [with regards to] the practicalities. But, Jesus, the sense of freedom! The freedom from fear of retribution and reprisal and punishment, simply because one refuses to only praise the dictatorship, is to die for. “I can suffer the winter and the cold and the hard language – and the food is a bit different. But it’s freedom. You know: I am free at least. My children don’t have to fear that they’ll have more nights with mama in prison or locked up in a police cell simply because I wrote a Facebook post or I wrote too harshly about a dictator who is begging to be written harshly about. So that’s freedom from fear, much more than freedom to do. Freedom to be is, like, immediate relief.” This week, the international spotlight has been on another critic of Uganda’s dictator, novelist Kakwenza Rukirabashaija, whose book The Greedy Barbarian was seen as a satire of Museveni’s Uganda. Rukirabashaija, 33, was charged earlier this month with “offensive communication” over tweets about the six-term president and his son. For two weeks, he was held in detention in an undisclosed location before he was released on bail. His lawyer says he was tortured. Rukirabashaija’s case is not unfamiliar to Nyanzi. The former university lecturer went to prison for a month in 2017 after referring to Museveni as “a pair of buttocks”, and for nearly 16 months the year after, for writing a poem that described his mother’s vagina in a variety of grotesque ways. (“Yoweri, they say it was your birthday yesterday./ How painfully ugly a day!/ I wish the lice-filled bush of dirty pubic hair overgrown all over Esiteri’s unwashed chuchu had strangled you at birth./ Strangled you just like the long tentacles of corruption you sowed and watered into our bleeding economy.”) Nyanzi had tried to leave Uganda for Kenya in January 2021, after losing her bid to be elected as Kampala’s women’s representative. But, stymied by red tape, she returned home within months, trying to keep a low profile. Then, at the end of December, Rukirabashaija was detained, the doors of his home broken down by gunmen who whisked him away. “And I thought: fuck the silence,” Nyanzi says, speaking by telephone from Munich. “We cannot keep quiet in the face of such brutality. And I began to agitate again.” In response, she says, the threats and intimidating messages started to return. For anyone who has seen her bare her breasts in protest at a jail sentence or exit that jail clad in a tiara and sash declaring “FUCK OPPRESSION”, it is hard to imagine Nyanzi ever not being a political activist. But, she says, it was only in recent years that she found her cause. Her first show of dissent was a naked protest at university. From then she embraced the anti-colonial Ugandan tradition of “radical rudeness” as a tool against oppression. It is, she says, highly effective, particularly from an otherwise respectable mother and university academic. “People have said to me: perhaps radical rudeness will not oust Museveni. And I say: perhaps the intention is not to use rude poetry and big breasts in public to oust Museveni; perhaps the idea is to invite others to be able to poke holes in this huge over-glorification of a mighty, untouchable demigod and, if many of us are poking small holes, perhaps the mighty trunk of the tree will fall. I don’t know.” She adds: “Many do not approve. But I’m not looking for approval.” When she went to Kenya in 2021, there was a backlash from fellow opposition critics who accused her of “leaving the battlefield” before the fight was won, and she anticipates similar censure now. But, after years of vigorous participation in the struggle, she thinks it is time for her to prioritise her children. Moreover, she feels freer to criticise Museveni from the safety of Germany. For the president, then, there is unlikely to be any letup. “Now that I’m out of the country, there’s a bigger onus on me … to write and speak out and use my voice,” she says. The Writers in Exile programme, funded by the German government, runs for up to three years. Some – but by no means all – of its participants go on to claim political asylum in the country. Does Nyanzi believe she will ever go back? “Uganda is my home. I have booked to be buried beside my father in our village,” she says. “We have a beautiful equatorial sun; we don’t have winter and snow. We have sweet pineapples and sweet bananas; we don’t have frozen foods. We pick mangoes from the trees and eat them. I’d like to go back to that and live like that, but I also don’t want my children to sleep on their own at night because their mother is in a prison cell simply because she writes a poem about Museveni.” She adds: “I hope to return because I have work to do in Uganda … I want to make a change, contribute towards building the new Uganda post-Museveni. However, I do not want to go and live in fear simply because I’m being myself … I don’t want to kill the voice inside of me. As long as it’s dangerous to speak out, as long as it’s dangerous to write freely, I don’t want to be in Uganda.”",News/Global development,"‘I’m free at last’: Uganda’s rudest poet on prison, protest and finding a new voice in Germany",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/27/im-free-at-last-ugandas-rudest-poet-stella-nyanzi-on-prison-protest-and-finding-new-voice-in-germany
1/27/2022,"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas may “perpetuate a number of dangerous inaccuracies and fallacies” when used in teaching young people about the Holocaust, an academic report has said. According to research by the Centre for Holocaust Education at University College London, more than a third of teachers in England use the bestselling book and film adaptation in lessons on the Nazi genocide.  A study, to be published shortly, builds on research conducted five years ago among secondary school pupils which found that the story by John Boyne regularly elicited misplaced sympathy for Nazis. According to the new survey, 35% of teachers used The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas in lessons. However, its use occupies a “somewhat contested position as a potential educational resource”, the centre’s report says. Drama and English teachers were more likely to use it than history teachers. Boyne’s book is about a friendship between the son of an Auschwitz commandant and a Jewish boy incarcerated in the Nazi concentration camp. Published in 2006, it has sold more than 11m copies worldwide. A film version was made in 2008. The centre’s report said: “While most young people who took part in the study recognised the narrative as a work of fiction and many were able to identify and critique its most glaring implausibilities and historical inaccuracies, they nonetheless overwhelmingly characterised it as ‘realistic’ and/or ‘truthful’.” It added that many students, after studying the story, reached conclusions that “contributed significantly to one of the most powerful and problematic misconceptions of this history, that ‘ordinary Germans’ held little responsibility and were by and large ‘brainwashed’ or otherwise entirely ignorant of the unfolding atrocities”. Among comments from teachers gathered during the research were, “students come to us and literally think the Holocaust IS The Boy In the Striped Pyjamas”; “They come with … ideas that nobody knew about the Holocaust, that people were completely in the dark about it”; and “They feel sorry for the German guard”. Stuart Foster, the centre’s executive director, said he had no criticism of Boyne for his work of fiction, but using the novel in lessons about a historical event could be problematic. “In an era of fake news and conspiracy theories, it’s very worrying that young people harbour myths and misconceptions about the Holocaust.” Boyne, who has previously defended his work from similar criticism, told the Guardian: “The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is deliberately sub-titled ‘A Fable’, a work of fiction with a moral at the centre. From the start, I hoped it would inspire young people to begin their own study of the Holocaust, which in my case began at the age of 15 and continued in the decades that followed. “As a novelist, I believe that fiction can play a valuable role in introducing difficult subjects to young readers, but it is the job of the teacher to impress upon their students that there is legitimate space between imagination and reality. By relating to my central characters, however, by caring about them and wanting no harm to come to them, the young reader can learn empathy and kindness. “While no work of fiction is flawless, I remain extremely proud of The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas and grateful to the millions of readers who have embraced it over the last 16 years.”",News/World news,The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas fuels ‘dangerous’ Holocaust fallacies,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/27/the-boy-in-the-striped-pyjamas-fuels-dangerous-holocaust-fallacies
1/27/2022,"For a while on the first morning of the women’s Ashes Test in Canberra, England had the match firmly in their hands. Then those same hands let it slip, dropping catches in the cordon from Meg Lanning and Rachael Haynes before they both went close to making centuries. By stumps, the score was a hefty 327 for 7. England captain Heather Knight was sure from years of Big Bash experience that the surface at Manuka Oval would be good for batting throughout the full four days. Confident that any assistance for bowlers would come at the start of the match, she chose to field on winning the toss.  Initially, it worked. Long-time attack leaders Katherine Brunt and Anya Shrubsole found significant swing and got movement off the pitch, with Brunt drawing Alyssa Healy’s edge from a loose drive for a duck before Shrubsole found the edge of Beth Mooney’s defensive push for three. Mooney was playing despite a recently broken jaw, but her courage was not rewarded with Australia’s score at 4-2. The bigger dismissal came when Ellyse Perry top-edged a pull shot from Natalie Sciver on 18. From the Ashes Test in 2017 until that moment, Perry had made 492 Test runs for a solitary dismissal. As wicketkeeper Amy Jones ran around to backward square leg to tumble for her third catch, Perry was out for 18, and Australia were 43 for 3. Just before lunch, England had the chance to seize the Test. Left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone came on for a solitary over, turning the ball away from the right-hander. Lanning offered an outside edge to the left of Knight at slip, who got hands to the regulation chance but deflected it. Lanning would have been out for 14, the score would have been 78 for 4, and the session would have been undoubtedly England’s. Instead, given Australia’s deep batting, honours were fairly even. In the second session Haynes was given two reprieves, first by Shrubsole running around a possible catch at mid-on instead of attacking it, then by Sciver half-diving to her left at second slip for a thick edge off Brunt at a comfortable height. Haynes was on 42 for the first error, 44 for the second, and until that point had been taking on the bowling especially through point while her partners had struggled. Shrubsole produced a good spell to Lanning, finding inside and outside edges while swinging the ball in at the pads. But most everything else went Australia’s way as Lanning and Haynes batted through the session and raised half-centuries, with Lanning passing her curiously low Test best of 57. Ecclestone has become England’s major weapon, but dropped short consistently and was punished on the cut and the pull. Likewise Kate Cross, who drew Lanning’s edge on a couple of occasions but also offered fodder for her strength through point. Off-spinner Charlie Dean on debut produced nice flight and occasional turn but rarely looked threatening, though Knight used a DRS review for a Lanning sweep that could have been gloved to slip or out leg before wicket, but was neither. By tea Lanning was 84 and Haynes 82, and Australia were cruising at 199 for 3. The third session saw England come to life for a moment. Sciver’s outswinger had Lanning driving on 93 for Knight to take a diving catch at a wide slip, ending the partnership on 169. Three balls later, Brunt got a ball to rocket off the surface at Haynes, surprising the left-hander into gloving a catch to Jones on 86. Australia had new players in Tahlia McGrath and Ash Gardner at the crease. They were happy to take the game on though, with Gardner hooking the first six of the match and both players driving powerfully down the ground and square, especially facing spin. Gardner raced to 50 from 63 balls before Brunt trapped her lbw for 56, while McGrath reached 52 via a successful lbw review against Shrubsole and another drop at point by Sophia Dunkley. Sciver got McGrath’s edge from the last ball of the day for Jones to take a fifth catch, but Australia will resume with capable batters in Annabel Sutherland and Jess Jonassen, while England will be wondering what might have been.",Sport/Sport,Honours even after England let slip early advantage on day one of Women’s Ashes Test,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/27/honours-even-after-england-let-slip-early-advantage-on-day-one-of-womens-ashes-test
1/27/2022,"Hello, Warren Murray taking you on a quick scroll through the news.  Unemployed workers will be forced to take up a job in any sector within four weeks or face losing part of their universal credit, ministers have announced. The Way to Work campaign was flagged up by an embattled Boris Johnson at prime minister’s questions, with the opposition calling it out as an attempt to distract from his political woes. It is pitched as an initiative to get 500,000 people into work by June and fill 1.2m job vacancies nationally. Welfare experts said it would be counterproductive, forcing people into worse jobs and damaging careers. “The government is right that people need and deserve good jobs, but these will not be delivered by compelling people to seek any work, and against a context of continuing in-work poverty,” said Ruth Patrick from the University of York. The National Audit Office has found no evidence that benefit sanctions achieve their goal of pushing people into jobs. Numbers build against PM – A new raft of senior Conservative MPs are poised to send letters of no confidence in Boris Johnson when the long-awaited “partygate” report is published. Among those prepared to move against Johnson are more than two dozen out of 70 former ministers, according to Tory rebels’ calculations. There has been no official explanation for why Sue Gray’s report has not yet been sent to Johnson. On Wednesday night the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, indicated on ITV’s Peston that it might not be out until next week. Police will ask aides of Johnson who end up being named in Gray’s report whether they are guilty over the lockdown parties and will accept a fine under regulations passed by the government they work for. Biden to make his mark on court – Joe Biden has been gifted the opportunity to change the political narrative around his administration with a supreme court justice set to retire. The expected departure of Justice Stephen Breyer will allow the president to fulfil his promise to make the first ever appointment of a black woman to the bench. After a year in the White House, Biden has been limping with a stalled legislative agenda, tenacious pandemic and Vladimir Putin threatening Ukraine. Although the ideological balance of the court will not change, Biden could choose a young liberal who will serve for decades. Nuclear option – Ministers have thrown a further £100m behind EDF Energy’s £20bn Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk. The government will have rights to an equity stake in the development company behind the project, and over the site. If EDF is able to secure enough investor backing to make a final decision on Sizewell, it would reimburse the government with a stake in the project or in cash. It is understood that EDF and the UK government also hope to secure enough new investment to replace Chinese state-controlled CGN, which has a 20% stake. Sizewell, which is still going through planning and development, would power 6 million homes, but has been plagued by opposition from local campaigners, fears over its price tag and China’s involvement. Pipe crimped if Russia invades – The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between Russia and Germany will not be switched on if Russia invades Ukraine, the US state department has said. The pipeline bypasses the traditional transit route through Ukraine. It has faced resistance within the EU for its potential to make Europe too directly reliant on Russian gas. In a letter to the Russian regime, the US has repeated its commitment to upholding the “open-door” policy to countries like Ukraine joining Nato, while offering a “principled and pragmatic evaluation” of the Kremlin’s concerns, said the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken. Britain and other Nato allies are considering a request from the US to deploy hundreds more troops to support member countries in eastern Europe in advance of any Russian invasion or attack on Ukraine. Uni diversity – Black and Asian students won places at prestigious UK universities at record levels in 2021, rising by 19% in a year, alongside increasing numbers of students from all backgrounds, and the chief executive of the Ucas admissions service has said there could be 1 million applications for places by 2026. The record numbers of applications and acceptances were driven by the rise in higher A-levels awarded in 2021 after the government’s decision to cancel exams and replace them with teacher-assessed grades. The boost in results and rising numbers of 18-year-olds in the UK population saw more applicants awarded places across the board, with 492,005 students accepted on to a course. With diplomatic talks at an apparent impasse, Vladimir Putin seems prepared to start a war. Andrew Roth reports from Moscow.

Australia have made a strong start in the women’s Ashes under way at Canberra’s Manuka Oval – Rachael Haynes (86) and Meg Lanning (93) leading the charge. Australia were 317-6 just now going into the last 10 overs of the day. Nicholas Pooran and Rovman Powell have blasted West Indies to a 20-run victory over England in their third T20 at Kensington Oval in Barbados. In football’s Africa Cup of Nations, Egypt have beaten Ivory Coast on penalties after a 0-0 draw, as Mohamed Salah’s decisive spot-kick was enough for Egypt to progress. Professional female footballers in England are to benefit from maternity and long-term sickness cover in a landmark change to their contracts. The Six Nations chief executive, Ben Morel, has denied that Italy’s dismal recent record is damaging the credibility of the tournament and kept the door shut on South Africa joining Europe’s premier rugby event. Robert Kitson writes that it is shaping up as a wonderfully poised and evenly matched tournament. Asian shares have plunged today after the US Federal Reserve signalled it is on course to make fighting inflation a priority this year by raising interest rates. The prospect of more costly borrowing has unnerved markets but the confirmation of Fed intentions saw heavy losses in Japan, South Korea and Australia. The FTSE100 is tracking for a hefty drop of almost 2% at the opening while the pound is on $1.343 and €1.197. Meanwhile, private rents in Britain have risen at their fastest on record, piling pressure on household finances. Our Guardian print edition leads with “PM accused of lying over rescue of animals during fall of Kabul”. New Foreign Office emails appear to contradict Boris Johnson’s insistence he did not authorise the rescue of cats and dogs from a British charity in Afghanistan during the fall of Kabul. In the picture slot, the food writer and activist Jack Monroe hails the new way that official inflation will be calculated, to account for a wider range of income levels and household circumstances. On the third-edition front page we also have “Andrew demands trial by jury in US”. The Duke of York has denied he was a co-conspirator of Jeffrey Epstein and insisted on a jury trial in Virginia Giuffre’s sexual abuse lawsuit against him, his lawyers said in court papers filed on Wednesday. On that latter story the Mirror says “Andrew: I’ll face a sex trial jury” while the Sun has “Andrew: I’ll go to trial … no sweat”. It’s also on the front of the Mail, which says the duke has issued 41 denials over sex claims, but the paper’s lead is “Tory MPs tell Boris: spike tax hike and we’ll back you”. It’s the other way round in the Express, which has as its lead “Andrew shock: I want jury trial” while Boris Johnson gets a full-width picture and the supportive headline “Party rallies behind Boris” – presumably meaning the Conservative party, not another accidental booze-up or cake ambush. The Express has “Andrew: it’s trial by jury” while the Financial Times leads with “ECB warns Europe’s banks over risks in Russia-Ukraine sanctions”. The Telegraph says “National insurance rise will push up prices, PM warned”. And the front-page lead in the Times is “Shops and trains stick to masks as plan B ends”.
