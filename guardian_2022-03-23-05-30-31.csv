3/23/2022,"Paul Canoville, the first black footballer to play for Chelsea, has increased the pressure on the Ricketts family by becoming the latest figure to speak out against their attempt to buy the club. The owners of the Chicago Cubs flew to London for talks with influential supporters on Tuesday and are confident they will make it to the next stage of the bidding process. The Ricketts have plenty of financial clout after partnering with Ken Griffin, a billionaire hedge fund tycoon, and believe their experience of renovating Chicago’s iconic Wrigley Field stadium proves they are strong candidates to buy Chelsea from Roman Abramovich. However the bid has faced a huge backlash on social media after it emerged that Joe Ricketts, the family’s patriarch, was accused of Islamophobia three years ago. A #NoToRicketts campaign has been trending on Twitter and there has also been criticism of how the Ricketts have run the Cubs, even though the baseball side won the World Series in 2016. Brian Wolff, the head of the Chelsea Chicago Supporters’ Club, has said the bid has been met “with universal disdain” in his city and the Ricketts have now attracted negative attention from one of the most important figures in Chelsea’s history. Canoville, an anti-racism campaigner, tweeted: “So I’ve seen and heard enough. I’m backing @ChelseaSTrust and saying a big fat anti racism NO to the Ricketts bid!!” Chelsea supporters voiced alarm after it emerged Joe Ricketts wrote “Muslims are naturally my (our) enemy due to their deep antagonism and bias against non-Muslims” in an email exchange in 2019. Fans pointed out that Thomas Tuchel’s squad contains several Muslim players. However, it is understood Joe Ricketts, who apologised for his comments at the time and insisted he did not hold bigoted views, is not part of the bid. In 2019 Tom Ricketts, the face of the bid for Chelsea, distanced himself from the comments and said his father was not involved with the Cubs. The family has also sought to make amends with Chicago’s Muslim community. The Ricketts remain firm in their belief that their bid for Chelsea will succeed. They have spoken with Greg Hands, the MP for Chelsea and Fulham, and intend to meet with Chelsea Pitch Owners PLC to discuss a rebuild of Stamford Bridge. The Chelsea Supporters’ Trust has said that it will continue to “reaffirm that any new owner must share the inclusive values of Chelsea FC and its diverse fanbase”. Other candidates to own Chelsea include a consortium fronted by Todd Boehly, Jonathan Goldstein and Hansjörg Wyss; Nick Candy; Sir Martin Broughton and Lord Coe; the Saudi Media Group; and Woody Johnson.",Sport/Football,Ex-Chelsea player Paul Canoville speaks out against Ricketts family bid for club,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/22/ex-chelsea-player-paul-canoville-speaks-out-against-ricketts-family-bid-for-club
3/23/2022,"Good morning. The impact of the Russian invasions of Ukraine on food prices, combined with cost of living rises, is being felt by Australians as the war enters its 28th day. Families in China are still waiting on information about what caused a plane with 132 people on board to crash. Russian forces have “kidnapped” more than 2,300 children from the Russian-controlled territories of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts and taken them to Russia, according to the US embassy. Russian forces are now inside the besieged southern city of Mariupol, a senior US defence official said. More than 200,000 people are trapped there and Ukraine’s government has begged Vladimir Putin to let civilians leave the city, where the situation has been described as a “freezing hellscape riddled with dead bodies and destroyed buildings” by Human Rights Watch. Australian businesses finding their feet after the Covid crisis are now struggling with food price hikes, and are faced with the dilemma of whether they can pass the rising costs to customers and remain competitive. One cafe owner says the price of coffee alone has risen by $6,500 a year, another says raw ingredients are setting her back an additional $20,000 a year. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused the price of wheat to soar to all-time records as the two countries are major food exporters. The Australian War Memorial is being pressed to stop accepting money from Lockheed Martin when its current sponsorship deal concludes next month, due to the company’s involvement in nuclear weapons and surging share price after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Veterans, historians and experts say companies that profit from conflict “have no place in a solemn memorial honouring people killed in the carnage of war”. Newcastle residents whose homes were showered in asbestos fragments after a warehouse fire this month say they are dismayed by the NSW government’s response to the disaster. They say they have been left in the dark about the cleanup and have only heard through social media that they were required to register for public works cleaning. Community and consumer groups are calling on the federal government to compensate victims of the Youpla Group’s collapse, which has left thousands of Indigenous Australian policyholders with nothing. The climate crisis is the greatest threat to the future and security of Australians and the country is unprepared for its increasingly harsh impacts, a group of defence leaders has warned. In an open letter they call on politicians to make climate a primary focus and “address this clear and present danger”. The outgoing Parramatta MP, Julie Owens, has expressed disappointment at Labor’s plans to parachute Andrew Charlton into her western Sydney seat, saying local branch preselections are “the way it should be”. Zachary Rolfe was investigated for perjury after a judge said he had lied about his actions during the violent arrest of an Aboriginal man in Alice Springs but police found there was insufficient evidence, newly released court documents show. Chinese state media report there have been no signs of survivors from the Chinese Eastern Airline plane that crashed into a remote bamboo forest in the mountains near Wuzhou with 132 people on board. ID cards and wallets have reportedly been found at the scene but the plane’s black box has yet to be located and the cause of the crash is not yet known. A patient with locked-in syndrome is communicating with his family after being implanted with a device that enables him to control a keyboard with his mind.

Several European countries lifted their Covid restrictions too soon, the World Health Organization has said, and as a result are now witnessing sharp rises in infections probably linked to the new, more transmissible Omicron BA2 subvariant. “I don’t want to brag but I have an amazing garlic crusher,” says the Australian singer Sarah Blasko in our weekly interview about objects. “Look, you might have something equally or indeed more impressive, but let me just say that growing up as I did, and then living in share houses, I didn’t even know that a garlic crusher of this calibre existed.” She also tells us about her disastrous NYC stay in Sia’s loft – and the guitar she found along the way. It was a given that the Australian spinoff of the US maritime reality show Below Deck would feature some local flair. “So when old news footage of a 45.6-metre yacht [series Captain Jason Chambers] was captaining was shown crashing into a marina, I was overjoyed,” writes Stephanie Van Schilt. “It was a perfect moment for an Australian spinoff of a popular US show: is there anything we love more than watching a slow-motion crash? And now we get one at our own marina.” The Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art, Australia’s longest running survey of contemporary art, has opened for 2022 – but under a shroud of sadness. The deaths of one of the exhibition’s key artists, Hossein Valamanesh, and the biennial’s principal sponsor, Neil Balnaves, have permeated the atmosphere. Their deaths have added a layer of poignancy to the 2022 event, titled Free/State, a celebratory and cerebral examination of human freedom. The final findings of the first national project to record mass killings on the Australian frontier have been released.

3/23/2022,"Russian artillery has unleashed a continuous bombardment on the port of Mariupol, reducing the besieged city to “ashes of a dead land”, Ukrainian officials said, as survivors described their escape past bodies piled up in the streets. The Donetsk governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, accused Vladimir Putin’s forces of indiscriminate fire on civilian areas, as local officials said two “super-powerful bombs” had struck amid efforts to rescue the remaining 100,000-200,000 civilians hiding in basements and shelters. A group of 780 terrified and traumatised men, women and children arrived in Lviv by rail on Tuesday afternoon with horrific stories of the devastation. Most were immediately put on coaches to Poland with food rations. One, Yulia Krytska, 42, said she would stay in Ukraine – but could never return home. “I want the world to know about Mariupol,” said Krytska who, with her husband and 12-year-old son, survived for days on shared scraps of food and dirty drinking water in the basement of a multi-storey building. As she spoke, a public address system in Lviv central station announced: announced: “Dear citizens of Mariupol – welcome to Lviv, you are safe now.” Hands trembling uncontrollably, and with tears in her eyes, Krytska spoke of the rotting corpses and endless shelling that had left “people without any hope of surviving”. “We got out by accident,” she said. “A volunteer shouted into the basement of the multi-storey building where we were hiding that there was a way out. His name is Maxim, that is all I know. People don’t have any food there. They have nothing. What we had we shared. They are dead people in the streets everywhere. They can’t take them away because of the shelling”. Krytska said that the Ukrainian police and army seemed to disappear once the bombing started, with only brief lulls of 30 minutes between hours of devastating blows that flattened every building. “It just kept coming,” she said. “As the bombs were dropping, we didn’t know where they were coming from. “It was unusually cold for Mariupol at this time of year and we were sharing whatever we had to keep warm in the basement. My son is traumatised. I want to stay here – but I don’t want to go home.” On Tuesday, a further convoy of 15 buses carrying 1,114 evacuees set off on a tense escape through the same route as Krytska through territory occupied by Russian forces to arrive at city of Zaporizhzhia. Officials said that there was fighting in the streets and that two heavy bombs had struck despite rescue efforts. “It is clear that the occupiers are not interested in the city of Mariupol, they want to raze it to the ground, to reduce it to ashes”, a local official said. From Zaporizhzhia, the evacuees faced a further 24-hour rail journey in packed trains to the relative safety of Lviv. “We didn’t care if we had to stand for 24 hours – we just wanted to be safe”, Krytska said. In a video address to the Italian parliament, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said of Mariupol: “There is nothing left there. Only ruins.” On a Telegram news feed used to share stories of Mariupol’s destruction, a picture of a note and scrawled map that had been left by a father for an absent son was posted. It said: “Dima, your mother died on 9 March 2022. She died quickly. The building burned down. Dima, I’m sorry I couldn’t save her. I buried your mother near the kindergarten. I love you.” The message could not be independently verified. Amid growing international condemnation, Greece’s foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, said Greece would seek to lead a humanitarian aid mission to the city with the help of the Red Cross. The development came as the US accused Russia of kidnapping 2,389 Ukrainian children from the separatist regions of Ukraine. The “illegally removed” children were said to have been taken from the Russian-controlled territories of Luhansk and Donetsk to Russia under the guise of a Kremlin-directed rescue mission. Moscow’s claims of a humanitarian effort were ridiculed in Ukraine and abroad as gruesome witness testimony from besieged Ukrainian cities emerged from the survivors. Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine’s prosecutor general, described the alleged kidnapping of children as a “gross violation of international law”. The US embassy in Kyiv tweeted: “This is not assistance. It is kidnapping.” Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said a convoy of 21 vehicles carrying humanitarian aid had been sent ahead to Zaporizhzhia, where evacuees from Mariupol were being initially bussed, with flour, food and medical supplies and that they would not leave anyone behind. Nearly 200 more people from Mariupol are expected to arrive in Lviv on Wednesday. Vereshchuk said: “We understand that there will not be enough seats for everyone, so please come to the buses in an organised manner, according to the instructions of our representatives in place. We will not leave anyone and we will continue to evacuate daily according to the same algorithm until we take everyone out.” Ukraine’s government defied an ultimatum by the Russian military for its forces in Mariupol to “lay down arms” by 5am Moscow time (2am GMT) on Monday. The city council in Mariupol has said that Russian forces had “destroyed almost 80% of the city’s infrastructure in 22 days, of which 30% can no longer be rebuilt”. The fate of those inside an art school flattened on Sunday and a theatre targeted four days earlier remains unclear. “Mariupol residents are in terrible conditions and are overcoming new challenges every day,” the city council said. Lyudmila Denisova, Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman, said Russian forces had fired on Monday’s evacuation buses from Mariupol and that four children had been taken to hospital. As of 8am BST on Tuesday, 117 children had died in the war and more than 155 children had been injured, she said. “It is impossible to establish the actual number of dead and wounded children due to the fact that the occupying forces are actively fighting in Ukrainian cities,” Denisova added. “In the Kharkiv region, a Russian tank shot down a car with a family of two children. The family shouted that they were civilians, waving a white flag, but in vain. Parents and a nine-year-old girl were killed and a 17-year-old boy was injured. “As a result of attack of the village of Konstantinovka of the Nikolaev area houses were destroyed, under their blockages the burnt bodies of three people, among which the seven-year-old child are found. On 21 March the occupiers fired on evacuation buses with children from Mariupol. Four children were taken to hospital.” The Russian government denies shelling civilians. Russia sees Mariupol as key to securing a corridor between the separatist Donbas region and illegally annexed Crimea. It is also home to the largest trading port in the Azov Sea from which Ukraine exports grain, iron and steel, and heavy machinery. A Ukrainian MP, Anton Gerashchenko, said that the siege of the city was being led by Col Gen Mikhail Mizintsev, a favourite of Vladimir Putin, and who was said to be responsible for Russian operations in Syria.",News/World news,"Russian shelling has reduced Mariupol to ‘ashes of a dead land’, Ukraine says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/ukraine-begs-putin-civilians-escape-ruins-mariupol-russia
3/23/2022,"For several months, the mysterious 140-metre-long, six-floor superyacht has towered over the smaller boats in the shipyard in Marina di Carrara, a town on Italy’s Tuscan coast, arousing chatter among its people over the identity of its wealthy owner. “It’s the largest yacht I’ve ever seen here,” said Suzy Dimitrova, who owns a boat in the marina. “There are people cleaning it all the time. The last time I saw it leave [the shipyard] was last year. We’re all wondering who the owner is.” The Scheherazade, said to be worth $700m (£528m), is under investigation by Italian authorities for potential links to sanctioned Russians. And activists working with the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny are in no doubt that the yacht is owned by the Russian president Vladimir Putin. On Monday, investigative journalist Maria Pevchikh and anti-corruption activist Georgy Alburov said that all crew members, obtained from a list dating December 2020, were Russian, apart from the captain. In a video published on YouTube, they claimed that some of the yacht’s staff worked for the Russia’s Federal Protective Service (FSO), an agency that manages security for high-ranking officials including Putin. The activists, who have urged Italian authorities to seize the yacht, said this information proves it belongs to Putin. “They are Russian state employees, military personnel, and they regularly travel to Italy as a group to work on the mysterious yacht,” Pevchikh wrote on Twitter. The interior of the vessel was described as being equipped with a spa, swimming pools, two helipads, a wood-burning fireplace and a pool table designed to tilt so as to reduce the impact of the waves. Marina di Carrara is close to Forte dei Marmi, a favourite holiday destination for Russian oligarchs, many of whom have bought villas and beach resorts. In early March, Italian police seized a yacht owned by Alexei Mordashov, the richest man in Russia before being blacklisted by the European Union, and another owned by Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire with close ties to Putin, in the Ligurian port of Imperia. The yacht can only be seen through a fence, where it is continuing to undergo a refit, scheduled to be completed next year, in a shipyard owned by The Italian Sea Group, a company that refits and builds luxury yachts. The mystery over its owner gathered momentum in early March, when finance police in Carrara boarded the yacht as EU sanctions against Russian oligarchs kicked in over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The police seized ownership documents from the yacht’s British captain, Guy Bennett-Pearce. At the time, US officials told the New York Times that they were also investigating whether the yacht belonged to Putin. The Italian Sea Group said in a statement that it was continuing to work on the ship’s €6m (£5m) refit and maintenance despite the EU’s sanctions and that, according to documents in its possession, the vessel “is not attributable to the property of the Russian president Vladimir Putin”, and neither is it owned by a Russian on the sanction list. A source at the finance police unit in Carrara said that they are now aware who the owner is and will soon make an announcement. An investigation by La Stampa newspaper earlier this month had linked the vessel to Eduard Yurievich Khudainatov, the former president of the Russian state oil firm Rosneft, via a shell company registered in the Marshall Islands. But Italian police are reportedly certain that Khudainatov is not the yacht’s real owner. “He seems to be a man connected with Putin’s inner circle but not so rich as to own a yacht like the Scheherazade,” said Jacopo Iacoboni, the journalist for La Stampa who carried out the investigation. Until the Italian police reveal their findings, the people of Marina di Carrara continue to ponder, even if its presence causes concern. “Putin is the presumed owner, and looking at it now causes me a lot of anxiety because of what he is doing in Ukraine,” said Maria Cristina. However, there are no signs of protests being planned. “There are always a lot of words, but little action here,” said Dimitrova.",News/World news,‘Mysterious’: the $700m superyacht in Italy some say belongs to Putin,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/people-clean-it-all-the-time-the-mystery-700m-super-yacht-in-italy-that-some-say-belongs-to-putin
3/23/2022,"The UK appears set to criminalise illicit refugee crossings and could ship asylum seekers for processing in other countries after ministers easily saw off a potential rebellion in the Commons over the controversial borders and nationality bill. Despite a number of Conservative backbenchers expressing concerns about aspects of the bill, the government convincingly won a string of votes to restore elements changed in the House of Lords, including the idea of Australian-style third country processing. Speaking in the debate, Tom Pursglove, the junior migration minister, confirmed that, as restored, the bill could see Ukrainian refugees who arrived without permission removed for processing. He added there was “absolutely no reason” for Ukrainian nationals to resort to illicit crossings. He said the powers to prosecute and jail people who arrive by unofficial means, such as on a small boat across the Channel, would only be used in “egregious cases”, such as someone entering the country in breach of a deportation order. Tory rebels did claim a slight victory after Pursglove agreed to meet them to discuss ideas to allow all asylum seekers to more easily access work, as is already the case for those from Ukraine and Afghanistan. This was welcomed by Robert Buckland, the former lord chancellor, who was among more than 60 Tory MPs and peers who signed a letter backing a change, saying he hoped to reach “a mutually agreeable solution” with the government over the issue. There was, however, barely any open revolt against the government. Only two Conservatives, Simon Hoare and Tim Loughton, voted to keep the Lords amendment on rules over work, while three voted against overseas processing – Loughton again, and former ministers Andrew Mitchell and David Davis. In all, seven Lords amendments were put to the vote, with other areas including family reunions and targeting illicit entry to the UK, and all were overturned by significant majorities, the lowest being 59. The bill will now be reconsidered by the Lords, possibly at the end of this month. The government has argued its approach is necessary to stop people making dangerous Channel boat trips with people smugglers. But responding for Labour, the shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the system would be “neither fair, compassionate nor orderly”. Mitchell and Davis both castigated the plan for overseas processing, with the former saying that if the costs were similar to those seen by Australia, rather than sending asylum seekers abroad “it would be much cheaper to put each one in the Ritz, and send all the under-18s to Eton”. Davis said the approach amounted to offering poorer countries “a spectacular bribe to take in our dirty washing”. Citing the numerous reports of assaults and self-harm in Australian camps, he said: “That’s what we appear to be trying to copy here.” The former de facto deputy prime minister, Damian Green, warned that the plan would do little to ease the boat landings as there were no legitimate routes available for the nationalities most involved, such as people from Iran, Iraq and Yemen. “Those routes need to be available, and for far too many people they are not available under the current system,” Green said. Tim Farron, the former Liberal Democrat leader, gave a passionate speech calling the bill “a traffickers’ charter”. He said: “You vote for this bill, you are voting for deaths in the Channel. You remove the right for anyone who is not Ukrainian, Afghan or Syrian to have a safe route here. That is an outrage, and members opposite know that is the truth.”",News/World news,UK set to criminalise illicit refugee crossings after ministers avoid Commons rebellion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/uk-set-to-criminalise-illicit-refugee-crossings-after-commons-rebellion-averted
3/23/2022,"The UK has a long and proud tradition of welcoming refugees, said the Home Office minister Tom Pursglove as he opened the debate on the consideration of House of Lords amendments to the nationality and borders bill. He went on to single out the Kindertransport, Afghanistan and Ukraine. It sounded wonderful, only none of it was quite true. The Kindertransport became part of our history because we weren’t quite so welcoming to Jewish men and women in the late 1930s. Then there was Afghanistan, where we had done bugger all for ages before the prime minister decided he was keener on rescuing mutts than saving Afghan interpreters. And for several weeks the UK lagged behind the rest of Europe in its response to Ukraine and it took the country’s citizens to shame the government into upping its game. Still, we get to write our own history and we tell ourselves the stories we want to hear. But even if his rose-tinted account had been accurate, Pursglove was in the chamber to say that enough was enough. No more Mr Nice Guy. No more Britain being a soft touch. The time had come to be cruel to be kind. Or better still, to be cruel to be cruel. So he was there to put the House on notice that the government was going to ignore all attempts by the Lords and the opposition to water down the bill. No ifs, no buts. He and Priti Patel were fed up with listening to woke liberals. Stupidity and viciousness are clearly contagious in the Home Office. None of it made much sense. One amendment was to be voted down just for the hell of it. Much to the confusion of Stuart C McDonald, the SNP’s home affairs spokesperson. He wanted to know why the government was so keen to get rid of legislation committing the UK to fulfil its obligations under the UN refugee convention when the minister was insistent the UK would always go out of its way to meet them. Where was the harm in maintaining an amendment that committed you to doing what you said you were going to do anyway? Which was why he couldn’t help being a bit suspicious that the government wasn’t being entirely honest about its intentions. Pursglove ploughed on, aided and abetted by Tory MPs Lee Anderson and Jonathan Gullis, whose mistrust of foreigners is second only to their hatred of soft-hearted members of the opposition. All three would be first in line to bang up a Ukrainian who had made the fatal error of fleeing the war without first having filled in the necessary visa forms. It would be wrong to give refugees the right to work after six months because that would only encourage more illegal migrants. And their only worry about using a wave machine to push refugees back to France was that they might enjoy it too much. It might make them feel as if they were at Alton Towers. Most importantly, it was vital that the government should be able to continue to pursue the option of processing refugees and asylum seekers offshore. And that included children, if they showed up with their families. Preferably somewhere many thousands of miles away. That would make sure only the most determined and desperate tried to get to the UK. Sadly, Pursglove had to admit that the bit of paper on which the Home Office had calculated how much all this was going to cost had gone astray. Which was probably just as well, observed shadow Home Office minister Stephen Kinnock, as the real cost would be about £1m per head. For that money you could fly refugees into the country first-class, buy them a house, give them £100k to make them feel at home and still have some change. But hey, you can’t put a price on making life unpleasant for people fleeing persecution. Kinnock also made the fatal error of suggesting the government had Ascension Island in mind as a potential processing centre. Pursglove was outraged. Ascension Island had turned down Priti Vacant’s request and the Home Office was busy looking for another country to take our asylum seekers. Tory MP Tim Loughton decided he had had enough. He was fed up with Labour being so negative about the government’s exciting new immigration plans. So what would he do? Kinnock looked at him as if he was an idiot. Read my lips. He would be voting to retain the Lords’ amendments. Not ideal, but the best he could do under the circumstances. Oh, and also he wouldn’t go around insulting other EU leaders as the Suspect had made a habit of doing. Oddly, it might prove easier to solve an international problem by working with other countries. Not all Conservative MPs were won over by Pursglove’s arguments. There again, his delivery is so monotone that it’s a wonder he doesn’t put himself to sleep. Or perhaps he does. It would explain a lot. Damian Green pointed out quite reasonably that if the government didn’t provide any safe routes for refugees – these were done for those fleeing Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen – then they would inevitably end up taking unsafe ones. And a civilised country was duty-bound to provide safe routes. Though this was Johnson’s and Patel’s UK he was talking about. David Davis focused on offshoring refugees, pointing out that it had been a humanitarian disaster in Australia, with thousands of children suffering from mental health problems. Pursglove looked confused. Surely that was the whole point? The most impassioned speech of the day was made by Liberal Democrat Tim Farron, who called the bill a “traffickers’ charter” and said that voting for it was voting for more deaths in the Channel. Refugees weren’t coming to the UK because it was so wonderful, but because their lives at home were so unbearable. It was the worst piece of legislation he had seen in 17 years, he said. No matter. The government comfortably won the votes to throw out the Lords’ amendments. The UK had chosen to make itself a nastier, more unfriendly country. Or just maintained a not-so-proud tradition.",News/Politics,Refugees the losers as Home Office helper shows he can be Priti unfriendly too,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/22/refugees-the-losers-as-home-office-helper-shows-he-can-be-priti-unfriendly-too
3/23/2022,"A judge terminated Amanda Bynes’ conservatorship on Tuesday, ending the legal arrangement that has given the former actor’s mother control of her estate and personal affairs for nearly a decade. The 35-year-old filed a petition last month, with support from her mother and psychiatrist, to end the conservatorship she was placed under in 2013 after she was forcibly hospitalized on a psychiatric hold. “I’m excited for her. She is excited,” Bynes’ attorney, David A Esquibias, told Variety on Monday. “We’re all excited and we’re all anxiously looking forward to Amanda living a life as a private and normal citizen.” On Friday, the Ventura county judge overseeing the case had already indicated he intended to end Bynes conservatorship. “Petitioner has provided facts that the conservatorship is no longer needed,” Judge Roger L Lund wrote in Friday’s tentative ruling. Bynes starred in Nickelodeon’s All That and the Amanda Show and films such as What a Girl Wants and She’s the Man, before announcing her retirement from acting in 2010. Bynes was placed on a psychiatric hold in 2013 after reportedly starting a small fire, and a judge granted her parents a temporary conservatorship that was extended several times in the years since. In the years before the conservatorship was put in place, tabloids had seized on her legal troubles, which included hit-and-run and DUI charges. Bynes has spoken out about mental health struggles, saying she was diagnosed “bipolar and manic depressive”. In a 2018 interview, she told Paper Magazine she struggled with body image issues and drug abuse that affected her behavior and mental health and “ruined” her life. Bynes is now sober and has earned an associate degree from the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising. She’s now pursuing a bachelor’s degree, and has gotten engaged. She has lived in a “structured community for women in need” since 2020, according to Variety, where her lawyer said she has “done very well in a very short period of time that she’s been there” and she is now able to live independently. In a statement to People on Tuesday, Bynes shared her appreciation for her fans. “Following today’s decision by the judge to terminate my conservatorship, I would like to thank my fans for their love and well wishes during this time. I would also like to thank my lawyer and my parents for their support over the last nine years,” she said. “In the last several years, I have been working hard to improve my health so that I can live and work independently, and I will continue to prioritize my well-being in this next chapter.” Bynes’ effort to end her conservatorship comes months after Britney Spears years-long battle to end her own. A judge liberated the star from the nearly 14-year conservatorship in November in a triumph for Spears and the #FreeBritney movement, a once-dismissed fan-led campaign that brought attention to Spears’ situation and cast a harsh spotlight on the controversial legal arrangement.

It follows the life of the German Nobel winner, whose works include Death in Venice and The Magic Mountain, against the backdrop of Europe’s turmoil in the first half of the 20th century. Like his 2004 novel about Henry James, The Master, this book uses fiction to imagine the mind of a writer from the past. Guardian reviewer Lucy Hughes-Hallett called it “an enormously ambitious book, one in which the intimate and the momentous are exquisitely balanced”. A statement from this year’s judges, Tessa Hadley, William Atkins and Rachel Long, called The Magician “a capacious, generous, ambitious novel, taking in a great sweep of 20th-century history, yet rooted in the intimate detail of one man’s private life”. Long added that, after reading 80 books during the judging process, Tóibín’s novel made her “fall in love with reading all over again”. Tóibín had written four chapters of The Magician when he was diagnosed with cancer in 2018. Six months of chemotherapy followed. “I knew that if the cancer came back, the chances of writing the book were zero,” he said. “Once I could start working again, I worked really hard and really fast.” Only when the novel was complete would he worry about his health, he decided. “Anyway, I finished it,” he said. The cancer has not returned. The Rathbones Folio prize was set up after the 2011 Man Booker prize judges attracted controversy for praising books with “readability” that “zip along”. The new prize would aim, said literary agent Andrew Kidd who came up with the idea, to bring literary gems to as wide a public as possible. Unlike the Booker, it considers nonfiction and poetry as well as fiction, and all the books considered for the prize are selected by an academy of peers, with judges chosen from that academy. Previous winners include George Saunders for short stories, Tenth of December, and Raymond Antrobus for his debut poetry collection The Perseverance. Last year’s winner was Carmen Maria Machado for her memoir In the Dream House. Tóibín has been shortlisted for the prize once before, and for the Booker three times. Winning the Rathbones Folio for The Magician feels “important and gratifying”, he said. “It was a difficult book to write. Researching it took 15 years, but the task was to make it read as the story of a family in a turbulent time rather than a piece of historical research.” Having risen to the top of a shortlist that included Booker winner The Promise by Damon Galgut, Tóibín said it was “a surprise” to win. He has no idea what he’ll do with the prize money yet, and is currently busy teaching at New York’s Columbia University. In May, he plans to continue work on a new book that is a “kind of sequel to [his much-loved 2009 novel] Brooklyn”.",Arts/Books,Irish novelist Colm Tóibín wins Rathbones Folio prize for The Magician,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/22/irish-novelist-colm-toibin-wins-rathbones-folio-prize-for-the-magician
3/23/2022,"Kim Little said Arsenal’s Champions League performances were “not good enough” in the first half of the season but that the team are a different beast going into Wednesday’s quarter-final first leg against Wolfsburg under the lights at the Emirates Stadium. Arsenal scraped into the last eight on head-to-head goal difference with Hoffenheim after twice losing heavily to the reigning champions, Barcelona – 4-1 in Spain and 4-0 at the Emirates Stadium. The team also suffered a surprising 4-1 defeat at Hoffenheim in their final group game. “Our performances have been much better in the last two months and the results have followed that,” Little said. “Towards the end of last year our performances in the Champions League weren’t good enough and we need to be mindful of that.” Arsenal nosedived after defeat by Chelsea in the FA Cup final and the second loss to Barcelona ruptured momentum. Jonas Eidevall’s side lost three of their next four games before a 90th-minute equaliser from Tobin Heath against Manchester City in the league restored some confidence. “I think we were disappointed with both our results against Barcelona and mostly our performance,” said Little. “Our results told one picture, but I think we all know as individuals we didn’t perform how we wanted. Tomorrow we’ll be braver and more proactive and learn from that experience so that when it comes to these slightly different games we’ll make sure we turn up and perform to our best, which is what will be required.” Since the 1-1 draw with City, Arsenal have won seven games and drawn two, against Manchester United and their title rivals Chelsea. That run, boosted by the return of injured players and January signings, has ensured that the team remain in the hunt in three competitions. But Eidevall cautioned that just taking part is not enough. “[We need to] be present, to take our chances,” the manager said. “It’s great that we’re in the position we are in, in three competitions, but we have to understand that at a club like Arsenal that’s not enough. We want to win trophies, that’s what we need to push for and that’s when we can be happy with results. That’s what separates the big clubs from the smaller clubs.” Wolfsburg are not Barcelona but they are a strong team and have huge Champions League pedigree, having reached five of the past nine finals, winning twice. “Wolfsburg is a top team, of course, but we play against top teams in the league: Chelsea and Manchester City are also top European teams, with their squads,” said Eidevall. “Barcelona has been an anomaly. Wolfsburg has a lot of fluidity. They are very very good on the counterattack and we haven’t played a team so far this season that has been that good on the counter. At the same time, I don’t think they have been exposed to our style of football either. “I believe in being proactive. If we set our gameplan right, then they should be changing to deal with our style.” The removal of the away goals rule this season helps attacking and proactive football, he believes. “Now it’s easier, it’s less challenging for the brain: be as good as you can over 180 minutes,” said Eidevall. “One of the better things with getting rid of away goals is you can keep attacking at home. If you’re winning 2-0 you can go for the third but before, you knew that you could be opening yourself up if you were too offensive. So hopefully we see more attacking football.” ",Sport/Football,Kim Little promises improved Arsenal for Champions League quarter-finals,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/22/kim-little-promises-improved-arsenal-for-champions-league-quarter-finals
3/23/2022,"Downing Street has condemned critics of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe who accused her of being “ungrateful” after she expressed frustration with the UK government for taking six years to secure her release from an Iranian jail. Days after touching down in Britain, Zaghari-Ratcliffe faced abuse on social media for saying it should not have taken so long for ministers to ensure she returned home safely. In a press conference in parliament on Monday, she said her husband, Richard, had suggested she thank the foreign secretary, Liz Truss. “I do not really agree with him on that level because I have seen five foreign secretaries changed over the course of six years,” Zaghari-Ratcliffe said. “How many foreign secretaries does it take for someone to come home? Five? It should have been one of them eventually.” A torrent of social media abuse was levelled at her in the aftermath. The prominent Brexit campaigner Arron Banks called the comments “charming” and said she was “stupidly in an hostile country that we sanction heavily”. He later posted a picture of Zaghari-Ratcliffe with a group of people including her local MP, Labour’s Tulip Siddiq, and the party leader, Keir Starmer, adding it was “hard to imagine she wasn’t politically active in Iran”. Another poster said: “See #ungrateful trending, after [£]400m spent to release her she takes aim at the government in a very polished vile manner. BTW – wish i looked that good when i am ‘broken’. #sendherback.” Others used the same hashtags and called her a “disgrace”, hitting out at what they called a “rude & ungrateful showing at her press conference”. Susan Hall, the leader of the Greater London authority Conservatives, also tweeted: “Errr what you really mean is that Iranians should not have unlawfully kept you as prisoner for 6 years. Now it appears that it’s Britains fault … in your eyes. I hope I am wrong but that’s what it feels like you are implying.” And David Bannerman, a former Conservative MEP, said: “I do hope she’s not biting the hand that saved her. Does she bear no responsibility for being in a country with such a nasty regime?” However, No 10 said Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been through an “unimaginable ordeal” during her time in Iran and defended her right to criticise the UK government. Boris Johnson’s spokesperson said: “Clearly, someone who has been through the sort of ordeal that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has, should not have to face any sort of abuse, social media or otherwise. “She has been through an unimaginable ordeal, and we are extremely pleased that she is now reunited with her family. And as a UK citizen, someone in a free and democratic country, she is rightly able to voice her opinion on any topic she wishes.” Jeremy Hunt, one of the foreign secretaries who tried to secure Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release, also said on Tuesday that people criticising her had “got it so wrong”. “She doesn’t owe us gratitude: we owe her an explanation,” he tweeted. “She’s absolutely right that it took too long to bring her home. I tried my best – as did other foreign secretaries – but if trying our best took six years then we must be honest and say the problem should have been solved earlier. “This kind of open scrutiny as to whether we could do things better is what happens in democratic, open societies.” David Lammy, Labour’s shadow foreign secretary, also said: “Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe does not owe the government gratitude. The government owes Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe an explanation for what took it so long.”",News/News,No 10 condemns abuse levelled at ‘ungrateful’ Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/22/no-10-condemns-abuse-levelled-at-ungrateful-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe
3/23/2022,"Ofgem, the energy regulator, has a lot on its plate. Some 29 retail suppliers have gone bust in the past six months, Gazprom Energy, the Kremlin-backed company that supplies 20% of the UK’s non-domestic market, may soon need a quasi-nationalisation as corporate customers defect. Meanwhile, the country needs a new energy strategy, for which the technocrats’ input will be required. There ought still to be space, though, for Ofgem to address the issue that Martin Lewis, the money saving guy, raised with MPs on Tuesday: companies playing “fast and loose” by whacking up consumers’ direct debits beyond what’s justified by next month’s hike in the energy price cap to £1,971 for an average household. Which suppliers are guilty, Lewis was asked. Virtually all of them, he replied. One suspects he’s right because there is clearly a temptation for loss-making companies to improve their short-term cashflow positions in the current environment. Consumers are confused about the mechanics of how a 54% increase in the cap is supposed to translate into an adjustment in their direct debit payment. Meanwhile, price competition between companies has disappeared. In cases where an account is in arrears, a doubling of a monthly direct debit will be legitimate. But it was alarming that Lewis relayed tales of companies defending cap-beating increases for in-credit customers on the grounds that a further rise lies around the next corner. That tactic is a try-on. Yes, the Ofgem tariff probably will increase again in October (to £2,500, say latest projections) but that is not a reason to crank up balances in advance unless customers agree. Ofgem will do everybody a favour when it gets round to implementing stiffer rules on ring-fencing of consumer deposits, thereby reducing the incentive for companies to borrow, in effect, from bill-payers. In the meantime, a general regulatory warning to suppliers would be in order. If Lewis is correct, sneaky behaviour, to describe it generously, is going under the radar. Finally, a volunteer for the role of chair of THG, a job that will require more than telling founder, chief executive and landlord Matt Moulding to refrain from blaming his stock market troubles on wicked short-sellers. Charles Allen has had a wide-ranging career since his days as top man at ITV, but has probably never encountered a company quite like THG, or The Hut Group as it was. His arrival gives the appearance of governance normality, but it’s the substance of any reforms that will count. The easy part should be “refreshing” – in the statement’s polite language – a board where the crew of non-executives is too dominated by representatives of THG’s former private equity backers. As for improving transparency, yes, that’s obviously needed. Moulding has warbled unconvincingly about the supposed hidden value within THG’s Ingenuity division – the bit that provides “end-to-end technology services” to other people’s brands – but has never offered a divisional profit breakdown to justify the boasts. Err on the side of maximum disclosure. Until then, sceptical analysts are entitled to see Ingenuity only as a bits-and-pieces logistics set-up. The critical element will be Allen’s review of strategic options. Japanese group SoftBank surely isn’t going to exercise its option to pay $1.6bn (£1.2bn) for 20% of Ingenuity since THG’s entire market capitalisation is just £1bn these days. Instead, the pressing question is whether to go ahead with a demerger of the Lookfantastic-based beauty division, previously advertised as stage one of an eventual three-way split with the nutrition operation to follow. Is there any point to the corporate gymnastics if online retailers everywhere have lost their sky-high ratings? Allen would do well to talk Moulding out of his obsession with rejigging the structure. Just spend the next two years flogging more make-up and protein shakes and demonstrating there’s a real business at the heart of this baffling company. Visionary stuff can wait. It’s a minor moment in shopkeeping history: Kingfisher, the B&Q and Screwfix group, is the third British retailer to make an annual pre-tax profit of more than £1bn. The other two are Marks & Spencer and Tesco. Kingfisher enjoyed a push from lockdown and working-from-home factors and is not expecting a repeat this year: it is “comfortable” with analysts’ forecasts of £769m. But there is no reason to fear a M&S-style post-peak descent into crisis. DIY is a defensive sector and there are fews signs yet that the squeeze on household budgets is affecting demand for big-ticket items like kitchens and bathrooms. Meanwhile, the French Castorama and Brico Dépôt chains have been rewired and Screwfix still has scope for expansion. The long-term outlook looks more in line with comfortable Tesco-style dependability.",News/Business,"Ofgem may be busy, but it must address Martin Lewis’s points | Nils Pratley",https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/22/ofgem-may-be-busy-but-it-must-address-martin-lewiss-points
3/23/2022,"The UK is running out of anti-tank weapons to send to Ukraine, the defence secretary appeared to tell Russian impostors posing as the Ukrainian prime minister, according to the latest video released by the pair. Downing Street has said it believes Russian state actors were responsible for the hoax, in which an impersonator was put through for a video call with Ben Wallace about the situation in Ukraine. Officials said they were prepared for more details from the call to be released in the coming days and that they anticipated this would be timed to cause maximum embarrassment to the British government, including at the Nato summit this week. Wallace took the call from Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexey Stolyarov, who are known as Vovan and Lexus, believing it was Denys Shmyhal, the Ukrainian prime minister, but became suspicious midway through the call. The pair are suspected of links to Russia’s security services, although they have denied this. The hoax callers also managed to get through to the home secretary, Priti Patel, and attempted to reach the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, who alerted the Foreign Office before the call request was accepted. Cabinet ministers and senior officials have been warned to be on their guard for further attempts to embarrass them in the coming days and weeks. Western officials believe Russia intends to step up tactics to divide the response of western allies to the invasion of Ukraine, including by embarrassment such as that caused by the hoax call to Wallace. They do not think the hoax was intended to be an intelligence-collecting technique, more a strategy of disruption. In a clip posted to YouTube, Wallace looks bewildered as the hoaxer says the NLAWs (next generation light anti-tank weapons) that the UK has supplied to Ukraine have failed. Wallace said he was in touch daily with Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov. “I don’t think ours have failed. I’ve got the details of ours. We’ve given you over 4,000. We’ve got more coming,” he said. “We’re running out of our own. I speak to Reznikov and text him every day.” In an earlier clip released on Monday, Wallace appears to be asked if he would support Ukraine’s nuclear aims; Russia has falsely claimed Kyiv has nuclear ambitions. A defence source said: “It’s a doctored clip. What you don’t hear is the defence secretary also saying that the UK can’t have anything to do with alleged Ukrainian nuclear ambitions, because the UK is committed to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.” However, the source did not dispute the substance of what Wallace appeared to have said.UK officials view this week as a crucial moment for western unity in the face of escalating attacks by Russia on civilian populations. Boris Johnson will attend the Nato summit in Brussels this week, along with the US president, Joe Biden, where he is expected to make the case for western allies to ramp up supplies of defensive weapons to Ukraine. The prime minister will tell allies at the Nato summit that there is an immediate imperative to support the Ukrainians now, according to UK sources, and that the Russian tactics of indiscriminately firing on civilian centres is inherently escalatory.",News/Politics,"UK running low on anti-tank weapons, defence secretary tells Russian hoaxers",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/22/uk-anti-tank-weapons-defence-secretary-russian-hoax-call
3/23/2022,"Jason Roy has been hit with a suspended two-match ban from international cricket and a £2,500 fine, the reasons for which are being kept out of the public domain by the England and Wales Cricket Board. Announcing the sanction on Tuesday, the ECB statement said the limited‑overs opener had accepted a charge of bringing the game into disrepute handed down by its Cricket Discipline Commission, with the suspended element of his ban “dependent on good behaviour” over the next 12 months. The governing body has since said the CDC, which deals with disciplinary issues in the professional game and operates at “arm’s length”, is not prepared to provide any further details about Roy’s alleged transgression, raising questions over the transparency of the process. The statement read: “A disciplinary panel of the Cricket Discipline Commission has announced its sanction on Jason Roy after he admitted a charge of conducting himself in a manner which may be prejudicial to the interests of cricket or which may bring the game of cricket, the ECB and himself into disrepute, in breach of ECB Directive 3.3.” While Roy must pay his fine by the end of the month, he will be available for England’s next set of white-ball fixtures – a three-match away series against Netherlands in June – having most recently featured during the five-match Twenty20 series against West Indies in the Caribbean in January. The 2019 World Cup winner has since announced a break from cricket to “spend some quality time with my family” after pulling out of a £200,000 deal to play for Gujarat Titans in the Indian Premier League.

3/23/2022,"Ferry operator P&O has revealed it is paying £36.5m to cover compensation for the 800 seafarers it sacked without warning. It is understood staff who accept the payouts will be required to sign non-disclosure agreements requiring them not to disparage the company. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, told the House of Commons on Monday P&O was using the agreements to “keep the employees quiet”, and accused the company of acting in a “shameful and unacceptable way”. The company said it believed the settlement would be the “largest compensation package in the British marine sector”. The payouts being offered to dismissed staff are linked to their length of service with the company, and in some cases workers will be paid more than £170,000. P&O Ferries said 575 out of the 786 seafarers dismissed by the company are in discussions over the severance offers, with some receiving compensation equivalent to 91 weeks’ pay. It said more than 40 workers will receive more than £100,000, while no worker will receive less than £15,000. P&O is offering two-and-a-half weeks’ salary for each year of employment, as well as up to 13 weeks’ salary in lieu of notice, and a further 13 weeks’ salary because of the absence of a consultation period. It said the compensation package was the basis for offers made to workers at the time of dismissal. The announcement came as the government warned P&O Ferries could face prosecution over the sackings, while Shapps said ministers were reviewing all government contracts and dealing with the ferry operator and parent company DP World. A spokesperson for P&O Ferries said: “This has been an incredibly tough decision for the business: to make this choice or face taking the company into administration. This would have meant the loss of 3,000 jobs and the end of P&O Ferries.” The company said it had taken the “hard choice” to dismiss workers to guarantee the “future viability of P&O Ferries” and avoid large-scale and lengthy disruption to trade. Several P&O services including sailings on the Dover to Calais route remain suspended, while further protests are planned at ports around the UK for the coming days. The RMT union said on Tuesday that seafarers from abroad had been brought in to replace the 800 sacked British crew and were being paid as little as £1.80 an hour. P&O Ferries disputed the figures but declined to discuss the rates or give alternative rates and would not confirm whether it paid the minimum wage. The company said it would give support to sacked workers to find a new job either at sea or onshore, and would help those who could not find a new job.

3/23/2022,"Vladimir Putin’s regime hunts down the truth and celebrates lies. It threatens to jail those who describe honestly what is happening in Ukraine – a war. It brazenly denies documented attacks upon civilians. It concocts claims that the US and Ukraine plot to spread pathogens using migratory birds. It accuses others of its own sins: known for its willingness to fake events, it claimed that a heavily pregnant, visibly injured woman photographed leaving the bombed maternity ward in Mariupol was an actor. Those images, and her story, were captured by a photographer and a reporter from the Associated Press. The absence of information in a blockade has two goals, noted the reporter, Mstyslav Chernov: chaos, as people panic, but also impunity. “With no information coming out of a city, no pictures of demolished buildings and dying children, the Russian forces could do whatever they wanted.” Chernov has revealed that Ukrainian soldiers had risked their lives to extract him and his colleague from the city because Russians were hunting for them – hoping to force them to retract their work on camera and say that everything they had filmed was a lie. Russia has long sought to create its own reality, both by denying the truth and by inventing a new story. But at home its repression has dramatically expanded since the invasion. Facebook and Instagram have been banned, and Twitter blocked; access to foreign news media restricted. The introduction of a law that punishes spreading “fake news” with up to 15 years in prison prompted journalists to flee the country; independent outlets including the Meduza website and radio station Ekho Moskvy were blocked or shut down. Meanwhile, state media pumps out lies. That many of Russia’s denials and accusations are demonstrably untrue, deeply unconvincing or plainly ludicrous may not matter. The goal is to confuse, not convince. Russian disinformation penetrated our society long ago: working to promote Donald Trump’s campaigns in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections; meddling in the Brexit referendum. In some cases the aim has not been to further a particular cause, but to foster division, such as by amplifying strongly pro- and anti-vaccine messages. And beyond direct involvement, Russian meddling has contributed to a political style – most obviously, that of Mr Trump – which treats truth and fact as dispensable and irrelevant. The challenges are growing as technology develops. Last week, a deepfake surfaced: a short clip purporting to show Volodymyr Zelenskiy telling Ukrainian soldiers to lay down their arms. Though crudely executed, it points towards the new perils ahead. But sunlight remains a powerful disinfectant. The US, Ukraine and the UK have begun “prebunking”: warning when they anticipate that Russia will launch “false flag” operations, and revealing that a hoax video call had been made to the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, before the hoaxers released it. Disinformation campaigns must be fully investigated and exposed – something the UK signally failed to do in the case of the Brexit referendum, as the intelligence and security committee’s report on Russian influence noted. This may also mean ensuring that tech firms archive, not simply delete, disinformation, to ensure it can be traced back. But supporting those who get it right is as important as holding bad actors accountable. Above all, we must celebrate the courage of those who speak the truth, be they Ukrainians on the frontline like the AP team, or Russians like Marina Ovsyannikova, who disrupted Channel One’s main news broadcast, and the staff of newspaper Novaya Gazeta. As Chernov, the AP reporter, observed: “I have never, ever felt that breaking the silence was so important.”",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on disinformation: truth is a casualty of Russia’s war | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/22/the-guardian-view-on-disinformation-truth-is-a-casualty-of-russias-war
3/23/2022,"Boris Johnson cannot complain about the lack of an invitation to the European summit that begins on Thursday when his foreign policy is founded on a belief that such gatherings are not worth attending. It is true that Brexit doesn’t prevent the prime minister taking an active role in supporting Ukraine against Kremlin aggression. British military hardware is appreciated on the frontline. Mr Johnson can be in the loop of western diplomacy without a seat at the EU table. He will also be attending a Nato summit in Brussels on Thursday. In the Brexiter view, UK interests in Europe can be managed through the North Atlantic alliance and bilateral conversations with continental leaders. If that were true, and the EU were a strategic sideshow, Joe Biden would not be attending both summits in Brussels. But the US president recognises something that Mr Johnson denies – the European Council is a place where decisions of consequence are made. The prime minister would serve his country’s interests better from inside the room. The outbreak of war had raised hopes that the bombast and pettiness that has too often coloured British debate about the relationship with continental neighbours might be set aside. That hope was dashed when Mr Johnson made a speech last week drawing a grotesque comparison between Ukrainian resistance to the Russian invasion and the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Both reflected a common appetite for liberty, the prime minister said, mining a depth of crass cynicism to which even staunch critics did not think him capable of sinking. The trivialising thrust of the analogy was made all the more insulting in the context of Ukrainian ambitions to join the very European project that Mr Johnson casts as an imperial aggressor. For Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the EU and Nato are twin pillars of a democratic European order that stands in opposition to the worldview advanced by Vladimir Putin, where the rule of law is meaningless, might is right and borders are erased at a dictator’s whim. The concept of Europe as a democratic bastion was understood by countries of the former Warsaw Pact that sought Nato and EU membership as a package in the early 2000s. It is also understood by Mr Putin, who sees undermining EU solidarity as instrumental to the goal of sabotaging western interests. That is why he backed Brexit. That EU solidarity, resolute at the start of the war, is under strain. There are differences over the shape and pace of new sanctions against Moscow and how to meet the cost. The Baltic states and Poland, having more experience of Kremlin hostility, are hawkish in wanting to maximise pressure on Moscow. Germany resists embargos that might weaken European economies by limiting energy supplies and stoking prices. This week’s summit is likely to produce only conditional statements of tougher intent, not tougher action, disappointing those who would push harder against the Putin regime. That is a debate in which Britain would like a say. As one of the continent’s economic and military powers, it also has sway. Mr Johnson can be influential from outside a Brussels summit, but he has forfeited a say over the agenda. He has no one but himself to blame if decisions are made that he would have opposed had he been at the table.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Boris Johnson in Brussels: drop the Brexit rhetoric | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/22/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnson-in-brussels-drop-the-brexit-rhetoric
3/23/2022,"Jack Leach’s winter began with a “horrible” experience at the Gabba but he now feels central to England’s Test plans and wants to further develop a more attacking mindset after watching videos of Graeme Swann in his pomp. The left-arm spinner heads into the deciding third Test against West Indies, starting on Thursday, fresh from a gruelling workload of 94.5 overs during the drawn second Test at Kensington Oval that returned six of his 11 wickets on tour but in which both he and England were thwarted by Kraigg Brathwaite’s stickability. Leach’s duel with Brathwaite, in which the West Indies captain spent a combined 15 hours making scores of 160 and 56 not out, featured one belated success, in the first innings, when he spun one past the bat and bowled his man. It was something of a staring contest overall, however, with more than 200 dot balls chalked up and Leach sending down 40 maidens in the match. It is certainly a far cry from being taken for 102 runs in 13 overs in Brisbane last November and, though the slow surfaces have not offered more scope to run through a side, Leach feels he is learning plenty in the Caribbean. “I felt horrible [after the Gabba],” he said. “But I trained the next day – [the spin coach] Jeetan Patel made me – and I think I surprised myself with how I deal with lows. Australia was a tough trip but I came back motivated and buzzing. “ I’m trying to become the frontline spinner for England and I see the last couple of weeks as really valuable for my development on that road. It won’t be too long before I turn those three‑fors into five-fors, especially in the second innings.” Leach is not sure what more he could have done to prise Brathwaite from his rock sooner in Bridgetown after seeing a couple of gloved deliveries drop short of the catchers. His greatest takeaway, looking ahead to the third Test, is the need to hold his length for longer periods and adapt the approach depending on the age of the ball and how the pitch changes. “A big focus for me is having that attacking mindset, always looking to take wickets,” he said. “I’ve been guilty of easing into spells in the past, earning the right to bowl and go at two runs an over. But that’s a negative mindset. “I’ve watched YouTube videos of [the former England spinner] Graeme Swann and how attacking he looks. He’s thinking: ‘How am I trying to get this guy out?’, and that’s important early on, the first 20 balls versus a batter is your chance. “But even if it doesn’t happen and I’m bowling 60 overs, it’s important to keep that mindset. There are times when the pitches here have felt very unresponsive, especially when the ball is older; the newer ball grips and [on some days] the pitches have felt tacky early on and spin. “On the third morning I thought I could drive it into the wicket to get it to spin but as the ball gets older, you have to give it more air. That’s something I’ll take forward, it’s not something you get used to in England. But that’s part of the journey of learning to be a spinner in Test cricket.” Leach has not played a home Test since September 2019 and, as he acknowledges, match-winning performances will ultimately decide how much a career of 21 caps and 79 wickets to date truly flourishes. Key to this, he believes, is buying into the “team-first” mantra being espoused on this trip. “That’s been the message to everyone really,” the 30-year-old said. “It’s all about the team and we all have a voice. Before I felt a lot of pressure on my own game and you forget you are contributing to something bigger. “It almost takes the pressure off your own game. I said openly to the group here that at Somerset I feel I belong, so I feel more comfortable giving my points of view. Maybe because I felt I belonged in terms of what I offer on the cricket field. “We wouldn’t be here if we are not good enough cricketers, but we can offer in different ways. I want to offer with wickets, but if I’m not I want to be awesome in the field and try to score runs. I think maybe I got it a bit wrong beforehand. Not on purpose but I felt I was playing for my spot.” All eyes are now on the surface in Grenada and whether England will look to a second spinner in Matt Parkinson. The early suggestions are that the seamers will get more assistance than before, however, and so Leach, with 168 overs under his belt already this series, may be flying solo once more.",Sport/Sport,Jack Leach inspired by Graeme Swann in targeting frontline England role,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/22/jack-leach-inspired-by-graeme-swann-in-targeting-frontline-england-role
3/23/2022,"Tommy Robinson is potentially facing jail over possible contempt of court after failing to show up for a high court hearing where he was to be questioned about his finances after losing a libel case. The former English Defence League leader had claimed he was bankrupt after losing a libel case brought against him by Jamal Hijazi, who had been filmed being attacked at school in 2018. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was sued after falsely claiming in Facebook videos viewed by nearly 1 million people that Hijazi was “not innocent and he violently attacks young English girls in his school”. Damages of £100,000 were awarded to Hijazi, who is now aged 18. His legal costs were thought to be more than £500,000. Robinson was subsequently ordered to attend a hearing at the high court to be questioned by a lawyer for Hijazi – but failed to attend the hearing at 2pm on Tuesday. Judge Dagnall said that there may well be a reason for why Robinson, 39, was not present, but added “that is for another day” and said he could only refer the matter to a high court judge to consider if there had been contempt. “He knew perfectly well that this hearing was going to take place,” said Dagnall, adding that there had been a response from an email address that had been used to service notice to Robinson. He recalled that at a previous hearing it had been understood that documents and orders would be served on Robinson by email after he had complained that those living at his home address could be subject to threats “in light of his political activities” if it were used to serve further documents and orders. The judge added that he had to “dispense with a method of service” at Robinson’s own request, telling the hearing: “Therefore, anything that occurs with his email inbox is very much down to him.” Robinson clearly knew about the hearing, Dagnall added, not least because of various attempts by lawyers for Hijazi to contact him, and in any case he had replied to say he had received other documents. Ian Helme, for Hijazi, had previously told the court there was information “that what is stated in his bankruptcy application is not a full account of [Robinson’s] assets”. On Tuesday, the barrister said lawyers had “tried various methods to bring this to Mr Lennon’s attention” including sending documents by post to multiple addresses – including one in Tenerife and his ex-wife’s home – and to different phone numbers via WhatsApp. Helme also told the court that Robinson’s bankruptcy had now been discharged and so he would be personally liable for costs. Dagnall – a Queen’s bench master – said “all I can do” is refer Robinson’s non-attendance to a high court judge. “They may, if he or she chooses to do so, hold Mr Yaxley-Lennon in contempt,” he continued. “That is a matter for the high court judge.” However, Dagnall added that any committal for contempt of court could be suspended. Robinson has a number of previous convictions for contempt of court and disobeying court orders. Nick Lowles, CEO of Hope Not Hate, said the case was not just about money, but about justice. He added: “Tommy Robinson doesn’t care about the impact he had on the life of Jamal Hijazi and his family. He wants to continue to spread his vitriol and hate – and we are committed to stopping him.” In January, the anti-facist campaign group said it believed Robinson had access to assets worth up to about £3m through property acquisitions, investments, donations and book sales.",News/UK news,Tommy Robinson potentially facing jail after failing to attend high court,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/22/tommy-robinson-potentially-facing-jail-after-failing-to-attend-high-court
3/23/2022,"Rishi Sunak is expected to use his spring statement on Wednesday to announce measures to support UK households with growing challenges from the cost of living emergency and the war in Ukraine. Here are the key points to look out for from the chancellor’s update. Sunak will present new forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), with expectations for a weaker economic outlook as high inflation erodes consumers’ spending power. The consultancy Capital Economics expects a downgrade for GDP growth in 2022 from the 6% forecast in October to about 3.5%. Most attention will focus on the cost of living squeeze and workers’ pay. The Bank of England forecasts inflation will reach 8% this April, with a possible peak close to 10% later in the year. Recent stronger tax receipts mean the OBR is expected to forecast a substantial improvement for the public finances this year, possibly worth about £30bn compared with estimates made in October for borrowing of £183bn in 2021-22. Though the improvements could hand Sunak room to support families with living costs, he has also committed to reducing the deficit and national debt as a percentage of GDP. The chancellor is also likely to warn that high inflation adds to debt servicing costs. Sunak and Boris Johnson have previously insisted a planned 1.25 percentage point increase in national insurance contributions for workers and their employers will not be jettisoned. However, some reforms to national insurance could be likely under heavy pressure from Conservative backbenchers. Sunak could choose to defer the increase planned for this April. Another option would be to raise the threshold at which workers start paying national insurance to help those on the lowest incomes. Anticipation is building that Sunak will cut fuel duty, possibly by as much as 5p, in response to surging pump prices since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Fuel duty is 57.95p a litre, plus 20% VAT. The Conservatives have frozen fuel duty for 12 years but campaigners say this clashes with net zero ambitions. However, petrol and diesel have risen by more than 40p and 50p compared with a year ago. The Resolution Foundation estimates a 10p fuel duty cut would cost about £5bn while only reversing around a quarter of the past year’s rise. The chancellor has faced calls to raise the value of universal credit by more than planned to support poorer households. The value of benefits is planned to rise by 3.1% in April, based on September’s inflation rate. However, the Bank of England forecasts inflation could hit 8% this April. Sunak cut universal credit by £20 a week in October, although he made some changes to expand the benefit. Should he take action, the chancellor could argue a bigger increase this year should warrant a smaller rise or even a freeze in 2023. Bosses have pushed Sunak to incentivise business investment and to help firms with high energy costs. The CBI has lobbied the chancellor to turn his “super deduction” – which offers tax savings on business investment – into a permanent deduction to encourage firms to spend. The business group says this is necessary to offset a rise in corporation tax from 19% to 25% planned from April 2023. The Treasury is expected to launch several consultations on Wednesday ahead of taking action at the autumn budget. Sunak could expand the £9bn package of energy support announced last month. A temporary VAT cut on energy bills – potentially funded by a windfall tax on oil and gas companies – could be used, as pushed for by Labour – although it is thought to be unlikely. Government sources have attempted to downplay the significance of the spring statement, saying measures worth £21bn this year and next have already been announced to help with living costs. The government is also raising the minimum wage from £8.91 to £9.50 an hour from April. While energy prices will rise sharply in April, household gas and electricity bills will then be frozen until October. Sunak could argue his existing schemes are enough for now, with time to assess if more help is warranted later in the year. However, holding back could be politically costly as the squeeze on households intensifies.",News/Business,What new measures could Rishi Sunak introduce in spring statement?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/22/what-new-measures-could-rishi-sunak-introduce-in-spring-statement
3/23/2022,"Environmentalists have launched protests against a Russian tanker bringing oil into New York, amid a flurry of oil imports into the US before a ban on oil and gas coming from Russia comes into force. Activists from Greenpeace set out in two boats to intercept the Minerva Virgo oil tanker on Tuesday morning as it set about unloading its cargo in the port of New York. The green campaign group, which unfurled a banner reading “Oil fuels war” in front of the 50,000-ton tanker, had already confronted the Greek-flagged vessel on Sunday as it made its way to the port. “The oil and gas companies that are responsible for our skyrocketing gas prices are the same companies that are fueling conflicts and death around the globe,” said Anusha Narayanan, climate campaign director at Greenpeace USA, who was on one of the boats. “A more peaceful, livable, and equal future depends on breaking our addiction to volatile and conflict-driven fossil fuels.” The protest aimed to highlight how the US is continuing to import oil from Russia after Joe Biden’s decision on 8 March to ban the intake of oil and gas from Russia in what the US president called a “powerful blow to Putin’s war machine”. The White House allowed a 45-day grace period for oil imports after the announcement, meaning that ships bringing fossil fuels from Russia won’t be able to dock at American ports from 22 April. Some oil companies have decided to “self sanction” by not taking product from Russia, although there have been exceptions, such as Shell buying a heavily discounted consignment of Russian oil, before apologizing for doing so. This grace period is seeing plenty of activity, with a Greenpeace tracker showing that dozens of Russian oil shipments have headed towards the US and Europe. At least a dozen tankers that have left Russian ports have either unloaded in the US or are about to arrive. This includes the Kronviken, a crude oil tanker anchored near Houston, the Riverside, another crude oil tanker heading for Florida, and the Balla, a tanker bound for Los Angeles. Narayanan repeated climate campaigners’ demand for Biden to invoke the Defense Production Act, normally used in times of war to compel companies to churn out weapons, to force businesses to produce more solar panels, wind turbines and other clean energy technology. “True energy independence can only come from renewable energy,” she said. The administration has, however, been more focused on rebutting claims by the oil industry and Republicans that Biden has declared “war” on domestic fossil fuel production. The Biden administration has given out oil and gas drilling leases at a faster rate than Donald Trump did, although many of these leases on public land remain unused by the industry.",News/Environment,Activists protest tanker as Russian oil imports flow into US ahead of ban,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/22/activists-protest-tanker-russian-us-ban
3/23/2022,"The government has drawn up plans to take over the funding of the UK operation of the Russian energy giant Gazprom, should the state-backed supplier collapse as customers cut supply contracts due to the invasion of Ukraine. Officials have drawn up contingency plans to implement a financial lifeline for the business energy supplier, which has contracts in place with about two-thirds of the UK’s heaviest gas users, in the event that Gazprom Energy enters administration in the next few weeks. Gazprom Energy, which is facing a customer exodus following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, has tested the market’s appetite for a buyer as the company considers financial options. If Gazprom were to fail, it would be put into taxpayer-funded special administration – as occurred with Bulb, Britain’s seventh-biggest residential energy supplier, in November – because it is too large to be handled by energy regulator Ofgem’s “supplier of last resort” process. Bulb remains in administration with a taxpayer loan of £1.7bn. “We are aware that Gazprom Energy has a large presence in the non-domestic energy retail market,” said a government spokesperson. “Gazprom’s retail business continues to trade in the UK and customers should exercise their own commercial judgment with regards to energy supply contracts they have in place at the moment.” The firm supplies 100,000 sites across the UK, Ireland, France and the Netherlands, with offices in London and Manchester and about 350 staff. It accounts for about a fifth of the energy consumed by UK businesses, including councils and the NHS, but its clients are concentrated in industries such as ceramics, glass and steel. Earlier this month, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said that the NHS in England must stop using gas supplied by Gazprom. Merton council in London, and Suffolk county council have also said that they were attempting to break gas supply contracts with the company. Nishma Patel, the policy director at the Chemical Industries Association, said that members of her group had been in discussions with the government about the future of Gazprom Energy. The Federation of Small Businesses said that it had been warning the government for weeks that energy-intensive companies, from steel to fertiliser, could face financial issues if Gazprom is put into special measures. Richard Leese, the chair of the Energy Intensive Users Group, said that businesses that had hedged big price increases in the market with deals with Gazprom Energy needed to be protected. “It’s really important that those healthy businesses, that have taken the responsible thing to do, which is hedge their energy exposure, and did it with Gazprom, that needs to be honoured in terms of contractual obligations,” Leese told a panel of lawmakers on Tuesday. “The prices need to be honoured when, or if, that business gets transferred to an administrator or new ownership.” In a statement on its website, Gazprom Energy said that it was in contact with industry regulators but was not aware of any plans to move the company to government-controlled special administration. “We are in constant contact with the relevant regulators and are unaware of any decision taken to place Gazprom Energy under government control,” it said. “As one of the largest active members of the GB gas market, Gazprom Energy takes its responsibilities to ensure stability and protect customers seriously. Ofgem must consider all possible scenarios and formulate plans to respond to whatever events unfold – this is entirely normal.”",News/Business,Ofgem plans for Gazprom Energy takeover after customer exodus,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/22/ofgem-plans-for-gazprom-energy-takeover-after-customer-exodus
3/23/2022,"A trophy hunting import ban will be brought forward in coming months despite opposition from Conservative backbenchers, the environment secretary has said. George Eustice told animal welfare campaigners of the commitment after rumours that a bill banning the import of parts of endangered animals shot abroad had been stopped. The trophy hunting import ban was a Tory manifesto commitment for this parliamentary session. Eustice said the government was “absolutely committed to” bringing the bill forward. The government has said the bill has been delayed, claiming parliament does not have enough time this session to pass the law. Eustice said it would be a priority piece of legislation when the new session opens later in spring. “While we won’t be introducing the animals abroad bill in this session as we are out of time, we will be looking at a range of vehicles for legislation on these important issues in the next session,” said Eustice. However, he added that the pledged bans on imports of fur and foie gras, which have been hugely unpopular with backbenchers including Jacob Rees-Mogg, are not a sure thing. Eustice said: “I know you’re probably going to ask me what’s going to happen on fur and foie gras but I can’t do that today.” Government sources have said the proposed bans are to be stripped from the animals abroad bill. Instead, they will likely have to be brought forward as private members’ bills, sponsored by individual MPs, and will no longer be a Conservative party commitment. Queen guitarist and animal welfare campaigner Brian May said he was disappointed by the government weakening animal welfare legislation. He told the Guardian: “I am disappointed. I’m always disappointed when it comes to animal welfare bills. We need to look at our attitude when it comes to animals – there’s so much talk by this government, they’re always making grand promises, but there’s so little action. Time and time again legislation which would protect animals is torpedoed. Or they take bits out and make it toothless and not fit for purpose.”",News/UK news,UK trophy hunting import ban to be brought forward,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/22/uk-trophy-hunting-import-ban-to-be-brought-forward
3/23/2022,"Do try to be appear calm when putting your baby in their cot, even if it’s the last thing you feel. Don’t get obsessed with them having daytime naps. Do have a consistent wake time. And above all, sleep experts say, try not to feel guilty or anxious if your little one is waking up time and again through the night. That is half the battle, said Prof Helen Ball, director of Durham University’s Infancy and Sleep Centre. A fractious baby really is a normal baby. “People do feel as if they must be doing something wrong. That they must be parenting improperly somehow. “The ones who sleep through the night from an early age and never wake up, they are very rare. Although they are the only ones you ever hear about.” The centre will next week launch a new kit for NHS health professionals that they hope will help new parents better deal with sleepless nights. Sleep – or the lack of it – is one of the main concerns new parents have, yet NHS health visitors and community nurses receive little or no training on the subject. Research showed that practitioners did not feel confident discussing strategies with parents, said Ball. “The only recourse they had really was to their own experience.” Ball said popular beliefs that babies should sleep through the night still held sway but were based on studies conducted in the 1950s and 1960s when babies routinely slept in another room so parents could be unaware of their baby waking up. “We know that it’s normal for babies to wake and feed at night throughout at least the first year.” The new guidance, Sleep, Baby & You, is based on the Australian Possums Sleep Program, which teaches parents to manage expectations, to reduce negative thinking and encourages responsive infant care. “Some of it is about framing what is normal or reframing expectations about what is normal and what we don’t need to be anxious about,” said Ball. “Some of it is helping parents on how to cope. As in … ‘If this is normal and we’ve got to deal with this, how are we actually going to cope with this for several months?’” It includes practical guidance and tips. For example, the importance of a baby being dialled down in order to fall asleep. If you are wound up then the baby will pick up on that, said Ball. “You might have to act calm even if you’re not calm.” Babies really like comfort and contact so cuddle the baby until they calm down and don’t put them in the cot as they’re screaming. Health professionals should encourage parents to avoid an obsession with daytime naps and suggest that naps happen on the go. Ball said having a consistent wake time was more important than having one for bed time. “There’s lots of information about how sleep works that the general public often hasn’t encountered before,” she said. The guidance is important, Ball said, because lack of sleep “has been linked to increased symptoms of depression and anxiety among new mothers and fathers”. It differs from the various forms of sleep training that exist, easily found online or available privately, which give tips on how to get baby to settle down during the night. Some methods favour the baby being in a separate room and parents not responding when the baby cries. Others talk about popping in to see them at increasingly longer intervals. Others say the baby should be in the same room but you’re not meant to respond when they wake. “Many parents don’t like the idea of not being responsive when their child is requesting their help or attention,” said Ball. “They don’t want sleep training but they want to know what else can they do.” The guide will be launched at the centre’s annual conference on Monday, which will celebrate 22 years of world-leading research into infant sleep. Ball said she and the centre had been working on the training tool, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, for nearly four years. “I wanted to find a support programme that NHS staff could use to help parents who are struggling with infant sleep.”",News/Society,Crib sheet: experts issue advice for new parents to cope with sleepless nights,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/22/crib-sheet-experts-issue-advice-for-new-parents-to-cope-with-sleepless-nights
3/23/2022,"Communication within government during the pandemic was often by instant messaging, such as by WhatsApp, a senior Cabinet Office official has accepted, as it emerged that a series of messages have been lost from Boris Johnson’s phone. The messages were lost in April 2021 amid security precautions when it was found that the prime minister’s phone number was listed on the internet, according to a statement by Sarah Harrison, chief operating officer at the Cabinet Office. “The effect was that historic messages were no longer available to search and the phone is not active,” she wrote in a witness statement prepared for a court challenge by the Good Law Project and the Citizens, a non-profit media organisation, over the use of private messaging in government. Among messages that would have been lost were ones with Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s then-chief adviser, in March 2021, which Cummings later presented in screenshot form, illustrating what he said was dysfunction amid the start of the Covid pandemic. The loss of the messages comes despite official guidance, set out by Harrison in the statement, that ministers are “required to make a separate record of any conversation” relevant to work, and reminding them about an “export” function so conversations can be saved. No 10 has a dedicated team that maintains both hard and electronic copies of relevant documents, her statement added, while WhatsApp is only allowed “for ephemeral chat and/or unclassified material. “Users are expected to preserve any data for the public record that may be on WhatsApp or private email accounts where it should be copied [and moved to No 10 records],” she wrote, adding that No 10 staff are “constantly reminded of their responsibilities concerning the accurate keeping and capture of electronic records”. Her statement sets out how much communication moved to electronic messaging amid remote working during Covid, often through WhatsApp groups. “These WhatsApp groups were used for informal discussions between the participants,” it said. “These are the equivalent to the conversation that might previously have taken place in corridors, or in passing, had there not been a shift to remote working in line with the government’s guidance at that time. “I have been reassured by No 10 officials that any relevant actions from these WhatsApp groups were copied across to formal channels and the official record where appropriate.” The statement notes that there is also “some limited use” of ministers using private emails, mainly when travelling, and that two unnamed ministers use the secure chat service Signal “for informal conversations”. Both groups had challenged the government over the use of informal communications, and the risk to permanent record-keeping of decisions. In a statement, the Good Law Project said: “Given the current ‘partygate’ investigation, as well as the future inquiry into the government’s response to the pandemic, this has serious implications for transparency and holding the prime minister and his government to account.” Johnson’s official spokesperson said he would not get into the “levels of communication” used by the prime minister but that “there are rules and guidelines” that were followed: “Those conversations can happen as long as any requisite information is provided to [their] private office and passed on, and that’s what takes place when it comes to the prime minister.”",News/Law,"Government work often done on WhatsApp during Covid, says top official ",https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/22/government-work-often-done-on-instant-messages-during-covid-says-top-official
3/23/2022,"Russian forces have only three further days of fuel, food and ammunition left to conduct the war after a breakdown in their supply chains, Ukrainian military commanders have alleged. The claims of major shortages were described as “plausible” by western officials although they said they were unable to corroborate the analysis. The report from the Ukrainian armed forces general command was said to be consistent with evidence that the Russian advance had stalled, and that they had reverted to using “indiscriminate and attritional” artillery attacks on civilians. “We do think that the Russian forces have used a lot of material including particular categories of weapons and we have seen isolated reports of particular units that have lacked supplies of one sort or another,” the official said. “It is consistent with an advance which has ground to a halt. Failures in the logistic chain has been one of the reasons they have not been as effective as they hoped.” A Pentagon official added there were continuing morale issues among Russian troops, with food and fuel shortages, as well as frostbite due to a lack of adequate clothing. “They’re struggling on many fronts,” the US official said. The Ukrainian military said that a major problem for the Russian advance was a failure to lay down a fuel pipe to the front, although the claim could not be independently verified. On Monday, Komsomolskaya Pravda, the pro-Kremlin tabloid, reported that according to Russian defence ministry numbers, 9,861 Russian soldiers had been killed in Ukraine and 16,153 were injured. The death toll was swiftly removed from the newspaper’s website. Western officials said they believed the numbers cited by the newspaper are a “reasonable estimate”. The official said: “It is a level of casualties that has not been experienced [by Russia] really since the second world war. It is still continuing … it is a conflict on a different scale.” While Vladimir Putin’s forces have struggled around Kyiv, a senior US official said the fighting had been taken to the streets in Mariupol, where many civilians remain trapped among rotting corpses and flattened buildings. Two “super powerful bombs” hit the city on Tuesday even as rescue efforts were ongoing, local authorities said. The port city is said to be under naval shelling from ships in the Sea of Azov. Russians are said to want to be able to declare Mariupol as a first strategic victory. The city is seen as key to securing a Russian corridor between the separatist Donbas region and illegally annexed Crimea. It is also home to the largest trading port in the Azov Sea from which Ukraine exports grain, iron and steel, and heavy machinery.

3/23/2022,"Manu Tuilagi is back in contention for selection this weekend according to his Sale Sharks coach, Alex Sanderson, who also conceded that the England centre was “rushed back” to the international fold in time for the Six Nations. “It needed a more graduated return to play, in terms of his loading, for him to take on [the] load he couldn’t handle that week,” Sanderson said of Tuilagi, who was selected to start against Wales after only 81 minutes of rugby following a three-month absence but then sustained a hamstring injury in training. “Is that being rushed?” Sanderson asked. “Yes, in hindsight, I guess there’s no other way around it. He got injured, so we have to look at how he was managed. We are going to sit down with England, have another conversation about how we can get him through to [next year’s] World Cup fit and strong.” Tuilagi’s return is welcome news for club and country. England sorely missed his physicality and direct running in midfield, tellingly utilising the prop Ellis Genge as their primary ball carrier against France in Paris last Saturday. Sale, meanwhile, are seventh in a tightly packed Premiership table and play Bristol across two ties in the European Champions Cup round of 16 next month. Before that they have league games against Harlequins and Saracens as well as the trip to Bath this weekend. Sanderson was evidently delighted to have “one of the world’s best centres”, as he called Tuilagi, back in the ranks. “He’s the glue off the field and forever a positive, smiley face,” Sanderson said. “On it he’s a wrecking ball. We talked a bit at the start of this week about how we can challenge each other at this business end of the season. That’s what he does. People grow a few inches around him and we get tighter as a squad. We’re very lucky to have him back.” Sanderson’s upbeat demeanour shifted when talking about Tom Curry. The England loose forward will be out for five to six weeks with a grade two hamstring tear, but may be back in time for a possible Champions Cup quarter-final. “He’s had a torrid time, hasn’t he?” Sanderson said of Curry who battled through a bout of tonsillitis in the same week he was made England captain for the opening game of the Six Nations against Scotland. Curry also missed the second half against Wales after failing a head injury assessment. Sanderson was quick to point out that Curry was not the only England player who struggled during the tournament and noted the physical and psychological impact can stay with them once they return to their clubs. “I’ve had past experience of seeing Saracens lads come back elated, sometimes full of themselves because of what they’ve achieved and the attention they received,” said Sanderson, who worked as an assistant coach with Saracens between 2008 and 2021. “At other times, like Maro Itoje would be the first to admit, it was probably the worst moment in his life losing that World Cup final, it took him a year to get over. You’ve got to go through that journey with them and get them out the other side.” Sanderson welcomed back two other England players this week but neither stepped on the field throughout the Six Nations. The Sale director of rugby is not worried about the prop Bevan Rodd, who he said would brush off the disappointment like “water off a duck’s back”. He did, however, express concern over Raffi Quirke. “Raffi took it quite hard, his expectations of where he was in the autumn, wanting to play, that’s something we’ll work through,” Sanderson said, but said he would be better for the experience of training in the England camp. The young scrum-half is not guaranteed a starting place on Saturday. Standing in his way is the World Cup‑winning Springbok Faf de Klerk. “We said we’d pick them on merit, on training form and playing form, we’ve done that,” Sanderson said. “There isn’t a lot to choose between them, aside from the experience.” Quirke may not have this problem for long. Both De Klerk and his countryman Lood de Jager have been rumoured to be leaving at the end of the season, though Sanderson would not budge: “Until the official media statement has been put out there, you’ll get nothing hot off the press from me.”",Sport/Sport,‘We’re lucky to have him back’: Manu Tuilagi in line for Sale return,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/22/were-lucky-to-have-him-back-manu-tuilagi-in-line-for-sale-return
3/23/2022,"My father, Lloyd Williams, who has died aged 84 after suffering from Covid-19 and heart problems, was 22 when he was first elected to the parish council in Waen, north Wales. He went on to give more than 60 years of service to his local community as a parish, borough and county councillor, and as a highly respected chair of all three councils. Waen is a hamlet near St Asaph, Denbighshire. Lloyd was born there, to Jane (nee Evans) and John Williams, both farmers; he had two older brothers and an adored half-sister who had severe disabilities. He would walk two miles each day to the village school in Rhuallt and later went to St Asaph grammar school. Intelligent and hard-working, he passed the “school certificates” with distinction and wanted to study to be a vet, but as for most at that time he had to leave school to work on the farm. Lloyd’s service to others was guided by his quiet and gentle faith. People sought his advice on different matters, knowing they would receive a sympathetic ear and help. Many were discreetly given financial support. Lloyd believed that everyone should have the same opportunities whatever their background. He opposed the selling of local authority housing, believing young families would have no opportunity to live and work in their local area and dormitory villages would result, a prophecy that was sadly realised. He campaigned successfully in the early 1990s for the Rhuallt bypass to be built on the A55. The B-road through the village had caused many fatalities, and Lloyd invited the Welsh secretary of state to visit and to see how a small rural road was unsuitable to carry the hundreds of thousands of cars travelling into north Wales. Conservation and stewardship were very important to him.

3/23/2022,"The American rapper Pusha T has issued an extraordinary attack on McDonald’s, releasing a diss track with a rival fast-food chain, Arby’s. The 75-second song was inspired, the rapper told Rolling Stone, by resentment over what he claims is McDonald’s failure to pay him and his brother properly for their part in writing and performing the famous I’m Lovin’ It jingle. In the diss track (essentially a rap that attacks a target, usually another rapper), Pusha T criticises McDonald’s Filet-O-Fish while promoting Arby’s Spicy Fish Sandwich. “I’m the reason the whole world love it, now I gotta crush it,” he raps. He also says the Filet-O-Fish is “shit” and adds: “You should be disgusted / How dare you sell a square fish asking us to trust it / A half slice of cheese, Mickey D’s on a budget?” The origins of the I’m Lovin’ It McDonald’s jingle are disputed. It was released in 2003 and features rapping by Pusha T and his brother Malice, whose stage name is No Malice. Pharrell Williams and Justin Timberlake are also credited, the latter having been paid $6m for a full song of the same name. In the interview with Rolling Stone about his defection to the Arby’s camp, Pusha T said McDonald’s only paid him and his brother a one-time fee, with no royalties, for their work on the seminal ad. “I am solely responsible for the I’m Lovin’ It swag and the jingle of that company,” the rapper said. “That’s just real. I am the reason. Now I gotta crush it. “I did it at a very young age, at a very young time in my career where I wasn’t asking for as much money and ownership. It’s something that’s always dug at me later in life like, ‘Dammit, I was a part of this and I should have more stake.’ “It was like half a million or a million dollars for me and my brother – but that’s peanuts for as long as that’s been running. I had to get that energy off me and this [Arby’s ad] was the perfect way to get that energy, like, ‘You know what? I’m over it.’” According to a Pitchfork article published in 2016, other artists credited with creating the track deny Pusha T was involved. In his own interview with Pitchfork, Pusha T said: “It’s funny that people find it so amusing now that I wrote that.” By Tuesday afternoon the pro-Arby’s track, which the rapper shared with Twitter followers on Monday, had racked up more than 4.4m views. “Drowned in tartar, that Filet-O-Fish is tasteless,” Pusha-T raps. “Arby’s only deals in the greatness. I bet the house on it like it’s Vegas.” The rapper tweeted: “Just dropped a diss track with Arby’s. Grab some popcorn and a Spicy Fish Sandwich. #ArbysPaidMeButIWouldSayThisAnyway.”",Arts/Music, Pusha T releases McDonald’s diss track over alleged failure to pay for jingle ,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/22/pusha-t-mcdonalds-diss-track-arbys
3/23/2022,"An extreme heat event in the Arctic could cause it to reach the maximum of the extent of its ice for this year “considerably earlier” than usual, a scientist has warned. Temperature records were broken in Norway last week, with rain falling at Svalbard airport, and unusually warm temperatures recorded in Greenland and the Russian archipelago of Franz Josef Land. Some stations reportedly reached 30C warmer than usual for the Arctic winter. The situation was echoed at the south pole, with Concordia station, on the Antarctic Plateau, hitting a record -11.8C on Friday, more than 40C warmer than usual for this time of year. “It is unusual to have such large departures from average occur at the same time at both poles, and in the Arctic it may have led to the maximum sea ice extent reached considerably earlier than average,” said Prof Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London (UCL). Arctic sea ice extent was tracking well below the 1981 to 2010 median, according to data published by the US National Snow and Ice Data Center. On 21 March, it spread across 14.5m sq km (5.6m sq miles) compared with a 15.5m sq km historical average. The NSIDC’s graph showed levels were also tracking below those seen in 2012, when Arctic sea ice hit its lowest ever extent. However, ice extent was greater than that seen at this time of year in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, and broadly in line with levels in 2019 and 2021. Similar extents were also seen in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2011. Stroeve was cautious about attributing the extreme heat events to the climate crisis. “While we may expect such warming extremes to occur more frequently under climate change, it is too early to say this particular event is related to climate change,” she said. “Weather is always unpredictable. And it’s important to remember that air temperatures, while warmer than average, remain below zero.” Dr Lisa Schipper, co-ordinating lead chapter author for the IPCC sixth assessment report and Oxford environmental research fellow, said: “The IPCC report on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability released in February underscores that the window of opportunity to act on climate is rapidly closing. “If these extreme temperatures don’t wake people up about this urgency, at the same time as war threatens to encourage more fossil fuel extraction and use, I don’t know what will.”",News/Environment,Arctic sea ice could hit maximum extent ‘much earlier’ than usual,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/22/arctic-sea-ice-could-hit-maximum-extent-much-earlier-than-usual
3/23/2022,"Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, has tested positive for Covid-19 and will not travel to Europe with Joe Biden for meetings in Brussels and Poland this week. In a statement on Tuesday afternoon, Psaki said she had met twice with Biden, 79, on Monday but he had tested negative the following day. “In preparation for travel to Europe,” Psaki said, “I took a PCR test this morning. That test came back positive, which means I will be adhering to CDC guidance and no longer be traveling on the president’s trip to Europe. “I had two socially distanced meetings with the president yesterday, and he is not considered a close contact as defined by CDC guidance. I am sharing the news of my positive test today out of an abundance of transparency. The president tested negative today via PCR test. “Thanks to the vaccine, I have only experienced mild symptoms. In alignment with White House Covid-19 protocols, I will work from home and plan to return to work in person at the conclusion of a five-day isolation period and a negative test.” Biden is vaccinated and boosted. Psaki, his chief voice in the media, has tested positive for Covid before, in October last year. More than 972,000 people have died of Covid in the US. Most public health restrictions have been relaxed, under new federal policy aimed at focusing on areas where hospital resources are under strain. Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser, said on Sunday he expected to see cases rise thanks to the BA.2 Omicron virus subvariant, but he did not expect that the US would experience a dangerous new surge. “We’re still in this,” the 81-year-old said of the pandemic which began in early 2020. “We have a way to go.

3/23/2022,"Environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg denounced as “racist” and “colonial” the decision by the Swedish government on Tuesday to allow a British company to dig an open-cast iron ore mine on land belonging to the indigenous Sami people. Beowulf Mining, headquartered in London, has fought for nearly a decade to win approval for the mine, but has consistently faced stiff opposition from Sami and environmentalists. The Gállok site, 45km from the town of Jokkmokk in Swedish Sápmi, commonly known as Lappland, has become a symbol of the tension between business and government on one hand, and the protected status of Sami culture. Announcing the decision on Tuesday, the business minister, Karl-Petter Thorwaldsson, said the mine was in the public interest. He stressed that permission came with a number of “far-reaching conditions” to minimise the impact on reindeer husbandry, compliance with which was essential. These include commitments to arrange transport for migrating animals, compensate reindeer herders and restore the land after exploitation. But critics of the mine responded furiously. “Sweden today confirmed its shortsighted, racist, colonial and nature-hostile approach,” Thunberg, who is Swedish, posted on Twitter. “Sweden pretends to be a leader for environment and human rights, but at home they violate indigenous rights and continue waging a war on nature. The world will remember this.” Amnesty International Sweden said it “deeply regretted” the decision, noting concerted opposition to the mine from the Sami parliament, UN experts, Unesco, the Church of Sweden, the Swedish environmental protection agency, Sweden’s national heritage board and others. Märta Stenevi, spokesperson for Sweden’s Green party, said on Twitter that the decision to give the go-ahead for the Gállok mine was a “tragedy for Sami rights, nature and future generations … Short-term economic gain is now put before Sami rights, animals and nature. Incredible.” Beowulf’s share price had been on a sharp upward trajectory since December when the Swedish Greens, who have opposed the plans, left the governing coalition. Thorwaldsson declared that his party “loved mines” and hoped to open more. However, the share price fell sharply following claims by a Swedish newspaper earlier this month that Beowulf lacked the necessary funds to develop the mine and had links to an offshore tax haven. The company strongly denied the claims, while its chairman dismissed them as biased. Welcoming the government’s decision, the Beowulf chief executive, Kurt Budge, said in a statement: ”Beowulf’s ambition is to build the most sustainable mine possible. … The company remains committed to working constructively – and in good faith – with all stakeholders and engaging in meaningful dialogue.” The Sami parliament, the representative body for people of indigenous heritage in Sweden, says the mine will destroy grazing areas and cut off the only viable migratory route for reindeer followed by the Jåhkågasska Sami community, who move westerly with their animals to the high hills of the Laponian area on the Norwegian border for the animals to calve during the spring. However, the promise of hundreds of new jobs created by the mine has divided the local community in Jokkmokk, who fear economic decline and a continuing exodus of people from the area.",News/Environment,Thunberg condemns ‘racist’ decision to allow UK firm to mine on Sami land,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/22/greta-thunberg-condemns-racist-decision-to-allow-uk-firm-to-mine-on-sami-land
3/23/2022,"The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, has said it is time for Russia to end its “absurd” and “unwinnable” war in Ukraine, as the EU prepared to set up a “trust fund” aimed at helping Kyiv repel the invasion and rebuild afterwards. Speaking to reporters at the UN’s headquarters in New York, Guterres said the war was “going nowhere, fast”. For more than two weeks, the devastated southern city of Mariupol had been encircled by Russian forces, bombed and shelled, he said. “For what?” he asked. “Even if Mariupol falls, Ukraine cannot be conquered city by city, street by street, house by house.” Guterres said the only outcome to more fighting was “more suffering, more destruction, and more horror”. Negotiators from Moscow and Kyiv have held several rounds of peace talks that have so far made little headway towards ending nearly four weeks of fighting, which have left thousands dead and displaced more than 10 million people. “There is enough on the table to cease hostilities now and seriously negotiate now,” he said. “This war is unwinnable. Sooner or later, it will have to move from the battlefield to the peace table. That is inevitable.” Leaders from the 27-nation EU gather in Brussels on Thursday, meanwhile, to discuss the bloc’s further response to Moscow’s onslaught, including a longer-term financial support mechanism for Ukraine beyond €1.2bn in emergency funding already agreed. According to a draft document seen by Agence-France Presse, the EU will commit to “provide support to the Ukrainian government for its immediate needs and, once the Russian onslaught has ceased, for the reconstruction of a democratic Ukraine”. The document did not provide details on the size of the Ukraine solidarity trust fund or how it might work, but said the European council expected preparations to start “without delay” and would call an international conference to raise cash. The US president, Joe Biden, is also due to travel to Brussels this week for Nato and G7 talks to discuss further action, including tighter sanctions on Russia. Biden discussed Moscow’s “brutal” tactics in a call with European leaders on Monday. Boris Johnson is expected to tell allies at the Nato summit that there is an immediate imperative to support the Ukrainians now, and that the Russian tactics using indiscriminate fire on civilian centres is inherently escalatory. The UK will make the case that new action is needed amid Russia’s increased bombardment of cities such as Mariupol, and urge allies that they should consider this an escalation that requires a response including an increase in the flow of weapons to Ukraine that would improve their ability to resist. Western officials are keen to avoid a view forming amongst allies that only use of chemical or biological weapons are considered a further escalation, rather than the increased indiscriminate shelling into civilian populations, which the UK believes could merit a further response. The Commission on Wednesday will also set out plans to ensure that the more than 3.5 million refugees who have fled the Russian invasion have access to jobs, education and housing, vice-president Maros Sefcovic said on Tuesday. The bloc’s initial actions focused on receiving Ukrainians at the border, but “now we must ensure the right resources are in place to meet their needs,” Sefcovic said after a meeting of European affairs ministers in Brussels. Addressing the Italian parliament in Rome, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said that for Russian forces “Ukraine is the gates of Europe, where they want to break in, but barbarism must not be allowed to pass”. He again called for more help to defeat his country’s invaders. Zelenskiy warned that one potential consequence of the war was “famine that is approaching for some countries”. Ukraine had “always been one of the largest food exporters”, he said, “but how can we sow crops under the strikes of Russian artillery?” In an interview with European broadcasters late on Monday, Zelenskiy said an end to the war would only be negotiated if he met Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, and repeated his acknowledgement that Ukraine could not now secure Nato membership. Responding to the Ukrainian leader, Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi, said Ukraine had offered “heroic” resistance to the invading Russian forces and Italy would support its bid to join the EU, which Kyiv has long said it wants to do. Draghi said EU accession was a lengthy process because of the reforms needed to integrate fully with the bloc, but added: “I want to say to President Zelenskiy that Italy is at Ukraine’s side in this process. Italy wants Ukraine in the EU.” The EU has collectively imposed several rounds of sanctions on Moscow and agreed €1bn in financing for weapons for Ukraine’s military, but cracks are beginning to appear in the bloc’s unity over further measures, including a ban on Russia’s key energy exports. Combined western sanctions have cut Russia out of most international trade to a degree never imposed on such a large economy, but exceptions have been been carved out for Russian energy exports to Europe, its biggest oil and gas customer. Several member states insist they still rely too heavily on Russian gas and oil to be able halt all energy imports immediately. In an effort to cut EU consumption of Russian gas, leaders are also set to agree at this week’s Brussels summit to collectively buy gas, LNG and hydrogen elsewhere.",News/World news,UN says it’s time for Russia to end ‘unwinnable’ war in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/eu-aims-to-set-up-trust-fund-for-reconstruction-of-democratic-ukraine
3/23/2022,"Across the United States on Monday evening, many Americans asked a simple question: what is the American Song Contest? The all-live NBC music competition, which aired its two-hour premiere last night, attempts to bring Eurovision to the US. That’s not necessarily an easy task; despite its track record of success overseas – you can thank Eurovision for Abba and Celine Dion – the 65-year-old annual song tournament is not widely understood in the US. Whereas Eurovision showcases one artist ra country and offers a web of political intrigue and often untranslatable local culture, the American version, somehow not called “Amerivision”, pits original songs by 56 artists from all 50 US states, five territories (Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, US Virgin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands) and the nation’s capital in a bracket-style showdown. The multi-step competition will air over the course of six weeks. American Song Contest, hosted by Kelly Clarkson (the first-ever winner of American Idol) and Snoop Dogg, has the backing of the European competition’s producers and a showrunner, Audrey Morrissey, who executive-produced NBC’s highly successful singing competition The Voice. It has legions of Eurovision fans curious as to what, exactly, differentiates the US states and territories. It has a process that combines the votes of an expert jury panel with fan votes on NBC’s website and on TikTok. (According to Variety, the 56 jury members – one from each state/territory, including a former member of the band the Fray and the president of iHeartMedia – are supposed to evaluate each performance based on “artistic expression, hit potential, originality and visual impression”.) And it has a March Madness-style series of rounds pitting artists with various levels of name recognition and professional experience against each other. Established stars such as Michael Bolton (Connecticut) and Jewel (Alaska) will compete against amateurs (Michigan is sending is 16-year-old high-schooler, for example). So how did the games begin? The premiere packed a lot of enthusiasm and ginned-up state rivalries into a chaotic two hours. (Full disclosure: I’m from Ohio – shout-out to Macy Gray, the Grammy-winning R&B singer representing the Buckeye State – and the only Eurovision performance I’d seen before this was the unbeatable Latvian pirate group, so I entered pretty confused on the concept.) Clarkson and Snoop applied their signature energies – irresistible, maternal bubbliness for her, slightly stoned vibing for him – to short interstitials between the 11 performances. The (almost entirely upbeat) performances themselves reached for a full cornucopia of genres, from hip-hop to Latin pop to a country-rap earworm called New Boot Goofin’, courtesy of Wyoming’s Ryan Charles, that was seemingly designed for TikTok (it was the night’s clear social media winner.) The hosts only loosely explained the formula, so here are the logistics: the first five episodes will contain 11 performances each (one will have 12), from which one act will automatically advance based on the jury vote, announced at the night’s end. Fan votes will determine the other three acts to advance per episode, announced the following week. The two semi-final rounds will feature 22 acts total offering “slightly elevated” performances of their original songs, according to NBC. Ten artists will make the grand final, where a combination of jury and fan votes will determine the winner. Back to the initial crop of competitors, representing areas of the country as geographically different as tropical Puerto Rico and frozen Wisconsin. Overall, the evening was a mixed bag of quality – to be fair, it is very difficult to sing live in a studio, especially when some of the artists hadn’t performed for more than a couple of thousand people – though Clarkson was uniformly excited and Snoop bopped to every song. Several of the artists explained their styles through mashups of famous stars. Pink-haried Alisabeth Von Presley of Iowa described herself as if Lady Gaga and Pat Benatar collided and exploded into a pile of glitter; Rhode Island’s Hueston said he was Chris Stapleton mixed with Adele and Sons of Anarchy, “but in a good way”; Wisconsin’s Jake’O, black hair slicked back like Elvis, coined his style “nuvo-retro”. Some played to the expectations from their state: Minnesota’s entry, the pop-boy band Yam Haus, consisted of four very earnest white guys embodying “Minnesota nice” (“Ope!”). Mississippi’s Keyone Starr, who has recorded with Mark Ronson, paid homage to her state’s rich history of black musical traditions – delta blues, gospel, rock’n’roll – with a fiery performance heavy on belting and guitar. Arkansas’s Kelsey Lamb sang a pretty conventional country ballad in a wide-brimmed hat. Michael Bolton, very sincerely of Connecticut, sang an earnest Michael Bolton song called Beautiful World. But there were also several conscious efforts to surprise and complicate the image of different regions of the country, and to highlight the diversity of American musical talent. AleXa, an established K-pop artist used to performing to large crowds in South Korea (you could tell – she owned the stage, and the hosts knew it), said that because she’s from Tulsa, Oklahoma, people expected her to wear a cowboy hat and sing country music. Her choreography-intense performance of Wonderland was the highlight of the evening. Indiana’s UG Skywalkin’, real name Josh Kimbowa, is an immigrant (the UG represents Uganda) openly striving to put Indianapolis’s hip-hop scene on the map. Puerto Rico’s entry, Christian Pagán, sang in English and Spanish in a leather pop-punk outfit. The night’s jury winner, Rhode Island’s Hueston, pushed against the state’s image of sun-soaked beaches and tourism by speaking about his tough blue-collar upbringing and the loss of friends to addiction. That intentional steering of the spotlight is perhaps the best argument for American Song Contest. The performances were almost secondary to the three- to five-minute intro videos, which offered lesser-publicized slices and experiences of the country a moment to connect and expound. This is particularly exciting for the territories, which many Americans know very little about, if they even know they exist as part of the US at all. As chaotic and haphazard as American Song Contest was last night and is likely to be, that opportunity for low-stakes exposure is a worthwhile one. That exposure may be more limited than NBC hoped. The premiere garnered just under 3m viewers, less than the new episode of ABC’s long-running American Idol, broadcast at the same time. So, Eurovision fans probably want Americans to want this. Several NBC executives and a 56-member panel of music industry figures want Americans to want this. But do Americans want their own Eurovision? We’ve got six more weeks to see.",Arts/Television & radio,American Song Contest: the US Eurovision is a chaotic copycat,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/22/american-song-contest-eurovision-nbc-copycat
3/23/2022,"Ketanji Brown Jackson gave a passionate defense of her sentencing of child sexual abuse imagery offenders as a rebuttal to attacks from a Republican senator who has accused her of endangering children, as her confirmation hearings for a seat on the US supreme court entered a critical second day. At the start of an epic day of questioning before the Senate judiciary committee on Capitol Hill, Jackson strongly rejected claims made by Josh Hawley, Republican senator from Missouri. The senator has spent several days advancing the theory that the Biden nominee, in her eight years as a federal district court judge, handed down sentences that were far more lenient than federal guidelines suggested or prosecutors requested. Hawley’s accusations have been debunked as misleading and false. On Tuesday, Jackson gave a personal response to the claims. “As a mother and a judge who has had to deal with these cases, nothing could be further from the truth,” Jackson said under questioning from Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic committee chair. She said child abuse cases were among the most difficult she dealt with as a judge, and described child sexual abuse imagery as a “sickening and egregious crime”. On the second day of hearings, each committee member was given 30 minutes to engage with Jackson. On Wednesday, they will get 20 minutes for follow-up questions. The final decision on confirmation will be made in a vote of the full Senate that is likely to be held by the first week in April. After a relatively amicable opening day, Jackson was facing up to 12 hours on Tuesday of possibly grueling interrogation from the 22-member committee, half of which is Republican. If confirmed, Joe Biden’s nominee would become the first Black woman to sit on the nation’s highest court in its more than two centuries of existence. At Durbin’s invitation, Jackson defended herself against the Republican attack line that she was soft in her legal approach to terrorist suspects held at the Guantánamo Bay military camp in Cuba. Jackson spent two years as a federal public defender and in that role represented some of the detainees in their bid for review of their cases. Jackson pointed out that her brother, Ketajh Brown, joined the US military in the wake of the terrorist attacks on 9/11. But she went on to say that American justice required all defendants to be represented and treated fairly. “That’s what makes our system the best in the world, that’s what makes us exemplars,” she said. The committee also scrutinised amicus briefs filed by Jackson before the supreme court relating to Guantánamo. Lindsey Graham, Republican senator from South Carolina, focused on a brief that argued that detainees held there indefinitely as “enemy combatants” should either be put up for trial or released. Graham said that if her argument had been accepted by the court it would have damaged the US war on terrorism. “This is not how you run a war,” he said. Jackson replied that she had been conveying the views of the private groups and thinktanks that she had been representing, not her own opinions. Graham also tried to impugn Jackson by association, pointing to progressive groups who had backed her nomination. He especially referred to groups that wanted to dilute conservative dominance of the supreme court by expanding the number of its justices. “Every group that wants to pack the court, that believes this court is a bunch of rightwing nuts that is going to destroy America, that considers the constitution trash – all wanted you picked … That is problematic for me,” Graham said. The nominee was asked by the committee to lay out her views on abortion. The subject is currently before the supreme court which is expected to dismantle the fundamental right to a termination enshrined in its own 1973 ruling Roe v Wade. Jackson said that she agreed with two of Trump’s appointees to the court, Brett Kavanaugh and Barrett, when they said in their respective confirmation hearings that Roe was settled law. She added that she believed that stare decisis – the legal principle of sticking with the court’s past precedent – was “very important”. John Cornyn, Republican senator from Texas, tried to puncture the stare decisis argument that Roe should be respected as established precedent by invoking Dred Scott, the 1857 supreme court ruling that stripped people of African descent of US citizenship, and Plessy v Ferguson, the 1896 ruling that approved racial segregation. “Thank goodness the supreme court has been willing to revisit its precedent, otherwise we’d still be living with Plessy and Dred Scott,” he said. Cornyn quizzed Jackson on her views about same-sex marriage and whether it was legitimate for the supreme court to have declared gay marriage legal in 2015. She said the court had decided that marriage equality was a right under the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. Cornyn riposted that five unelected justices had created a new fundamental right ignoring the will of voters. “We five members of the supreme court are going to decide what the law of the land should be, and anyone who disagrees with me will be labeled a bigot.”",News/US news,Ketanji Brown Jackson defends against Republican’s claims on child abuse sentences,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/22/ketanji-brown-jackson-defends-against-republican-josh-hawley-claims-child-abuse-sentences
3/23/2022,"Readers should applaud Aditya Chakrabortty’s article (Western values? They enthroned the monster who is shelling Ukrainians today, 17 March). The west’s failure to back Mikhail Gorbachev’s reforms and advocacy of reality led to the cataclysmic implosion of the Soviet Union and prevented the more gradual constitutional changes that would have provided stability. The US, supported by the UK government, rushed to push open the door into Russia and other Soviet republics to enable capitalists to feast on the Russian economy, and particularly its natural resources, when what was needed was a kind of Marshall plan to underpin the rouble and to assist the development of civil society. The consequences of that failure were apparent as early as 1990, when I was being asked in Moscow to advise on the immediate setting up of companies to make hay while the sun shone. It was even more apparent in 1996, when the oligarchs showed great disdain for the presidential election taking place that year. They told me that to them the result was irrelevant, such was their financial influence. This capitalist opportunism led to the collapse of the rouble in 1998, causing even more poverty among the Russian people. With Boris Yeltsin unable to stabilise the country, they inevitably looked for a strong nationalist leader. Ready in the wings was Vladimir Putin, and the rest is the sad history that has culminated in today’s Ukrainian horror. It is vital that we separate Putin and his regime from the Russian people, who rightly have a great pride in their cultural heritage. The west needs to understand and to respect that heritage, and to make it clear that our future relationship after Putin can be very different.Michael MeadowcroftLeeds  Gordon Brown and John Major have called for a Nuremberg-style tribunal to try Vladimir Putin and his associates for war crimes in Ukraine (19 March). The accused are not going to appear at such a tribunal voluntarily, and the west has no way of arresting them and compelling them to do so, therefore the call might be dismissed as futile. In fact, it is worse than that – it is positively counterproductive, since such arrests could be made only after the defeat and subjugation of Russia. That enables Putin to argue that those are the real aims of western policy, and that support for Ukraine is merely the means to that end. Such an argument will rally support among patriotic Russians, even those with qualms about the war. The call for a tribunal is yet another example of a western policy with what might appear to us to have laudable aims but with no attention paid to how it might be understood by the other side.Anthony MatthewLeicester  Aditya Chakrabortty’s article brings to mind the sage response that Mahatma Gandhi is said to have given to a journalist when asked what he thought of western civilisation: “I think it would be a very good idea.”Tony WildGalle, Sri Lanka  Many of your articles have marked 2014 as the beginning of Putin’s criminal campaign to re-vassalise Ukraine.

3/23/2022,"Measures taken by the Metropolitan police to tackle corruption are “fundamentally flawed” and “dire”, with continued failings down to arrogance, secrecy and lethargy, a devastating independent report has said. The report from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services was ordered after an independent panel criticised the Met for failings over the Daniel Morgan murder, where corruption hampered the hunt for the killers of the private detective. Morgan was found dead in 1987 in a pub car park in south London with an axe in his head. No one has been convicted of his murder. The inspectorate said many of the failings it identified in its latest report had been highlighted before, and Met promises to fix them had not been kept. Thirty-five years on from the killing, the Met had still not learned all the lessons, the inspectorate found, adding it was “inexcusable” and showed “indifference”. The inspectorate said: “In too many respects, the findings from our inspection paint a depressing picture. The force has sometimes behaved in ways that make it appear arrogant, secretive and lethargic. Its apparent tolerance of the shortcomings we describe in this report suggests a degree of indifference to the risk of corruption.” The Morgan family said its 35-year ordeal fighting the Met for justice amounted to “torture” and said so ingrained were Met failings its top team needed radical reform. The inspectors found the Met: Failed to properly supervise more than 100 recruits with criminal convictions or criminal connections, to lessen the risk they may pose. Those convictions include handling stolen goods, possession of drugs, assault and theft. The Met does not know if staff in highly sensitive posts, such as child protection, major crime investigation, and informant handling, are vetted to the right level. More than 2,000 warrant cards issued to former officers who are now not entitled to hold them are unaccounted for. Monitoring of IT systems, which helps identify potentially corrupt staff, remains weaker than it should be. Hundreds of items such as drugs, cash and exhibits are missing, with the arrangements and policies for keeping them safe branded as “dire”. The security code for a store was written on its door at one police station. Matt Parr, HM inspector of constabulary, said: “Corruption is almost certainly higher than the Met understands.” Parr added: “It is unacceptable that 35 years after Daniel Morgan’s murder, the Metropolitan police has not done enough to ensure its failings from that investigation cannot be repeated.” The findings from the inspectorate were so serious that several weeks ago the headlines were briefed to the home secretary, the Met commissioner and London mayor. The Morgan family, after decades in the wilderness, have found broad recognition in two official inquiries. They said: “Our experiences have taught us that the lack of will to address the sickness of police corruption is too deeply institutionalised within the Met to allow it to respond in any meaningful or constructive way to the inspectorate’s report. “We expect its leadership to retreat once more into its defensive shell, in denial of the evidence presented by the inspectorate’s report this year, just as it remained in denial of the findings of in the panel’s report last year. Unless and until we see root-and-branch changes in that leadership team, we consider we are unlikely to see any meaningful progress within the Met in relation to police corruption.” The panel set up by the government to look into Morgan’s murderreported last year and found the Met to be institutionally corrupt. In part, that was because the force was slow to hand over documents requested, and was accused of trying to cover up to protect its reputation instead of doing the right thing. The inspectorate concluded the Met was not institutionally corrupt and any hampering of the inquiry was not deliberate – but it was critical. It said: “We concluded that, at least until recently, the MPS [Metropolitan police service] has often shown a reluctance to examine, admit and learn from past mistakes and failures. “We concluded that the adverse matters … bore the hallmarks of limited resources allocated to the maintenance of professional standards, professional incompetence, a lack of understanding of important concepts, poor management or genuine error, rather than dishonesty.” The Morgan family said they believed “institutional corruption” perfectly described the Met and demanded that those who oversee Britain’s largest force, namely the home secretary and London mayor, stop glossing over its failings: “We call on them to stop turning a blind eye to those within the Met who – at best – deliberately turned away from the stench of police corruption; those who sought to manage the fallout from that corruption instead of confronting it.” After reports into racist and misogynistic messages swapped by officers at Charing Cross, and a string of other scandals, the inspectorate’s report is one of the final acts of Cressida Dick’s commissionership. She has announced her resignation, with public confidence plummeting during her five years in charge. The Met said it was improving, and added some criticisms it disagreed with: “We are determined that this report will serve as a further opportunity for us to learn and improve. In the past we have missed chances to reform more quickly, but in many other cases we have undertaken substantial changes to create a service unrecognisable to three decades ago.” The deputy commissioner, Sir Stephen House, said: “I take counter-corruption work very seriously. It is well resourced and we have been praised for our work in this area. This will continue. There are some areas where our judgment is different from the police inspectorate.” Both the home secretary, Priti Patel, and the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, have demanded the Met do better. Reports into potential failings that allowed Wayne Couzens to join the Met are expected later this year. While a serving Met officer, he used police powers to kidnap and murder Sarah Everard in March 2021.",News/UK news,"Daniel Morgan murder: Met anti-corruption measures ‘dire’, damning report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/22/daniel-morgan-damning-report-condemns-met-police
3/23/2022,"Tottenham have two clauses to buy Dejan Kulusevski from Juventus as part of their loan deal for the midfielder. Spurs paid €10m in January to borrow Kulusevski until June 2023, and are due to pay the Sweden international’s wages in full over that season and a half. But there is an option to turn the move into a permanent transfer this summer for €30m. The option will remain valid the following summer unless the second clause – a €35m mandatory buy clause – comes into play. That will be activated at the end of the 2022-23 season if two conditions are met during the campaign: that Kulusevski plays in 50% of the team’s Premier League matches for at least 45 minutes and Spurs qualify for the Champions League. Kulusevski is extremely happy at Tottenham and with life in London, boosted by his relationship with Antonio Conte. The manager had wanted to sign Kulusevski when in charge of Internazionale two years ago and approved when Fabio Paratici, the Spurs managing director of football, pursued January’s deal. Paratici, in his previous job, had brought Kulusevski to Juventus from Atalanta in 2020 for €35m plus €9m in add-ons and felt sure the player would thrive in the Premier League.",Sport/Football,Revealed: the deal Spurs struck with Juventus to buy Dejan Kulusevski,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/22/spurs-deal-with-juventus-to-buy-dejan-kulusevski-revealed

You’re still the same person, just one bit of you isn’t working very well.” I am suffering from long Covid, and if any doctor said this to me I’d be hurt and offended. Part of the agony of long Covid is that you really are not the person you were before. You lose a lot: work, leisure, maybe the ability to walk for a length of time. You may lose friends and relatives who cannot cope with the diagnosis and its implications. You’re undergoing a profound change that will no doubt impact on your sense of self for years. Anyone who says “don’t think differently about yourself” in this situation is a Panglossian fantasist.

3/23/2022,"The excellent points that George Monbiot makes are undermined by his narrative, which sets farmers against environmentalists (There are solutions to the food crisis. But ploughing up Britain isn’t one of them, 16 March). At best, he risks dividing those who would otherwise be allies and putting them into falsely opposing positions. At worst, it is a dangerous distraction while Nigel Farage et al, and the opaque sources of funding behind them, rush to undercut the hard-won progress for climate and nature, health and equity. Of course, we must manage the risk to food security as well as tackle the nature, climate and health crises. It is progressive farmers who are doing the real work in changing farming and food systems, by shifting to agroecological and regenerative practices. Agroecology, which allows for rewilding some agricultural land, removes overreliance on fossil fuels, synthetic chemicals and animal feeds. It is a growing movement that could build a fairer, more sustainable food system. Farmers – if given the right policy and market signals – have huge potential to be a force for change. The Ukraine war is the latest episode in a future of increasing geopolitical and ecological instability, characterised by competition for power and resources.

3/23/2022,"Bob Wellings, who has died aged 87 after a fall, was an “everyman” television presenter. He will be best remembered on Nationwide, the BBC’s early-evening news magazine programme, throughout the 1970s, his relaxed style and affable manner putting interviewees at their ease. It was populist TV with a mix of hard news and quirky, lighter items, covering subjects from industrial action to a skateboarding duck. The format was intended to unite viewers across Britain by following each region’s news bulletin with a national programme bringing together items from BBC studios around the UK. The frequent technical hitches, in an era before satellite, seemed only to increase viewers’ affections for the show. Wellings was first seen on Nationwide as a London and south-east of England reporter and presenter in early 1970. The programme had begun six months earlier, with Michael Barratt anchoring single-handedly. In 1971, Wellings was added as a co-presenter, with Frank Bough soon joining them. Others later at the helm of Nationwide included Sue Lawley, John Stapleton and Sue Cook. “As a Nationwide reporter, you had to be able to tackle anything, from interviewing, say, Edward Heath to some extraordinary animal,” Wellings recalled in the 1991 TV documentary Let’s Go Nationwide, before a clip of him with a piglet during his early days on the show. “Daft, really – and, of course, there’s no programme nowadays where that kind of thing could happen.” He then turned to a llama and asked: “I wonder if I could have your views on Tibet and the chances of its independence.” Alongside features on “ordinary” people, there were star interviews. After an exchange with Gregory Peck, the Hollywood actor said to him: “Mr Wellings, I do admire your tie. Could you tell me where you got it?” It turned out that Peck was opening a mayor’s gala in France and Wellings posted him an identical one. During 1973, Wellings also appeared weekly on That’s Life!, the consumer show presented by Esther Rantzen and originally billed as “a late-night collection of the jokes, dramas and problems that happen in real life” – like Nationwide it featured a mix of serious and light items. He and the actor George Layton were Rantzen’s co-presenters for that first series. In 1980, after 11 years on Nationwide – and three years before it was axed following more than 3,000 editions – Wellings was replaced by Richard Kershaw as the programme tried to become more serious. Wellings and Joan Bakewell then presented the regional show On the Town (1980-81), a Friday night look at entertainment in and around London. He was back in front of a national audience as a reporter on Nationwide’s shortlived successor, Sixty Minutes (1983-84), before being teamed with Eamonn Holmes and Pattie Coldwell to present Open Air (1986-89), with viewers venting their thoughts about the previous night’s television and wider TV issues. Wellings was born in Jerusalem, to Louise (nee Dalzell), an American from Texas, and Francis Wellings, the chief geologist of the Iraq Petroleum Company, originally from Shropshire. During the second world war, the family lived in the US, where Bob attended a military school, then moved to Amersham, Buckinghamshire, in 1947. On leaving Downside school, Somerset, he did national service in the RAF, then studied English at Trinity College, Cambridge, not taking his final exams but acting with the university’s Footlights Club. Failing to find a theatrical agent on auditioning with his mime and monologue act, Wellings worked as a “hack writer” for a children’s book publisher, taught at a boys’ prep school in Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucestershire, then found his way into television in 1959 when he landed a job with Anglia, ITV’s newly launched east of England franchise holder. He joined as a reporter on the regional news programme About Anglia, and later recalled being summoned by his producer after three weeks there and being told: “Bob, look, with most people who are new to television, our problem is to make them look relaxed. With you, we don’t have this problem – you just look … asleep!” Although he switched to the BBC’s South Today as a presenter in 1964, he returned to anchor Anglia’s news magazine from 1966 to 1969, as well as hosting other regional series. Wellings moved back to the BBC in 1970 and, following Nationwide and Sixty Minutes, presented the newly launched regional news programme London Plus from 1984 to 1985. His last nationally screened series, The Solent Way, in which he followed the route of Hampshire’s coastline, was broadcast in 1989. In 1963, Wellings married Pennie Tennyson; they divorced in 1984. He is survived by their daughters, Emma and Sophie, and son, Matthew.

3/23/2022,"At the moment the vividly-coloured pieces are dotted around Sandy Brown’s studio, a former sailmaking loft in the north Devon shipbuilding town of Appledore. In a few weeks they will be transported to a Cornish town and slotted together to become the tallest ceramic sculpture in the UK, possibly the world. Earth Goddess will soar 12 metres high over the town of St Austell, becoming south-west England’s answer to the Angel of the North. It is hoped the sculpture – made from materials as diverse as Appledore estuary mud and Cornish china clay – will draw tourists and give a further boost to the area’s growing reputation as a place to view and make art. “I’ve lived with her for two years,” Brown said as she gave the Guardian a sneak preview of the almost-finished work. “It will be sad to see her go. The place will feel a little empty without her.” Earth Goddess was commissioned as part of an art and regeneration project celebrating the amazing history of china clay in St Austell. The discovery of the material, used in the manufacture of a products including paper, rubber and paint, made St Austell the Silicon Valley of the 18th and 19th centuries. It created thousands of jobs and a striking addition to the landscape – the bright white and sharp-tipped spoil tips nicknamed the Cornish Alps. Earth Goddess is to be the centrepiece of a ceramic sculpture trail in the town. She began with what Brown described as a “doodle” in clay at her desk in the corner of her studio. “I wasn’t thinking or planning, just doodling, but as as far as I’m concerned that’s where the best stuff comes from.” What emerged was a “vaguely female form” – and the idea of a giant earth goddess. Brown took advice from an engineer friend who pointed out that the original shape she had envisaged was not practical because flat bits sticking out would catch the wind. So a sleeker, curvy form emerged. A limiting factor was the size of the studio kiln. Brown has one of the biggest in the UK but she had to make the body in 15 separate pieces to be able to fire them. Brown said she was confident Earth Goddess would be the biggest ceramic sculpture in the UK and she has yet to find a bigger one in the world. “I keep expecting people to tell me there is one, but they haven’t yet.” As well as being big, the sculpture is also very bright – a riot of swirling reds, yellows and cobalt oxide blues. Like the great Cornish potter Bernard Leach, Brown studied in Japan. While Leach is better known for more muted tones, Brown went down a brighter route. “When I started 50 years ago, there seemed to be a belief that studio ceramics should be brown. I preferred colour.” The sections are decorated with circles. “I call them rounds,” said Brown. “The circle is a symbol of unity, harmony – so it feeds into the idea of the earth goddess.” She has used china clay as a base layer. “It’s an extremely fine material and shows off the bright colours beautifully – it makes them shine.” Brown is currently working on tiles made out of china clay that will be used to create a base around the statue. They are coated in Appledore mud that she scoops from the river just in front of her house. “It’s creamy and buttery, it feels like you could spread it on toast,” she said. When fired, it turns a lovely rusty colour with golden flecks. Earth Goddess will be presented to the world at the start of April. “I can’t wait to see her installed,” said Brown. “I’ve got no idea what people will make of her. I hope they’ll be proud.”",Arts/Art and design,Artwork that will be UK’s tallest ceramic sculpture takes shape in Devon,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/22/artwork-that-will-be-uks-tallest-ceramic-sculpture-takes-shape-in-devon
3/23/2022,"Transparency campaigners have accused ministers of conducting “government by WhatsApp” in the UK’s third-highest court, arguing that the use of self-destructing messages on insecure platforms is unlawful and undemocratic. Ministers and government officials could be stopped from sending “disappearing messages” after failing to keep public records of exchanges on personal phones, email and WhatsApp. Some of those communications addressed matters of considerable public importance relating to the pandemic response and the awarding of government contracts. From Tuesday, two separate cases will be heard over three days, with a decision at a later date. The first case is brought by transparency campaigners All the Citizens (ATC) and non-profit Foxglove over the use of disappearing messages and auto-delete functions. The second case, brought by the Good Law Project, focuses on private devices. On Tuesday, the high court heard that the prime minister, Boris Johnson, has used personal WhatsApp accounts to communicate “critical decisions”. Ben Jaffey QC, representing ATC, said the messages could serve as a “public record for future societies” and that deletion does not adhere to “meaningful and parliamentary democracy”, allowing for “scrutiny through inquiries or court proceedings”.The campaigners are also seeking an end to a Cabinet Office policy of deleting messages sent on personal devices, in some cases using functions that auto-delete messages after seven days, which they argue breaches the Public Records Act. The government’s legal team contend that it is not unlawful for ministers to choose how they communicate, and the use of private devices is common in modern workplaces. Executive director of ATC, Clara Maguire, said the case was prompted by a refusal from the Cabinet Office to answer questions on the use of WhatsApp for government business, which contravenes government policy. She said: “It’s extraordinary that we’ve had to come to court to try and get answers. Our evidence reveals disappearing messages have been used time and again. This period, Boris Johnson’s government, will be a black hole for future historians.” Evidence submitted to the judge includes several witness statements in which key figures of government are named for their use of personal devices and auto-deletion. These include Johnson’s former chief adviser Dominic Cummings, half the permanent secretaries in the Cabinet Office, all the special advisers and most Cabinet Office ministers, including the former health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi.The evidence also shows that the prime minister requested summaries of his “red box” submissions by WhatsApp to his personal phone, even though No 10 policy prohibits the use of the platform for “non-trivial communications”. In their written arguments, the claimants’ lawyers contended that the “admitted instances of the use of automatic deletion are likely to be the tip of a much larger iceberg”. The government’s legal team has suggested that information in private accounts is “not, in principle, inaccessible” and can be retrieved on request, that although their use is discouraged it is not banned, and contend that “it is possible to operate automatic deletion lawfully and fairly”. In a written submission, they argued that “there is no principle” of common law stopping ministers or officials from communicating in a way “they consider appropriate”.They continued: “The claims advanced are detached from the reality of current working practices. The modern working age is defined by instant and fast-paced communications.” The cases continue.",News/Law,UK ministers accused of ‘government by WhatsApp’ in court,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/22/uk-ministers-accused-of-government-by-whatsapp-in-court
3/23/2022,"Forest fires have erupted in the vicinity of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, with Ukraine claiming that Russian control of the abandoned power plant is hampering efforts to control the flames. At least seven fires have been spotted within Chernobyl’s exclusion zone via satellite imagery taken by the European Space Agency, according to a statement by Ukraine’s parliament. The fires were probably ignited by the “armed aggression of the Russian federation”, the parliament said, although it’s not clear whether it was shelling, arson or some other factor that caused the outbreak. Fires like these within 10km of the plant are “particularly dangerous”, the statement added, with Ukraine claiming its firefighters are unable to tackle the blazes due to Russia’s presence. Russian forces captured the Chernobyl plant in the opening days of the invasion of Ukraine in February. The site is known for a 1986 explosion and resulting fire that caused a major nuclear disaster, spreading radioactive contamination across Europe. The plant and surrounding area have largely been sealed off since then. However, about 200 tons of fuel remain at the bottom of the crippled reactor and is relatively unprotected. Experts have raised concern that fierce fighting in the area could damage the reactor further and cause radioactive material to escape. Ukrainian authorities say the ongoing war is also hindering attempts to monitor radiation levels at Chernobyl. “There is no data on the current state of radiation pollution of the exclusion zone’s environment, which makes it impossible to adequately respond to threats,” said Energoatom, Ukraine’s state-run nuclear company. “Radiation levels in the exclusion zone and beyond, including not only Ukraine, but also other countries, could significantly worsen.” In 2020, a forest fire near the reactor caused radiation levels to spike to 16 times above normal. The conflagration was extinguished after a two-week effort by firefighters, with a man arrested for allegedly starting the fire “for fun”. Climate scientists have pointed out that such potential disasters are partially a symptom of global heating, with rising temperatures causing forests to dry out and become more suitable fuel for fire. In Europe, places from Sweden to the Mediterranean have experienced record fire outbreaks in recent years. LeRoy Westerling, an expert in wildfires at the University of California, said warmer temperatures are causing bigger fire seasons around the world, although the situation in Ukraine is complicated “in the context of a war where there are a lot of unusual ignition sources”. “Burning around Chernobyl is a concern because the burning may mobilize radioactive particles that were deposited decades ago when the reactors melted down,” he added. In the Chernobyl region itself, the die-off of surrounding trees due to the nuclear disaster has left a large amount of dead, fire-prone wood that is susceptible to large blazes. In 2015, an international team of scientists warned that “an expanding flammable area associated with climate change will lead to a high risk of radioactive contamination with characteristic fire peaks in the future.” The study added that firefighting infrastructure in the area was understaffed and underfunded, even before the Russian invasion. Separate research published last year confirmed that smoke from forest fires can carry radioactive material, and that the escalating climate crisis risks “nuclear wildfires [that] present a pressing yet little discussed problem”. Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University, said the fires in Ukraine fitted with that pattern of climate change-fueled wildfire that has repeatedly scorched places such as the US and Australia. Mann said the war and the climate crisis share a broader cause, namely “our continued dependence on fossil fuels”. “Fossil fuels are what prop up authoritarian petrostates like Russia who have used the tremendous wealth they have derived from the mining and selling of fossil fuels to the rest of the world to build their military,” he said.",News/World news,Forest fires erupt around Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/chernobyl-forest-fires-ukraine-nuclear-plant
3/23/2022,"Billions of pounds linked to the Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov and his business empire appear to have been held in secret Swiss accounts belonging to his family, an analysis of leaked documents suggests. Usmanov’s 56-year-old sister, Saodat Narzieva, appears to have been the one-time beneficial owner of at least 27 secret corporate accounts at Credit Suisse, including one that held nearly 1.9bn Swiss francs (CHF) (£1.6bn). Usmanov is subject to EU sanctions. Narzieva is a gynaecologist and obstetrician in a maternity hospital in Uzbekistan’s capital, Tashkent. Her name is attached to Credit Suisse accounts that appear in the Suisse secrets project, a leak of data relating to 30,000 clients of the Swiss bank. It is not clear why her name would be linked to accounts associated with her brother’s business empire. A spokesperson for Usmanov suggested the Credit Suisse data was “fake and incorrect” and there was nothing untoward about his financial relations with his sister, which were lawful and indicative of his “generosity”. Information from numerous financial leaks, including Suisse secrets, the Panama papers and FinCEN Files, has allowed reporters at the Guardian to highlight the vast wealth linked to Usmanov. The disclosures highlight the potential challenges western governments face when sanctioning or freezing the assets of oligarchs. The Russian Asset Tracker project has included relatives and associates, because in some cases their wealth derives almost entirely from the person under sanctions. Including family gives a more complete picture of the scale of their fortunes and, in some cases, they may have been used to hide or disperse assets. Last month, the US Treasury highlighted the problems of ownership by stating: “Sanctioned oligarchs and powerful Russian elites have used family members to move assets and to conceal their immense wealth.” Usmanov was worth an estimated $18.4bn (£14bn) in 2021 when he was listed as one of the world’s 100 wealthiest people by Forbes magazine. When the Guardian first asked Usmanov about links between the Credit Suisse accounts showing his sister as a beneficiary and his business group on 15 February, before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he instructed the London law firm Schillings to respond on his behalf. At the time, they said “true or false, information about a person’s finances is private. We can see no reason at all for our client to discuss financial dealings with journalists.” Schillings did not respond when asked whether the firm still represented the oligarch. The spokesperson for Usmanov has since stated that Narzieva did not have “possession or control of any accounts in Swiss banks on behalf of her brother”. “Any financial relations of Mr Usmanov with his sister would have been [the] result of his well-known generosity and support that he has always lawfully lent to his relatives,” they said. His spokesperson added that “all of Mr Usmanov’s businesses have been audited by Big 4 [audit] companies, since their inception, as well as were his personal tax returns and expenses. All of his investments, his expenses and his income have gone through strict compliance procedures.” Usmanov, an Uzbek-born businessman, has been subject to an asset freeze and EU travel ban since late February, after the bloc identified him as “one of Vladimir Putin’s favourite oligarchs” who it is claimed has paid millions to one of Putin’s influential advisers and been “entrusted with servicing financial flows”. Usmanov accused the EU of “false and defamatory allegations” that were “damaging his honour, dignity and business reputation”. Sanctions have also been imposed on him in the US and UK, where he once held a 30% stake in Arsenal football club. Switzerland has followed suit, ditching political neutrality to match the EU’s efforts. While western governments have introduced sanctions against the relatives of some Russian oligarchs, none of Usmanov’s family members have been included on any lists so far. According to documents in the Suisse secrets data, the 27 accounts at Credit Suisse that listed Narzieva as the beneficial owner were opened between 2004 and 2014, and 16 listed Usmanov’s metals, mining and telecoms holding company, USM, as a contact. The largest of the accounts held nearly 1.9bn CHF in 2011, while two others held up to 1.3bn CHF and 460m CHF in 2014. While a handful of the accounts were closed by 2016, about 18 are believed to have still been active in recent years. All of the assets were held in business accounts, some of which are believed to be linked to offshore companies. Credit Suisse said it was unable to comment on the accounts because of Swiss banking secrecy laws, and said it applies all sanctions “as a matter of principle and policy.” ""The information presented by the OCCRP Media Consortium is not new. As a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships but would note that names being focused on were already referenced in previous requests by the OCCRP. As a matter of principle and policy the bank applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland. As stated last month, approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts based on these requests are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries. We continue to strongly reject the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. Such allegations are without factual basis and represent a continued concerted effort to discredit the bank and the Swiss financial marketplace, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. As we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.” Narzieva’s brother made his fortune producing plastic bags, which were a rare commodity in the former Soviet Union, and later went on to manage the investment holdings arm of Russia’s state-owned gas company Gazprom from 2000 to 2014. He built stakes in a range of metals, mining, telecom and media firms through USM, which owns Russia’s second-largest mobile phone operator, MegaFon, as well as a 49% stake Metalloinvest, the metals and mining company Usmanov founded in 1999. A leaked email from the Panama papers lists Narzieva as one of several close relatives for whom offshore companies were being set up in 2013, in order to hold shares in another of Usmanov’s holding companies, ABU. The email, sent by the now-defunct Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, suggested that each of the so-called special purpose vehicles would hold bank accounts with Credit Suisse and another Swiss bank, Julius Baer. According to documents reviewed by the Guardian, one American bank raised suspicions about $1.6m-worth of transfers made between accounts linked to Usmanov and his associates between 2003 and 2015, including through one of the Credit Suisse accounts that named Narzieva as a beneficial owner. The bank reported that there were suspicions on the grounds that the company at the centre of the report – Usmanov’s Cyprus-based Gallagher Holdings – appeared to be a shell company that conducted “a significant amount of wires with numerous other shell entities”. The suspicious activity report (SAR) – filed in 2016 and later obtained by BuzzFeed and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists – said the bank could not determine the purpose of some of the transactions. The SAR added that it was concerned that “Gallagher appears to be owned by individuals with connections to Putin.” Banks and other financial institutions file SARs with law enforcement bodies when they suspect a client may be using their services for potential criminal activity. However, SARs do not mean a client is guilty of wrongdoing or require a bank to cease doing business with the client. A separate SAR filed in 2017 suggested Usmanov was the original source of more than $2.5m that Narzieva used to send money to a steel company boss in the Middle East in 2013. According to the SAR, Narzieva appears to have forwarded the money to the Middle Eastern businessman shortly after Usmanov wired his sister a “gift” of $3m. She later sent at least $50,000 back to Usmanov – which was related to “current expenses”, according to the payment reference. That businessman was the boss of a joint venture established by Usmanov’s Metalloinvest in 2010. The bank said in the SAR that it could not establish the purpose of the wire transfer between Narzieva and the Middle Eastern businessman since they “appear to be engaged in different lines of business as a doctor and managing director of a steel company, respectively”. The spokesperson for Usmanov and Narzieva did not explain the purpose of the transfer but said the Middle Eastern businessman was her son-in-law. Usmanov’s spokesperson said: “The entirety of Mr Usmanov’s capital was built through successful, sometimes risky, investments, as well as through the effective management of his assets, which is the essence of business.”The representative also stressed that, unlike some other wealthy Russian businessmen, Usmanov did not gain his fortune by acquiring newly-privatised Russian assets following the end of the Soviet Union They added: “Mr Usmanov has never acquired anything nor has he benefited from the Russian government, or that of any other state.”",News/World news,Oligarch linked to billions in 27 Swiss bank accounts in sister’s name ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/oligarch-alisher-usmanov-swiss-bank-arsenal
