5/17/2022,"Tom Harrison, the CEO of the England and Wales Cricket Board, is poised to step down from the role with Clare Connor, the former England captain and current managing director of women’s cricket and president of the MCC, lined up as interim replacement as a whirlwind few months of change at the top of English cricket continue. Already this year the England men’s team have removed or replaced their director of cricket, head coach, assistant coach and captain, while the ECB are yet to find a permanent replacement for their chairman, Ian Watmore, who stood down last October after just over a year in the post. Watmore’s interim replacement, Barry O’Brien, himself resigned last month because of ill health. “When times are really difficult you need people to step into that challenge and I am here to do that. I have never been more determined to do that. I am not running away from the challenge,” Harrison said in February. “It has been exceptionally difficult but I am not running away because it needs leadership and some consistency in terms of how we build back to a place where the game can recover from an extremely difficult period both on and off the pitch.” Harrison has been an often controversial figure since his appointment in 2014, most notably driving through the introduction of the Hundred, a new limited-overs competition that was played for the first time in 2021. Ostensibly because of that competition’s commercial success he and a group of senior executives are in line to share a £2.1m bonus pot, despite cutting 20% of the organisation’s workforce during the pandemic, while last November his performance in front of a digital, culture, media and sport select committee investigating the game’s response to Azeem Rafiq’s allegations of racism at Yorkshire was sufficiently concerning for county executives to discuss calling for his removal.",Sport/Sport,Tom Harrison steps down as ECB chief executive,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/17/tom-harrison-steps-down-as-ecb-chief-executive-cricket-england
5/17/2022,"Soaring food inflation could force schools to choose between offering smaller portions at lunchtime and using cheaper ingredients, according to the boss of one of the UK’s largest food wholesalers. Andrew Selley, the chief executive of Bidfood, a food distribution business with an annual turnover of nearly £2bn, said schools would be facing tough decisions unless the government increased funding for free school meals. Selley said shortages caused by the war in Ukraine had led to a doubling in the price of sunflower oil compared with a year ago, with knock-on effects on other vegetable oils. Baked goods are 20% to 30% dearer, and the increase in wheat prices will also feed through into pasta, egg and chicken prices, as wheat is used as chicken feed, he said. Selley said the amount of money provided by the government for free school meals had only gone up by 1.7% over the past 10 years, which was well behind food inflation even before the sharp spikes seen in recent months. “This is going to lead to some difficult decisions for school caterers: either they are going to serve smaller portions or use cheaper ingredients, which isn’t going to be good for the children,” Selley told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. He also called on the government to extend free school meals at primary schools, aimed at children from low-income families, to secondary schools. “Free school meals are vital for children’s education, attainment and longer-term contribution to society. They need to be ensuring that the funding for free school meals keeps pace with inflation, which it hasn’t done for the last 10 years, and as per the national food strategy recommendation, extend that through to secondary school as well as just primary.” Selley’s comments came a day after the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, blamed the war in Ukraine for the highest inflation in the UK for three decades, and warned that “apocalyptic” food prices caused by Russia’s invasion could have a disastrous impact on the world’s poor. “With due respect to the governor, he’s a little late to the party; we’ve been experiencing and talking about the dangers of food inflation for the last nine months,” Selley said, while admitting that the central bank’s powers were limited on this issue. “I’m not sure what the Bank could have done per se, the causes of food inflation are global in nature. They are not driven by excessive demand in the UK specifically. It’s largely around fuel energy prices, shipping, packaging, fertiliser prices, all of the inputs into the food chain have been increasing in the last nine months. The rise in interest rates isn’t that helpful. It’s not a demand-driven issue from the UK.”",News/Business,"Inflation could force schools to cut meal portions or quality, says food firm boss",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/17/inflation-uk-schools-meal-food-bidfood
5/17/2022,"Gillian McAllisterMichael Joseph, £14.99, pp416 It’s 30 October and Jen is waiting for her 18-year-old son, Todd, to come home. It’s 1am, and he’s late, but she isn’t too worried – at least, no more than any mother would be. Watching from the window, she notices him and smiles – then sees the man following him. Rushing on to the street with her husband, Kelly, she watches as Todd stabs the man three times. Jen wakes up the next morning, after a night at the police station, ready to fight, to hire lawyers, to try to understand how she had “come to raise a murderer. Teenage rage. Knife crime. Gangs. Antifa. Which is it? Which hand have they been dealt?” She is, she thinks, “an excellent rescuer, has spent all of her life doing just that, and now it’s time to help her son”. But, as she slowly comes to realise, the impossible has happened. It is 28 October and Todd has yet to kill anyone. Wrong Place, Wrong Time follows Jen, a divorce lawyer, as she moves back slowly, and then faster, through time, investigating what might have led Todd to commit murder, and trying to prevent it. She finds a knife in his bag – and takes it out. Will that be enough to send her back to her own timeline? “She has the knife. Perhaps it has been stopped. Whatever it is. Perhaps she will wake and it will be tomorrow. The day after. Anything but today again.” But she wakes and it is two days earlier. She digs into the life of Todd’s mysterious new girlfriend Clio, and investigates who the murdered man is – or was. In doing so, she discovers uncomfortable truths about her own relationship with her son; the times she wasn’t there for him because of work, the times she didn’t listen. Can she correct these mistakes? And how can she halt her tumble through time? McAllister handles her Liverpool-set twist on Russian Doll and Groundhog Day with great skill. There are delightful moments as when Jen tries desperately to convince her husband of what’s going on. He’s sceptical – until she takes him to the site of a car crash she couldn’t possibly know about, and they watch as her prediction comes true. Or when she meets a physicist who specialises in time travel and – time after exhausting time – manages to get him onside. Jen is a convincing, appealing protagonist: harried and guilty, like all mothers, she is given the chance to experience her son’s life again. Can she make it better? Messing with time travel isn’t for the faint-hearted novelist, but McAllister pulls off this adventure with aplomb. Tightly plotted, moving backwards through missing babies and criminal gangs and a sinister antagonist to its extremely satisfying conclusion, it is also, in many ways, a moving love story. I’ve had Covid all week and still couldn’t put it down: don’t miss it.

5/17/2022,"It’s entirely possible that nothing in the upcoming conference finals will match the thrills of the second round of this postseason, which was filled with young, talented teams desperately fighting for their playoff lives. Indeed, Sunday provided us with not one but two Game 7s. It wouldn’t be surprising if both these series go the distance too. Here’s how things could shake out. Eastern Conference finals (Game 1: Boston Celtics @ Miami Heat. Tuesday, 8.30pm EST) What the Miami Heat need to do: Win the battle of the three-pointers. When the Celtics stumbled during their seven-game series against the Bucks, it was primarily because their shooters were struggling to hit from beyond the arc. The Miami defense is capable of clamping down around the rim, meaning Boston’s shooters will need to stay hot. After all, bad shooting begets bad shooting, and this is a young Boston team who have shown they can get rattled. What the Boston Celtics need to do: Take a page from Kendrick Lamar: Stay humble. As we saw in Game 5 against the Bucks – when Boston blew a double-digit fourth-quarter lead and an opportunity to put the series on ice early – the Celtics have had a season-long issue with snatching defeat from the jaws of victory by settling on lazy shots and concentrating on the clock, rather than their opponents, late in games. How much Boston have learned from that second round could determine whether they beat the Heat. Key player: Bam Adebayo, center, Miami Heat. After his star-making turn in the conference semifinals, it would be tempting to give this to Boston’s Jayson Tatum. But we’ll take this opportunity to praise the key cog of Miami’s punishing defense. When Adebayo was left off the list of finalists for Defensive Player of the Year, an award that eventually went to Boston point guard Marcus Smart, he replied, “I can do anything those other guys can do.” Here’s the ideal chance for the big man to prove it against a Celtics offense that ruthlessly adapts to its opponents’ schemes. Prediction: Celtics-Bucks felt like it showcased the two best teams in the Eastern Conference and that the winner would go on to make the NBA finals. The Celtics not only won the series, they arguably outplayed Milwaukee in two of their three losses. In the post-New Big Three Era, the Celtics have made a habit of reaching the conference finals only to fall short of the promised land – twice at the hands of the Heat. That streak ends here if they keep their composure. Boston in 6. Western Conference finals (Game 1: Dallas Mavericks @ Golden State Warriors. Wednesday, 9pm EST) What the Golden State Warriors need to do: Solve the Luka Doncic problem. Doncic averaged 31.5 points against Golden State during the regular season. What does head coach Steve Kerr do: double-team Doncic or have defenders overhelp? Does he concede that Doncic is going to fill out the stat sheet and work to limit his teammates’ production? There are no good answers here, just less-bad ones, and Kerr can’t afford to stick with the pre-arranged plan if it doesn’t end up working. What the Dallas Mavericks need to do: Study their Game 7 game tape, perhaps? The Mavericks were heavy underdogs against Phoenix and will probably be underdogs against a Golden State team who have a lengthy playoff resume, but they clearly are capable of downing even more-experienced teams. The Warriors will be favored but Dallas have plenty of momentum, nothing left to lose and (oh yeah) the best player on any of the four remaining teams. It also helps when the whole offense doesn’t revolve around Doncic: contributions from Spencer Dinwiddie and Jalen Brunson helped them shock the Suns. Key player: Luka Doncic, Guard-Forward, Dallas Mavericks. With Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic all out of the playoffs, Doncic now has a strong case for being the best individual left standing. In Game 7 against the Phoenix Suns, he picked up 35 points, 10 rebounds, four assists and two steals in just 30 minutes of game-time to help lead the Mavs to a full-on onslaught against a Suns team that advanced to the NBA finals last year. Prediction: Golden State in 7. The cruel thing about the Phoenix Suns dropping the ball in Game 7 is that they probably would have been favored for a second straight finals appearance if they had won one more game. Maybe Chris Paul truly is doomed to never win a ring. While the Warriors had to regroup after their loss in the 2019 finals after Kevin Durant’s abrupt abdication and Klay Thompson’s devastating injuries, they are the best team still alive in the playoffs. In a postseason dominated by younger players, the reunited Splash Brothers have rediscovered their shooting strokes and that should give them the edge.",Sport/Sport,NBA conference finals predictions: elder statesmen Warriors primed for title charge,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/17/nba-conference-finals-predictions-elder-statesmen-warriors-primed-for-title-charge
5/17/2022,"After retirement, some footballers eye up a job in coaching or management; others may go on to become pundits. Not Iceland’s former goalkeeper Hannes Þór Halldórsson, who turns film-maker with this goofy cop comedy. The movie is Reykjavík’s answer to Hot Fuzz: it’s an affectionate sendup of Hollywood action flicks, with a gay twist. It’s reasonably funny but, like a lot of genre spoofs, it begins to look increasingly like a low-rent version of the original movies it’s parodying. Though there are bound to be more laughs for audiences in Iceland where the actors are all big-name celebrities. What Cop Secret does have going for it is a memorable lead, detective Bússi (comedian and TV personality Auðunn Blöndal). Bússi is Iceland’s most famous cop, a neanderthal knucklehead drunk who cruises Reykjavík in aviators and a leather jacket bashing bad guys. He’s dumped by his cardigan-wearing partner Klemenz (Sverrir Þór Sverrisson) after a high-speed car chase with Klemnz’s toddler strapped into the backseat (there’s a funny running gag here that sleepy Reykjavík is not exactly a crime capital). The reason for Bússi’s aggressively macho behaviour soon becomes apparent: he’s gay and terrified to come out. After a handful of perplexing bank robberies in which nothing is stolen, Bússi is forced to partner with his workplace nemesis Hörđur (actor-DJ Egill Einarsson). Hörđur is everything Bússi isn’t: a ripped former male supermodel fluent in 15 languages. (Einarsson’s real-life Instagram handle, DJ Muscleboy, gives you an indication of how well cast he is for the role). Hörđur is also proudly bisexual, and their bromance turns to actual romance as the pair bring down evil genius Rikki Ferrari (Björn Hlynur Haraldsson) – a poundshop Bond villain who insists on speaking in English with a creepy Donald Trumpish accent. Like the movie, he’s funny until the point he begins to grate.  Cop Secret is released on 23 May on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,Cop Secret review – Reykjavík’s answer to Hot Fuzz in action flick sendup,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/17/cop-secret-review-iceland-cop-comedy-gay-twist
5/17/2022,"Shortly after the draft supreme court opinion overturning Roe v Wade was leaked to the public, California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, condemned conservative attacks on abortion rights and pledged that his state would be a “sanctuary” for those seeking to end a pregnancy. But Newsom also directed some of his most pointed remarks toward fellow Democrats. “Where the hell is my party? Where’s the Democratic party?” Newsom said. “This is a concerted, coordinated effort, and yes, they’re winning. They are. They have been. Let’s acknowledge that. We need to stand up. Where’s the counter-offensive?” Even as Democrats have denounced the court’s provisional decision to overturn Roe and vowed to defend abortion rights, their efforts at the federal level have largely failed to live up to their rhetoric. A vote last Wednesday in the Senate to codify Roe and protect abortion rights nationwide was once again blocked, as Democrat Joe Manchin joined all 50 Republican senators in opposing the bill. The failure of Democrats in Washington to shore up abortion rights, even as they control the White House and both chambers of Congress, has complicated the party’s messaging to voters about the likely end of Roe. Some frustrated Democrats are instead turning their attention to state and local policies that could protect reproductive rights even if Roe falls. Abortion rights supporters’ frustration with Democratic inaction at the federal level has been on display since the draft opinion leaked earlier this month. At a protest outside the supreme court last week, abortion rights demonstrators chanted: “Do something, Democrats.” Progressive members of Congress have also argued for the urgent need to pass federal abortion rights legislation, calling on senators to amend the filibuster to get a bill approved. “People elected Democrats precisely so we could lead in perilous moments like these - to codify Roe, hold corruption accountable, [and] have a President who uses his legal authority to break through Congressional gridlock on items from student debt to climate,” progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on Twitter. The stakes of Democratic inaction are high, as abortion is certain or likely to be outlawed in 26 states if the court follows through with overturning Roe. Last weekend, the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, warned that Republicans may go even further if they regain control of the White House and Congress, floating the idea of a national abortion ban. Republicans would probably face widespread public outcry if they advanced a nationwide ban. A poll %09https:/www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_US_051122/"">released by Monmouth University last week found that just 9% of Americans support the idea of a national ban, while 64% support keeping abortion legal. However, abortion rights advocates warn that the threat of a nationwide ban will be real if Republicans take back Congress and the White House. “Republicans are definitely passing a national abortion ban once they have the power to do it,” said Shaunna Thomas, co-founder and executive director of the reproductive rights group UltraViolet. “They’ve been signaling they were going to pack the supreme court in order to overturn Roe. I don’t think people took them seriously enough. And so people really need to learn the lesson here and take them very, very seriously on this point.” Progressive groups like UltraViolet have called on Democrats to amend the Senate filibuster, which would allow a bill codifying Roe to get through the upper chamber with a simple majority of support. But Manchin and fellow Democrat Kyrsten Sinema have made it clear they will not support a filibuster carve-out, and the vote last Wednesday failed to even attract the 50 votes that would be necessary if the Senate rules were changed. “Our constitutional right to abortion has to be more important than their loyalty to arcane Senate procedures that are not even laws,” Thomas said. “People watched them carve the filibuster out to raise the debt ceiling. If they can do it for that, they should be able to do it for this.” Democratic congressional leaders have encouraged members of their party to direct their criticism toward Republicans rather than each other. In a “Dear colleague” letter to House Democrats last week, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, warned of Republicans’ wish for a national abortion ban and said their policies could even “criminalize contraceptive care, in vitro fertilization and post-miscarriage care”. “Make no mistake: once Republicans have dispensed with precedent and privacy in overturning Roe, they will take aim at additional basic human rights,” Pelosi said. Christina Reynolds, vice-president of communications at Emily’s List, which promotes pro-choice female candidates for office, insisted that voters who support abortion rights will know to hold Republicans accountable in the midterm elections this November. “Republicans have gotten us here in a large number of ways,” Reynolds said. But Democratic candidates running for office this fall will have to paint a longer-term picture of how the party plans to protect abortion rights, even if they cannot prevent the court from overturning Roe. “The Democratic party has to move away from this message about how we can fix everything right away,” said Kelly Dietrich, CEO of the National Democratic Training Committee. “This is a lifetime struggle. Government is hard. We will need you to vote this November, next November and every November after that because the people who want to take away your rights aren’t going to stop.” In the meantime, Democrats have an opportunity to turn their attention to the state and local offices that may be able to help protect abortion rights if Roe falls, Dietrich argued. “The fight for the next 10-plus years is going to be at the state and local levels,” he said. “It’s going to be in the state legislatures. It’s going to be in the city councils and at all the different local government forums we have around the country that aren’t big and sexy.” Some of those efforts are already under way across the country. In Michigan, where a 1931 abortion ban is still on the books and could go back into effect if Roe is overturned, the Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, has filed a lawsuit to block implementation of the law. Several county prosecutors also signed on to a statement saying they would not pursue criminal charges in connection to the 1931 law. One of those prosecutors was Democrat Karen McDonald in Oakland county, the second-largest county in Michigan. She said that, despite her despair over the likely end of Roe, she was committed to finding ways to ensure her neighbors’ rights and healthcare access. “It is a sad, tragic moment,” McDonald said. “But I am not going to spend one minute of my energy letting that tear me away from what I think is absolutely critical right now, which is we all need to pay attention and support and fund and help elect [those candidates] who want to protect our right to choose.” Oakland county was once a Republican stronghold, but it has become increasingly Democratic in recent years. McDonald said she has heard from members of her community who previously supported Republicans and are now rethinking their politics in light of the supreme court’s expected decision. “I know a lot of women who voted for Trump and are now saying I will never, ever ever, vote for a pro-life candidate. They just didn’t think it would happen,” McDonald said. “So I think this is really turning politics on its head.” Thomas agreed that many Americans who support abortion rights seem to have been taken aback by the provisional decision to overturn Roe, even after Republicans obtained a 6-3 majority on the court. Conservatives have also been calling for the end of Roe for decades, and Trump promised to nominate anti-abortion justices to the supreme court. “I don’t think it’s surprising that people had to see it to believe it, despite having heard this, particularly from Black and brown women who have been bearing the brunt of these attacks at the state level for a long time,” Thomas said. “As an organizer, I will tell you, it’s never too late to join the fight. And the time is really now.”",News/US news,‘We need to stand up’: Democrats criticized for inaction on abortion,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/17/democrats-abortion-rights-roe-v-wade-filibuster-senate-congress
5/17/2022,"Soaring bonuses for City bankers and high signing-on fees for construction and IT professionals pushed Britons’ average annual pay up by 7% in March, but most workers suffered a fifth consecutive month of falling living standards. Without bonus payments, workers were paid an average 4.2% wage increase in the three months to March, well below the 7% inflation rate recorded in the same month, according to the Office for National Statistics. Analysts said the UK was suffering a chronic shortage of workers after about 500,000 quit the labour market during the Covid-19 pandemic and many continental European workers left Britain following Brexit. The unemployment rate fell to 3.7%, the lowest since 1974. Paul Dales, the chief City economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: “Anecdotal evidence suggests that businesses have been raising bonuses to maintain staff, so it is probably another sign of how the tight labour market is feeding into faster wage growth.” Illustrating the widening gap between the number of staff employers need and those seeking work or to move job, vacancies rose to a record of 1,295,000 in the three months between February and April – an increase of 33,700 from the previous quarter and a jump of almost 500,000 since March 2020. For the first time since records began, the number of people out of work was higher than the level of vacancies after a 0.3% percentage point fall in the unemployment rate to 3.7%. Tony Wilson, the head of the Institute for Employment Studies, said there was an urgent need for the government to support workers back into jobs. Darren Morgan, the director of economic statistics at the ONS, said there was a rise in the number of people leaving unemployment to take up jobs and many people who had quit the labour market had returned to seek work, but it fell short of the number of people employers needed. About 83,000 workers rejoined the jobs market in March, up from 10,000 in February and a consensus forecast by City economists of a meagre 5,000 increase. “Since the start of the pandemic, around half a million more people have completely disengaged from the labour market,” Morgan said. “However, job vacancies are still rising, reaching yet another record high. “Indeed, with the latest fall in unemployment, to its lowest rate since 1974, there were actually fewer unemployed people than job vacancies for the first time since records began. “Continued strong bonuses in some sectors such as construction and especially finance mean that total pay is continuing to grow faster than prices on average, but underlying regular earnings are now falling sharply in real terms.” Responding to to the latest figures, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said: “I understand that these are anxious times for people, but it’s reassuring that fewer people are out of work than was previously feared, and we are helping them to keep more of their hard-earned money through tax cuts, changes to universal credit and support with household bills worth £22bn this financial year.”",News/Business,UK pay hit by inflation but unemployment falls to 48-year low,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/17/uk-pay-inflation-unemployment-city-bonuses
