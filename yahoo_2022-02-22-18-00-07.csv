2/22/2022,"Monday’s episode of Secrets of Playboy explored the corporate rape culture at Playboy. Last week, the magazine founder Hugh Hefner’s ex-girlfriend recalled a time he allegedly sexually assaulted their dog. This week, two former employees claim they were raped because the magazine condoned misogyny and sexual harassment. PJ Masten was a corporate Bunny Mother from 1975 to 1982. She managed the day-to-day operations for the bunnies. She recalled a high ranking executive forcing himself upon her. “He started kissing me, and he started grabbing me, and I said, ‘Please,’” Masten recalled. “This was a big executive. I said, ‘Please don't do this.’ And he said, ‘Why do you think you came to work in corporate?’ He said, ‘You have to play the game if you want to do anything in corporate.’ I was not an active participant. He just did what he had to do and turned around... raped me and he walked out.” Masten claimed she was not the only person to fall victim to sexual assault by male executives at the company. Miki Garcia, who was the head of promotions for the company from 1973 to 1982, claims she was also the victim of the rape culture. Early in her career, the Playmate flew to an auto show to sign autographs. One of the sponsors raped twice her the evening before. “I didn't want to become a problem to Playboy” Garcia said. “I didn't want for them to perceive me as a whiner or a person that couldn't handle the job. And so the tough part of me kicked in. I knew this is the way it was going to go and that was it.” The incident only motivated Garcia to climb the corporate ladder. She said, “I was going to get into a position of power so that no woman had to put up with that kind of behavior from any man just because she had a rabbit head logo on her.” After Garcia rose to the position of director of promotions, she made sure her rapist would never work with Playboy again. “So, when my rapist ordered up a Playmate for a job, I simply instructed my secretary to tell him to never call again, never.” Garcia said. “He would never, never, ever get a model from Playboy... Never.” Secrets of Playboy airs Mondays at 9 p.m. on A&E. See why Kyle Rittenhouse plans to sue media companies, Whoopi Goldberg and others: On Tucker Carlson Tonight Monday, Kyle Rittenhouse, the Illinois teenager who was acquitted last year in the shooting deaths of two Kenosha, Wisconsin protesters, announced plans to sue quite a few people for negative coverage of him. Rittenhouse named The View co-host Whoopi Goldberg by name, but was otherwise vague about his potential targets.
“Right now we’re looking at quite a few,” Rittenhouse said. “Politicians, celebrities, athletes. Whoopie Goldberg’s on the list. She called me a murderer after I was acquitted by a jury of my peers. She went on to still say that. And there’s others.”
Rittenhouse has been accused of being a white supremacist, allegedly flashing a white power symbol while at a bar with members of the far-right Proud Boys. He said he also plans to go after anyone who put that label on him.
“We are gonna hold everybody who’s lied about me accountable,” Rittenhouse said. “Such as…everybody’s who’s lied, called me a white supremacist. They’re all gonna be held accountable and we’re gonna handle them in a courtroom.” Read more from Yahoo Entertainment: Shaun White explains why comedian made him change his iconic look Robert Pattinson was 'absolutely terrified' to release 'The Batman' Black teen from viral fight video says cops were treating the white teen 'like he was superior to me' Tell us what you think!

2/22/2022,"The Republican National Committee tried to honor its favorite presidents on President’s Day. It didn’t go well. The official GOP account tweeted a meme mocking President Joe Biden while celebrating Richard M. Nixon and Donald Trump, among others: It’s unclear why the RNC chose those specific presidents. It’s not simply a reverse-order list of the most recent Republicans in the Oval Office as it skips Gerald Ford and Herbert Hoover. It’s also not a list of the most popular GOP presidents as it omits Theodore Roosevelt, who consistently ranks near the top of most polls and surveys. Twitter users were quick to point out the flaws in the RNC’s meme effort: This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.",Politics/HuffPost,Republican Party's Weird Salute To GOP Presidents Quickly Flies Off The Rails,https://news.yahoo.com/republican-partys-weird-salute-gop-083552738.html
2/22/2022,"Finnish President Sauli Niinistö said Sunday that he's recently seen changes in Russian President Vladimir Putin's behavior, saying that he now sounds more ""decisive"" than in the past. Niinistö, who has been in close contact with Putin, recalled an exchange the two shared on the phone. During one of the regular calls, Niinistö said he pushed back against Putin by standing up for his country’s sovereignty. That is when Putin switched tones, he said, then began to “officially” read his list of demands. “That was a change in his behavior, and I want to guess, and from that I guess that he wants to be very decisive, wants to sound like one. It was a different kind of behavior,” he said during an interview on CNN’s ""State of the Union."" For decades, Finland has kept a delicate balance in its relationship with Russia, having been invaded by the Soviet Union in 1939. The country, which borders Russia, stayed scrupulously neutral throughout the Cold War, becoming neither part of the Warsaw Pact nor of NATO. That delicate balance, however, might be tipped if Russia were to invade Ukraine, which President Joe Biden and others throughout the West have painted as an imminent threat. While Niinistö emphasized his country wasn’t planning on a dramatic change in its relationship with Russia, he suggested Russia’s actions are making Finnish people rethink joining NATO. ""A lot depends, also, what actually happens in Ukraine and how Russia is going to behave after that,"" he said. ""If Russia sees a success story for them, that makes them more dangerous."" However, he emphasized that Finland doesn’t feel threatened by Russia as of now. “Finland is a stable democracy. We are a member of the European Union and part of the West,” he said. “We are not afraid of Russian tanks suddenly crossing the Finnish border.”
