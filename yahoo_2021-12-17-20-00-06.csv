12/17/2021,"Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell described the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 as “horrendous” Thursday, and said he was looking forward to what the House select committee investigating it discovers. “I think the fact finding is interesting. We’re all going to be watching it,” McConnell told Spectrum News. “It was a horrendous event, and I think what they’re seeking to find out is something the public needs to know.” McConnell also refused to say anything negative about Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who is one of only two Republicans serving on the nine-member select committee. Earlier this week, thousands of pages of emails and text messages were turned over to the committee by former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows before he stopped cooperating with investigators. The communications revealed, among other things, the existence of a PowerPoint “coup plot” by Trump allies. Under the plan, Trump was to declare a national emergency, citing foreign control of electronic voting systems, in order to delay certification of the 2020 election results. The committee subpoenaed one of the authors of the scheme, retired Army Col. Phil Waldron, on Thursday. Other communications provided by Meadows revealed that certain Republican lawmakers supported the effort to interfere in the certification of the Electoral College count. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) admitted on Wednesday that he had forwarded a message to Meadows that claimed then-Vice President Mike Pence had the power to unilaterally subvert Americans’ selection of Joe Biden for president. On Tuesday, McConnell told CNN that he’s been keeping an eye on the committee’s probe. “We’re all watching, as you are, what is unfolding on the House side,” McConnell said. “It will be interesting to reveal all the participants who were involved.” “It will be interesting to reveal all the participants who were involved.”pic.twitter.com/8evmiqVwGJ — Robert Costa (@costareports) December 14, 2021 McConnell, who has a tense relationship with Trump, blasted the former president in January for “provoking” his supporters’ storming of the Capitol. “The mob was fed lies,” McConnell said on the Senate floor two weeks after the insurrection. “They were provoked by the president and other powerful people, and they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like.” Yet, McConnell also turned Republicans against creating a bipartisan investigation into the events surrounding the insurrection. “I do not believe the additional, extraneous commission that Democratic leaders want would uncover crucial new facts or promote healing,” he said at the time.

12/17/2021,"They say a dog is man’s best friend. Sirga the lioness might disagree. A compilation video of the massive creature leaping up and hugging her caretaker Valentin Gruener has gone viral on TikTok, amassing almost 195,000 likes on the short-form video app. Gruener, the co-founder of the Modisa Wildlife Project in central Botswana, found Sirga when she was just a few days old, he told NBC News on Thursday via a video messaging app. Sirga’s parents had been captured because they were preying on livestock, and their cubs were born in the rehabilitation camp where they were being kept. With their mother unable to move her cubs away from the pride as she would in nature, Sirga’s siblings appeared to have been killed in the camp by other lions, Gruener said. Sirga survived, he said, but her mother refused to feed her. He added that he named Sirga, who turns 10 next year, after the star of “L’enfant lion,” a 1993 film from France and Burkina Faso. She lives in a fenced reserve of her own, adjacent to his home, he said. “Sirga is amazingly gentle for a very large cat. When I go to see her, she always hugs me like in that video,” he said. “I think overall she’s got a very friendly and gentle personality for a lion.” After the video was posted to TikTok, the reaction from users was largely positive. “I want a lion so bad,” one, @dylanglover_, wrote. “I am so envious. Thank you for all the glimpses of what it would be like to work on a reserve,” another, @livingthequeenlife, said. Gruener said Sirga’s social media popularity had helped him to shed light on his work and wildlife conservation as a whole. “We do a lot of Q and A videos and let people comment, to answer questions they might have about this life,” he said. “Sirga, in some ways, is a bit of an ambassador for nature, conservation, or the wild lions that are really out there.” Despite their strength, lions are not dangerous if one knows how to behave around them, he said. “A lion is not like a machine that wants to kill anyone,” he said. “They’re quite predictable and actually fairly harmless to us.”",U.S./NBC News,"He rescued her as a cub, Sirga the lioness repays him with hugs",https://news.yahoo.com/lioness-becomes-unlikely-tiktok-star-144312126.html
