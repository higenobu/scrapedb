5/1/2022,"John Coates, the vice-president of the International Olympic Committee and outgoing president of the Australian National Olympic Committee, said “to a large extent” that Sydney was awarded the summer Olympic Games in 2000 because it “bought the Games”. In extracts from a recently discovered hour-long interview in 2008, Coates revealed that he offered payments to two African National Olympic Committees who were represented on the IOC panel in exchange for their votes in 1993. Coates, who is also the president of the court of arbitration for sport, was cleared of any wrongdoing in 1999 in respect to this by an independent report by the auditor Tom Sheridan after it was alleged that this amounted to him offering bribes in exchange for votes. Sheridan said the payments were not offered directly to the IOC members and also criticised the IOC guidelines for bidding cities as unworkable. He later admitted promising an extra $35,000 to both the NOCs represented by Kenya’s IOC member Charles Mukora and Uganda’s IOC member Francis Nyangweso at a dinner on the last night before the IOC vote in Monte Carlo. “I wasn’t going to die wondering why we didn’t win,” said Coates in 1999, adding that there had been nothing “sinister” about the arrangement. “There were no payments made, letters were handed over with commitments to two African NOCs,” he added in 2004 after an investigation by the BBC Panorama programme. Coates, the leading Australian official in the Olympic movement, was vice-president of the Sydney bid committee. It is understood that Coates does not dispute that, on behalf of the Australian Organising Committee at the time, he offered contingent grants and sports assistance to the NOCs of Kenya and Uganda under the AOC’s programme of assistance to African NOCs. Such grants were not in breach of any IOC candidature rules at the time. They were subsequently banned by the IOC in the wake of a corruption scandal surrounding Salt Lake City’s successful bid to host the 2002 Winter Olympics. Coates detailed his agreement with Mukora and Nyangweso in 1993 in an hour-long interview ranging over his career with Victoria University sports lecturer Bob Stewart in 2008, as part of a Sports Oral History for the National Library of Australia. Nyangweso was cleared of any wrongdoing by an investigation in 1999, while Mukora resigned from the IOC in 1999 after the Sheridan report recommended he should be expelled. Mukora was also accused of receiving payments to his personal bank account from the Salt Lake bid team. Coates explained the offer to Mukora and Nyangweso, made by him as the president of the Australian Olympic Committee. “Clearly the Ugandan and Kenyan members I think were very nervous about having to deal with me because I sat at their table at a big banquet the night before,” he remembered. “So I just went over and said to them, ‘Look if, you know, if you vote for us and we get up, then there’s $50,000 US [a different figure to the $35,000 that has been reported] for each of your two National Olympic Committees, 10 a year for the next five years or whatever, you tell them it’s to be spent on sporting purposes. “That subsequently, and it was quite open about it, it was all audited. But subsequently one of those members was seen to have directed the 10 into his own bank account and there was an inquiry into all of that and so it’s suggested we bought the Games. Well to a large extent we did …” Coates also said that he arranged for athletes and coaches from African countries to be provided with scholarships to train at the renowned Australian Institute of Sport in Adelaide in the lead up to the Sydney Games at a cost that was later revealed to have reached $2m, a scheme he admitted was “very important” in securing the Games. “Wherever we would go the Chinese had put a hospital in … we were driving into Mali and they’d just say: ‘Oh, that’s the bridge that the Chinese have just built’. And they were doing the same in the Pacific,” recalled Coates. “Obviously our government doesn’t spend money like that … And so we went away with a package of scholarships to the AIS and we were offering for two athletes and a coach to come. The idea was that the coach would learn something and go back and be able to pass that on to a wider group of people. We got there and we saw what was happening in the real world. “So I took the decision to make it – ‘well there’s one scholarship we’re giving out but if we win you get it every year for seven years and we’ll run a camp in Australia for all your teams before they come here’. And we did that – we spent a fair bit of money.” A spokesperson for the IOC told the Guardian that none of its regulations at the time had been broken. “At the time of the Sydney 2000 candidature, financial support from an NOC standing as a candidate to an NOC for sports development was not included in the rules in force at that time. When this situation became public, it was stated that the then rules had not been breached. However, immediately afterwards the rules of conduct for the following candidature process were amended in 2003.” Lawyers acting for Coates said he had a long and distinguished reputation in the Olympic movement and the world of sport and expressed concern that the extracts had been taken out of context. They added: “We are instructed that the IOC publicly confirmed that Mr Coates had not breached its rules at the time.” Ian Chesterman, the chef de mission of the Australia team at the Tokyo Olympics, is succeeding Coates as AOC president after being elected by AOC delegates on Saturday.",Sport/Sport,"Sydney Olympics were bought ‘to a large extent’, said Australian official John Coates",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/01/sydney-olympics-were-bought-to-a-large-extent-said-australian-official-john-coates
5/1/2022,"The platinum jubilee children’s book due to go out to every state primary school pupil to celebrate the Queen this month will not be welcomed in all Welsh or Scottish schools. On the request of the Scottish and Welsh governments, schools in those regions will be asked instead to opt-in to receive copies. The book was originally intended to be in schools within the next few weeks, ahead of the jubilee weekend next month, and was to have been available in the major regional languages, including Gaelic and Welsh. New details and images of the book released on Sunday reveal the narrative will focus on the adventures of a little girl called Isabella, who visits her great grandmother and finds out about many of the highlights of Queen Elizabeth II’s 70-year reign. Put together in collaboration with royal experts and historians, the book includes famous quotes from the Queen, facts on the coronation ceremony, and anecdotes about the lives of famous Commonwealth figures, such as Nelson Mandela. It also contains information about notable kings and queens and a timeline of Queen Elizabeth’s own life. The UK government reportedly awarded a £12m contract to London-based publisher DK books to produce 211,000 bilingual copies of the book to be distributed to children at just under 3,000 schools and educational establishments in Wales. But after seeing early pages, members of the Welsh government felt it would not be appropriate to distribute it to every pupil. Instead they asked in March to leave it to schools to request their copies. It has been described as having taken an Anglocentric line that did not give due regard to the history of the devolved regions of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Government ministers were said to be dismayed at the Welsh government’s initial reaction to their plans, especially as the book covers how the four nations came together as one United Kingdom, including some pages on Owain Glyndwr’s Welsh rebellion against the English in 1400 to take the title of ‘Prince of Wales’. The book tracks British history through the memories of great granny Joyce. When Isabella arrives at Joyce’s house, she discovers a treasure box of souvenirs that become her guide to the history of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth. The keepsakes in the box prompt descriptions of the lives of inspirational people, important art, design, and cultural achievements, and landmark innovations and inventions. These include construction of the Channel tunnel, the election of Margaret Thatcher – the first female prime minister – and the creation of the world wide web. Education secretary Nadhim Zahawi said: “Queen Elizabeth II is the first British monarch to celebrate a platinum jubilee, and Her Majesty’s dignity, commitment and grace continues to inspire people all over the world. “I hope all our pupils are as excited as I am to read about Her Majesty’s amazing life and the people and events that have shaped history during the last 70 years.” The book will also be on private sale from 23 June.",Arts/Books,Children’s book on the Queen’s jubilee given cold shoulder by schools in Wales and Scotland,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/01/childrens-book-on-the-queens-jubilee-given-cold-shoulder-by-schools-in-wales-and-scotland
5/1/2022,"Mikhail Baryshnikov once told me that when he was making Rhapsody with Frederick Ashton, the choreographer used to walk into rehearsals with the Rachmaninov score turned down to mark how far they had got. In her programme essay, Jann Parry notes that he wandered into the creation of Scènes de Ballet with a book of advanced geometry under his arm, transforming theorems into floor patterns. Presumably, he arrived to make A Month in the Country, based on Turgenev, with a dog-eared copy of the play. Extreme musicality, a refined sense of balletic symmetry and an understanding of narrative are all qualities that define the Royal Ballet’s founding choreographer, and they were all on display in this outstanding triple bill. Scènes de Ballet, made in 1948, is in many ways Ashton’s most modernist ballet, its jagged angles and sharp juxtapositions perfectly matching the energy and shape of Stravinsky’s score. Like André Beaurepaire’s surrealist backcloth, it exudes a strange sense of otherness, of a story not quite told. The cast I saw was led by Vadim Muntagirov, finding height and finesse in jumps that rise from standing, but also channelling moments of still grace. As his ballerina, Sarah Lamb gleamed in lemon and black, her shoulders sloping in perfect epaulement. That placing of the head and arms, the contrapuntal flow of lyrical energy through the back, is one of the qualities that makes Ashton difficult for today’s dancers to perform. It is what defines the Royal Ballet’s style, yet it is quite different from the more straight-on movement of much modern choreography; one of the pleasures of this triple bill is watching the company find their way into its rigorous complexities. In the dramatic aspects of Ashton’s works, they are already comfortable. In A Month in the Country, each dancer recognises how the intricacies of the choreography represent the character of the people caught in this psychodrama. The bright runs and quick feet of the young ward Vera (sparkling Anna Rose O’Sullivan) reveal her hopes of love; Luca Acri’s acrobatics as Kolia show the buoyancy of boyhood, about to collide with the feelings of the adult world. Above all, the arched back and bending swoons of Marianela Nuñez’s impassioned Natalia communicate both her overdramatising of her boredom and then – devastatingly – the depth of her feeling for the young tutor Beliaev, whose arrival in her family’s midst destroys its delicate balance. Matthew Ball makes the character both innocent – his pleasure in flirting with Leticia Dias’s uncomplicated maid is infectious – and unusually sexy. He bends into Nuñez’s body as if he is folding himself into his future. It’s a marvellous story, beautifully told, with a Chopin score wonderfully played by the pianist Kate Shipway. Finally, the fun and dazzle of the abstract Rhapsody, from 1980, choreographed for the 80th birthday of the Queen Mother, and revived as the company’s nod to the Queen’s platinum jubilee. Marcelino Sambé looked initially nervous but soon shook it off to display with panache both his own charm and a series of gravity-defying revoltades; Francesca Hayward makes light and luscious work of skittering bourrées and embroidered arm movements.

5/1/2022,"It started with an extraordinary tale of wartime bravery and led to the publication of a bestselling account, The Man Who Broke Into Auschwitz, and to a BBC documentary. Then the difficult questions began. Were the heroic exploits of Denis Avey really all they seemed? Was his dramatic claim he had swapped places with a man inside a concentration camp possibly a fake? In spite of growing doubts, Avey’s story that he saved the life of a Jewish prisoner by placing himself in danger while he was being held in a prisoner-of-war sub-camp near Auschwitz is still in popular currency. But now a dogged historical researcher, working to document the history of the German POW camps and concentration camps in Poland, is demanding the return of the price he paid for his copy of Avey’s 2011 autobiography and suggesting that other readers do the same. The story laid out by Avey is full of holes, according to the British-Israeli researcher Alon Shapira, and therefore damaging to the integrity of Holocaust history. This weekend the Observer has learned that Hodder & Stoughton, publisher of The Man Who Broke Into Auschwitz, plans to include qualifying notes in any future edition of the influential book, which remains in print. The move would follow a decision recently taken by the Holocaust Education Trust to dissociate itself from the flawed historical narrative it contains of Avey’s incarceration as a POW in Poland. This is despite the fact the organisation originally put forward Avey’s name for the honour of being named a British Hero of the Holocaust. In a statement to the Observer this weekend, the trust said: “Upholding the truth and integrity of the Holocaust is vital, and when new information comes to light it must be taken seriously.” The Imperial War Museum, which first interviewed the late Avey about his wartime experiences, has also distanced itself from the story of this Englishman, who was certainly held nearby as a POW, and who then claimed to have briefly switched identities with a Jewish camp inmate in order to help him and to verify the horrors committed inside. The museum’s file containing Avey’s testimony has now been flagged with a public warning. “This story needs to be corrected as soon as possible by the publishers so that the real facts can be passed on to the next generation,” said Shapira. James Long, a British author who knew Avey before his death seven years ago and who helped research the original book, is now also keen for the next edition to contain a full acknowledgment of the questions and doubts since raised about Avey’s memories. “I would like to provide more of the background information and include some of the questions that have been raised since,” he said. But Shapira’s discoveries of a series of discrepancies in Avey’s story have now mounted up into a big potential problem for Hodder & Stoughton. While wartime memories are likely to become confused for any survivor, the accumulation of conflicting detail and changes to Avey’s recollections are now impossible to ignore. First, a similar account of a prisoner swap with a camp internee was originally printed in a book called The Password Is Courage, about the mysterious and not always trustworthy wartime character, Charles Coward. This narrative also uses the phrase “the man who broke into Auschwitz”. Avey’s defenders, among them Long, argue that Coward may actually have appropriated the story of Avey’s brave mission, rather than the other way around. Second, Avey initially told the Imperial War Museum that he had swapped with a Birkenau prisoner called Ernst. He later changed the location of the camp to a factory worker site and the identity of the Jewish camp survivor to a man called Hans, who has never been traced. It is possible, the publisher’s researchers have argued, that Avey innocently mixed up the location of the work camps next to his POW camp with the infamous death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau, which was several miles away. Among other conflicting assertions to have come to light, Avey also failed to mention that his father, who lived until 1960, was with him in his POW camp. In the book, Avey specifically said he had no knowledge of his father’s wartime experiences, as the two had never discussed them. “I don’t think he ever knew that I had been in a camp near Auschwitz,” Avey wrote. Now Shapira has produced a German POW record for Avey’s father, seen by the Observer, that shows he spent time in the same prison as his son, a facility known as E715. Those protective of Avey’s reputation point out they believe there were between 800 and 1,000 prisoners in E715 and that it might still have been possible for father and son to have been in different buildings. Shapira’s argument that a battered photograph of a POW football team clearly shows father and son standing next to each other during their imprisonment is not conclusive, they argue. The publisher’s new plan to consider adding amendments and contextual notes of queries and doubts to Avey’s account, which was written with journalist Rob Broomby, comes after an official response from Hodder & Stoughton last week that said it stood by Avey’s original account. “We have no reason to question the veracity of Denis Avey’s book, The Man Who Broke Into Auschwitz,” it reads. Referring to previous attempts to question the facts in the autobiography, the response continues: “Avey and his father were not in the same prison camp, E715, as the book makes completely clear,” and it concludes, “Denis Avey’s book is not in any way based on or derived from the Charles Coward book.”",News/World news,Hero or hoax?

5/1/2022,"One of the most compelling aspects of Malian superstar Oumou Sangaré’s music has been the interplay of her hard-hitting subjects – forced marriage, war – and her sinuous, easygoing tunes. Her authoritative voice is often offset by an all-female chorus, supplying the solidarity her songs invoke. But Sangaré’s range encompasses tenderness and suffering too, rarely more so than on this hugely accessible record that reaches across borders in subtle but inveigling ways. West Africa birthed the lope of the blues – see Sarama, a song discouraging jealousy – but there are resonances here, too, of many different folk-fingerpicking techniques, and lush effects applied to the guitars, koras and kamele ngoni. Timbuktu, Sangaré’s ninth outing, is named after the legendary city, one sacked by Islamist insurgents a decade ago, and stands in for the political problems ongoing across west Africa. And although this album was written at her new house in Baltimore, when Sangaré got stuck there during lockdown, many of these tracks look to her home region of Wassoulou, whose sung heritage and stringed instruments she has turned into an international world music phenomenon.

5/1/2022,"Of the hundreds of galleries in London, none has been given over exclusively to the growing and vibrant market for African photography. Until now, that is. Doyle Wham is the creation of two young Londoners who are eschewing Britain’s “elite” art scene to open what they say is the country’s first ever gallery dedicated exclusively to African photographers. “We were aware of so many amazing photographers who were Africa-based but who weren’t being exhibited or even noticed,” says Imme Dattenberg-Doyle, 27, a graduate of the Royal College of Art in London. She and her friend, Sofia Carreira-Wham, 28, a museums and heritage scholar, have opened Doyle Wham as a new permanent gallery in a converted warehouse in London’s Shoreditch. The founders started out offering pop-ups and one-off exhibitions of African photography – “not safari shots by random people, but African photographs by African people!” says Carreira-Wham. “It sounds niche, but, for us, it wasn’t really like that,” she says. “We’d been sending each other incredible African photographers back and forth for some time via social media, and we’d spent a lot of time going to exhibitions, but we didn’t see any of this exciting talent being shown.” That talent begins with South Africa’s Trevor Stuurman, the first big solo show at Doyle Wham. His bold, highly stylised images are of black men and women in poses that the artist says are about elevating and celebrating African people, and taking back the narrative so that Africans, like him, tell “the African story”, rather than having it imposed on them by others. Despite Stuurman’s immense success in his home country, with subjects including Barack Obama, Naomi Campbell and Beyoncé, the 29-year-old’s photography has never featured in a gallery in Britain. Speaking to the Observer from his home in Johannesburg, Stuurman says the gallery is a much-needed platform for African artists. “I feel like so much was stolen from Africa, and it’s about reclaiming that. That’s why I think photography is such a powerful medium – it allows us to retell the story and show what [the continent] looks like now – to cultivate a better understanding of what Africa is,” he says. Stuurman grew up in a small mining town five hours drive from Johannesburg, and started taking pictures when he was 14, not with a conventional camera but using a cheap mobile phone, he says. (Stuurman’s family had little money, and his father died when he was still at high school.) He took shots of his friends, imitating poses they’d seen in glossy magazines at the local grocery store. After leaving school, he took an SLR camera on to the streets of Cape Town and snapped pictures of everyday people. That brought him his big break, winning a competition with Elle magazine and a trip to London – his first time outside South Africa. At 19, he found himself on the front row of a Burberry show. It was surreal, he says. “These figures I’d seen in the magazines were literally right in front of me. It was a world I’d always looked at as a fantasy – and there I was, part of it.” A decade on, Stuurman has been credited with helping change the visual narrative of contemporary Africa (Beyoncé picked him to work on styling and costume design for her 2020 film Black Is King). “Being African is my superpower. I want to use it to capture African images that don’t exist on Google,” he says. This idea of casting new light on Africa, instead of focusing on the continent’s wildlife, poverty or charity, is also at the core of Doyle Wham, says Carreira-Wham. Later this year, they will exhibit work by the Gabonese photographer Yanis Davy Guibinga, Nigeria’s Morgan Otagburuagu and Angèle Etoundi Essamba from Cameroon – artists who each have incredible and authentic stories to tell through their work, she says, but who are so far unknown outside their own countries. Doyle Wham’s founders also hope to challenge snobbery and the perceived low value of African photography in Britain’s galleries and auction houses. “People (especially men) come up to us all the time and say things like, ‘but collectors don’t want aluminium frames’ – and ‘there’s no value in African photography’,” Dattenburg-Doyle says. “And we’re like, OK, we’ll figure that out for ourselves, thanks.” They are trying to brush aside this elitism, they say, and come up with their own ideas – like “snaps and schnapps nights” every Thursday. Not one for the purists, perhaps, but anything to get people – especially younger people – through the door of the gallery.

5/1/2022,"Disappearing into a book or a box set is a tempting pursuit when you need to create a virtual bubble round yourself. I’m currently halfway through the biggest book I’ve probably ever read, the Pulitzer Prize finalist Red Comet by Heather Clark, a biography of Sylvia Plath.

5/1/2022,"In the late 18th century, as the impact of the Industrial Revolution bit into the lives of the nascent working class, the high cost of fuel, one study notes, “forced inhabitants of many southern regions to abandon home cooking”. Fuel costs were much greater in the south than in the north. As a result, Frederic Morton Eden observed in The State of the Poor (1797), “the culinary preparations of the Northern peasant are so much diversified, and his table so often supplied with hot dishes”, whereas in the south, working-class families could not afford to boil or bake potatoes, so were forced to buy cheap white bread and eat dinner cold. Because it was more expensive to cook at home than to buy shop-made bread, there were more bakeries per head of population in poor areas such as Hampshire than in richer regions such as Yorkshire. More than 200 years on and we’re back in a Britain in which many poor families are being “forced to abandon home cooking” because of the high cost of fuel. Not only has there been an explosion in the use of food banks, but many food bank users “are declining products such as potatoes and other root veg because they can’t afford to boil them”. Much of the discussion of the cost of living crisis has rightly been about the impact of soaring prices on the lives ofmillions driven to desperation. It is not just inflated prices for basic goods that have created such desperation. It is also the precariousness of income and, in particular, the huge growth in recent years of poorly paid, insecure jobs. A study by Dalia Gebrial and Paddy Bettington, of the thinktanks Autonomy and the Centre for Labour and Social Studies, tracks what it calls the “Uberisation” of the labour market. “Insecurity,” it observes, has “become an endemic part of British working life” and “the proportion of the workforce employed precariously has ballooned”. The kind of insecurity once associated solely with the gig economy is now spreading through many sectors of employment: the health and care sectors, hospitality, cleaning, hair and beauty, even “previously protected middle-class jobs in academia”. Using markers such as unemployment, under-employment, temporary contracts, part-time work, variable weekly wages and zero-hours contracts to establish an “Insecurity Index”, the report suggests that “insecurity has increased by 50% since 2005”. Almost every occupational sector shows greater insecurity. After the 2008 financial crash, unemployment rose sharply, peaking at 8.5% in 2011 before falling to a 45-year low of 3.8% in 2019. The fall in unemployment has been hailed as a great economic success story. But unemployment has fallen largely because workers have been drawn into low-wage or part-time jobs or into self-employment. The price of low unemployment has been vastly increased job insecurity. London, often seen as wealthy, has been particularly badly hit by insecure work. So, unsurprisingly, have women, young people and ethnic minorities. The most high-profile and shocking expression of the insecurity of jobs was the recent sacking by P&O of almost 800 members of its shipping staff. There was widespread outrage, including from ministers, who have called on the chief executive, Peter Hebblethwaite, to step down and for the government to review all contracts with P&O. But it is government policies and laws that have made such mass sackings possible in the first place. The actions of P&O were particularly savage, but employers often make use of the policy of “fire and rehire”. A study last year showed that 10% of all workers have been told to reapply for their jobs on worse conditions or face the sack; for 18-24 year-olds that figure almost doubled.British Gas, British Airways, the bus company Go North West and many others have attempted in the past year to fire and rehire workers. Last October, the government blocked a private member’s bill to outlaw the practice. For four decades, successive governments have, in the name of creating a “flexible” labour market, made it easier for employers to sack workers and harder for unions to respond. The roots of the process go back to the 1980s and Margaret Thatcher’s assault on unions and postwar social model. This is not the first time that P&O has sacked workers en masse. In 1988, the company exploited Thatcher’s laws to sack 400 workers, impose pay cuts and longer hours and then used the 16-month dispute that followed to break the National Union of Seamen. When New Labour came to power in 1997, it introduced some important protective measures, such as the national minimum wage and tax credits, but maintained the Tory anti-union laws and reinforced the drive towards a more flexible labour market. By the early 2000s, there had been created what some analysts call an “hourglass” labour market, divided between badly paid “McJobs” at one end and generously rewarded “MacJobs” at the other, with “middling” jobs squeezed. As trade union membership fell from 13.2m in 1979 to a record low of 6.2m in 2016 (since when it has slightly recovered to 6.6m), those who most need union protection are least likely to be unionised. It is like a return to the labour relations of the early 20th century. The expansion of insecure, poorly paid jobs in a flexible labour market without the protection of trade unions has been a major driver of the cost of living crisis. There is a desperate need for an immediate response to soaring prices, from a proper increase in benefits and the minimum wage to holding down energy price increases. But equally important is challenging the policies that have created an insecure labour market under the guise of a flexible one: a need to roll back trade union restrictions and to remove employers’ rights to fire and rehire and to prevent unions from organising. Most of all, there is a need to ensure union protection of the lowest paid, least secure workers, expanding the work of unions such as the IWGB and the RMT. A 21st-century Britain in which there are echoes of late 18th-century fuel poverty and early 20th-century labour insecurity is not something we should tolerate.

5/1/2022,"Early in the summer of 2019, only weeks before a documentary about her was due to go live on the BBC, Kate Nash found herself in a state of total panic. Five years in the making, when the recording had originally kicked off for Kate Nash: Underestimate the Girl, its producers had planned to make a film capturing Nash’s life as she knew it then: a late 20-something singer – known to most for her chart-topping, era- defining 2007 debut album Made of Bricks – continuing to carve out a career for herself out of the spotlight as an independent recording artist. There’d be struggles, yes: going it alone in the industry is a relentless hustle. But nine months into filming, Nash’s world unravelled in ways she could never have predicted. Work was already stalling; music execs were uninterested in both her own punk-rock offerings and the more commercial pop lyrics she was attempting to sell. Then she discovered her money was gone; her manager had been misappropriating – or at least misspending – it. A lengthy legal battle ensued and Nash was forced to move back home to north London with her parents unable to make rent, flogging her belongings for survival. Although talk of her personal life and mental health went mostly unspoken in documentary’s final cut, it’s clear to see she was quite seriously struggling. “It was without doubt one of the lowest periods of my life,” Nash says today, over Zoom from the garden of her Los Angeles home. She is now 34, life is far more settled and there’s a calmness when she speaks of that time. “I was lost. So fucking lost. And I wasn’t fully conscious of things that were happening. When you’re that low, you can’t connect with a lot. I wasn’t even thinking about it as a documentary while it was being made. I felt like I was drowning. Trying to stay afloat consumed everything.” When it came to the film’s release, Nash was filled with fear. “I didn’t want people to know,” she explains, “to have to relive it. For a while, I believed that being stupid and naive was why I was taken advantage of. That I was an idiot. It’s common if you get screwed over. You feel shame and blame yourself.” But while what happened to Nash might have been particularly unjust (she and her ex-manager reached an out-of-court settlement), she sees it as part of a wider – and mostly unspoken – problem within the music business. Friends reassured her it’s a story worth telling; other artists, too. She found comfort in the idea it might encourage change in the industry she has spent her entire adulthood traversing. For all the trauma it contains, she now feels proud for weathering the storm and refusing to keep silent. “Anyone who hasn’t been through a difficult time in music, then brace yourself,” she says. “Everyone who enters the industry will be crushed in their own way: it’s unregulated; there are sharks; people are taken advantage of, and there’s nobody to go to when you get into trouble. We’re not unionised properly, so we’re unprotected.” Streaming services don’t pay artists enough for their recorded work, Nash believes. Labels treat their roster as expendable commodities. “Artists are told they can make their money touring,” she says, “but it’s not always true. I’m going on tour later this month and I’m going to lose money, because I’m paying everyone properly.” There’s no bitterness in the way she sets these issues out. But even in bringing it up, Nash feels conflicted. “I don’t always want to be mouthing off about the music industry,” she says, “I feel like I’m a go-to for that. But other people can’t complain, because they’ve been broken.” Buoyed up by the success of projects like Made of Bricks – and acting in three seasons of the Netflix women’s wrestling comedy-drama Glow – she can keep going. “I don’t want to be the only person who says the industry is shit,” Nash says. “I want to switch off and say actually I’m doing great; I’m happy. But it’s an injustice that people have been destroyed by. And because I haven’t, I will talk about it.” Nash was just 19 when she signed her first record deal, but only a few years earlier there was no indication she’d soon find teenage pop-stardom. She grew up in Harrow, northwest London. Her mum was a nurse and her dad worked in IT. She wrote songs in music classes, but was far more interested in shopping at River Island, the UK garage scene and going underage clubbing. “When I was 15, I heard about this girl in the year above me who’d got into a free musical theatre school,” Nash recalls. “I tracked her down, found out about the BRIT School, and told my parents I wanted to visit.” Nash was accepted on to its theatre course, and commuted every day down to Croydon. “I lapped everything up,” Nash says. “I was always the last person to leave and did every extracurricular.” With few opportunities presenting themselves after her final year, Nash took a job at Nando’s. “Then, at 18, I had major heart surgery,” Nash says. “It was this big realisation for me… I could be dead. I should probably do something.” While homebound after falling down the stairs and breaking a foot, Nash received her last drama school rejection. “Right,” she thought, “all my friends were at university and I literally wasn’t going anywhere. So I did my first gig to try and ignite something. I was petrified, but I loved it.” At the end of her set, the promoter handed her £30. “Wait,” Nash remembers thinking, “I could get paid for this?” She quit Nando’s. It was through Myspace that she found success, and fast. “I still think it was the best era for music,” she says, fondly. “There’s never been a time before or since when teenagers were able to choose what became successful.” Before then, power rested in industry gatekeepers and execs; now, she reckons, fortunes rest in the hands of streaming playlisters. “But Myspace was teenagers running the whole fucking thing. It has never been as free. A lot of unique artists were able to thrive because of it.” By 2008, Nash was a world-recognised star, touring the globe and picking up the best British female artist gong at that year’s Brit Awards. The single, Foundations, remains a generation’s anthem, its lyrical brilliance unfaded: “You said I must eat so many lemons, cause I am so bitter. I said, ‘I’d rather be with your friends, mate, Cause they are much fitter.’” Tabloid attention wasn’t comfortable for a teenage girl, but the highs and lows of that time are hazy. “I was still a child,” she says. “There was lots of acne and stress, but that’s adolescence, too. And there wasn’t social media in the same way.” She’s still grateful for that. “I didn’t have to be composed like you do now. I could still be a teenager. When I see girls of that age today, I realise just how young I was.” Everything happening so quickly certainly helped. There was no protracted period when she could let the hype of celebrity take over. “I remember being backstage at an awards ceremony in the gifting suite,” she says, “and this woman there was being so nice to me. I was drunk and 19 and just thought: ‘Jesus if I still worked at Nando’s, this woman wouldn’t give a fuck about me.’ I definitely always knew that.” Skipping a record label’s A&R pipeline may have sometimes left her unprepared for life in the spotlight, but it also instilled in her a sense of creative freedom. Nash’s second album, My Best Friend is You, released in 2010, charted in the Top 10. But two years later, after recording her third, Girl Talk, she was dropped by her label via text. Exactly what happened, she’s still unsure. Maybe they didn’t like her music’s self-set direction. “They didn’t communicate,” she says. “I was kept in the dark. I was dropped in a message, then that person got on a flight so I had nobody to speak to. We’ve never had that conversation to this day.” It was hard, yes, but Nash powered on. “I had a rocket up my arse,” she says. “I felt so angry and abandoned, but it was like my friends and I were driving this runaway train we had to keep on track.” Touring that record became a transformative experience, preparing her, too, for the graft needed to go it alone in the future. Then the documentary came along. Things started to crumble. There’s a feelgood happy ending in the resulting film: Nash successfully crowdfunds her fourth album, Yesterday Was Forever, before performing to an adoring audience. In reality, though, it was being cast in Glow – a Netflix fictionalisation of the 1980s American Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling troupe – that rescued Nash from the depths. There was the financial stability the production brought, yes, but for Nash it was nothing short of a salvation. “It fucking saved me,” she says. “I can recommend joining 15 women in a wrestling ring as a way to heal from trauma. You don’t make the best decisions about who should be in your life when you’re in a bad place. Those women made me realise it: friends, relationships, work. Who I was letting into my heart. My self-esteem was in the gutter.” After years of knocks, learning to fight built her up. “Within a week we were in each other’s crotches and armpits, body slamming and jumping on each other,” she says, still emotional now. Does she ever wonder what might have happened if she’d not been cast? “Yes, I have questioned it. But honestly it doesn’t bear thinking about.” For the past month, Nash has been working in New York, workshopping a theatre project over a decade in the offing. The finer details, she says, will be announced in the coming weeks, but she’s written a musical in which she’ll also perform: there’ll be new compositions, alongside favourites from her back catalogue. After Covid delays, the feature film she’s in alongside Derry Girls’ Saoirse-Monica Jackson and Sally Phillips might finally be released; there’s a new album in the works and a tour of the UK and Europe. She’s lived in LA on and off since 2014, but for the first time in a long time she now feels life is stable. In 2017, while she was touring the UK, dinner with an old friend turned into an “accidental date”. They got together, and he moved stateside to join her and her two rescue dogs. Nash remembers reading something Patti Smith said in an interview. “She explained, as an artist, there are times when everyone wants to come to your show. You’re the most exciting thing. And at other points, you’re reading from a poetry book nobody wants to buy.” There have been times when the success of Nash’s debut felt something of a poisoned chalice – no record since has gone on to achieve the same recognition. “There was definitely a period when I was younger when I was frustrated with it,” she says. “It was difficult during my second record, because back then I was sick of playing the same songs over and over.” Today? Nash feels only love for that album. She’s built a life on its foundation. “That record is filled with nostalgia for who I was before,” she says, “but those songs have also been a constant in my life. With me through everything.” When she steps out on tour later this month, for the first time since the pandemic shut venue doors, it’ll be a joyous experience. “I’m at a place where I can look back and feel proud of my younger self. When an audience sings every fucking word back at me,” she says, “I know what it means to them. It’s a rare, special feeling.” She wrote those songs when she was young and open. Recently, she’s once again come to embrace those vulnerabilities. “We give ourselves a hard time in music,” Nash says. “Yes, Rhianna might have endless number ones. But achieving something great is special, even if it doesn’t happen repeatedly. I’ll never have a Glow again. Maybe I’ll never have another Foundations. Hopefully I’ll have something else, of course, but I’m so lucky to have even had them.” Compared to their US counterparts, Nash believes British musicians have a funny relationship with their creative output. “It’s a very English thing to downplay it all,” she says. In California, there’s space to take it all a little more seriously, without fear of being portrayed as pretentious or cut down to size by an unforgiving tabloid media. “There have been times where I’ve really asked: ‘Why am I fighting so hard to keep this going?’” Giving up would have proved far easier. Now Nash thinks she knows the answer. “Writing lyrics and music is what sustains me. I’ll still be doing it when I’m 85, whether or not anyone’s listening.” Kate Nash’s EU/UK tour begins on 12 May and runs until 1 June (katenash.com)",Arts/Music,Kate Nash: ‘Giving up would have been so easy’,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/01/kate-nash-singer-songwriter-interview-tour-giving-up-would-have-been-so-easy
5/1/2022,"Serum or cream, cream or serum – this is the great debate for undereyes. Like most things, it’s all about personal preference. Some people like the creamy texture of a moisturising cream, while others crave the silky-smooth lightness of a serum. But if you want more visible results, a serum is the way to go. They are more concentrated, meaning deeper penetration because they are less diluted. Don’t get caught out with all the fancy jargon on the packaging: the real key is in the ingredients. “When picking a serum, I would recommend looking for ingredients such as peptides for boosting collagen, vitamin C for brightening and retinol for fine lines and wrinkles,” says Daniel Ezra, a renowned eye surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital and Neo Health Clinic on Harley Street. Another pro to add to the (ever-growing) serum column is the gel-like consistency. It’s quick to absorb, so it slips into your beauty routine and sits well under makeup. However, in common with all beauty products, results aren’t instant. Consistency is a must. I can’t promise you’ll suddenly look like you’ve finally got those important eight hours, but you will work your way up to it. 1. Triple Correction Eye Serum £70, Dr Dennis Gross (selfridges.com)2.

5/1/2022,"Iwas in the midst of the exuberant throng at the Royal Festival Hall on that warm night in May 1997. I enjoyed the never to be repeated spectacle of Neil Kinnock, Peter Mandelson and John Prescott jigging their limbs to D:Ream’s Things Can Only Get Better. I was deafened by the raucous celebrations as Tory MP after Tory MP was engulfed by the Labour landslide. Wild cheers greeted the defeat of Neil Hamilton, oily epitome of the Tory sleaze of that time. “Out! Out! Out!” the celebrants roared when Michael Portillo, quiffed embodiment of Tory arrogance, became one of seven cabinet ministers to lose his seat. And I watched as the sun peeped over the Thames and Tony Blair, with characteristically impeccable timing, declared to the ecstatic crowd: “A new dawn has broken, has it not?” Labour had achieved a landslide majority of 179, so whopping that it bested even Clement Attlee’s landmark victory in 1945. The curtain crashed down on 18 long years of Tory rule to usher in an unprecedented 13 years of Labour government. The 25th anniversary of that famous victory is a bittersweet moment for anyone Labour or anyone who thinks Britain is ill-served by unrelentingly long stretches of rightwing government. The architects of New Labour did not want their period in power to be the exception to Tory rule. As David Miliband will say in a speech this week: “Blair, Blair, Blair, lose, lose, lose, lose is not the history we wanted to write.” Labour is coming up to another anniversary, this one entirely miserable: its 12th full year in opposition since the 2010 defeat terminated the era that began in 1997. Many contend there is nothing much to learn from then because the world is now a very different place. I agree that today’s Labour party won’t profit by blindly trying to replicate the methods, ideas and policies of a quarter of a century ago, but there are enduring lessons that will repay study by Sir Keir Starmer and his team. A fierce hunger to change the landscape of British politics. That was a notable characteristic of Mr Blair and his tight group of self-styled modernisers. They burnt with a passion to win for a party that had suffered four back-to-back defeats. It is sometimes said their key insight was that principles are redundant without power. This could only be called an insight in reference to Labour, a party too often populated with people who believe winning elections has to entail betraying your values. To Tories, it is not an insight to say that achieving office matters. It is a statement of the bleeding obvious. John Major’s parliamentary majority was evaporating to nothing, the country was fed up with his rancorous government and Mr Blair inherited a poll lead when he became leader in 1994. Yet he never presumed that the Tories would relinquish office without a fight or that power would fall into his lap. Even when Labour was registering sustained and huge leads, he was “an eternal warrior against complacency”. The size of the ’97 landslide has given rise to an anti-New Labour argument from some on the left that the party was always destined to win whoever led it and whatever it presented to the public. That’s not true. New Labour won because it did not treat victory as inevitable. That refusal to take the voters for granted was accompanied by boldness in making the political weather. It is often noted how aggressively Mr Blair swept aside intellectually barren and electorally damaging leftwing shibboleths, such as the antique, nationalise-everything clause IV of the party’s constitution. It is less often remarked how ferociously New Labour’s formidable campaign machine hastened the Tories to their doom. Mr Blair never wasted an opportunity to exploit the fractious state of the Conservative party to demolish the public character of his Tory rival. “Weak, weak, weak,” he ridiculed the other man across the dispatch box. “I lead my party, he follows his” was another sizzling Blair zinger that fed on the weakness of the incumbent to build the strength of the challenger. Confidence in performance was accompanied by care about policy. The determination to make the party fireproof from rightwing attacks led to a 1997 manifesto that laid the greatest emphasis on what Labour would not do. No increases in any of the rates of income tax. No ditching of the nuclear deterrent. No more overall spending than that planned by the Conservatives for the first two years. This banished the anxieties of swing voters about whether they were to be trusted with security and the economy, previously a fatal handicap that had cost Labour earlier elections. Where there were firm policies, they were signature demonstrations of an updated social democracy framed in a way to be appealing. A Gordon Brown classic of the genre was the windfall tax on the privatised utilities, disliked monopolies making bumper profits, to fund a “new deal” for the unemployed. The five promises on the “pledge card” included achievable-sounding improvements to health, education and crime rates that served as tokens of a wider commitment to revive public services dilapidated by Tory neglect. In his memoirs, Mr Blair says that the manifesto was written “essentially to capture a mood” rather than as a detailed prospectus for government. Miliband, who wrote the document, says that a test for every policy was how it contributed to the overarching project of changing perceptions of the party, speaking to the concerns of the country, expressing their ambitions for government and rallying support. “Everything was driven by a need to marry a new position for Labour with a new direction for Britain.” The years that followed delivered many legacies for progressives to be proud of, including the introduction of the first minimum wage, the revitalisation of the NHS and state education, impressive reductions in child and pensioner poverty, civil partnerships, devolution and the peace agreement in Northern Ireland. I have sympathy with the argument that New Labour was too relaxed about rampant finance capitalism and too heedless of the downsides of globalisation, but it successfully used its 13 years in office to shift the centre of gravity of British politics to the left in many significant respects. It also, as all governments do, disappointed. Today, even many of those old enough to have been witnesses struggle to recall just what a phenomenon Mr Blair was as an aspirant prime minister. Memories of his immense popularity have been over-layered with subsequent disillusionment, notably because of the grisly aftermath of the invasion of Iraq. In 1997, it was an enormous asset to have a charming, fluent and youthful leader (he was not yet 44 when he became prime minister) who was a superb communicator with a rare talent for transcending Britain’s traditional political battle lines. When he voiced his ambition to modernise the country, it was more credible because he looked and sounded modern, especially in contrast to a decayed and decadent Tory party. He was most brilliant at articulating an optimistic argument with wide appeal that his New Britain would be a tolerant, thriving country that married social justice and decent public services with aspiration and rewards for success. So these are the lessons to be learned from the only period in our history when it looked as though Labour, rather than the Conservatives, was Britain’s default choice of government. Labour can achieve radical advances in office, but only once it has found a blend of soothing reassurance and galvanising vision that convinces the country the party is fit to wield power and has a plan for using it fruitfully. There needs to be a project for victory, led with verve and flair from the top, which is coherent at every level and relentlessly executed every hour of every day of every week. Be merciless in taking apart your opponents. Bomb-proof yourself against the inevitable counter-offensives from the right and its media. Have policies – it is the quality not the quantity that matters – that are credible answers to the urgent needs of the country and emblematic of how you intend to change Britain for the better. Make your story of reform and renewal so compelling that it inspires voters. New Labour secured that historic landslide by ticking every box. Sir Keir Starmer isn’t going to win the next election by trying to turn himself into Tony Blair because he couldn’t do it even if he wanted to. You will struggle to find anyone who thinks his Labour party is on course for a Blair-style landslide. What Sir Keir can do is ruthlessly examine the list of lessons and ask himself how many of the boxes can today’s Labour party tick with confidence.
