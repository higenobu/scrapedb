3/17/2022,"Day one (24 February) I woke up to the sound of explosions and, immediately, my dream evaporated. I looked at my phone and saw it was 4.50am. I found my backpack, woke my children and told them to pack theirs. We decided to leave. The railway station was closed so we attempted to travel by bus instead. We waited for the 4pm bus to Poland but it didn’t turn up. We tried to hitchhike but everyone sped past. Eventually, we got on a bus to Mykolaiv because the driver assured us that we would be able to travel west from there. Everyone on board was nervous because it was announced there would be more shelling in Kherson at 6pm. We left at 6.05pm. In Mykolaiv, we were met by an empty bus station, desperate passengers and a fast approaching curfew. The dispatcher said there would be no transport until the morning and there was no schedule for the following day at all. I did not want to get stuck in Mykolaiv for an indefinite period. Those who wanted to get to Lviv begged a taxi driver. He refused as he was worried he may not be able to return home. He said he would take us back to Kherson though. So we went straight back to my mum’s flat. My son was asking all the time “is everything very bad? Won’t we die? Promise that everything will be OK”. I didn’t know what to say so I just held his hand. Day two (25 February) All night and all morning the air raid sirens howled. Shells blew up. We ate ice-cream. The Russians had just crossed the Antonovskiy Bridge and were firing at civilian vehicles. Public transport had stopped, there were very few cars, and almost no people. Some families with sleeping bags arranged to spend the night in the garage. We went out to get spring water and when we were in the middle of the bridge, a melody from the city clock, the song about the Dnipro river (“Oh, Dnipro, Dnipro, you are wide and mighty”) sounded nearby. It was epic. We are in Kherson. Cut off from the world. I wanted to take the children to a quieter place, but we can’t go to Lviv, because it is a battle zone on the way, and trains haven’t been running since the day before yesterday, buses too. I was falling into despair. My dad collected warm clothes for humanitarian aid before he went to bed. I made a discovery – it was not just the enemy aircraft I could hear during the night but my father’s snoring. Day four (27 February) I went to my home and cleaned the bedroom. I sealed the window with tape and took the cat out of the house. I told my son to seal the window in the kitchen with tape. He sealed the glass with almost an entire layer. It turned out to be such psychotherapy. I reassured dad about the overspending of material in a crisis, and showed him the second roll of tape. I collected all the glass vases and porcelain figurines, put them in a box and continued dusting all over the apartment. Later I thought many times about why I came back from Mykolaiv to Kherson. The answer is that I didn’t want my kids to stay on the dark cold station for the whole night. I was one hour away from my warm home. I thought I could sleep at home and leave for Poland in the morning. I was mistaken – there was no transport, no opportunity to leave the next day, nor any other day. Some people left, but I knew about that later, and it was a big risk. Some of them passed by Russian roadblocks and the others were shot in their cars. Day seven (2 March) People took away the Ukrainian flag from Russian soldiers, which they were trying to remove from an administrative building. Kherson is still ours, just surrounded – and with armed enemy soldiers, roadblocks and internet outages. I am still looking for ways to get out of the city but there are none. I read Harry Potter to my kids in the evenings so they don’t focus on the explosions. My son has high blood pressure sometimes and when he feels dizzy, he just lies on the armchair. My daughter sits half a day with her cat on her knees in the corner and keeps silent. I hold the children before going to bed, they don’t want to let my hands go. On Tuesdays and Saturdays, we have literary meetings on Zoom. It’s been that way since quarantine. Usually we read our own poems and stories, sometimes of other authors. Doing analysis, sharing thoughts, giving tips. The last meetings begin with questions about what is going on with anyone. In Kyiv, Cherkasy, Lviv, Khmelnytskyi. Poems have faded into the background. We are just glad to see and hear each other and to know that we are all alive. Day eight (3 March) The Russian occupation has merged into one long, endless day. We were surrounded, and the approaches to the city had been blocked for several days. Russian troops are trying to rob grocery stores, but since 27 February, almost all the shelves have been emptied. Yesterday, one of my friends walked around his district and for two hours couldn’t find an open shop. Then he ran into five submachine gunners, who asked him for directions. The soldiers said they had come from Crimea to defend Ukraine from Nazis. Everyone is on edge. Children are afraid to sleep, parents are afraid that food will run out, I want to get out of here and I can’t. I’m not a fan of food, so I don’t care any more and I tell my mum not to worry about the children. The bakery distributes free bread to outlets and some pharmacies are open. I don’t know what to do with the fact that mobile connections and communications are often cut and in some areas the internet has already been lost. Without objective information, it would be difficult to navigate the situation. I read that the Russians sent humanitarian aid from Crimea to us. Are they kidding? Everything was fine with us until the Russian troops invaded, we did not need to be freed from anyone. We do not suffer from fictional Ukrainian Nazis. Russians came to our land with weapons, cut us off from the world, and now they are bringing food? Day 11 (6 March) Kherson residents decided to protest and say that Kherson is Ukraine. And they have said it. It is a fact that people did not take Russian humanitarian aid. Instead, we gathered on the central square for two days in a large crowd of several thousand people and shouted “home”, “Kherson is Ukraine!.” We have little destruction in our city, compared with Kharkiv, so it’s generally silly for us to complain too much. There has been constant bombing in Kharkiv, a blockade in Mariupol, terrible shelling near Kyiv. There have been so many victims. Now hatred is en vogue but I feel sorry for people on both sides. The Russians believe that their troops came to Ukraine to save us from the nationalists. “Nationalists” is a horror story of Russian state propaganda. In our country, this word has a completely different meaning – a person who recognises him or herself as a representative of the Ukrainian nation and respects the culture of his people. So, almost everyone is “nationalist”. The past week (8-15 March) My daughter draws dogs, cuts them out with scissors, gives them names and ID cards. She makes beds, toys and clothes for them. Some dogs have puppies. Dozens of dogs live around her and defend her from the lifequake. She presented me with one dog. It’s really cute. Despite the Russian occupation, volunteers are doing a great job. They rush around the city, delivering free medicines and products to people who need it. People who stayed in Kherson are doing their best. They coordinate taking out garbage, working in hospitals, fixing communications and carrying out repair work. People even deal with crime without police, apart from the main criminal element – the Russian invasion. They place tanks and other heavy vehicles in the streets and yards close to schools, churches and inhabited buildings. Their soldiers disperse peaceful demonstrations with rubber bullets and shoot submachine guns into the air. Sometimes Russians come into apartments and take notebooks, other devices and even people from their homes. They are looking for coordinators of demonstrations, not understanding that almost every Kherson citizen is the coordinator of freedom and democracy. I am proud of Kherson and I cry about it every night.",News/World news,"‘Sirens howl, bombs fall.

3/17/2022,"The Royal Opera House’s new production of Peter Grimes opens tonight with Allan Clayton in the title role. Benjamin Britten’s opera premiered at Sadler’s Wells theatre in 1945. “Here at last was a real English opera … nothing like this had ever happened before in English music,” said composer and conductor Imogen Holst after its premiere. “Masterly writing … genius … a most thrilling work,” declared William Glock, reviewing for the Observer. Allan Clayton and Bryn Terfel photographed from the wings during rehearsals Britten’s opera is based on a chapter from George Crabbe’s 1810 verse narrative The Borough. It tells of a lonely fisherman in an isolated and claustrophobic coastal village who causes the death of his young apprentices and loses his mind out of guilt and fear. “Britten’s version differs very much from Crabbe’s original poem,” says Allan Clayton, who sings the title role. “In the former he’s a really nasty piece of work and gets his comeuppance, but in Britten’s treatment it’s grey, not black and white.” Sam Morris and Stephen Richardson in rehearsal, rousing the lynch mob that marches to Grimes’ cliff-top hut “A central feeling for us,” wrote Britten of his opera, “was that of the individual against the crowd, with ironic overtones for our own situation.” Conscientious objectors, Britten and his partner Peter Pears had left Europe for the US during the war. As gay men at a time when homosexuality was illegal the two were doubly outsiders. Britten’s Grimes is more sinned against than sinner. “There is nothing in the music or the words to indicate that he is a dramatisation of what Crabbe wrote about originally,” says conductor Mark Elder. “Crabbe wrote about a murderer. Britten’s Grimes is not even an abuser. He’s a bully, he’s short-tempered and unpredictable but he doesn’t lay hands on the boy. This Grimes is a lost soul, who doesn’t know how to live in a community, [but he is also] a poet and a visionary. ” Alexandra Lowe and Jennifer France as landlady Auntie’s ‘nieces’ in The Boar, the Borough’s pub Clayton as Peter Grimes “For me, it all began at the end,” says Clayton, who made his role debut as Grimes when Deborah Warner’s production premiered in Madrid in April 2021. “I started with this so-called mad scene – I wanted to know what that was in reality. It’s very clearly a complete psychotic break. I read academic papers and tried to understand it, it was important that that was nailed on and then I could work back to the events leading up to that. If you think of the traumatic events he goes through over the course of the opera – the last two months of his life, say, it really does help shape things. He’s not blameless in what happens, but his sin is more one of negligence.” Clayton with Cruz Fitz (John, the apprentice) on stage during a break in rehearsals Warner’s production is set in today’s world. “We were keen to bring this story alive in a contemporary frame and not get caught in dangerous sentimentalisation of the poverty of the past, where the true pains and grudges birthed by deprivation can get lost. The poor and depressed nature of the community is central to the piece … Peter Grimes is rejected by a savage and stressed community, and that had to feel immediate,” she says. “The difficulty with this piece for a modern day audience is that you’re talking about an apprentice in a way that made sense in early 19th-century England but how do you make sense of that in a modern society?” adds Clayton. “The great Philip Langridge – who did this role many times – said were he stage a production, every man on stage would have an apprentice because that’s how normal it was.” “I would argue that this is the national opera of Britain,” says Clayton “and to do it here in this House, with this company, and this conductor, is particularly special. Literally outside my dressing room there’s a picture of Peter Pears as Peter Grimes – for whom the role was written, that I walk past every time I go on stage.” Cruz Fitz (the apprentice) and Maria Bengtsson The role of Ellen – the only unambiguously good character on stage, can be difficult to breathe life into. “I had my problems with her before I got to know Deborah” agrees Swedish soprano Maria Bengtsson. But in Warner’s production the two have created “a strong real and courageous modern woman”. Ellen, like Grimes, she points out, is an outsider in the community, lonely and seeking love. “Ellen sees that she can maybe help Peter by listening to him without judging him like the others do. She defends the weak in society – she also tries to help the boy. In her very first aria in the first act she says: ‘Let her among you without fault/ Cast the first stone.’ ie none of you are saints. So let me try to help Peter rather than condemn him.” Maria Bengtsson photographed in the wings Maria Bengtsson and Allan Clayton Deborah Warner, seated far right, talks to the principal singers in the Peter Grimes cast before rehearsal at the Royal Opera House Bryn Terfel plays Captain Balstrode, the closest thing Grimes has to a friend in the Borough. He first sung the role 24 years ago also in Covent Garden, in Elijah Moshinsky’s production. “The opera is as relevant and powerful today as it was when it was first written. “In the end everybody has the sense of having blood on their hands. Sometimes I walk away with tears in my eyes,” he says. Bryn Terfel in rehearsal Bryn Terfel and Jacques Imbrailo Jacques Imbrailo plays Ned Keene. “In this production Ned is a bit of a wide-boy, a wheeler dealer who gets stuff off the back of lorries. My costume is all bling and bumbag. I get the community what they need. Whether laudanum for Mrs Sedley, or even a boy apprentice for Peter.” Imbrailo grew up in South Africa and first encountered Britten as a student at London’s Royal College of Music. “His music is just remarkable. Ravishing. Heartbreaking. It’s always satisfying to sing partly as it’s so beautifully written but also the characters he creates are so rich” Clockwise from top left: Catherine Wyn-Rogers, John Graham-Hall, John Tomlinson and Rosie Aldridge Catherine Wyn-Rogers is Auntie: “She runs the local pub, she’s a business woman and keeps on the right side of everybody. She’s been there, seen that, done it all, so she has a great understanding and experience of human nature.” John Graham-Hall is Bob Boles, a fisherman and Methodist. “He hates Grimes,” says Graham-Hall. “Although he probably hates himself as well. He spends the whole of the first act trying – and failing – to get everybody in the village going; by act two he has convinced people that the death of the first apprentice was entirely Peter’s fault, and there’s a witch hunt to go and lynch him.” Rosie Aldridge is Mrs Sedley. “Much of the comedy in the opera comes from her but there’s nothing funny about Mrs Sedley – she’s toxic and dangerous and a bigot. She’s addicted to pain killers and is obviously a very deeply unhappy person. She scuttles about like a mad woman and she can’t keep still – she’s always fidgeting. I quite often have anxiety after I’ve come off stage at the end of the evening because she has such high energy. I have to take deep breaths and make a conscious effort sometimes to let her go!” Swallow, the magistrate and coroner is sung by bass John Tomlinson. Terfel with Graham-Hall Bob Boles is an unlikable character, but, as Graham-Hall points out: “He spends an awful lot of time saying what might be regarded as common sense, at least today – for example, this apprentice system is uncivilised and unchristian.” John Tomlinson, Jennifer France and Alexandra Lowe photographed from the wings during rehearsals “Britten’s Grimes is haunted by the horror of a recent accident, horrified by rumour’s tongue, and someone who – perhaps – always did things differently to those around him. The Borough has no appetite for difference. It is not only poor and narrow, but very solid … a sort of moral brick wall, cut off and blinkered,” says Warner. Conductor Mark Elder and director Deborah Warner “We had our first two orchestral rehearsals last week and literally four of those six hours I was covered in goosebumps. The music is just extraordinary, and especially with this orchestra under Mark Elder it’s the best of the best,” says Clayton. “This music doesn’t work unless the edges are sharp,” says Elder. “There can be no fat sounds, like in so much of Britten, and that means that everybody has to have an incredible awareness and commitment to the control of the pulse of the music. The colours of the story are mirrored in the colours of the orchestra. It’s not a wash of colour – like, say, Debussy; those Aldeburgh beaches are pebbly, and the skies are grey. It’s not acres of gorgeous sand.” Conductor Mark Elder in the pit during rehearsals Movement director Kim Brandstrup, assistant director Isabelle Kettle, director Deborah Warner and lighting designer Peter Mumford working in the ROH stalls “Britten managed to find sounds from the orchestra that capture something that he knew … there is an ability to rouse passion but his music is very clever. He was a master of knowing how to dish up his ingredients, better probably than any other 20th-century composer. He set words so beautifully. Most of it is so cleverly written that if it is cast right, it works,” continues Elder. Clayton and aerialist Jamie Higgins in rehearsal “Creating a new Peter Grimes is like directing Hamlet: you do it when, and if, you find the right performer for the part,” says Warner. “Grimes is a very complicated character. I’ve always struggled with feeling very sorry for him but also it’s hard not to see him as a predator, adds Aldridge. “I think audiences will come away from this production feeling absolutely desperate for him. It is heartbreaking. Allan has made him so human and you just want to make it better for him.”  Deborah Warner’s staging of Peter Grimes is at the Royal Opera House, London, until 31 March, and at Opéra National de Paris in January 2023. It will be filmed and available to watch on demand at a future date, check stream.roh.org.uk for details.

3/17/2022,"The Bank of England has responded to the likelihood that the war in Ukraine will push inflation to around 10% this year by raising interest rates back to the pre-pandemic level of 0.75%. Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee (MPC) voted 8-1 to increase borrowing costs by 0.25 percentage points – the first time the Bank has raised rates at three successive meetings in more than two decades. The Bank said Russia’s invasion had forced it to rethink its forecast for the peak of inflation this year and it was now expected to be “several percentage points” higher than the 7.25% it had previously forecast. There had been speculation ahead of the meeting that some MPC members might opt for a half-point increase, but only one – John Cunliffe – dissented from the majority by voting to keep interest rates on hold. The other eight MPC members decided fresh action was needed to return inflation – currently at a three-decade high of 5.5% – to the government’s 2% target. They stressed the tightness of the labour market and upward pressures on costs and prices. Minutes of the meeting are likely to stoke fears that the economy is heading for a period of stagflation – weak growth and strong upward price pressures. “Developments since the February report are likely to accentuate both the peak in inflation and the adverse impact on activity by intensifying the squeeze on household incomes” the Bank said. “Global inflationary pressures will strengthen considerably further over coming months, while growth in economies that are net energy importers, including the UK, is likely to slow.” The Bank said growth in January had been stronger than expected but consumer confidence was being hit by falling living standards. “That impact on real aggregate income is now likely to be materially larger than implied in the February report, consistent with a weaker outlook for growth and employment, all else equal.” Despite strong inflationary pressure, the Bank adopted a less aggressive tone about future rate increases than the US Federal Reserve, which is pencilling in a further six increases in borrowing costs this year. The MPC said a further “modest” tightening of policy could be needed over the coming months, depending on the medium-term outlook for inflation. The Bank thinks the annual inflation rate will rise to around 8% in the second quarter of 2022, and perhaps even higher later this year. There was a risk that, if sustained, rising energy prices would lead the UK energy regulator Ofgem to push its price cap “substantially” higher in October. “This could temporarily push inflation around the end of this year above the level projected in April, which was previously expected to be the peak. Further out, inflation is expected to fall back materially, as energy prices stop rising and as the squeeze on real incomes and demand puts significant downward pressure on domestically-generated inflation.” The Bank said it could do nothing to prevent higher prices for energy and other commodities hitting living standards. “The economy has recently been subject to a succession of very large shocks. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is another such shock,” it said. The Bank raised rates for the first time in December, from 0.1% to 0.25% and increased them further – to 0.5% in February.",News/Business,Bank of England raises interest rates to 0.75% as inflation soars,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/17/uk-interest-rates-raised-bank-of-england
3/17/2022,"Some boys are taught by their fathers how to skim stones or bowl cricket balls. Mine taught me a far more important life skill: how to politely summon the bill in a restaurant from a distance. A hand raised. An eye caught across the dining room. The flourish of an invisible pen, writing a cheque in the air. Job done. Or at least it was once an important skill. Recently, I raised my hand and scribbled in the air at the delightful twentysomething who had been serving us. And I realised what a ludicrous gesture this now was. Sure, they understood, but God knows how. It’s likely they’ve never written a cheque. We have not yet come up with an internationally recognised gesture for putting your pin number into a card reader, or holding your phone against it. But the cheque-scribbling thing is definitely out of date. This makes me sad. I loved doing the whole invisible cheque-writing thing. It felt suave. The restaurant business loves retro. When the ineffably cool Maison François opened in St James’s in London in 2020, diners swooned over its dessert trolley as if the 1970s was a neglected decade deserving of love. When the great Otto’s opened in 2011, it was celebrated for having a duck press and using it like it was 1922. Still, there are some things in the restaurant world that can never be rescued from obsolescence. We do not mourn all of them. I am old enough to recall when the starters would include a glass of orange juice or, if you were feeling really adventurous, a fruit cocktail, served in a stainless-steel coupe, topped with a maraschino cherry, from which the clingfilm had lovingly been ripped off only moments before. Farewell. There are others, however, which, while occasionally still available, risk becoming as rare as a sober night in Downing Street. For example, chicken in a basket. I used to love chicken in a basket when I was a kid. It was your dinner. Served in a basket. How cool was that? I haven’t seen it on a menu in years. It used to come on a doily. I worry about the doily industry. Quietly, I regret the passing of cutlet frills, those tiny paper chef hats that used to top the trimmed bones of lamb cutlets. You can find them in butchers, but they no longer make it to the table after the lamb is cooked. Fish knives are pointless, but I did love seeing them. Ditto melba toast and ridged curls of butter. Of course, these things do sometimes continue, for example at Oslo Court in London’s St John’s Wood, where it is forever 1974 and they serve a killer duck à l’orange. But that’s the point: they have retreated. I fear, for example, for the noble art of the napkin fold: the water lily, the bishop’s mitre or, best of all, the dying swan. Now it appears to live on mostly in the Indian restaurant sector. Eventually, even they’ll get bored of all that folding. Indian restaurants also tend to be where you find the last foil-wrapped mint chocolate at the end of the meal. Obviously, I love an artisan liquid-centred salted caramel truffle as much as the next urban sophisticate. But I did love that moment at the end of dinner when you burped spices and attempted to smooth out the foil. That’s the thing with getting older. It’s not just people that predecease you. It’s traditions too, lovely ones. I know writing invisible cheques in the air must go the way of all things. But I don’t have to be happy about it.",Lifestyle/Food,"Air-scribbling cheques will soon be a thing of the past, like fish knives | Jay Rayner",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/17/air-scribbling-cheques-will-soon-be-a-thing-of-the-past-like-fish-knives-and-melba-toast-jay-rayner
3/17/2022,"A rare unsympathetic outing for Kirsten Dunst in this much-loved true-life biographical drama about the African American female mathematicians at Nasa in the 60s, whose work was vital in getting the US into space. Dunst plays the white supervisor, Mrs Mitchell, who is coldly and blandly racist towards the women, and the role plays on her ability to project a kind of albino-eyed hostility. There’s something a bit by-the-numbers about this drama starring Julia Roberts as the unconventional art professor at the 50s women’s college who inspires the students. But Dunst has some big scenes as the smugly reactionary married student, Betty, who cannot come to terms with the fact that her marriage has become a sham. It is Betty who tearfully shows her uncaring mother a picture of the Mona Lisa and wonders what pain is concealed by her smile – any woman’s smile. This was the Richard-Curtis-style romcom that gave us a boyish Paul Bettany as the stammeringly Grant-esque tennis player who isn’t terribly good at tennis any more, meeting-cute at Wimbledon with the supercool bad girl of American tennis played by Dunst. The romantic spark reignites his tennis skill. Dunst gives it all she’s got but a straight romantic lead doesn’t quite work with her reserved and complicated emotional presence. The late 90s and early 00s became a new golden age of the Hollywood high school comedy, and Dunst was pretty much the cheerleader in chief. In this rather decent example, Ben Foster plays Berke, a heartbroken guy not getting over a breakup, and Dunst is Kelly, his best friend’s sister – smart, pretty and nicer than the vacuous mean girls. Kelly is in love with Berke, and their relationship blossoms during a school production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Kelly (playing Helena) has a great song at the end. Peter Bogdanovich revisited the aristocracy of Old Hollywood for this true-crime mystery based on the unsolved Hollywood Babylon case of the man who died mysteriously on William Randolph Hearst’s yacht. Dunst plays Hearst’s legendary protege and lover, Marion Davies. She is no airhead with a sugar-daddy complex, but a complex woman aware of her compromised position (which includes a flirtation with Charlie Chaplin), but able to accept it because of a belief that love will conquer all. One of the funniest films about Watergate was this ingenious counterfactual teen spin on the great political conspiracy. Dunst and Michelle Williams play two 15-year-old girls in 70s Washington who live in the Watergate building, and, one night, chance across the notorious burglary. From there, they find themselves in the White House, with Dan Hedaya playing Nixon himself. As ever, ditziness and blondness is weaponised into comedic strength, though it’s Dunst who plays the straighter of the two girls. In the mid-90s, Dunst emerged as a child actor with something mature and complicated about her. Two movies – wholesome and unwholesome – showcased this intriguing new talent. The wholesome one was Gillian Armstrong’s spirited and engaging version of the Louisa May Alcott classic, in which Dunst played the twinkly-eyed younger Amy March, who was one day to grow up and marry Laurie. Dunst gave an underrated and under-appreciated performance in this star crossed lovers drama. She plays Nicole, the daughter of a wealthy US congressman; she falls for Carlos, a smart Latino boy from the wrong side of the tracks. Her dad offers to pay Carlos’s military school fees if he will leave Nicole alone. Dunst brings the maturity of someone 10 or 20 years older to her role. An amusing cameo for Dunst as the utterly confused LA wannabe star Tracy Lime, who is cast by Robert De Niro’s spin doctor in the fake news clip he’s devising as part of his diversionary bogus war. She has to play the fleeing Albanian refugee with a kitten in her arms – only she’s running in front of a greenscreen holding a bag of chips, which will be digitally replaced later, and De Niro tells the wide-eyed Tracy that she mustn’t tell anyone about this. “Is is a guild thing?” she asks. Some Dunst fans feel that her greenscreen acting here is a premonition of her later role playing opposite Spider-Man. In her mature years, Dunst is periodically cast in schoolmarmish roles, and here is one with a weird hint of her breakthrough in Little Women. It’s the steamy, saucy American civil war tale from Dunst’s longtime director Sofia Coppola, featuring a wounded union soldier, played by Colin Farrell, who fetches up at a ladies’ seminary in the south whose ladies are all of a-flutter. Dunst plays the assistant to the headmistress (Nicole Kidman) and, like everyone else, she is secretly overexcited at this great big sweaty hunk of man. Dunst played the young beauty-queen hopeful in this cult mockumentary about the horrific world of teen pageants, hoping a win will be her ticket out of the boring Minnesota town in which she finds herself. Dunst had to hold her own against some of the most scene-stealing comic turns imaginable: her boozy mom, played by Ellen Barkin, and her mom’s plain-speaking best friend, played by Allison Janney, together with Amy Adams and Brittany Murphy as rivals for the tiara. As so often, Dunst is playing a basically straight role, but doing so with absolute sincerity and class. Dunst’s capacity for poignancy, pathos and victimhood is explored in this interesting drama based on a true-crime scandal, directed by Andrew Jarecki, who made the documentary Capturing the Friedmans, and went on to made a TV series exploring the real case this was based on. Dunst plays the free-spirited woman who married a wealthy young man (Ryan Gosling), initially a rebel against his rich background, who becomes more and more unpleasant, the more he is sucked back into his father’s dodgy, lucrative affairs. Dunst is very good as suggesting the claustrophobic unhappiness of a shy, romantic person. Dunst was the first among equals playing one of the entrancingly mysterious and tragic sisters in 70s Michigan who fascinate the boys next door in this unsettling, emo-ish romance of doom, directed by Sofia Coppola. Dunst plays Lux, the boldest and most free-spirited of the girls, whose mystique has something dark and tragic about it, since her youngest sister attempted to take her own life. Dunst’s precocity and maturity come across in this role with intensity and discreet passion. Dunst found a return to form in Jane Campion’s award-winning western psychodrama – again, in a movie in which she is in danger of being upstaged by the more showoff performers, she always makes her presence felt. In 1920s Montana, she is the widow with a sensitive teen son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who, on getting married, finds herself being bullied by psychotically insecure new brother-in-law, played by Benedict Cumberbatch. Again, she brings presence to a role of injured sensitivity and pride. Here is a cheerleader comedy that spawned a franchise and anticipated the Step Up and Pitch Perfect movies; it clearly emerged from the same era that gave us American Pie and American Beauty – but interestingly alluded to racial difference, which most Hollywood movies of that era (or maybe any era) didn’t. Dunst is Torrance, the pampered-princess chief cheerleader of a team that finds itself facing off with competitors from East Compton in LA, led by Gabrielle Union: plenty of needle but also much mutual respect at the last. This was the unwholesome film that made Dunst a star – alongside the wholesome Little Women that same year – playing the infant vampire Claudia. Some Dunst fans believe she has never quite equalled the strange precocity and subversively toxic primness of the role, particularly her great transformation scene with Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise who, as Louis and Lestat, are to be her non-heteronormative vampire family. Dunst was destined to play Mary Jane Watson, the unattainable love interest of Peter Parker and Spider-Man, with Tobey Maguire as Spidey himself. Dunst could play all the attributes: smart, sensitive, a bookish yet attractive person on whom crushes were to be had – with the girl-next-door vibe, but also game for adventure. Dunst is the classic Mary Jane in many ways, though in Spidey’s shadow – and the impression she makes deteriorates as the franchise itself declines. The first movie gave her one of early 21st-century Hollywood’s classic screen kisses, snogging with Spider-Man as he hangs upside down in the rain. In 2011, Dunst was to join the ranks of those stars (Nicole Kidman, Bryce Dallas Howard, Björk) who agreed to put themselves under the bewildering and even terrifying control of the veteran arthouse provocateur Lars von Trier. Dunst was to have a happier time than many in this film, and her performance won her the best actress award at Cannes. She plays the depressed Justine, whose wedding day is marred by emotional tensions; she descends into depression but then finds herself ecstatically thrilled by the news that a huge blue planet is going to crash into Earth. She wanders outside to bathe naked in the planet’s ethereal blue light. However silly, the film provides an operatically strange role for Dunst, something to get her teeth into. Dunst plays Mary Svevo, assistant to Tom Wilkinson’s memory-erasure specialist in this hugely loved movie from screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and director Michel Gondry. The movie is about the memory-tormented lovers Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, both giving star-quality performances – but it is Dunst’s poor, sad, shy Mary who crucially recites the lines from Pope that give the film its title: “How happy is the blameless virgin’s lot! / the world forgetting, by the world forgot. / Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! / Each pray’r accepted, and each wish resign’d.” Is she falling in love with her boss? Perhaps. But there is a terrible revelation in store for her. In Marie Antoinette, director Sofia Coppola gave Dunst her greatest role, the one that allowed Dunst to play on her talent for maturity and precocity, and also a high-status bearing bordering on entitlement. She can play romantic and sexy, but with a sisterly perspective, a way of seeing the reality behind the glamour, demythologising the feminine mystique she is obliged to project. Dunst is an actor who had made a very public progression, from teen roles to mature and melancholy ones. She and Coppola seem to riff on this with the great scene in which Marie Antoinette is taken from her Austrian homeland into a royal tent, and emerges into the Versailles court, where she would be queen – an instant and disorientating growing-up process. She was the very embodiment of doomed youth.",Arts/Culture,Kirsten Dunst’s 20 best performances – ranked! ,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/17/kirsten-dunsts-20-best-performances-ranked-power-of-the-dog-oscar-nomination
3/17/2022,"It’s interesting to compare the cover of Charli XCX’s fifth album with that of its 2020 predecessor, How I’m Feeling Now. The latter featured the now 29-year-old singer-songwriter reclining on a bed, staring distractedly at a video camera: a suitably understated, ostensibly off-the-cuff image for an album written and recorded on a whim during lockdown, whose contents were subject to input from her fans and whose making was documented in verité Instagram clips. By contrast, Crash arrives bearing a heavily staged photograph that looks like it came straight from a style magazine fashion shoot. It features XCX sprawled over the bonnet of a car in a bikini and heels, looking through a cracked windscreen with blood pouring from her forehead. What should be an image teeming with violence and shock-factor is nulled by the singer’s expression, though. For someone who is supposed to have been hit by a car, she looks oddly blank and bored; mildly sullen rather than shocked. With Crash – her final album for Atlantic – XCX says she decided to make “a major label album in the way that it’s actually done”, and embrace “everything that the life of a pop figurehead has to offer in today’s world – celebrity, obsession and global hits”. It’s a hairpin turn from her usual way of doing things: the off-piste diversions of her 2017 mixtape Pop 2, on which she scoured the globe for unlikely collaborators in order to imagine a pop world vastly more interesting, eclectic and colourful than the real thing; her frequent collaborations with PC Music producers, which propelled the emergence of the manic, extremely online sound of hyperpop. It’s astonishing that an artist signed to a major label since her teens has pulled off a career like this, but it’s also unsurprising that her relationship with the industry has been fractious. XCX has often seem torn over whether she aspires to chart success or the pop vanguard. She presents Crash as a bravely defiant experiment, kicking against the ongoing love for “authenticity” in pop, but the idea that making ultra-commercial, label-pleasing music is a bold act of rebellion doesn’t stand up to a vast amount ofscrutiny. What you might call mixed messaging leaks into the music. Crash deals in DayGlo choruses and thuddingly obvious interpolations of old hits that ratchet up the knowingness of XCX’s concept. Beg for You, which features Rina Sawayama, interpolates September’s 2006 Euro-dance hit Cry for You, which itself recalled Bronski Beat’s Smalltown Boy. Used to Know Me is essentially the influential Stonebridge remix of Robin S’s Show Me Love with a different vocal melody – one that isn’t as good as the one on Show Me Love. At times you can hear the weariness and cynicism creeping in, and these moments undersell XCX’s well-established talents as a writer and performer of straightforward, low-concept hits. The wan disco-pop of Baby, punctuated by oddly joyless, forced-sounding whoops, can’t compare to her 2014 hit Boom Clap or Icona Pop’s fabulous XCX-penned 2012 single I Love It. Some of the latter song’s screw-you spirit seeps into Yuck, a witty examination of the moment a partner’s quirks unexpectedly render them unfanciable. The title track stacks shards of vocal samples over an 80s boogie-inspired backing to potent effect. But contrary to its concept, Crash is at its best in its subtler moments. The frequently heartfelt lyrics pick their way through the various stages of a breakup, from wistful memory of a failed relationship’s flowering on Every Rule to regret on Good Ones and the lock-up-your-boyfriends bullishness of Baby. New Shapes is a charming collaboration with fellow pop outliers Caroline Polachek and Christine and the Queens. Every Rule, meanwhile, is sparse and moving, its lyrics fixed on small details – “cigarettes up on the balcony, wrapped in nothing but sheets” – but its mood overwhelming. The moments when XCX makes her distinctiveness felt put the weaker moments in even sharper relief. Listening to the AutoTune-heavy Constant Repeat or featherweight closer Twice, you wonder if there’s anything that separates this from the acres of boilerplate pop already out there. You can bang on about high concepts and process until you’re blue in the face but it doesn’t make the actual music any more interesting. Pop music isn’t conceptual art, however much critics with pretensions might want it to be. There’s nothing wrong with applying smart ideas to it, but the end result still has to be sparky and exciting regardless of the intention. Not only does Crash not work – or at least not entirely – it leaves you wondering about its author’s motivations. For all the messaging around it, it sometimes feels less like a smart concept than a shrug; the work of an artist seeing out a fraught five-album major label deal with a half-hearted “whatever”. If there’s a saving grace here, it’s that the mercurial XCX – now a free agent – will doubtless return with something more interesting sooner rather than later.",Arts/Music,"Charli XCX: Crash review – subverting pop’s rules, or just playing by them?",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/17/charli-xcx-crash-review-atlantic
3/17/2022,"Car W13 Engine Mercedes Principal Toto Wolff Debut France 1954 GPs 249 Titles 8 Last season Champions. Struggled in testing with a car that may prove to be more of a diva than previous models. It suffered from heavy “porpoising” (ie the car heavily jarring up and down on a straight) and a consequent lack of balance, brake-locking and understeer. Believe they can solve the issues and in doing so will have a very quick car but this may be the most trying opening to a campaign they have faced for many years. Drivers Lewis Hamilton (GB, age 37) No 44 Debut Australia 2007 Wins 103 Poles 103 Titles 7 Last season 2nd. Strongly motivated by the bitter disappointment of being controversially denied his eighth title in 2021’s season finale, Hamilton is geared up for a fight. He drove as well as he ever has last season and there are no signs he has lost any of his remarkable edge. If Mercedes can deliver the car he will be fearsomely hard to beat. George Russell (GB, 24) No 63 Debut Australia 2019 Wins 0 Best race finish 2nd Poles 0 Best qualifying 2nd Titles 0 Best season finish 15th Last season 15th. Delivered well at the back of the field for Williams but faces the toughest test of his career at the front of the grid and partnered with Hamilton. Has real pace, confidence and is clearly relishing this challenge. Should he step up to the challenge, how the dynamic within the team and across the garage develops will be fascinating. Car RB18 Engine Red Bull Principal Christian Horner Debut Australia 2005 GPs 325 Titles 4 Last season 2nd. Looked comfortably to have the best car in testing. Well-balanced, quick and reliable it was crucially less prone to porpoising than almost any other team, strong over the bumps and on long runs. Their final updates were a real step forward and on the back of a standout last season are confident and fired-up again. Enter as favourites for the opening rounds. Drivers Max Verstappen (Neth, 24) No 1 Debut Australia 2015 Wins 20 Poles 13 Titles 1 Last season Champion. The Dutchman is defending a title he genuinely earned last season, despite the manner in which it was clinched. He drove exceptionally well, if on occasion too aggressively but can be sublime. Fearless and unintimidated, he is soaring in confidence with that first title and has every chance to make it two this year. Sergio Pérez (Mex, 32) No 11 Debut Australia 2011 Wins 2 Poles 0 Best qualifying 2nd Titles 0 Best season finish 4th Last season 4th. Performed well in his first season with Red Bull but was comprehensively beaten by Verstappen. Will be expected to step up if he is to earn a seat beyond 2022. Needs to qualify stronger as Red Bull will expect a partner for Verstappen at the front and the Mexican, who has pace and touch, must deliver. Car F1-75 Engine Ferrari Principal Mattia Binotto Debut Monaco 1950 GPs 1,030 Titles 16 Last season 3rd. Having poured last year’s resources into this car, the Scuderia are hopeful of ending a win drought stretching back to 2019. They have every chance, the car is clearly quick, well-balanced, reliable and, crucially, the drivers are at ease with it. With an improved engine and a superb driver lineup, expectations are high. Drivers Charles Leclerc (Mon, 24) No 16 Debut Australia 2018 Wins 2 Poles 9 Titles 0 Best season finish 4th Last season 7th. Ferrari have huge faith in their young charger who has proved he can win but has yet to have the machinery to challenge consistently. If the car is there Leclerc will take it to Hamilton and Verstappen with verve. Out-drove an average car last year and will absolutely shine in a resurgent Ferrari. Carlos Sainz Jr (Sp, 27) No 55 Debut Australia 2015 Wins 0 Best race finish 2nd Poles 0 Best qualifying 2nd Titles 0 Best season finish 5th Last season 5th. Settled in well in his first season at Ferrari and against Leclerc around whom the team has been forged. The Spaniard has proved he has real talent with a fine touch and real consistency. Capable of at least matching Leclerc and if he does so having found his feet at Ferrari the pair will be a formidable partnership. Car MCL36 Engine Mercedes Principal Andreas Seidl Debut Monaco 1966 GPs 902 Titles 8 Last season 4th. Building on an upward curve from their recent nadir the team have produced an impressively quick car but one stymied in the second test by a front-brake cooling problem. Unable to solve it they lost time and long-running data. Solving the issue is paramount and should unleash a ride very much on the heels of the big three. Drivers Lando Norris (GB, 22) No 4 Debut Australia 2019 Wins 0 Best race finish 2nd Poles 1 Titles 0 Best season finish 6th Last season 6th. Beyond the title fight, Norris was the standout last season as he produced some of the best performances of his career. Often out-driving quicker cars, Norris has developed his pace with some fine judgment, decisive overtaking and is utterly unintimidated vying with the world champions against whom he is now being measured. A first win is easily achievable. Daniel Ricciardo (Aus, 32) No 3 Debut GB 2011 Wins 8 Poles 3 Titles 0 Best season finish 3rd Last season 8th. Struggled to adapt to his new ride at McLaren but began finding his feet in the final third of the season. Delivered a consummate victory at Monza, a reminder of this talent but this year will be expected to show his real form from the off in the new car. If he does, McLaren will have one of the best lineups on the grid. Car A522 Engine Renault Principal Otmar Szafnauer Debut Bahrain 2021 GPs 22 Last season 5th. Had the worst attack of the porpoises in early testing but appeared to have a handle on it by the close. The former Renault outfit are still in their rebuilding phase and taking on Szafnauer was a positive step. Likely once more to be mired in another tightly contested midfield fight but with a driver lineup able to shine when given the chance. DriversFernando Alonso (Spa, 40) No 14 Debut Australia 2001 Wins 32 Poles 22 Titles 2 Last season 10th. Still able to turn in eye-catching drives, Alonso remains ambitious and convinced he has lost none of his touch. The pace and judgment returned quickly last year after his sabbatical from F1, including a fine top-three finish in Qatar but he came back to compete and Alpine need to start coming good on their promise to give him the machinery to do so. Esteban Ocon (Fra, 25) No 31 Debut Belgium 2016 Wins 1 Poles 0 Best qualifying 3rd Titles 0 Best season finish 8th Last season 11th. Impressively well matched with Alonso last year and confirmed his promise with a deserved inaugural win in Hungary. Alpine recognised his talent, signing him until 2024. He is settled now and in the most promising seat of his career. Likely to be spurred on once more by Alonso, Ocon is a vital asset in the midfield battle. Car AT03 Engine Red Bull Principal Franz Tost Debut Austria 2020 GPs 39 Titles 0 Best finish 6th Last season 6th. Reliable and productive in testing, AlphaTauri put in an impressive number of laps and looked solid and pacey throughout. The Red Bull engine (effectively last year’s Honda unit) is clearly strong. If the drivers can return consistent points they have every chance to make life torrid for nearby rivals and even steal a podium if given the chance. Drivers Pierre Gasly (Fra, 26) No 10 Debut Malaysia 2017 Wins 1 Poles 0 Best qualifying 2nd Titles 0 Best season finish 7th Last season 9th. Still eager to make his point that he deserves another shot at the Red Bull seat, Gasly repeatedly showed some superb licks last season. His qualifying was often well beyond the expectations of the car and he is clearly more comfortable with the team than he was in the crucible of driving alongside Verstappen. Should go well. Yuki Tsunoda (Jpn, 21) No 22 Debut Bahrain 2021 Best race finish 4th Poles 0 Best qualifying 7th Titles 0 Best season finish 14th Last season 14th. Showed flashes of brilliance but was let down by too many unforced errors in his rookie season. Has a second chance to come good, he is fast but must temper the pace with control, eliminate the crashes and return good points if the Red Bull machine is not to discard him as too unreliable. This is make or break for Tsunoda. Car AMR22 Engine Mercedes Principal Mike Krack Debut Netherlands 1959 GPs 27 Titles 0 Best finish 7th Last season 7th. Quietly efficient in testing, Aston kept their heads down, put in the laps and they look strong on it. Not searching for lap time they did have impressive long-run speed and there were approving acknowledgments of the car from the drivers. The new principal heads a team that may well emerge to lead the midfield. Drivers Sebastian Vettel (Ger, 34) No 5 Debut USA 2007 Wins 53 Poles 57 Titles 4 Last season 12th. Appears to be enjoying driving a whole lot more since moving from Ferrari to Aston and in the cut and thrust of the midfield dogfight. The team are still expanding with a new factory and grand ambitions and Vettel seems to be at home. Proved last season he was able to turn in a quality shift and should lead the team in doing so again but will miss the opener due to Covid-19. Lance Stroll (Can, 23) No 18 Debut Australia 2017 Best race finish 3rd Poles 1 Titles 0 Best season finish 11th Last season 13th. A solid if unremarkable season last year did little to throw off the label that comes with racing for a team your father owns, but Stroll does occasionally shine, especially in qualifying. If Aston have a good car it will be perhaps the acid test of his career. With the team’s grand ambitions Stroll needs to prove he can deliver for the old man. Car FW44 Engine Mercedes Principal Jost Capito Debut Spain 1977 GPs 766 Titles 9 Last season 8th. Another year of building back under new owners after the Williams family sold the team and progress is not expected to be drastic. Enjoyed reasonable testing but lost time with a brake fire that was costly. However, they did good mileage, the car was stable and appears to be a solid platform on which to build. Can aim to challenge to be top of the back of the grid. Drivers Alexander Albon (Thai, 25) No 23 Debut Australia 2019 Wins 0 Best race finish 3rd Poles 0 Best qualifying 4th Titles 0 Best season finish 7th Last season N/A (7th in 2020). Returning after his torrid time alongside Verstappen at Red Bull and then a year out in DTM, this is a chance Albon will grasp. An opportunity to prove himself out of the spotlight, Russell has already shown how he could shine at the back with Williams and on his day Albon is capable of similar feats. A real asset for the team. Nicholas Latifi (Can, 26) No 6 Debut Austria 2020 Wins 0 Best race finish 7th Poles 0 Best qualifying 10th Titles 0 Best season finish 17th Last season 17th. Entering his third season, Latifi had been overshadowed by Russell and needs to prove he brings more than backing to the party. On occasion can put together quick laps but has yet to do so consistently. Williams are ambitious and at the very least Latifi must begin to match their aims by extracting the maximum from the car. Car C42 Engine Ferrari Principal Frédéric Vasseur Debut Britain 1950 GPs 170 Titles 0 Best finish 6th Last season 9th. Reliability problems plagued the first test – porpoising once more often to blame – but Alfa followed it with better running in Bahrain. They are on top of the bouncing and with the Ferrari engine look to have a quick car. Reliability remains the main concern but if they nail it Alfa could be the dark horse at the back. Drivers Valtteri Bottas (Fin, 32) No 77 Debut Australia 2013 Wins 10 Poles 20 Best season finish 2nd Last season 3rd. Thoroughly outraced by Hamilton at Mercedes, the Finn was not returning nearly good enough performances last season but may find a new lease of life at Alfa. When the car and indeed track are to his liking he can produce and will be expected to lead the team’s charge, a role he was never going to assume at Mercedes. Guanyu Zhou (Chi, 22) No 24 Rookie season Last year 3rd in F2. China’s first F1 driver will be enormous in his home country but his credentials beyond the backing he brings are unspectacular. He failed to light up F2 in his three seasons in the championship but did at least return some wins on his way to third last year. Faces a daunting task in being measured against the vastly more experienced Bottas. Car VF-22 Engine Ferrari Principal Guenther Steiner Debut Australia 2016 GPs 122 Titles 0 Best finish 5th Last season 10th. Endured a torrid build up, dropping their Russian title sponsor and driver Nikita Mazepin but Haas may yet emerge all the better for it. Having Kevin Magnussen back in the car is a boon and having written off last year in favour of developing the new ride appears to have paid off with no little pace in testing and Mick Schumacher very pleased with the results. Drivers Kevin Magnussen (Den, 29) No 20 Debut Australia 2014 Best race finish 2nd Poles 0 Best qualifying 4th Titles 0 Best season finish 9th Last season N/A (20th 2020). Just the fillip the team needed, Magnussen knows them well having raced for Haas from 2017-2020. He was dropped in favour of the Mazepin millions and went to race in sportscars last year but has jumped at the chance of another shot in F1. Brings experience, aggression and a singular determination not to give up, all qualities Haas will need. The back of the field is a livelier place for his return. Mick Schumacher (Ger, 23) No 47 Debut Bahrain 2021 Best race finish 12th Poles 0 Best qualifying 14th Titles 0 Best season finish 19th Last season 19th. Endured a tough rookie year in a woeful car well, getting his head down and displaying the famous Schumacher work ethic. Showed some pace but also admitted to making needless and often costly mistakes. With a more competitive car will face the real test against a teammate who is a known quantity and talented. Matching or beating Magnussen would be an impressive feat.",Sport/Sport,Formula One 2022: a team-by-team guide to the cars and drivers,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/17/formula-one-2022-team-by-team-guide-cars-drivers
3/17/2022,"The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, says improved economic conditions will allow the government to deliver a “targeted” cost of living package in this month’s budget, while gradually improving the budget bottom line. In the traditional pre-budget speech to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Friday, Frydenberg will set out how the 29 March budget will mark a return to normal budget settings as Australia emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic, warning that “crisis level” spending must stop. The Treasurer, who is facing calls to do more to ease cost of living pressures that are being exacerbated by rising fuel prices, will argue that the government needs to start pulling back on spending, or risk making inflationary pressures across the economy worse. “Crisis level economic support must not become entrenched,” Frydenberg will say in the speech on Friday. “With our tight labour market and our strong economic recovery, continued support at those levels would do more harm than good. It would risk putting further pressure on inflation, interest rates and cost of living.” Amid mixed views within the Coalition about the benefit of cutting the fuel excise and extending a low and middle income tax offset (LMITO), the treasurer will say that any support for families to address cost of living concerns would need to be limited. Frydenberg has previously indicated that extending the LMITO – which has an annual cost of about $7bn and would not be paid out until after the next financial year – could cause the Reserve Bank to revise its inflation forecasts upwards. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has indicated the government is conscious of the hip-pocket effect of rising fuel prices, and has left open the idea of cutting or freezing the fuel excise as John Howard did in 2001. Frydenberg said the economic recovery that was now under way would deliver a “fiscal dividend” to the budget which would allow the government to move to its second phase of fiscal repair while also addressing cost of living concerns. “In the budget in less than two weeks’ time, there will be further measures to support families to meet the cost of living pressures, in a targeted and proportionate way,” he says. He points to the full employment being “within sight”, December’s strong economic growth figures and private sector investment levels, as indicators of the country’s stronger than expected recovery. “It is this underlying strength and resilience of Australia’s economy that now enables us to transition to the second phase of our fiscal strategy,” Frydenberg says. “The time for large scale economy-wide emergency support is over (and) fiscal settings need to be normalised.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Under the second phase of the fiscal strategy, the government will begin to reign in spending and start to reduce budget deficits, while also starting to “stabilise and then reduce” debt as a share of the economy. Federal government gross debt has reached $866bn and is forecast to surpass $1tn by 2024-25. The amount of financial support provided throughout the Covid pandemic has totalled $314bn. Commonwealth outlays on the economy and health during the Covid pandemic amounted to more than 14% of gross domestic product. Saying the government can start to reduce debt as a percentage of GDP as a result of the improving budget circumstances, Frydenberg will emphasise the importance of a gradual winding back of support, so as not to threaten the economic recovery. “A sharp and sudden tightening in the fiscal settings would likely be counter-productive, undermining the economic recovery and ultimately hurting the budget.” “While Australians can be confident about their economic future and the underlying resilience of our economy, what recent years have shown, is that we live in very uncertain times. “The consistent lesson from these successful fiscal consolidations is that they are almost always achieved gradually and are underpinned by a strong economy and genuine fiscal discipline.” Provided that economic growth remained higher than the interest rate Australia paid on its debt, then the debt to GDP ratio would continue to fall, “even without running surpluses.” “A gradual and measured pace of consolidation ensures that the economy can continue to adjust and grow, even as fiscal policy normalises. “It’s about striking the right balance.” Frydenberg’s comments come as Thursday’s labour force statistics showed unemployment fell to 4% in February, down from 4.2% in January and its lowest level since 2008. Morrison incorrectly claimed it was the lowest level in 50 years. “The unemployment rate at 4% is the lowest rate that we’ve seen in almost 50 years. I was five years old when we last had an unemployment rate this low – and I think that says something,” Morrison said. The employment minister, Stuart Robert, later clarified, saying it was the “equal lowest”, and the “last time it was 4% was August 2008, February [2008] and [1974].” “That’s why I chose my words carefully to say it is the equal lowest rate – so the prime minister is absolutely correct,” Robert said. The unemployment was 4.01% in August 2008 and 3.98% in February 2008. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showed that 77,400 people joined the workforce in February, full-time employment grew by 121,900 jobs and part-time work fell by 44,500.",News/Business,Josh Frydenberg announces ‘targeted’ cost of living measures ahead of federal budget,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/17/josh-frydenberg-announces-targeted-cost-of-living-measures-ahead-of-federal-budget
