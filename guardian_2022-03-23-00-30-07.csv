3/23/2022,"Since its first episode in 2015, The Guilty Feminist podcast has explored topics such as periods, promiscuity and activism through a feminist lens, always recorded with a live audience. It was started by comedians Deborah Frances-White and Sofie Hagen, with guest co-hosts stepping in when Hagen departed. Tonight, we have actor Susan Wokoma, who’s long been an entertaining presence on the podcast. Our guest is Stranger Things and Enola Holmes star Millie Bobby Brown, while singer-songwriter Grace Petrie closes the show. The pros of a live podcast recording? The chance to feel part of a club, something The Guilty Feminist strives for by building in-jokes and promising the juiciest things you’re about to hear won’t make the final edit. We’re invited to share recent feminist triumphs and sing along to Petrie’s rousing anthems. The cons? It’s not just the juicy bits that will get cut – there’s plenty of slack in any podcast recording. Your experience is also dictated by how interesting you find the episode’s guest. There appear to be a lot of Brown’s fans in tonight. A large chunk of the show is given over to discussing her work and being a young woman in the public eye, and answering audience questions. She just turned 18 but has already produced a film and started a skincare brand alongside her acting work. She was only 12 when she decided she wanted to put the Enola Holmes books on screen (Wokoma jokes that she was busy picking scabs at that age). Until recently, Brown thought “feminist” was a bad word. Now, she’s fired up by her own experiences on male-dominated sets, being objectified by the media, and her Unicef work on girls’ education. The Q&A segment is standard celeb interview territory but humour is sprinkled throughout. Everyone shares an “I’m a feminist but …” line (the podcast’s signature), with Brown offering: “I’m a feminist but when I’m on my period I want the day off.” We get some light Boris-bashing, plus standup from the co-hosts. Wokoma is fun and charismatic, sharing memories of her own 18th birthday and 10 moments that made her feel like an adult, from buying cutlery in Poundland to suffering her first three-day hangover. Frances-White is lighter on laughs, but draws vocal agreement replaying an encounter with a sexist film exec and she is thoughtful on why we still need feminism – and the show’s well-tested format provides plenty for the entry-level feminist.

3/23/2022,"The number of UK households struggling with large debts increased by a third in 2021, even before the winter rise in energy prices and the removal of the £20 uplift in universal credit payments, research suggests. Analysis of Bank of England research carried out by the Jubilee Debt Campaign found in September 2021 almost 10% of households reported that loan and interest repayments were a heavy financial burden, a 35% increase on the previous year’s figures. Households also reported that their average monthly loan repayments reached a record £373 in 2021, up 22% on the year before and the highest figure for at least a decade. The campaign group’s analysis is based on a survey of more than 6,000 households which was carried out in September 2021. Since then, millions of households have seen energy bills rise and are due to see a further increase next month. The rise in Ofgem’s price cap in October, and the failure of a number of low-cost energy suppliers, led to some customers seeing bills increase by hundreds of pounds. On 1 April, a hike in the price cap means the average household is set to experience a 54% rise in bills. The temporary £20 a week increase in universal credit introduced at the start of the pandemic was phased out at the end of September. Surging food and petrol costs have added to the strain on finances since the research was done, and the Jubilee Debt Campaign said the rising cost of living threatened “to push people who are already living on the edge further into debt and poverty”. The increase in the number of households reporting that their debts were a heavy financial burden followed two years of falls, but the campaign group said it suggested that measures to ease the impact of the pandemic had not helped everyone. The data for loan repayments comes from analysis of households’ reports of repayments on unsecured debt, so does not include mortgages. It showed that in nominal terms and when inflation was adjusted for, these were running higher than over the past decade. Separate research carried out last week showed families are already concerned about falling into debt as a result of higher living costs. Citizens Advice said 5 million people had indicated that they would not be able to afford April’s energy price rises, while in a survey by the Money Advice Trust one in five adults said they were likely to borrow or use credit in the next three months to cover essentials. Dean Burn, 62, is involved with the Jubilee Debt Campaign in Manchester and worked for 41 years before losing his job during the Covid pandemic. He said: “I’m always juggling debts – this month I got my TV licence bill, so I’ve been unable to pay back my housing benefit over-payment. “I’ve relied on food banks these past 12 months to get by and I can’t afford to even pay for the bus sometimes. I’ve been keeping just one light on in the house at a time and I’m now worried about being able to afford to heat my home.” Joe Cox, the senior policy officer at Jubilee Debt Campaign, said Rishi Sunak needed to announce a serious plan to address the situation when he delivers the spring statement on Wednesday. He said: “The worsening debt crisis is toppling households up and down the country … The government should target support to help those struggling with rising bills and mounting arrears and provide a ‘fair debt writedown’ to give people with high levels of debt a fresh start.” Cox added: “We also need to see significant policies to deliver rising incomes and a decent universal minimum income floor to prevent these chronic debt crises from happening again.” Citizens Advice said it had analysed the impact of the removal £20 universal credit uplift on clients using its services, and found that in more than a quarter of cases where an adviser referred someone to a food bank that was given as the reason.",Lifestyle/Money,Number of UK households with large debts rises by a third,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/22/uk-households-debts-energy-prices-benefits
3/23/2022,"RAF gunner Corrie McKeague, who vanished on a night out in 2016, died after getting into a bin which was then tipped into a waste lorry, an inquest has concluded. The airman, of Dunfermline, Fife, was 23 when he disappeared in the early hours of 24 September in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. He was last seen on CCTV at 3.25am entering a service area behind a Greggs shop. His body has never been found, despite extensive searches. On Tuesday, an inquest jury recorded in a narrative conclusion that McKeague died at approximately 4.20am in Bury St Edmunds as a result of “compression asphyxia in association with multiple injuries”, jurors recorded. In their conclusion, they said McKeague’s “death was contributed to by impaired judgment due to alcohol consumption”. They said there were “ineffective bin locks”, an “ineffective search of the bin” before it was tipped, and “poor visibility through a Perspex viewing window on the lorry”. His father, Martin McKeague, said after the ruling that he hopes his son can “finally be left to rest in peace”, with the inquest shining “a new light on the truth for everyone”. At the time of his disappearance, McKeague was based at RAF Honington, in Suffolk, about 10 miles from Bury St Edmunds. He had trained at the base in 2013 and remained when he joined the parachute trained II Squadron RAF Regiment. Family have said he loved his time with the service, which had seen him travel to Africa and France and sail a 21-metre (69ft) yacht to Brazil. He relished the camaraderie of military life and had made “very close friends”. On Friday 23 September, McKeague’s friends at the base decided to go out in Bury St Edmunds. McKeague drove into the town. He had been drinking in his on-base flat before he left and was likely to have been over the legal drink-driving limit. During the inquest, his father told jurors he believed his son had developed a significant binge-drinking problem at the age of 15 after he was the first to find the body of a close friend who had just been killed on a train line. While he was prescribed antidepressants in the past, his mother Nicola Urquhart told the inquest he was “back to his usual happy self” by 2015. McKeague ended up in a nightclub called Flex. After midnight, he was asked to leave by the bouncer, Will Hook, who decided McKeague was too drunk to stay any longer – though Hook has previously said McKeague was not misbehaving. He wandered off to Pizza Mama Mia on St Andrew’s Street North. After finishing his food, at about 1.20am, he leant up against the door of Hughes electrical store, on Brentgovel Street, slid to the ground and fell asleep. After a couple of hours, he awoke, stood up and a little dazed walked into a loading and refuse collection area – known as “the Horseshoe” – behind, among other shops, a Greggs bakery. It was about 3.25am in the early hours of Saturday 24 September. By midday on Monday 26 September, McKeague hadn’t turned up for a parade at work. When he couldn’t be found on the base, he was reported missing to police. After tracing his movements using CCTV to the Horseshoe behind Greggs, the police identified four vehicles that went into the loading area, including a bin lorry, a delivery vehicle and a vehicle owned by an employee of one of the adjoining shops. A total of 31 people of interest near the area were identified, including the owners or drivers of all the vehicles. A key piece of evidence suggested McKeague was in the bin lorry. His mobile phone signal was traced until it ran out at 4.25am near Barton Mills, about 14 miles north-west of Bury St Edmunds, after crucially following the route of the truck. And there was anecdotal evidence that he had done something similar before. His best friend Paul Robb, who served with him in the RAF, told the inquest McKeague slept under bin bags after a night out in Lichfield, Staffordshire, in 2014. In his witness statement, Robb said: “Corrie had always been extreme with his drinking and there were no half measures with Corrie.”",News/UK news,"Corrie McKeague died after getting into a bin on a night out, inquest finds",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/22/corrie-mckeague-died-after-getting-into-a-bin-on-a-night-out-inquest-finds
3/23/2022,"Ketanji Brown Jackson gave a passionate defense of her sentencing of child sexual abuse imagery offenders as a rebuttal to attacks from a Republican senator who has accused her of endangering children, as her confirmation hearings for a seat on the US supreme court entered a critical second day. At the start of an epic day of questioning before the Senate judiciary committee on Capitol Hill, Jackson strongly refuted claims made by Josh Hawley, Republican senator from Missouri. The senator has spent several days advancing the theory that the Biden nominee, in her eight years as a federal district court judge, handed down sentences that were far more lenient than federal guidelines suggested or prosecutors requested. Hawley’s accusations have been debunked as misleading and false. On Tuesday, Jackson gave a personal response to the claims. “As a mother and a judge who has had to deal with these cases, nothing could be further from the truth,” Jackson said under questioning from Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic committee chair. She said child abuse cases were among the most difficult she dealt with as a judge, and described child sexual abuse imagery as a “sickening and egregious crime”. She said she imposed “significant sentences” and emphasized that she always told offenders the consequences of their crimes by reading them victims’ statements. “I describe at almost every one of these sentencings how someone has written to me who has developed agrophobia. She cannot leave the house because her pictures are on the internet, they are out there forever.” On the second day of hearings, each committee member was given 30 minutes to engage with Jackson. On Wednesday, they will get 20 minutes for follow-up questions. The final decision on confirmation will be made in a vote of the full Senate that is likely to be held by the first week in April. After a relatively amicable opening day, Jackson was facing up to 12 hours on Tuesday of possibly grueling interrogation from the 22-member committee, half of which is Republican. If confirmed, Joe Biden’s nominee would become the first Black woman to sit on the nation’s highest court in its more than two centuries of existence. The child sexual abuse imagery attack is likely to be the most toxic accusation Jackson faces in her four days of hearings. Politico revealed that Republican members of the committee were circulating a document on the subject that suggested a co-ordinated strategy. At Durbin’s invitation, Jackson also defended herself against the Republican attack line that she was soft in her legal approach to terrorist suspects held at the Guantánamo Bay military camp in Cuba. Jackson spent two years as a federal public defender and in that role represented some of the detainees in their bid for review of their cases. Jackson pointed out that her brother, Ketajh Brown, joined the US military in the wake of the terrorist attacks on 9/11. But she went on to say that American justice required all defendants to be represented and treated fairly. “That’s what makes our system the best in the world, that’s what makes us exemplars,” she said. Chuck Grassley, the ranking member, opened questions for the Republicans. He asked if Jackson would uphold the second amendment right to bear arms. “The supreme court has established that the right to bear arms is a fundamental right,” she replied. Jackson also gave her response to another bugbear of the Republican senators: progressive proposals to dilute conservative dominance of the court by expanding its size. Joe Biden’s first nominee followed the example of Amy Coney Barrett, the third justice appointed to the court by Donald Trump, in declining to be drawn in. “My north star is the consideration of the proper role of a judge, and in my view judges should not be speaking on political issues,” she said. “Certainly not a nominee to the supreme court.” Later, she added: “I am committed to staying in my lane.” If you or someone you know has been abused, in the US call or text the Childhelp abuse hotline on 800-422-4453.

3/23/2022,"Jimmy Kimmel opened Monday’s show with the opening day of confirmation hearings for Ketanji Brown Jackson, Joe Biden’s nominee for the supreme court. “These hearings, they give a number of our Republican senators the chance to compete in one of their favorite events: the subtle racism jamboree,” said Kimmel. Judge Jackson would be the first black woman confirmed to the court, and her path appears to be clear, as Vice-President Kamala Harris would cast the tie-breaking vote should the confirmation go along party lines, 50-50. “That would be the GOP’s ultimate nightmare: having this decided by two black women whose names they can’t pronounce,” Kimmel joked. In other news, “all the characters from Trumpsylvania were out this weekend,” Kimmel said, including Rudy Giuliani, AKA “recount Dracula”, who appeared on a Newsmax show called Wise Guys. “I don’t know what this show is, but I for one enjoy any show where the people being interviewed are also eating clams,” said Kimmel of the rightwing program, in which Newsmax hosts interviewed Giuliani at a diner table. “What a show – just Rudy having a perfectly normal meeting at an Olive Garden with three Dick Tracy villains, nothing to see.” And according to a Yahoo poll, Trump leads Biden by 43 points among unvaccinated voters, “who might not even make it to the election”, said Kimmel. “Trump loves the poorly vaccinated, and they’re not the only group that is solidly pro-Trump. He’s also a solid favorite among firework stand operators, iguana breeders, disgraced mall Santas, manufacturers of husky golf pants, and former crackhead pillow salesman.” On the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon celebrated the first weekend of March Madness and this year’s Cinderella team, the 15-seed St Peter’s Peacocks, who upset No 2-seed Kentucky. “It’s exciting for longtime fans who have been following the team since Thursday,” Fallon joked. St Peter’s is the first team from New Jersey to make the sweet sixteen in more than 20 years. “And if they go all the way they’ll be the only team to wear their championship rings on their pinkies,” said Fallon, imitating a mob figure. Fallon also touched on the Senate confirmation hearing for Ketanji Brown Jackson, which will last four days. “It’s basically CSPAN’s version of Coachella,” he quipped. “Jackson will face days of tough questions. Brett Kavanaugh was like ‘it’ll be fine, I did it for four days,” Fallon mocked, slurring his words. “After the second day, it’s kinda a blur. It’s fine, you’re kinda my best friend.” And finally, the dating company Match has launched a new dating app for parents called Stir. “Their slogan is ‘I’ll join your hell if you join mine,’” Fallon joked.",Arts/Culture,Jimmy Kimmel on Ketanji Brown Jackson’s hearing: ‘The subtle racism jamboree’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/22/jimmy-kimmel-ketanji-brown-jackson-confirmation-hearing-racism-jamboree
3/23/2022,"On the first day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, while doomscrolling on social media, I noticed a Facebook post by a Russian friend of mine in Moscow, expressing the hope that “all the fascists will be exterminated in my homeland”. She was referring to Vladimir Putin’s claim that Russia’s “special military operation” aimed to “denazify” Ukraine. I was stunned that this was her take on the Ukraine war. We had been friends for more than 30 years, and during my time as a foreign correspondent in Moscow in the Soviet era, she had been my sounding board and guide. I remember the evenings spent with her and her husband, quaffing Soviet champagne and mocking the nightly TV news, Vremya, with its state-controlled version of events. How could she now be so uncritical of Putin’s state-run media? Like most of the Russians I knew in the Gorbachev years, she was western-leaning – although she never visited my flat in a guarded compound for fear of being considered a dissident for associating with foreigners. When I went to their home in the outer Moscow suburbs, I would either take the metro and then a roundabout route to their building, or park my car several streets away and hope that I hadn’t been followed. In those days, the KGB was ever-present, and ready to intimidate journalists with low-level harassment. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, my friend took advantage of the novelty of foreign travel. Staring at her Facebook post, I was reminded of a trip she’d made to Paris with her sister in 2014. Over steak and chips in a cafe in Les Halles, we had a heated argument about the Russian annexation of Crimea. We both got upset. She accused me of being brainwashed by the Americans and I couldn’t understand how she’d been brainwashed by Putin, who had already systematically shut down opposition parties and the majority of independent media in Russia. I’d covered the aftermath of the killing of former spy Alexander Litvinenko with a highly radioactive isotope in central London in 2006, and was only too aware of how far Putin was prepared to go. Since our last meeting in Paris, our exchanges had dwindled to Christmas messages and the occasional phone call in which we steered clear of politics. So I wondered whether to challenge my friend over her Facebook post about Ukraine. I considered sending video links of captured Russian soldiers who said they’d been deceived and had no idea they were on a mission to kill their fellow Slavs. But I feared a repeat of our 2014 slanging match. What was the point? It would be like trying to argue with a Trump supporter with each of us attacking the other for “fake news”. So I did nothing. Then last week, she posted again on Facebook, asking, “Why is the west so tolerant of fascists?” This time I unfriended her. I’m saddened by the sudden end of our long friendship, but I realise I’m not alone. The war in Ukraine has torn Russian families apart. Another friend from Moscow, now living in America, told me that she’d fallen out with her next-door neighbour, who comes from the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. The neighbour accuses the Ukrainian “bandits” of the neo-Nazi Azov battalion of bombing the maternity hospital in Mariupol, which was in fact hit in a Russian strike. She believes that the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is a drug addict, that the US has more than 28 biological weapon labs in Ukraine that may also have been responsible for the spread of Covid. When I asked how anyone living in America could hold such views, my friend replied that there is plenty of Russian propaganda on YouTube and Facebook and of course on Russian TV, which is available in the US. The images of the deliberate targeting of civilians by Russian forces, as broadcast by the US TV networks, is dismissed by her neighbour as “fake news”. In the west, we understand that this is Putin’s war, decided by a despot and a tiny band of yes men. But the longer the conflict persists, the more the faultlines will deepen between us and ordinary Russians who have bought into the official lie. I fear that in this era of fake news put out by governments – including our own – in which rational argument is no longer possible, many of us will take refuge inside our echo chambers. But our lives will be undoubtedly the poorer. I feel like a coward for pulling the plug without explanation on more than 30 years of friendship, but in my own small way I also feel that I had to take a stand in Putin’s propaganda war.

3/23/2022,"This animated feature is written and directed by Philip Gelatt, who previously made live-action horror pics They Remain and The Bleeding House, and Morgan Galen King; it is an American-made production but one indebted to the style and scope of classic Japanese anime, what with its fusion of 18-certificate worthy violence, steampunk fantasy elements and new age spiritualism. That all makes for a heady, fizzy mix that’s very watchable, probably even more so for viewers open to the use of chemical assistance. Still, there are passages where the narrative throughline gets rather muddled and you can only wonder where those characters with mechanical wings and plague doctor masks suddenly came from (or did you just fall asleep for a minute and imagine them?) It’s best not to think too hard about it and just let the striking imagery and saturated colours wash over your retinas. The Spine of Night is set in a world that seems to be going through an historical period roughly analogous to our late medieval/early Renaissance era of colonialism and discovery, when better armed conquistadors with better weapons and fewer scruples conquer the native occupants of a swampy land. However, the indigenous people, who go about mostly naked all the time, have magical blue flower power, in the literal shape of a botanical tech that shamanistic priestess Tzod (voiced by Lucy Lawless) can control with her mind and do cool stuff with, like making lethal blue flames. But evil scholar Ghal-Sur (Jordan Douglas Smith) steals the blue flower from Tzod and wreaks havoc before someone else subjugates him. The whole saga is being recounted by Tzod to a figure called the Guardian (Richard E Grant) on top of a snowy mountain, which adds a not entirely necessary but decorative layer of meta on the top. The expressiveness of the animation, especially on Tzod, is well observed, but the film as a whole can’t get away from that characteristically unsettling anime-style disconnect between the simplicity of the figures and the rich detail of the landscape.

3/23/2022,"At the beginning of a bright new season in January, during a post-match press conference in Melbourne, Simona Halep was charged with assessing all the essential coaching decisions she had made over the years on the way to becoming a champion.“I was lucky because I found the right people almost all the time,” she said, shrugging. “It was not that difficult, let’s say. I just went with my feeling, with what I felt, so what I felt, I did. I think I took the best decisions for my career.” Halep discussed the subject of coaching with more confidence than any other player interviewed, yet within weeks her team had splintered. In February, five months after a surprise split from her longtime coach Darren Cahill, Halep announced the dissolution of her partnership with the Romanians Daniel Dobre and Adrian Marcu. She said she would play on without a coach for her personal growth and to “see how much I can do on my own”. Not so much, it turns out. In Indian Wells last week, Halep had already executed a sharp U-turn, hiring new faces for her team. After only two tournaments, she said she realised just how hard it is to train, travel and play matches without a coach. Even an extremely successful 30-year-old player with 16 years’ experience under her belt is still figuring things out each day. In most prominent sports, primarily team sports, the coaches have significant power and they control much of an athlete’s career. Many other individual athletes, meanwhile, are dictated by national federations. Then there is tennis, where the athlete is simultaneously the employer and the business itself, hiring people around them then going on to the court to perform alone. “When I spoke with athletes from other sports, they’re shocked,” says Daria Kasatkina, a former Top 10 player, laughing. “They’re like: ‘Wow, how do you do this?” Having so much autonomy over their careers comes with many obstacles. A common theme is the strange power dynamic of employing people, often much older than them, to instruct and criticise them. “You have to find resources to maintain your team and to be your own little company,” says Garbiñe Muguruza. “I felt the hardest was to hire people to tell you what to do, to be humble, to say: ‘If I look for the best team, the best coach, I have to listen to what they say.’ Even if I am the owner of this boat, I hire a captain that is going to guide it.” As tennis has professionalised over the years, players’ support casts have grown dramatically. It is now not uncommon for them to travel with multiple coaches, physios, fitness coaches, agents and even psychologists. Milos Raonic once referred to himself as the “CEO of Milos Raonic tennis” after employing a third coach. “I guess to some extent it would be much easier if someone told me where I have to play, where I have to be, if I didn’t have to think about it too much,” Raonic says. “I’m constantly trying to figure out the way I can give myself the best chance to play healthy, play week-in and week-out.” Towards the end of last year, coaching decisions became a large talking point after Emma Raducanu chose not to extend her partnership with Andrew Richardson, her temporary coach during her remarkable run to the US Open title. It led to some criticism of Raducanu as she eventually chose to hire Torben Beltz permanently. But for some players those teenage years are unavoidably brutal. Tennis players spend their youth preparing their game and bodies, yet many feel they are left to learn about how to deal with the enormous responsibilities as they go along. Despite all his success, Andy Murray speaks with disdain about his experiences as an employer: “I don’t like it, personally,” he says. “I’ve found it difficult. It’s something that, as an 18-, 19-, 20-year-old, you have zero experience of how to deal with those situations.” According to Roger Federer, the act of giving out salaries at such a young age is strange in itself. “It’s awkward at the beginning. Being young, paying salaries, it’s not very usual. That’s why I enjoyed the time I had support from the federation and I didn’t have to worry about these things,” Federer told me in 2018. Murray argues that players should be able to receive some help with making major career decisions early on in their career. “It just feels a bit odd, employing people at 19 years old that are 20, 25 years older than you, that have way more experience and way more knowledge than you,” he says. “It doesn’t feel like that’s how it should be. It feels like it should be the other way round or that there should be someone – a performance manager, or whatever – to help take the onus off the individual.” With this unusual dynamic come relationships that must be maintained yet are not always easy to. “Maybe now you’re paying the salary [you think]: ‘I don’t like it, I’m going to get rid of him,’” said Federer. “But it’s just so wrong and I was lucky I never thought that way or felt that way. I always looked at it as, well, they’re older, they’re more experienced, they know what they’re talking about.” Naomi Osaka concurs: “I feel like it’s really important that we all communicate regularly because we want to make sure we’re on the same path, we kind of see the same goals,” she says. With it being all too easy for players to blame others, exert their power and make emotional decisions when things aren’t initially going well, patience is required. “You have to be really patient,” says Kasatkina. “But it’s tough because we have tournament by tournament, points here, points there. You defend something here, you lose something there. Everything is so fast and you also want everything fast.” Over the past year, Murray has been caught up in the coaching carousel as he split with his longtime coach Jamie Delgado, then underwent multiple trial periods before rehiring Ivan Lendl. “Something I have struggled with over the years, really, [is] communicating how I feel about certain situations and then being worried about whoever the person is who you’re working with, how they’re going to take that and how they’re going to respond to that,” says Murray. Such miscommunications only lead to perhaps the most dreaded aspect: firings. Some coaching splits can be seamless, as evidenced by Félix Auger-Aliassime, who describes his parting with his long-term coach Guillaume Marx in 2020 as “probably one of the toughest decisions I’ve made in my young life”. Since then, however, he has grown and reached the Top 10 A classic example of the drama that can follow occurred at the US Open in 2019 when a 21-year-old Aryna Sabalenka announced a split with her coach Dmitry Tursunov after losing in singles. A few days later, she penned a dramatic letter on Instagram imploring him to return. By the end of the week he stood by her as she lifted the US Open women’s doubles trophy. They split a few months later. “I also had some bad experiences earlier in my career when I finished with coaches,” says Murray. “I would try to have conversations with coaches and it didn’t go well. When you’re 18, 19 that can influence how you go about those situations later in life when those experiences potentially have not gone well and it’s been a bit messy.” The subject of splitting simply brings Kasatkina to laughter: “It’s like breaking up with a boyfriend or girlfriend. It’s pretty tough. Sometimes he doesn’t expect or you don’t expect [it]. Most of the time players finish their cooperation, but sometimes also the coaches don’t want to continue to work. Most of the time it’s not finishing on a good note.” All of these complications don’t even begin to address the unique obstacles involved for women’s players, with so many employing male coaches and team members. “There are very different dynamics and especially being a female that’s in charge of a team and boys on a team and most of the time a female that is younger than most of the team,” Maria Sharapova told me in 2018. “For the girls it’s tough to go to the man and say ‘you’re fired’,” says Kasatkina, laughing. “It’s really tough. But sometimes you have to work out how to do it. Of course, it’s best to finish your cooperation as, maybe not friends, but on good [terms]. You can’t always do this unfortunately.” Kasatkina, 24, has already been a professional player for eight years. Born in Russia, her career ambitions led her to move to Slovakia alone at 17 and she now resides in Spain.

3/23/2022,"The number of children in state schools in England who were absent last week because of Covid has more than tripled in a fortnight, confirming headteachers’ warnings of growing disruption in classrooms as pupils prepare for summer exams. Figures published by the Department for Education (DfE) on Tuesday showed 202,000 pupils were off school on 17 March because of the virus – a dramatic jump from 58,000 two weeks earlier when attendance was described as returning to “something approaching normal”. According to the latest government data, 159,000 pupils were off with a confirmed case of the Covid last week, up from 45,000 on 3 March, with a further 16,000 pupils absent with a suspected case of coronavirus, up from 6,000 earlier in the month. Overall, attendance in state schools in England dropped from 92.2% two weeks ago to 89.7%, with Covid related absence up from 0.7% to 2.5%. The government would like to see attendance in schools return to pre-pandemic levels of about 95%. The latest figures also show rising absence among staff with almost one in 10 teachers and schools leaders (9.1%) off on 17 March, up from 5.8% two weeks earlier. About 48,000 teachers and 60,000 teaching assistants were absent last week, with schools struggling to secure supply cover for those missing. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers said: “These figures are absolutely in line with what we have been hearing from our members. Covid cases have been spiking again in many schools over the past week or so – in line with the rising numbers nationally. “The government urgently needs to remind people that just because the legal requirement to isolate has been removed, there is still a duty to take appropriate action to reduce the spread of Covid – just like any other illness.” Whiteman also described plans to remove free access to lateral flow tests from the start of next month amid rising cases as irresponsible. “The government cannot just let Covid rip through schools. Covid hasn’t gone away and we need a proper plan for how to live with it long-term that is focused on keeping levels low and reducing disruption.” A key concern is pupils preparing for GCSEs and A-levels this summer. “Many schools are still finishing teaching the specifications as there has been so much disruption over the two years of exam courses,” said Whiteman. “More disruption now could be seriously damaging to pupils’ exam chances and education recovery.” The DfE has been approached for comment.",News/World news,Covid absences in schools in England triple in two weeks,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/covid-absences-schools-england-triple-in-two-weeks
3/23/2022,"It has been three weeks since Russia updated the official death toll to its invasion in Ukraine, leaving open the question of how many of its soldiers have been killed or wounded in the chaotic opening stages of its war. In early March, the Russian defence ministry admitted that 498 Russian soldiers had been killed in action and 1,500 wounded, a large number after just 10 days of fighting that pointed to the danger of its attempts to take Kyiv in a lightning raid. Critics said the official government numbers should be treated with scepticism. And US and Ukrainian officials have since claimed that Russia has suffered 10, 20 or 30 times as many casualties, claiming that Russian losses could rival the wars in Chechnya or Afghanistan. And amid an information vacuum in Russia, rumours have spread over the hundreds, or thousands more, who have been killed in the ensuing weeks. “It’s almost a state secret,” said a Russian military commentator who asked not to be quoted by name to discuss the issue. “We don’t know exactly [how many people have died] … at the given moment, it’s better to discuss other questions.” Russian news outlets continuing to operate inside the country have largely stopped reporting on the death toll from the war, as censors have forbidden any discussion that calls the conflict a “war” or “invasion”. But on Monday, the Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda, which frequently posts pro-Kremlin news reports, published a bombshell buried deep in a news story about the war: “According to Russian defence ministry data … 9,861 Russian soldiers had been killed in action and another 16,153 had been wounded.” Just minutes later, the line was gone. No other Russian news agencies reported the remarks, and it was not clear why Komsomolskaya Pravda alone would have access to that information. Screenshots and archived versions of the deleted report quickly went viral, as critics pointed to the article as evidence that the Kremlin was suffering catastrophic losses in the month-old war. The paper later claimed that its site had been hacked. “Access to the administrative interface was hacked on the Komsomolskaya Pravda website and a fake was made in this publication about the situation around the special operation in Ukraine,” the website wrote. “The false information was immediately deleted.” With little official information, journalists have had to sift through local funeral announcements or search out morgue directors for clues as to the Russian death toll, while officials have accused anyone covering the topic of disinformation. “The collective west is trying to divide our society,” Vladimir Putin said in a speech late last week. “Speculating on military losses, the socio-economic consequences of sanctions, to provoke a civil rebellion in Russia. And is using its fifth column in order to achieve this goal … the destruction of Russia.” BBC Russian on Monday published a report that said it had confirmed the deaths of 557 soldiers. That report was based on soldiers whom it could confirm by first and last name had been killed in the fighting. It remains the most authoritative account of the Russian death toll from the war. Earlier this week, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the US state-funded news agency with dozens of journalists in the region, reported that Belarusian hospitals had been filled with Russian war dead after weeks of war. It quoted one employee of the Homel regional clinical hospital, who said that more than 2,500 soldiers’ corpses had been shipped from the Belarusian region back to Russia as of 13 March. But it could not independently confirm that account. Other estimates are far higher. US intelligence officials this week gave a “conservative” estimate that more than 7,000 Russian soldiers had been killed in fighting in Ukraine since late February, a number that would exceed the official death toll among Russian servicemen for the two years of the first Chechen war, which is remembered as a particularly brutal and haphazard campaign. And Ukrainian officials on Monday evening estimated that more than 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, a number around the official estimates of Soviet soldiers killed in the decade-long war in Afghanistan. That war marked a considerable decline in the prestige of the Soviet military abroad and the pullout came just months before the fall of the Soviet Union. Analysts have warned about taking that information at face value during a war where western countries want to emphasise the toll of the war on the Russian military while the Kremlin wants to downplay its losses. In its edited story, Komsomolskaya Pravda also deleted a line saying that the Russian Ministry of Defence has denied Ukrainian reports of “supposedly massive” losses of the Russian military in Ukraine. It is a particularly perilous moment to report on the topic, as Russia threatens all publications who release information about the war. Several military analysts and NGOs declined to comment on the Komsomolskaya Pravda story because of concerns about a legal backlash and possible punishment for discussing unofficial numbers. But there are indications, including from open sources, that Russia is sustaining heavy losses during the fighting. The Oryx Blog, an open-source site that tracks military-equipment losses, has reported that Russia has lost 1,666 vehicles in Ukraine, of which more than 800 have been destroyed during the conflict. Those confirmed destroyed include 111 tanks, 74 armoured fighting vehicles, 123 infantry fighting vehicles, and 312 trucks, vehicles and jeeps. “This list only includes destroyed vehicles and equipment of which photo or videographic evidence is available,” the bloggers wrote. “Therefore, the amount of equipment destroyed is significantly higher than recorded here.”",News/World news,How many Russian soldiers have died in the war in Ukraine?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/how-many-russian-soldiers-died-ukraine-losses
3/23/2022,"Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has struck a deal with a political rival that would keep in him power until 2025. In exchange for support from the New Democratic party on key votes, Trudeau’s Liberals have pledged progress on national pharmaceutical and dental care programs. “With so much instability around us, Canadians need stability,” said the prime minister as he announced the deal with the NDP on Tuesday morning. Trudeau said “nobody benefits” when parliament “doesn’t work properly”, and that his Liberals would look for common goals with the NDP and other opposition parties. Trudeau was elected to a third term in September, but commands only a minority of seats in parliament, meaning he requires the support of other parties to govern. Minority governments have a relatively short lifespan and governing parties attempt to legislate with the ever-present fear of a looming election. Under a confidence and supply agreement, an opposition party agrees to not vote to defeat the government for a period of time. With Tuesday’s announcement, the NDP leader, Jagmeet Singh, and his party will support Trudeau’s government on confidence votes like the federal budget. The leftwing NDP has backed Trudeau’s Liberals in key votes since 2019. Singh’s party underperformed expectations in the previous election, adding only one seat. While no New Democrats will be given cabinet seats, the agreement gives the party, which placed fourth in the election, outsized influence in shaping federal policy. In addition to pushing pharmacare and dental care for low-income Canadians, Trudeau said his government will tax banks whose profits surged during the pandemic. He also said Indigenous rights and climate change remained priorities. The deal was sharply criticized by the interim Conservative leader, Candice Bergen, who called the agreement “a callous attempt by Trudeau to hold on to power”. “This is an NDP-Liberal attempt at government by blackmail. Nation-building is replaced by vote-buying; secret deal-making over parliamentary debate; and opportunism over accountability,” Bergen said in statement late on Monday evening after media reports of an impending deal. “If this NDP-Liberal coalition stands, Canada is in for a very rough ride.” While parties often support each other during minority governments, formal confidence and supply agreements are relatively rare in federal politics. At the provincial and territorial level, three governments have entered into similar agreements since 2017. The most prominent deal, between the British Columbia NDP government and the Green party, lasted three years.",News/World news,Justin Trudeau strikes power-sharing deal with leftwing New Democrats,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/justin-trudeau-power-sharing-deal-new-democrats
3/23/2022,"Energy companies are using unfair and potentially illegal tactics to secure cash at the expense of their customers amid the energy crisis, the consumer expert Martin Lewis has told MPs. Households face a “fiscal punch in the face” in April when energy bills under the government’s price cap rise, Lewis said, a day before the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, makes his spring statement, in which he is expected to announce measures to respond to the cost of living crisis. Rising energy prices have played a central role in squeezing households’ finances, risking the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has caused oil prices to soar, is likely to add further costs for UK consumers when the price cap incorporates higher wholesale prices. Speaking to MPs on parliament’s business select committee, Lewis listed a litany of problems faced by consumers as many energy companies try to stay afloat. They ranged from people being owed credit by energy companies but not getting it, to energy companies misleading customers into switching to more expensive tariffs and raising customers’ direct debits disproportionately to the rate of the increased bills. Lewis, who runs the influential Money Saving Expert website and is Britain’s best-known consumer advocate, said the increases in direct debits may represent breaches of energy companies’ licence conditions. “A number of companies are doing it to improve their own cashflow position at the expense of their customers,” Lewis said. The typical household energy bill will increase by about £1,300 over the course of a year if high wholesale prices are sustained. The government has so far announced a £150 council tax cut and a repayable £200 discount to spread the cost of energy price rises over future years. “That is clearly not enough,” said Lewis. “We need to pump more money into the system or we need a vulnerable-user price cap.” Asked what the government should do to help struggling households, Lewis said: “It needs to give them more money. It’s as simple as that.” Energy bills do not vary widely between poorer and wealthier households, so price rises hit poorer families disproportionately. Lewis described energy prices as “almost a poll tax”, a reference to a flat-rate tax on every adult. In the UK a poll tax – the community charge – played an important part in the resignation of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister, and Conservative MPs are fearful that the current crisis could threaten the party’s popularity. Gillian Cooper, head of energy policy at Citizens Advice, said the government’s help was “insufficient to cope with the scale of the problem we’re facing”, speaking to MPs at the hearing. Data published by the charity last week suggest that 5 million people in the UK will be unable to afford their energy bills in April when the price cap increases. That could jump to 14.5 million in October, based on further wholesale energy price rises that will be incorporated into the price cap. Cooper said the most effective way to help people would probably be via the benefits system in the form of a grant, although she added that all benefits should be uprated in line with surging inflation. Benefits will rise by 3.1%, based on consumer prices index inflation in September, well below the 5.5% inflation seen in January.",News/Business,"Energy firms using sharp practices to boost cashflow, says Martin Lewis ",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/22/energy-firms-using-sharp-practices-to-boost-cashflow-says-martin-lewis
3/23/2022,"To Britain, where a woman who hasn’t said a word for six years is apparently talking too much. Are you a man who’s got a massive view about how a hostage should behave after a lengthy incarceration? Are you 90% throbbing forehead vein? Do you like your prison victims pliant, and super-obsequious about having spent pretty much their young daughter’s entire life as the cell guest of a theocracy? If so, we really, really want to hear from you! And I have a feeling we’re going to! Can you possibly stow your two-litre caramel latte in the cup holder, handbrake turn on to the hard shoulder, punch in the phone-in digits, and then give a masterclass in how unthreatened you are by the decadent western spectacle of a woman speaking her mind. Encouragingly, because some British people like to put their mouth where their arse is, the above call to arms has been answered. By mid-morning today, #sendherback was trending on Twitter (further bolstered by those so horrified by the hashtag they felt the need to repeat it). Down the phone lines and across the internets, many people are simply not happy with Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s failure to react to her belated release like she’s just won Miss World in 1957. You know the playbook: deeply indebted tears at a flow volume that won’t disrupt the mascara; silence broken only by a pledge to work with children and animals. British children and British animals, just to be on the safe side. And yet, having spent a lot of time at her press conference yesterday thanking a large number of individuals and organisations who played a part in her eventual release, Nazanin did mention the fact it took just the five successive foreign secretaries before something repeatedly promised to her actually happened. And it is this that seems to have caused a huge number of four-wheel-drive prams to be emptied of all toys. Of course, you get a few wishy-washy ignoramuses disagreeing. “If trying our best took six years,” reasoned Jeremy Hunt, “then we must be honest and say the problem should have been solved earlier.” Sorry, Jeremy, but what on earth do you know about the situation?! Wait. Hang on – my producer’s telling me Jeremy was literally one of those five foreign secretaries. OK … well … thanks for dialling in. But we’ll have to cut you off now because I’ve got a 56-year-old man from Aldershot on the line, who once told a BT customer service representative that she was as bad as Hitler, and is now marvelling at the absolute cheek of Nazanin. I’ve got a guy who thinks masks were fascism strongly suspecting the ayatollah had a point about this bird. I’m kidding, of course. But one does sometimes wonder if this whole generational cohort is becoming coddled. Nobody tells them to shut up and buck up. Nobody tells them to get some perspective and ring off. It’s just possible we’re raising a generation of entitled middle-aged men who think their every needy opinion has to be listened to. As far as genuine real-life examples go, I saw one individual who characterised Nazanin’s wry difference of opinion with Richard Ratcliffe about the merits of the Foreign Office response as “disrespect[ing] her husband”. Over on Nick Ferrari’s show on LBC, a chap called Jason seemed outraged that Nazanin “didn’t come across as a sort of victim”, adding “it would have been nice for her to say thank you”. (She did, at length – but perhaps it was too much for Jason to actually watch the thing.) Ferrari appeared to partially agree, remarking: “There might have been a degree more gratitude.” Aha! There it is. Gratitude. I’m never sure whether it means “being thankful” or “not being uppity”. However, I can tell you it heralds some important Venn diagram news: the people sticking it to Nazanin for not being “grateful” enough are the same people who boo footballers for taking the knee. Yup, just like the old knee-taking, it all comes down to gratitude – the UK’s sole remaining virtue after the others were sold off to oligarchs and Middle East sovereign wealth funds. And you know, I hugely admire people who have whittled down their entire emotional range to a single, extremely compact sentiment: the idea that people should be grateful. Other people, obviously – not them. After all, how can they be grateful when there are ungrateful people out there? Stands to reason. They’re so ungrateful about a world that contains ingratitude that they have to ring a phone-in and lose their shit about it. Look what you made them do. Indeed, this whole line of criticism reminds me of a particular genre of Daily Mail column, of which I’m a keen student. Consider Stephen Glover asking rhetorically: “Couldn’t Afua Hirsch summon a smidgen of gratitude?” Or Amanda Platell deploring Stormzy’s mention of Grenfell at the Brits one year, asking: “Can’t you show a scintilla of gratitude, Stormzy?” The argument is always that “this country” has given people like Stormzy a good life and they should shut up complaining. And yet, why should it be only – how to put this delicately? – people like Stormzy who should show gratitude? Why can’t it be, say, newspaper columnists? To pluck an example from the air, Amanda Platell – not born here, incidentally – spends the rest of her columns complaining strongly and occasionally erroneously and distastefully about people and events in the UK. Meanwhile, Stormzy – born here, incidentally – doesn’t seem to get to have similarly strong and occasionally erroneous and distasteful views about people and events in the UK. Why? If nothing else, a newspaper columnist telling people to be grateful is like a fisherman telling people to be vegetarian. We’re literally in the complaining game, Amanda! Stop cocking up the business model! I can’t help feeling something similarly ironicidal is happening with Nazanin, where a woman is already having her freedom of speech policed by people who think they’re absolute defenders of it. I mean, not to state the fist-gnawingly obvious here, but isn’t the whole point about liberating someone from the clutches of some backward theocracy that you don’t immediately then go and tell her to know her place? Isn’t the point that you tell her to say whatever the hell she likes, how she likes, and don’t wet your big boy pants about it? You don’t have to agree with her. But you don’t get to tell her what to say, much less to say nothing at all. And if the home counties hardliners don’t like it, maybe they could #GoAndLiveInIran?
