12/31/2021,"In 2001 John Howard’s government was forced to confront two major corporate collapses: HIH Insurance and Ansett Airlines, which at the time had roughly half the domestic airline market. The release of the 2001 cabinet papers by the National Archives of Australia reveals the government was initially reluctant to intervene in either collapse, but quickly realised that was politically unsustainable and economically dangerous.  HIH, valued at $8bn, was one of Australia’s leading insurers. Its collapse was the largest in Australia’s history. On 15 March 2001 Tony McGrath announced his appointment as provisional liquidator and estimated HIH had lost more than $800m over the six months to 31 December 2000. He attributed the failure to reckless management, incompetence, fraud, greed and self-dealing, among other things. The impacts were immediate. HIH operated in many sectors vital to the economy: workers’ compensation, builders’ warranty insurance, small business insurance and compulsory third party vehicle insurance. On 18 April cabinet met to consider the unfolding catastrophe, noting that the collapse raised “serious and complex issues” about HIH’s corporate governance, market disclosure and possible insolvent trading. It also raised questions about the supervision of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and protection of policyholders. The cabinet agreed the government “should reject any suggestion that the Commonwealth fund any uncovered claims” and “reject any responsibility in relation to insurance claims of HIH policyholders where state governments have statutory responsibility”. The government instead resolved to set up a taskforce to look into what had gone wrong, particularly in relation to the role of Apra and the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. But by 11 May, that position was no longer sustainable. Stories of personal hardship emerged almost immediately. Sick and disabled policyholders claiming on salary continuance policies with HIH stopped receiving payments (which they often relied on for day-to-day living expenses). In Queensland alone, car accident victims insured with HIH were left waiting for operations and other medical procedures worth $190m. The Australian Rugby Union had to cancel games until replacement cover could be procured. The building industry was threatening to grind to a halt. The cabinet was told “the HIH collapse is likely to be one of the largest ever insurance industry collapses worldwide”. “Net outstanding liabilities could amount to $4bn worldwide including $1.3bn in Australia and a further $1.1bn relating to compulsory third party motor vehicle insurance and workers compensation.” They were in fact higher. Within 10 days, the cabinet was considering a bailout package and had set up a company, HIH Claims Support, which would cover 100c in the dollar for claims relating to injury, income support and household policies for permanent Australian residents and citizens. Small businesses would receive 90c in the dollar. The scheme would also cover the local government sector but would exclude non-citizens, non-residents and reinsurance. On 4 June the cabinet decided a royal commission into the collapse was required. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Investigations into the cause of the collapse led to the conviction and imprisonment of an HIH director, Rodney Adler, director and executive Ray Williams and businessman Brad Cooper. More corporate trouble loomed in September. The 9/11 attacks rocked the aviation industry, and came at a bad time for Australia’s second airline, Ansett, which had been losing $1.3m a day. On 12 September the government refused to bail out the carrier, despite their counterparts across the Tasman saving Air New Zealand, Ansett’s major shareholder. On 14 September Ansett and its subsidiaries had their fleets grounded and administrators appointed. This put about 16,000 employees out of work, the largest mass job loss in Australian history. A cabinet minute from 14 September records the cabinet’s sense of urgency as it realised how devastating a collapse of this magnitude could be just weeks from a federal election. Many Ansett employees had been with the airline all their lives, and were owed very significant entitlements, which they stood to lose. Worse still, many regional areas depended on Ansett for their only air services. The cabinet’s first priorities were to continue services and to address “stranded communities” urgently. The cabinet noted it was “uncertain what Air New Zealand’s obligations were in relation to employee entitlements” and that “the government will pursue all available avenues in an effort to ensure that Air NZ meets its obligations”. But in the meantime it resolved to implement a special employee entitlements scheme, funded through a levy on airline tickets. There were several meetings over the coming days and weeks as the Howard government tried desperately to restore services. On 17 September, the deputy prime minister, John Anderson, reported to the cabinet that 22 of the 32 regional routes serviced exclusively by Ansett had alternative services, and another five would be serviced by the end of the day. Attempts to revive Ansett in some form continued into 2002 before being abandoned. For a while the administrators operated a pared back airline. Ansett’s last flight took off on 4 March 2002, nearly 70 years after the airline was founded by Sir Reg Ansett. The twin collapses in 2002 may have served as useful lessons for future governments. Even where private enterprise may be to blame, the failure of companies providing critical services can hit governments just as hard.",News/Australia news,HIH and Ansett: how the Howard government was forced to act over giant corporate collapses ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/01/hih-and-ansett-how-the-howard-government-was-forced-to-act-over-giant-corporate-collapses
12/31/2021,"Twenty years on from the Tampa affair, which prompted the offshore detention of hundreds of asylum seekers – sometimes for years – John Howard remains unapologetic. In an interview with the Guardian ahead of the release of the 2001 cabinet papers by the National Archives of Australia, , the former prime minister said his tough policies had “saved lives” and that European nations were now facing a similar dilemma about how to avoid asylum seekers drowning at sea.  “I thought the Australian public supported what we did over Tampa and generally supported what we did on offshore processing – quite strongly,” Howard said. “The Australian public’s position on migration has always been they are supportive of it provided it’s properly controlled. But once they think it’s getting out of control they reduce their level of support, and when it’s again under control they go back to supporting.” In August 2001 the Norwegian freighter Tampa answered a mayday call from Australian authorities to rescue a boatload of 433 asylum seekers sinking in international waters off Christmas Island. But once the Tampa had rescued them, it was refused permission to enter Australian waters. As the stalemate continued over several days, the asylum seekers, many of whom were in poor health, became agitated. Captain Arne Rinnan decided to sail towards Christmas Island, prompting the Australian government to send 45 SAS troops to board the vessel and prevent it coming any closer. The event drew international attention. Howard said he did not recall any substantial concerns from his ministers about whether Australia was breaching its international obligations under the law of the sea. “In something like that you would always have a few concerns from the department, but I never had any concerns about the legality of it,” he said. Asked whether it was “a big move” to put Australian troops on to a civilian maritime vessel, Howard said: “It was a big move by them to defy a request by us not to enter our territorial waters. I would call it a proportionate response.” The Norwegians, however, were very upset. “I had a discussion with [the then Norwegian prime minister, Jens] Stoltenberg, who is now head of Nato, and he thought it was all our problem,” Howard said. “That was before the action. He was under no illusion, and [Australia’s foreign minister at the time] Alexander Downer warned their foreign minister we would take action.” What happened over coming days would define Australia’s treatment of people arriving by boat for years to come. It would begin what became known as the “Pacific solution”, with offshore processing and detention used explicitly to dissuade people smugglers from offering Australia as a destination. The 2001 cabinet papers provide very little insight into the thinking of the government during the immediate crisis, but they show the government had been worried about a wave of arrivals before then. In July 2001, the cabinet considered a submission from the immigration minister, Philip Ruddock, warning that intelligence suggested there was a pool of 6,000 asylum seekers looking to enter Australia and “uncorroborated reports” of a vessel being prepared that could carry 3,000 people. The cabinet was told that a further 1,600 arrivals would exhaust Australia’s available detention capacity. Ruddock was given the go-ahead to begin contingency planning for more facilities in Darwin and South Australia. By August he was informing the cabinet that there were a high number of arrivals on Ashmore and Christmas Island, despite efforts to thwart people smugglers in Indonesia, and “interventions” and surveillance at sea. The Tampa crisis in August prompted a dramatic response from the government. First it moved to excise Ashmore reef and Christmas Island from Australia’s migration zone. The government then decided to take the asylum seekers to Nauru. Howard explained that the decision to opt for offshore processing was “for legal reasons” – to ensure that those transferred from the Tampa would be unable to avail themselves of the Australian legal system. On 7 October the cabinet agreed to provide $45m for a new processing centre on Nauru. The decision, made without a submission, does not provide any insights into why Nauru was chosen. Howard denied that the policy of requiring refugees to stay on Nauru was harsh. “Quite the opposite. It had a remarkable demonstration effect. It stopped the boats, and, as it turned out, saved lives,” he told the Guardian. The handling of the Tampa affair and implementation of the Pacific solution attracted international criticism. Most of the people on the Tampa were Hazaras fleeing persecution in Afghanistan and were settled in New Zealand and Australia, having been found to be refugees deserving of resettlement. However, the policy did have a deterrent effect. In the six years from 2002, only 23 boats arrived in Australia compared with 43 carrying more than 5,000 asylum seekers in 2001 alone. Two more important events unfolded in 2001 that would shape the debate over asylum seekers and the policies both sides took to election. On 19 October an Indonesian fishing boat carrying more than 400 asylum seekers en route to Christmas Island capsized in international waters with the loss of all on board. The Siev X, as it was designated, prompted a fierce debate about the new policy. “It was terrible,” Howard said. “I can’t remember where I was. It was a tragic incident, but I don’t think it was because of something we had done. We tried to stop people starting out. “I don’t accept that you can draw a direct link between that tragic incident and the action we took on the Tampa. I would not accept that. “This is a very fraught area and we are seeing that play out now in the English Channel and in Europe. “It requires us not just to think of the immediate responses of countries who people are trying reach, but also the countries and circumstances that causes them to flee. In a perfect world, benign interventions and sanctions by everybody would prevent a lot of these things from occurring. “I think the Australian policy we introduced in 2001 did save lives. It was controversial. I think the consequences of Kevin Rudd’s relaxation of it were there for all to see. I think you can draw a direct link between that change and some of the tragic incidents that followed.” The other case was the “children overboard” affair, which occurred the day before the election was called but surfaced during the campaign. The immigration minister and other senior ministers, including Howard, claimed incorrectly that a Defence photo showed asylum seekers throwing children overboard in an attempt to secure rescue and passage to Australia. Doubt was cast on the accuracy of this claim by the Australian and it was subsequently found to be untrue by a Senate committee. But during the campaign the false narrative became potent political fuel in the debate over migration policy. Howard said he did not regret making the claims. “It was the advice we had at the time. I mentioned it myself a couple of times and then it dropped out of public consciousness until right at the end of the campaign when a couple of people made some comments to the Australian,” he said. “It wasn’t a big issue in the campaign. Our critics said we won the election based on children overboard, but that was nonsense.” The Tampa crisis was swiftly followed by the 11 September attacks in the US. Howard was in Washington and saw one of the hijacked planes strike the Pentagon from his hotel window. The archives historian, Assoc Prof Chris Wallace, argues in her essay accompanying the release of the 2001 papers that the threat of terrorism became fused in popular perception with the asylum seeker issue by political design as well as chronological proximity. “2001 is the year when Australia pivoted into this new securitised mindset, partly driven by events but to a significant extent by political choice,” she wrote. “This pivot is evident in the 2001 cabinet papers release in which domestic submissions, free from a securitisation mindset, dominate until Tampa and the September 11 attacks occur,” she said. The papers themselves provide little insight into cabinet discussions about 11 September. On 14 September the government invoked the Anzus treaty – one of the few times Howard preempted cabinet, he said. A cabinet minute of that date records a short period of silence was observed and notes that 90 Australians were still unaccounted for. Sunday 16 September was declared a day of mourning. But there was also early sensitivity to the potential divisions that a focus on terrorism and the Islamic backgrounds of those involved in the attacks could provoke. “Cabinet also noted the importance of ensuring that no member of the Australian community should feel vulnerable because of their ethnic or cultural heritage in the aftermath of the attacks,” the minute says. On 10 December the national security committee turned down a request for Australia to provide a protective escort to US naval vessels in the straits of Malacca, ahead of a visit to Indonesia by the prime minister scheduled for February 2002. Howard said at the archives briefing he was “always mindful of Indonesia, being our neighbour and the largest Muslim country in the world, particularly after 9/11 and the focus on Islamist extremism”. The committee also said it would wait for a formal request from the US before committing more than the 100 SAS troops already deployed in Afghanistan on counter-terrorism duties. A week later, however, the cabinet agreed to engage in further discussions with the UK government over joining a multinational stabilisation force, but said it would be “limited to no more than two infantry companies”. Over the next 20 years Australia’s commitment would be much greater, leading to our longest conflict to date. At the archives briefing, Howard denied that the government’s responses to the two events were exploited to win the election. He said the polls were already improving for him and domestic policies dominated the campaign. But the twin issues eroded support for Labor’s Kim Beazley, as domestic security became a dominant issue. In November that year Howard won a third term with an increased majority, setting him on a path to becoming Australia’s second-longest-serving prime minister. “It’s a year I will not forget,” said Howard, the master of the understatement.",News/Australia news,"‘It stopped the boats’: John Howard on Tampa, Siev X and the Pacific solution",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/01/it-stopped-the-boats-john-howard-on-tampa-siev-x-and-the-pacific-solution
12/31/2021,"John Howard still describes himself as “climate change agnostic” even though his government proposed an emissions trading scheme before the 2007 election. How different Australia’s response to climate change might have been if he had not lost the election.  The 2001 cabinet papers, released by the National Archives of Australia on Saturday, supply further evidence of serious concerns and active ministerial work on climate change inside the Howard government, the archive’s historian, Chris Wallace said. There were fierce battles, but the cabinet often proved “a moderating force”, she said, forcing ministers to work together on policy solutions. “This can only have happened with John Howard’s assent and it reflects well on him. It arguably reflects, too, Howard’s greater capacity to manage internal policy differences and personnel than his successors possessed,” Wallace said. The faultline within the cabinet was on display in 2001 as it attempted to finalise its stance for a national energy policy to be negotiated with the states through the Council of Australian Governments. Senator Nick Minchin, one the leading climate change sceptics, brought the paper to cabinet in March. “We will continue to be heavily dependent on fossil fuels for the foreseeable future,” it said. It made almost no mention of climate change or renewables, particularly in the energy generation sector. Instead Minchin’s paper put the emphasis on consumer prices, a national energy market and sustained improvements in energy efficiency. Then as now, gas was privileged in the energy mix. There were a number of measures to promote the use and export of natural gas and the development of resources off north-western Australia and the Northern Territory. Robert Hill’s environment department was highly critical of Minchin’s proposal. “[The] cursory treatment of climate change and other environmental issues is not proportionate with their significance for energy policy and for key stakeholders in this sector. Nor is it consistent with the Coag communique of November 2000, which specifically called for the environmental impacts of energy supply and use to be encompassed within this strategy. “We note that the independent inquiry into energy market development and prospects overlooks climate change and other environmental issues. Given that energy market reform has (unwittingly) contributed to rapid and significant emissions growth in what is Australia’s single largest emissions source, we request that the terms of reference for this inquiry encompass options for reducing the greenhouse and adverse environmental impacts of the reform process.” The cabinet decision directed Hill and Minchin to come back “as matter of urgency” with a joint negotiating position on energy policy. Wallace said the papers confirmed that Hill was not alone in those concerns, and that the balance of cabinet opinion was with him. Meanwhile Australia was trying to balance its commitment to work with the international community on climate change against its relationship with its most important ally, the United States. Under President George W Bush, the US had opposed the Kyoto agreement, and ordered a review of its policy led by the vice-president, Dick Cheney, a former executive at the oil services company Halliburton. Howard had already written to Bush saying he shared Bush’s concerns about having a cost-effective outcome from Kyoto but believed an international agreement was the right path. A cabinet memo in May shows Australia was uncertain about where the Cheney review was heading. It noted that the Bush administration’s new energy policy focused “heavily on the supply side and will accelerate growth in United States emissions”, which did not bode well. What to do next? They decided that Howard should write another letter. It would suggest that an effective global framework to address climate change needed to include commitments from all major emitters; unrestricted market-based mechanisms, including emissions trading; an approach to carbon sinks that captured both economic and environmental opportunities; and a facilitative, rather than punitive, compliance system. Howard told Bush US leadership was essential if efforts to address climate change were to be successful. In February 2002, Bush announced his alternative to the Kyoto protocol, with a plan to reduce the intensity of greenhouse gases by 18% over 10 years – that meant emissions would still continue to grow, but more slowly. Because of the US position, getting agreement of other nations on Kyoto was difficult but eventually 192 parties signed the treaty. Australia was permitted to take account of changes in land-clearing policy, which allowed it to achieve its target. Water, salinity and land clearing were important environmental issues for cabinet in 2001. In March the cabinet agreed on a detailed offer to the Queensland premier, Peter Beattie, for commonwealth support to reduce land clearing in Queensland to help meet the nation’s Kyoto targets. Up to $50m would be made available on a 50:50 basis with the state to buy back land and reduce land clearing from 200,000 hectares a year to 50,000 by 2006.",News/Australia news,Before Australia’s climate wars: when a Coalition cabinet leaned towards positive action ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/01/before-australias-climate-wars-when-a-coalition-cabinet-leaned-towards-positive-action
12/31/2021,"The 2001 cabinet papers provide more evidence of how John Howard wanted to use welfare and Indigenous policy to shape national attitudes over coming decades. Howard began his term as prime minister in 1996 pledging to create an Australia that was “comfortable and relaxed”.  The papers, released by the National Archives on Saturday, show how Howard, inherently a social conservative, concentrated his efforts on policies he believed would appeal to the “battlers”. In March 2001 the cabinet turned its attention to a report on welfare reform by the chief executive of Mission Australia, Patrick McClure. A joint cabinet submission from ministers Amanda Vanstone (family and community services) and Tony Abbott (employment and workplace relations) said the report offered an opportunity to tackle the social and economic issues of welfare dependency and that a “level of compulsion [was] desirable in moving individuals towards economic participation”. While they acknowledged that a social safety net was a key component of a civilised society, Vanstone and Abbott proposed “targeted interventions” for people on unemployment benefits, older person allowances and parenting payments. “More needs to be done to ensure that people stay constantly ‘on the radar screen’,” the submission said. It proposed a series of targeted interventions, including regular reporting by recipients, literacy programs and a work-for-the-dole scheme. The submission sought extra funds – up to $1bn over four years – to implement the plan, but promised big savings and social change down the track. This concept of mutual obligation would shape the political discourse on social security for the next two decades – including the Abbott government’s 2014 budget, which drew howls of protest from the welfare sector. Academics such as Shaun Wilson and Nick Turnbull at the University of New South Wales have explored whether Howard’s welfare reforms were an exercise in wedge politics – “a calculated political tactic aimed at using divisive social issues to gain political support, weaken opponents and strengthen control over the political agenda”. “The election of the Howard government marked a paradigm shift in welfare policy with the implementation of far reaching reforms around the concept of mutual obligation,” they wrote. “Howard’s new welfare paradigm defined welfare as a problem associated with ‘dependency culture’ and linked reforms to specific social groups (single mothers, young unemployed, new migrants).” The Vanstone/Abbott submission show particular concern about single parents. “Australia has one of the highest incidences of children living in families without work. The need for reform is urgent. We should seize the opportunity provided by the McClure report and broader community support for these directions, to tackle the future of welfare dependency and entitlement that is driving welfare outlays.” The submission proposed requiring single parents with children over 13 to work, while those with children between six and 13 would have annual interventions. The result was a major shift in the welfare system from “passive” income support to the “expectation that all income support recipients of workforce age will be actively engaged so that, wherever possible, they are guided towards independence and away from social exclusion and welfare dependence”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The increased interactions required with Centrelink as a result of the Howard government’s reforms were not without controversy. In September 2001, Vanstone asked for extra Centrelink call centre funding, given the serious problem clients had getting their calls answered, with “around 25,000 customers being unable to reach an operator on some days”, equating to “85% of callers receiving a busy signal”. The department of the prime minister and cabinet noted that: “Ready access to Centrelink services is essential to maintain the fairness of the social support system, particularly as income support recipients can be penalised (‘breached’) for failing to contact Centrelink.” The cabinet decided Centrelink could have a short-term loan to increase its call centre capacity and Vanstone should come back with a demand management strategy for consideration. In 1988, Galarrwuy Yunupingu and Wenten Rubuntja presented the Barunga Statement to then prime minister, Bob Hawke, who promised to progress a treaty by 1990. He was unable to fulfil his promise to First Nations, but lobbying for a treaty continued. In March 2001 the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (Atsic) proposed directing $4m of its budget to a Treaty Advisory Committee, but met with staunch opposition. The government confirmed in a March cabinet minute its “clearly expressed opposition to a treaty”. The cabinet opposed the additional funds and suggested the “first priority for ATSIC funds should be used to address key areas of indigenous disadvantage (including health and housing)”. The same month, in response to the 1997 Bringing Them Home report into the stolen generations, the cabinet decided against a formal apology to Indigenous Australians “affected by family separation”. The cabinet judged it was “not appropriate given that the practices were at the time believed to be in the best interests of the children concerned and were sanctioned by the laws at the time”. Financial compensation was also judged “neither [an] appropriate nor practical response to assist in healing the trauma caused by family separations, nor could it be equitably applied”. Atsic was instead granted an additional $4.9 m over two years for a Link Up family reunion program, on top of $63m that had earlier been allocated for the response. The cabinet also proposed asking Atsic to consider undertaking consultations on a national memorial to Indigenous people separated from their families. This was superseded by a cabinet decision in June, upon oral submission from Howard, that “Reconciliation Place is to be constructed in the Parliamentary Zone, Canberra and will include national recognition of the issue of indigenous children separated from their families”.",News/Australia news,Where ‘mutual obligation’ began: John Howard’s paradigm shift on welfare,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/01/where-mutual-obligation-began-john-howards-paradigm-shift-on-welfare
12/31/2021,"The ABC’s relationship with the Howard government was never easy, and the 2001 cabinet papers, released by the National Archives on Saturday, reveal tensions between the government’s desire for budget cuts and fear of alienating its supporters who valued the national broadcaster. Despite having promised during the 1996 election campaign that the ABC’s budget was safe, within four months of coming to office John Howard’s government cut it by 2% and announced a review of the role and scope of ABC services by Bob Mansfield, the founding chief executive of Optus.  Howard’s senior adviser, Grahame Morris, characterised the ABC as “our enemy talking to our friends” and Howard himself had accused the broadcaster of being left-leaning. But the dilemma for the Coalition was the ABC was valued by its supporters, particularly in the bush, and cuts to the ABC often played badly in the regions. The cabinet papers released by the National Archives provide more evidence of the uneasy relationship. The ABC responded to the 1996 cuts by announcing it would dispose of its international television service – seen as an important part of Australia’s soft power efforts in the Asia Pacific region. Much to the Howard government’s delight, the international service was taken over by the Kerry Stokes-owned Seven Network in 1998, which hoped to use it to expand into Asia. But by 2000 Stokes was losing money and sought a $15m-a-year subsidy from the government. The cabinet papers record the frustrations of the cabinet in trying to keep the Seven-owned service alive. In March 2001 it approved Seven’s request for $15m, noting this was “not optimal” – only for Seven to pull out anyway. At that point the foreign affairs minister, Alexander Downer, intervened. Downer had been unhappy with the cuts to Radio Australia and wanted to restore Australia’s broadcasting presence in the region. Cabinet ministers also complained about the Stokes service, having turned it on in hotel rooms to find it screening Humphrey B Bear. Downer successfully pushed for funding to revive Radio Australia from near-death and for a new television service, to be tendered by his department. The process drew an array of would-be broadcasters, including a start-up led by the former ABC chief executive David Hill. Seven and the ABC initially declined to take part, until the government persuaded the ABC’s managing director, Jonathan Shier, to join in. The ABC’s bid won and the government reluctantly signed up, agreeing to its demand for editorial independence. The papers show the cabinet musing over whether the decision to grant the service to the ABC would be seen as “a backflip”. But there were also concerns about going with Hill’s private proposal, and the risks of going with “an untried company”. Relations between the ABC and the Howard government did not improve, however, as the 2002 cabinet papers may show. That was the year the communications minister, Richard Alston, lodged 67 complaints about bias with the national broadcaster.",News/Australia news,John Howard and the ABC: desire for cuts came up against Liberal support for broadcaster,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/01/john-howard-and-the-abc-desire-for-cuts-came-up-against-liberal-support-for-broadcaster
12/31/2021,"The mother of a teenager who was murdered in 2018 has demanded an apology from police after learning that an officer kept pictures he took of himself lying down at the scene of the killing. Mandy Jamieson, whose son Daniel Gee-Jamieson was stabbed to death aged 16, accused the officer, Ryan Connolly, of sullying the memory of her child. It came after the Guardian revealed Connolly had been caught with that picture and another of a man suffering a mental health crisis, as well as having sent “appalling” racist, homophobic and offensive images via WhatsApp.  “What he did was disgusting and heartless, especially as a police officer who is supposed to protect people. He has trampled on the memory of my son as far as I am concerned,” Jamieson said. “I want an apology from the police – I think I deserve one. They did not even tell me and I only found out about it from the press. “I had to speak to the mayor about it and she got a CID detective to ring me. I am so angry about it but not surprised. It is shocking the way victims and their families are treated in this country,” she told MailOnline. Connolly’s case echoes that of the two Metropolitan police officers who used their mobile phones to take pictures at the scene where two sisters lay murdered. The pair were convicted in court after admitting misconduct in public office. He had already resigned from Merseyside police by the time a gross misconduct hearing was held in November. The discipline tribunal found Connolly guilty after deciding he had committed a litany of disciplinary offences over a six-year period while a serving officer. He was formally sacked after the hearing. The force has been criticised this week for its handling of the case. Vinny Tomlinson, the former chair of Merseyside’s Black Police Association, who attended the tribunal hearing, said: “In all of my time working at Merseyside police, Connolly’s conduct is the worst example of one person’s misconduct of this type I can recall. He transgressed on an almost industrial scale, over a number of years, most of which was carried out whilst he was on duty. “Why has Connolly not faced criminal charges for misconduct in a public office and data protection breaches? Have all of the individuals abused by Connolly been contacted by Merseyside police and aware? Have the family of the murder victim been informed of Connolly’s behaviour at the scene of their son’s murder? “Why has Merseyside police still not published the outcome of Connolly’s hearing within 28 days as it is required to do?” On Wednesday, Merseyside police’s deputy chief constable, Ian Critchley, said: “I am appalled by Connolly’s actions, they are beyond comprehension and are not in keeping with the high standards and values that we expect here.” He added: “Our officers carry out exceptionally brave selfless acts every single day, protecting the most vulnerable people in our communities, yet here we see the despicable acts of a very selfish individual who has no place in our police service.” Critchley called Connolly’s behaviour “deplorable”, saying it served to “undermine the public’s confidence and trust in the police”.",News/UK news,Mother asks for police apology over officer’s selfie of murdered son,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/31/mother-asks-for-police-apology-over-officers-ryan-connolly-selfie-of-murdered-son
12/31/2021,"It was never my intention to hide in the toilet. There was lots going on outside: highbrow small talk and top-tier networking; free drinks, air kisses, and cold canapés that – I’d quickly discovered, following glances – were very much, like my fellow attenders, there only for show. The gallery was filled, I’d been assured, with fashion figures and media leaders. I was lucky to have been invited to this salon, one of the hosts had informed me, generously. Exactly what a “salon” is, I’m still unsure. Deep down, I just didn’t want to be there. Only 90 minutes previously I’d been watching Gogglebox and scoffing Pringles in bed. But I went along out of some sense of duty. Perhaps a desire to broaden my horizons, or a compulsion to step outside my comfort zone, where I had become too safe and snug. Now here I was, sitting in a locked cubicle counting down the minutes before I could leave without seeming rude.  All too often I’d go through this same, stupid motion. Preoccupied by getting older, and worrying that I was wasting my finite time on Earth lying on the sofa, I’d panic that before I knew it, I’d be staring down death, full of regret. Put bluntly, I’d get a serious case of Fomo (fear of missing out). This feeling tends to peak in Januarys when, rather than hibernate, as would be eminently sensible, I cajole myself into believing exposure therapy will somehow improve me. I say yes to park jogs, parties and once, a ceilidh. But this year, I’m refusing to be sucked in again – I’m determined to embrace saying yes to saying no to things I simply don’t want to do. For most of my young adult life, I latched on to the idea that – generally speaking – I was quite boring, fairly lazy, a healthy dose of dull. I’d be mortified if anyone gave me those labels; after all, I’m pretty good value at weddings, funerals and barmitzvahs (and I do attend most of the ones I’m invited to) – but I still had a growing feeling that I wasn’t making enough of life’s precious moments. When did the Fomo start? At school, reports often featured the words “must try harder” – and I suppose the idea stuck. There’d been a relationship, my first of substance, where circumstances meant I internalised the idea that I was dreary and unexciting. Friends would flock to underground parties and dance until mid-morning and I’d drag myself out to join them, moving miserably around the darkness until I was too exhausted to continue, or too drunk to care. It’s not that there were rules over what I did or didn’t enjoy; it’s more that I’d force myself to go out, and stay out – whether or not I actually wanted to – out of obligation to my future, dying self. In short, a pattern developed. Life was punctuated by me doing things I didn’t really want to, because otherwise I’d berate myself for doing just enough, sometimes too little, and almost never too much. That’s precisely how I’d ended up at this art show. Arriving alone, I started talking, reluctantly, to a serious man named Simon. He told me his opinions; we stared at some art. As soon as was not unkind, I excused myself, and beelined to the bathrooms. I sat there for a while, staring at the wall. Maybe 10 minutes later, I returned to the action. There was a discussion about poetry, or was it pottery? The bar ran out of white wine. It felt like everyone was there for the same reason as me – because they felt as if they should be. I’m sure I wasn’t the only one having a godawful time. Recently, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about that evening. I’m coming to realise, slowly but surely, that I’d like to reimagine how I spend my time. All sorts of things have contributed to this contrition: dead grandparents; new nephews; approaching 30. Growing a little older has made me less inclined to do anything that feels void of all pleasure and joy. Then there are the complications of Covid. I’m lucky to be fit and healthy, but now each event – birthday, work breakfast, day trip – comes with a complex new set of calculations related to my health and safety: is it worth the risk? I’m trying to apply the same thinking to whether I’ll actually enjoy something, too. That means accepting invitations, but also politely declining – and making these decisions based on what I want to do, not what I feel I should. I’m still open to new experiences, people and places. Only now I admit defeat calmly, rather than feeling shameful if I throw in the towel. I might not always know what I’ll love or what will feel soul-destroying. But I’m trying to ignore the pressure to be proactive, and instead listen to my gut. It’s harder than it sounds. In his 2012 book Missing Out, psychoanalyst Adam Phillips questions what it means to consider the life unlived. “The myth of our potential,” he writes, “can make of our lives a perpetual falling-short … Now someone is asking us not only to survive but to flourish, not simply or solely to be good but to make the most of our lives.” The premise of Phillips’ position has never been truer. Ours is a society consumed and fixated by the effective use of time. Social media platforms often face blame for turning their users into sad, anxious scrollers, and for good reason. But the fact these sites also demand that we are constantly productive is often overlooked. Instagram insists we have something to show; Twitter requires us to always think something. We live in the “experience economy”, where value is derived from doing. The pandemic has taught us that we don’t know what’s around the corner; to make the most of now. It feels as if some teenagers plough more effort into their TikToks than I have into my entire career. It feels something of an obsession, to be efficient not only in our work, but with our leisure time, too. Because Yolo, far from being a harmless catchphrase, – made famous by Drake in 2011’s The Motto – is actually an insidious idiom; another iteration of the toxic “do one thing that scares you” and “make every moment count” nonsense which has slowly come to poison our daily lives. I’m by no means advocating for total abstinence from ambition. Climb mountains! Learn languages! Tell me your fascinating stories about doing so over wine. It’s just that maybe making the most of every moment can also come from giving up rather than grinning and bearing it. It’s all well and good to try new things, but I’m trying to regularly remind myself that MasterChef is pretty great (as is watching YouTube compilations in my pants and scrolling through Scottish homes on Rightmove). It’s early days, but I’ve already noticed I’m feeling calmer, more comfortable. Of course, this is all a reflection of the stage of life I find myself at: with no kids or caring responsibilities. No doubt there will come a day when I would make a deal with the devil to once again have the chance to pay £8 for a can of Red Stripe to drink while bopping about on sticky floors. But for now, at least, I’m free to make this opting-out choice. One weekend late last year, my friends, my boyfriend and I rented a place by the seaside. On the Friday, we merrily trotted between quaint country pubs. Our Saturday, it had been mutually agreed by all attending, was to be spent walking. A proper hike. Through battering winds, we’d march for six to seven hours across the coastal cliffs of Sussex. Ninety minutes later, we’d barely made a dent in our proposed path and I was exhausted. I checked my phone, and realised that 30 minutes inland we’d get to a bus stop which would take us home. Usually, I’d have marched on, metaphorically sat in that toilet. Instead, I announced I quite fancied taking the bus. A look of relief spread across everyone’s faces. Turns out we all wanted to throw in the towel. And so we did.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Say no to Fomo: how I embraced staying in,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/31/say-no-to-fomo-how-i-embraced-staying-in
12/31/2021,"My fashion new year resolution is to cut myself some slack. To quit trying to be someone I’m not. So I am going to stop wearing things that make me feel bad about myself. As of today, it’s goodbye to clothes bought on their promise that they would transform me into a shinier, sleeker, optimised version of myself. It’s time to breathe a sigh of relief and get back to wearing what I feel comfortable in. So I am breaking up with athleisure. I am throwing off the shackles of compression leggings. Burning the racer-back long-line sports bra with its modish charcoal-and-terracotta colour palette. Breaking free of the breathable mesh tanks with empowering slogans in Yale University-adjacent font across the front. Unzipping the cropped hoodie and unlacing my trainers.  Athleisure is supposed to be comfortable, but as a fancy urban uniform it has begun to feel a lot like peer pressure. High heels rightly get a bad press for showcasing physical sexuality, exaggerating the sway of hips, emphasising breasts and bottoms. But athleisure also puts your body front and centre of who you are – and not just because leggings and crop tops put your musculature and body fat percentage on display. Athleisure doesn’t have to be skin-tight to put the spotlight on your appearance. Even if it is a tracksuit, modern coordinated workout gear tells the world that exercise and fitness are of paramount importance to you, that the physical shape of your body is a core value. Athleisure is power dressing for narcissists. This is absolutely not about giving up exercise, by the way. That’s not the point, and anyway for me it’s not an option, because like a lot of people I start to lose the plot if I go more than a couple of days without a run or a class. But that doesn’t mean I have to parade around in the kit all day. Exercise is great, but we don’t need to shove our workout schedules down each other’s throats, right? I mean, I cook dinner most nights but I don’t go to work in my apron. So I plan to embrace old-school gym clothes. The stuff we used to wear to work out before the advent of public-facing yoga gear and running tops that come with matching scrunchies. To be clear, I’m not intending to burn sports bras, or anything else. But I still have a drawer full of promotional T-shirts whose provenance has been lost in the mists of time, and tracksuit bottoms whose best days date to a world pre-selfies, and I’m going back to wearing those. It is not so many years ago that wearing flat shoes to a cocktail party was a bold and brave wardrobe choice. These days, comfortable shoes are the norm and no one is wearing high heels unless they happen to feel like doing so that evening. So it is, now, that in a queue for an oat latte and a sourdough loaf on a Saturday morning, the shiniest, most living-their-best-life people will be in athleisure, and wearing jeans feels a bit beta. If fancy athleisure could be just a little less visible all around us, it might help us de-escalate a situation in which body image takes up way too much headspace. Like, I love going to pilates, but I don’t think it’s the meaning of life, you know? Lycra gives plenty of stretch, but the mindset of wearing athleisure doesn’t cut you a lot of slack. Athleisure is the whalebone corset of the 21st century. I’m off to slip into something more comfortable.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Cut loose!

12/31/2021,"Butterflies, hedgehogs and bats are at risk as the unseasonably mild weather has disrupted hibernation in the UK and is causing spring flowers to bloom in January. Climate change is disrupting the seasons, and this year the winter has been especially mild, with trees not dropping their autumn leaves and others bursting into fresh leaf and bloom months early. This New Year’s Eve is expected to be the mildest on record, with temperatures predicted to hit 15C in some parts of the country – double the average temperature for this time of year.  This could have devastating effects for creatures that depend on the rhythm of the seasons for survival. While a low-pressure system is behind the unseasonal warmth, experts say background temperature rises caused by climate change are exacerbating the issue. Grahame Madge, a climate spokesperson for the Met Office, said: “The unseasonal warmth that will be a feature of the new year period is caused by a low-pressure system drawing up warm air from further south in the Atlantic. Although this would have always created relatively much warmer conditions compared with average, with around 1C of background warming, it is possible that climate change will bring the event to a point that challenges previously held records.” He said this could cause butterflies to be killed off as they emerge from hibernation too early before sufficient food is available, especially as a deadly later cold snap could hit. Madge said: “Abnormal warm spells during winter can encourage species out of hibernation. Butterflies such as red admirals and small tortoiseshells and other insects can be particularly challenged as they can emerge largely without access to life-saving food sources like nectar. If the warm spell is followed by a return to colder conditions, the hibernating individuals will have used up valuable energy reserves without being able to replace them, possibly with disastrous consequences.” The unseasonably warm weather has been confusing for hibernating mammals, which have been emerging from their slumber early. This could be fatal for creatures including hedgehogs, which are waking without sufficient food to sustain them until spring. Kathryn Brown, the director for climate action for The Wildlife Trusts, said: “Our climate is changing, which is having an impact on whole ecosystems as well as individual species. The warming climate is affecting breeding cycles, the availability of food, and behaviours including hibernation. Unusually mild temperatures mean that some species can temporarily emerge from hibernation more often in winter, which is problematic if there is insufficient food to make up for the extra energy used. We know that hedgehogs are at increased risk, and we need more research to understand the effects on other hibernating species such as bats and dormice.” Horticulturalists have noticed that roses have been in bloom all winter, much like in more Mediterranean climes, and colourful spring flowers are already bursting into bloom across British gardens. Matthew Pottage, the curator of the Royal Horticultural Society’s Wisley garden, said: “There are both pros and cons related to the current mild weather for plants and gardens. Out-of-season plants such as roses will, for example, continue to flower, and spring plants like magnolia will likely begin to bloom earlier than normal, which will bring a welcome bit of colour into gardens from early next year if the mild weather continues.” Gardeners and farmers have greatly missed the frosts that kill off pests. Certain fungi and insects now thrive all year round. Pottage said: “The lack of a cold snap will enable exotic plant varieties to continue to flourish but the downside is gardeners will continue to experience some garden pests until significant frosts arrive to kill them off.” Experts at the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI) are asking gardeners to chronicle unusually early blooms in their garden. This has become a growing phenomenon as the seasons become more muddled. Louise Marsh, from the BSBI, said: “We have seen reports on social media of plants in bloom at the moment that have raised a few eyebrows … I expect we will see a similar pattern to previous years – hundreds of species in bloom.” “It isn’t, however, a straightforward story of everything coming into bloom early. We usually find that about half the species in bloom are ‘autumn stragglers’ that have managed to keep on flowering because they haven’t been knocked back by hard frosts; around a quarter are all-year-rounders (typical urban “weeds” such as groundsel, shepherd’s purse, dandelion and daisy) and a few winter specialists such as winter heliotrope; around a quarter are those spring flowers, such as primrose and lesser celandine, blooming early.” There are concerns about the impacts on pollinators if the flowers bloom before they have a chance to take advantage of the nectar, and on migratory birds that feed on fruit and have not yet arrived.",News/Environment,UK’s mild winter puts some butterflies and burrowers at risk,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/31/warm-winter-fatal-for-uk-endangered-species-bats-butterflies-hedgehogs
12/31/2021,"141 containers filled with rotting plastic waste have been on a journey for more than a year. Scattered between Turkey, Greece and Vietnam, far from their origins in Germany, the containers’ voyage sheds light on the hidden global trade in plastic waste. Arriving in Turkey in late 2020, shortly before a ban on mixed plastic waste imports came into force, the containers quickly became the centre of a battle between traders, a shipping line, multiple governments and environmental campaigners demanding their return.  Turkish authorities refused entry to the containers, leaving them in limbo. As they languished in ports across the country, the contents began to rot. “After a couple of months, all the dirty waste inside was disrupted, and some had fermented due to the presence of microorganisms. It smelled really bad and it was covered in rats and mice,” said Sedat Gündoğdu, a plastics pollution researcher based in the southern city of Adana. The year-long saga of the 141 containers is a small slice of the international trade in plastic waste, the ugly underbelly of recycling in the global north. Plastic waste, especially mixed plastic from households, is frequently sent overseas to countries with lax environmental regulations, where it is melted into plastic pellets, dumped, or simply burned. Mixed plastics are the dirtiest and least desirable waste in the trade, as they typically contain household rubbish such as bottles or packaging, meaning a jumble of recyclable plastics with non-recyclable items. As many countries move to ban mixed plastic imports, observers say some traders have taken to hiding bales of banned mixed plastics behind others that pass regulation to sneak them past inspectors. The containers remained stuck after a company involved in their initial journey lost its import licence and disappeared. “The consignee delayed us saying there were some things to sort out with customs. But then we found out their import licence was cancelled, and they were blacklisted by Turkey. Lab tests showed some loads in the containers are hazardous city waste,” said Omer Bulduk of Monax, a Turkish freight company assigned to receive the containers. “It’s simply garbage,” he added. Some of the countries listed among the world’s top recyclers are also the biggest plastic waste exporters: Germany was named the world’s top recycler by the World Economic Forum three years ago, but exports an average of 1m tonnes of plastic waste annually, more than any other nation in the EU. The UK is little better, exporting 61% of its plastic waste according to recent data from the British Plastics Foundation. “When you continue to consume more plastic there are only two ways to tackle the waste. One is incineration, the second is dumping. If you don’t have dumping in your country then you should incinerate. But this has a carbon footprint, and many countries trying to cut carbon emissions don’t want to incinerate their own waste,” said Gündoğdu. “Some of the top waste producers in Europe, like the UK, France and Germany have to find ways to deal with this issue. And the way they’ve found is exporting to poorer countries without effective waste management systems or environmental legislation and regulations. This is waste colonialism,” he said. In May, the Turkish foreign ministry contacted their counterparts in Germany to demand the containers’ return. According to Bulduk, the German side “claimed that too much time had passed and they cannot accept them”. Angela Griesbach, a spokesperson for the waste management authority in the state of Baden-Württemberg, now in charge of overseeing the containers, said this was “probably a misunderstanding,” adding that the containers contained waste that was legal when it arrived in Turkey. When some of the containers of German waste were suddenly re-exported to Vietnam, campaigners sprung into action. Activists believe that the 16 containers sent last July to the port of Hai Phong were a test, to see if others could later follow the same route in order to dispose of the rotting containers entirely. But who authorised their onward travel remains a mystery, especially as sending waste directly from an EU country to those outside the OECD is banned, and new controls on mixed plastic exports introduced last January require express consent from the Vietnamese authorities to import the containers. Vietnam’s own ban on plastic waste imports is due to go into force in 2025, but it remains a popular destination for the global plastic recycling trade. There, workers are paid less than £5 a day to sort plastic into recyclable elements and non-recyclable. The former are melted down, exposing those nearby to toxic fumes. Jim Puckett of the Basel Action Network, a group that campaigns against plastic-related pollution, tracked 37 of the German containers heading towards Piraeus port near Athens in November, and grew suspicious they were also headed to Vietnam. “I dropped what I was doing and sent a strong message to the Greek authorities, saying that they couldn’t allow that waste to get on a ship and go to Vietnam. It’s illegal and it should be returned to Germany,” he said. The Greek authorities took note, and cordoned off the containers on the dock in Piraeus, where they remain. “There’s also almost a hundred containers sitting in Turkey, and we’re very worried they will be bound for countries like Vietnam,” he added. In an open letter to Germany’s newly inaugurated environment ministry, a coalition of green groups including BAN demanded they “take moral and political leadership,” and reclaim the 141 containers. When contacted by the Guardian, the environment ministry referred questions to Griesbach. “The campaigners are right in saying that there are many legal questions and legal grey areas,” she said. She stressed that “a voluntary return shipment by a German company involved is intended but has not yet been possible,” and said the German authorities were unaware that some containers had been re-exported to Vietnam. If certain conditions were met, she added, the containers in Turkey could be returned. “If the problem is not an internal Turkish enforcement problem, the German authorities, as well as the German company voluntarily, are willing to take back this waste in accordance with the law. However, this requires the corresponding cooperation and information from the Turkish side.” The Turkish environment ministry did not respond when contacted for comment on the issue. Vietnam and Turkey are two of a growing number of countries that have seen a sudden spike in plastic waste, after China’s decision to ban waste imports in 2018 proved to be a watershed for the global trade. The decision “reverberated around the world,” according to the United Nations, which added that nations in the global north “will, at last, have to face up to the true cost of their plastic addiction instead of shipping the problem to China, which has taken nearly half the world’s waste since 1992”. “We’ve been sold a notion of ‘don’t worry, we’ll recycle it’ – and no one looked at what recycling was like in China until three years ago,” said Puckett. “We’re putting out more plastic waste into the world, every day more than the day before, and there’s no destination for it. It’s now become a game of who will take it because there are mountains of plastic waste and it’s not stopped.” The result is a frantic hunt for new destinations for an estimated 111m metric tonnes of plastic waste displaced by the ban between now and 2030. While China has banned imports, it continues to profit from the global trade in plastics through its domination of the shipping trade. Cosco shipping, the company that transported all 141 containers, is a Chinese state-owned company. Cosco did not respond when contacted for comment on the issue. Matthew Gordon, an environmental researcher at Yale University who is part of a team compiling an “atlas of plastic waste” to show new plastic dumping sites across the world, said he was surprised by the number of countries represented in their initial findings, including Bosnia, Thailand, Romania, Malaysia and Turkey. “South-east Asia clearly seems to be a hotspot, especially in the aftermath of the China import ban,” he said. “One of the reasons for this seems to be that when container ships travel from places like China to the US carrying manufactured goods, they offer extremely low freight on the return trip – otherwise they would be going back empty. So exporters in the US often find it cheaper to send plastics abroad than to deal with them at home.” Turkey has increasingly found itself on the frontline of the struggle between local plastic importers’ desire to stay in the global recycling trade and rising environmental concerns. After an investigation by Greenpeace found plastic products from British and German supermarket chains intended for recycling dumped by the roadside, Turkey briefly banned all plastic imports last May before rescinding the law soon afterwards. Gündoğdu said new dumping grounds for plastic waste were now springing up again after a brief lull. In Adana, a hub for plastic waste imports, a coalition of local plastics traders wrote their own open letter to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, imploring him to allow the industry to continue. The letter was part of a campaign to rebrand plastic waste imports, under the slogan “It’s not waste, it’s raw material.” The plastic waste industry, they said, employs 300,000 Turkish people. Traders described themselves as “the ones cleaning the environment, not polluting it”. Many Turkish citizens disagree. When asked how they felt about the 800,000 tonnes of plastic waste that Turkey imported last year from the EU, a majority said “very bad,” while others cited a slogan that is rapidly becoming a rallying cry against plastic imports in their country: “Turkey is not a garbage bin.” Additional reporting by Gökçe Saraçoğlu",News/Environment,‘Waste colonialism’: countries grapple with west’s unwanted plastic ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/31/waste-colonialism-countries-grapple-with-wests-unwanted-plastic
12/31/2021,"“I was coming down Mount Snowdon and in the far distance I thought I could see brown people, and I thought my eyes were kidding me. Then, as I descended and got closer, I realised they were women in hijabs. I was like ‘wow Muslim women on the mountain’, like ‘am I dreaming?’” Haroon Mota, the founder of Muslim Hikers, is remembering a walk he did around 15 years ago and, if you look at the statistics, his shock at seeing members of his own community out on the trails makes sense. Only 1% of national park visitors come from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds. A 2021 report by the countryside charity CPRE reported data showing ethnic minorities have, on average, 11 times less access to green space than their white counterparts, and that only 20% of BAME children who visit natural environments go to the countryside, compared with 40% of white children.  The reasons for the racial imbalance outdoors is complicated, and Mota has his own opinions on what the major barriers are, but a diversity review commissioned by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) highlighted that despite people from ethnic minority backgrounds valuing the natural environment and pace of life in the countryside, they felt excluded and hyper-visible in what they see as an “exclusively English environment”. Muslim Hikers is a community group set up by Mota to encourage Muslims to get outside, though anyone is welcome. Since launching the group in 2020, he’s received criticism from trolls for being “exclusionary” and “creating divisions”. Mota brushes those comments off, confident in his values and purpose. “It is what it says on the tin. There is a very clear under-representation and to overcome that, you’ve got to cater for that community. Everybody’s welcome. But our focus is to try and help the Muslim community and I think there’s nothing wrong with that.” The group’s most recent walk was on Christmas day. One hundred walkers came from around the UK to hike up Mam Tor in the Peak District. After the hike, some of them excitedly shared photos of the trip to the Derbyshire and Peak District Walks Facebook group. It wasn’t long until some members of the group left “vile, racist comments”, says Mota. “It’s like the migration of the wildebeests in the Serengeti, they just keep coming,” one white woman wrote underneath the images. While another said: “And I bet not 1 of the 100s help to repair the paths when they become damaged …absolute disgrace.” Responding to the comments, Mota said: “It was such a shame seeing hateful comments ... It’s only a small minority of people who act like this but it sure does provide justification for calls to make the outdoors more diverse and inclusive. It won’t deter us one single bit.” Mota says he has never experienced racism when he’s been hiking and finds the outdoors “a very welcoming space”, however he adds that many people within his hiking group have experienced racist remarks, staring and patronising comments. The CPRE report echoed these attitudes when looking at the key barriers: “One barrier identified was a perception of rural communities as close-knit, white, privileged, older and more conservative than city people, and resistant to change. The associated feeling with this … is that of being unwelcome.” When Mota saw the Muslim women on Snowdon, he excitedly chatted with the group who had travelled from Birmingham for the Islamic Relief charity hike. He exchanged details with the group’s leader and continued his descent. In years of hiking, this was the first time he’d seen brown people out on the hills. “I thought, our people just don’t go outside … I want to do something to try and maybe inspire and empower Muslim communities to get involved.” Mota, who was the European kickboxing champion at 17, has a long history in sport and fitness. “It’s in my DNA,” he says. In his final year at Coventry University studying sport and exercise science, Mota began volunteering for Islamic Relief and his first charity hike was to Everest base camp where he raised £10,000. His passion and flair for fundraising quickly became apparent. “For me, charity is a huge part of my faith,” he says. He has volunteered as the leader on many of Islamic Relief’s charity hikes over the following years, including one to Peru. Now Mota works for the Muslim charity Penny Appeal, arranging and leading charity treks around the world. Three years ago he took 18 British Muslim women to hike to Everest base camp. Shortly afterwards he ran the Berlin Marathon, led a group on a hike to Peru’s Machu Picchu, and another to climb Mount Kilimanjaro. He had many more plans in the pipeline but then Covid struck. With a fundraising pledge to run four of the world’s six major marathons scuppered by lockdown, he chose to run the length of six marathons (260km) in his local area of Coventry instead. Not only did he run 10k a day, but he did it while fasting with no food or drink for 18 hours of the day during Ramadan. He raised over £50,000 for Penny Appeal which helps people in poverty around the world. “I ran voluntarily, but refugees are fleeing war and extreme poverty every day and I ran for them,” Mota explains. After seeing his inspirational resolve, Canadian outdoor brand Arc’teryx asked him to become an ambassador. With the backing of the brand, Mota’s first instinct was to try to invest in his own community and so in 2020, Muslim Hikers was born. Now at nearly 9,000 followers, the group has done three official hikes and is planning more, potentially abroad. Many participants have said the events have been the best thing they’ve ever done, creating friendships for life and a sense of “safety in numbers” in the British outdoors. Muslim Hikers’ second event, called High Chai, was similarly successful selling out in two hours – the group hiked through the Peak District and some of them stopped for afternoon tea at the only independent halal tea room in the area- Millies Tea Rooms, Chocolatier and Bed & Breakfast in Hayfield. A big factor for wanting to get his community outdoors is for health reasons, Mota says. “It’s South Asian communities that suffer the greatest sort of health inequalities. We’re the ones that are dying of diabetes, heart disease and obesity. And then it’s not a coincidence that our physical activity levels are also the lowest - ​​it’s so important for us to encourage our communities to be more healthy.” Mota’s hopes for the future are firmly rooted in community and creating a cultural shift. “We want to help other grassroots initiatives build infrastructure, so we can do more and create long, lasting, sustainable change.” He is already working with national parks to help them increase the diversity of visitors. “When I started running marathons, I automatically became the ‘Muslim marathon man’. When I started climbing mountains, I automatically became the ‘Muslim mountain man’,” he says. Mota wants to change the underrepresentation so that Muslim people doing physical activities becomes the new norm.

12/31/2021,"A statue of Cristiano Ronaldo unveiled in Goa this week has triggered protests by some locals who say Indian footballers should be honoured ahead of one from the country that was Goa’s colonial ruler until 60 years ago. The 400kg statue of the Manchester United and Portugal forward was intended to honour “the love of football” and “inspire our youngsters to take football to greater heights”, tweeted a local politician, Michael Lobo.  But some people waved black flags at the statue’s inauguration. “Very disappointed to hear of the statue of Ronaldo being erected. Learn to take pride in our own icons like Samir Naik and Bruno Coutinho,” one protester told the IANS news agency. The Portugal team is popular in Goa, where many people have links with the European country as a result of its colonial history. But some argued that the statue, unveiled a few days after the 60th anniversary of the day Goa was freed from Portuguese rule, was insensitive and inappropriate. Lobo later said: “When people talk about football, they talk about Cristiano Ronaldo. So we have installed this statue here so boys and girls at a very, very young age get inspiration, they feel inspired, and the love and passion for this game will grow.” He accused the protesters of hating football. It is not the first time a statue of Ronaldo has had a less than enthusiastic reception. In March 2017 a bronze bust of the player unveiled to mark the renaming of Madeira’s main airport in his honour was ridiculed by fans who said it bore little resemblance to their hero. The sculptor Emanuel Santos said his work was just “a matter of taste”. But the following year it was replaced with a new bust, reportedly after a request from Ronaldo’s family. In 2014 a 10ft bronze statue of the player outside his museum in Funchal, Madeira, raised eyebrows for its accentuation of his physique. Ronaldo said the image made him “feel so proud”. Ronaldo, who grew up in poverty with an alcoholic father, went on to become the first footballer to earn $1bn in his career. Statues of other public figures have been criticised for failing to capture the person’s likeness. This year a bronze of Diana, Princess of Wales with three children had a “hint of Theresa May” about it, according to some social media commentators. And in March Cork county council demanded that a €33,000 grant be repaid after a statue of the Hollywood actor Maureen O’Hara was deemed “unacceptable” and “not suitable for installation”.",News/World news,Protests over Cristiano Ronaldo statue in former Portuguese colony of Goa,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/31/protests-over-cristiano-ronaldo-statue-in-former-portuguese-colony-of-goa
12/31/2021,"Ireland has become the latest EU country to cut the isolation period for many people who contract Covid-19, as record infection numbers spark fears of crippling staff shortages in essential public services, as well as retail and hospitality venues. Spain, Portugal and Greece reduced isolation times this week while others, such as Germany and France, are considering doing so and Italy cut its quarantine for fully vaccinated people who come into contact with someone who has tested positive.  The moves follow a similar decision by the US and reflect early research suggesting the highly transmissible Omicron variant fuelling the pandemic’s latest surge generally causes milder illness than earlier versions of the virus. However, the sheer number of people becoming infected – and thus having to self-isolate if they contract the virus, or quarantine if they are a contact of someone who tests positive – threatens to cause chaos in hospitals and on public transport. “Many Omicron cases are going to be asymptomatic,” Rochelle Walensky, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Monday after halving the recommended isolation time for asymptomatic people to five from 10 days. “We want to make sure there is a mechanism by which we can safely continue to keep society functioning, while following the science.” The UK’s Health Security Agency (UKHSA) on Wednesday cut the 10-day self-isolation period for vaccinated and unvaccinated people in England who have tested positive for coronavirus from 10 days to seven if they get the all-clear from lateral flow tests. The World Health Organization has described the decisions to cut isolation and quarantine periods as part of a delicate balancing act between controlling the transmission of the virus and keeping national economies up and running. “It is a trade-off between the science and being absolutely perfect in what you try to do, but then having the minimal disruption you can possibly have,” Michael Ryan, the WHO emergencies director, said. “Governments are struggling to find that balance.” The Irish government on Friday cut the isolation period to seven days from 10 for people who have tested positive but received a booster vaccine or been infected within the previous three months. With the Omicron variant accounting for 92% of all infections in Ireland, now running at more than double their previous record, the country’s chief medical officer also urged people to keep social contacts as low as possible before New Year’s Eve. Spain, where infection numbers have increased fivefold in a month, cut its isolation period for people who have tested positive to seven days from 10 on Wednesday after a meeting between the health minister, Carolina Darias, and regional health chiefs. The quarantine period for close contacts of people who have tested positive was also reduced to seven days. The prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the country needed to strike “a balance” between public health, mental health and economic growth. Portugal followed suit on Thursday, cutting its mandatory isolation period for people who test positive but are asymptomatic from 10 days to seven, after health experts urged the government to rethink amid concerns the country could become paralysed. “This decision is aligned with guidelines from other countries and is a result of a technical and weighted consideration, given the incubation period of the now predominant variant, Omicron,” the DGS health authority said in a statement. Greece reduced its isolation period for coronavirus patients further, to five days from 10, after the country set a fourth consecutive daily record of new infections. “The evidence we have from Omicron is encouraging,” said the health minister, Thanos Plevris. Members of the public who come into contact with a confirmed Covid case will have to quarantine for five days and then get a test, but quarantine will not be required for those who have already received a booster shot. Italy chose a different course, leaving its isolation period untouched but scrapping quarantine for those coming into contact with someone who has tested positive providing they have had a booster shot, recently recovered or been vaccinated. They will have to wear a more protective FFP2 (equivalent to KN95 or N95 in other regions) mask for 10 days and take a test within five days since the contact with the positive person – but only if they are showing symptoms. “I think it is reasonable to apply different rules to those citizens who have followed the government’s indications, taking two doses and then the booster,” said the health secretary, Andrea Costa. Italy, too, has registered record infection numbers this week. Germany’s Der Spiegel reported this week that the health minister, Karl Lauterbach, favoured shortening quarantine periods amid fears the country would soon grind to a halt given how many people are having to self-isolate protectively. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases recommends that infected people and their contacts in Germany, where case numbers have recently started to rise, quarantine for 14 days, even if they are fully vaccinated or recovered. In France, which this week set a new European record for daily infections, media have reported that the government’s HAS health advisory body is due to make a formal recommendation on the question on Friday. France operates a seven-day isolation period, and a 17-day quarantine for people living in the same household as someone who has tested positive.

12/31/2021,"A second Newcastle fixture in the space of four days has been postponed because of Covid and injuries in Eddie Howe’s squad. Newcastle were due to play at Southampton on Sunday but the Premier League has confirmed that the game, like Thursday’s at Everton, cannot go ahead because of a shortage of players.  Howe is without a number of squad members because of Covid, and injuries suffered by Callum Wilson, Ryan Fraser and Allan Saint-Maximin against Manchester United last Monday exacerbated the manager’s problems. “Newcastle United continue to have ongoing Covid-19 cases and injuries that led to their match against Everton FC being called off earlier this week,” the league said. “The board accepted the postponement application as the club does not have the required number of players available for the match (13 outfield players and one goalkeeper).” The club are second bottom of the league with one win this season.

12/31/2021,"Germany’s leading coronavirus expert has expressed optimism that his country could expect a “relatively normal” winter in 2022, after data from other countries firmed up the impression that infections with the Omicron variant of Covid-19 could be milder than Delta. Christian Drosten, who heads up the institute of virology at Berlin’s Charité hospital, told public broadcaster ZDF that Omicron had the potential to take the pandemic into an “endemic situation”, where the virus that has brought the world to a standstill could be more comparable to a common cold or flu virus.  “Of course, it is a good situation if you have a virus that no longer makes you ill but transmits easily so that it can seek out and find all of the immunity gaps among the population and still trigger regular updates in immunity,” Drosten said. Nonetheless, the coronavirus expert said he expected indoor mask-wearing mandates and an updated top-up dose of a vaccine to be necessary to protect vulnerable people over the course of the coming year. Germany was at a particular disadvantage because it had a higher percentage than other European countries of people who had neither attained immunity through vaccination or infection with the virus, Drosten said. “We have too many unvaccinated people in Germany, especially over 60. And those are of course seriously at risk.” In his first new year’s address, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will urge those citizens who have sat out the vaccination drive so far to change their minds and take the jab. “It’s clear to all of us: the pandemic is not over”, Scholz said in a pre-released transcript of a speech that will be televised on Friday evening. “I appeal to all of you: let yourself be vaccinated.” As of Friday, 71.2% of Germany is considered fully vaccinated, the lowest vaccination rate in western Europe other than that of the UK and Switzerland. After days of sinking infection rates, Germany’s disease control agency reported an increased seven-day incidence for every 100,000 people of 214.9, with 41,270 new infections and 323 deaths reported in the last 24 hours. A reduction in testing over the festive period means the real number of cases could be higher. The number of confirmed Omicron cases in Germany has been rising rapidly, though slightly more slowly than in countries that have recorded a doubling of cases every two to three days. Omicron is especially widespread in Germany’s northernmost states and city-states, which is likely to be as a reult of their proximity to Denmark and the Netherlands. In the city of Bremen, the infectious variant was already the dominant type of the virus in the week 20-26 December, making up 64.7% of total Covid cases. As a result of Omicron’s spread, Germanywas expected to ease travel restrictions from countries hit especially hard by the variant, and it was reported on Thursday that South Africa and the UK are to be taken off the Robert Koch Institute’s red list as of 4 January, meaning travellers coming from those countries would no longer be required to enter a two-week quarantine.",News/World news,Germany buoyed by data from abroad amid Omicron spread,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/31/germany-buoyed-by-data-from-abroad-amid-omicron-spread

12/31/2021,"The year began with a counting up of the damage after the catastrophic extreme weather events of 2020, from fires to floods. Looking at the US alone, California more than doubled its previous annual wildfire record with more than 1.7m hectares (4.1m acres) burned and Nasa concluded that 2020 had been the joint hottest year on record. The US’s Noaa and the UK Met Office put it in close second to 2016.  And 2021 – the year that would see the crucial UN climate summit held in Glasgow in November – was not showing signs of being much better. The continent of Africa had its warmest January on record, while torrential rains fell in Malaysia, leading to the evacuation of 50,000 people and the death of at least six. Meanwhile in Turkey there were fears that Istanbul would run out of water following the most severe drought in a decade. But there were small steps of progress on other fronts. Within hours of becoming president, Joe Biden announced that the US would be rejoining the Paris agreement. The Israeli company StoreDot announced that car batteries that could be fully charged in five minutes had been produced in a Chinese factory for the first time. In my view, we’ve already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis and we can’t wait any longer. We see it with our own eyes, we feel it, we know it in our bones, and it’s time to act. Joe Biden And in the UK a plan to reintroduce white-tailed eagles to the east of the country was, unusually, led by farmers, who said they wanted to “inspire people with nature and drive wider nature recovery”. The internationally renowned scientist James Hansen waded into the UK’s row over plans for a new coalmine in Cumbria, saying it showed “contemptuous disregard for the future of young people”. A few days earlier, nine activists had announced that they were in a tunnel under London’s Euston station, dug secretly beneath a tent, in order to protest against the high-speed rail link the UK government was in the process of building. A historic wave of winter weather hit the eastern US and Texas, with nearly 10 million people without power at the storm’s peak, and millions without water after pipes burst; it was later assessed to have been the most costly winter storm event on record. In an amazing rewilding operation in Indonesia, 10 rescued orangutans were returned to the wild. Helicopters were used to ferry the critically endangered apes deep into the forest. And in Madagascar scientists found what is believed to be the smallest reptile on Earth. Brookesia nana, a nano-chameleon, has a body the size of a sunflower seed, just 13.5mm long. New York was lit up by news that dolphins had come to play in the East River – validation of a long-term clean-up of the river which had cost the city $45m. Further north, in the Midway Atoll wildlife refuge in the North Pacific, the “oldest wild bird in history”, 70-year-old Wisdom the Laysan albatross, hatched another chick. Banded by biologist Chandler Robbins in 1956, Wisdom has outlived a number of partners (albatrosses normally mate for life). On the other side of the planet, Australia was being hit by horrendous floods, with thousands forced to flee rising waters in New South Wales, and the insurance industry facing millions of dollars in claims. The same region, meanwhile, was also battling a mouse plague, with horrifying footage showing the ground moving as the rodents took over. In the US, Deb Haaland was confirmed as the first ever indigenous cabinet secretary, as she took over the environment department. The huge surge in renewable energy around the world continued, with China announcing that it had built windfarms with a staggering total capacity of almost 100GW in 2020 – an increase of nearly 60% on 2019. But Climate Action 100, launching the first ever benchmark for tracking corporate progress on climate change, found that only a handful of the big polluters were taking serious action. A landmark legal decision by the German supreme constitutional court found that the government’s climate protection measures were insufficient to protect future generations. The government promised it would take action on what one of the young activists who had brought the case called “a huge win for the climate movement”. In the UK meanwhile, the coroner who oversaw the sad case of a young girl, Ella Kissi-Debrah, who died after an asthma attack in 2013, published a report which called for the lowering of legally binding maximum levels of particulate air pollution in the UK. And in the US, a two-day summit on climate change was wound up with promises on all sides, including one from the US to cut its greenhouse gases by 50-52% by 2030. The country also pledged to double financial aid to help other countries with their targets. “Is it enough? No,” said John Kerry, Biden’s climate envoy, who had earlier struck a deal to cooperate with China on climate change. “But it’s the best we can do today and proves we can start to move.” The shifts came against the background of a troubling development however, as scientists concluded that the warm Atlantic current linked to severe and abrupt changes in the climate in the past was now at its weakest in at least 1,600 years. The current is known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc). Huge sandstorms in China turned the skies over Beijing yellow for several days, while Cyclone Seroja brought heavy rain and strong winds to Western Australia, with some locations seeing their highest ever daily rainfall. A Dutch court ordered Royal Dutch Shell to cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 in an unprecedented ruling that will have huge implications for the energy industry and other polluting multinationals. The decision came just as the International Energy Agency published Net Zero by 2050, a landmark report which stated that exploitation and development of new oil and gas fields would have to stop this year, and no new coal-fired power stations could be built if the world wanted to stay within safe limits of global heating and meet the goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Meanwhile in Australia the federal court found that the environment minister, Sussan Ley, had a duty of care to protect young people from the climate crisis, in what lawyers said was “the first time in the world” such a duty of care had been recognised. In France, the minister for ecological transition delighted and appalled people in equal measure with the announcement that the new climate law would take meat off the menu once a week in schools. Turkey was hit by “sea snot” – a blanket of mucus-like stuff that was silting up the coasts, created as a result of warm temperatures and agricultural run-off that encouraged phytoplankton to grow. But in California, after a short and late rainy season, the governor was declaring an impending drought emergency in 41 of 58 counties. One of the most extraordinary and powerful heatwaves ever experienced by North America hit the west coast in June and did not go away. Caused by what meteorologists called a “dome of high pressure”, the heatwave extended from California – worsening the drought even as the first wildfires of the season began – all the way up to Canada, where temperatures rose up to 118F (46.6C), shattering all previous records. “This is the beginning of a permanent emergency,” the governor of Washington state said. Other parts of the world also saw scorching temperatures. Both Europe and Asia had their second warmest Junes on record, while Africa and New Zealand had the warmest June ever recorded. But efforts to fight back continued too. Poland announced it would shut down Bełchatów, Europe’s most polluting power plant (although only in 2036). The City of London said it would be creating a heat network and digging boreholes for one of the UK’s largest low-carbon heating systems. Sri Lanka braced itself for disaster after the MV X-Press Pearl, a ship carrying toxic chemicals, caught fire off the coast and sank. Meanwhile China was fixating on a herd of elephants that had trekked 300 miles into the city of Kunming. The average global surface temperature for July was the hottest since records began in 1880, with Death Valley in California registering 54.4C (130F). As the US heatwaves and droughts worsened, India, China and Europe were being hit by catastrophic floods. Torrential downpours on India’s west coast led to 115 deaths, while Henan province in China saw a year’s worth of rain – 604mm – in a single day. Horrifying videos showed the waters rising in subways, while hundreds of thousands were forced to evacuate. And in Germany rows broke out when it emerged that a flood early-warning system had failed to work, after torrents of rainwater tore through villages and towns, leaving more than a hundred people dead. Meanwhile the Australian government continued to fight attempts to have the Great Barrier Reef declared “in danger”, with local politicians saying they feared for the impact the declaration would have on jobs. In the UK, the water company Southern Water was fined a record £90m after a six-year investigation found evidence that it had deliberately poured untreated sewage into the sea in order to avoid the cost of upgrading infrastructure. And, to top off a gloomy month for the planet, new data showed that the melting of Greenland was surging, with the amount of ice vanishing in a single day enough to cover the whole of Florida in 5cm of water, according to researchers. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change delivered its starkest warning to the world yet, concluding that climate change was unequivocally caused by human activities, and warning that some of the impacts were now inevitable and “irreversible”. As the heat continued, wildfires broke out in the Mediterranean, where the Greek prime minister described them as the country’s “greatest ecological disaster in decades”, and across more than 9m hectares of forests in Siberia. Meanwhile floods and landslides hit Japan, where more than a million were evacuated from their homes, and also Turkey, Colombia, and Tennessee in the US, where a record-breaking deluge swept through homes and roads. Rain fell on the highest point of the Greenland ice sheet for the first time on record. A Swedish company shipped the world’s first customer delivery of “green steel” – made without using coal – as solar power outstripped coal in Australia for the first time when, for a fleeting moment, more electricity was generated by solar power. In the UK, Extinction Rebellion swung back into action, blocking London Bridge and Oxford Circus, pouring red paint in entrances at the City of London and locking on outside the Science Museum over its sponsorship deal with the oil giant Shell. “Blah blah blah” was what Greta Thunberg called the promises from global leaders around the world to tackle climate change, pointing out that carbon emissions were still on track to rise 16% by 2030. As Cop26 drew nearer, and following the summer of record-breaking fires, heatwaves and floods, politicians everywhere were under increasing pressure to improve their offers. A US/EU deal to reduce methane emissions felt like a good contribution. A new protest movement launched in the UK, as Insulate Britain demonstrators began sitting on motorways to demand climate action in the form of insulation for the country’s housing stock. In Scotland, as preparations sped up, one man built an ark on a hillside, telling the planning committee when it asked if it was a permanent structure: “It’s not permanent in the same way that humanity won’t be if we don’t take action on the climate.” In a painful irony, new data revealed that the wildfires were themselves releasing record-breaking amounts of carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, an energy crisis was breaking across the world, with sky-high gas prices in Europe and pressure on electricity and coal supplies in China. China hosted the Kunming conference on biodiversity and announced a $233m (£170m) fund to protect biodiversity in developing countries. We shall take the development of an ecological civilisation as our guide to coordinate the relationship between man and nature. Xi Jinping With just days to go before Cop26, Australia, one of the countries most notorious for holding out against climate action, published its plan for how it would reduce carbon emissions, but it was called “a scam” containing no detail and no modelling. Elsewhere, however, signs of change were palpable, with a series of plans announced at the Middle East Green Initiative Summit, led by the United Arab Emirates which will be hosting Cop28 in two years’ time. A Tesla became the first ever battery-powered car to top Europe’s sales chart. And in the UK, the government was forced by a near rebellion to U-turn and place a duty on water companies to reduce sewage discharges. In the US, one senator gained global notoriety: Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat, was holding out against his own party for huge cuts to President Biden’s climate change plans. For a brief moment, it looked as if Biden would have to go to Cop26 with no legislative progress at home. Cop26 was under way at last, after two years of pandemic, delays, worries, criticisms and negotiations. World leaders gathered for the first two days and were exhorted by David Attenborough to be “motivated by hope rather than fear”. Biden had finally got his bill passed, but the UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, put a dampener on events by making his speech and then hopping into a private jet to make the short journey to London. The first week saw an onslaught of deals on methane, deforestation, coal, the ambition to stick to 1.5C of warming and finance, with hundreds of the world’s biggest banks and pension funds with assets worth $130tn committing themselves to limiting greenhouse gas emissions. By the end of the second week of hard negotiation, the summit’s president, Alok Sharma, had cajoled countries into a deal including a ratchet mechanism that asked every country to upgrade its emission reduction plans in time for the next Cop in Egypt in a year’s time, and each year thereafter. However, many were dismayed that the deal did not include the loss and damage facility that most of the world had asked for, to help developing countries in particular pay for the impacts of the climate crisis already being felt. Beyond the summit, rain storms hit British Columbia in Canada, earlier battered by the summer’s heatwaves, broke up roads and led to a state of emergency. Out in the oceans one of the rarest animals in the world was glimpsed: the mythical white sperm whale, seen surfacing for a moment, from the waters off Jamaica. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) announced in the middle of the month that it had recognised a new Arctic temperature record: the summer of 2020 had seen the Russian town of Verkhoyansk hit with an all-time high of 38°C (100.4°F). Floods swept Queensland, Australia, with up to 180mm of rain falling in 24 hours in some parts of the state. The UK was hit by Storm Arwen and Storm Barra. Heavy rains fell in Iraq, leading to serious flooding and displacement. And tornadoes ripped through North America, with at least 70 deaths in Kentucky in what was described as the “most devastating tornado event” in the state’s history, only to be followed, by the end of the month, by record-breaking temperatures and snowfall. EO Wilson, who died on 26 December, had warned many times that humans could not continue to use the land and resources of the planet in the way they did. The biologist was caught up in controversies at times during his career. Nevertheless, his warning that “we live in a delusional state” if we do not understand the burden that the western way of life imposes on Earth, rings true even now. If all mankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed 10,000 years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos.

12/31/2021,"One in 25 people in England had Covid last week, rising to one in 15 in London, official figures have revealed. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics, based on swabs collected from randomly selected households, an estimated 4% of people in the community in England had Covid in the week ending 23 December – about 2,024,700 people. The week before, about one in 35 people in England were estimated to have had Covid.  The study revealed infections have increased across all regions of the UK as the Omicron variant continues to fuel record numbers. “The highest rates of infections were seen in London, where one in 15 would have tested positive, and the lowest in the north-east of England, where one in 45 would have tested positive for Covid-19,” the report notes. Infection levels also rose in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in the most recent week, with the latest estimates suggesting that for all three countries about one in 40 people had Covid in the week ending 23 December. The study also reveals that Omicron is now the dominant variant in England and Scotland. “Infection levels have continued to increase across the UK, with England’s increase driven largely by London, which has the highest rate of infection seen in this survey,” said Sarah Crofts, the head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 Infection Survey. “Omicron is now the dominant variant in both England and Scotland, and has been growing rapidly in Northern Ireland and Wales,” she added. “We’ve also seen infections rise in all age groups, with school-aged children and young adults seeing the highest rates.”",News/World news,One in 25 people in England had Covid last week,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/31/one-in-25-people-in-england-had-covid-last-week
