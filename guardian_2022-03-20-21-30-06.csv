3/20/2022,"When Byungsu Kim appeared for his sentencing hearing on Zoom from the Santa Ana jail in California, his jaw was wired shut. The 46-year-old South Korean national had been in prison for more than two years on two different continents. According to the US government, he was an “international succulent trafficker”, perhaps the most notorious houseplant poacher in the world. Kim had already pleaded guilty to taking more than 3,700 wild dudleya plants from California state parks and attempting to export them to South Korea. “All these things happened because of my lack of knowledge,” Kim now told the judge through a translator, according to Courthouse News, speaking with difficulty through his injured jaw, the result of an assault by another inmate. “If I had known a little bit more about America, if I had known a little bit more about the laws in America, I would not have done this stupid wrongdoing.” The American prosecutors argued that Kim’s claims of ignorance were ludicrous. He had already fled prosecution once, escaping on foot from the US into Mexico in 2019. He had later been arrested in South Africa for illegally harvesting more than 2,000 rare succulents, including some more than a hundred years old. And while prosecutors could not prove that Kim had stolen succulents on his more than 50 previous trips to the US, they suspected, based on export records, that he might have taken upwards of 120,000 wild plants since 2013. Kim’s crimes, the prosecutors argued, were motivated not by ignorance, but by “insatiable greed”. Law enforcement officials have little information about how Kim, a South Korean farmer who studied agriculture in college, ended up on the run from US agents. The details in court documents are sparse: he is separated from his wife and has two daughters, ages six and 16. Kim’s American attorney, Jeremy Lessem, wrote in court documents that his client had hoped to use the plants he had taken from other countries to grow succulents on his own farm. Kim had grown up poor, Lessem wrote, and saw rare plants as a way to earn extra money “that he could use to pay for the education of his two girls”. “Harvesting plants on public land in South Korea was often ignored or met with monetary fines,” Lessem wrote. What is clear is that when Kim flew into LAX from Mexico in October 2018, he and his two assistants, Youngin Back and Bong Jun Kim, were fully on the radar of California’s environmental cops. Game wardens of the state’s fish and wildlife department observed Kim renting a minivan and filling it with empty backpacks, plastic bins and boxes. The three men later began a two-day drive up the California coast, according to court records. Wardens surveilled the trio for more than a week as they stealthily navigated around state parks on California’s remote northern coast, filling their backpacks with dudleya, an attractive local succulent. The men dropped off their haul at the Secret Garden Nursery in Vista, California, then returned north for two days to dig up more succulents in Mendocino, this time communicating with handheld radios. The wardens waited while Kim, who used the alias “Neo”, obtained documents to have the southern California nursery legally export 259 pounds of dudleya. He claimed that all the plants had originated in San Diego. They waited when the men transported dozens of plant boxes to an export facility in Compton. Then, as Kim and his companions prepared to drive away, the wardens made the arrests. The boxes Kim had tried to export contained more than 600 pounds of succulents, or 3,715 individual plants, more than double what the export documents described. California game wardens started going after plant thieves in 2018 after succulent thefts exploded in both California and the Western Cape of South Africa – regions with similar Mediterranean-style climates, which made them succulent poaching hotspots. The public response was “overwhelmingly positive”, said Captain Patrick Foy, a spokesman for California’s fish and wildlife department. The reaction to poaching enforcement is sometimes negative, but when it came to succulents, “people were furious”, Foy said. It probably helped that the plants being taken were popular, with widespread name recognition. Dudleya farinosa, the type of dudleya most sought after by California poachers, is particularly “charismatic” to humans, experts say. They boast the precise mix of qualities that Americans demand from crime victims: they are pretty and small, very fragile and yet curiously resilient. Their common name, “liveforevers”, is said to have been given to them by 19th-century European naturalists, who were shocked to find samples of the plant still alive after months-long ocean voyages. Dudleya do not thrive in domestic captivity. “Treat them like a petunia, and they’ll be dead,” said Stephen McCabe, a California succulent expert. The wardens found allies in California environmentalists, who passed along tips, identified poached plants and served as expert witnesses. While some dudleya are quite common, many species grow in only a few places, and some were already threatened by two of California’s most persistent dangers: wildfire and luxury development, said McCabe. Plant advocates warned that some species of dudleya were so rare that, if they were targeted by poachers, they might go extinct, causing broader damage to entire ecosystems. “It’s not hard to imagine a hillside denuded of dudleya that then sloughs off into the ocean because it doesn’t have any plants to hold it there,” said Nick Jensen, the conservation project manager at the California Native Plant Society. Kim and his assistants were charged with conspiracy and with violating a California law against destruction or removal of plant material on public land. Wardens estimated the stolen dudleya were worth $600,000 on the South Korean market. The California state charges were only the beginning. The US attorney’s environmental crimes unit wanted to make an example out of the case. “In our view, a major smuggler who needed to be stopped,” said Matthew O’Brien, the assistant US attorney who prosecuted the federal case. In May 2019, when Kim learned about the federal charges, he fled. His passport had been confiscated, but Kim had gone to the South Korean embassy in Los Angeles, said he had lost his passport and been issued a new one. He crossed the border with Mexico on foot, and flew from there to China, then back to South Korea. Five months later, Kim re-emerged, this time on the other end of the globe. South African investigators caught him illegally harvesting more than 2,000 rare conophytum succulents, including one more than 250 years old and dozens more than a century old. Shortly after taking on the case, prosecutor Anne Heeramun received a call from an American fish and wildlife officer working as an embassy attache: her new suspect was already a fugitive from justice in the US. The South African prosecutors highlighted the “severity” and “brutality” of Kim’s “crime against nature”, and how stealing “large, ancient ‘mother’ plants” put the entire species at risk, especially during times of serious drought. “The collection of these plants is an ecological tragedy,” they wrote. Kim pleaded guilty to the charges in South Africa and paid a large fine. After a year in South African prison, he was extradited to the US in October 2020. His case, like similar ones before it, drew significant media attention. Coverage of succulent smuggling often focused on the market demand for succulents in Asia, with experts pointing to the growing middle classes in South Korea and China, and the popularity of succulents as status-markers for hipsters and housewives. Wild plants had particular cachet in Asia, California game wardens suggested: “It’s like having a Fendi bag on Rodeo Drive,” one warden told a student journalist. “A dudleya farinosa from the wild bluffs of Mendocino, California, especially a five-headed one, is apparently a super cool thing to have.” Over the years, that narrative has been challenged. Early discussions about plant poaching had been full of “stereotypes and tropes” about an “Asian super-consumer”, motivated by vague “east Asian cultural traditional practices”, said Jared Margulies, a political ecologist at the University of Alabama. But when Margulies investigated the market in Seoul, he found no dudleya for sale at the stores where “hipsters and housewives” shopped for plants. There was also a botanical red flag: dudleya were finicky houseplants, likely to die quickly – an odd choice for the mass consumer. In fact, Margulies found, the reason dudleya were smuggled to South Korea was not because of local demand, but because of its high-end greenhouses, where rough wild dudleya could be pampered for a few years, growing larger and more lush, before being sold for elite prices on the global market. Many of the plants trafficked to South Korea probably ended up being resold elsewhere, Margulies concluded, to collectors in South Korea, China, Europe and the US. Margulies’ research would have a major impact on Kim. As an expert witness in Kim’s case, he reduced the government’s estimate of the market value of Kim’s wild succulent haul – from more than $600,000 to somewhere between $100,000 and $255,000. Federal sentencing guidelines closely track the value of stolen goods. US prosecutors asked that Kim be sentenced to three years in prison as a deterrent to other smugglers. Lessem, Kim’s attorney, argued that he had suffered enough. He had contracted Covid-19 in prison, Lessem said, and lived in fear of contracting it again. His assault by another inmate, which left him with his jaw wired shut, was part of the toll of being imprisoned in a country where he did not speak the language. Expressing some agreement with Lessem’s arguments, the judge sentenced Kim to two years, at the lower end of the guideline. The Bureau of Prisons further credited Kim’s prison time in South Africa towards his sentence, a justice department spokesperson said. But that did not mean that Kim was released. Instead, his federal time served, Kim was transported in late January to the custody of the Del Norte county sheriff, in Crescent City, a remote northern California town of about 6,000 people. Kim is now facing two additional cases in state court, one for his original succulent thefts, and one for fleeing the country during that prosecution, according to his new attorney, Joseph Futrell, who said neither he nor his client would comment. In California, dudleya smuggling has dramatically reduced in recent years, but South Africa has seen a new surge in “floral matters”, Heeramun said. This time, it’s locals facing prison time. Foreigners are still driving the succulent trade, she said, but they have responded to prosecution by “using locals to do the gathering and the picking”. One way to prevent the poaching of rare plants is simply to cultivate as many of the coveted plants as possible, thus reducing the market value of stolen plants. But environmental activists also continue to endorse tough criminal punishments. In 2021, the California Native Plant Society helped pass a state law specifically criminalizing dudleya poaching, with fines of up to $500,000 and six months in prison. “It’s very sad if people are compelled to come to California, or anywhere, and remove a wild organism from its natural habitat, and they end up in jail,” Jensen said. “It’s just a sad story all the way around that I’m concerned, for the plant and the people.”",News/US news,‘Crime against nature’: the rise and fall of the world’s most notorious succulent thief,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/20/california-succulent-smuggling-dudleya
3/20/2022,"Hunter Biden and Anthony Fauci will be prime targets of Senate Republicans should the party win control in November, a senior senator said. Asked by the Hill what he would want to investigate should he control a committee with subpoena power, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said: “Like everything? It’s like a mosquito in a nudist colony, it’s a target-rich environment.” Fauci, 81, has served seven presidents as head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. He has played a lead role in the response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 970,000 in the US. He has become a hate figure on the political right, even leading to threats against his security. Fauci suggested this week he could soon retire, telling ABC News: “I’d love to spend more time with my wife and family. That would really be good.” But high-profile clashes with Republicans including Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky have shown Fauci is likely to remain a prime target for GOP attacks. Paul is line to chair the Senate health committee. In one headline-making clash with Fauci, in July 2021, Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser told the hectoring senator: “You do not know what you are talking about.” Earlier this year, Paul said: “If we win in November, if I’m chairman of a committee, if I have subpoena power, we’ll go after every one of [Fauci’s] records.” Johnson, who has advanced Covid conspiracy theories and advocated unproven treatments, told the Hill: “There’s so much more in terms of what happened with our federal health agencies that we need to explore.” Hunter Biden, 52, is the president’s surviving son. His business activities, particularly regarding Ukraine, have long been a Republican priority. Donald Trump was impeached for the first time for withholding military aid to Kyiv while seeking dirt on the Bidens. A laptop once belonging to Hunter Biden has re-emerged as the subject of scrutiny, particularly after the New York Times this week reported on his tax affairs. In 2020, Johnson played a prominent role in a Republican investigation which counted Hunter Biden among its subjects. Democrats then won two run-offs in Georgia, to control the 50-50 Senate via the vote of the vice-president, Kamala Harris. Johnson will seek a third term in November but faces a tough fight in Wisconsin. “I’d kind of like to wrap that up,” he told the Hill of his investigation of Hunter Biden. “We’ve been trying to get his travel records for a couple of years now.” Other areas of likely Republican attack, the Hill said, included border security and immigration and the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. A spokesman for the Democratic Senate? Campaign Committee said Republicans were preparing to pursue a “toxic agenda”. Johnson returned to his nudist camp analogy. “I’ll be that mosquito,” he said. “Hard to tell what targets I might pick. They’ll all be juicy.”",News/US news,‘Mosquito in a nudist colony’: Republican Ron Johnson targets Fauci and Hunter Biden,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/20/mosquito-nudist-colony-republican-ron-johnson-fauci-hunter-biden
3/20/2022,"There is a fascinating tension in the British attitude to war and military matters. When he wrote about England in 1941, George Orwell said his home country was defined by the “gentleness” of its civilisation, and such a “hatred of war and militarism” that flag-waving and patriotic boasting were always the preserve of a small minority. Events over the past 40 or so years have perhaps proved him wrong: from time to time, a widely shared jingoism has been brought to the surface of our national life, focused either on actual conflict – as happened when Britain fought for the Falkland Islands – or some hare-brained proxy for it, such as Brexit. But there is something about Orwell’s portrayal of people with an innate distaste for bellicose posturing that still rings true, across all the countries of the United Kingdom. Among certain politicians, by contrast, there is far too little of that kind of thinking. Over the past three weeks, the unimaginable awfulness of what has happened in Ukraine and the fact that Vladimir Putin’s invasion is such a matter of moral clarity has encouraged a lot of rhetoric and posturing that has been shrill, banal and full of a misplaced machismo. The war, says one Tory MP, is Boris Johnson’s “Falklands moment”. The vocal Conservative backbencher Tobias Ellwood – a former soldier in the Royal Green Jackets, and now an active reservist – insists that the west’s response shows “we’ve lost our appetite, we’ve lost our confidence to stand up: to stand tall”. And while he and other Tory MPs – including zealous believers in Britain breaking from the EU, suddenly holding forth about the urgent need for international unity – have been making sense-defying demands for Nato to impose a no-fly zone, some of the cabinet have come out with their own very unsettling pronouncements, seemingly thinking that if Putin talks tough, they should talk tougher. When Sajid Javid was asked about the recent Russian attack on a Ukrainian military base only about 10 miles from the country’s border with Poland, we saw the strange spectacle of the health secretary apparently embracing the prospect of nuclear war: “Let’s be very clear … if a single Russian toecap steps into Nato territory, there will be war with Nato.” With the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s spring statement arriving on Wednesday, a familiar sound is getting louder: Conservatives demanding more money for the military, even though the UK currently spends the fifth-largest annual sum in the world (after the US, China, India and Russia). For well over a decade now, most Tories have been united in the belief that just about every public service is best cut to the bone and subjected to endless lectures about inefficiency. But defence is suddenly a glaring exception: Labour may have credibly identified £13bn of departmental waste since 2010, but that seems to be no barrier to calls for a spending rise of about 25%. If you want a flavour of the thinking at work, a good place to start is a recent piece in the Sunday Telegraph by the former Brexit minister David Frost. He reckons that “western muscle memory is returning and we are getting back to the principles that helped us to win the cold war”. He says: “We are going to have to spend more on defence and that will mean tough choices.” We all know what those are likely to be: the price of our supposedly central role in a reshaped world may well be paid in social care, education, children’s services and all the rest. Though he would presumably express opposition to cuts elsewhere, Keir Starmer has joined in the calls for more military cash, which snugly fits the “I’m not Jeremy Corbyn” narrative of his leadership. Given Starmer’s apparent determination to follow the example set by his New Labour forebears, and Tony Blair’s recent offer to help his old party with policy advice, we should be listening hard to what the latter has to say. Last week, he published an essay about the Ukraine crisis. Its most sobering passage ran thus: “When Putin is threatening Nato and stoking fear of nuclear conflict, there is something incongruous about our repeated assurance to him that we will not react with force.” Naturally enough, Blair also wants more money for the armed forces. “We are awake,” he says. “Now we must act.” This the same register he used at the start of the “war on terror”, when he talked about shaken kaleidoscopes and the need to “reorder this world around us”. Hearing it again is not exactly reassuring. As is usually the case, Boris Johnson’s tone swings between the serious and utterly crass. At this weekend’s Tory spring conference, he and his colleagues parroted the familiar argument that the war demands an end to “woke” ideas and criticisms of British history (which actually sounds like a milquetoast version of Putinism), and he made that grotesque comparison between Ukrainians and Brexit voters. When caught in a more sensible mood, he has also counselled a measure of caution and level-headedness. “It’s very important that we don’t get locked into any kind of logic of direct conflict between the west and Russia because that’s how Putin wants to portray it … as a fight between him and Nato,” he told The Economist last week. “It isn’t. This is about the Ukrainian people and their right to defend themselves.” This line was repeated on Sunday. But around him, there still swirl very dangerous currents. Back in the 1980s, as Ronald Reagan speculated about a limited nuclear war in Europe and we were warned about the prospect of an accidental nuclear exchange, I grew up with a cold sense of fear. Now a new generation has to face not just those same anxieties, but the existential threat of the climate emergency and the prospect of regular global pandemics. Not surprisingly, there is a growing crisis in childhood mental health: a sign not just of failing public services, but arguably of a system of power and politics that does not ease such visceral fears, instead endlessly inflaming them. In a situation as fragile as this, belligerent talk can have terrifying consequences. It also tends to highlight the way Westminster’s armchair generals neglect their duty of care to their own citizens. I am now having conversations with my 12-year-old daughter about the prospect of nuclear annihilation. I tell her it’ll be all right, but her – and my – fears are hardly helped by the reckless words we sporadically hear from some of those supposedly in charge. Yes, the world has clearly changed. Even if liberal values are always damaged and compromised by people in power, that does not mean that they are not still the best hope we have, something Putin’s passage into something close to fascism makes plain. But those same values – not to mention the delicate stuff of geopolitics and diplomacy – demand nuance and calm. Moreover, there is one thing we overlook at our peril: that however much we spend on our military, our social fabric needs to be resilient and secure enough to cope with a new reality of constant shocks and disruptions, and at the moment it is anything but. In this dreadful moment, these seem to be things in danger of being forgotten. I worry about that. I think we all should.

3/20/2022,"Pandemic restrictions are being lifted with alacrity across Europe despite many countries experiencing a record surge in coronavirus cases and concerns about the failure to vaccinate many people considered vulnerable to the disease. In Germany most pandemic controls will be lifted on Sunday after a heated parliamentary debate on Friday which led to both houses of parliament voting in favour. That was despite cases in Germany reaching a new daily record of almost 300,000 on Friday – a seven-day incidence rate of 1,706 cases per 100,000 residents – and a majority of the population expressing concern that the relaxations were coming too soon. Germany has been recording daily deaths of over 200 for several weeks. Cases are also climbing in Austria, the Netherlands, Switzerland and France. In Austria authorities said they had little choice other than to reintroduce a face mask mandate for indoor spaces in the light of a hefty rise in cases to 3,600 per 100,000 inhabitants. The health minister, Johannes Rauch, announced on Friday that from the middle of this week medical FFP2 masks will have to be worn again. Austria is at the same time considering reducing quarantine times due to an acute lack of nurses and other hospital staff as infections rise, leading to operations having to be postponed and a record number of resignations among medical staff. In France, most restrictions were lifted last Monday, including the obligation to wear a mask indoors, except on public transport, and to show a “Pass Vacinal” proving vaccine or recovery status. The number of new cases has risen by a quarter since last week, according to health authorities, and was at its highest along the Grand Est border region with Germany. French authorities said the situation in clinics remained stable and that both the number of patients in intensive care and the number of coronavirus fatalities were going down. During a four-hour presentation of his election programme on Thursday, the president, Emmanuel Macron, made scant reference to the pandemic. Meanwhile the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, warned against believing the virus had been conquered, as the World Health Organization said on Friday it was “far from over”. “Lately we are all dealing with the war in Ukraine and high prices,” Mitsotakis said in an Instagram post, having himself tested positive on Monday, “but the coronavirus is still very much with us.” A hotchpotch of rules are in place across the continent, with countries such as Italy and Spain, which were worst hit in the earliest stages of the pandemic in 2020, appearing to take the most cautious approach to loosening regulation. In Spain, face masks are still required in schools, restaurants, on public transport and in other indoor spaces, and 211,241 new Covid cases have been registered over the past two weeks. The numbers have been on the rise since last week, at around 446 cases per 100,000 over a seven-day period. But the proportion of intensive care beds occupied by Covid patients has fallen by just under 3% to 6.6% compared with a fortnight ago. Spain has one of the highest vaccination levels of any European country, with 92.3% over the age of 12 having had two jabs, while 51.3% have had three. The Spanish government has signalled its intention to end the mandatory use of masks in interior spaces soon, but said it was not yet ready to set a date. “It’s true that everything suggests we’re getting closer and closer to that, but for us, how we do it is as important as when we do it,” the health minister, Carolina Darias, said last week. Spain has lost at least 101,000 people to the virus. Italy announced plans last Thursday to gradually phase out its protection measures despite a rise in cases since the start of March, two years after the virus spread in the country to devastating effect, claiming over 157,000 lives. The easing of rules means that the requirement to show a health certificate to enter most public places, from theatres to restaurants, would be dropped. Mario Draghi, the Italian prime minister, said the government reserved the right to reintroduce restrictions if necessary, but said the country was now well placed to cope with the virus as almost 84% of Italians had received a jab. Meanwhile across Scandinavia, where almost all restrictions have been dropped, the number of registered infections has been falling considerably over weeks, following record rates seen in February. Some are sceptical, suggesting the fall might be linked to a lack of testing. But experts say Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland and Finland all boast high vaccine rates, giving them greater protection. In Germany, a vaccine mandate is still being debated due to vaccine rates that are considered too low, particularly among older people and well below the government’s own goal, at just under 76%. Olaf Scholz, the chancellor, used a regional election campaign event in Saarland on Friday to appeal to more Germans to get a jab. “We need to stick up for each other,” he said, fighting to be heard amid shouts from protesters from the Covid-sceptic Querdenker movement. “Where’s the solidarity, when it’s of no concern to you whether you are infecting other people or not? Freedom only functions when it means freedom for everyone,” he said. The German health minister, Karl Lauterbach, accused those who refuse a vaccination of “holding the rest of the country hostage”.",News/World news,Covid restrictions easing across Europe despite surge in cases,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/covid-restrictions-easing-across-europe-despite-surge-in-cases

Outside Shell’s headquarters in central London – and in full view of an enormous crowd – the British-Pakistani climate lawyer and activist made a statement by crossing a line of police tape and supergluing her hand to the pavement.

3/20/2022,"You can imagine how the prospect of turning 40 was particularly problematic for Simon Amstell. The film-maker and comedian, who started as a stand-up at 13 and was presenter of the cultish Popworld at 21, has always projected brilliant boyishness. When the dread birthday approached in 2019, he responded, he says, in entirely cliched fashion: he dyed his trademark mop of black curly hair blond and ran away to New York for a last-ditch adventure. When that didn’t work he resorted to the only thing that had properly helped him with depression in his 20s: he returned to Peru, where he had once taken the plant-based hallucinogen ayahuasca. There, over the course of a 10-day series of shamanic ceremonies in the rainforest, he found the answer to his anxieties. What happened? “Well,” he says, frequently punctuating his account with his wickedly high-pitched laugh, “during this one particular ceremony, I found that I excavated all the shame I’ve been carrying in my body by taking off all my clothes – unexpectedly. And then my finger, beyond my control, made its way towards my perineum [that generally unexplored no man’s land between anus and scrotum]. I had,” he recalls, with remembered delight, “a vision of the perineum becoming a new hole that you could enter. And when I poked my finger in, I started making loud orgasm sounds. I thought I could get away with it, because everyone else in the circle was having their own experience – crying and throwing up and so on – but eventually, near the end of the ceremony, everyone else was pretty much done. The chanting had all stopped. And the only sound was me having an orgasm.” He giggles at the memory. “The question I was being asked by the medicine was,” he says, “what is more important to you: shame or pleasure? I leaned deeply into the shame – and chose the pleasure.” Amstell is recounting this story in the back corner of The Sun and 13 Cantons, a pub in London’s Soho, which is hosting his favourite vegan kitchen, Tendril, as a pop-up. As his 2017 memoir Help revealed, he long ago developed a high-risk strategy for staying sane: he would expose all his deepest fears on stage, the place he always felt safest, and trust that people might laugh. The ayahuasca ceremony forms the basis of his latest standup tour, which was interrupted by the pandemic but will resume in May. Did what happened in Peru make equal sense back in London? “I arrived home with this feeling of tremendous excitement about the future,” he recalls. “And then, because of lockdown, the future paused. Luckily, somebody I met on the retreat was able to send me magic mushrooms. And so the healing was able to continue.” Did it not seem quite an extreme strategy against midlife fears? “I certainly didn’t see it that way. The really big risk to me was remaining depressed,” he says. He is confident the darkness is now behind him. One lasting habit is the need to dance every morning when he wakes up. “I’ve found it’s quite difficult to retain depression if you’re jumping around every morning like a lunatic.” The burst of creative looseness has been useful in different ways. Amstell has written two film scripts in the past couple of years, the first of which will go into production in September. “I realised during this pandemic that I love writing because it actually allows me to be somewhere else. I got to be in Miami losing my virginity, which was great.” Those scripts follow on from Amstell’s two previous films which, in different ways, showed he was far more than the wisecracking host of Never Mind the Buzzcocks, the role he perhaps remains best known for. The most recent of his movies, Benjamin, was a tender, clever romcom in which a cripplingly awkward alter ego, played by Colin Morgan, gets eventually to find love. The other, Carnage, made for the BBC in 2017, employed perfectly pitched Chris Morris-style satire to examine the systemic cruelties of our diet. Carnage is set in the year 2067 and features a cast of older characters in group therapy as they try to come to terms with their horrific carnivorous pasts. With our table suitably crowded with fabulous plates of smoked aubergine, and celeriac terrine and roasted cauliflower from Tendril’s kitchen, he evangelises his own journey to that particular awakening. He grew up in a Jewish family in Gants Hill in Essex where “meat eating was compulsory”. He can’t recall meeting a single vegetarian in his childhood. When he was about 25, he went to Thailand and came across a book about Buddhism called Taming the Monkey Mind. Though he suggests he was probably drunk when he read it, he was nevertheless persuaded to give up both meat and alcohol for good. A few years after that he watched the documentary Earthlings, about the innumerable ways that humans exploit animals. “I wasn’t really aware of the full horror of the dairy industry, for example,” he says. “And I decided it probably wasn’t that difficult to have milk – soya milk or oat milk – that hasn’t come out of the breast of a cow that has been forcibly impregnated and then repeatedly had her children stolen from her and killed.” His original plan for Carnage was to make it like a war crimes tribunal for cheese-eaters. But then he decided it would be more persuasive if it was more compassionate to those “ashamed of their former barbarity”. Did he get the response he wanted? “From lots of people,” he says. “Although the night after the film was released, my boyfriend and I went to a dinner party. These friends told us how much they had loved the film and then served up the broken legs of a chicken.” Amstell welcomes the fact he now has many more vegan allies. As well as his own film, he recommends that waverers watch The Game Changers which, among other things, argues that men who have a plant-based diet enjoy far better erections. Chatting with him is a bit like being in his audience. He is irresistibly confessional, and winningly eager to take you along for the ride. He learned that therapeutic trick at around the time of his bar mitzvah when, undone by his parents’ messy divorce and confused about his sexuality, (“I thought fear of being gay could be responsible for overpowering gay feelings”), he first walked out alone on to a stage. That impulse has evolved in his writing to something like continuous catharsis. His standup shows have, in part, been voyages around his relationship with his father (“He ejaculated and I’m alive, what more do I want?”) who found religion after he left the family home, and suggested therapy when Amstell told him he was gay. Happily, that is another aspect of Amstell’s life that appears to have evolved. For a long time, his father refused to watch him perform, saying it “wasn’t his thing”, but he did come along to the Palladium on the current tour. “He hadn’t been to see me for maybe seven or eight years,” says Amstell. “I don’t know if he laughed, but he seemed very happy and proud afterwards.” The onstage therapy appears to have worked in surprising ways. “I think what changes is your perspective on the other person,” he says. “If you’re feeling rage towards someone, it’s quite difficult to have a nice time. But if you can do some work with your therapist, or your shaman, you might let go of the rage. And then they show up as somebody else, not delightful maybe, but quite amenable.” When the lunch table is being cleared, we talk a bit about that very British mistrust of joy, which Amstell believes he might finally have conquered. “I remember being around 25, at this incredible party in someone’s very beautiful garden in Highgate,” he says, “and paper lanterns were being lit and everyone was dancing and it was all very cinematic. And the actual thought in my head was: ‘Everyone here is going to age and die.’” He laughs. “What was wrong with me? Well, depression, I guess.” If his experience in Peru has taught him anything, he says, it’s that life can also be lived in the affirmative. His film Benjamin was supposed to end with his character unable to commit to a future with his lover – but in the final scene the actor took over, and said “yes” where Amstell’s script had left him hanging. In the editing room he feared the payoff might be too cheesy but was persuaded to go with it. The fact is, he suggests, “we have these voices telling us that what is most true is the miserable part of our lives – but dancing around and having a nice time can be just as real”.

3/20/2022,"Russian performers and artists should not be made to pay the price for the war in Ukraine, according to one of the greatest Soviet-born ballet dancers. Mikhail Baryshnikov, the leading male classical dancer of the 1970s and 1980s, is not in favour of imposing heavy sanctions on fellow artists or sports stars. This month conductor Valery Gergiev and operatic soprano Anna Netrebko were among those who lost prestigious work in the west due to their ties to Vladimir Putin’s regime. “An open exchange in the arts is always a good thing,” Baryshnikov said. “I don’t think it’s right to put the weight of a country’s political decisions on the backs of artists, or athletes, who may have vulnerable family members in their home country. For people in those exposed positions, neutrality is a powerful statement. And if you want me to be specific, Daniil Medvedev should play Wimbledon.” Last week, the British sports minister Nigel Huddleston said the government would need assurances that any sportspeople entering the UK “are not supporters of Vladimir Putin”. Baryshnikov also said he feared Russia would soon make any positive future impossible for its young people. “Right now there’s a Rubicon for Russia to cross. Either it will find a way to end this current conflict and live in an open global society, or it will be thrust backwards with no hope of recovery,” he said. Baryshnikov, 74, who was born in Riga, Latvia, and who defected from the USSR to Canada in 1974, wants to improve people’s understanding of Russia. He has joined fellow prominent artists who are critical of the Kremlin to set up True Russia, a GoFundMe campaign to spread a better understanding of Russian culture and to raise money to help refugees. The campaign also involves the Russian writer Boris Akunin and leading Russian economist Sergei Guriev. Together they have issued a call to other people in exile, arguing they “do not have the right to remain idle”. “The hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who have lost their homes, their livelihoods, their loved ones, and even their lives are bearing the full brunt of the blow. But all of us who speak Russian and belong to the Russian cultural world feel the blow too. The very word Russian has become toxic,” says their campaign statement. Speaking from his home in New York, Baryshnikov said each well-known Russian must now make a choice. “It’s the individual decision of every artist whether they choose to speak out or not. For my part, I’ll quote his holiness, Pope Francis. ‘War is madness! Stop, please! Look at this cruelty!’ It’s clear to me to whom those words are directed. In simple terms, Russia is already back in Stalin’s time. The arts are collateral damage and it’s impossible to speculate how that will play out.” The ballet dancer, who had a promising career with the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad, now St Petersburg’s Mariinsky Ballet, when he left Russia, turned to the imagery of a classic Russian play to describe the plight of Russia’s younger generation. “In Chekhov’s play The Seagull Trigorin talks about feeling behind the times in relation to science and the modern world,” he said. “He feels like a poor old peasant who arrives at the train station only to see his train pulling out in a puff of steam. He runs to catch it, but knows that no matter what he does, the train will move further and further into the distance. Russia is dangerously close to this poor peasant’s scenario, and I’m sure there are millions of Russians, particularly young people, who would rather be on that train.” Tim Cadogan the CEO of GoFundMe said: “In the fortnight following the invasion a new gofundme page was launched every minute somewhere in the world. The help Ukraine fundraiser has gone on to become the largest UK gofundme page of all time.”",News/World news,Mikhail Baryshnikov: Do not punish Russian artists and athletes for war ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/mikhail-baryshnikov-do-not-punish-russian-artists-and-athletes-for-war-in-ukraine
3/20/2022,"It has become a common sight in the first three weeks of the invasion of Ukraine – Russian tanks, transporters and supply trucks burnt out at the side of the road, picked off by lightweight weaponry. While intrepid Ukrainian troops have been deploying the tactics, Britain has played a role in supplying the tech and the knowhow. While Britain’s response to the refugee crisis in Ukraine has been heavily criticised, it is now widely acknowledged in the world’s defence ministries to have played a leading role in arming Ukrainian troops with the most effective weapons, as well as training. “We can criticise British foreign policy at times, but we actually led,” said Professor Sir Lawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of war studies, King’s College London. “There has been very close cooperation with the Ukrainians for a while, so there was a good idea of what they’d need, but it also had a good anti-tank weapon to send them. It was the first to send substantial equipment before war began, and it has made a difference.” Those anti-tank weapon are the NLAWs, or next generation light anti-tank weapons, which have been so effective against Russian vehicles that have been left exposed as a result of a lack of military coordination. Britain’s involvement in training troops dates back to Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. In the face of some opposition within Whitehall, British military help for Ukraine was conducted through Operation Orbital from 2015. Ukraine’s former president Petro Poroshenko has said that he inherited a decrepit armed forces when he came to power in 2014, which was transformed by western aid. About 22,000 Ukrainian troops have been trained through the programme. Meanwhile, the NLAWs have been very effective, with some sources reporting an extraordinary 90% hit rate. The weapons, which can be swiftly deployed at close quarters and discarded, are lighter than the similar Javelin anti-tank missile systems, which the US has been dispatching to Ukraine. So far, Britain has sent more than 4,200 NLAWs. However, while the supply of the weapons and past training from Britain have helped, military experts warn that there simply has not been time to help Ukraine with the more sophisticated training and weapons systems required for countering a full invasion. It has left Britain and others largely restricted to supplying the lightweight defensive weaponry used so far. The government has said it will supply Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine, though even that system requires significant training time. “Operation Orbital has been very successful – but whether it proves successful enough is a different question,” said defence analyst Prof Michael Clarke. “The Russians first of all will bring in bigger numbers. Secondly, all military forces will learn to adapt, so Ukrainians will probably not be finding such easy targets.” Others warn that while Britain gave assistance to Ukraine in the years before the invasion, significant weaknesses remained in Ukrainian capabilities. Nick Reynolds, the research analyst for land warfare at Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), said that remedying those weaknesses or giving Ukrainian troops counter-offensive capabilities was now logistically very hard and risked leading to escalation. “There are limitations in terms of integrating kits, in whether Ukrainians can use it – and it is equipment we don’t want to fall into Russian hands,” he said. “At the same time, there’s just enormous difficulties in getting people trained up in terms of time. And when you’re trying to retain that line where Nato is not directly involved, would you train Ukrainian troops in a Nato country or send trainers into a war zone? If we wanted to help Ukraine in these ways, these are things that needed to happen beforehand, without the timeframe issues and complexities.”",News/World news,How British ‘tank-busters’ are helping Ukraine halt Russian attack ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/how-british-tank-busters-are-helping-ukraine-halt-russian-attack
3/20/2022,"Gail Bishop is locked out of her new home. The university professor, played by Regina Hall, has recently been appointed as house “master” at the elite (and fictional) Andover College. Except the keys she has been given don’t seem to work. It’s an elegant metaphor in Mariama Diallo’s smart debut feature about three black women - Gail, her colleague Liv Beckman (Amber Gray) and new student Jasmine (Zoe Renee) - as they each struggle to navigate the all-white institution. Two spectres haunt one of the college’s dorm rooms: a “witch” who was tried and hanged and Andover’s first black student, who died by suicide in 1968. There are parallels between Gail and Jasmine too, who are both rattled by a series of microaggressions at the hands of their white colleagues. Diallo utilises the visual language of horror – red lighting, empty shower stalls, a gnarled hand that emerges from under the bed – to express the terror of racism and the rot of its legacy.

3/20/2022,"Writer Ross Willis has a terrific feel for words, their sounds, their percussive qualities. In Wonder Boy, he fixes our focus on the power of language by presenting as the hero of his story 12-year-old Sonny (Raphel Famotibe), who stammers so much that he avoids talking. Instead, he draws, for his own eyes only, cartoon stories featuring Captain Chatter (Ramesh Meyyappan), whose amazing power is… speech. Following a classic triumph over adversity story arc (similar to that used in the film The King’s Speech), Sonny discovers he must face the challenge of delivering lines in public when the headteacher insists he perform in his school’s production of Hamlet. The staging shifts seamlessly between cartoon fantasy, reality and Sonny’s memories of his mother, thanks in part to Tom Newell’s videos and captions, incorporating the entire text into projections. The actors, under director Sally Cookson, deliver Willis’s text with energising relish. Raphel Famotibe is stupendous as Sonny, perfectly conveying the contrast between the boy’s sullen, withdrawn exterior and his vibrant inner life, as well as the frustration of not being able to say the words he thinks. It’s hard to believe this is his professional stage debut. As Sonny’s naughty schoolfriend Roshi, Juliet Agnes is a force of nature, winning a well-deserved round of applause for her delivery of the snappy, slangy, teen-view synopsis of Hamlet. Amanda Lawrence’s caustic but inspirational teacher, with a secret of her own, is lively and convincing, while Jenny Fitzpatrick is wicked as a tick-box-obsessed headteacher and touching as Mum. If the strength of Willis’s writing is the dialogue, the weakness lies in its construction. The development of the plot is schematic, rather than dramatic – structured as a sequence of scenes to tackle issues. Ultimately, it feels less like a main-house play and more like a beautifully produced example of effective theatre-in-education – inspiring, irrespective of age.
