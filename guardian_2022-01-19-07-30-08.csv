1/19/2022,"Ralf Rangnick has made stark admissions about two of Manchester United’s most expensive signings, saying Paul Pogba may be motivated to perform only because wants to leave and that Jadon Sancho is struggling to deal with the “psychological” pressure of playing for the club. Pogba’s £89.3m fee makes him United’s record transfer and Sancho’s £73m price ranks him as the third-highest. The former’s contract expires in summer and he is yet to agree a fresh deal.  Pogba is back in training after injury and is expected, by Rangnick, to be available early next month. The interim manager was asked whether there was any point selecting him given the 28-year-old could depart in the close season. “Yes, of course,” he said. “I also played Nemanja Matic in the last games and his contract is also expiring [in June 2023]. My contract as a manager is also expiring in the summer. For us we have the same goal. We have the same ambition to be as successful as we can possibly be in the next three or four months. “It’s not a question if a player has an expiring contract, the question is how much does he still want to be a part of this group, how much does he still feel emotionally and physically on board. “As long as this is the case, why shouldn’t Paul Pogba now, after two and half months of injury, fully fit again, and he wants to show the fans of Manchester United, the board, the whole world what kind of player he can be? Even if it’s only to show enough for a new contract elsewhere, he will be highly motivated to do that and why should I then not play him? “But there is a difference in how players deal with their current situation. If they handle that in a professional way, an ambitious way, I will play players although they have a contract expiring in the summer.” Sancho joined from Borussia Dortmund in July but has struggled, scoring twice in 23 appearances, including 14 starts, and making no assists. Rangnick was asked why Sancho’s form has been disappointing. “There is a difference if you come as an 18 year-old [he was 17 at the time], unknown, talented English boy to Borussia Dortmund,” he said. “From then you can only improve, make a success out of that. “The level of expectation was a lot lower compared to the situation where you come at the age of 23 [he is now 21] – you come to a club like Manchester United for a high transfer fee, with a high level of expectation. “Everyone expected from him that he would be one of the best players in the team. This is psychologically, emotionally, a more challenging situation than the one at Borussia Dortmund and these are exactly the kind of steps that he has to make to become a top player for the next 10 years at this club. “We can give guidelines, give him all the necessary assistance that he needs but in the end it’s up to him to take the next steps. It’s not only about training at the highest possible level. I said that to him the day before yesterday [Sunday] ‘Confirm the performances you show in training when you’re playing on the pitch.’ “It’s got to do with a lot of the things up here in his head. With those kinds of players, with creative offensive players it’s all about confidence, being aware of how good they can be then showing it in front of 75,000.” Rangnick is hopeful Cristiano Ronaldo and Marcus Rashford will be available after injury for Wednesday’s trip to Brentford.",Sport/Football,Ralf Rangnick happy to pick Paul Pogba despite lack of new deal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/18/ralf-rangnick-happy-to-pick-paul-pogba-jadon-sancho-manchester-united
1/19/2022,"Boris Johnson is expected to instruct millions to return to workplaces across England as he tries to placate furious MPs with a review of Covid restrictions that could end all rules introduced to combat Omicron. The cabinet will meet on Wednesday morning to examine Covid data and review plan B restrictions imposed in December amid the rapid spread of the variant, with Johnson set to update the Commons later in the day.  While an official statement said decisions remained “finely balanced”, ministers are widely expected to approve the end of current advice for people to work from home where possible and the use of vaccine certificates to enter venues like nightclubs and sports stadiums. This would happen from Monday 26 January, the pre-set review point for the plan B measures. It is also possible, if considered less likely, that the cabinet could drop the final plan B restriction which mandates masks on public transport and in shops. This move in particular would please many Conservative backbenchers, especially those in the influential Covid Recovery Group. In defending Johnson from calls to quit over claims he knowingly took part in lockdown-breaching parties, supporters have repeatedly talked up his decision to avoid stricter restrictions as Omicron spread, saying hospitalisation figures have since proved him right. But while total confirmed cases have started to drop slightly in recent days, albeit remaining near 100,000 a day nationally, the wave of infections has hit regions at different times, with the north of England nearer the peak than places such as London. The director of public health for one city in the north of England said they would be extremely wary at the idea of plan B restrictions being removed so soon. “It does feel too early, certainly in the north,” they said. “We’re still seeing real pressure in hospitals, and people being off work. The idea of dropping everything next week just doesn’t seem sensible. If we tell people they can all go back to the office, we’ll just get even more people off sick. “I personally thought we shouldn’t have lost masks when we did last year – it was too soon. Every time you take something away and try to reintroduce it, public support is lost. I just wish there was a bit more time, so we can feel slightly more comfortable. It’s not just Covid, but all the pressures on the NHS.” Another worry, they said, was the possibility of a wave of new infections affecting vulnerable people who had received a Covid booster some time ago, with the protection beginning to wane. While ministers have talked up the idea of an end of restrictions meaning Covid is moving from pandemic to endemic status, like seasonal flu, the public health director said this was premature. “We’re just not there yet,” they said. “You don’t see cases rising in the way we have in the last few weeks if something is endemic. It’s got to be a much more stable position.” More widely, ministers are looking at phasing out all remaining Covid rules in England, including the legal requirement to self-isolate after a positive Covid test, backed up by fines. This and other provisions, such as the requirement to give details to NHS Test and trace, are due to expire in March and could be allowed to lapse. A No 10 statement setting out the plan for Wednesday’s decision noted that case numbers are still high, with 17,000 Covid patients in hospital in England. A government spokesperson said: “Decisions on the next steps remain finely balanced. Plan B was implemented in December to slow the rapid spread of the extremely transmissible Omicron variant, and get more jabs in arms. “The Omicron variant continues to pose a significant threat and the pandemic is not over. Infections remain high but the latest data is encouraging, with cases beginning to fall.”",News/World news,Cabinet expected to approve relaxation of plan B Covid restrictions in England,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/cabinet-expected-to-approve-relaxation-of-plan-b-covid-restrictions-in-england
1/19/2022,"It will be of little consolation to Thomas Tuchel that he spotted the warning signs as soon as the game began and Brighton started getting on top of Chelsea. This was another disjointed effort from Chelsea and Tuchel, who cut an irritable figure throughout, cannot have been surprised when Adam Webster cancelled out Hakim Ziyech’s goal in the second half. Brighton had been the stronger side all evening and the European champions, who are winless in four league games, can surely forget about reeling in Manchester City. On this evidence, their main concern should be making sure they do not get dragged into a top-four battle.  It is difficult to kid Tuchel. Chelsea’s manager looked like he was waiting for something disastrous to happen during the first half and he barely offered any celebration when Ziyech gave his side an undeserved lead after 28 minutes. Tuchel had spent the majority of the early stages flinging his arms in the air in disgust and at times it seemed that he could not believe what he was watching, to the extent it was difficult to detect any improvement in his mood even after Ziyech’s drive from long range had squirmed beyond Robert Sánchez. Too passive when they lost to City, Chelsea had not convinced before going ahead. Their passing was sloppy and Brighton looked like the sharper side at first. Steven Alzate and Pascal Gross had set a brisk tempo in midfield for the hosts and Chelsea found it difficult to deal with Brighton’s frenetic pressing early on. The problem for Brighton, though, was a familiar one. They had chances, but they rarely tested Kepa Arrizabalaga. Jakub Moder skewed wide from the edge of the area after combining with Danny Welbeck, who would also bungle an opportunity, and it did not come as much of a surprise when their lack of bite ended up costing them. Chelsea, who ditched their back three for a 4-2-2-2 system, had started to exert a modicum of control before Ziyech’s goal. Mason Mount had hinted at an understanding with Callum Hudson-Odoi and there was a warning for Brighton when Romelu Lukaku briefly burst into life, loping down the right before presenting César Azpilicueta with a chance to test Sánchez. While there was not much else from Lukaku before the interval, Chelsea still had players who could conjure something out of nothing. Ziyech, surprisingly selected after disappointing against City, was a case in point. The winger spent the first 28 minutes giving the ball away, but he would let out his frustration in the best possible way, taking a pass from N’Golo Kanté before cutting in from the right and embarrassing Sánchez at the goalkeeper’s near post. Sitting on the bench by that stage, Tuchel still looked unimpressed. No doubt he had a few choice words to say when Hudson-Odoi, who partnered Lukaku, fired over when he had a chance to double Chelsea’s lead. Chelsea remained vulnerable. There was a frank exchange of views between Ziyech and Lukaku as they walked off at half-time and Brighton should have levelled at the start of the second half, only for Welbeck to miss from an angle. Welbeck’s pace was worrying Antonio Rüdiger and Thiago Silva, but the Brighton striker was not alone in causing havoc. Tariq Lamptey kept sprinting at Marcos Alonso, whose booking for fouling the right-back was utterly predictable, and Kanté and Jorginho had become increasingly swamped in the middle, the clever interchanges between Marc Cucurella and Alexis Mac Allister leaving Chelsea dazed and confused. With Lukaku unable to shake off Dan Burn at the other end, an equaliser felt inevitable. Mac Allister went close, Arrizabalaga pushing the Argentinian’s deflected shot away for a corner, but the pressure was growing. The cross came in from Mac Allister and Webster, completely unmarked, crashed a header into the Chelsea net. Level at last, Brighton threw on Neal Maupay and Leandro Trossard. Potter’s side poured forward, though they were lucky to escape when Rüdiger released Lukaku and Sánchez turned the striker’s shot wide. Tuchel responded, bringing Lukaku, Jorginho and Ziyech off for Timo Werner, Kai Havertz and Mateo Kovacic, but there was no late show from Chelsea. It would have been undeserved.",Sport/Football,Brighton dent Chelsea’s title hopes as Adam Webster header forces draw,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/18/brighton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report
1/19/2022,"There has been much talk in Downing Street circles this week of “Operation Red Meat”, which apparently involves lobbing juicy policy initiatives at Tory backbenchers to distract them from recent events. With Eddie Jones it is slightly different: “Operation Dead Meat” seems to be the subtext of most of his England squad announcements these days. The selection door, we are constantly informed, is never closed. Admittedly, Jamie George was recalled from squad oblivion in November and Jack Nowell has resurfaced after three years of injury-hit Six Nations exile. But try telling George Ford, Billy and Mako Vunipola – and even Elliot Daly – that a fulfilling England future still awaits them. Or advising Adam Radwan, Alex Mitchell and Louis Lynagh that their omission from the latest 36-man Six Nations training squad is a hidden blessing for their 2023 World Cup prospects. Jones’s blade, when it materialises, tends to be razor sharp.  Good luck, then, to the next consignment of newly arrived lambs because what percentage of Jones’s latest flock will survive the next cull? We are now nudging 180 players in various England squads since he took over and remembering who is on the old conveyor belt tonight – a la the Generation Game – grows ever harder. It also means few inside the team room can guarantee there will be no bullet with their name on next time. Is this ceaseless uncertainty healthy? From the perspective of Jones, the answer seems to be yes. Test rugby is all about leaving your comfort zone. England, by sheer dint of playing numbers, are relatively spoilt for choice. But as Jones endlessly tinkers, sifts and rotates, there is also a risk that his obvious obsession with winning the 2023 World Cup is clouding England’s prospects in the shorter term. Which, perversely, could dilute the momentum and confidence they need to reach their desired goal in 18 months’ time. The most glaring case study is Ford, once again omitted from the squad even with some uncertainty hanging over Owen Farrell’s match readiness. The former has been pulling the strings expertly for the country’s best club side – only for Jones to select Orlando Bailey from bottom-of-the-table Bath. Bailey, 20, is highly promising but is nowhere near as likely to win a major Test for England in 2022 as his in-form Leicester rival. The rationale, it seems, is that Bailey can play at 10, 12 or 15, making him a potentially valuable World Cup squad utility man. Fine, but what does that ultimately say about the approaching Six Nations campaign? That it is a development competition? That a grand slam or a title means little in the wider scheme of things? No one, if so, seems to have advised the rest of the field. It is a delicate balance, familiar to anyone employed in what might be termed a “results business.” In many ways Jones has a discerning eye: few would argue against the striking domestic efforts of Luke Northmore, Ollie Hassell-Collins, Ollie Chessum and, in particular, the force of nature that is Alfie Barbeary. But if Premiership form was a key prerequisite, this squad should also contain Ford, Danny Care and Dan Cole. Whether or not the latter trio make the World Cup, they would all enhance England’s prospects now. All of which makes this campaign a significant one in terms of public perception. Finish fifth again and, even with Manu Tuilagi seemingly unavailable again, there will be little sympathy. It would also leave Jones open to fresh accusations he is sacrificing today on the altar of tomorrow. “It’s a judgment call, there’s no science to tell you this is right, this is wrong,” he said. “To me, it is always about looking after now, but you’ve always got to have an eye to the future.” Fair enough but if the powerful Hassell-Collins is the missing link why did he not feature ahead of Radwan or Lynagh in the autumn? Or is it more about giving the latter pair a “work-harder” jolt? Maybe Nowell’s return has altered the picture – “He looks more like a rugby player and less like a bodybuilder,” said Jones – with the management seeking more solidity on at least one wing. Then there is the Farrell conundrum – by re-nailing him on as captain and implying he is untouchable when he has not played since November, how does that square with the lack of faith in others. If England were to end up sinking to defeat at Murrayfield on 5 Feb – Jones is already forecasting a wet weekend – with Farrell at 10 and Marcus Smith on the bench, it will be hard to argue the visible promise of autumn has been maintained. At least it appears that Alex Dombrandt stands an improving chance of starting at No 8. With Sam Underhill “not quite ready”, there is now scope to switch Tom Curry back to the openside with Courtney Lawes at No 6. While Harry Randall’s tactical kicking remains a distinctly mixed bag and 20 of the nominated 36 possess 10 caps or fewer, England undoubtedly have talent at their disposal. Should Jones’s ever-changing squad endure another mediocre Six Nations, however, Operation Dead Meat may need revisiting.",Sport/Sport,Operation Dead Meat: Ruthless Eddie Jones wields the knife again for England | Robert Kitson,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/18/operation-dead-meat-ruthless-eddie-jones-wields-the-knife-again-for-england
1/19/2022,"The McLaren chief executive, Zak Brown, has warned there is no guarantee Lewis Hamilton will continue to race in Formula One in the 2022 season. The seven-time champion’s future remains undecided after the driver was left angry and disillusioned with the sport having controversially lost the title to Max Verstappen in the 2021 season finale. Verstappen won his first F1 world championship at the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi, beating Hamilton to the win under highly contentious circumstances. Verstappen overtook Hamilton for victory on the final lap after the FIA race director, Michael Masi, applied and adapted rules regarding the safety car that many perceived as incorrect and led to Hamilton being powerless to defend against the Dutchman.  After a protest by Mercedes the FIA ruled Masi had acted within the rules but such was the disquiet across the paddock at what happened the FIA has instigated a full inquiry into the events. Hamilton said he believed the race had been “manipulated” to ensure he was beaten and is considering whether to retire from F1 as a result. Brown was convinced the British driver was serious. “I wouldn’t be shocked if he stopped, so no one should take for granted that he is coming back,” he said. “We should not discount or not recognise his frustration, his anger. Maybe he has not made a decision and what he is doing is taking time to make that decision to make sure. Because once it’s made, it’s made, I don’t think we should rule it out or make light of it.” Hamilton has not commented publicly since the race but Mercedes have indicated he will base any decision over his future on the conclusions and actions taken after the FIA inquiry. The FIA’s new president, Mohammed Ben Sulayem, has already met the Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, to discuss what happened in Abu Dhabi and will hold talks with the other team principals to avoid a repetition of the controversy. Brown emphasised the importance of the inquiry but said he believed it was an error of judgment rather than a calculated action against Hamilton. “They need to show they have taken action to make sure it doesn’t happen again but I don’t think this was a malicious decision,” he said. “For those who may have the view that the sport is corrupt, I don’t agree. Potentially a different decision could have been made but I want to wait to see what the FIA comes out with.” Masi’s future looks to be in doubt with many teams unhappy at the lack of consistency in decision-making during the season, leaving drivers unsure as to where they stood regarding wheel-to-wheel racing. With trust in the process undoubtedly further eroded by Masi’s role in Abu Dhabi the FIA may have little option but to replace him. They have stated their findings will not be released until 18 March, a bafflingly late stage, being the opening Friday of the first race of the season in Bahrain.",Sport/Sport,McLaren chief casts doubts on Lewis Hamilton’s future,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/18/mclaren-chief-casts-doubts-on-lewis-hamiltons-future
1/19/2022,"What a piece of work is man. And, just occasionally – relatively speaking – woman, too. In Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile (ITV), reporter and presenter Ranvir Singh traces the grisly story of Ghislaine Maxwell and her conviction on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy for her part in procuring underage girls – a child of just 14 in one of the cases brought to trial – for the convicted paedophile and billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. At 45 minutes (plus adverts) it is not an in-depth investigation to match either the four-hour Netflix miniseries Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich nor the three-part documentary by Sky, Epstein’s Shadow (the latter skewing close to the view of Maxwell as victim, but nevertheless covering a lot of ground in detail).  The question it poses at the start rather answers itself. “How did the privileged daughter of a billionaire newspaper tycoon, intimate with high society and royal palaces, become a paedophile’s accomplice?” Could it be that when you grow up in a tiny bubble of rich, protected, privileged, narcissist- and sociopath-heavy elitists, certain human traits such as empathy, conscience and morality are not as fully nurtured as they might be? Discuss over champagne and little people’s tears. The show is structured around the unfolding of the 12-day trial, interspersed with new and older interviews with survivors of Epstein and Maxwell’s predations (one of whom, Annie Farmer, recalls how, at 16, she brought a homework assignment on British writers to an early visit, eager for Maxwell’s input), and an attempt to establish the nature of Maxwell’s relationship with (no longer His Royal Highness) Prince Andrew. They first met when she was at Oxford University and moving in circles that included prime-minister-to-be Boris Johnson. During the years she was with Epstein, she had – according to Andrew’s former protection officer Paul Page – such free access to the palace that his team assumed she and the prince were having “an intimate relationship”. Page also reveals that the prince keeps “50 or 60 soft toys” on his bed and a laminated photo of them at his bedside. If the maids don’t put them back in exactly the order shown, he shouts, screams and becomes “verbally abusive”. You could argue that this is not relevant to the claims mounting against him as a result of his friendship with Epstein, of course. That’s the friendship (as we are shown again in a clip of the infamous interview with Emily Maitlis, which becomes no less excruciating with the passage of time) Andrew claimed endured after Epstein’s conviction for child abuse because of “my tendency to be too honourable”. On the other hand, what could be more relevant than such glaring proof of how deep the childishness and sense of entitlement runs in the man? The survivors and their lawyer, Lisa Bloom, describe how powerful a weapon Maxwell was. As a female member of Epstein’s entourage, she made the girls she met relax and become more vulnerable to her recruitment tactics. Lisa Phillips, who was 21 when she first met Epstein, remembers Maxwell brightly announcing that: “‘Jeffrey is waiting for his massage!’ She made it seem normal.” Once in his room, “things took a turn and it wasn’t normal any more”. Singh tells her it’s understandable if she froze. “No,” says Phillips. “I went along with it. That’s what happens in these situations. You’re not going to kick and scream and yell.” There’s a study to be done on the evolution of women’s testimony over the past few years. If you have watched enough of what we might loosely call the #MeToo documentaries – Surviving R Kelly, for example, or Untouchable: the Rise and Fall of Harvey Weinstein, Look Away and many others – you can see it has become gradually bolder, and Phillips feeling able to stand by having had what was once accepted as an “unnatural” reaction to her assault is a heartening instance of it. In Look Away, about sexual abuse and exploitation in the music industry, Jackie Fuchs gave a short account of being drugged and raped by her band’s manager and then, in what felt like a watershed moment, wrested back narrative control by adding: “And now we stop talking about this. Because I think there are people out there who just feed off watching women cry, talking about their sexual assault. And I just want to say – if you’re one of them: fuck you. Your time is over.” Maxwell faces up to 65 years in prison. Her brother Ian gives a tearful interview to Singh towards the end of the programme. “We believe her. We love her. And we hope she will get the justice she definitely deserves.” At least part of that sentiment we can all agree with wholeheartedly.",Arts/Television & radio,"Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile review – a grisly story of sexual abuse and royal palaces",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/18/ghislaine-prince-andrew-and-the-paedophile-review-a-grisly-story-of-sexual-abuse-and-royal-palaces
