4/23/2022,"The biggest compliment you can currently pay Leicester is that they are playing like an international team. Steve Borthwick has worked for long enough at the right hand of Eddie Jones in Japan and England to know the importance of being tough to play against as well as supremely fit. He has also gathered some shrewd tactical lieutenants around him and the uplift in Tigers’ efficiency has been conspicuous. Even their rivals acknowledge there has been no disputing the best side in the country from September to April. “What they’ve done is go back to their roots,” says the Harlequins’ coach, Tabai Matson. “They are formidable around the set piece – the best in the league – are ferocious defensively and work so hard for each other. “Underpinning their success is the fact they’re leading the competition in those areas. George Ford is leading them well, the captain [Ellis Genge] is in the engine room and he’s playing well. A lot of things are back that have been their trademarks for decades. They’re clearly well-drilled with Borthers there and they’re setting the standard.” The only question marks are the normal ones associated with longtime frontrunners: can they find another gear in the closing stages? TSaturday’s trip to Harlequins will be instructive: if the champions can be ground down on their own patch Tigers fans will see no reason why they cannot return to Twickenham’s biggest stage and beat anyone in June. Falter at home to Leinster in the European quarters, though, and a little self-doubt could resurface. Leicester (1st, 80 points) Remaining fixtures: Saturday Harlequins (A), 30 April Bristol (H), 21 May Newcastle (A), 4 June Wasps (H) Saracens (2nd, 72pts) Remaining fixtures: Sunday Exeter (H), 30 April Worcester (A), 21 May Northampton (H), 4 June Gloucester (A) Harlequins (3rd, 68pts) Remaining fixtures: Saturday Leicester (H), 29 April Northampton (A), 21 May Gloucester (H), 4 June Exeter (A) Exeter (4th, 62pts) Remaining fixtures: Sunday Saracens (A), 20 May Bristol (A), 4 June Harlequins (H) Gloucester (5th, 60pts) Remaining fixtures: Friday Bristol (A), 30 April Bath (H), 21 May Harlequins (A), 4 June Saracens (H) Northampton (6th, 58pts) Remaining fixtures: Saturday Bath (A), 29 April Harlequins (H), 21 May Saracens (A), 4 June Newcastle (H) It has been a long road back to the playoffs for Saracens, last involved in a Premiership final three years ago. There have been flashes of their old dominant selves but, by their own admission, they have not been firing consistently. Less experience in certain positions? Overeagerness? According to Ben Earl, the league’s top tackler, a much more upbeat narrative may yet unfold. “If you look at Quins’ template last year momentum was crucial for them. That’s something we’ve been speaking about … not so much the tangible five points every week but the feeling we’re getting on the pitch. We’ve had a couple of crucial people injured but we’re slowly getting back to a full complement and we’re excited about what that could mean.” Having lost at Sandy Park this season, though, there is recognition that Sunday will be tough. “Exeter is a massive rivalry. There’s obviously been a bit of bite between the two teams over the years … we know that if we’re slightly off it we’re going to get punished.” Ealing Trailfinders have withdrawn the club's appeal against the decision denying them promotion to the Premiership. Earlier this month, the RFU announced that both Ealing, who went on to win the Championship title, and Doncaster Knights had failed to meet the criteria for Premiership entry, with their home grounds unable to hold more than 10,000 fans. Ealing's Trailfinders Sports Ground is able to hold approximately 5,000 spectators, with 2,115 seats. ""We are disappointed that having won the Championship, we will not be taking our rightful place in the Gallagher Premiership,"" a club statement said. ""We remain humbled and grateful for the enormous support we have received from the wider public during this frustrating process. ""Rest assured that Ealing Trailfinders remain more committed and passionate than ever in becoming a successful Premiership club and strongly believe in the circumstances we are dealt, this is our best route forward in achieving that at the earliest possible date."" The chance to knock the Chiefs out of the title running would be a further bonus. “It’s an elephant in the room in terms of what they need out of the game but we also know we have Quins breathing down our necks,” says Earl. “If we take our foot off the pedal we’re probably going to pay the price for it. It’s as big a game for us as it is for them in terms of belief.” At their best no one has a sharper attacking edge than Quins. They are the Premiership’s top try-scorers with 78 but they give the opposition a chance, too. Saracens, their likely playoff opponents, have completed a home and away double against their London adversaries this season and Leicester have also beaten them. The good news from Matson’s perspective is that the club’s narrow two-leg European exit to Montpellier has hardened his players’ resolve. “If we don’t get this right Leicester will humiliate us,” warned the coach. “You can’t sulk for too long. This week’s really important for measuring ourselves. The two teams in front of us in the league are setting the standard. They’ve set the benchmark and we need to lift.” Quins are not about to retreat into their shells but against Montpellier their decision-making was not as consistently sure-footed as it might have been. “The lessons we learned from that defeat we have to right if we are to be serious contenders,” continued Matson. “The way we play it’s always going to be a balancing act. We want to play to our DNA but you have to be very pragmatic against the best teams in Europe.” As they showed against Bristol and Exeter last season, though, a dramatic late comeback can never be discounted and, as Matson stresses, it is what happens next that really matters: “We have still got another nine weeks of the competition left and they are the most important nine weeks.” Exeter’s normally assured place in the playoffs is currently far from guaranteed. Gloucester’s five-point haul after their cancelled fixture with Worcester had propelled them into fifth before their visit to Bristol on Friday night, a match they ultimately lost 29-28. Northampton are also in the frame. Much will hinge on Gloucester’s final two regular season games against Harlequins (away) and Saracens (home); both opponents are likely to be pushing for a home semi-final and at least one of them will have to be beaten. The Cherry & Whites have been building nicely under George Skivington but this season they have lost home and away to Exeter and the European Challenge Cup remains another distraction. The Saints, meanwhile, have Dan Biggar and Courtney Lawes sidelined and may have left themselves with too much to do. Which brings us back to the Chiefs, Premiership finalists for the past six seasons and twice winners. Injuries have weakened them at key moments, untimely red cards at Harlequins and Worcester also proved costly, and losses at home to Northampton, Newcastle and Wasps by a combined aggregate of four points have not helped either. All that said, their destiny remains largely in their own hands and they should still make the playoffs if they can win at Saracens on Sunday. “We cannot talk about what happened earlier in the season and be hard on ourselves, we just have to win every game,” stressed their experienced Irish centre Ian Whitten. “We have to beat Sarries, we cannot afford to drop any more points.” ",Sport/Sport,Who holds the aces as the race for the Premiership title hots up? | Robert Kitson,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/22/race-for-the-premiership-title-hots-up-rugby-union
4/23/2022,"Last November more than 2,000 people arrived on Temae beach, the heart of Mo’orea island in French Polynesia. The gathering was a a traditional cultural ceremony called a tahei, which saw people tie braided ti leaf cords together in a symbol of peace. The purpose was to raise awareness of the growing number of developments by a number of different groups on the island, which includes plans for two new hotels, plus more than 300 villas, homes and bungalows, catering to high-end visitors. Temae is one of just three beaches accessible to the public on the entire island, the rest are privately owned or attached to resorts and inaccessible to locals. But some locals fear Temae may soon to be lost to the public too. Last year, 53 acres of land at Temae, including the waterfront, was purchased for an estimated 4bn Pacific Francs, ($36m). The land was bought by Wane group, a major player in the French Polynesian economy, running hotels and owning the country’s largest supermarket chains. They also own the Sofitel Resort, near Temae. No announcement has been made about plans for the land But some fear that the recently purchased beachfront may be used to expand the activities of the resort. Wane group did not respond to requests for comment. In a television interview, a spokesperson for Wane group reassured the population that Wane group was working for economic development in harmony with the community and the natural environment. “Part of the beach will probably remain open to the public,” she said in the interview, adding: “Mo’orea has a unique environment, and this environment will be respected.” The Keep Moorea Wild movement, which organised the tahei, and the Temae Residents association would like to see the land at Temae used in a way that benefits locals, such as building a public park in the area. However, Hironui Johnston, a government official at the Ministry of Tourism and Labour, pointed out that the land at Temae was privately owned before Wane group’s acquisition, and the previous owners allowed the locals access. He said that the government couldn’t afford to buy the land at Temae, nor can they now build a public park on privately owned land. Many locals are concerned that the number of new developments by different groups across the island privatise huge areas of land, could negatively impact the environment and contribute to real estate speculation. Others argue that the developments bring much-needed jobs and boost economic growth. “Growing up in Mo’orea, as a kid I used to think wow, this place is beautiful, it’s magic. But all of these places where I used to go play were getting destroyed to build parking lots and big homes,” said Temoana Poole, a photographer and one of the founders of Keep Mo’orea Wild. He started the campaign group in response to extensive high-end development. Their goal is to preserve Mo’orea’s natural environment for future generations, as well as to promote sustainable, indigenous-centred development. The movement already pitched one project to the local government for funding - a centre focused on connecting local people with tourists through culture and nature-based sports - however they claim they never received a response from government officials. “Polynesia is so special and if it just becomes another concrete jungle, another city then it will lose its mana (power/spirit), it’ll lose what makes it special - the culture, the people, everything,” says Poole. The influx of property developers in Mo’orea has also contributed to rising housing prices and real estate speculation has become a mounting issue. One hectare of land at Temae now sells for upwards of $250,000, a price that most locals cannot afford. The land is, however, being snapped up by foreign investors who buy land to build holiday houses, then market them as Airbnbs. Others are creating subdivisions, homes and villas for high-end visitors. “Every family living here wants to be able to afford to live on the island. This is where we were born and raised. Where are we supposed to move if we can’t live here?” said Mo’orea resident and tour operator Heimata Hall. “This is about preserving who we are, preserving our culture, preserving our people.” However, supporters of high-end developments argue that they boost the economy, attract more tourists and provide locals with employment. Tourism is French Polynesia’s number one export and represents 12% of GDP. Mo’orea is the second most visited island in French Polynesia, but it lags behind both Bora Bora and Tahiti in terms of tourist accommodations. According to the Ministry of Tourism and Labour, Mo’orea’s hotel accommodation capacity sits at just over 1,000 beds, compared to Tahiti and Bora Bora which can both accommodate close to double that figure. A new hotel would make it possible for more tourists to visit the island and provide up to 800 new jobs, says Hironui Johnston, a government official at the Ministry of Tourism and Labour, an important contribution considering the unemployment rate in French Polynesia is 12.8%, according to the French Polynesian Institute of Statistics. But activists say these jobs aren’t always lucrative. “This is like an old mindset that we need development, we need a hotel, and that doesn’t work anymore,” said Poole. “What do the locals get? Well they get to be maids, they get to be bartenders, you know, they get to clean the garden, and they get to just survive in a minimum wage job.” He said many of these kinds of jobs are “jobs to survive in society not to thrive.” Johnston acknowledges that the developments can have an impact on the environment but says that it is in the interests of developers to preserve natural beauty. “Even if we think economically or in terms of finances, it is in the interest of [developers] to preserve the environment because that is the selling point for Tahiti.” In September 2021, a clause in the law involving Mo’orea’s maritime space management plan was changed potentially allowing overwater bungalows on the lagoon at Temae, an area that was previously under environmental protection. Ronald Teariki, the mayor of Teavaro, the district where Temae is located, said that over 200 meetings were held across the island with residents regarding changes to the laws, but that the change that would allow overwater bungalows was made at the last minute at the federal level. He has since participated in meetings to address local concerns. “The district has asked the [federal government] for permission to create a control committee. A strategic control committee in relation to these developments’ zones.” The committee would help keep residents informed and ensure that any developments are in line with environmental laws to protect marine ecosystem at Temae. Teariki believes that a committee like this would help residents feel their concerns are taken seriously and would encourage developers to create environmentally-friendly developments. “These promoters can’t do whatever they want, They must follow Mo’orea’s Maritime space management laws,” he said.",News/World news,Private paradise: The French Polynesian island locking locals out of beaches,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/22/private-paradise-the-french-polynesian-island-locking-locals-out-of-beaches
4/23/2022,"When the US federal government’s mandate requiring masks on transportation was lifted this week, reports of celebration ensued. Videos were shared of people removing their masks and cheering, music was blasted over plane speakers, pilots shared the news from the cockpit and flight attendants jumped with joy. When Maureen Miller, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, heard the news, she had a very different reaction. She was “horrified”. “We’re basically ensuring that infectious and susceptible people are together for a chunk of time, with no protection at all,” she said. Public health experts like Miller have widely criticized the removal of the federal travel mask mandate, a contrast to the jubilant stance airlines and some passengers have taken to the news. The dissonance in reactions adds to the confusion over how to behave as the pandemic continues. People are now left to weigh how much risk they want to take – and how much of a risk they want to be to other people – when they travel on planes, buses and trains. The thought is troubling to some who have been studying the pandemic. “I don’t think individual responsibility can solve the epidemic,” said Abraar Karan, an infectious disease physician and researcher at Stanford University. Karan noted that wastewater surveillance testing – which is increasingly being used as official reporting of cases becomes less reliable – has indicated a rise in cases as the BA.2 Omicron subvariant continues to spread. “This is not the time to be pulling back on mitigation measures in shared public indoor spaces,” Karan said. “The problem is that everyone’s coming together, and they’re dispersing to different places. You’re potentially seeding outbreaks to different areas.” The potential for outbreaks is what drove the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to delay on 13 April the end of the transportation mask mandate by two weeks, from 18 April to 3 May. The agency said it wanted to assess the rise in cases that have been attributed to the spread of the BA.2 Omicron subvariant before it lifted the mandate. “Since early April, there have been increases in the 7-day moving average of cases in the US,” the CDC said in a statement at the time. “In order to assess the potential impact the rise of cases has on severe disease, including hospitalizations and deaths, and health care system capacity, the CDC order will remain in place at this time.” But then a US district court judge in Florida on 18 April struck down the extension, saying that the agency overstepped its authority. Cue the videos of mask-less people cheering on planes. On Wednesday, the justice department said it was filing an appeal seeking to overturn the judge’s ruling, leaving it unclear whether the mandate will be lifted permanently. In a statement, the CDC said it is still studying the potential of another wave and still recommends that people wear masks “in all indoor public transportation settings”. Miller said she was concerned about what message the lifting of the mandate is giving to Americans. “The federal travel mandate removal is the final push over the edge that tells the population you don’t have to worry about this any more, it’s under control,” she said. The travel industry had been particularly eager for the mandate to end, with airlines lobbying to have the mandate lifted over the last few weeks. Earlier this month, the trade group Airlines for America sent a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services saying the “public health environment” had changed and that “science and research … clearly support lifting the mask mandate”. All major airlines quickly dropped their mask policies once the mandate was lifted. Delta Air Lines went so far as to release a statement that said the company was “relieved” about the mandate’s end “as Covid-19 has transitioned to an ordinary seasonal virus”. After backlash on that phrasing, the airlines updated the statement, calling Covid “a more manageable respiratory virus”. For many employees of airlines, the problem with face masks did not come from following the mandate itself, but dealing with angry customers who refused to wear masks. A survey from the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA) found a rise in the number of flight attendants who had to deal with unruly passengers. One in five had experienced physical incidents, while 85% had to deal with unruly passengers in 2021. The Federal Aviation Administration reported that investigations into unruly passengers spiked during the pandemic, largely because of issues with mask compliance. “They don’t like being policemen on airplanes,” David Neeleman, founder of JetBlue and CEO of Breeze Airways, told the New York Times. In a statement released after the mask mandate was lifted, Sara Nelson, president of the AFA noted the trouble flight attendants had with enforcing mandates. “During this pandemic, flight attendants have dealt with constant disruptions in our workplaces, including harassment and violence at a level never seen before,” she said. “We urge the government, all airlines and airports to work urgently on consistent, clear messaging on the new policy, the recommendations to keep everyone safe and the expectation of mutual respect and calm in our airports and planes.” To the dismay of union leaders, including Nelson, some airlines – American, United and Delta – said they will allow passengers who were banned from flying for refusing to wear masks to fly with them again. “We have talked to them individually,” Scott Kirby, United CEO, told NBC. “Many of them assure that now that the mask mandate is off, everything is going to be fine, and I trust that the vast majority of them will [be].” While airlines are happily getting their passengers back onboard, what the lifting of the mandate will mean for the pandemic is unclear. Some public health experts have expressed concern over the uncertainty of the effects of long Covid, even in those who initially had mild cases of the virus. Karan recalls getting Covid in January and being out sick for 10 days. He had ongoing symptoms for weeks. “I don’t want to get infected again. I just don’t want to continue to be reinfected with every wave, and I’ve been advising people not to take that lightly,” he said. “[The judge’s decision] is really obstructive to the public health effort right now. We may see consequences of that. We may have more population immunity from day one than we suspected, we have vaccinations, but we just don’t know. It’s a lot of uncertainty right now.”",News/Business,Lifting of Covid mask mandate on US transportation horrifies health experts,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/22/covid-mask-mandate-us-transportation-experts
4/23/2022,"Liberal MPs in at-risk “teal” seats are being left with little financial support from the Coalition in the lead-up to the election, at the same time as they are being outspent on advertising by their independent challengers. Analysis by Guardian Australia of the key seats being contested between Liberal MPs and Climate 200-backed independents shows that the Coalition has committed a total of just $92m out of a total of almost $6bn in discretionary spending made since the beginning of the year. This covers the seats of Wentworth, Mackellar, North Sydney, Kooyong, Goldstein, Warringah and Curtin. On advertising, analysis of Facebook and Google political ad transparency data shows independent candidates, backed by Climate 200 and donations from individuals, are outspending their opponents by tens of thousands of dollars on digital ads in Kooyong, North Sydney, Mackellar, Wentworth and Goldstein. This also includes ads for candidates run by the Climate 200 Facebook page, as well as Liberal party Facebook pages. This analysis only covers digital advertising on Facebook, Google’s ad network and YouTube and does not include advertising from other sources, such as print, TV or outdoors. The Liberal MP Jason Falinski, who is being challenged in his northern beaches seat of Mackellar by Climate 200-backed Sophie Scamps, said the amount being spent by independents was “immoral”. It is expected that Scamps will spend more than $1m trying to win the seat, with a combination of traditional and digital advertising. Falinski suggested that the independents could instead be directing their financial resources to charity, giving the example of much-needed emergency accommodation for women fleeing domestic violence as one worthy cause. “I just think it is an immoral use of money; we have real problems in the world and for these guys to be spending $2m against members of parliament, when, according to them, they agree with their member profiles, is just immoral. “They agree with us on climate, they agree with us on equity for women, and they agree with us on integrity, but instead of helping us they are trying to knock us off.” Scamps suggested Falinski was “plucking figures from out of the sky or from the depths of social media rumour mills”. “Our campaign began two years ago with conversations at kitchen tables across the electorate to listen to the concerns of people who had been taken for granted for too long,” she said. “We are immensely proud and humbled by the way it has grown into a campaign supported by over 900 eager volunteers including some who have left their jobs to volunteer full-time on the campaign, as well as 640 donors who have collectively donated $565,644 to date. “Additionally, Climate 200 is matching those community donations to help level the playing field against the resources and advantages held by the major parties.” The single largest government commitment made to the teal seats since the beginning of the year is $75m for the Wakehurst Parkway in Mackellar. The seat of Wentworth has been promised $500,000 for upgrades to Redleaf Beach to make it more accessible, while North Sydney has been pledged just $85,000 in discretionary grants for the Hayden Orpheum Picture Palace. According to digital advertising data compiled by Guardian Australia, Falinski has spent about $13,000 on Facebook and Google advertising, compared with about $100,000 spent by Scamps and Climate 200. The government is instead focusing most of its resources to traditional marginal seat contests in the outer suburbs and regions, with Guardian Australia’s Pork-o-meter showing hundreds of millions flowing into the battleground seats of Gilmore, Bass, Leichhardt, Lingiari, Hunter and Lindsay. In Wentworth, independent Allegra Spender and Climate 200 have spent almost $140,000 on Facebook and Google ads, more than twice the amount spent by incumbent MP Dave Sharma. Since the beginning of the year, the Coalition has promised two new projects in the south-east Melbourne seat of Goldstein in Victoria, with a $5m funding boost for a new “natural oasis” in Bayside, and $8.5m towards a commuter car park upgrade at Hampton. Independent for Goldstein Zoe Daniel and Climate 200 have spent almost $40,000 on digital advertising compared with only $2,000 to Wilson and the Victorian Liberal party. In Kooyong, where the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, is fending off a challenge from Dr Monique Ryan, the independent has spent more than $170,000 on digital advertising, closely followed by Frydenberg, whose spend tallies about $140,000. This includes at least $25,000 in ads on the Victorian Liberal’s Facebook page which target Ryan specifically or target voters in Kooyong with ads suggesting voting for an independent will result in “uncertainty”. The anti-independents campaign is running in other areas as well, and directs people to a Liberal party campaign website suggesting the independents are “fake” and are tied to other political parties and groups. Ryan has secured more than $1m in funding from 1,800 donors including Climate 200, with estimates that the candidates are on track to spend more than $2m. The only Coalition-funded local project in the seat announced so far is $2m for the Yarra Boulevard upgrade. Guardian Australia is tracking election spending announcements throughout the election campaign, and the latest update to the Pork-o-meter shows both the major parties have promised $506m in local, discretionary spending in the first week of the campaign, with millions more for national and state-wide projects.

4/23/2022,"In one neighbourhood, the first metric was the letterbox: a thickening sheath of “For Sale” advertisements clogging up the mail. “Almost daily junk mail advertising houses for sale,” said Greg, who lives in the central North Island city of New Plymouth. Then he noticed things changing on the street. “Every house on our road that has sold since we moved in three years ago has sold within a week,” he said. “But now the house down the road has been on the market for about a month with no signs of moving.” The same trickle of symptoms are becoming visible in many cities across New Zealand: for-sale signs staying up as the lawns grow around them, auctions passing by with no bids, listing pages mounting up on real estate websites. For years, the country’s housing market has been on a seemingly-unstoppable upward trajectory, with homes in major centres averaging at over $1m a pop. Now, New Zealand is in the midst of some of the largest drops and slowdowns since the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Some banks are predicting a 10% fall over the course of 2022. The Guardian asked readers to share how they were experiencing drops in the market, and found a mixture of trepidation, relief and hope. As economists warn of “monster” inflation that could push mortgage payments up, some of New Zealand’s locked-out homebuyers are hoping they might be able to pick up the pieces. “I’m partly excited about this, any change from the sky-high property market of the last two years is a potential ‘in’ for me as a first homebuyer,” said Megan, 35, a design director from Wellington. “However I’m also terrified of the looming recession and what that means if I were to be dealing with a mortgage for the first time as well as new costs like insurance and rates.” For some, it’s the first glimpse of a chance at owning a property. “My partner and I believe the drop in prices mean we might be able to purchase a house this year,” said Shayna,* an IT worker in Wellington. “We’re going to wait a few more months to see if it drops slightly more. We’re lucky to be in the fortunate position of having an above average, double income and potential help from parents – I think we would really struggle if it weren’t for these factors, but we’ll see what happens.” “Frankly, it’s a relief,” said Will, a public servant in his late 20s, “I do worry for friends who have really stretched themselves to buy a house who will now face massively increased payments.” Those concerns are widespread: a perfect storm of rising interest rates, tighter lending laws, inflation, high cost of living and dropping prices. Consumer NZ surveying released last week found just 16% of New Zealanders thought it was a “good time to buy” in February 2022, down from 25% in October 2021. Conversely, 58% thought it was a bad time to buy, up 8 percentage points. New Zealanders were increasingly concerned that a house might not hold its value – an increasing portion believed homes would drop in value over the next year, and fewer thought it would increase. 83% overall thought the housing market was still either “overinflated” or “out of control”. That means many new buyers are concerned about stretching beyond their means – and some who bought when the market was at its peak may find themselves in trouble. “I’m torn between trying to bag a good house for a good price and lock in a reasonable interest rate for a couple of years to try and ride it out, or just sitting tight for the next 6-9 months to see which direction it goes,” Megan said. “Wasting $27,500 a year on rent is incredibly painful, but at least I’m currently only dealing with the rising cost of living – if I get a mortgage I’ve got to add the pain of high interest rates on top of that.” New Zealand’s runaway housing market has long been seen as one of the country’s most pressing social problems, creating and entrenching both class and generational wealth inequalities. So for some who already own homes, the change is bittersweet: happiness that their peers or the next generation might be able to get on the ladder, combined with the anxiety of watching their own houses lose value. “I’m relieved it’s slowing,” said Tracy, 36, of Hawkes Bay, “Our property must be worth over a million by now, but I would be delighted to see values halve – even drop to a quarter of their peak.” Her sentiment was echoed by Jess, 44, an educational consultant from Waikanae. “My partner and I own our home in a small town and its value has gone from $340,000 to $1.03m in eight years. It’s ridiculous. We have no idea how any average people can get their first home or how impossible it must feel for low income earners. We will be happy to see our value come down – it means a more equitable New Zealand may be possible.” “I’m pleased this has happened,” said David, 52, a business owner in Auckland who was in the process of selling his own home. “We were way out of kilter and hopefully this will help young homebuyers. [I’m] sad for those that purchased just last year and hope that not too many are affected badly.” *Shayna’s name has been changed to anonymise them.",News/World news,"New Zealand’s cooling housing market means opportunity for some, angst for others",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/23/housing-dilemma-cooling-new-zealand-market-means-opportunity-for-some-angst-for-others
4/23/2022,"When Kim Ravaillion took a break from international netball in September 2018 she had no idea of the rollercoaster she would be on over the next four years. In 2019 she learnt she was pregnant with her first child and a return to the Diamonds was the last thing on her mind. But after making a stunning comeback to Suncorp Super Netball with the Queensland Firebirds in 2021 and consolidating that form over the initial rounds of the 2022 season, many were sure she would be in the mix for the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham this year. Instead Ravaillion was a conspicuous absence from the 18-player squad named this week, highlighting the difficulties that female athletes face in returning to sport after pregnancy. Former Diamonds’ captain Caitlin Bassett brought the issue into the spotlight in a News Corp column this week, when she spoke of the way players in the past were urged to be “smart” with contraception and not risk losing their place on the team. It is a difficult line to tread. In most careers, parental leave provisions guarantee that someone returning to work after the birth of a child is entitled to come back into the same role that they held previously. But for female athletes there is more at play. Pregnancy takes a heavy toll on the body and there are often traumatic effects of childbirth that simply cannot be planned for. The pressure to return to their previous standard of play is immense and to make things even more difficult, they have a whole group of often younger, fitter players breathing down their neck and vying for their position. While there are exceptions to the rule – Ravaillion’s teammate Gretel Bueta has returned to the court and retained her Diamonds spot without a hitch after the birth of her son – for most female athletes it is a hard road to tread. Even once pregnancy and birth complications are taken out of the equation, societal expectations around the gendered division of labour come into play. Mothers are expected to take a more active role in raising children than fathers, meaning that male athletes can hop on a plane and wave goodbye to their partners and children for a few months while they pursue their sporting dreams, but this is a much harder ask for female athletes. Provisions are now in place for netballers to bring a carer along while they travel to look after their children, but the pressure of having children close by and the guilt of not being the one to attend to them at all times is considerable. Of course this is assuming that athletes are able to make their return at all. During the Covid-stricken 2020 Super Netball season, the entire competition took place in a Queensland hub. While the Collingwood Magpies struggled on the court, their star goal attack Nat Medhurst spent months in Melbourne, desperately trying to make a return to the court. She was able to get an exemption for herself and her newborn son to travel to Queensland, but there were difficulties in securing one for her partner. This effectively left Medhurst stranded. Although the pandemic threw a significant spanner in the works in that situation, these are considerations that complicate sport for women. In the end, Medhurst announced her retirement from netball without returning to the court. There are so many factors to consider and while no one can claim to have all the answers, it is a discussion worth returning to as these issues continue to arise. In the years gone past, women waited until they retired to start a family – as Bassett alluded to in her column. However, greater availability of information around fertility has led many female athletes to decide that waiting isn’t an option they are willing to take. Netballers such as Medhurst, Liz Ellis and England stars Geva Mentor and Chelsea Pitman have spoken openly about fertility problems and egg freezing, but as yet there is no perfect solution. Athletes with female partners who are prepared to carry the children, such as Ash Brazill and cricket’s Megan Schutt and Rachael Haynes, are better able to balance motherhood and professional sport, but clearly that is not a solution open to every female athlete. As professionalism of women’s sport continues to grow, this will be a question that keeps arising. Responding to the changing needs of athletes will take flexibility, understanding and the ability to listen to the needs of each individual. It won’t be an easy solution, but it will be worth the work to see some of our most exciting athletes thriving at the top again after having children.",Sport/Sport,Female athletes still have to tread a hard road back to action post-pregnancy | Megan Maurice,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/23/female-athletes-still-have-to-tread-a-hard-road-back-to-action-post-pregnancy
4/23/2022,"Almost two decades ago, Lyndall Parris had her big idea. “Two of my friends’ husbands died, leaving them to continue bringing up their two teenagers alone. I just started thinking: this is crazy. I can’t help them much, they’re living in different places. If we were living together in a village, wouldn’t it be easier?” she recalls. Parris began researching alternative ways of living. She did a Tafe course to “to find out what the hell a website was”, built a page and began connecting with like-minded souls online. In 2012, 24 of them pooled their money to buy a 68-hectare plot of land outside Gosford on the New South Wales Central Coast. In 2019, the first residents moved in. They called it Narara Ecovillage. Today, Narara is home to 250 people who share lives and front yards. Residents come together for potluck dinners and movie nights, run their own school holiday program, hold community meetings and resolve disputes using a method called “sociocracy”, where agreement on matters is reached via listening circles. Adults commit at least 52 hours a year to working bee tasks that contribute to the upkeep of their property or the bonds of their community, be that dusting cobwebs off their town hall or leading tai chi classes in the morning. It’s a place where going to get a morning coffee can take an hour if you run into anyone along the way. Because as Parris describes it, “Nobody comes here if they don’t want to say hello to their neighbours.” But their community is, Parris says, pretty normal. “There are some people who come here looking for a sect and go, oh, these people are too sane for us,” she says. Narara Ecovillage is one of the many communities around the world that engage in what’s known as collaborative living, where multiple people live together in a shared space. Collaborative living can encompass eco-villages such as Narara, in which a cooperative usually owns the land the residents buy in, through to urban apartment blocks where tenants rent a room and share spaces including kitchens and rooftops. The set-up can vary, but the through-line is an emphasis on community, sharing and participation, as well as prioritising green housing and sustainable living. One example is in Melbourne, where a new co-living-inspired not-for-profit development called Nightingale creates carbon-neutral properties where owner-occupiers share gardens, laundries, multipurpose spaces and rooms that can be loaned out to visiting friends or family members. The CoHousing Co-op in South Hobart, Tasmania is a social housing venture with 12 homes and one “common house” which houses a kitchen, dining room, lounge area, common laundry, guest flat and office. It is managed by the residents and based on a Danish model of co-housing. While the concept may be age-old, the modern reinvention of collaborative living has picked up steam over the past decade. Proponents believe it could help ease housing and climate crises, as well as solving a more intangible need – the human desire for community. “I think that’s one of the main reasons people gravitate towards these – it’s the social connection,” says Caitlin McGee, a research director with the University of Technology Sydney whose work focuses on sustainable housing. McGee believes “pretty much all demographics” could benefit from the community aspect of collaborative living. “I’m a single parent, I would love to live that way – just to get a bit of help,” McGee says. “There are real positives for single parents around that community support. But also, people are having fewer kids [today]. A lot of people only have one child, and there’s not that sibling experience. So it’s more important to give them community and access to other kids.” McGee believes reimagining the way we approach housing via collaborative living could eventually help millennials and Gen Z locked out of the traditional property market as the idea becomes more widespread with cheaper entry points. At the other end of the age spectrum, collaborative living is particularly well-suited to retirees who want to downsize but still have community around them. And for Australians aged over 75, McGee says it’s increasingly being looked to as “a better alternative to going into an aged care facility” – even piquing the interest of the royal commission into aged care quality and safety. Around 30% of Narara’s residents are aged over 50. For community elder Emily MacLaurin, a retired single grandmother, the chance to live around others was part of Narara’s appeal. “I have faced the prospect of living [alone] like my mother for 30 years. I’m by myself, I don’t want to live like that,” she says. In time, academics such as McGee believe collaborative living may be more affordable than traditional housing options – if not through the cost of land, then the ability to share the cost of resources such as cars, washing machines and lawnmowers, or by forging the relationships that allow you to, say, drop the kids next door instead of pay for a babysitter. But right now, Parris concedes, saving money is not what draws people to Narara. Those wishing to join the community must buy into the co-op at a cost of $30,000. They then buy their lot of land, which typically costs $340,000, though lots can be subdivided to split the cost with others. Residents must then fund the construction of their own home. The dwellings at Narara range from tiny homes to abodes made out of hemp, as well as plenty of sustainable houses that wouldn’t look out of place on a standard suburban street. The more unusual dwellings in their community include an earthship, a house made out of upcycled materials including tyres, and a Tolkienesque dwelling. All up, most residents end up paying close to market value for the chance to move in. Living in close proximity can, however, cause teething issues. Parris says topics such as pet ownership have been divisive in the community, as have debates over Covid vaccination. Stephanie Wainwright, a mother of two, moved to Narara with her partner to raise her family around a community. She says privacy “can be an issue”, with kids prone to showing up on doorsteps at any hour – there are currently around 50 children in the community. “There’s definitely times when you want to escape the village, but it’s always nice to come back,” she says. A native Canadian, she felt isolated living away from family in Newcastle before coming to Narara. “We felt like salmon trying to swim upstream, very alone. We found other salmon.” In inner-city Sydney, a different demographic dominates another kind of collaborative living. At Uko, a chain of co-living apartment spaces, most residents are aged between 25 and 35. Uko launched in 2018 and has already opened 16 complexes in mostly inner-city suburbs, with their apartments aimed at young professionals or digital nomads who need somewhere to land and make friends in a new city. Residents rent small studio apartments and congregate in the shared lounge, laundry, kitchen and rooftops, as well as attend Uko-organised events such as parties and pasta nights. “I used to live in student accommodation. I think this is much better, because people actually come downstairs and talk,” says Khaled Al Meheiri, an international student from Abu Dhabi who lives at Uko’s Newtown branch. While places like Narara are driven by ideology, Uko is a developer-led business model. It’s one that has been a hit – every Uko property is currently full and plans to open another 12 properties are under way. “It’s an industry that is growing,” says Marta Wheeldon, Uko’s general manager. (One of their co-living competitors, Hmlet, has been less successful – it went into liquidation last year.) It’s easier for curious parties to dip in and out of collaborative living at Uko, where they only need to agree to a minimum three-month lease. What’s stalling the growth of more co-housing projects like Narara in Australia is the red tape – and financial investment – that goes into buying as a collective. “[Collaborative living] hasn’t proliferated here and the main reason for that is the inability for a group of people to get construction finance,” says Karen Deegan, an architect who has worked in collaborative living for over 10 years and currently volunteers with CoHousing Australia, a national organisation that advocates for and educates around co-housing. Banks in Australia are not yet au fait with the idea that groups of people might want to buy land together. That means those wishing to create co-housing projects need to turn to specialist lenders, “and that finance is usually quite expensive”, Deegan says. Groups who want to set up their own co-housing communities can struggle to compete financially with deep-pocketed developers, especially in urban areas. Getting the green light from councils can also be an issue, something those in the field believe could be solved by implementing statewide policy around collaborative housing that trumps finicky local laws. Narara Ecovillage avoided the need for a mortgage by raising $4m between its founding members, who they call “pioneers”, to buy their land outright. “If we had a bank involved, we wouldn’t be here today,” Parris says. While CoHousing Australia is currently trying to encourage the idea that property developers could partner with groups who want to build collaborative living communities, Deegan believes Australia could eventually solve the problems that are preventing collaborative living from getting bigger here. “We’ve seen that the model does proliferate in countries once you crack all these systemic issues with lending and councils,” she says. “It [boomed] in the US, and countries throughout Europe, who have similar cultures to us, as soon as those couple of things were sorted out.” For now, the determined minority, such as those at Narara, will have to find ways to make it work. For its residents, the long road to breaking ground was worth it – even with the odd neighbourly dispute. “You get your good moments and you get the odd falling out, like you would with a brother,” retired nurse Lynda Matthews explains as she wipes down a nappy-changing pad as part of her annual working bee hours. “It’s like a big family – that’s the thing that keeps me here.”",Lifestyle/Life and style," ‘I don’t want to live alone’: co-living, community and affordable housing",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/23/i-dont-want-to-live-alone-co-living-community-and-affordable-housing
4/23/2022,"Several Coalition MPs have questioned Senator Claire Chandler’s controversial bill to restrict trans women playing in female sports, calling for caution as they believe it is “redundant” or needs more work. It comes as the Australian Christian Lobby said it expected Chandler’s bill would be revisited in the next parliament. Conservative lobby group Advance Australia has also launched a campaign calling for Coalition moderates Trent Zimmerman, Dave Sharma, Andrew Bragg and Warren Entsch – who it described as “numpties” – to be voted out at the election over their criticism of Warringah candidate, Katherine Deves. Chandler’s legislation, which she called her “save women’s sport” bill, proposes changes to the Sex Discrimination Act to “clarify” that the operation of single-sex sport on the basis of biological sex is not discriminatory. But critics say its aims are already covered by existing laws. Prime minister, Scott Morrison, has expressed support for the proposal, but later noted it was only a private senator’s bill and not government policy. Deves – who founded the advocacy group Save Women’s Sport Australasia – has claimed credit for helping develop Chandler’s “Save Women’s Sport” bill. Several Coalition senators also backed the bill, but others have voiced reservations. South Australian senator Andrew McLachlan said he wanted Chandler’s bill to be examined by a parliamentary committee before coming to a debate or vote. “The private member’s bill proposed by Senator Chandler will be examined by parliamentary committees and these committees will report on the issue and whether legislative intervention is warranted,” he said. Queensland LNP senator Gerard Rennick said he was concerned about safety issues around trans athletes in female competitions, but did not believe the parliament needed to take action. “I hate identity politics, we shouldn’t be using it to score points. Not just the Liberals but Labor too,” he said. Rennick said he wasn’t critical of Chandler, but didn’t support the push. “We should be able to have this conversation without being labelled a bigot but it’s not a debate I want to politicise,” he said. NSW senator Andrew Bragg has said existing law “already addresses this issue” and that he was “not aware of any evidence that the law is deficient”. On Friday, he too called for the bill to be examined before progressing. “Scrutiny of legislation is a key function of the Senate and this non-government bill requires significant scrutiny before it is put to a vote,” he said. “I expect any Senate inquiry will show the bill is redundant due to the current legal provisions on strength, stamina and physique.” Other government moderates, who declined to be named, have told Guardian Australia of their significant concern that Morrison was elevating the controversy during the federal election period, noting that Australia’s sporting codes were managing issues of participation effectively. But Coalition senator Susan McDonald added her voice to senators in favour of the bill, claiming Chandler’s push was “entirely reasonable, and can be done without denying the humanity of transgender people”. “It is wrong to dismiss these concerns or to shame parents and females as somehow being bigoted transphobes for expressing views that a small minority don’t like,” she said. “This is an important discussion to have and it must be done in a respectful and considerate way for both sides of the debate.” Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, this week said legislative change was not needed. “That is covered by the Sex Discrimination Act. It’s covered that girls should be able to play sport against girls and boys should be able to play sport against boys,” he said. “Sports currently are in control of this issue.” Labor MP, Graham Perrett, described the proposal as “a Morrison-culture-division-war special”. “Go and talk to some sporting clubs and schools – they are all over this,” he tweeted. Wendy Francis, the ACL’s national director, said that although Morrison had “distanced himself” from the Chandler bill in the campaign he had strongly backed Deves. “It’s a little bit of back and forward but certainly the support we’ve seen for Katherine Deves’ comments we’ve been grateful for,” she said. Asked if Morrison may restate his earlier support for the Chandler bill after the campaign, Francis said: “I do think so, there’s a growing number of parliamentarians in support of Katherine Deves and that will strengthen Claire Chandler’s arm with her bill.” “I think it will be revisited in the next term of parliament if the Coalition is re-elected, and Labor have a lot of people on the left side of politics concerned about it as well. I don’t see it as an issue going away quickly.” Christian Schools Australia has also backed Chandler’s bill, with director of public policy, Mark Spencer, declaring that “sensible amendments” were needed to enshrine the principle that “girls should be able to play sport against girls” and boys against boys. “Our political leaders are misinformed if they believe that the current provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act provide clear protections to ensure that this can occur – this is simply not the case,” he said in a statement. “Senator Chandler’s bill provides clarity and support for women and girls and it still allows sports to make their own decisions on inclusion – just without the threat of litigation if they ignore the shrill claims of a small number of activists.” Chandler wrote an email to supporters on Friday, claiming “the dam wall has broken” and that her cause had “the support of millions of Australians”. “It was only a matter of time. Female athletes across Australia are speaking up to save women’s sport,” Chandler wrote. “Women around the world have been intimidated into silence for too long, but not any more.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Advance Australia, which campaigned strongly against Warringah MP, Zali Steggall, at the 2019 election, backed Deves and is calling for supporters to vote against Liberal MPs who had criticised her views. “DO NOT let the pathetic “modern Liberal” faction and their buddies in the Climate 200 clique get you down,” the group wrote on its website. “Trent Zimmerman, YOU should be sacked by the people of North Sydney for your woke nonsense … Warren Entsch, YOUR very, very different views are the reason you should be VOTED OUT.

4/23/2022,"Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. On Monday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced the Russian military had begun its long-awaited push to seize the east of Ukraine. As Kyiv’s presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak put it: “The second phase of the war has started.” While Luke Harding covered the developments on the ground, Julian Borger wrote about the 20,000 mercenaries from Syria, Libya and elsewhere deployed by Russian its new offensive. The mercenaries are being thrown into the Russian attempt to capture as much as possible of eastern Ukraine, in what western defence officials have described as a rush to have some sort of victory that Vladimir Putin can announce at the 9 May military parade in Moscow commemorating the second world war, he wrote. The Kremlin is seen as having four objectives in this second phase of its war in Ukraine, the European official said: capturing the Donbas, securing a land bridge to Crimea in which the besieged city of Mariupol is crucial, seizing Kherson oblast to secure a supply of freshwater to Crimea, and capturing additional territory that could be used as a buffer or a bargaining chip in negotiations. For more on the battle for the Donbas, read Ed Ram and Isobel Koshiw on the fall of the town of Kreminna. Isobel and Ed also reported from Chasiv Yar, Donetsk region on the elderly people waiting to be moved out as Russian troops advance. The battle for the key south-eastern Ukraine port of Mariupol has been the focus of the war this week, with the defending forces defying several Russian demands to surrender. Surrounded on sides by Russian troops, the Ukrainians appear to be fighting to the death in their last stronghold in the city’s Azovstal steelworks. A Ukrainian marine commander there said on Wednesday that his forces were “maybe facing our last days, if not hours”. In a dramatic video post on Facebook, Serhiy Volyna, a commander from the 36th separate marine brigade, said: “The enemy is outnumbering us 10 to one. We appeal and plead to all world leaders to help us. We ask them to use the procedure of extraction and take us to the territory of a third-party state.” Putin has since ordered his forces not to storm the last stronghold but to blockade the area “so that a fly can’t get through”. For further coverage of the desperate situation in Mariupol, read Andrew Roth and Luke Harding on claims that Russia has been hiding evidence of its “barbaric” war crimes in Mariupol by burying the bodies of civilians killed by shelling in a new mass grave. Family members of sailors who served onboard the Moskva are demanding answers as the ministry has sought to suppress information about what happened to the ship or its estimated 510-strong crew, report Pjotr Sauer and Andrew Roth. For days after the Moskva cruiser sank in the Black Sea, Yulia Tsyvova had been desperately searching for information about her son Andrei. Like hundreds of other Russian families of crew members, she had not been told whether he had survived the reported Ukrainian missile attack that had sunk the Russian flagship of the Black Sea fleet. Then on Monday morning she received a call from the Russian defence ministry. Her son was dead. “He was only 19, he was a conscript,” said Tsyvova, who wept as she spoke by telephone. “They didn’t tell me anything else, no information on when the funeral would be.”For more on the topic, Andrew Roth also wrote about why the loss of the Moskva is such a blow to Russia. Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer looked at the cost of the war inside Russia as the invasion enters its third month. While Kremlin officials have shown no signs of contrition, some unlikely critics of the war have also grown more outspoken. “I don’t see a SINGLE beneficiary of this mad war!” wrote businessman Oleg Tinkov in a statement on Tuesday. “Innocent people and soldiers are being killed. Generals have woken up from their hangover to understand they have a shit army. And why would the army be good, if everything else in the country is shit and rife with nepotism, lackyism, and servility? On both sides of a polarised Russian society, they write, the failures of the first stage of the war have raised the stakes of the conflict, turning what the Kremlin calls a “special operation” into an existential one. Since Russia’s invasion on 24 February, of the more than 2.5 million people who have entered Poland, about 502,000 are estimated to have returned. Lorcan Lovett travelled to the border to talk to some of those going home. There, he met women making the perilous journey for different reasons. One of them was Ann, a resident of Odesa who had heeded the pleas of her friends abroad and fled to Holland after the war began. A month later, as she tried to calm her son over the phone while Russian missiles shook the Black Sea port city around him, she decided to return. “I couldn’t stick it,” she says. “I needed to get home.” The 50-year-old mother moved through a crowd of women and children at Przemyśl train station in Poland on a Wednesday afternoon to board her train. “I do not care what will happen to me,” Ann said. “If something happens to my family, why do I need to live?” Our visual guide to the invasion is updated regularly and can be found here.

4/23/2022,"Dingoes are genetically distinct from domestic dogs and their evolution has been shaped by Australia’s environment, scientists who have fully decoded the dingo genome have said. An international team of researchers have analysed the genetic makeup of a pure desert dingo called Sandy Maliki, finding that dingoes are an intermediary between wolves and domestic dog breeds. Sandy, with her sister and brother, was discovered as a three-week old pup in the central Australian desert. In 2017 she won a “world’s most interesting genome” competition which funded the DNA sequencing. The researchers compared Sandy’s genome to that of five domestic dog breeds – a basenji, a boxer, a labrador retriever, a German shepherd and a great dane – as well as a Greenland wolf. Using five types of DNA sequencing technology, as well as epigenetic analysis, the researchers found distinctions between the dingo genome and that of domestic dogs. One was a difference in the number of copies of a gene coding for amylase, an enzyme which aids in digesting starchy food. Dingoes, like wolves, only have one copy of the amylase gene. “Breed dogs, which only emerged in the last 200 years, have between two and 20 copies of this gene,” said Matt Field, an associate professor at James Cook University and the study’s first author. “That’s one of the telltale signs of domestication and [in dingoes] it’s not there.” Study co-author Prof Bill Ballard, of La Trobe University, said when humans first began domesticating dogs, they fed the animals rice products, which are high in starch – creating a selective pressure for dogs with multiple copies of the amylase gene. “Those dogs that did better with the rice were … more likely to be associated with humans over time,” he said. Ballard said some scientists had previously thought that “dingoes had lost the ancestral duplications of amylase”. “That was not true. We could look at the signature of the genome and say: no, there’s only ever been one copy of amylase in the dingo, just like the wolf.” The difference could have significant conservation implications, Ballard said. “If a pure dingo eats very different things to a wild dog, then it’s going to have a different position in the ecosystem and … be differentially attracted to different foods.” The decoded dingo genome could also have veterinary applications for domestic dogs, Ballard said. He believes it could be a genetic reference for canine diseases as “rather than another inbred dog that you’re comparing it to, you’re comparing it to a healthy outbred animal”. The team also analysed dingo and German shepherd scat, finding differences in their microbiomes, including that the domestic dog had higher concentrations of three bacterial families involved in breaking down starchy foods. Dr Kylie Cairns of the University of New South Wales, who was not involved in the study, said the microbiome differences could “explain why we are not seeing feral dogs in Australia”. Her previous research has suggested that most wild dogs killed across the country are pure dingoes or dog–dingo hybrids. “[Dingoes] are older than the oldest domestic dog breed, which is the basenji. Their results clearly demonstrated that,” she said. “Dingoes are a wild canid that has been shaped by Australia’s climate and ecology over thousands of years.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The implications of that are that they should be treated like wildlife,” Cairns said. The dingo is “the only native animal that is baited and killed across national parks and conservation reserves” in Australia, she added. “We need to respect their place as the apex predator in Australia, because they have an important ecological role,” Cairns said. “We need to figure out a better way of coexisting with them so that we can have agriculture of livestock – particularly sheep – but that we continue to have dingoes in the environment.” The scientists now plan to find out whether the dingo has ever been domesticated, and also to sequence the genome of the alpine dingo and the Fraser Island dingo. This will help them better understand crossbreeding with dogs and what effect it might have on the animals’ behaviour and role in the ecosystem, Field said. The research was published in the journal Science Advances.",News/Environment,Scientists find dingoes genetically different from domestic dogs after decoding genome,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/23/scientists-find-dingoes-genetically-different-from-domestic-dogs-after-decoding-genome

4/23/2022,"After overcoming significant hardships, refugee kids are no longer detained on Nauru. But some who are now adolescents continue to experience the punitive effects, legal limbo and structural violence of Australia’s deterrence system. Despite their time on Nauru resulting in severe educational gaps, many of these teenage refugees have demonstrated significant academic success in Australia. They have been allowed to complete their high school education, but now find themselves unable to continue with their studies because of their lack of visas. Instead, their residence determination (also known as community detention) bans them from working or studying at Australian universities. Australian universities provide subsidised places for domestic students or full-fee places for international students. Refugee students on temporary visas – such as bridging visa Es or temporary protection visas – are categorised as international students and are not eligible for subsidised commonwealth-supported places. This means refugee adolescents face significant barriers to accessing tertiary education, even when they are legally permitted to study, and must rely on university scholarships to be able to afford it. In 2018, Sukirtha Krishnalingam, a 19-year-old Sri Lankan refugee was medevaced from Nauru to Melbourne due to her critical health condition. She completed the Victorian Certificate of Education in 2021 and was offered a full-tuition scholarship to study a double degree in commerce-arts at Deakin University, a scholarship to RMIT University as well as an offer from Monash University. She had to decline all these opportunities because she is subject to ministerial residential determination and is barred from study. Under the Tertiary Education Quality Standards Agency, refugees and asylum seekers are not included as an equity group. Dr Karen Dunwoodie, the deputy director at the Centre for Refugee Employment, Advocacy, Training and Education at Deakin University, says when the universities consider admission based on equity criteria, they tend to focus on student deficiencies and fail to recognise the value of a refugee’s prior qualifications, skills and experiences. She explains that some higher education institutions claim they do not have the resources to customise their services for a small cohort of refugee students, such as providing one-on-one case management with specialist trauma-informed health professionals. “We have a long way to go in recognising the distinct needs of students from refugee and seeking-asylum backgrounds despite the increasing number of Australian universities offering specific scholarships for this cohort. Classification as an international student and homogenisation of support services, compounds the effects of an often-difficult student journey, prior to enrolling as well as during their tertiary studies,” Dunwoodie says. Displaced youth’s multifaceted challenges are evident in the circumstances of Iranian refugee sisters Alma*, 19, and Anashid*, 21, whose exposure to domestic violence and family separation prevented them from completing the HSC. Alma and Anashid were six and seven years old when their parents split in Iran. After their father remarried, they fled persecution in Iran and arrived on Christmas Island in 2013. The family was initially transferred to Nauru, but they were moved to Darwin detention after their stepmother became pregnant. In 2016, their family was placed in community detention in Melbourne. The sustained stress on the family caused conflict between the sisters and their stepmother; in 2019 their father received an apprehended violence order and was sent back to detention. The sisters then lived with foster carers. This family arrangement has significantly impacted Alma’s mental health, resulting in her being admitted twice to a mental health unit in a hospital. The mental health clinician reported Alma’s symptoms manifested in restricted intake, school refusal and suicidal attempts. She “feels that it is not worth having a life if she doesn’t have any freedom of choices”. Despite the setbacks, her ongoing determination was recognised and she received the assistant principal’s award in year 12. Even when students are supported by powerful advocates, the system can be impossible to navigate. Dozens of teachers and scholars, including the Greens’ spokesperson for education, Senator Mehreen Faruqi, urged the immigration minister to grant 20-year-old Iranian refugee a bridging visa that would allow her to study or receive a university scholarship. To date, the requests have remained unanswered. In 2018, the federal court ordered that the Iraninan refugee, accompanied by her mother and sister “on an urgent basis”, should be transferred from Nauru to Australia for her medical treatment. In the case of 21-year-old Iranian refugee Armin Aslani Faal, he was forced to choose between joining his family for resettlement in the US or completing his degree in Australia where he fought to be allowed to study. Armin’s family were transferred from offshore detention on Nauru to a Brisbane immigration detention centre in 2014 for his and his mother’s medical treatment. For the next three years, they remained in various immigration detention centres in Australia. After their mental health deteriorated, they were released to community detention in 2016. In Sydney, Armin achieved academic success at school and received prestigious awards. In 2018, he received several offers and scholarships from the University of Technology Sydney, Macquarie University, Western Sydney University and a residency at the University of Wollongong. Armin’s self-advocacy triumphed when the minister of immigration, in an unusual act, used his ministerial discretion and granted him a bridging visa with the right to enrol in a bachelor of pharmacy at the University of Sydney in 2018, while the rest of his family remained barred from study. Despite being in the final years of his course, his family has been given minimal time to accept the US resettlement offers last month which would mean Armin’s fight for his education rights and four years’ of education will be wasted. He says he will have no choice but to start his educational journey from scratch due to the different pharmacy course requirements in the US. This month, a letter was sent to the immigration minister from 479 members of the Refugee Education Special Interest Group, a network of Australian and international academics and educators. It calls on the minister to facilitate access to tertiary education for refugees subject to residence determinations, through, for example, issuing them bridging visas with study rights. Dr Sara Dehm, one of the letter’s co-authors along with Dr Sally Baker, says international law recognises that everyone has a right to an education, including refugees. This right extends to higher education, which ought to be accessible to all. The discriminatory policy prevents young refugees from having the same opportunities as other Australian high school graduates. The western gaze might judge policies in other countries such as the Taliban’s gender segregation in Afghanistan or Iran’s systematic exclusion of students who don’t comply with the state’s hardline values. However, an exclusionary strategy is executed in Australia on these displaced youths as well.

4/23/2022,"Victoria will delay repealing public drunkenness as a crime, in a move that has triggered the state’s Indigenous legal service to urge the state government to prioritise the “overdue reform”. The offence was to be officially repealed in November, but Guardian Australia understands the decriminalisation of public drunkenness may not take effect until 2023 – more than five years after the death of 55-year-old Yorta Yorta woman Tanya Day. Day had been arrested in December 2017 after being found drunk on a train, and later died in hospital from head injuries sustained in a prison holding cell. Last year, the Andrews government passed landmark legislation that would decriminalise public drunkenness in line with a recommendation made after a coronial inquiry into Day’s death. But on Friday, the state government said delays in establishing trials of sobering-up centres – as part of a shift to a health-based response – meant that the decriminalisation of public drunkenness would be pushed back. The delay has been attributed to Covid-related pressures on the health system. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service said it was “disappointed” decriminalisation would not occur in November but stressed the government should “utilise” the delay to ensure it embraces a model that is based on a health response and does not include police as first responders to intoxicated people. “Every extra day it takes to implement this reform is another day that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are being targeted and locked up under the existing laws,” it said in a statement. “There must be no further delays.” The Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service (VALS) chief executive, Nerita Waight, urged the government to urgently prioritise the reform. “Aboriginal communities in Victoria have waited long enough for this reform … our people continue to be disproportionately locked up for public intoxication. It is only a matter of time before we lose another member of our communities,” she said. Waight said the government’s “tough on crime” policies disproportionately affected Indigenous people, with Aboriginal women the fastest growing demographic of the state’s prisons. “The government must fix the over-incarceration of our people by properly implementing the decriminalisation of public intoxication, fixing Victoria’s broken bail laws and raising the age of criminal responsibility,” she said. Day’s family and the VALS have argued police should not be involved as first responders as part of the reform. The state’s attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, said the Victorian government remained dedicated to implementing a “health-based model” to ensure people who are intoxicated in public could “access the care and support they need”. “This work is too important to not get right – we must make sure there’s time to test and develop the new model so it’s effective, safe and culturally appropriate,” she said in a statement. “We will continue to engage with our Aboriginal community stakeholders, health services and first responders to work through these delays and get these reforms right.” The government’s health-based model will be informed by the trial of sobering-up centres in four locations – the City of Yarra, the City of Greater Dandenong, the City of Greater Shepparton and in Castlemaine. Guardian Australia understands the government will aim to establish the trial sites –funded with an investment of $26.4m – by the middle of the year. The Police Association of Victoria had previously warned that decriminalising public drunkenness before a replacement system to deal with the issue was “dangerous virtue signalling”.

She hit her head at least five times in a holding cell while left unattended and died in hospital from a brain haemorrhage less than three weeks later. The Victorian coroner in 2020 concluded police officers had failed to adequately check Day’s safety and wellbeing, saying an indictable offence may have been committed. No charges have been laid over the death. Victoria and Queensland are the only jurisdictions in Australia that have a specific offence for public drunkenness, which the 1991 royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody found had disproportionately affected Indigenous people, and recommended that it be abolished. Of the 99 deaths investigated in the commission, 35% involved Aboriginal people who were detained in relation to public intoxication.",News/Australia news,Decriminalisation of public drunkenness delayed by Victorian government,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/23/decriminalisation-of-public-drunkenness-delayed-by-victorian-government
4/23/2022,"Experts fear cases of drink spiking may be on the rise across Australia as bars and clubs reopen to capacity crowds as Covid restrictions ease. The issue has hit the headlines again recently. In Melbourne, several women recently spoke out after reporting their drinks being tampered with on nights out in popular nightclub districts Brunswick and Chapel Streets. Meanwhile, in Perth, a man who allegedly met up with women through online dating sites and spiked their drinks before sexually assaulting them appeared in court last week. A recent court case in Brisbane also highlighted the issue. Drug and alcohol experts say that venues can follow simple rules to help keep patrons safe. But how do you detect it and what can be done to crack down on drink spiking? Here is everything you need to know: Drink spiking is when someone puts another substance – which is usually alcohol – into a person’s drink without them knowing. “Most commonly drink spiking is with other alcohol, partly because it’s easy to conceal alcohol in another alcoholic drink,” says Nicole Lee, a professor at the National Drug Research Institute. This might look like increasing the number of shots in a drink, like a cocktail, without another person knowing. Other depressant drugs are also used, but are less common. Lee says drugs can be “colourless and odourless, so they’re not detected until you consume them”. “There have been incidents of Rohypnol, ketamine, and GHB being used. Those drugs are clear and don’t smell.” “The whole purpose of spiking is to incapacitate a person,” says Hayley Foster, the CEO of Full Stop Australia, a group that provides counselling to support people affected by sexual violence. “Often, it is to reduce that person’s ability to resist sexual advances.” Lee says people do use drink spiking to commit sexual assault, but often it’s used to “prank” people. Four out of five victims are women, with half the victims being under 24 years old. “Obviously there are definitely people who spike women’s drinks to commit a sexual assault or abuse them in some way, but a lot of drink spiking is just pranking someone,” Lee says. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Historically, drink spiking incidents have always been very under-reported. Often victims won’t report drink spiking incidents because they are worried people won’t believe them, or they think they will be blamed for what happened – especially if they were already drinking or taking drugs, says Laura Bajurny, a knowledge manager for policy and advocacy at the Alcohol and Drug Foundation. Women are the usual targets, and Bajurny says one-third of spiking incidents are related to sexual assault. But incidents of spiking remain “very under-reported”. “There can be so much victim blaming and second-guessing,” Bajurny says. “Especially if they had been drinking or using other drugs at the time.” “But there is a world of difference between choosing to consume alcohol or drugs, and consuming them against your will. And no one should have that choice taken away.” Foster says Full Stop received an influx of calls as Covid restrictions eased in Sydney at the end of 2021 and young people began going out and on dates “for the first time in a long time”. Among them, the New South Wales based sexual violence hotline noticed a “marked increase” in calls related to spiking. “Often, callers will be unsure if they have in fact been assaulted,” Foster says. “They might not remember anything, or might even blame themselves.” For many people, it may feel like becoming really intoxicated really quickly, even if you haven’t had much to drink. “You hear cases of people who lose feeling in their legs … and their senses have been affected,” Foster says. “People wake up in someone else’s apartment and don’t remember how they got there.” There are warning signs you can look out for during a night out, like: Feeling dizzy or faint Feeling ill or sleepy Feeling drunk even if you’ve only had a small amount of alcohol Passing out Waking up feeling uncomfortable and confused, with memory blanks about the night before “If you experience any of these symptoms, stop drinking and … make sure you are with someone you trust,” Lee says. “Ask the bar staff or the security staff as they might be able to help.” Lee says solutions were “delicate to navigate” because the entire onus shouldn’t be on the person to protect themselves from it happening. The real solution, Bajurny says, is for cultural change to occur. “Until we finally see that change in culture, there are simple safety precautions you can take while enjoying a night out.” “Make sure you keep your drink close to you, don’t share drinks with other people, especially if you haven’t seen where it’s come from.” Lee says. Bajurny says, when out with someone new, buy or pour your own drinks. If your date or a stranger offers you a drink, accompany them to the bar. Watch the bartender prepare your drink, and take the drink from the bartender yourself. Watch out for if the drink they order is different to what you requested, and stop drinking if you think it tastes weird. Also avoid sharing drinks. And don’t let your drink out of your sight – especially if you have to leave it for any reason, like going to the toilet or dancing. This includes water. If you come back from elsewhere to your unfinished drink, do not finish it. If you can, choose drinks in bottles with lids that you can close shut and keep with you when moving. But just because you are holding on to a drink does not make it safe. Be wary of strangers moving around you. When in a crowd with a drink, hold your cup with your hand covering the top. If a venue offers shared water, take note of the type of jug it is in. It is safer to drink from shared jugs if they are closed and accessible by a tap, rather than a pourable jug open at the top. If you can order your own water from the bar, do so. Caution should also be taken with shared jugs of alcohol brought to tables. If you think water or alcohol from a shared jug tastes weird, do not finish it. Foster urges people to plan “a strategy with friends”. Let a trusted person know your whereabouts, who will check in on you and who you can reach out to if feeling uneasy, uncomfortable or unwell. Bystanders also have a role to play. “If you are a person in the world, and you see a situation that feels off … tell the staff you are concerned,” Bajurny says. “Even if you feel paranoid, speaking up can prevent something awful happening to another person.” “A properly trained bartender … will pour drinks on the counter, not behind, so you can see what is going into them,” Lee says. Venues taking precaution “will go a long way” to stopping spiking, Lee says. Drink spiking is a criminal offence in all Australian states and territories. Penalties include imprisonment – ranging from two to 25 years. “Most jurisdictions have specific spiking laws – so you can’t spike food or drink with anything,” Lee says. “The consequences of the laws are different in each state. In Victoria, it’s two years’ imprisonment”. Queensland has up to 14 years’ imprisonment if the perpetrator is found to have spiked someone’s drink to commit a crime, such as sexual assault. Lee says that the charge of drink spiking is separate to a charge of sexual assault. “If you have been sexually assaulted you should report it to the police and to the hospital to make sure you’re OK,” she says.",News/Australia news,How do you detect drink spiking and what can be done about it?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/23/how-do-you-detect-drink-spiking-and-what-can-be-done-about-it
4/23/2022,"Ruth Shaw has embodied many roles throughout her life: pig farmer, navy deserter, solo sailor, illegal gambler, environmentalist, chef to archbishops, psychiatric patient, failed escort. She’s been arrested twice and married four times. But the descriptor she appears most proud of is matchmaker. “I suppose I really am that,” she muses with obvious delight. “Yes, I match humans with books.” The 75-year-old New Zealander’s life has been a constant whirl of phone interviews since releasing her memoir, The Bookseller at the End of the World, earlier this month. Yes, there are booksellers living further south in the world than her (there are several bookshops in the small city of Invercargill, at the southernmost tip of New Zealand), but none are as remote as Shaw’s, nestled on her property in the country’s deep south of Fiordland, on the banks of Lake Manapōuri. The Wee Bookshop is just that: a cheerily painted toy town shack with a brass captains bell on the door, and a sign that reads: “Open, please ring bell loudly if I am not here”. Once inside, Shaw concedes she’s almost as likely to give you a book as sell you one. “I really don’t care if they don’t buy anything,” she says. “I’m lucky – I’m retired and I don’t need to sell the books. But when somebody finds a book and shares it and everybody’s laughing or making comments about it, it is just such a wonderful feeling. That’s why I give away so many books … I’ll ask, ‘Well, what do you like?’ And then I’ll think, ‘oh, I know the perfect book for that person’.” Shaw describes a customer she had earlier in the day. The man had grudgingly appeared in the Wee Bookshop with his wife more than two years ago, and she sent him away with a copy of John Hall-Jones’ Goldfields of Otago: An Illustrated History. “He came back today and said: ‘At the time I didn’t think you knew what you were talking about. But I’ve come to buy another copy because I’ve read it so many times it’s worn out and the back is broken’. “That gives me so much joy,” she says. “I know I’m doing my job, I’m giving my readers something that they will hold really close.” At the height of the summer tourist season, the cars and campervans parked outside Shaw’s home are sometimes deemed a traffic hazard. Soon after opening four years ago, the Wee Bookshop became Two Wee Bookshops, to handle the overflow. A dedicated children’s library shed was built, where young readers could stretch out on the floor. And then, two years ago, she opened another – this time inspired by what she saw as a male reluctance to read. As she writes in her book: Many men sit in their vehicles while their wives or partners come into the shop to browse … one man tooted his horn after a while; others just passive-aggressively start the car, or hover on the doorstep asking, ‘Ready to leave yet … I’m still waiting for you’. But you should never rush a book purchase. “I think I need another bookshop,” she told fourth husband, Lance. “Oh god, will you ever stop?” was his response. The couple are supposed to be retired. The Snug was duly erected: an open-air, gumboot-friendly space built under an old lacebark tree, with a covered verandah. Its shelves are stacked with, as Shaw puts it, “books on hunting, fishing, farming, tractors and trains … and maps in a drawer”. (And old copies of Playboy in another, joked Lance at the time.) Shaw’s bookshops make up only a small part of her memoir, a book interspersed with heartwarming and occasionally heartbreaking vignettes detailing unexpected encounters with humans who cross her threshold – a traumatised NSW firefighter; a barely literate young man; a woman Shaw refuses to sell to, who only wants to buy books of certain colours to go with her decor. But it is also the story of Shaw’s unconventional, adventurous and at times extraordinarily tragic life. Shaw was raised in a loving conservative Catholic family across various rural and urban locations around New Zealand’s South Island, in the 1950s and 1960s. At the age of 17, she was raped in the back of a bus outside a dance hall. Her attacker was a local boy, assisted by two of his friends. A confrontation between Shaw’s father and that boy resulted in the handing over of a £50 note, which her father passed on to her. She writes: The crisp banknote didn’t solve anything; it only raised raw, hurtful questions. Was that the going price for the rape, or my silence? Two months later she discovered she was pregnant. The £50 was used to cover her living expenses while she was sent away to Wellington to hide the pregnancy from family and friends. Her son was born in April 1964. He was removed from her immediately at birth, and Shaw never saw him. It was a trauma and heartbreak that would see her running scared from relationships and permanent roots for the next 20 years – and it wasn’t until the late 1980s that she finally tracked down her only surviving child, Andrew. A year after the birth of her son, Shaw enlisted as a Wren in the New Zealand navy, stationed in Auckland. But she baulked at the discipline, routine and limited roles offered to women in the defence forces of the 1960s, and, desperate to see her family, who were by then running the only hotel on remote Stewart Island/Rakiura, she went awol. Shaw travelled the length of the North Island before being arrested while attempting to cross Cook Strait and being hauled back to base. It took another six months to convince the navy to discharge her. It was on Stewart Island she met “the love of my life”, Lance, a young fisherman. But as a Protestant, he was unable to accept the Shaw family’s insistence that their children should be raised Catholic. The marriage was called off after the invitations had gone out, and the final fitting of the dress had been completed. (It would be 20 years and three husbands later before Shaw heard a vaguely familiar voice down the other end of the phone: “You still a Catholic?”) Shaw fled north and got a job as chef to the Archbishop of Wellington (she had honed her cooking skills in her parent’s hotel on Stewart Island), but the underlying heartbreak over her lost child haunted her, and she had slipped into a pattern of restlessness. Soon she was sailing the Pacific, working as an unpaid cook on a yacht named for the famous clipper ship Cutty Sark. When the boat was slipped for maintenance in Papeete, Tahiti, she was broke. Without speaking the lingo and unable to find work, she began running an illegal card game racket at a local market. She was arrested by Tahitian authorities and ordered to leave the island, but not before a marriage proposal from one of the Cutty Sark’s crew members, Australian journalist “Peter” (Shaw has changed many names in her book to protect privacy). The couple married onboard and landed in Brisbane; Shaw believed her transient lifestyle might be over. But little over a year later – when she was pregnant with her second child – Peter was killed in a car accident. Their baby, Joshua, lived for just 13 hours before succumbing to rhesus disease. “The Ruth I projected to everyone was only skin deep; the inner Ruth was in complete turmoil,” she writes in the book. “Yet my survival instincts kicked in again; like a wild animal I was preparing to turn and run as fast as I could … I knew I needed to get as far away from the nightmare as possible.” A month later, Shaw was living in Papua New Guinea, working as a cook in a Rabaul hotel, and as an illegal bookie’s penciller on the side. Fleeing another offer of marriage from fellow expatriate Matt, she joined the crew of the nine-metre sloop Islander. In the Java sea the vessel was boarded by Indonesian pirates. Armed with three automatic rifles and what Shaw assumed might be a bazooka, they ransacked the boat as the Islander crew sat hostage in the cockpit. “They loaded the whiskey, clothing, food, boat gear and fuel into their runabout, and then they actually shook our hands and politely thanked us,” Shaw tells the Guardian. “So I asked them if I could take their photo.” The pirates pointed their weapons away from crew and struck a pose. “One of them even smiled for me,” Shaw says. Slipping the Islander in Singapore, Shaw was once more on dry land and broke. A fellow backpacker introduced her to an escort service, assuring her the sex part was optional with the mainly wealthy Chinese businessmen clientele. The madam looked the skinny flat-chested New Zealander up and down and pronounced: “Small, no titties, no nice clothes, maybe no good.” That night on her first assignment, when her client asked how much for sex, she panicked and fled. “Told you, you no good,” was the madam’s verdict the next day, as she was sacked. Shaw returned to Papua New Guinea to marry Matt, and began running a cafe. But the marriage lasted only a few years and at the age of 28 she found herself back in a presbytery kitchen, cooking for priests in south-east Melbourne. Shaw recalls those days as some of her darkest. A suicide attempt and a stint in a psychiatric hospital followed. Upon recovery Shaw landed in northern NSW and found herself in her third ill-fated marriage, living on a semi-rural property nurturing her newly found hobby of pig rearing. After it ended she took to the seas again: this time on her own nine-metre yacht Magic. She ended up in Tasmania, standing alongside Bob Brown in the early 1980s in a bid to stop the construction of the Franklin Dam; and then in Sydney, hired as a welfare officer to sex workers by Sydney City Mission, working the beat of Kings Cross in the era of Abe Saffron, Roger Rogerson and Neddy Smith. “Rogerson was a very charming man,” she recalls. “But he used that charm to get what he wanted out of people. The bottom line – he was a psychopath.” In June 2020, one of New Zealand’s most respected broadcasters, Kim Hill, interviewed Shaw about her Manapōuri bookstore. The story of how she got there, and her extraordinary life – where grief and a sense of failure and loss had kept her on the move for decades – enthralled Hill’s audiences, and the journalist urged her to start writing her memoir. Within days, Shaw was approached by Australian publisher Allen & Unwin with an offer. The writing was a joyful, confronting and at time intensely painful experience, she admits. “I was brought up Catholic, expected to get married, have children and lead a reasonably sane life,” she says. “Looking back, I know I felt at the time that my life was totally insane and out of control. And it just seemed that every decision I made was the wrong one.” Now truly anchored, Shaw believes the events of her life have shaped who she is as a septuagenarian bookseller: determined, focused, hard to live with, deeply emotional, loyal, and not easy to love, as she concludes in her memoir. “There are too many books I love to ever pick a favourite, a life full of so many wonderful books,” she says. But amongst the most cherished are Richard Bach’s Jonathan Livingston Seagull, a poetic exploration of the consequences of choosing a life that dances to a different beat; and the children’s classic, The Velveteen Rabbit, about a stuffed toy that yearns to become real. Shaw has learnt to accept the wisdom the always truthful Skin Horse gives to his rabbit friend: “Real isn’t how you are made, it’s a thing that happens to you.” Does it hurt, asks the rabbit? “Sometimes, but when you are Real you don’t mind being hurt.” The Bookseller at the End of the World is out now through Allen & Unwin",Arts/Books,"Pirates, pigs and sex work: the extraordinary life of a bookseller at the end of the world",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/23/pirates-pigs-and-sex-work-the-extraordinary-life-of-a-bookseller-at-the-end-of-the-world
4/23/2022,"Victorian premier Daniel Andrews has reignited calls for the commonwealth to extend its increased health funding for Covid, warning the effects of the pandemic will not end after winter. But the state opposition has lashed the Andrews government, saying the pressure has been caused by “years of Labor mismanagement” prior to the pandemic. The call for extended funding comes as pressure builds on the state government over Victoria’s over-burdened ambulance service ahead of next month’s state budget. Depleted staffing levels in the state’s triple-zero service has left it plagued by lengthy call-wait times, with the state coroner investigating reports of people dying while waiting for calls to be picked up The commonwealth last month extended the Covid-19 National Partnership Agreement to 30 September. The agreement supports the state and territory health systems respond to the pandemic, with a further $982.5m committed in the May federal budget. On Friday, Andrews said Victoria required the additional funding to catch up on deferred care such as elective surgery that had been pushed back during the pandemic. “I would again, urge the prime minister and the federal treasurer to reconsider that $1.5bn cut to health that occurs in September,” Andrews said. “This will not be over in September.” Under the agreement – where the commonwealth funds 50% of Covid-related health costs – Victoria received an additional $1.56bn this financial year. Andrews said Victoria would have to deal with increased demand on the healthcare system due to people delaying routine check ups that “isn’t necessarily obvious to us now.” “Plus, there’s a big challenge in getting elective surgery,” he said. The state’s elective surgery waitlist ballooned during the pandemic, with 80,000 people on the elective surgery waitlist at the end of December. The Victorian president of the Australian Medical Association, Roderick McRae, has warned the waitlist may have risen to as high as 120,000. The Andrews government this month unveiled a $1.5bn package to help clear the backlog of deferred elective surgery procedures Reacting to the premier’s calls for the funding extension, the opposition’s health spokesperson, Georgie Crozier, said Victorians were “sick of Daniel Andrews’ excuses and blame shifting”. “This crisis was caused by years of Labor mismanagement prior to Covid. To now blame shift is simply playing politics instead of pursuing the reforms needed to fix Victoria’s health crisis,” Crozier said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Stephen Duckett, a former head of the federal department of health, said the 50:50 funding model should remain in place to help states catch up on elective surgeries that had been paused to ensure there was enough hospital capacity for Covid patients. “You don’t want to make it unlimited, but you might say it goes at least into the next financial year,” he said. The Age reported in February that the governments of NSW, Victoria and Queensland had all petitioned the commonwealth for a 50:50 funding split for all costs. Under the current agreement, the federal government contributes 45% of hospital funding, but also places a cap when growth rises above 6.5%. The Australian Medical Association – which supports a 50:50 split – has estimated the change and removal of the cap would cost the commonwealth $20.5bn across a four-year period. A spokesperson for the federal health minister, Greg Hunt – who will leave politics after next month’s election – said the Coalition had doubled funding for public hospitals since it was elected in 2013. “Two weeks ago, in the 2022-23 budget, the Morrison government boosted public hospital funding by a record $10bn over four years, a record single investment into health by any government in Australian history,” the spokesperson said. “Despite commonwealth funding more than doubling since 2012-13, Victorian government funding for their own hospitals has only grown by 69%. There is nothing stopping the Victorian government funding their hospitals appropriately by matching the commonwealth’s growth in funding.” The latest report by the national productivity watchdog found Victoria spends less money for each person in the public hospital system than any other jurisdiction in the country and fell below the national average on key benchmarks even before the pandemic began.",News/Australia news,"Covid funding to states should be extended, Daniel Andrews says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/23/covid-funding-to-states-should-be-extended-daniel-andrews-says
4/23/2022,"The peopling of the Pacific is one of the most significant migrations in human history. And now an archaeological discovery on a small island in Papua New Guinea has recast the early scope of this settlement, in a finding archaeologists say could explain the migration east three millennia ago. The unearthing of animal bones and tools on Brooker Island, 200km east of mainland Papua New Guinea, suggests that the migration of Lapita people throughout Papua New Guinea was far more extensive than previously thought. The Lapita – a group with east Asian ancestry – are archaeologically recognised as the first people to make landfall on the islands of Remote Oceania, which include Tonga, Samoa and Vanuatu. They are believed to have migrated there from south-east Asia, via the Bismarck archipelago off the north-eastern coast of New Guinea between 3,100 and 3,350 years ago. Lapita-linked groups are known to have introduced pottery, animals such as pigs and chickens, and Austronesian languages to New Guinea, which has been inhabited by Indigenous people for at least 50,000 years. In new research published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution, archaeologists believe they have unearthed the earliest evidence for Lapita-introduced animals and imported obsidian – volcanic glass – in southern New Guinea. The findings are between 3,060 and 3,480 years old, they estimate. Dr Ben Shaw of the Australian National University, the study’s first author, said the discovery was evidence of the “initial interaction between Indigenous populations, who were already in the area, and Lapita migrants”. “There were other changes to social systems on the island at that time which indicate there were changes to way people were living there,” Shaw said. “This is a signature that’s new in archaeology, particularly in this part of New Guinea,” Shaw said. “[Lapita] didn’t stay in this area and efforts were therefore put towards going further eastward, which resulted in the colonisation of uninhabited Pacific islands like Vanuatu and all the way out to Tonga and Samoa.” The researchers argue that the “interaction with Indigenous populations during this time was pivotal in influencing island-hopping strategies that culminated in the initial peopling of Remote Oceania”. “Similarly rapid but later Lapita dispersals through southern New Guinea and perhaps across the Torres Strait Islands and along the east coast of Australia, did not, therefore, occur through a terra incognita but were probably facilitated by earlier frontier interactions with Indigenous populations,” they wrote. The team found evidence on Brooker Island for the introduction of pigs and dogs by Lapita, which was accompanied by concurrent changes in behaviour such as the use of turtle shells to make tools, and the targeted harvesting of marine animals. “The contemporary presence of lithic axe-adze technologies unrelated to those associated with Lapita suggests that Indigenous cultural influences contributed to cultural diversity in the region despite language replacement,” the researchers wrote. Shaw said Austronesian languages, which were introduced by Lapita groups, are spoken on most of the islands of Papua New Guinea. “Although these islands have got a very long history of Indigenous occupation, and what the archaeology tells us is that there’s continued input of cultural influence from those Indigenous populations … there was a complete changeover from the Indigenous languages that would have been spoken there to the ones that are now spoken,” he said.",News/World news,New clues shed light on ‘pivotal’ moment in the great Pacific migration,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/23/new-clues-shed-light-on-pivotal-moment-in-the-great-pacific-migration
4/23/2022,"As controversy swirls around the Liberal party’s controversial candidate in the seat of Warringah, Katherine Deves, local party officials insist they are witnessing an influx of support from donors and volunteers. “This has been a godsend,” one Warringah branch official tells the Guardian. Deves’ candidacy has prompted a firestorm of criticism from LGBTQ+ groups, caused infighting within the Liberal party, and led to calls for her to be disendorsed by senior Coalition figures after an avalanche of press about transphobic tweets which surfaced after her nomination. Deves has gone to ground since the tweets emerged, yet in interviews with more than a dozen local party members, officials and state executive representatives, it is clear many in the party see an opportunity in the negative coverage. “Once this pile-on with the trans stuff reached hurricane proportions and you had a number of people on our own side coming out and saying ‘this is terrible’, we had a bunch more people coming out wanting to volunteer and donate,” a branch official says. “The influx of people wanting to contribute financially has been incredible. We would have had to spend a quarter of a million dollars to get name recognition like this.” Another senior party member in Warringah agrees, telling the Guardian members had been attracted to Deves after Scott Morrison defended her through the week. “People don’t like the woke ‘cancel culture’ stuff and this has played into that,” he says. While it is not possible to verify claims about campaign contributions, even moderate Liberals who have stayed away from Deves’ campaign concede there is anecdotal evidence to suggest some of the party faithful have been attracted to the campaign. One senior party member volunteering in the neighbouring seat of North Sydney says that campaign has lost supporters, who have decided to give their time to Warringah. “I haven’t seen their finances, but it would not surprise me in the slightest [if support had increased],” the official says. Though anecdotal, the accounts from party members – who spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity because of party rules banning officials from speaking on the record – suggest that, at least for some, the Coalition’s attempt to pivot away from discussion about Deves’ transphobic comments by making it a debate about “cancel culture” have been effective. And there is no denying Deves is enjoying a level of publicity most candidates can only dream of. Media monitoring data compiled for the Guardian shows that between 10 and 21 April, Deves had more mentions across metro and regional print and online news than any Liberal frontbencher, bar Morrison. During that 11-day period, Deves was mentioned in 1,126 different articles, a figure that removes examples of syndication. The most commonly mentioned Coalition minister after Morrison was the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, with 1,044. For mentions in the first 100 words of an article, the divide was more pronounced. Deves was mentioned in the first 100 words of 641 separate articles, while the next closest frontbencher was the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, with 360. It’s a remarkable statistic. It was only months ago that Deves was unknown – not only to the general public but also within the party she is now representing in what was a blue-ribbon Liberal seat, until independent Zali Steggall’s victory over Tony Abbott in 2019. Though she had previously been a member, Deves rejoined the Liberal party months before nominating to stand in the seat, and had to receive special dispensation from the New South Wales state executive to run. None of the Warringah party members interviewed for this piece had met her before about February, when she began attending branch meetings. That Deves benefited from the calamitous preselection process in NSW in the build up to the election is unquestioned. Amid an intractable factional stoush, head office scrambled to find a star candidate who might unseat Steggall, including the former NSW premiers Gladys Berejiklian and Mike Baird. When that didn’t work, both the moderates and the right wing of the party threw their support behind the disability advocate David Brady and defence analyst Lincoln Parker, respectively. Though Deves had no formal factional backing, the Guardian understands members of the centre right began gravitating to her as a potential “circuit breaker” candidate. One senior Warringah source says Morrison – also a member of the centre right – “picked up the vibe”. “Neither Lincoln nor Dave Brady were the kind of candidate we really needed here, and then here comes this woman who’s smart, articulate, not at all a ‘politician’, and she looks like a movie star,” the source said. “She was the perfect candidate.” While Deves has been promoted as an advocate for women’s sport, it’s unclear whether, due to her hurried nomination, senior figures in the Liberal party – including Morrison – were aware of the extent of her transphobic comments. She has previously described Wear it Purple Day – which celebrates gender diversity – as a “grooming tactic”, described trans children as “surgically mutilated and sterilised”, and claimed as recently as January this year that there is “no such thing as a ‘trans female’” only “males with trans identities”. Deves was forced to issue two separate apologies over the “language and the hurt that I have caused” in some of the comments that have appeared in the media. She also routinely misgendered trans athletes, including Laurel Hubbard and Hannah Mouncey. And she has also criticised the federal and state Coalition governments. She regularly criticised the NSW Coalition for its “draconian” Covid-19 policies, called for the prime minister to “sort out the vaccine rollout”, and also criticised incoming health minister Anne Rushton (whom she mistakenly called Jane) over an answer to a question about women’s safety. Though the Guardian understands some vetting was conducted by a third-party firm, the tweets were not raised because Deves had already deleted her accounts on both Twitter and Facebook. Indeed, there is almost no online record of Deves prior to October 2020, when her Save Women’s Sport Australasia group was established. She previously worked in marketing, reportedly for Treasury Wine Estates, and qualified as a practising lawyer last year. One Coalition MP who was certainly familiar with Deves was the Tasmanian senator Claire Chandler. This week the Guardian revealed Deves claimed a key role in developing legislation to exclude trans women from women’s sport slammed by equality advocates as “divisive and unnecessary”. The two women have regularly appeared at events and on Sky News together, while Deves has referred to her glowingly as “the one politician brave enough to speak publicly” about the “destruction of women’s rights”. While Morrison – and other senior frontbenchers including Angus Taylor – continue to support Deves, whether voters in Warringah and other moderate seats such as North Sydney and Wentworth will punish the Coalition is another question.

4/23/2022,"Australian Christian Lobby flyers targeting moderate Liberals who crossed the floor to amend the religious discrimination bill to protect LGBTIQ+ people have prompted complaints to the charities regulator that argue the material breaches rules on political campaigning. Leaflets distributed by the ACL depict Liberals Trent Zimmerman, Dave Sharma, Bridget Archer, Fiona Martin, and independent MP Rebekha Sharkie driving a wrecking ball into a church or school. In February, the MPs voted for amendments to the religious discrimination bill aimed at protecting LGBTIQ+ students to the Sex Discrimination Act. The flyers single out the MPs who “voted against protecting people of faith from discrimination” and says the MPs “voted to remove laws that protect the values of faith-based schools”. The reverse of the flyers, first reported by Guardian Australia on Tuesday, asks voters whether “attacks on Christianity and other faiths accord with your values”. The Australian Christian Lobby is a registered charity, reporting income in the last financial year of close to $9m. The Australian Charities and Not-for-profit Commission has set up rules about what political work charities can undertake in the election. While charities can campaign on an issue, it must not be seen to be promoting or opposing a particular political party or candidate. Guardian Australia has seen several complaints sent to the ACNC about the flyers, however an ACNC spokesperson said the commission could not comment on specific charities, or whether concerns had been raised. The spokesperson said while charities can campaign, they must not cross the line into having a “disqualifying political purpose and that they maintain independence from party politics”. If an investigation is launched, the first step would be to bring the charity back into compliance, but where serious breaches have occurred and the ACNC’s concerns are not adequately addressed, the charity status can be revoked. Wendy Francis, the national director of the Australian Christian Lobby, told Guardian Australia: “We are aware of our ACNC obligations and we keep to them.” “There is no complaint from the ACNC, they’ve looked at the material. We’re not telling anybody how to vote, and we wouldn’t. We’re revealing how different members of parliament voted, it can work in their favour or against them.” The ACNC spokesperson said the regulator only publishes general guidance to charities and conveys this guidance via its contact centre. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The ACNC does not have a role in providing ‘approval’ to charities for the activities they choose to undertake.” Another Christian-based lobby group with charity status, FamilyVoice Australia, has also sent emails to supporters naming those MPs and saying their votes were “putting Australian Christians at risk of persecution, ridicule, and harassment at work, socially and in the public arena” and encouraged people to “vote wisely”. Guardian Australia has sought comment from FamilyVoice. On Tuesday, several of the Liberal MPs targeted defended their record against the attacks from the ACL. “As the son of a faith-based school principal I have a deep understanding of the role of faith-based schools,” Zimmerman said. “But I also have no regrets about standing up for gay students and teachers when I crossed the floor.” Archer said: “I stand by my decision to ensure Tasmania’s gold standard anti-discrimination laws remain intact.” “I have had further friendly and constructive discussions with Christian schools in northern Tasmania regarding my decision and I would welcome any discussion with the Australian Christian Lobby should they wish to reach out to me.” Sharma said: “The ACL attacks on me are misleading. I support the ability of faith-based schools to retain their faith-based character. “But what I do not support is the ability of faith-based schools to discriminate against teachers and students solely on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity, as Citipointe Christian College sought to do, for instance.” The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, this week withdrew promotional material for his re-election campaign featuring the head of charity Guide Dogs Victoria speaking in support of Frydenberg in the hotly-contested seat of Kooyong.",News/Australia news,Australian Christian Lobby faces complaints about flyers targeting MPs who opposed religious discrimination laws,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/23/australian-christian-lobby-faces-complaints-about-flyers-targeting-mps-who-opposed-religious-discrimination-laws
4/23/2022,"Bones hang along the fence at the entrance to a property in the bush on the southern outskirts of Ipswich, west of Brisbane. Made from papier-mache, the bones represent atrocities the site’s occupants believe were inflicted upon their Indigenous ancestors when it was part of the lands of the Deebing Creek Mission. Yet what lies inside the gate is a scene far from macabre. The first sight that greets visitors to 144 Grampian Drive is a grove of bananas, cassavas and rosellas, heavy with fruit and growing amid a tangle of sweet potatoes, pumpkins, leafy greens and herbs. The word “sovereignty” is emblazoned in large white letters upon an orange mesh fence which protects the plants from the chickens, turkeys and guinea fowl that roam between homes made of pallets, recycled timber and tarpaulins. If not the cluck of a chook, the first sound a visitor might hear is the laughter of children at play. Gamilaraay man Deekay says it is a sound that has “broken through the seriousness” that prevails at the camp he and his son, Thulu-Wii, have been occupying alongside other protesters since early 2019. “Laughter and joy is a big part of healing this place,” he says. Deekay and the others who occupy the site are fighting developer plans to turn this 30 hectare parcel of land into hundreds of new homes. On Thursday, the group were issued an ultimatum by developer AV Jennings. “Please remove yourself and your associates, the camp and possessions,” the letter read. Failure to do so would see AV Jennings charge Deekay and his companions with trespass, the letter warned. The developer has no plans to build upon the former mission itself, which was heritage-listed in recognition of the “great significance” it holds for the descendants of Aboriginal people brought here from as far afield as north Queensland and west as far as Charleville. Nor upon an Aboriginal cemetery, recognised only thanks to the campaigns of Indigenous people of the 1970s, led by Uncle Les Davidson. It is the surrounding culturally sensitive bushland that the occupants of the Deebing Creek camp are fighting to protect, as they believe it harbours the unmarked remains of ancestors. Frasers Property acquired more than 110 hectares of the former Aboriginal reserve in 2015 and four years later AV Jennings signed a cultural heritage management plan to develop an adjoining lot with Aboriginal corporation the Yuggera Ugarapul People, who were contacted for comment for this article. It is not a document recognised by the occupants of the Deebing Creek camp. Yuggera man Daniel Thompson says Native Title and Indigenous land use agreements have had a poisonous effect on First Nations communities. “They have turned us on each other,” Thompson says. The struggle at Deebing Creek is not only over land, but facts. Carla Davidson-Fewquandie, a Yuggera and Kullili traditional owner of Deebing Creek, says people raised by those who lived at the mission passed on the story of Julia Ford, a teacher who tried to defend a group of more than 50 children from the rifle. The teacher and children were massacred, the oral history goes, their bodies dumped in a pit. This horrific account is not acknowledged in Deebing Creek’s officially recognised history. “We just want to conserve this site and make sure that the right thing is done and the history is being told,” Davidson-Fewquandie says. “The right history.” Ford’s headstone has been found and forms part of the Aboriginal cemetery, her death recorded as 1896. But those occupying the Deebing Creek camp do not believe the headstone marks the teacher’s real grave. Instead, they believe her remains lie in a long rectangular depression beside it, alongside those of the children she tried to save. So, over recent years, Yuggera Ugarapul traditional owners commissioned archaeologist Wayne Brennan to conduct ground-penetrating radar analysis in search of unmarked graves. Brennan’s report found underground “anomalies” on the site at which Ford and the children are said to be buried, determining these “could be due to an excavation taking place and then subsequently refilled”. At the same time, Prof David Lambert from Griffith University’s ancient DNA laboratory has been studying human remains found on the former mission. “Oral history always said there was a pit and there was a massacre,” Thompson says. “Well this shows there was a pit and there was bones.” AV Jennings has previously said it was “deeply disappointed to be accused of being disrespectful” to traditional owners, “particularly when it is based on erroneous information”. “It is a matter of fact that our Deebing Heights site does not include any part of the former Mission cemetery,” a 2019 statement quoting its national development manager, Angus Johnson, read. The developer says its archaeologists have held extensive discussions with traditional owners and “there are no records or historical reports of a massacre at Deebing Creek”. “There is no oral or written history of a massacre at Deebing Creek,” it says. AV Jennings also says there is no evidence of burials within lands on its Deebing Springs site and that its extensive surveys involving dozens of excavated test pits “yielded over 700 stone artefacts” but no human remains. Off the grid, surrounded by eucalypt and tea tree scrub, the dozen to 20 or so people occupying the site at any one time walk lightly upon land they believe harbours the unmarked remains of Yuggera, Gomeroi, Kamilaroi, Darumbal and other First Nations people who were brought here, often forcibly, between the years of 1892 to 1915. Their way of life could not be more starkly contrasted to the scene directly across the road. On the other side of Grampian Drive is a new housing estate – one of many which continue to pop up in this fast growing corridor of south-east Queensland. Deebing Springs, as this part of the former Aboriginal reserve has been rebranded by AV Jennings, forms part of the Ripley Valley priority development area, proclaimed by the Queensland government as “one of the largest urban growth areas in Australia”. When its development scheme was published in 2011, the 4,680 hectare Ripley Valley was home to 400 people living on rural landholdings. The scheme aims to develop up to 50,000 homes for 120,000 people. Among the infrastructure and facilities that the government argues make this valley ripe for development are nearby highways, a Tafe and university campuses. Thulu-Wii, and the other children who occupy Deebing Creek, are bush schooled. The camp has no electricity nor running water. An open fire flickering near a communal kitchen was lit in early 2021 when it was sparked using embers from the sacred fire at the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in Canberra. Like their forebears around the turn of the 20th century, people at Deebing Creek today have been drawn from far and wide. Gunggari and Wakka Wakka woman Kris Bunda was called to Deebing Creek 18 months ago in two consecutive dreams by her dead grandmother. Known as Yowie, “’cause that’s who I work for”, Bunda lives in a caravan with her two girls. Yowie has been declared chief protector of the bones and cemetery, guarding an area believed to harbour the unmarked remains of other mass killings. This place is an eroded network of sandy waterways, lined with the critically endangered swamp tea tree, known as “the pit”. Yowie runs truth and healing ceremonies for anyone willing to participate. “A lot of people are afraid to come through those gates,” she says. “But when you do it’s like [a] boomerang, you keep coming back.” Garden working bees are another way by which the general public is invited to join Deebing Creek’s occupation. Deekay says food production is proving a means to “decolonising our diet” and continues the legacy of Aboriginal people who have carved out a home here since European arrival. The renegade gardeners are aware of the irony that many of the staple foods they produce are not native, but celebrate those that are. The crisp and sweet native winter apples growing throughout the gardens have become an emblem of the camp. Gumbi gumbi are used to treat rashes and other ailments and illnesses. Davidson plums grow. While they tend to this patch of cleared land, the traditional owners at Deebing Creek say they are learning more of their pre-colonial heritage in the surrounding bush. Thompson talks of scar trees with canoe-shaped markings in their bark and groove marks in the sandstone of Deebing Creek where tools were sharpened and flour ground. The people at Deebing Creek dream of creating a future here, but Thompson says it is the past that keeps him fighting. “They are trying to say the atrocities that they’ve done to our people on this site haven’t happened,” he says. “The only reason why we are drawn back here is because we know our dead are here and we have to protect them.” And the living have no plans of abandoning the dead lightly. “I got the call from spirit to come here,” Yowie says. “And so you take me outta here in handcuffs or a coffin, ’cause I just don’t go.”",News/Australia news,Deebing Creek: Aboriginal protesters near former mission threatened with eviction as development looms,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/23/deebing-creek-aboriginal-protesters-near-former-mission-threatened-with-eviction-as-development-looms
4/23/2022,"The story of King Cnut the Great (Canute to you) is often misunderstood. The early 11th-century ruler of the North Sea empire was not an arrogant fool who sought to stem the rising tide, proving man’s dominion over all. Placing his throne on the bank of a river he thundered, “I order you not to rise on to my land, nor to wet the clothes or body of your Lord.” As the water reached his shins, he declared to his courtiers: “Let all the world know that the power of kings is empty and worthless … heaven, earth and sea obey eternal laws.” Or, as uttered by The Master in Doctor Who in 1976, “resistance is futile”. In the face of climate change and sea-level rise, it’s a lesson that’s been forgotten by our politicians as they scramble to defend human-made assets from the ravages of waves turbo-charged by weather systems. On Collaroy-Narrabeen beach, the Northern Beaches council is building a towering concrete vertical seawall – 7.5 metres high and piered 10 metres below the sand – to defend private property from the inevitable. Not only is it arguably the ugliest edifice ever built on the Australian coast, but when vertical walls are built on narrow beaches they reflect and concentrate wave energy, accelerating erosion rather than ameliorating it. This section of beach is now facing extinction. As coastal engineer, Angus Gordon, told me: “It’s a 19th-century response to a 21st-century problem. A step back in time to the non-environmental brutalist engineering solutions of the 1900s.” Gordon, who has been recognised by the United Nations as an international expert on coastal zone management, has been involved with projects worldwide. And, as a former manager of Pittwater council (now amalgamated with Northern Beaches), he knows the problem of beach erosion first-hand. He was one of the architects of the 2016 NSW Coastal Management Act, which suffered a long, agonising birth into law, only to see it scuppered by a risk-averse state government intent on “cost-shifting”. “The state just washed their hands of it. Too hard,” Gordon says. “The NSW government just wanted to get noisy beachfront property owners off its back.” The application of the act was dumped on to local councils. Coastal management in NSW has now descended to a mish-mash of ad hoc solutions from local councils who lack the expertise, management and oversight of what’s being built on the coast as the tides roll in. Too often at the expense of beach amenity – those beautiful, adored stretches of sand and surf which belong to all of us, not just a wealthy few. “We don’t even have a coherent coastal vulnerability map to refer to so we know which properties are at risk, let alone a way of administering what’s being done up and down the coast,” Gordon laments. In the past (under the previous 1979 Act), a development like the Collaroy seawall would have come before an independent state government Coastal Panel. In fact, a seawall of almost the same vertical design now being built on Collaroy-Narrabeen beach was panned by that (now abolished) expert panel. “What we need is an independent, non-political commissioner to oversee management of our coast. There must be an equitable balance of solutions between private landowners and the larger community of beach users,” Gordon says. Those solutions include rock revetment walls, sand nourishment and strategic buyback of threatened properties. In 2019 the NSW government appointed an independent building commissioner after a series of catastrophic failures in that sector. “We urgently need the same for the coast,” says Gordon. “I’d back the growing call for an inquiry to the decisions which have led to the manifestation of the Collaroy-Narrabeen seawall.” The urgent need for a “hands-off” approach is backed by University of Sydney coastal geomorphologist Prof Andrew Short, who has been studying Collaroy-Narrabeen beach since 1976. “What we have now with this seawall is a total disaster,” Short says. “The only people who benefit are the private landowners.” For its own part, the Northern Beaches council approved the building of the seawall after amalgamating a number of development applications from beachfront property owners – the same DA as you might use to build a carport. The resulting DA only attracted mere handful of written submissions. Despite decades of community activism to protect the beach, so many were blindsided by the development. Where was the community forum? The input from surfers, beach lovers and residents in the wider community. We must have missed it. The council is now pushing to extend the seawall further north along the beach. Many locals are calling for a moratorium until the Northern Beaches council has taken independent, expert advice and declared its reasoning and intentions beyond a few private landowners. When the preservation of a precious beach for future generations is at stake, we all should have a say. The ancient king had it right. When it comes to protecting our beaches, old Cnuts often know best.",News/Australia news,"As Australia battles wild weather and coastal erosion, we should learn from our mistakes  | Wendy Harmer",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/23/as-australia-battles-wild-weather-and-coastal-erosion-we-should-learn-from-our-mistakes
4/23/2022,"The marshals of Imola most deservedly earned a warming glass of vino rosso as darkness fell after qualifying for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, such was the frequency of the demands on them to wave red flags during a torturously slow, rain-afflicted session. By its close Red Bull’s Max Verstappen had earned “pole position” but such is the equally painful structuring of this format, while his pole counts statistically in the record books it is only for Saturday’s sprint race which will decide the literal pole for Sunday’s GP. Verstappen beat Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc into second and McLaren’s Lando Norris into third. But for Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes the rain, the flags, the wretched format paled into insignificance next to the excruciating discomfort of his team’s performance at Imola as they fell to their worst showing in almost a decade. Hamilton only narrowly made it into Q2 and finished in 13th place with his teammate George Russell in 11th. They were unlucky in that the rain prevented them setting better times in Q2 but they were clearly already struggling, their car suffering with a severe form of the porpoising that has afflicted them all season. It is the first time a Mercedes has not made it into Q3 since the Japanese GP in 2012. Hamilton was seen in a lively discussion with team principal Toto Wolff at the back of the Mercedes garage afterwards and perhaps in a sign of his frustration was unusually critical in his assessment. “It wasn’t a great session, naturally it’s disappointing,” he said. “We underperformed as a team today. There are things that we should have done that we didn’t do. We will just keep working hard, but each weekend is a rescue.” He pointedly also declined to explain the subject of his conversation with Wolff. “It was all internal stuff,” Hamilton added. “I do not want to share what was said.” At the sharp end Mercedes once ruled with an iron fist, it was swiftly clear qualifying would be decided by the two title protagonists Verstappen and Leclerc. It had opened on a damp but drying track at the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari but heavy rain returned midway through to make for tricky conditions at the business end of the session, which was interrupted by five red-flag stoppages. Leclerc set the pace on his opening hot lap in Q3, mighty through the second and third sectors but he was only two-hundredths clear of Verstappen with a time of 1min 28.778sec. The drivers kept lapping as the clock ticked down and Verstappen pipped his rival with a 1min 27.999sec lap just before another red flag as Valtteri Bottas ground to a halt on track. The pair might have vied once more on a final hot run with three minutes remaining but as the rain became heavier the session was brought to a suitably anticlimactic finale, put out of its misery with another red flag as Norris too went off. “It was a hectic, long qualifying,” said Verstappen, who was nonetheless pleased F1 was racing at Imola. “We’re very happy to be here. It’s an amazing track. It really punishes you if you make a mistake you can go in the wall. That’s what we like to make it really hard and difficult.” The serious business remains however. Saturday’s 21-lap sprint race will not only decide the grid for Sunday’s race but world championship points will also be awarded to the top eight finishers on a scale from eight to one. Securing the win now has genuine weight. Pole gives Verstappen the chance to claw back points in the title fight which Leclerc leads on 71, with the world champion, who has retired twice this season, in sixth on 25. The sprint race was trialled last year and the format has been tweaked but the most significant issue around it remains unsatisfactory. This year F1 have decided that for statistical purposes the quickest driver on Friday will be deemed to have taken pole position but the sprint race will still decide the grid for Sunday’s grand prix. At which point a driver will be on pole, yet not acknowledged to have taken pole. F1’s byzantine, semantic war on the senses deems that said driver will be referred to as having taken “P1”. A confusing muddle likely to satisfy neither drivers nor fans. Leclerc’s teammate Carlos Sainz was an early casualty, caught out in Q2, going too hard and losing the rear at the second Rivazza corner, he finished in 10th. Kevin Magnussen was in an excellent fourth for Haas, Fernando Alonso in fifth for Alpine and Daniel Ricciardo in sixth for McLaren. Red Bull’s Sergio Pérez was in seventh, Bottas in eighth for Alfa Romeo and Sebastian Vettel in ninth for Aston Martin. Mick Schumacher was 12th for Haas, Guanyu Zhou in 14th for Alfa Romeo and Lance Stroll 15th for Aston Martin. Alex Albon retired from Q1 after a brake disc caught fire and exploded on his Williams and he will start from the back of the grid. His teammate Nicholas Latifi was in 18th. Yuki Tsunoda and Pierre Gasly were in 16th and 17th for AlphaTauri, with Alpine’s Esteban Ocon in 19th.",Sport/Sport,Max Verstappen beats rain and Leclerc to take F1 Imola GP sprint race pole,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/22/max-verstappen-beats-rain-and-leclerc-to-take-f1-imola-gp-sprint-race-pole
4/23/2022,"For Joe Biden, the vote by Florida Republicans on Thursday to strip Disney of its self-governing powers was a step too far. “Christ, they’re going after Mickey Mouse,” the president exclaimed at a fundraiser in Oregon, in apparent disbelief that state governor Ron DeSantis’s culture wars had reached the gates of the Magic Kingdom. The move, Biden asserted, reflected his belief that the “far right has taken over the party”. By voting to penalize Florida’s largest private employer, lawmakers followed DeSantis’s wishes in securing revenge on a company he brands as “woke” for its opposition to his “don’t say gay” law. DeSantis is a likely candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024. He has pushed his legislature on several rightwing laws in recent weeks, including a 15-week abortion ban, stripping Black voters of congressional representation and preventing discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity issues in schools. On Friday, the governor signed the anti-Disney law as well as a measure banning critical race theory in schools and the controversial new electoral map. Voting rights groups including the League of Women Voters of Florida, the Black Voters Matter Capacity Building Institute and the Equal Ground Education Fund filed suit against the new electoral map, in state court in Tallahassee. “This is not your father’s Republican party,” Biden said at the fundraiser in Oregon. “It’s not even conservative in a traditional sense of conservatism. It’s mean, it’s ugly. Look at what’s happening in Florida: Christ, they’re going after Mickey Mouse.” Analysts are still grappling with the likely effects of the Disney law, which will disband an entity officially known as the Reedy Creek improvement district. The body, which was approved by Florida legislators in 1967, gives Disney autonomous powers, including generating its own tax revenue and self-governance as it built its hugely popular theme parks. Ending the 55-year agreement, Democrats says, will leave local residents on the hook for the functions Reedy Creek was responsible for paying for, including police and fire services, and road construction and maintenance. The state senator Gary Farmer, a vocal opponent of DeSantis, said families in Orange and Osceola counties that straddle the 25,000-acre Disney World resort could each face property tax raises of $2,200 annually to cover the shortfall. His claim is so far unsubstantiated. Republicans have been unable to point to any financial advantage to the state, and appear to be relying instead on the political argument that the concept of the “special taxing district” was outdated and in need of reform. “Aside from maybe taking away the company’s ability to build a nuclear plant, we have yet to hear how this benefits Florida, and especially the local residents in any way,” Nick Papantonis, a reporter who covers Disney for Orlando’s WFTV, said in a Twitter analysis. “The residents, by the way, had no say in this vote, no say in their property taxes going through the roof, and no desire to have their communities staring at financial ruin.” If in practice DeSantis’s goal is to punish Disney, some say the move could backfire, at least financially. Reedy Creek’s abolition on 1 June next year would give it an immediate tax break. The $163m it taxes itself annually to pay for service and pay off debt becomes the responsibility of the county taxpayers. “The moment that Reedy Creek doesn’t exist is the moment that those taxes don’t exist,” the Orange county tax collector Scott Randolph, a Democrat, told WFTV. “[And] Orange county can’t just slap a new taxing district on to that area and recoup the money that was lost.” Most of Disney’s estimated 77,000 cast members, as its workers are known, live in those two counties, so would effectively end up paying their employer’s taxes as well as their own, critics say. Disney has remained silent, its most recent comment on the entire affair being the hard-hitting statement that upset DeSantis in the first place. The company, which has a notably diverse cast, promised to work to overturn the “don’t say gay” law, and added it was halting all political donations. Disney contributed almost $1m to the Republican party of Florida in 2020, and $50,000 directly to DeSantis, records show. Whatever it decides to do, Disney has options. In a probably tongue-in-cheek offer, the Colorado governor, Jared Polis, is offering “asylum” to Mickey Mouse in his state. But he was critical of DeSantis’s stance. “Florida’s authoritarian socialist attacks on the private sector are driving businesses away.

Legal challenges are expected once DeSantis signs the Reedy Creek abolition into law, and Republicans point out they could revisit the issue next year before it takes effect. Democrats are dismissive: “Let’s call this what it is, it’s the punitive, petulant political payback to a corporation who dared to say the emperor has no clothes, but if they behave this way next election cycle, maybe we’ll put it back together,” Farmer, the state senator, said. Some political analysts, meanwhile, believe DeSantis is walking a tightrope. “The base is demanding of the Republican party these culture war elements, at least that’s what these politicians are thinking, so they’re using these attacks on ‘woke’ corporations as a way of energizing their base so they can win in 2022 and 2024,” Charles Zelden, professor of humanities and politics at Nova Southeastern University and a longtime Florida Disney watcher, told the Guardian. “The downside is it’s bringing them into conflict with corporations they had a very comfortable relationship with for a lot of years, who have donated a lot of money to their campaigns.”",News/US news,Biden: Republicans’ Disney law shows ‘far right has taken over party’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/22/biden-desantis-florida-republicans-disney
4/23/2022,"A senior Russian military commander has said the goal of Russia’s new offensive is to seize control of southern Ukraine and form a land bridge to Crimea, indicating that Russia plans a permanent occupation of Ukrainian territory taken in the war. Rustam Minnekayev, acting commander of the central military district, also told members of a defence industry forum on Friday that control over southern Ukraine would give Russia access to Transnistria, a pro-Russian breakaway region of Moldova, indicating that Russia may attack the port city of Odesa or launch an economic blockade of the area. The remarks directly contradict earlier claims from Vladimir Putin that Russia was not planning to occupy Ukrainian cities permanently and suggests the Kremlin is changing tack after its failed offensive toward Kyiv, which appeared to seek regime change. The statement was the first by a high-ranking official about the Russian military’s goals to occupy territory as it manoeuvres for an anticipated “battle for Donbas” in Ukraine’s east. “Since the beginning of the second phase of the special operation … one of the tasks of the Russian army is to establish full control over Donbas and southern Ukraine. This will provide a land corridor to Crimea, as well as affecting vital objects of the Ukrainian economy, Black Sea ports through which agricultural and metallurgical products are supplied to [other] countries,” Minnekayev said on Friday at the annual meeting of the Union of Defence Industry Enterprises of Russia’s Sverdlovsk region. Crimea was annexed by Russia in 2014, a move not recognised by the international community. Russia’s campaign in southern Ukraine has been more successful than its attempts to take Kyiv from the north, although it has also met fierce resistance from Ukrainian troops. Russia has occupied the city of Kherson and has claimed near-total control of Mariupol, as it plans a pincer-style attack on Ukrainian forces in the eastern Donbas region. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused Russia of planning to “falsify” an independence referendum in the partly occupied southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, telling Ukrainians there not to give personal information to occupying forces. Russia was planning “to falsify a so-called referendum on your land, if an order comes from Moscow to stage such a show. And this is the reality. Be careful,” Zelenskiy said. The Kremlin refused to answer questions about Minnekayev’s comments on Friday, saying the Russian defence ministry was responsible for the “special operation”, meaning Russia’s war in Ukraine. It is not clear if Minnekayev was revealing details about Russia’s formal plans for its offensive or expressing his personal views on the benefits of Russia’s military offensive. Minnekayev, the acting commander of one of Russia’s four military districts, also said that “control over southern Ukraine will give yet another point of access to Transnistria, where facts of oppression of the Russian-speaking population have also been observed”. “Apparently, we are now at war with the whole world,” Minnekayev said. If true, that could indicate Russia would seek to take Odesa, one of Ukraine’s largest cities, and seek to reinforce its positions in Transnistria, a Russian-controlled territory of Moldova that has hosted Russian troops since the fall of the Soviet Union. With Russian backing, Transnistria fought a war against Moldova in the 1990s that left the territory with de facto independence and a garrison of 1,500 Russian troops. The region is recognised as part of Moldova. The unrecognised state is strongly influenced internationally by nostalgia for the Soviet Union and its affinity for Russia, which is fostered by state propaganda. It is unlikely that Russian forces, which have sustained considerable losses in the early stages of the war, would be able to stage an offensive toward Odesa at the moment, much less the border with Moldova. Russian warships have been driven further from Ukraine’s coast after the Moskva cruiser, a Russian flagship, sank in the Black Sea last week. Ukraine claimed it had attacked the cruiser with anti-ship missiles. On Friday night the Russian defence ministry said one sailor had died and 27 were missing after the Moskva fire, with 396 others rescued. Analysts said that Minnekayev’s statement could mean Russia would target the economy of Odesa and the surrounding region rather than launch an attack on the city. Russian forces had already been driven back in a Ukrainian counteroffensive last month and may be close to exhaustion. “My interpretation of the recent statement by Minnekayev is that Russia intends to hold on to what they’ve taken in the south (largely assumed at this point), and try to pressure Ukraine over time on the economic front, including via blockade,” Michael Kofman, research program director in the Russia studies programme at CNA, a research and analysis organisation based in Arlington, Virginia, wrote on Twitter. “I am sceptical of any further major offensives beyond Donbas given losses and current force availability constraints,” he added.",News/World news,Russian commander suggests plan is for permanent occupation of south Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/22/ukraine-south-occupation-russian-military-chief-rustam-minnekayev
4/23/2022,"New audio clips reveal that the House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, held Donald Trump responsible in the immediate aftermath of the January 6 Capitol riot, and that Trump himself accepted “some responsibility” for the insurrection. The explosive clips were released by the New York Times on Thursday and Friday after an earlier report said McCarthy and the Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, initially believed Trump to be responsible for the attack, and both privately expressed anger against him. Speaking in Seattle on Friday, Joe Biden addressed the reports. “This ain’t your father’s Republican party,” the president said. “All you got to do is look what’s being played out this morning, the tape that was released … “This is the Maga [Make America Great Again] party now … these guys are a different breed of cat. They’re not like those I served with [in the US Senate] for so many years, and the people who know better are afraid to act better because they know they’ll be primaried. “They come to me and say: ‘Joe, I want to be with you on such and such but I can’t because I’ll be primaried, I’ll lose my race.’ Folks, this has got to start to change.” In one released clip, from a 10 January 2021 call with House GOP leaders, McCarthy can be heard answering a question from the Wyoming representative Liz Cheney, who had a leadership role at the time. Cheney asked McCarthy if he believed Trump would resign if Congress passed a 25th amendment resolution, which would declare Trump incapable of holding office. “My gut tells me no. I am seriously thinking about having that conversation with him tonight,” he said. “The only discussion I would have with him is I think [the resolution] will pass, and it would be my recommendation that he should resign. “That would be my take, but I don’t think he would take it. But I don’t know.” In a second clip from 11 January, McCarthy can be heard detailing a conversation with Trump where he asked the former president if he believed he had any responsibility for the attack. McCarthy says: “Well, let me be very clear to all of you, and I’ve been very clear to the president: he bears responsibility for his words and actions. No ifs, ands or buts. I asked him personally today, ‘Does he hold responsibility for what happened? Does he feel bad about what happened?’ He told me he does have some responsibility for what happened and he needs to acknowledge that.” McCarthy did not immediately respond to the release of the audio clips. Nor did Trump, though the Washington Post reported that the two men had spoken. Trump, the paper said, was “not upset about McCarthy’s remarks and … glad the Republican leader didn’t follow through” on his threat to demand Trump’s resignation, “which Trump saw as a sign of his continued grip on the Republican party”. A spokesperson for Cheney said she did not release the tape and did not know who leaked it. In a statement on Thursday, before the clip was released, McCarthy made a blanket denial of the Times report saying that it is “totally false and wrong”. “It comes as no surprise that the corporate media is obsessed with doing everything it can to further the liberal agenda,” he said. “The corporate media is more concerned with profiting from manufactured political intrigue from politically-motivated sources. “Our country has suffered enough under failed one-party Democrat rule, and no amount of media ignorance and bias will stop Americans from delivering a clear message this fall that it is time for change.” The Times story, reporting for which comes from an upcoming book. This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden and the Battle for America’s Future, by Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns, detailed scathing comments against Trump Republican leaders made in the days after the Capitol insurrection. McCarthy reportedly told colleagues in private: “I’ve had it with this guy,” adding: “What he did is unacceptable. Nobody can defend it and nobody should defend it.” McConnell reportedly told senior advisers: “If this isn’t impeachable, I don’t know what is. “The Democrats are going to take care of the son of a bitch for us,” McConnell said, according to the book. Although McConnell criticized Trump publicly for his role in the attack, he voted to acquit the former president in his impeachment trial. He also said he would support Trump should Trump be the 2024 Republican nominee. McCarthy, for his part, did a more complete about-face: he has claimed Trump was unaware of the attack until McCarthy told him it was happening. McCarthy has also condemned the special House panel that is investigating the insurrection and refused to cooperate with its inquiry on conversations he had with Trump after the attack.",News/US news,"Trump accepted ‘some responsibility’ for Capitol attack, McCarthy audio reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/22/kevin-mccarthy-trump-recording-house-republican-capitol-attack
4/23/2022,"Boris Johnson has said he will close loopholes to ensure UK exports to India cannot end up being used in Russian weapons, as he conceded the war in Ukraine could go on until the end of next year, and Russia could win. Speaking in Delhi at the end of a two-day visit, the UK prime minister warned that Vladimir Putin was resorting to a “grinding approach” in Ukraine; and suggested the UK would help to “backfill” countries including Poland if they provided heavy weaponry such as tanks to Kyiv. Johnson was asked a report by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), warning that India was one of a number of major routes for smuggling arms to Vladimir Putin’s regime. He pointed to the ban on exporting technology products to Russia, saying: “We want to ensure we keep that tight. We’ll be making sure that we don’t allow any loopholes of any kind … we will take steps to make sure that stuff doesn’t go through other routes to Russia.” Hours before the Rusi analysis was published, the government announced it would ease arms exporting licensing arrangements with New Delhi by issuing an open general export licence to India, hailing closer defence cooperation as one of the wins from the prime minister’s two-day trip. The report from Rusi, a 26-page overview of Russia’s military situation, says western economic sanctions mean Moscow will become increasingly reliant on component-smuggling to ensure its jets, missiles and other hi-tech munitions can function. Some components have a dual civilian and military use. Its authors, Jack Watling and Nick Reynolds, warn that “Russia has established mechanisms for laundering these items through third countries”, and they argue that India should be subject to specific restrictions. “Restricting access, therefore, likely means preventing export to countries such as India of goods that are in some instances used for civilian purposes,” the two write. They add: “Moreover, there are myriad companies based around the world, including in the Czech Republic, Serbia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Turkey, India and China who will take considerable risks to meet Russia supply requirements.” Labour’s shadow defence secretary, John Healey, accused Johnson of going on “a vanity trip”, and urged him to do more to press India to clamp down on exports that could be used in defence. “Boris Johnson’s vanity trip to India was designed to distract from his law-breaking and failure to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. But he can use this report to help halt the Russian war in Ukraine. He must press for urgent action from prime minister Modi to clamp down on weapons parts passing through India and into Russian hands,” he said. Asked about briefings from western intelligence figures suggesting the Ukraine conflict could go on for many more months, and may result in a Russian victory, Johnson said: “The sad thing is that that is a realistic possibility. “Of course, Putin has a huge army. He has a very difficult political position because he’s made a catastrophic blunder, so that the only option he now has really is to try to use his appalling, grinding approach, led by artillery, trying to grind the Ukrainians down.” Johnson said Putin was close to securing Mariupol – but he paid tribute to the resistance of Ukrainians: “No matter what military superiority Vladimir Putin may be able to bring to bear in the next few months – and I agree it could be a long period – he will not be able to conquer the spirit of the Ukrainian people.” He announced that the UK would reopen its embassy in Kyiv next week, and suggested more ministers could follow his lead and visit the Ukrainian capital in the coming weeks. And he suggested the UK could send weaponry to neighbouring countries who could provide Ukraine with arms. “We are looking at sending to tanks to Poland to try to help them as they send some of their T72s [tanks] to Ukraine,” he said. An MOD spokesperson clarified the remarks on Friday evening, saying: “As announced by the prime minister, the UK is currently exploring sending British Challenger 2 tanks to Poland. While no decisions have been taken, these would be deployed on a short-term basis and operated by UK service personnel to bridge the gap between Poland donating tanks to Ukraine, and replacements arriving.” Johnson discussed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with Modi when the pair held bilateral talks on Friday morning. India’s foreign secretary, Harsh Vardhan Shringla, told reporters Johnson put “no pressure” on Modi over the issue. Delivering a statement alongside Johnson on Friday, Modi called for an “immediate ceasefire” in Ukraine, and emphasised the importance of diplomacy, but did not criticise Russia, which is India’s biggest supplier of arms. India has abstained from successive United Nations motions condemning Russia, and continues to buy Moscow’s oil. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, met Modi in Delhi this month, and insisted the two countries would continue to find ways to trade, despite western sanctions on Russia.",News/Politics,Johnson vows to stop UK exports to India ending up in Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/22/johnson-vows-to-stop-uk-exports-to-india-ending-up-in-russia
4/23/2022,"It was the hottest day of the year, the sun was shining with the temperature in the mid-20s, perfect for a get together – or so one of Boris Johnson’s top officials had obviously thought. In an email, sent to more than 100 employees, on 20 May 2020, Martin Reynolds, the prime minister’s principal private secretary, wrote: “Hi all, after what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening. Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze!” There was just one problem – the country was in lockdown. The gathering, believed to have been attended by 30 or 40 people, occurred at a time when social mixing was banned except with one other person from another household outdoors in a public place. Staff quaffed wine and ate food laid out for them on tables. Among those present was the prime minister, who is believed to have attended with his then fiancee – now wife – Carrie Johnson. When details of the gathering first emerged, Johnson said he joined the event for about 25 minutes from 6pm to talk to and thank staff, believing that it was a work event, with the No 10 garden being used as “an extension of the office” amid lockdown. It was an explanation that attracted howls of derision in the House of Commons, given the invitation to “bring your own booze”. While the prime minister said he was not warned it was against the rules – and Reynolds was apparently equally ignorant, assuming it was not a wilful breach – some staff were more cautious. They feared they might be breaking the very laws the government had implemented. “Um. Why is Martin encouraging a mass gathering in the garden?” one staffer said, according to the BBC. Another asked: “Is this for real?”  Johnson’s former aide Dominic Cummings, also claimed he raised a red flag at the time, saying he had told Reynolds that the invitation broke the rules. He said the prime minister’s principal private secretary replied: “So long as it’s socially distanced I think it’s OK, I’ll check with the PM if he’s happy for it to go ahead.” Just minutes before the party started, the daily press conference held inside Downing Street had concluded. The then culture secretary, now Conservative party co-chair, Oliver Dowden, had reinforced the messaging around what was permitted, saying: “You can meet one person outside your household in an outdoor, public place provided that you stay 2 metres apart.” Dowden announced the launch of the Covid alert level system, with each of its five levels relating to the level of threat posed by the virus, with the country at the time preparing to move to level 3 from 4. On that day, there were 9,953 people in hospital with coronavirus. A further 363 deaths were announced, bringing the total at that point to 35,704. Dowden was not the only one highlighting the rules. The Metropolitan police told people in a tweet on the afternoon of 20 May 2020 that they could have a picnic, exercise or do sport outside providing you are “on your own, with people you live with, or just you and one other person”.

4/23/2022,"“Big place, this,” Sir Alex Ferguson would say as he gazed around Old Trafford in the early days, a sense of awe in those gruff tones. Big job, too. When Ferguson took over from Ron Atkinson as the Manchester United manager in November 1986, the club were fourth from bottom of the old First Division and the culture was all wrong, especially in the playing squad, where there was too much boozing and not enough achieving. There will doubtless be a moment when the scale of it all hits Erik ten Hag, who was confirmed on Thursday as United’s next permanent manager; he will begin work over the summer, once he has finished the season at Ajax. Because not since Ferguson has an incoming manager found the club at such a low ebb. It is not about the league position. David Moyes inherited a champion team from Ferguson in 2013, albeit one that had surely peaked, but Louis van Gaal and José Mourinho took over with the club having finished the previous season in seventh and fifth respectively, and Ole Gunnar Solskjær – initially the caretaker – got them when they were sixth. United are sixth again under another interim, Ralf Rangnick, although the statistics show that they have their lowest points tally of the Premier League era after 33 matches. What sets the situation apart are the feelings of helplessness and frustration in the stands and dressing room, which are not helped by a glance at their greatest rivals. When Ferguson took over his biggest challenge was to knock Liverpool off their perch but they are now back on it and, even worse, Manchester City are up alongside them. The coming weeks will once again see the United fanbase wrestle with a dilemma. Of two unpalatable options, who would they rather win the league and, even, the Champions League? (It is probably still City in a photo-finish.) The fans have protested vociferously against the Glazer family ownership over the past week or so but what has been more worrying of late has been how some of them have turned on certain players at Old Trafford. Harry Maguire was cheered ironically when substituted against Atlético Madrid and Paul Pogba told where to go when he came off against Norwich. Even Marcus Rashford, the local hero and national treasure, has heard exasperated cries. This is extremely unusual at United, where – amid a dismal run of form and some abject performances – Rangnick has detected a fear factor. “We didn’t dare to attack,” he said after the 4-0 loss at Liverpool on Tuesday night, referring mainly to the first half. “It almost looked that they were afraid to be outplayed.” Rangnick is so concerned by the club’s injury list that he wants an investigation into why it has been so long but the very worst thing – the bottom line – is the lack of identity, the sense of square pegs in round holes, a jarring friction. Under Solskjær, United at least played in a particular way: a quick, counterattacking style that would yield some thrills, especially when allied to a never-say-die attitude, even if its lack of depth ultimately saw him exposed. It has been different under Rangnick. He wants intensity, hard running without the ball, to use the counterpress as a tool to attack and defend, and he has not found the players to execute it. The result has been an absence of control, creative toils and opponents running through United. Apart from David de Gea, has any player performed to or above his level? Maybe Fred. Cristiano Ronaldo’s numbers have been decent but do not tell the whole story. It has led to the view that this is the worst Old Trafford team since the late 1980s. Even De Gea’s excellence carries a caveat: United’s best player ought not to be their goalkeeper. Ten Hag represents the reboot, a very good coach who knows what he wants and how to implement it. It is pass-and-move football, with effective pressing – a little like the vision of Rangnick. Although wedded to a classic 4-3-3 at Ajax – it is in the constitution there – Ten Hag is flexible and, above all, he wants to win. The optimistic reading is that Ten Hag, who believes he can get so much more out of the squad, can take gradual and sure-footed steps forward, putting a playing structure in place, an identity, with signings aligned to his needs in the short and longer term. With United’s appeal and financial power, it should be possible to turn things back in the right direction – if decisions are sound and consistent. The rebuild in the summer stands to be huge, Rangnick – who will move into a consultancy role – saying during the week that “there will be … I don’t know … six, seven, eight, maybe 10 new players”. Pogba, Nemanja Matic, Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata and Edinson Cavani are expected or set to leave as free agents and Dean Henderson will surely prioritise greater playing time elsewhere. There have to be doubts over the futures of Phil Jones, Eric Bailly and Anthony Martial, who is on loan at Sevilla. The negative reading is that the body of work is simply too great, Liverpool and City too far ahead, and Ten Hag will fall foul of the equation which sets progress against time and pressure. Nor will it only be about the technical stuff because this is United, this is politics, international relations, box office. Is Ten Hag ready to be the de facto club spokesman on pretty much everything, the one voice heard with any regularity? It requires a force of personality to drive the juggernaut and a will to do so, which does not depend entirely on a fluency in English, even if that helps. The right kind of noises or content are key and, at Ajax Ten Hag has not always given the impression that he is comfortable in front of the media. The Dutch sometimes refer to him as wereldvreemd or world strange, someone so focused on football that he does not know anything else. Ten Hag will need the support of everybody at United, particularly the staff in the recruitment department, and one thing is clear: he has it all to prove. Big place, this. Big job.",Sport/Football,"Helplessness, frustration and fear: the picture of modern Manchester United | David Hytner",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/22/manchester-united-helplessness-frustration-fear-erik-ten-hag-worst-team-late-1980s
4/23/2022,"Chernihiv is the largest Ukrainian city to have been freed from Russian occupation. Its pre-war population was estimated at around 280,000. After being under siege for more than a month only a third of that figure remains. Seven hundred people have lost their lives, according to official sources. Before the Russian invasion on 24 February, the city was little known around the world. It is situated 150 kilometres northeast of Kyiv and just 60km away from the border with Belarus, on the banks of the Desna river. In Ukraine, Chernihiv was known for its wonderful churches, chic parks and great promenades by the river. The new reality for those left behind is tough. Coming out from their hideouts after more than three weeks without electricity or running water, they are met by huge craters and wrecked structures. There are mountains of steel, concrete, glass and plastic. Here and there, torn posters and paintings, as well as small pieces of metal adding to a truly dystopian scene. Everywhere there are buildings – including hospitals, schools, libraries and residential blocks – that have been destroyed. One of the places that lies in ruins is the local football ground. Sadly, it is a perfect illustration of the effects that the Russian invasion has had throughout Ukraine. Before the bombs destroyed it, it could hold 12,000 people – the local side, FC Desna, played in the Ukrainian Premier League there, as did the women’s national side. Now, it has been reduced to rubble. The stands are destroyed, the windows broken. What remains of the once proud stadium has been left with metre-long cracks. In addition, items including gym equipment, TVs and other accessories were stolen from the offices. On the pitch, meanwhile, there are craters as deep as four metres. “At least five rockets hit the stadium. It’s all destroyed,” says Oleksandr Lomako, Chernihiv’s regional governor. “This is civil infrastructure. The club had no military connections, there were no soldiers, no equipment, nothing. We used this complex for adults as well as children. From 24 February, Chernihiv was under constant shelling. “All the buildings that have been bombed are part of the civil infrastructure,” he adds. “What will the kids do now? Where will they train once the war is over?” “After the enemy blew up the bridge over the Desna river, Chernihiv became an island,” the Chernihiv deputy regional governor, Dmytro Ivanov, explains. “The Russians circled the city then started bombing our food supplies, our humanitarian aid, as well as the gas stations. There was no electricity; hundreds of people were dying. We could not even bury them.” As recently as the 2019-20 season Desna enjoyed their best-ever campagin, qualifying for Europe after finishing fourth in the league. They played German club Wolfsburg in the third preliminary round of the Europa League, losing 2-0 in a single-legged qualifier. Before the war started, Desna were seventh in the Ukrainian league. The stadium has a proud history – and a surprising former name – too. In 1961 Yuri Gagarin became the first human to travel into space. The then 27-year-old became a hero throughout the world, and the Russian communist authorities awarded him the Order of Lenin and the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Three years after earning global acclaim, Gagarin visited the stadium in Chernihiv to meet his fellow cosmonaut, Andriyan Nikolayev. The moment needed to be marked, so the stadium was named after Gagarin. Despite it now being renamed to the Olympic sports training centre, the locals still call it “The Gagarin”. All is not lost. Local and national authorities have promised the club that the stadium will be rebuilt. The Ukrainian culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, has held talks with his German counterparts, who assured him of their support. Borussia Dortmund have also promised to help out. “They have not forgotten Andriy Yarmolenko,” Tkachenko said, referring to the West Ham forward who grew up in Chernihiv and started his professional career with Desna, before moving on to Dynamo Kyiv and Dortmund. Help may be on the way but Desna supporters have already gathered to clear up at their stadium. At the weekend a symbolic amateur match was even organised at the Gagarin, on the side of the pitch where the bombs did not land. Football is injecting some life back into the stadium and the club’s faithful. The first team manager, Oleksandr Ryabokon, joined the Ukrainian defence forces at the beginning of April. “He’s clearing Kyiv of Russian creatures,” a Desna club spokesperson says. The Under-19 coach, Oleksandr Zub, is also part of the military operation, as are the club’s ex-owner, Ivan Chaus, and former player Dmytro Zaderetsky. Together with Mariupol and Kharkiv, Chernihiv is now a “hero city” following a decision by the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Ukrainian soldiers have promised the city’s residents the Russians will not return but, having witnessed the atrocities over the past two months, the people are afraid to believe them. “We don’t know when and how this war will end,” says a Desna supporter called Oleg. “We are normal people, but our normal lives have been taken away. We just don’t understand why someone would attack and kill innocent civilians. “I go to the stadium every day with a couple of friends. It’s the only place in the city where you can hope to hear the voices of some happy children. It is football, the memories it brought us, and the hope of a normal future, that keeps us going.”",Sport/Football,Football in Ukraine: ‘Where will the kids train now?’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/football-in-ukraine-where-will-the-kids-train-now
4/23/2022,"The far-right Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene appeared in court in Georgia on Friday for a hearing in an attempt to bar her from Congress for aiding the insurrection at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. A lawyer for Greene, James Bopp, tried to portray her as a “victim” of the Capitol attack, rather than an instigator. Ron Fein, for the challengers, said: “The most powerful witness against Marjorie Taylor Greene’s candidacy … is Marjorie Taylor Greene herself.” Greene, who testified, is set to appear on the Republican ballot for Georgia’s 24 May primary and has been endorsed by Donald Trump. The administrative judge overseeing the hearing will present his findings to Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, who will then determine whether Greene is qualified. Raffensperger, a Republican, stood up to Trump when the then president tried to overturn Joe Biden’s 2020 victory in Georgia. Raffensperger has said that as a result, he feared for his family’s safety. In a statement on Thursday, Trump incorrectly blamed Raffensperger and the Georgia governor, Brian Kemp, for allowing the challenge against Greene, saying she was “going through hell in their attempt to unseat her”. The effort to bar Greene from re-election was brought by a coalition of voters and liberal groups and comes under the 14th amendment to the US constitution. Passed after the civil war, the amendment was written to prevent anyone sitting in Congress if they have “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” or “given aid or comfort to the enemies” of the constitution. On Friday, some in the room in Atlanta cheered and applauded as Greene took her seat – prompting the judge to later say such behaviour would not be tolerated. Matt Gaetz of Florida, another far-right Republican and Trump supporter, was in the room. He tweeted: “I’m here in Atlanta to support ⁦[Greene] against the assault on democracy that is this effort to remove her from the ballot.” As the hearing began, Greene tweeted: “Only the People have the right to choose who they send to Congress.” Supporters of Trump attacked Congress on 6 January 2021 in an attempt to stop certification of his defeat by Biden, in service of Trump’s lies about electoral fraud. A bipartisan Senate committee connected seven deaths to the riot. More than 100 officers were hurt. About 800 people, including members of far-right and militia groups, have been charged, some with seditious conspiracy. Trump was impeached for inciting an insurrection but acquitted. A House investigation continues. Organisers of events on January 6 have said Greene communicated with them. Greene has denied it and said she does not encourage violence. In October, however, she told a podcast hosted by Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist: “January 6 was just a riot at the Capitol and if you think about what our Declaration of Independence says, it says to overthrow tyrants.” After the riot, Greene was one of 147 Republicans in Congress who objected to results in battleground states. An effort to use the 14th amendment against Madison Cawthorn, a Trump ally from North Carolina, was unsuccessful, after a judge ruled an 1872 civil war amnesty law was not merely retroactive. In Greene’s case, a federal judge said the 1872 law did not apply. In Atlanta on Friday, Bopp said the challengers were making a very serious charge. “They want to deny the right to vote to the thousands of people living in the 14th district of Georgia by removing Greene from the ballot,” he said, adding that Greene “did not engage in the attack on the Capitol”. Greene met Trump about objections to state results because of concerns about voter fraud, Bopp said. At the time of the riot, he said, she was at the Capitol urging people via social media to be safe and remain calm. “Representative Greene was a victim of this attack,” Bopp said, adding that she believed her life could be in danger. The challenge opened with questioning of a historian about the 14th amendment and uprisings including the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, which was quashed by George Washington. Ron Fein, a lawyer for the voters who filed the challenge, said Greene took an oath but broke it by engaging in an insurrection. Unlike past insurrections, Fein said: “The leaders of this insurrection were among us, on Facebook, on Twitter, on corners of social media that would make your stomach hurt.” Although Greene was not on the steps of the Capitol, she played an important role in stoking Republican fury, Fein said. The day before the insurrection, Greene posted: “It’s our 1776 moment!” on the conservative-friendly Parler platform. “The most powerful witness against Marjorie Taylor Greene’s candidacy … the most powerful witness in establishing that she crossed the line into engagement in insurrection is Marjorie Taylor Greene herself,” Fein said. Bopp raised frequent objections. When Greene took the stand, the lawyer Andrew Celli became frustrated when she did not directly answer or said he was speculating. Celli asked the court “to acknowledge that this is an adverse witness” and said: “Ms Greene, I’m just asking questions.” “I’m just answering,” Greene said. Celli asked Greene about posts on social media and other statements. Greene repeatedly said she did not recall them. Whenever Celli suggested Greene endorsed the use of violence to interrupt the certification of the electoral votes, Greene said she did not support violence and was encouraging peaceful protest. Celli played a clip of an interview the day before the riot in which Greene referred to “our 1776 moment”. Asked if she was aware some Trump supporters saw that as a call to violence, Greene said that was not her intention and she was talking about plans to object to electoral votes. “I was talking about the courage to object,” she said.

4/23/2022,"There is no shortage of art’s big beasts in Venice, as the world’s most prestigious international art event, the city’s biennale, opens to the public. Georg Baselitz has made works to hang in the 18th-century stucco frames that once held portraits of the Grimani family in their palazzo. Marc Quinn is showing in the National Archaeological Museum. Anselm Kiefer has covered the walls of a colossal room in the Palazzo Ducale with paintings encrusted with shoes, clothing, metal, and even a ladder. Arguably, though, the dominant spirit of the event lies beyond these impressively housed exhibitions. In the main venues of the biennale – the city’s Giardini and Arsenale – the overwhelming feeling is not of the lone, male, white artist. Instead, for the first time, female artists outnumber men – and by a ratio of roughly nine to one. Of the more than 200 artists the curator Cecilia Alemani is showing in her huge main exhibition, the vast majority are women. One of her venues, the international pavilion of the Giardini, contains no male artists at all, only women and a small number of non-binary and transgender artists. “I have always worked with many women artists – and I think some of the most talented artists working today are women,” the Italian, US-based curator said. Historically, about 10% of artists in the main exhibition have tended to be women, rising to 30% in recent years; in 2019, the UK-based curator Ralph Rugoff’s exhibition achieved a rough parity for the first time. Alemani’s show is approximately 90% women. “I don’t care about quotas,” she added, “but it’s striking that people are obsessing about my exhibition and never found the dominance of men [in previous editions] shocking.” Characteristic of the biennale’s atmosphere is, for example, the Polish pavilion: the Roma artist Małgorzata Mirga-Tas has covered the walls of the structure with tapestry-like patchworks, partly based on frescoes in the Palazzo Schifanoia in Ferrara, that pay homage to individual pioneering Roma women. Next door to the Polish pavilion, Adina Pintilie’s talked-about Romanian pavilion, and her cast of collaborators, whom she called “wonderful, brave, soul searchers”, including gay, trans, and disabled people, are challenging normative views of relationships, the body and intimacy. In her film work You Are Another Me – Cathedral of the Body she was interested, she said, in “opening up different ways of relating to different bodies, different beauties”. Black women occupy some of the most prominent national pavilions: the sculptor Simone Leigh for the US; Sonia Boyce for Great Britain; and Zineb Sedira, who is of Algerian descent, for France. Sedira, whose exhibition meditates on the history of Algerian, French and Italian film, said: “I’m a woman artist who works in a male-dominated world. The 1960s and 70s film world was definitely a man’s world. I really wanted to reappropriate that space as a woman, as an Algerian, as a Muslim, as a French, as a British.” Like Boyce’s exhibition, which foregrounds Black female musicians, Sedira’s show is strongly embedded in ideas of friendship. The same is true of Alberta Whittle’s exhibition for Scotland, which reflects on the traumatic history of the slave trade and colonialism between Africa, Scotland and Barbados, where she was born. “I find it interesting that so many of us – Sonia Boyce, Simone Leigh – are members of the West Indian diaspora,” said the Glasgow-based Whittle. “It’s a perspective that has long been ignored.” Tender and touching despite everything, her work is made, said Whittle, “through a spirit of hope and rage”. It was, she said, “a fatiguing position” to be the first Black woman to represent her country, along with Boyce, Leigh, and Sedira. “That said, I feel honoured. It’s like showing my work in the big league.” “The world is awakening and realising that it is finally time,” said Alemani. “I think it’s puzzling that though the American pavilion was built in 1930, and the British pavilion was built in 1912, it has taken until now for Black women to occupy them. But we need to go beyond the shock and use this time to reflect on the past and reinterpret history and understand how we got to this point.” Her exhibition, titled The Milk of Dreams, was “reconsidering the centrality of man, to celebrate a different relationship with the planet and nature and different species,” she said. That involved “decentring the western, usually white male perspective”. She pointed to the work, for example, of the Colombian artist Delcy Morelos, whose work was a discovery for her as she researched her exhibition, and whose large earth “maze” occupies one of the broad spaces of the Arsenale. Morelos’s installation is “infused with tobacco, cocoa powder, cloves”, she explained. “You experience the art with the fullness of the body – something I have missed very much during the pandemic.” The Venice Biennale continues until 27 November.",Arts/Art and design,Venice Biennale: women outnumber male artists in main halls for first time,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/22/venice-biennale-female-artists-outnumber-males-for-first-time
4/23/2022,"A Memphis prosecutor has dropped all criminal charges against Pamela Moses, the Memphis woman who was sentenced to six years in prison for trying to register to vote. Moses was convicted last year and sentenced in January. She was granted a new trial in February after the Guardian published a document showing that had not been given to her defense ahead of the trial. Moses was set to appear in court on Monday to find out whether prosecutors would pursue a retrial. The central issue in her case was whether she had known she was ineligible to vote when a probation officer filled out and signed a form indicating she was done with probation for a 2015 felony conviction and eligible to cast a ballot. Even though the probation officer admitted he had made a mistake, and Moses said she had no idea she was ineligible to vote, prosecutors said she knew she was ineligible and had deceived him. Moses stood in the lobby of the probation office while the officer went to his office to research her case for about an hour, he said at trial. The case stirred national outrage because it underscored disparities in the way Black people are punished for voting errors. Several white defendants elsewhere have been sentenced to probation for impersonating family members and voting on their behalf. Reached by telephone, Moses declined to comment on Friday, saying she was still processing the news. She said she planned to hold a press conference on Monday in Memphis. Amy Weirich, the Shelby county district attorney, who prosecuted the case, noted Moses had spent 82 days in jail before she was granted a new trial, “which is sufficient”. “In the interest of judicial economy, we are dismissing her illegal registration case and her violation of probation,” she said in a statement. She noted that Moses is permanently barred from voting in Tennessee. One of the crimes she pleaded guilty to in 2015, tampering with evidence, causes people to permanently lose their voting rights in Tennessee. During Moses’s trial, the judge overseeing the case and the two probation officers said they were unaware that was a crime that caused people to permanently lose the right to vote. Tennessee has some of the harshest policies regarding the restoration of voting rights in the US. People with felonies cannot vote until they have completed all terms of their sentence, including probation and parole. They must have paid off all fines and fees and be up to date on their child support. They must also go through a process in which they get a probation or criminal justice official to sign off on their eligibility, and there is often confusion about the requirements. There is continuing litigation challenging the process. More than one in five otherwise eligible Black voters – 175,000 people – cannot vote in Tennessee because of a felony conviction, according to an estimate by the Sentencing Project, a criminal justice non-profit organization.",News/US news,"Prosecutor drops all charges against Pamela Moses, jailed over voting error",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/22/pamela-moses-prosecutor-drops-charges-memphis-tennessee
4/23/2022,"A man fell to his death from a burning block of flats after police arrived to look for a suspected arsonist. Five officers tried to get inside the property to rescue the man, in his 50s, but were overcome by the flames, police said. One officer sustained serious burns and remained in hospital on Friday. The others were treated for “minor injuries and smoke inhalation” and discharged, while a firefighter was treated by paramedics at the scene, Bedfordshire police said. Detectives had been investigating three attempted arson attacks on properties in Luton in the early hours of Wednesday and used CCTV footage to identify a suspect.The officers were dispatched to the apartment in Green Court, in a 15-storey block, at around 4am on Thursday but arrived to find the entrance on fire. Emergency services were called but police said the “fire took further hold of the flat” before the man fell from a window. Assistant chief constable Sharn Basra said: “This is a tragic case and we are working hard to establish all of the facts of what took place. “Our focus on Thursday was on identifying the man who had died and tracing his family members before we released any further information publicly. “We have also been carefully recovering all possible evidence from the scene and assisting residents who had been displaced from their homes. What is clear from the evidence collected so far is the bravery of the attending officer, who tried to fight through the flames to save the man inside. “Our thoughts remain with both him as he recovers in hospital and the loved ones of the man who sadly died.” The man has yet to be formally identified and his next of kin have been informed, the force added. The case has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. More than 100 residents were evacuated from the building on Thursday morning, with the majority allowed back into their flats by the evening. Luton council said there is no indication that cladding was a factor in the fire. The Bedfordshire fire and rescue service area commander, Stuart Auger, said: “The fire was successfully contained to the flat thanks to the efficient performance of the building’s fire protection measures and fire doors. “Thanks to this we were able to work alongside Bedfordshire police to efficiently evacuate all residents from the building with the help of smoke hoods. “Our thoughts are with the loved ones of the person who sadly passed away and we will work with partners to reassure the community over the coming weeks and months.” Anyone with information which may assist the police investigation is asked to call 101 or get in touch with the force through beds.police.uk/ro/report, quoting Operation Cheagle.",News/UK news,Man falls from burning block of flats in Luton,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/22/man-falls-from-burning-block-of-flats-in-luton
4/23/2022,"Education officials in Florida have been criticized for putting “political theater” over teaching after they revealed four examples from among the 54 math textbooks they rejected last week. The state said it had refused to use the books because of “prohibited topics” including alleged references to critical race theory. On Friday, however, after pressure to explain the decisions, the education department published several images of math problems from the textbook with the offending segments highlighted. In one example, a colored graph features levels of “racial prejudice” by age. Another example, under the heading “adding and subjecting polynomials”, begins with the words: “What? Me? Racist?” and uses the statistical results of a common survey about unconscious bias as an example for a set of mathematics problems. The other examples make references to “social and emotional learning” or “social awareness”, concepts that conservative education activists say are a gateway to leftwing ideology. “Those examples were given with no context and were not even elementary-level material,” Andrew Spar, president of the Florida Education Association that represents more than 150,000 educators, said. “So it seems like it’s more about smoke and mirrors of trying to accomplish a political agenda than really about what we are teaching our kids.” Florida’s banning of the books is widely seen by critics as an extension of Republican governor Ron DeSantis’s “culture war” on the supposed indoctrination of children in schools. He recently signed the state’s controversial “don’t say gay” law – officially the Parental Rights in Education bill – that prohibits discussions of sexual orientation or gender identity in elementary classrooms. His education department came under fire last week for announcing it had banned the textbooks without giving supporting details, and it said it was releasing the images “based on the volume of requests the department has received for examples of problematic elements of the recently reviewed instructional materials”. The department said the examples were not an exhaustive list, and provided the images with no descriptions or context. “Social and emotional learning” has been attacked by conservatives. Quoted in the New York Times, Chris Rufo, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, linked social-emotional learning to a wider discussion of race, gender and sexuality teaching in classrooms, and called it “a delivery mechanism for radical pedagogies such as critical race theory and gender deconstructionism”. Other content that Florida’s education leaders objected to are cartoon children appearing at the side of textbook pages encouraging students to “learn together”, to have “a growth mindset” by trying a new way to tackle a problem when they were stuck, or to adopt a “math mindset” to help understand their feelings. “Math is about getting the right answer. It’s not about how you feel about the problem,” DeSantis said at a press conference earlier in the week. In a statement, a spokesperson said: “The [Florida education] department is continuing to give publishers the opportunity to remediate all deficiencies identified during the review to ensure the broadest selection of high quality instructional materials are available to the school districts and Florida’s students.” Teachers’ representatives, meanwhile, dismissed it as “political theater” by the governor, who is, they say, focused on the wrong priorities. “What educators and parents are concerned about is if we don’t have teachers in our classrooms, or bus drivers to get kids to school on time, then our kids aren’t learning math or any other subject,” Spar said. “We’re expecting over 9,000 teacher vacancies by the end of the year, according to the state board that he appoints, and we have a massive bus driver, paraprofessional, cafeteria worker, custodian shortage in addition. We’ve heard the governor say or do nothing about it. “These kinds of antics and political theater going on over these textbooks is exactly what’s driving people out of the profession.”",News/US news,Florida’s examples of banned topics in math books derided as ‘political theater’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/22/florida-examples-prohibited-topics-math-textbooks
4/23/2022,"By attending the inauguration of a new JCB factory in Gujarat on Thursday, Boris Johnson might have thought he was leaving his troubles behind in Westminster. What harm was there in going in to bat for a successful British business owned by a big Tory donor? Plenty, it transpires. Mr Johnson walked into a major human rights controversy over the use of JCB’s bulldozers in flattening Muslim homes and businesses in Delhi and in states run by Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party. Mr Johnson should not have mugged for the cameras with the machinery used to intimidate religious minorities by a regime seemingly bent on creating a theocratic Hindu state. Perhaps he is unaware of the growing sense of vulnerability felt by India’s 200 million Muslims. But no one who is paying attention could miss what Mr Modi is about. He is the only person ever denied a US visa for “severe violations of religious freedom”. This was in 2005, after he failed, as Gujarat’s chief minister, to stop a series of deadly anti-Muslim riots. Earlier this month the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Washington was monitoring a rise in human rights abuses in India by “some government, police and prison officials”. The US often takes an instrumental approach in determining whether human rights violations are raised or overlooked. India’s democratic backsliding, coupled with Delhi’s refusal to speak out against the Russian invasion of Ukraine, probably tilted the scales in the White House. But Mr Blinken’s warning should have been heeded by Mr Johnson. Instead of keeping his distance, Mr Johnson hugged Mr Modi close. India is set to be the world’s fastest-growing major economy over the next two years. London joins the list of capitals courting Mr Modi, despite his refusal to choose sides over Moscow’s invasion. India’s bargaining power rests on appearing as a key element in western-led efforts to counterbalance China in the Indo-Pacific. One assumption is that India is so indispensable in geopolitics that its partners will not be offended if it also deals with some of their opponents. Another is that the country is competently governed and has the social and economic means to accomplish its policy goals. The latter is a live question. Mr Modi failed to grasp the scale of the Covid pandemic early on, and his mistakes meant that Delhi failed to fulfil its obligation to supply Covid vaccines to the EU. Last year, Germany’s then leader Angela Merkel wondered if Europe had erred in allowing India to become a large pharmaceutical producer. Britain’s prime minister pointedly described India as the world’s pharmacy. Mr Johnson, who faces political oblivion thanks to his own pandemic mistakes, might envy the ends – if not the means – of Mr Modi’s rule. The Indian prime minister has been in power since 2014. His success is built on an aggressive assault against minorities, with economic policies that favour the rich. Mr Modi’s populist repertoire sees him claiming that the poor are his priority, while doing little to combat inequalities. His appeal endures despite rising unemployment and Covid deaths. Judges rarely confront the government. Civil society opponents are jailed. But Britain is not India. The Indian jurist BR Ambedkar sensed a fatal political flaw in his fellow citizens: the tendency towards hero worship, which he said was “a sure road to degradation and to eventual dictatorship”. In Mr Modi, that prophecy might be fulfilled.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Boris Johnson in India: flying into trouble | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/22/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnson-in-india-flying-into-trouble
4/23/2022,"Voters in Britain are familiar with the concept of the “red wall” – a group of regional constituencies in the UK that traditionally voted Labour, but flipped to supporting Boris Johnson. For Australians unfamiliar with the lore, it’s a simple story. Johnson won the 2019 election by forging a new coalition of traditional Tories and pro-Brexit working-class voters antipathetic to the then Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Much was written at the time about this electoral realignment; swathes of people had moved away from voting according to their economic interests, and were now more motivated by identity and cultural affinity – a shift that also underwrote Trumpism. The red wall concept has surfaced in dispatches in Australia during the opening two weeks of the 2022 election campaign. There’s been sustained speculation among journalists and some pundits about whether Scott Morrison is currently attempting a Johnson-like flip, writing off heartland seats in metropolitan Australia at risk from the so-called “teal” independents and hunting for gains in outer suburban and regional Labor-held seats, like Hunter and Parramatta, to offset the losses. There’s a few things to say about this. Now you’ve heard the red wall story, it will feel very familiar. This recruitment exercise is not new in Australia – for the Liberals, this has been a 30-year project. John Howard used various culture wars to chip off a chunk of Labor’s traditional base. Tony Abbott weaponised carbon pricing to that end, and the scars of that corrosively cynical foray persist until this day. Morrison has pursued the same core objective, narrowcasting relentlessly to men who might vote Labor. In 2019, one of the pillars of Morrison’s recruitment strategy was the entirely bogus “war on the weekend”. In 2022, the speculation about Morrison and red wall strategies has surfaced in the context of a transgender rights debate that has erupted during the campaign. The current debate has been catalysed by two things – the first is the deeply offensive and insensitive views of the Liberal candidate in Warringah, Katherine Deves, and the second is Morrison’s decision to publicly back a private member’s bill from the conservative Liberal senator Claire Chandler banning transgender women from playing women’s sport. Trans rights is an established part of the culture war repertoire in Britain and the US, but the same toxic debates haven’t yet taken off here. If you follow politics closely, you’ll know the prime minister was limbering up pre-election to entrench his religious discrimination legislation as the cultural wedge of the 2022 contest – but his own people shot his torpedo out of the sky when they crossed the floor and effectively killed that bill. So we’ve had, are having, this trans debate – which is grotesque really, given the vulnerabilities of the community, particularly young people. During the past fortnight, Morrison has used this issue to foreground his own conservative values; court fractious elements of his own base contemplating voting for Clive Palmer or Pauline Hanson because of vaccination mandates and lockdowns; and also to recruit Labor defectors alienated by what they would consider the excessive relativist progressivism of contemporary culture. There are different views around the government about whether Morrison’s persistent signalling is a cunning plan or a found strategy (and by found strategy, I mean a snookered prime minister is making a virtue of necessity). I’ll need to unpack this a bit I suspect. The cunning plan scenario is Morrison and his brains trust sees the sustained contention as a net positive for him and the campaign – the latest successful instalment in a three-decade centre-right Australian project to hollow Labor’s base and fully entrench the Coalition federally as the natural party of government. There are costs – to be sure. It’s possible the government loses Wentworth or North Sydney as progressive Liberal voters make it clear they’ve had enough of Morrison and his plots and his brinkmanship. But small losses don’t matter if you can shore up the base, stem a leakage of votes to populist rightwing insurgents and pick up new voters who identify with your message. The found strategy scenario is Morrison is in irretrievable trouble. The “teal” seats are already gone, and marginals are also at risk. If you are the party leader in this scenario, all you can do is try to blast your way back into the contest, and if you can’t, then sandbag as many seats as you can. Sometimes you break back, or sandbag, by giving voters something new to chew on. But there are risks of course. The main risk is voters will become seriously irritated by the fixation on an issue they regard either as completely confected, abstract or immaterial. It is unclear to me whether the current conversation shifts votes when people are concerned about housing prices, inflation and jobs. Brexit, and the identity politics that hung off that, was potent. “Axe the tax” was total bollocks, but potent. But is this issue? Just as there are two ways to look at Morrison’s tactical motives, one offensive and the other defensive, there are also two ways to look at his decision to dig in behind Deves – a candidate who on any measure of decency should be gone. The first probability is Morrison chose Deves deliberately to ignite a culture war about trans rights that would smoulder away in the background in an election predominantly about economic management. Deves would speak to cohorts of persuadable voters, but at a micro level. But in the way of campaigns, where controlled burns can escalate into bushfires, the Morrison/Deves bespoke culture war has now become a macro issue. It now imperils the government’s chances of hanging on on 21 May because the whole wretched foray reinforces Morrison’s negatives among progressive Liberal supporters – his refusal to adopt a serious climate policy, his implacable obduracy on a federal integrity commission, and his complete botch up of last year’s #MeToo reckoning. But the problem is Morrison is now trapped. He might want to dump Deves to minimise the risk of a teal wash. But that’s now fraught, because if Morrison cancels the Warringah candidate, he not only loses face, he will galvanise groups like Family Voice or the Australian Christian Lobby or other well-organised conservative religious forces – as well as generating pearl clutching histrionics in the Murdochsphere. If Morrison dumps Deves, cue unhinging among the Fox News mini-mes who proselytise to the Liberal party faithful. Heavy is the head that wears the crown. Speaking of crowns, Labor will do everything in its power to dislodge Morrison’s between now and 21 May, and particularly over the next seven days while Anthony Albanese is in isolation recovering from Covid-19. Last weekend, insiders were reporting pressure was mounting on Labor’s campaign director, Paul Erickson, and the advertising team to go negative against Morrison. Why negative so early? Labor’s marginal seat holders, out canvassing and phone banking around the clock, were reporting swinging voters were more persuaded by negative messages about Morrison and his record than by their own positive policy pitch. This was particularly true in Queensland, where Labor has an enormous (perhaps impossible) job to do to bring Morrison’s numbers down. The view there is if Labor can turn this election contest into a referendum about Morrison, then victory is possible. Labor’s first negative advertisements about Morrison screened this week, before Covid forced Albanese off the hustings. The Labor campaign will deploy the front bench over the next seven days to fill the void. While it is very unhelpful for Albanese to lose momentum just as he had found his confidence on the hustings – particularly given a lot of voters are still on the fence because they haven’t seen enough of him – some in the Labor brains trust see (or perhaps hope) there is upside. Frontbenchers can go harder against Morrison than Albanese could on the hustings because putative prime ministers generally don’t get to be prime ministers by presenting as street brawlers. And if you want the campaign to be a referendum on Morrison – perhaps your best chance is to make him a solo act.",News/Australia news,The ‘red wall’ and what it means for Australia’s election campaign | Katharine Murphy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/23/the-red-wall-and-what-it-means-for-australias-election-campaign
4/23/2022,"Seven Russians now under sanctions were awarded controversial “golden visas” by the UK after Vladimir Putin’s regime first invaded Ukraine in 2014, the government has admitted. The government closed the “tier 1 investor visa” scheme in February amid the build-up of Russian forces on Ukraine’s border as it prepared to broaden its occupation beyond Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. Since the invasion, sanctions targeted at many of Russia’s richest businessmen have become a key part of the response by the UK and its allies. The measures have also prompted awkward questions for the government, with critics accusing it of offering an open door to kleptocrats and oligarchs, who in some cases are thought to have expropriated wealth from the Russian state on a massive scale. Much of that wealth has been used to buy luxury property in London. The golden visa scheme allowed people with at least £2m in investment funds and a UK bank account to apply for residency rights, along with their family. Before 2018 it is thought that minimal checks were carried out on investors or the source of their wealth. The government revealed that 10 Russians who received golden visas are now subject to sanctions, an increase from the eight previously admitted, in a written answer to a question from Stephen Kinnock, Labour’s shadow immigration minister. Kevin Foster, a junior Home Office minister said seven of those 10 Russian nationals “either obtained an initial grant of leave or obtained further leave via the route after 2014”. The government declined to name the people who received the visas, despite demands from Labour and Spotlight on Corruption, a campaign group. In 2014 David Cameron, then prime minister, said Russia must “choose the path of diplomacy and de-escalation, or face increasing isolation and tighter and tighter sanctions”. However, the latest data suggested that the government continued to wave through visas for Russian nationals now considered by officials to play key roles in supporting Putin’s regime. “Putin’s invasion of Crimea should clearly have been a fork in the road for how the British government viewed Russian oligarch investors,” said Kinnock. “It therefore beggars belief that – even after the threat posed by Putin to western security and British interests had been exposed – the Conservative government continued to award grants of tier 1 (investor) leave to seven of Putin’s cronies who would later be sanctioned.” Spotlight on Corruption said the latest revelation made it even more urgent that the government release a 2018 report on the golden visa scheme. A minister last month committed to publish it, but the government has not yet done so. Susan Hawley, the group’s executive director, said: “This is compelling evidence of the frankly shocking complacency in the UK government about Russian money coming to the UK even after Russia started its aggression against Ukraine in 2014. “The golden visa regime looks increasingly like a state-sponsored scheme to enable kleptocracy. The lessons must be learned for the UK visa regime across the board.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We have made it clear we will not tolerate abuse of our immigration system and we have closed the tier 1 (investor) route with immediate effect to ensure that those who have profited from dirty money cannot gain access to the UK. “We want to make it clear that the UK is no safe haven for those who enable the Putin regime. By implementing the largest and strongest sanctions package in the UK’s history, we are continuing to crack down on these individuals and making sure they pay the price.”",News/News,UK gave sanctioned Russians ‘golden visas’ after first Ukraine invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/apr/22/russians-sanctioned-uk-given-golden-visas-ukraine-invasion
4/23/2022,"Barely a month after two separate reviews of policing made the case for radical reform in light of growing risks, the Independent Office for Police Conduct has issued a fresh blast of criticism. The latest findings relate to the police’s approach to stop and search. The number of these searches carried out rose 24% to 695,009 in the year to March 2021. Almost 70% of stops – 478,576 – were drugs searches. While the Met points to the seizure of 4,800 weapons as proof that stop and search is a valid tool, the IOPC rightly asserts that the service – which uses stop and search more than any other – must, along with the UK’s other 42 forces, “balance tackling crime with building trust”. This has fallen to alarmingly low levels after a series of incidents that have horrified even many of those who are usually pro-police. The most extreme was the abduction, rape and murder of Sarah Everard by a serving officer. More recently, reports of the strip-search of a 15-year-old girl, carried out at school with no teachers or parent present, provoked outrage. An official investigation found that racism was “likely to have been an influencing factor” in the way this black child was treated. Last week it was announced that the school’s headteacher has stepped down. Racism is to the fore too in the stop and search review. In the year to March 2021, black people were seven times more likely than white people to be stopped and searched. Extraordinarily, the official police watchdog is now calling for people from black, Asian and other ethnic minority backgrounds to be “safeguarded” from the harms caused by biased policing. The Home Office and police chiefs should take up the suggestion of research into the trauma this causes, including to children and young people, and bearing in mind the disproportionate use of force including handcuffs. Allegations that one boy was searched 60 times over two years, starting when he was 14, are being examined. Racism in the police, of course, is nothing new. Nor is sexism. Arguably, the sharing of grossly offensive images and views on social media – for example by disgraced officers at Charing Cross station, in Hampshire and West Mercia – has simply given an uglier edge to pre-existing attitudes and behaviour. But what has become clearer recently is that flawed leadership has allowed the situation to deteriorate. The acting Met chief, Sir Stephen House, told MPs last week that his former boss Dame Cressida Dick had been wrong to blame the force’s problems on rogue individuals. Instead, it is “subcultures” that need to be rooted out – failures of supervision that must be faced. But while it is a relief to see this admitted – and it must always be remembered that police officers, like other frontline public sector workers, do a difficult job – it is impossible to have faith in any promised clearout. The outgoing chief inspector, Sir Tom Winsor, believes the problems are structural as well as cultural. The architecture of the 43 separate forces is “far from fit for purpose”, his final report said. He also raised the threat of infiltration by organised crime. Change is needed and the current home secretary, Priti Patel, is incapable of leading it. The opportunity is there for the government’s opponents to set out an alternative. Labour should take it. British policing needs an overhaul.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on stop and search: this can’t go on | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/commentisfree/2022/apr/22/the-guardian-view-on-stop-and-search-this-cant-go-on
4/23/2022,"Boris Johnson is preparing a “fix” to set aside some of the Northern Ireland Brexit arrangements in a high-risk move that could provoke a row with the EU and lead to further accusations that the UK is breaching international law. The prime minister told reporters in India that the UK is ready to take measures if necessary to “fix” the deal with the EU governing post-Brexit trading arrangements with Northern Ireland. The prime minister claimed the Northern Ireland protocol “does not command the confidence of a large part” of the population in the region. “The protocol really does not command the confidence of a large, large component of the population in Northern Ireland. We have to address that, we have to fix that,” Johnson told a news conference in Delhi. “We think we can do it with some very simple and reasonable steps. “We have talked repeatedly to our friends and partners in the EU. We will continue to talk to them. “But, as I have said many times now, we don’t rule out taking steps now if those are necessary.” His comments come two days after Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg warned the UK would “reform” the protocol if the EU did not. Speculation is rife in Northern Ireland industry circles that the government is planning an “internal market bill 2.0” as part of the Queen’s speech – a reference to the controversial 2020 attempt to unilaterally tear up some of the protocol. Northern Ireland minister Conor Burns told LBC radio he refused to be drawn on the specifics of the moves, which Rees-Mogg described as “in motion”. But he said: “I hope Brussels are listening to this conversation and other conversations. “I hope they will come back to the table constructively to allow us to change the protocol to make it work in the way it was intended. “If they don’t hear that, then the government reserves the right, as we have always said, as laid down in the protocol, to take remedial action.” The shadow Northern Ireland secretary Peter Kyle condemned the plan as “absolutely astonishing and incredibly damaging”. “If we just recklessly pull out of it unilaterally, how will any other country in the world sign a deal with us and think that we will honour it?” he said. “How will Prime Minister Modi react today when Boris Johnson asks for a trade deal if he is pulling out unilaterally of the last trade deal he signed?” he told Sky News. The government has always maintained its right to trigger Article 16 of the protocol, but this will force the UK and the EU back into talks. Rees-Mogg hinted two days ago that the UK would be triggering section 38 (b) of the parent EU Withdrawal Agreement Act 2020, which restates the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. But the move risks further accusations that, while the UK is free to legislate whatever domestics laws it choses, proposed changes to the Northern Ireland protocol may not be compliant with the international treaty signed with the EU. Giving evidence to the EU scrutiny committee this week, Rees-Mogg declared in relation to section 38 (b) of the withdrawal agreement: “We can do what we want, ultimately.”",News/Politics,Johnson preparing to ‘fix’ Northern Ireland Brexit deal,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/22/johnson-preparing-to-fix-northern-ireland-brexit-deal
4/23/2022,"A root and branch review of children’s social care in Wales is needed after the case of five-year-old Logan Mwangi, who was killed by his mother and stepfather after being removed from the child protection register, a leading social work expert has said. Prof Donald Forrester said the case highlighted critical issues affecting many children’s social services in Wales, ranging from social worker capacity and staffing shortages to high and increasing numbers of children being taken into care. Logan’s mother, stepfather and a teenage boy who cannot be identified for legal reasons were convicted on Thursday of murdering Logan after subjecting him to months of abuse and violence. Logan was found dead in a river with more than 50 injuries to his body. Forrester said it was impossible to prevent child deaths of this nature ever happening again and there were no “simple solutions” but the case offered an opportunity for the country to take stock of children’s social care. “We really should be taking a step back and saying: ‘is this [the current system] working. Or could we do it better?’” said Forrester, the director of the Cascade children’s social care research centre at Cardiff University. “Child protection is always difficult, and Covid made it even more difficult. What we have seen is a system already under strain coming under even more stress,” he added Wales has the highest proportion of children in care outside their home of all UK countries, according to latest figures, with Welsh young people twice as likely to be placed in care than in England. Numbers of looked-after children in Wales have risen by 80% since 2003. It also shares with other countries in the UK problems relating to child social worker shortages, with some councils reportedly having vacancy rates of up to 40% and heavily reliant on temporary staff. However, Wales is the only one which has not undertaken a recent review of children’s social care. Scotland’s care review reported in 2020, Northern Ireland’s launched in February, and England’s is due to report in May. The court case suggested safeguarding authorities in Logan’s home town of Bridgend potentially missed a series of clues and reports that Logan was at high risk of abuse. Just weeks before his death, social workers took him off the child protection register, suggesting he was not considered to be in immediate danger. The local safeguarding children board has launched a child practice review to determine whether and why social workers and other safeguarding professionals failed to take chances to intervene to save Logan, though this is unlikely to report before the autumn at the earliest. An inspection by the Welsh care watchdog carried out just months before Logan’s death found child protection teams managed by Bridgend county borough council were struggling to provide uniformly safe and comprehensive services to vulnerable children as demand rose during the pandemic. The assurance check by Care Inspectorate Wales, published in November, said the council’s support for some families was “fragmented” and inconsistent in relation to child safeguarding issues. It highlighted vacancies in children’s teams and problems coping with the volume and complexity of cases. It also found examples of good practice, and noted “positive examples of a multi-agency approach to risk management and of practitioners, partners and agencies working together effectively sharing information, identifying and monitoring vulnerable children and adults’ needs and risks”. The children’s commissioner for Wales, Rocio Cifuentes, said: “In respect of this case, we must allow due process to take place and allow the regional safeguarding board to undertake its review. “In the wider landscape, the Welsh government has consulted on its white paper for reform of social care in Wales; this work needs to be brought forward in line with the programme for government commitments, to ensure children’s rights are protected and promoted, wherever they are living.” A spokesperson for the Welsh government said: “This is such a tragic case and our thoughts are with everyone affected by Logan’s death. It is of vital importance now for both the child practice review and the planned inspection by Care Inspectorate Wales to be completed.”",News/Society,"Logan Mwangi’s murder: major review of Welsh social care needed, says expert",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/22/logan-mwangi-murder-welsh-social-care-review-needed
4/23/2022,"Football tactics are complex chains of reasoning. Football tactics have a chaos theory element. Football tactics must always return to certain key tenets of space and movement. Very bright people are employed to stare at this seeking the tiniest margins of influence. But sometimes you do wonder about the obvious things. For example, the great innovation of the past 15 years has been the way teams attack “between the lines”, as embodied by inside-forwards, false 9s and their many shades. We remember the story of Pep Guardiola’s late-night phone call to Lionel Messi back in May 2009, babbling about switching his role to “the Messi zone”. This wasn’t new: Hungary were doing the same thing to England’s rigid lines 56 years before. But it created a trend and pretty much all elite teams are now geared to attacking that area between midfield and defence, between full-back and centre-half. This is how the best players torture defences. Between the lines: this is the weak spot. So, just a thought. Why are there still lines? Why, if between the lines is such a problem, are we still offering up a flat back four, a three, a deep five? Why do defences still set up like they’re expecting an attack based on the previous 120 years of linear orthodoxy? It’s as though two decades after the invention of the musket the French infantry is still insisting the answer to this game-changing ballistic weapon is brighter battlefield tunics and a more inspiring trumpeter. And yes this kind of “child’s eye” tactical pub-chat sounds more convincing when it comes from, say, Johan Cruyff, who had the advantage of being a genius, seer and visionary. And no doubt most managers would prefer to avoid a 14-0 defeat while trying to stop Messi and Neymar with a revolutionary mix of false full-backs, “jagged lines” and messing up your offside trap. But there is surely some kind of innovation waiting to happen here. Struggling to defend between the lines? Don’t have lines. Jonah Hill can play me in the movie. This is a very roundabout way of getting on to Harry Kane and the Premier League goalscoring record. Kane has become his own attacking innovation in the past few years, a forward who doesn’t so much play between the lines, as occupy two orthodox positions, the 9 and the 10, in rotation. It has been fascinating to follow him, from the early days of high-throttle centre-forward play, when he still looked like an ambitious young Edwardian notary clerk who wants to marry your daughter; through to his current incarnation as creator, disrupter, goalscorer, and bearer of all those fragile Tottenham hopes. At the same time other elements in Kane’s personal horizon have continued to shrink. He turns 29 in July. Judging by the noises off this week he seems more likely to stay at Tottenham now, committing the entirety of his peak years to his boyhood club. And why not? The task of driving Spurs on towards one trophy, any trophy, is as noble as hoovering up the financially inevitable shared glory available at one of the mega-clubs. But if Kane does stay the pursuit of that scoring record will come into sharper focus, a marker of what he can still achieve. Does it matter? Are records really interesting? Why is this one even a thing when it simply refers to a commercially defined period of time, a graphic on Sky Sports, wilfully overlooking the fact Jimmy Greaves has 357 of these top-flight goals, Ian Rush 232, Tony Cottee 214? In this case the numbers are interesting, if only because the record itself looks increasingly like an anachronism, something that belongs outside football’s evolution into a game of systems and team play, of finding space outside those lines. These are the standings. Kane has 178 goals, 82 short of Alan Shearer’s Premier League mark of 260. He needs four 20-goal seasons from here, taking him up to 33 years old. It feels doable. Shearer scored a similar number past the same age. Kane just needs to repeat the most prolific period of his career either side of turning 30, not get injured, not become a midfielder, not play abroad, and he may just reach that summit. One thing worth saying at this point is: how good was Shearer? Never mind the longevity, Shearer also had three 30-plus goalscoring years before Euro 96 when he was one of the best players in the world. Memories may be clouded by the later version, who seemed to reinterpret football as a game to be played while walking backwards, arms outstretched like a man groping for the bathroom light. But peak Shearer had supreme mobility, passing, shooting power and above all a thrilling sense of ruthlessness. Like Kane, Shearer was also an outlier. Both stayed at clubs where Premier League games are the most vital games, and where your own ability to score is the key tactical element. How many footballers of that quality will do this from here? In any case the numbers are more equally shared now. Thirty-goal individual seasons are rare. Players move leagues more often. If Kane doesn’t get that record there is a fair chance nobody ever will. Certainly very few of the current crop are anywhere near it. Mo Salah needs five more seasons to get close. Romelu Lukaku is on a very creditable 118. The only other under-30 in the top 30 is Raheem Sterling, the only under-25 in the mix Marcus Rashford with 59. Otherwise it’s packed out with Dion Dublins and James Beatties, remnants of a time when the career centre‑forward roamed the land, nose buried in the rushes, blind to the approaching asteroid. Kane has found his own variation on the role of chief scorer in the time of between-the-lines, of team play and shared roles. It makes him a note of interest, a genuine star outside the elite; and who knows, perhaps the last great one-club goalscorer, out there in pursuit of his own white whale.",Sport/Football,"Harry Kane, the evolving outlier, may be among the last great one-club goalscorers | Barney Ronay",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/22/harry-kane-the-evolving-outlier-may-be-among-the-last-great-one-club-goalscorers
4/23/2022,"A German investigation into the 2007 disappearance of the British toddler Madeleine McCann could continue until next year, according to the state prosecutor in the city of Braunschweig. Officials in Faro, Portugal, said on Thursday that the convicted rapist Christian Brückner, 44, is an arguido, or “formal suspect” – the first time Portuguese authorities have officially identified a suspect in the case since Kate and Gerry McCann, the toddler’s parents, were declared such in 2007. They were formally cleared of suspicion in 2008. Officials in the northern German city of Oldenburg, where Brückner is serving seven years for raping an American pensioner in 2005 in the same area of Portugal’s Algarve region where Madeleine went missing, confirmed on Friday they had informed the prisoner of his new status. Madeleine’s parents said they “welcomed the news that the Portuguese authorities have declared a German man an arguido”. They said in a statement: “Even though the possibility may be slim, we have not given up hope that Madeleine is still alive and we will be reunited with her.” However, the state prosecutor in Braunschweig, Hans Christian Wolters, who has been investigating Brückner over Madeleine’s disappearance and four other alleged offences since 2020, said the news from Portugal was unlikely to indicate a breakthrough in the 15-year-old case. “We note the announcement from Faro, but it does not affect our own work in a significant way,” Wolters said. Asked if it were possible that Brückner was about to be charged in Portugal and extradited there from Germany, Wolters said he believed it was “rather unlikely there will be an indictment in Portugal”. It will be the 15th anniversary of Madeleine’s disappearance from her bed in a holiday apartment in the resort of Praia da Luz on 3 May, and Portugal has a 15-year statute of limitations for crimes with a maximum prison sentence of 10 years or more. The arguido classification “appears to have a procedural background in Portugal”, said Wolters. “A statute of limitations can be avoided that way.” Brückner’s lawyer, Friedrich Fülscher, told the German newspaper Bild that the Portuguese decision was a “procedural trick”. German police said in June 2020 that Madeleine was assumed dead and that Brückner was likely responsible for her disappearance. However, British officers continue to treat it as a missing persons case and her parents “still hope” Madeleine is alive. Germany, unlike Portugal, does not have a statute of limitations for murder, and the state prosecutor in Braunschweig is investigating Brückner for five separate alleged offences. They include three cases of rape and two cases of child molestation, the most recent being in 2017 where Brückner is alleged to have exposed himself and masturbated in front of a group of children. Wolters said his office would make an announcement regarding the next step towards a possible prosecution at the end of May, but “the end of our investigations into the McCann case is not yet in sight” and could continue into 2023. If Brückner were charged over the other alleged offences in Germany, likely to be at the end of the summer or in early autumn, he would need to either personally consent to be trialled in Germany or Portugal or the prosecution would need to reissue extradition papers from Italy, where the suspect was last arrested in September 2018 – a process that could take between two weeks and several months. If the suspect in the McCann case was to be charged in Portugal, Portuguese authorities would need to take the same bureaucratic step. Different national prosecutors in Europe can investigate criminal offences in parallel, although legal agreements in the EU are designed to avoid individuals being charged over the same crimes more than once.",News/UK news,Madeleine McCann: German investigation could last until next year,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/22/madeleine-mccann-german-investigation-of-disappearance-could-last-until-next-year
4/23/2022,"The actor Michel Bouquet, who has died aged 96, was already middle-aged by the time he found fame playing baleful, corrupt or complacent figures in films by the New Wave provocateur Claude Chabrol. He was a cuckolded husband who kills his wife’s lover in La Femme Infidèle (The Unfaithful Wife, 1969) and an advertising executive who accidentally kills his own lover in Juste Avant La Nuit (Just Before Nightfall, 1971). In between, he did some of his wickedest work as a wealthy tyrant besmirching his daughter-in-law’s name as he plots to gain custody of his grandson in La Rupture (The Breach, 1970). Each of these films paired him with the director’s wife, Stéphane Audran, and portrayed “the petit bourgeois household as unsparingly as Thérèse Raquin or Madame Bovary”, as the critic Nigel Andrews put it. Bouquet lent the most unsavoury characters a compelling inner life, even when they lingered only briefly on screen. In François Truffaut’s Hitchcockian thriller The Bride Wore Black (1968), he was one of the men murdered by a widow (Jeanne Moreau) seeking revenge for her husband’s death. His demise is especially grisly – he expires on the floor of his seedy hotel room after being poisoned – but the actor conveyed hidden dimensions which made the victim a plausibly pitiful figure, rather than merely cannon fodder. (“I can count on one, no, two hands how many women I’ve had,” he says.) He was equally fine, though scarcely more likable, as a detective in Truffaut’s Mississippi Mermaid (1969). Though many audiences first saw Bouquet in his New Wave films, he had decades of stage and screen work behind him by that point. Even viewers who did not know the face may have recognised the voice: his controlled, emotionless tones were heard in Alain Resnais’s sobering Holocaust documentary Night and Fog (1955). His narration was written by Jean Cayrol, who survived the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp; Truffaut called the 32-minute short “the most noble and necessary film ever made”. Bouquet was born in Paris, to Georges, an officer in the French army, and Marie (nee Monot), a milliner. He worked as a baker and a bank clerk to help support his family, then took acting lessons at the age of 17 from the stage actor Maurice Escande. He enrolled at the National Conservatory of Dramatic Arts in Paris; a role in the 1946 production of Jean Anouilh’s Le Rendez-vous de Senlis began an enduring association with that playwright which continued with Roméo et Jeanette in 1953. Bouquet also helped to popularise the work of Harold Pinter among French audiences, and was a tireless interpreter of Molière, Beckett and Ionesco; he played the lead role in Ionesco’s play Exit the King more than 800 times. It was Anouilh who co-wrote the screenplay for Monsieur Vincent, which in 1947 provided Bouquet with one of his first screen roles, and won the Oscar for best foreign film; he played a consumptive opposite Pierre Fresnay as the 17th-century saint Vincent de Paul. In the same year, he was seen as a killer in the drama Criminal Brigade. He played Louis X in Abel Gance’s La Tour de Nesle (1954) and a priest at a Catholic boarding school in Jean Delannoy’s Les Amitiés Particulières (Special Friends, 1964). His initial films with Chabrol — the knowingly absurd spy thrillers Le Tigre se Parfume à la Dynamite (Our Agent Tiger, 1965) and La Route de Corinthe (The Road to Corinth, 1968), which co-starred Jean Seberg – were hardly characteristic of either of them, and gave little hint of the rich collaboration ahead. In Borsalino, he was third-billed as a lawyer on the trail of gangsters played by Jean-Paul Belmondo and Alain Delon, though he got a bigger bite of the cherry as the title character in The Cop (also 1970), which showed a disillusioned police officer taking the law into his own hands a full year before Clint Eastwood’s Dirty Harry did the same. The unsparing depiction of police brutality and corruption led the French minister of the interior, Raymond Marcellin, to call for the film to be banned. In the dreamlike horror Malpertuis (1971), Bouquet was a mysterious Uriah Heep-style figure who quivers with delight while being abused and insulted; Orson Welles and Susan Hampshire co-starred. He was another cop in the murky policier Deux Hommes Dans la Ville (Two Men in Town, 1973), this time remorselessly hounding an ex-convict (Delon) in the manner of Inspector Javert from Les Misèrables – whom he later played in Robert Hossein’s handsome 1982 film version, with Lino Ventura as his quarry Jean Valjean. Theatre provided him with many of his most prestigious roles – he was presented with the best actor award by the French Critics’ Circle in 1976 for his performance in René de Obaldia’s Monsieur Klebs et Rosalie, and played Pozzo in Waiting for Godot two years later. On screen, there was a delicious reunion with Chabrol in the thriller Cop au Vin (1985), with Bouquet as a dastardly lawyer. Just as he had been “discovered” by the New Wave directors at the end of the 1960s, so he was now introduced to a new generation of cinemagoers via the imaginative and original Belgian comedy Toto the Hero (1991). Bouquet was the ageing, bitter narrator, who looks back enviously on the life he would have enjoyed had he not (as he believes) been swapped with another infant at birth. More plum parts followed. The director Anne Fontaine had him in mind when she wrote How I Killed My Father (2001), in which she cast him as an estranged patriarch returning to France to complicate the life of his son, played by Charles Berling. Bouquet won the best actor César for his performance in that film, and another for playing France’s former president in The Last Mitterrand (2005). He and Philippe Noiret reprised their stage roles as dyspeptic pensioners in Bertrand Blier’s film of his own play Les Côtelletes (2003). In Renoir (2012), Bouquet was agreeably spry as the elderly artist opposite Vincent Rottiers as his film-maker son, Jean, and Christa Théret as their muse. At 91, he was back on stage in Paris as Orgon in Molière’s Tartuffe. He is survived by his wife, the actor Juliette Carré, whom he married in 1970. His first marriage, to the actor Ariane Borg, ended in divorce.

4/23/2022,"Prosecutors in Portugal have officially named a German national Christian Brückner as an arguido, or suspect, in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. Usually translated as “named suspect”, “formal suspect” or “person of interest”, the status of arguido – or in the case of a woman, arguida – is used in Portugal’s legal system and in other jurisdictions based on the Portuguese system. Authorities use it to categorise someone who is treated by Portuguese police as more than a witness, but has not been arrested or charged. Robert Murat, an Anglo-Portuguese property developer who lived 100 yards from where Madeleine disappeared and who helped in the initial search, was made an arguido after detectives took him in for questioning. Murat was formally cleared of suspicion in 2008 and won damages for defamatory reports of his involvement in the disappearance. Kate McCann, Madeleine’s mother, was formally declared an arguida on 7 September 2007, after 10 hours of questioning by Portuguese police. Gerry McCann was given arguido status the following day after further police questioning. It wasn’t until July 2008, after Portuguese police had submitted their final report, that both parents were formally cleared by the Portuguese authorities of involvement in their daughter’s disappearance. “It is hard to describe how utterly despairing it was to be named arguidos and subsequently portrayed in the media as suspects in our own daughter’s abduction,” said Kate McCann, who added it had been “equally devastating to witness the detrimental effect” it had on the search for her daughter. Brückner, a convicted rapist identified as a murder suspect by German prosecutors in June 2020, has been formally identified as a suspect by Portuguese authorities. The timing of the move could be related to Portugal’s 15-year statute of limitations for crimes with a maximum prison sentence of 10 years or more. Madeleine disappeared on 3 May 2007, while on holiday with her parents in Praia da Luz in Portugal. Someone with the status has legal protection that is not extended to a witness, including the right to remain silent during questioning and the right to legal representation. Detectives invoke arguido status on someone as a preliminary to an arrest being made or charges brought, according to experts in Portuguese law. Investigators might treat someone as an arguido as soon as they have sufficient evidence but in some circumstances they have been known to hold back to give a suspect a false sense of security. In practical terms, a person has to be declared an arguido before they can be arrested and the approach of investigators to interviews typically shifts if someone’s status changes from being a witness. Once a case file is completed, the police pass it to the public ministry, the equivalent of the Crown Prosecution Service, which decides whether an acusaçao or indictment is brought.",News/UK news,Madeleine McCann case: what does Christian Brückner arguido status mean?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/22/madeleine-mccann-case-what-does-christian-brueckner-arguido-status-mean
