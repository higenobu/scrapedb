3/12/2022,"Chippendales founder Steve Banerjee subscribed to the old adage that no publicity is bad publicity. When he first established the male striptease shows in 1979 — a novelty at the time — he used every method at his disposal to promote it, according to his former employees and associates featured in A&E's new series Secrets of the Chippendales Murders. Even, or especially, if it meant making his business, which was first run out of a club in Los Angeles, look scandalous. ""In order to get free press, he would call up some of the local churches anonymously and say, you know, I heard that these guys are gonna be dancing over at this place, and they're actually naked,"" former dancer Hodari Sababu says in the first of four episodes. ""You'd have the church ladies [picketing] with their signs, then you'd have the media covering it."" Of course, then Banerjee would be interviewed and deny that nudity was happening. It wasn't. The men wore collars and cuffs inspired by the accessories worn by the famous Playboy bunnies. A vintage news clip shows a male reporter asking him how much do the men take off. ""It comes up to their briefs,"" Banerjee happily explained, ""so we do not have any nudity of any sort. And they all shout 'Take it off, take it off.' And we just tell them, 'No, this is it. That's all we can do.'"" He was having the ""greatest time,"" Sababu says of the revue, which continues to offer performances in Las Vegas — Jersey Shore's Vinny Guagagnino stars this month — and throughout the world. ""It put us on the map."" Bruce Nahin, a former attorney for Banerjee, said he would call the L.A. Fire Department to report overcrowding, even when they weren't. When they were, he'd report that too. In one local news interview, Banerjee is asked, ""What do you think's behind this?"" He answers, ""I wonder. I will definitely talk to the police commission to make sure that I do not violate the law in any way."" Another former dancer, Eddie Prevot, said the free publicity was an essential part of Banerjee's business strategy. ""The state liquor authority in California was coming in to shut it down,"" Prevot explains. ""So now it's hitting the news, and he built his business on negative publicity. They think they're shutting Steve down. They're doing just the opposite."" Still, there actually were things going down at the club that neighbors and church ladies would disapprove of. Sex was happening throughout the club. Even outside of it, one former employee says. In one scene, someone unfortunate enough to live behind that original Chippendales location tells a TV reporter, ""We've had people having sex relations on the lawn."" There was a lot worse than that going on at Chippendales, and Banerjee was behind much of it. He was later convicted of hiring someone to kill his former business partner. He died by suicide in 1994, hours before he was supposed to be sentenced.

3/12/2022,"(Recasts headline and lead) By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON, March 11 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin gave the green light on Friday for up to 16,000 volunteers from the Middle East to be deployed alongside Russian-backed rebels to fight in Ukraine, doubling down an invasion that the West says has been losing momentum. The move, just over two weeks since Putin ordered the invasion, allows Russia to deploy battle-hardened mercenaries from conflicts such as Syria without risking additional Russian military casualties. At a meeting of Russia's Security Council, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said there were 16,000 volunteers in the Middle East who were ready to come to fight alongside Russian-backed forces in the breakaway Donbass region of eastern Ukraine. ""If you see that there are these people who want of their own accord, not for money, to come to help the people living in Donbass, then we need to give them what they want and help them get to the conflict zone,"" Putin said from the Kremlin. Shoigu also proposed that Western-made Javelin and Stinger missiles that were captured by the Russian army in Ukraine should be handed over to Donbass forces, along other weaponry such as man-portable air-defense systems, known as MANPADS, and anti-tank rocket complexes. ""As to the delivery of arms, especially Western-made ones which have fallen into the hands of the Russian army - of course I support the possibility of giving these to the military units of the Lugansk and Donetsk people's republics,"" Putin said. ""Please do this,"" he told Shoigu. The exchange was shown on Russian state television. Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is essential to ensure Russia's security after the United States expanded NATO up to its borders and supported pro-Western leaders in Kyiv. Ukraine says it is fighting for its existence while the United States, and its European and Asian allies have condemned the Russian invasion. China has called for calm. Shoigu said the operation was all going to plan before requesting Putin's approal for the use of fighters from the Middle East. U.S. intelligence chiefs told lawmakers on Thursday that Russia had been surprised by the strength of Ukrainian resistance, which had deprived the Kremlin of a quick victory it thought would have prevented the United States and NATO from providing meaningful military aid. That was causing concern in Beijing, Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns said. ""I do believe that the Chinese leadership, President Xi (Jinping) in particular, is unsettled,"" Burns said. ""By what he's seen, partly because his own intelligence doesn't appear to have told him what was going to happen."" Shoigu said Western arms were flowing into Ukraine in an ""absolutely uncontrolled"" way and that the Russian military planned to strengthen its Western border after what he said was a build up of Western military units on Russia's border. ""The general staff is working on, and has almost finished, a plan to strengthen our Western borders, including, naturally, with new modern complexes,"" Shoigu said. Putin said the question of how to react to moves by NATO countries need a separate discussion.
