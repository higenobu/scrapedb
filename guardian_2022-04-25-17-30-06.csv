4/25/2022,"Any Tory MP who made misogynistic claims about Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, may face disciplinary action, a minister has said.Technology minister Chris Philp said he was “appalled” by a report in the Mail on Sunday about claims by unnamed Tories that Rayner crossed and uncrossed her legs during prime minister’s questions to distract Boris Johnson.He told Sky News: “Nobody should have to suffer the kind of misogynistic abuse that sentiment amounts to.”He said he expected that government whips would investigate who had made the comments, and that if the details ever emerged he would “imagine they would be subject to discipline”.Asked why Boris Johnson and the culture sectretary, Nadine Dorries, had posted identical tweets denouncing the claims, Philp said this was “nothing surprising” and because they had “reached the same view and they have used the same words”. Johnson is also understood to have written directly to Rayner. The contents of the letter have not been shared, except for one quote reported by the Telegraph that stated: “The comments were not in my name.” Interviewed on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, did not push for those responsible for making the claims to be identified and declined to say whether Labour would complain to the Independent Press Standards Organisation. But she said the Conservative party should be “talking long and hard to their MPs about what sort of things they should be saying and briefing to journalists”. She added that the “outrageous” claims about Rayner “shines a spotlight” on other female MPs’ experiences of sexism and misogyny.“I am sick and tired of the way that female MPs and women are treated in parliament, and if this story, this outrageous slur on Angela gets change, that would be a good thing,” she said. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Reeves said the slur against Rayner was “the sort of thing that happens day in, day out in parliament”. She added that Rayner was a “fantastic politician” who “brilliantly” substitutes for Keir Starmer when he is not available.She said: “She doesn’t need to use her sex to win an argument or put the prime minister off, or whatever was suggested in that article. She does it by the strength of her argument, and to suggest otherwise, it’s just disgusting and it doesn’t do justice to the brilliant women we have in parliament from all sides.”",News/Politics,Tories behind misogynistic claims about Angela Rayner ‘may be disciplined’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/25/angela-rayner-sexism-misogyny-tory-whips
4/25/2022,"Just Eat Takeaway’s largest independent shareholder has said investors should vote to fire the takeaway food website’s supervisory board and chief financial officer amid a steady decline in its market value. Cat Rock Capital, a Connecticut-based activist investor, said in an open letter published on Monday that Just Eat had “torpedoed the company’s share price by providing a misleading outlook” before its $7.3bn (£5.7bn) takeover of rival Grubhub in 2020. The food delivery industry expanded massively during the coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, and Jitse Groen, the founder of the Dutch Takeaway.com, tried to grow the company through two large deals. The Amsterdam-listed Just Eat Takeaway (JET) was formed in 2020 through the merger of Takeaway.com and its British rival Just Eat. It then bought Grubhub to give the company access to the huge US market, but the company last week appeared to accept the deal was an error after saying it was looking for a “strategic partner” or a sale. Just Eat Takeaway’s market value rose as high as €17.4bn (£14.7bn) in early 2021, before a series of profit downgrades led to a sell-off that prompted its value to fall to €5.5bn on Monday. Cat Rock said that the company had “destroyed” €16bn in equity value because of a “complete loss of trust in the management and supervisory boards’ capital allocation and financial management”. The investor, which owns a 6.9% stake with 14.8m shares, said it will vote against a series of shareholder resolutions at the annual meeting in Amsterdam on 4 May. They include voting against the supervisory board, the re-election of the chief financial officer, Brent Wissink, and the authority of the board to issue new shares. It also said it will abstain in a vote on Groen, who is JET’s chief executive and its largest shareholder, with 7.1% of shares. Another shareholder, Lucerne Capital, has also said it will vote against the board and Wissink. Alex Captain, Cat Rock’s founder and managing partner, said the Grubhub deal was a “capital allocation mistake” that had led to a 75% stock market decline despite the food delivery boom doubling sales. “We believe the bulk of the value destruction occurred because JET management gave investors a misleading financial outlook in advance of the two Grubhub shareholder votes, leading to two massive profit downgrades in 2021 and shattering investor trust in management,” he said. “JET needs a new chief financial officer to restore credibility with the capital markets and a new supervisory board to quickly refocus the business on Europe, use the proceeds of divestitures to strengthen JET’s capitalisation, and actively evaluate other strategic options.” Just Eat Takeaway was approached for comment.",News/Business,"Just Eat Takeaway investors should vote to fire board, says activist shareholder",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/25/just-eat-takeaway-investors-cat-rock-capital-share-price
4/25/2022,"There is some insightful material in this personal essay-film from Dutch documentary maker and journalist Klaartje Quirijns, avowedly inspired by Philip Larkin’s poem This Be the Verse about your mum and dad fucking you up. It’s a painful probing of a psychological wound in her parents’ lives: the death of Quirijns’s elder sister in a drowning accident. That undoubtedly contributed to the disintegration of their marriage and is something which her elderly parents have never talked about until now: she makes them open up to her about it, on camera. Quirijns was apparently moved to consider this, and to take stock of her own life and upbringing, because of having surgeries on her breast, though she doesn’t actually say the word “cancer” out loud, an avoidance that an analyst might have questioned her about. But at 75 minutes, this film strangely feels too brief to do full justice to the story, and it is in any case intercut with footage of another case of family trauma which Quirijns had evidently been working on for years before deciding to shift focus to her own tale. This second element is about the unhappiness of Michael Moskowitz, whose Holocaust-survivor mother was cruel to him when he was growing up; Moskowitz is shown talking about it all in sessions with his analyst, a wise and gentle man called Dr Kirkland Vaughans. There are points of similarity in their respective cases, and the film duly touches on them, but it sounds glib and it’s impossible not to wonder if Quirijns would not have been better off concentrating on the one story that is centrally important to her, her own, and digging deeper into that. This is a film whose potential is not fully realised.

4/25/2022,"When Turlough Downes left the roof box on his car after a holiday, he knew it would push up the cost of fuel. However, after he did the maths, he was stunned to find out by just how much … a lengthy journey across Ireland had cost 50% more in fuel. “It really caught me off guard. It wasn’t what I expected. I expected it to make a small difference, but I was really shocked,” he says. Downes, professor of mathematics and astrophysics at Dublin City University, has applied his knowledge of aerodynamics to fuel efficiency, to understand how drivers can save money. There are many reasons for cars to use more fuel and drive up the cost of motoring – speed, weight, how the gears are used among them – but many drivers will be surprised just how much money can be saved from slowing down and making small changes when behind the wheel. The reason for the jump in cost when you use a roof box is that the added weight and air resistance means more fuel is used to move. Curious to see how much more drivers who sped past him were spending on fuel, Downes has also examined the effects of slowing down. Motoring groups such as the RAC have told drivers they can save money if they drive at lower levels than the speed limit. This typically applies when travelling a considerable distance where they can reach high speeds, such as on motorways. The differences are significant, according to Downes. A driver on a 45-mile journey from Manchester to Leeds, using an average car, can save around £4.30 if they go at 50mph, rather than the national speed limit on a motorway of 70mph, using the current average price of a litre of petrol at £1.62. The savings are similar whether using petrol or diesel. On long journeys, the most important issue for drivers is air resistance, or drag. Once the driver goes above a particular speed – usually 50mph – extra fuel is being used to deal with the increased air resistance. “Most of the extra energy you need to go faster than 80kph (50mph) is involved in getting the air out of the way of your car as you drive. It is not the only thing that is affecting you, but it is the dominant one,” says Downes. And as you drive faster, the amount of air resistance increases. “If you go twice as fast, your air resistance goes up by a factor of four. If you go four times as fast, it goes up by a factor of 16, so it is really bad,” he says. “That is why it makes such a significance difference what speed you go at, once above 80kph.” In the case of a 2014 Golf GTI – which has a fuel efficiency of 37.2 miles a gallon – a five-mile journey at 50mph on a motorway can cost £1, based on the current average price of petrol. If you increase your speed to 60mph, that goes up to 1.22p; at 70mph, £1.48. This amounts to an extra 50%. Break the law, and drive at 80mph, and it will cost £1.78 for the same journey. The savings become more meaningful if you are covering longer distances, and are consistent for petrol or diesel in terms of the volumes of fuel saved. For the Manchester to Leeds journey, at 50mph, it costs £8.98, rising to £13.28 at 70mph. More fuel-efficient vehicles will achieve similar savings. A Honda Jazz with a fuel efficiency of 62 mpg will cost £5.39 at 50 over 45 miles and £7.97 at 70. For many cars, the “sweet spot”, where the vehicle is getting the best miles per gallon is between 50 and 55mph, when the engine is not labouring, says Downes. Slowing down is not the only way to reduce bills. It’s about how you slow down – specifically by not using the brakes too often. This is especially true in slow-moving traffic when you should avoid using your brakes unnecessarily. “With the more energy you put into moving faster … that energy, in the end, is turned into heat as you put on your brakes. So you’ll have burned all this fuel to give your car the energy and then you’ll be wasting it in your brakes. And you won’t have got there any faster. So there’s absolutely no benefit,” says Downes. “You should always go as slowly as you can in start-stop traffic. That is a huge benefit. If everybody did that, then the traffic jams would last much less time.” When he didn’t take off the roof box after his holiday in France, Downes got a swift lesson in how costs can spiral quickly. The box, which was the full width of the car, forced the engine to work harder to deal with more air resistance. While this will not matter when you are driving in the city, as the car does not have to deal with the issue of drag that it does on motorways, longer distances with a roof box will cost if you start driving at above 50mph. “You can certainly save yourself a lot of money by just taking the roof box off,” says Downes.",Lifestyle/Money,Not so fast: why going slower can save you a packet on petrol,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/25/not-so-fast-why-going-slower-can-save-you-a-packet-on-petrol
