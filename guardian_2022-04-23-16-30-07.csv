4/23/2022,"“Write what you know,” students are always told on writing courses, though it’s not advice that should be followed to the letter: fantasy and science fiction would be in a sorry place if everyone complied. Perhaps the past two years of isolation and lockdowns have made everyone more reflective, however, since suddenly any number of established film-makers are returning to their youth for inspiration. Even Steven Spielberg, never previously the most personal of directors, is going autobiographical with his next film, The Fabelmans. Two of this week’s VOD releases, meanwhile, find British film-makers tackling the cine-memoir to very different ends. Joanna Hogg’s inspired, opalescent The Souvenir Part II (now on all major VOD platforms, but also still streaming on Mubi) sees her continuing the portrait of the artist as a young woman that she began in 2019’s The Souvenir. The first film was predominantly a relationship story, as Hogg’s twentysomething alter ego (guilelessly played in both films by Honor Swinton Byrne) attempted to define herself through the perspective of a doomed, wayward man. The second sees the young film student defining herself as an individual, making a film about that troubled relationship, and discovering her vision in the process. It’s a brilliant work that transcends the specificity of its maker’s experience to say something resonant about the challenges facing any young artist. Kenneth Branagh’s honeyed Belfast isn’t half as complex a feat of autobiography as Hogg’s two-parter, though Bafta and Oscar voters obviously disagreed. His tale of growing up in working-class Belfast against the roiling backdrop of the Troubles is an earnest work of nostalgia, collating fragments of boy’s-own memories (preteen pranks, first crushes, dimly overheard parental fretting) against a wider historical context. But it never feels altogether personal or specific, down to its expected black-and-white photography and jukebox Van Morrison soundtrack. Its characters, including Branagh’s avatar, “Buddy”, played by the cherubic Jude Hill, feel more like archetypes of the milieu than tenderly remembered portraits. For better or worse, Belfast recalls a number of other childhood memoirs from British film-makers. John Boorman’s wonderful Hope and Glory (Chili) likewise pits the joys of childhood against the terrors of conflict (in this case, the second world war) with mordant wit and a keen eye for sensory detail, while Terence Davies’s The Long Day Closes (Apple TV+) – of a piece with its gorgeous companion film, Distant Voices, Still Lives, but more specifically autobiographical – pulses with palpable mourning not just for disappeared youth, but a whole way of family life gone by. Shane Meadows’s young-skinhead origin story This Is England (Amazon Prime) powerfully walks a knife-edge between childhood nostalgia and devastation of the far-right corruption of a scene he once embraced; childhood poverty shapes adult poetry in Bill Douglas’s My Childhood (BFI Player), kicking off an exquisite triptych of 1940s Scottish mining village life. Away from these isles, the French have long traded in vivid screen memoirs, beginning with Zero for Conduct (Mubi), Jean Vigo’s scorchingly angry 1933 recollection of boarding school abuse and rebellion – a key influence of François Truffaut’s indelible The 400 Blows (Amazon Prime), in which we see his neglected, misunderstood adolescent self halfway toward self-appreciation. Italian auteur Federico Fellini had already mastered the cryptic, deconstructed adult self-portrait in 8½, but in Amarcord (Google Play), he turns to his childhood – and the many eccentric figures that formed it – with greater warmth and ribald humour. You can see Paolo Sorrentino straining for the same jigsaw effect in his recent The Hand of God (Netflix), though it somehow doesn’t feel as illuminating. Spike Lee made the sweetest film of his career with Crooklyn (Apple TV+), an episodic family album chronicling one 70s Brooklyn summer, written with his own siblings. It has the humid energy and street smarts of his more politicised work, turned bracingly inward. The ordinariness of its portraiture is its virtue, in contrast to Cameron Crowe’s delightful Almost Famous (Now TV), a comedy of a high-schooler’s fantasy come iridescently to life – how many teens get to tour with rock bands and write for Rolling Stone? – that mixes authentic memory with a wink of tall-story exaggeration. Write what you know, and then improve on it. Moonfall(Entertainment in Video)Roland Emmerich’s gaudy, costly sci-fi disaster movie crashed at the box office, but has the makings of a cultish afterlife. Dunderheaded in concept, grandiose in execution and with an honest heart of B-movie cheese, it’s the rare dim-bulb blockbuster that actually rewards ironic viewing, particularly after a couple of beers. Sing 2(Amazon Prime)Any parents for whom the first Sing film has been permanently burned into memory may or may not be pleased to know that this perky, crayon-coloured sequel is all but indistinguishable from its predecessor: cute critters, catchy karaoke numbers, spot-the-celebrity voice casting, and a wisp of a let’s-put-on-a-show story to hold it all together. The 355(Amazon Prime)The film that Jessica Chastain and Penélope Cruz didn’t want you to think about while they were vying for the best actress Oscar earlier this year, Simon Kinberg’s incoherent, over-caffeinated spy thriller wastes an ace international cast – also including Lupita Nyong’o and Fan Bingbing – on a script full of girlboss platitudes and ‘insert chase here’ set pieces. The Tale of King Crab(Mubi)Italian documentary directors Alessio Rigo de Righi and Matteo Zoppis make an eccentric, alluring fiction debut with this folkloric adventure tale, in which a dyspeptic drunk is exiled from his Italian village to Tierra del Fuego: cue a gold-chasing treasure hunt in which a certain king crab is a surprisingly crucial ally.",Arts/Film,"Streaming: The Souvenir Part II, Belfast and the best screen memoirs",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/23/streaming-the-souvenir-part-ii-belfast-and-the-best-screen-memoirs
4/23/2022,"More than 200 years after Francisco Goya commemorated Spanish resistance to Napoleon’s armies in The Third of May 1808, his groundbreaking work on the horrors of war, Ukrainian painters, illustrators and cartoonists are trying to find an artistic expression as Russian bombs fall on their country. Like other Ukrainians, many artists had to abandon their homes – and their work – when war broke out. Andriy Roik at his studio in Lviv with Apogee Under the Question Mark Andriy Roik, who was born and still lives in Lviv in the west, exhibited at home and abroad before the war. “When the war started, all this [artistic] process stopped,” the 27-year-old said. “It was extremely hard to work and react to what was going on in the country. I volunteered by helping refugees who came to Lviv. I drove volunteers to different places. As an artist, I temporarily stopped my activities. The war made me act in a totally different way.” It took time before Roik could resume his work and learn to live with the constant sound of air-raid sirens, nights spent in bomb shelters and airstrikes that have become the new normal. Place of Changes 2: Roik says the artwork is about looking from different angles “At some point I started to adapt to the war,” Roik said. “It kind of turned into a routine. And in my paintings, I have a vision of peace. The peace that I want to see.” Roik’s first painting since the beginning of the Russian invasion, Apogee Under the Question Mark, represented his vision of a utopian state of peace “after those bloody, inhumane events that are happening now”. Sergii Radkevych, from Lviv, also struggled at first to focus on his art. Sergii Radkevych with his work Seven Deadly Sins in his studio in Lviv “It’s hard to explain,” the 35-year-old said. “It’s a very stressful situation for us all. I have never felt anything like it.” Radkevych said it was much easier to respond to the war at first by working with people on “mechanical tasks” like buying medicine or volunteering than by creating art. “To me, art is like a speech, a dialogue,” he said. “And it was very hard to build this dialogue. You are destroyed inside, and you just seem unable to find a way to speak.” A few weeks after the war broke out, Radkevych said he started to receive offers to buy his work from Japan, Europe and the US. He said he decided to use the opportunity to “show the whole world the violence and the aggression” of the conflict, which he described as genocidal. “We need to show [the] … real cruelty, ugly cruelty,” he said. Fragments of the Body, by Sergii Radkevych Daryna Momot, 28, is an art expert and co-founder of Cittart, a Ukrainian organisation that helps fund and find shelter and resources for artists. She is trying to promote the country’s painters, cartoonists and illustrators around the world, and has launched an app where people can buy the work of a Ukrainian artist with one click. Twenty percent of each sale goes to humanitarian relief efforts. “Art helps us realise what we are going through,” she said. “Art captures people’s experiences … This is important for the preservation of memory and its transmission through generations in its true form, as art is much more difficult to manipulate than to rewrite history.” Ukrainians are sitting in the bomb shelters, by Kinder Album The day that Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, Kinder Album, the pseudonym of an artist from the west of Ukraine, vowed never to leave her country. “I didn’t want to read about the war in the news,” she said, “I felt it was important to stay and feel all these events. I wanted to actually experience them. The whole atmosphere of fear, of shelters and threats, of bombings, helped me to make war art. “It changed in terms of speed,” she said of her process. “Because now I need to draw, I don’t have time to think, I need to express the feelings of the moment, because tomorrow something else will happen. Before the war, I had a lot of time. Now I don’t. And when I look at my drawings, which I did when the war just started, they capture totally different feelings and emotions compared to more recent ones.” Kinder Album’s I feel like I’ve been in those houses, and Two friends one wanted to leave one wanted to stay “Drawing war for me is like art therapy,” she said. “First of all, it is a way to express feelings and emotions. I just put them out of myself. And secondly, it is my routine and something I did before the war, so when I do it, it kind of feels as if there is no war, that these are peaceful times.” Nicole and Michelle Feldman outside their studio with a mural painted by them in Kyiv Before the invasion, the Feldman sisters, Michelle and Nicole – collectively known as Sestry Feldman – street artists, illustrators and cartoonists born and raised in Dnipro, had only seen war in movies. “So when it began, we started to panic. I knew I had to do something to keep myself busy, so I started to wash dishes. But then I realised it didn’t help, so I decided to draw.” Sestry Feldman with their map of Ukraine, in Kyiv The sisters, who are living in Kyiv, said they turned down a chance to leave the country. During the conflict, they have realised a series of animated cartoons on the war, whose main character is Vladimir Putin. In one instalment, the Russian president, depicted with an odd, square head, is having dinner at his monumental, long table, with an enormous bomb, his inseparable companion. Another imagines Putin’s life in a bunker. “Last year we made a cartoon about the future where all people have round heads,” Nicole said. “There is a special machine that makes them square so they’re more suitable for the system. But in cutting part of the head, they’ve lost many of their emotions, like empathy. This is why we represented Putin in that way.” At first the Feldman sisters drew tarot cards on walls, but when the war broke out they created a tarot card deck dedicated to Ukraine Momot suggested that during this conflict Ukrainian artists have also been reclaiming an identity “stolen” by Putin’s war. Alisa Gots in her studio in Kyiv Alisa Gots: Anxious Pictures and War “Malevich, Burlyuk, Sonya Delone, even the Kharkiv School of Photography are mistakenly considered ‘Russian’,” Mamot said. “Ukrainian art is not known in the world and is associated with Russia. “Ukrainian artists are finally able to speak to the world for the whole nation and create values that will be passed down for many years to come. The horrific events that Ukrainians have encountered, through art, are now taking shape.”",News/World news,The artists of Ukraine find their voice in a cry of resistance,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/23/the-artists-of-ukraine-find-their-voice-in-a-cry-of-resistance
4/23/2022,"If you’re holding off on the sunscreen because British spring is prone to false starts, I’m not going to lecture you – but I am going to suggest a compromise I believe will satisfy us both. Clinical advice is that we should all be wearing dedicated sunscreens of SPF30-plus year round, because skin-ageing UV rays don’t care how hot it is. Although in practice, most people wait until they might conceivably burn before committing to an extra layer of skincare. But if you’re not spending extended periods outdoors, SPF moisturisers offer a third way, provided they’re applied properly: to adequately protect, one must be more generous than one might instinctively be with a regular day cream. The texture should feel much the same. Those who love Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Moisturiser, have, in my experience, pledged lifelong allegiance to it, but I’ve never really understood the devotion until now. (I worship at the altar of Medik8 Advanced Day Ultimate Protect SPF50, a not-cheap £59.) The new and definitely improved SPF30 version of the Kiehl’s classic is enriched with olive-derived squalane, and the result is ungreasy, non-clogging moisture. The newbie costs £28 and spreads like cream cheese on a hot bagel, melts to nothing and sits obediently under makeup. It’s suitable for all skins but the very oily and very dry. Elsewhere, Paula’s Choice has the most consistently excellent SPF day creams across its comprehensive range, targeting every skin type. Calm Non-Greasy Moisturiser SPF30 (from £11) is notable because it uses mineral sunscreens suitable for the most sensitive skins, including those with rosacea. But unlike most minerals, it has a light, fresher texture that won’t make already oily skins greasy (it’s perfectly possible to be oily with rosacea, though you wouldn’t think it to look at the wider marketplace). Then there’s Lancaster, which is so famous for its dependable suncare that I’m guilty of forgetting about it. This column led me to reacquaint myself and to discover the excellent Sun Perfect SPF30 Illuminating Cream (£31, but consistently available for about a tenner under RRP online). Suitable for most skins, this gorgeous, luxurious-feeling moisturiser contains subtle but noticeable light-reflecting particles for just a smidge more glow, as well as broad spectrum protection. Glitter-fearers needn’t worry, but if you’re a fellow lover of glowy, shimmery primers, manage your expectations – this is not a dupe with benefits.",Lifestyle/Fashion,"We should wear sunscreen year-round: if that’s too hard, try an SPF moisturiser  | Sali Hughes",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/23/we-should-wear-sunscreen-year-round-or-try-spf-moisturiser
4/23/2022,"Tyson Fury and Dillian Whyte will enter the ring at Wembley Stadium just after 10pm on Saturday night with mutual respect for each other and the brutal uncertainties of heavyweight boxing. “We’re big men,” Whyte said a week ago at his training camp in Portugal, “and when one big heavyweight catches the other guy clean all plans and predictions go out the window. I know Tyson is the best heavyweight out there but I have been through so much to get this fight. I also know I can hurt him. I know I can beat him.” A couple of days later, in the shadow of the huge arena where Fury will defend his WBC title against his British challenger, the world champion and undoubted favourite was just as blunt and respectful. “Dillian’s definitely a fearless guy. I’ve sparred him a lot in the past and he didn’t show any weaknesses. So I’m anticipating a good fight, a real tough fight, because Dillian is a strong heavyweight who is in the top five in the world. He poses a real challenge, as do all these heavyweights. It only takes one punch to knock a man out as we’ve seen many times. So I’m not underestimating him. I’ve trained like a Trojan warrior.” Warming to his task, and stripping away all flowery talk, Fury added: “I break it down to the bare minimum and we have two big lumps in the ring, trying to knock each other out. It’s nothing new – just on a bigger stage. I will be leaving every ounce of strength and energy I have in the ring. That’s all you can do. You can train a horse for battle but the rest of it’s in God’s hands. If it’s written in the stars that I win again, we will have a drink after the fight to a very successful night and career. I’ll then get back in my car, drive straight to Morecambe Bay and take the bins out on Monday morning. Same old story.” Of course, in boxing, nothing is straightforward. Fury has had an often difficult fight week and there were occasions when he has been riled by persistent questions about his past working relationship with Daniel Kinahan, the alleged leader of a drug cartel. He has spoken in more detail about his plans to retire after this fight. Few people in boxing believe that his bout against Whyte will be his last – but Fury has had a lot of hard fights in recent years. Whyte, the 34-year-old Jamaican-born Londoner, has had to wait years for this first crack at a world title and he feels a burning resentment at the way he says he has been treated by the WBC and Fury’s promoters who he believes have cost him a significant amount of money. He will receive 20% of the record $41,025,000 fight purse. Whyte is convinced that the Court of Arbitration for Sport will eventually award him at least 30%, and possibly more. Starvation and deprivation scarred his early years in Kingston and, as a teenager, when he was eventually reunited with his mother in London, he fell into gang life. Whyte was stabbed on two occasions, and shot, but he survived. He fathered a child at the age of 13 and his life has often been tumultuous. As a professional, who had little amateur experience, he has won 28 of his 30 fights. He performed creditably against Anthony Joshua in 2015, rocking the future world champion, before Whyte was stopped on a seventh-round TKO. After winning his next 11 bouts in a row, and having long established himself as the WBC’s mandatory challenger, Whyte’s world was turned inside out again. In August 2020, in the midst of lockdown, he fought the old Russian warhorse Alexander Povetkin. The acute loneliness of heavyweight boxing engulfed Whyte after he was knocked out in the fifth round by a sickening uppercut. He had dropped Povetkin twice in the fourth but, just minutes later, he was unconscious before he hit the canvas. It says much about Whyte’s nerve, and the fearlessness which Fury recognises, that he demanded a rematch. His knockout of Povetkin was just as conclusive in the fourth round and proof of both his power and his mental strength. Fury acknowledges the danger that lurks beneath the seemingly obvious prediction that he is simply too skilled and resilient to succumb to Whyte. “Unless I’m Houdini, I’m definitely hittable,” he said earlier this week. “I’ve definitely been hit before. I’ve been bounced off the canvas more times than a bouncy ball. So I’m not this untouchable boxer that everyone thinks I might be. I’m just a normal boxing man who has got lucky 32 times in a row.” He remains unbeaten after those 32 fights and Fury really believes he is the best heavyweight in the world by some distance, “I know he thinks he’s the six foot nine inch version of Muhammad Ali, George Foreman and Mike Tyson rolled into one,” Whyte said, “but he’s only a man. Obviously the crowd does play a part and there are going to be 94,000 people there. I know it’s going to be a pro-Fury crowd. Who cares? That’s the great thing about sport and especially heavyweight boxing. The underdog can always win.” It will, however, be a seismic shock if Whyte prevails. For all the enduring unpredictability of some heavyweight contests, and the volatile lives of both men, Fury should win again. Despite all his fervent talk of retirement, it would be much more of a surprise if does not return to the ring for at least one or two more fights after Saturday night.",Sport/Sport,Tyson Fury is rightly wary but Dillian Whyte win would be a seismic shock,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/23/tyson-fury-is-rightly-wary-but-dillian-whyte-win-would-be-a-seismic-shock
4/23/2022,"‘Where there is no vision,” the Bible tells us, “the people perish.” It’s a lesson absorbed by Sayon Hughes, son of an African-Caribbean pastor, the Bristol “yute” who is the ambitious protagonist of Moses McKenzie’s impressive debut, An Olive Grove in Ends. But there’s a snag. Sayon’s admirable vision for social mobility – to escape the mean streets of Ends and buy a grand house overlooking the Avon Gorge – is predicated on him selling enough heroin to put down a substantial deposit on his dream home. And it’s further complicated by the little matter that our narrator observes after only a few pages: “Blue-and-white police tape cordoned off the footpath where I’d taken Cornell’s life not two days ago.” Sayon is a killer. But he’s not on the run, because those who witness his stabbing of Cornell, a rival drug dealer, are either destined for an early death themselves or obey the local code of silence, an omertà that pervades Ends. Early on, McKenzie offers a striking description of Sayon’s Ends, an impoverished multicultural neighbourhood in Bristol, close to St Paul’s, called Stapes or Stapleton Road. It is split in two by a carriageway: “The first part was mini-Mogadishu … the second (top side) was likkle Kingston.” Ends was where “once you arrived you only left when those in charge wanted to rebrand”. But Stapes is on the road to gentrification. “Seven years ago the only white people you saw had black children, dreads or drug addictions,” notes Sayon. Now he’s vexed because the community is being leeched by “proper-looking white people”. The writing, resplendent with streetwise Jamaican-English, illuminates a gritty urban realism: alleys filled with used syringes among the detritus picked through by foxes; the coercion of teenagers by sexual predators who “lotion girls with newfound riches”. The novel, though, is as intellectually reflective as it is determined to show the young author’s raw bona fides. Many passages convey the cynicism of the adult residents: Sayon’s unforgiving mother “poured past relationships down the drain like a wino intent on betterment”; at a local Baptist church, the elders “earned their wisdom through a lifetime of mistakes” and took pleasure “in seeing their children falter as they had”. McKenzie’s prose, especially the dialogue, wrestles with a conundrum: how to navigate the tension between instances where the language is heightened by a vernacular that lifts it above the ordinary, and the majority of exchanges, which have a soap-opera banality. It succeeds, largely, in being closer to The Wire than EastEnders, though at times the author betrays his inexperience by telegraphing future dramatic turning points, and through a tendency to keep on restating the constant jeopardy faced by Sayon. At the heart of the novel is a love story between Sayon and Shona. Both are children of priests – one, Pastor Hughes, is the patriarch of an extended criminal family renowned for their violence, and the other, Pastor Lyle, though sceptical about his daughter’s boyfriend, is “a man who had dragged the darkness from his past”, and sees something of himself in Sayon. Pastor Lyle believes the yute is a candidate for compassion, even if his love for Shona will not cover the multitude of his sins. Sayon is also, believes his cousin Hakim – a proselytising Muslim – primed for religious conversion. McKenzie depicts Sayon as a stand-in for the many young Black Britons whose trajectory propels them through a pipeline from school to exclusion to prison; Sayon is first excluded, not unreasonably, when he “floors a teacher”. But despite his tough exterior, he’s self-conscious in the presence of adults and worries about the impact of his sins, “an airborne contagion”, on others. Mostly unencumbered by a sense of guilt for Cornell’s murder, he’s weighed down by remorse over the plight of a cousin, Winnie, who overdosed on the “food” that Sayon sells. Ultimately An Olive Grove in Ends is a fable, peppered with biblical and Qur’anic epigraphs, and with Jamaican proverbs that inform its spiritual tone. Announcing the arrival of a promising 23-year-old author whose work is wise beyond his years, the novel is both a tale of redemption and a guide for how young, disaffected Black Britons – especially descendants of the enslaved – might, as Bob Marley advises, emancipate themselves from mental slavery.

4/23/2022,"In an interview broadcast last weekend, Jake Tapper of CNN put it to Volodymyr Zelenskiy that he might not survive the war with Russia and asked how he would want to be remembered. “A human being that loved life to the fullest and loved his family and loved his motherland – definitely not a hero,” the Ukrainian president replied through an interpreter. “I want people to take me as I am: a regular human.” At the opening of the documentary Navalny, director Daniel Roher poses a similar question to Russian opposition leader, lawyer and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny: if he is killed, what is his message to the Russian people? Navalny challenges the premise: “Oh, come on, Daniel! No, no way. It’s like you’re making movie for the case of my death!” At that moment Navalny looks indomitable, a charismatic and courageous figure relaxing in a moodily lit restaurant in Germany. But today, less than 18 months later, he is languishing in a Russian prison while President Vladimir Putin wages a war that many call genocidal. Roher had no desire to chronicle a death foretold but understands the preciousness of what he recorded: “This was the last interview Alexei would give for many years. Maybe ever.” If Roher had a dollar for every time someone told him his film was prescient or timely, he would be a billionaire by now. The 98-minute Navalny premiered in January at a virtual Sundance Film Festival where it won both the documentary audience award and the festival favourite award. As Lindsey Bahr, a film writer for the Associated Press, put it, Navalny contains shadowy operatives, truth-seeking journalists, conspiracy theories, Soviet-era poisons and a handsome, altruistic family man risking his life to fight a would-be despot. She added: “Navalny is so taut and suspenseful you’d think John le Carré had left behind a secret manuscript that’s only just coming to light now.” Its subject is, like Zelenskiy, undeniably telegenic and invariably dressed for action rather than in suit and tie. He also has a story to tell. Now 45, Navalny grew up in a series of closed military towns outside Moscow, the son of a Red Army communications officer and an economist. He spent summers at his grandmother’s cottage in the Ukrainian countryside near Chernobyl. But when he was nine, in 1986, Navalny’s uncle made sure the visit did not happen because of an explosion at the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl. The Soviet government’s efforts to cover up the disaster, and his family’s related health problems, are said to have forged Navalny’s distrust of authority and desire for transparency. Roher recounts: “He told me these stories about how his grandmother would send his father a smoked salmon in the mail and his mother would bury it in the garden because she knew that it was pulsating with radioactive material.” Navalny studied law, took corrupt state organisations to court and blogged about the outcome. He released reports about corruption in the Putin administration, endured arrests and intimidation and tried to run for president. He also showed mastery of social media; his younger fans are all over TikTok. At one point in the film, Navalny tells Roher that he believed his celebrity might make him safer. The director can be heard replying: “Boy, were you wrong.” Navalny acknowledges with a chuckle: “Yes, I was very wrong.” Roher, a 28-year-old Canadian best known for Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and the Band, has never been to Russia. But he had extraordinary access during Navalny’s brief stay in Germany in late 2020 and early 2021 as the opposition star recovered from being poisoned and sought the truth behind the failed assassination attempt. The director recalls: “When you meet him for the first time, he’s a bit reserved. It was a weird context in which we were meeting and he was trying to get a vibe for us. But he and I became fast friends. He’s funny and charming and he’s the world’s best documentary subject: there’s nothing I could ask him to do or film that he wouldn’t let me do or film. “He has that quality that is often ascribed to master politicians, making you feel like you’re the only guy in the room, like you are important. That’s how I was made to feel when I met him for the first time but I had to be mindful that, in order for this film to work, I had to make this documentary with a critical gaze towards him. “This could not be a hero worshipping piece and I think he appreciated the integrity of that approach. To his credit, there was nothing that he wouldn’t let me ask him about. There was nothing off limits.” To illustrate the point, there is the troubling question of Navalny’s flirtations with the far right early in his career. Last year Amnesty International stripped him of “prisoner of conscience” status after reviewing comments he made 15 years ago – including a video that appears to compare immigrants to cockroaches – that they found amounted to hate speech. Roher quizzes him about having marched alongside nationalists and racists. Navalny responds that coalition-building is a means to the end of defeating a totalitarian regime: “I consider it’s my political superpower,” he insists. “I can talk to everyone. “Anyway, well, they are citizens of Russian Federation and if I want to fight Putin, if I want to be leader of a country, I cannot just ignore the huge part of it. There are lot of people who call themselves nationalists. OK, let’s discuss it.” The exchange brings to mind a line from Bertolt Brecht’s 1943 play Life of Galileo: “Unhappy the land that needs heroes.” Speaking from a New York hotel, Roher reflects: “Here’s a guy who was seeking the presidency of the biggest country in the world. Absolutely he must be scrutinised. Absolutely his past affiliation with these unsavoury characters must be questioned. We must understand what motivated him, what his political positions are and, to that effect, I must say he’s a really good sport. “I think the cornerstone of Alexei’s political philosophy is that debate and discussion is critical for a healthy democracy. He doesn’t shy away from answering tough questions. I hope I didn’t shy away from asking them. Of course, it was critically important. The film wouldn’t work if we didn’t do that.” But did Roher find Navalny’s answers about the dubious company he has kept satisfactory? “At the end of the day, Alexei is operating in the context of Russian politics, which is nebulous and complex and mysterious and candidly I don’t fully understand it. I don’t speak Russian. This is not my area of expertise. “But if he is to believed at his word, the way he perceives this is that he’s trying to build this coalition to defeat the authoritarian regime and that means having to engage with people that are unsavoury, that are not good characters. That’s a political calculation. “It essentially boils down to the enemy of my enemy is my friend and, while I don’t agree with that as someone who grew up in Canada as a liberal, I understand what motivates him, and I understand why he holds those positions and why he’s willing to engage with those type of individuals.” The film includes testimony from Navalny’s wife, Yulia, and daughter Dasha, who is studying in the US. Roher was stunned by their support for Navalny’s ambitions. “He has a spine made of steel, a character made of iron, and his family is right there with him. These are extraordinarily strong people. “Imagine being put through what Yulia has been put through and she’s poised and dignified with the air of the future first lady. It’s a stunning thing to witness and that matriculates down to his children Dasha and [son] Zakhar. How devastating it must be for them to have their father so far away and inaccessible. But I think the family understands that what he’s trying to accomplish is vital and important.” The central drama of the documentary is the poisoning of Navalny on a flight from Siberia to Moscow in August 2020; it includes footage in which he can be heard moaning like a man under torture. The pilot staged an emergency landing in Omsk where Navalny was immediately hospitalised. Yulia and supporters helped make the case for him to be treated elsewhere and he was soon transported to Berlin for medical care. After he emerged from a coma, the German government determined that he had been poisoned with novichok, a lethal Soviet-era nerve agent. The Kremlin denied the allegation. The film shows Navalny working with the investigative journalists Christo Grozev and Maria Pevchikh to track down his suspected poisoners. That staple of detective movies, an evidence board with faces linked by pieces of string, is on the wall with Putin’s face at the top. In one riveting scene at a rented Airbnb in Germany’s Black Forest, Navalny, pretending to be an aide to a top Federal Security Service (FSB) official, calls the suspects one by one on speakerphone – early in the morning to catch them off guard. Roher remembers it vividly. “I asked Christo the night before what his expectations were for the plan that they had hatched to call the murderers and Christo wrote it off and said it might be good for the film, it might not, who knows, but let’s just shoot it. “We did five or six phone calls before they got [FSB operative] Konstantin Kudryavtsev on the line. I don’t speak a word of Russian but, if you were there, you didn’t have to speak the language to understand something extraordinary was happening. “Maria Pevchikh’s jaw was unhinged, it hit the floor, and I understood that whoever was on the other end of this phone was duped. They got him and he spilled the beans and I’m just grateful that Niki Waltl [director of photography] and myself were there to capture it.” The documentary climaxes with Navalny’s January 2021 flight back to Russia where he knows that he will be immediately arrested and imprisoned. Roher cannot forget his last hours with Navalny. “I remember how palpable the stress was and Navalny, the nucleus of this moment, trying his very best to be light and buoyant but the energy was so heavy and thick. I was there in the hotel room trying to be invisible, not doing a good job because the first thing he did was he started screaming at me and then he apologised. “We didn’t know what was going to happen. We didn’t know if he’d get arrested. We didn’t know if he would be shot when he got to the airport. All we knew was that this was a man who was guided by his convictions, who could not be dissuaded, who was going back come hell or high water into the lion’s den. And all I could do was film.” Navalny was greeted by supporters in Moscow but quickly detained. After a year in jail, he was sentenced last month to nine more years for fraud in a case that the US state department condemned as a “sham ruling”. Defiant as ever, Navalny tweeted: “9 years. Well, as the characters of my favorite TV series The Wire’ used to say: You only do two days. That’s the day you go in and the day you come out.’” He has also urged protests against the war in Ukraine and this week suggested that a man killed in a Ukrainian village, Ilya Ivanovich Navalny, may have been targeted for his last name by the Russian military. Roher says: “I know that Alexei reads all the press for the film so, while I don’t have direct communication with him, I like to talk to him through interviews. So I’ll just give him a little shout-out and let him know that we’re thinking about him and I hope he’s doing well. We’d have a lot of fun if he were here on our film tour.” In a crackdown on opposition activists and independent journalists, Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation was last year labeled an extremist organisation by the Kremlin. It is now operating outside Russia but continues to investigate government corruption. As his war goes badly, Putin is crushing dissent with new zeal. The film ends as it began, with Roher asking Navalny what message he would leave behind for the Russian people if he is killed. The message is simple: never give up. Though they are now thousands of miles apart, Roher has no doubt that Navalny still wants to be the first democratically elected president of what he calls “the beautiful Russia of the future”. “I just hope that Alexei is able to stay alive, that the public attention that the film is receiving will dissuade the authorities from murdering him in prison. I hope that he has the ability to one day get out and walk his daughter down the aisle and live his life and, if he decides to run for the presidency again, to run for the presidency again. But it’s all of course built on him surviving this horrible moment of his life.” Navalny premieres on CNN and CNN+ on Sunday at 9pm and is shown in the UK on BBC Two on Monday at 9pm",Arts/Film,‘All I could do was film’: the making of a shocking movie on Alexei Navalny,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/23/alexei-navalny-documentary-film
4/23/2022,"According to one leading British media executive, only a deluded person would launch a new television news channel in the UK. The enormous costs of creating an outlet from scratch meant it was “not commercially viable” – and the future instead lay in streaming services rather than traditional live broadcast channels. That person was Rebekah Brooks, the boss of Rupert Murdoch’s News UK, speaking in April 2021 as she abandoned her company’s broadcast television plans. Exactly a year later, after a rapid volte-face, she is overseeing next week’s launch of talkTV, a new national channel fronted by Piers Morgan that could define her time in charge of the company. Early on Tuesday morning Brooks will receive the first ratings which will reveal whether the gamble of building a national outlet around Morgan’s culture war rants has paid off. The first episode of Piers Morgan Uncensored – featuring an interview with former US president Donald Trump – has already attracted global coverage, with Morgan delighting in a confected row about deceptive editing of a promotional clip. Other big-name guests are promised, aided by the channel’s willingness – unlike most other British news programmes – to offer large appearance fees to secure in-demand guests. Staff talk of £20,000 a week being available to persuade big names to appear, although a spokesperson insisted there was no fixed sum – and Trump was not paid to appear. The first edition of the show is nailed on to beat other British news channels, which struggle to get a few hundred thousand viewers in the same 8pm time slot – but whether this can be maintained for weeks is less clear. Despite the budget Caitlyn Jenner, who was due to appear on the show to discuss another favoured topic of the presenter, transgender rights, has already pulled out. The confluence of events that led to talkTV coming into existence involve the pandemic, Meghan Markle and GB News. The founders of the UK’s other rightwing television channel originally tried to get Murdoch involved in their project, only for him to turn them down. Kelvin MacKenzie, the former editor of the Sun and mentor to both Brooks and Morgan, said Murdoch had always been reluctant to partner with outsiders. “He said to me once, ‘never share’.” Yet the coronavirus lockdown meant Murdoch spent an unusual amount of time in the UK at his Oxfordshire mansion, accompanied by his wife, Jerry Hall. This allowed him to watch with delight as GB News crashed on launch last summer – and observe the media circus as Morgan quit ITV’s Good Morning Britain after refusing to apologise for comments about Markle’s mental health. Within months, the abandoned News UK TV project was rebooted around Morgan, with the presenter signed to a three-year deal worth up to £50m with the cost spread across almost every arm of Murdoch’s empire. As a result the channel that will launch on Monday is a modern media Frankenstein’s monster, created by bolting an existing radio station together with three hours of new television programming. Most of the TV station’s output will consist of video broadcasts of the existing talkRadio station, which has built up a small but loyal audience of 540,000 weekly listeners. The evening schedule consists of Morgan’s flagship 8pm show, sandwiched between a warm-up political debate hosted by former Sun political editor Tom Newton Dunn and a celebrity panel show similar to Loose Women, hosted by Sharon Osbourne. MacKenzie, who picked up his phone while pouring concrete down rabbit holes in his garden, predicted that Morgan’s show “will work 101%” as long as he stuck to bashing woke policies and stayed away from political news. He said political discussion was a turn-off for most viewers, suggesting the 7pm show hosted by Newton Dunn faced difficulties: “I don’t think he’s got a prayer. GB News have shown how difficult it is to attract an audience with politics. It’s just an impossible thing.” Insiders at talkTV describe a rigorous rehearsal process, overseen by staff hired from Morgan’s Good Morning Britain team and aided by the hundred-plus employees who have been recruited to work on the project. A key issue has been ensuring it does not endure the disastrous technical issues that reduced GB News to a laughing stock on launch. Several new staffers privately said they were amazed by the money on offer, while other prominent TV faces used talkTV’s interest to boost their salaries. Not everything went to plan. A daily comedy show, pencilled in for a 10pm slot, has not made it to launch despite endless piloting. Sources said the likes of Johnny Vaughan, Jeremy Kyle and former Sunday Times journalist Grant Tucker had been trialled as hosts of the show – but despite hiring staff specifically to work on it, it is not considered ready for launch. The influence of Fox News – which will carry Morgan’s show in the US on its Fox Nation streaming service – is not mentioned in promotional material. However, it is present behind the scenes, with management telling staff “friends from Fox” have helped talkTV with everything from set design to ideas for putting news packages together. Journalists at the Times have also been uneasy about being implored to appear as guests on a channel many fear could be downmarket. One of the challenges for News UK could be whether the company’s tabloid rivals are willing to give Morgan the publicity he needs to make his act work. Until recently Morgan was a core part of MailOnline’s offering, with his every utterance being written up as breaking news on one of the world’s biggest celebrity news sites. Yet when the row with Trump went public on Thursday, MailOnline published a single critical story about Morgan halfway down its homepage beneath a promotional article about electric toothbrushes. News UK declined to provide anyone for interview for this story while Morgan, who uses his 8 million followers on Twitter to pick headline-generating fights, responded to the suggestion of an interview by saying the Guardian was guilty of cancel culture.",News/Media,Rebekah Brooks pinning hopes for talkTV on Piers Morgan show,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/23/rebekah-brooks-pinning-hopes-for-talktv-on-piers-morgan-show
4/23/2022,"As Florida Republicans gave final approval to new congressional districts on Thursday, Black lawmakers staged a sit-in on the floor of the legislature, praying, chanting and singing that Black voters were under attack in the state. The extraordinary moment served as a remarkable endpoint to a brazen attack by the Republican governor, Ron DeSantis. Earlier this month, in an unprecedented move, Republicans in the legislature took the unusual step of allowing DeSantis to take the lead on drawing new congressional districts. The governor’s plan went out of its way to reduce from four to two the number of districts where Black candidates can elect the candidate of their choosing. The plan significantly distorts the map in favor of Republicans, giving them a hold on 20 of 28 congressional seats in a state Donald Trump won in 2020 with 51.2% of the vote. According to FiveThirtyEight, the Florida map is nearly tied with Texas as the most biased in the US. DeSantis got his map after rejecting less biased but still GOP-friendly maps proposed by the legislature. The fact the legislature ceded its power to DeSantis only underscores how the governor, considered a potential presidential candidate in 2024, controls Florida politics. “For all intents and purposes, there’s currently, in Florida, one-man rule,” said Mac Stipanovich, a longtime Republican strategist who is now retired. “Democracy in Florida is not functioning. It’s not gone, the structure is there, the possibility of a return to representative government with checks and balances remains. But it’s not currently functioning.” DeSantis’s plan does not make a serious effort to comply with legal protections for minority voters. An amendment in the Florida constitution, overwhelmingly approved in 2010, makes it illegal to draw a district that diminishes the ability of a minority to elect the candidate of their choosing. DeSantis nonetheless eliminated two districts that allow Black voters to do so. The governor has openly talked about his desire to get rid of the fifth congressional district, which is 46% Black and stretches from Jacksonville to Tallahassee. The governor has said the district, currently represented by a Black Democrat, is an illegal racial gerrymander because it was drawn to preserve the ability of Black voters to elect the candidate of their choice. DeSantis’s plan chops the district into four Republican districts where Black voters would comprise a much smaller share of the population. DeSantis’s plan appears to have “all the hallmarks of intentional discrimination”, said Stuart Naifeh, an attorney at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund who works on redistricting cases. “He wants to dismantle a Democratic district. And in this case a Democratic district that’s been held by a Black person for a long time. And it’s a majority-minority district, so it’s concerning that he is diluting minority voting strength with the pretext being that he’s got constitutional concerns about it.” The protest started on Thursday after Yvonne Hinson, a Democrat from Gainesville, was speaking about her work during the civil rights era only to have her mic cut off when her time expired. “I’ve been kicked. I’ve been talked about and I have been called names you don’t even put in the dictionary any more,” she said. “The Voting Rights Act of 1965, I fought for that. I’ve met Martin Luther King, I don’t just talk about him. He taught me peaceful protests, and here we are in 2022, rolling back the tide.” Two Black lawmakers, Tray McCurdy of Orlando and Angie Nixon of Jacksonville, wore T-shirts that said “Stop the Black attack” as they protested on the House floor. “What we have here is a group of people who are worried and concerned and scared about the browning, about the darkening of our country and they are trying to hold on to power so much that they are changing the rules,” Nixon told reporters. Republicans waved the rules to skip debate and pass all bills including the petty attack on Disney & unconstitutional Congressional maps that erase black access seats.This is not democracy — this is one party rule drunk on power and bullying anyone in their way into submission. https://t.co/IZ6ASmtN88 DeSantis and his attorneys have shown little concern for precedent but made it clear they are betting federal and state courts will agree with their interpretation of the law. The US supreme court has long said lawmakers can consider race in redistricting if they have justification, as long as it’s not the predominant factor, said Michael Li, a redistricting expert at the Brennan Center for Justice. The supreme court’s conservative majority has recently signaled, however, that it is very skeptical of the use of race in redistricting. “They’re trying to see what they can get away with,” said Stuart Naifeh, of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. “Speaking from the view of what the courts have done more recently, they may get away with it.” DeSantis appears eager to attack the anti-gerrymandering language Florida voters added to the state constitution. In addition to outlawing discriminatory gerrymandering based on race, the language also bans partisan gerrymandering. “I think our dispute very well may lead to saying that Florida’s redistricting amendments are not consistent with the 14th amendment’s equal protection clause,” the governor said in March. “It’s a dismantling of our rule of law,” said Cecile Scoon, president of the Florida chapter of the League of Women Voters, which filed a lawsuit challenging the maps on Friday. “If each one of us simply said, ‘I don’t agree, I’m gonna do exactly the opposite of that law,’ I don’t know how we can manage a government and manage change in a lawful way which is what Americans are known for.”",News/US news,‘Democracy in Florida is not functioning.’ Governor’s rigged maps rob Black voters of power ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/23/new-florida-electoral-map-ron-desantis-black-voters-republicans
