3/19/2022,"On the day I talk over Zoom with NoViolet Bulawayo in Zimbabwe, she is relying on a generator to power her internet connection; when she has a tickle in her throat and excuses herself to fetch water, she returns laughing, having forgotten that there is none today, and relieved that her sister has furnished her with a bottle. Ahead of travelling to the US for the publication of her second novel, Glory, she is in Bulawayo, the home city that provides half of her pen name; the other half, NoViolet, links the Ndebele word for “with” to the name of her mother, who died when her daughter was 18 months old. It was an early loss that, she says, means her writing will always have a strong awareness of how personal lives intersect with larger historical and political forces. “Some of these things that we carry, we don’t sign up for. But we’re here and, you know, everything and anything can happen to us. It’s part of my story. But it also doesn’t define me or define who I am and where I’m going.” Born Elizabeth Zandile Tshele in 1981, the year after Southern Rhodesia became Zimbabwe and Robert Mugabe its first prime minister, Bulawayo has used her work to explore the importance of naming as an act of self-possession, so much so that her debut novel was entitled We Need New Names. She herself, she once said on stage, grew up with many names, and didn’t know she was called Elizabeth until her first day at school. We Need New Names, published in 2013, was shortlisted for the Booker prize, making Bulawayo the first Black African woman and the first Zimbabwean to feature in the final six. Earlier, what became its opening chapter had won the Caine prize for African writing under the title Hitting Budapest, a reference to the nickname given to a wealthy area by the group of hungry children who go there, from the shantytown called Paradise, to steal guavas. The novel moved from Zimbabwe to its protagonist’s new home in the American midwest, a geographical and cultural journey mirrored by its author, who studied in Michigan and Texas before earning a master’s at Cornell University and being awarded the Truman Capote Fellowship, both in creative writing. Having left Zimbabwe at 18, to join an aunt, it would be 13 years before she visited her home country again, due to her studies and the instability in the country. In previous interviews, she has talked about the beginning of her life in the US as a time of silence, where previously she had been a noisy, gregarious child. Bulawayo went on to teach at Stanford and elsewhere, but 2017 provided her with an exceptional and pressing reason to return to the country of her birth: the end of Mugabe’s rule, following a coup d’etat that ended with his former deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, being installed in his place. “Because it was so momentous, I knew right from the start that there was a story there,” she remembers. Initially, she planned to write nonfiction, before realising that, by the time she had assembled her material, “everything worth saying would have been said”. When the tumultuous and violent elections of 2018 came round, she knew she needed a different approach. “Spending time on the ground, just witnessing people’s hopes and dreams and fears and optimism, and very crucially witnessing that fall apart with the outcome of the elections, made me realise that, OK, this book was not even about Mugabe, really; it needed to be about the common people, the ordinary people and their stories.” Even then, the project was to undergo another more radical shift. Bulawayo would wake in the morning, turn on the news, and see that reality was moving more quickly than she could hope to take account of; every new development would complicate or render obsolete a plot line or character. At the same time, she says, Zimbabweans were making frequent use of George Orwell’s Animal Farm to discuss the political situation. Blending that with her memories of her grandmother’s animal-led stories, she decided to forsake the human world entirely. The result is a novel that opens with the citizens of the imaginary Jidada gathering in sweltering heat to celebrate Independence Day under the eye of the Old Horse and his wife, Marvellous the Donkey, their security assured by a retinue of Chosen Ones and a ferocious pack of dogs, the Defenders. The Old Horse, now reaching the end of his powers, imagines that the animals will stay loyal for ever, but bargains without their swelling discontent: “But the Father of the Nation didn’t know us either, didn’t know that what was happening to him was actually the best thing to ever happen to us. That after the last election he’d in fact rigged, following the previous one he’d also rigged like the other ones before that he’d stolen – yes, after he and his regime had frustrated all the proper and possible ways at our disposal to remove him in a peaceful and constitutional manner, we’d been left with no choice but to Fbecome the kinds of animals to welcome his demise and welcome his demise whichever way it came.” Bulawayo spent a year in Zimbabwe and another in South Africa, and then, after six months back in the US, she returned home, where she continued to experience the reality of daily life for Zimbabweans: hours spent queueing for fuel or at the bank to withdraw money, frequent disruptions to utilities and limited access to medical care. How did it feel after the surge of hopefulness that followed Mugabe’s deposition? How quickly did that feeling, which she describes as a turning point after decades of stasis, begin to fade? “I think it became apparent very, very quickly,” she replies, citing the 2018 election as the moment at which those who had been prepared to grant the new administration the leeway to create a new start “realised that, OK, we were still in trouble, nothing had changed”. I ask her how she felt at the time, and feels now, about the reaction of the international community. “I mean, at some point, if you come from a place like Zimbabwe, and you live the life that some of us have lived, you come to appreciate that you are really on your own; that the world does not – I don’t want to say does not really care – but doesn’t seem to know what to do with our situation. So if anything, it wasn’t disappointment in the international community, it was just a feeling of, OK, we are back to square one, and there is no way out of it.” But that sense of isolation doesn’t have to lead to insularity. There’s an extraordinary, electrifying moment in Glory when a group of animals, waiting for the results of what is ironically called the #freefairncredible election, are galvanised by news from afar, and gather round a phone to watch footage of a brutal murder carried out by officers of the law in another country: “We see them talking, the murdered Black body at their feet like a reaped harvest, like a big black bundle of nothing.” The page resolves into the repetition of a single phrase: “I can’t breathe.” The murder of George Floyd and the global protests that followed it prompted Bulawayo to reflect on the links between abuses of power across countries and societies, and on her own responsibility as a writer. “This is a point in my work where I have to pause and consider how I position myself in relation to the world, and what is happening; to push my art to do more, to be engaged, and to continue to be in solidarity with struggles for all kinds of freedom everywhere.” She is appreciative of the part that social media has played in allowing those engaged in such struggles to connect with one another, and in the way that it has democratised the news and reportage, providing multiple perspectives and voices. But she notes the importance of continuing to participate and engage once one has logged off, and of remembering that “some of the people engaged in these movements do not always have access to the internet, depending on where they are. It’s easy for the few of us who have the privilege of connectivity to actually think, ah, this is normal. This is the real world. But the reality is that a big chunk of these battles are fought quietly outside of the spotlight of social media, that there are important names that will never trend, and that there are generations of freedom fighters who have been doing this work without the internet, without being spotlighted.” We talk about how this relates to issues around feminism, and how the proliferation of platforms for sharing experiences and priorities can challenge a dominant western narrative, one that sees women beyond it as victims of oppression in need of salvation. “Western women are also going through their own stuff,” she remarks. “And the thing is to find the solidarities. I think there’s so much to be gained from a truly connected movement, an intersectional movement, women connecting across borders, across time, across all kinds of divisions that are really artificial.” I wonder how those artificial dividing lines fit into her own experience of living in the US for such a long time. The seismic events of the last few years there, she says, felt disheartening in the sense that they reminded her how “what happens in one part of the world can easily happen even to those other parts that think they are better because they have this democracy thing figured out”. But she remains committed to retaining her dual identity. “I fiercely love both countries. It took me a while to own America as home, because it’s a complicated business. I’m an immigrant, I’m not from there. There is a way in which the country, especially during the Trump years – and really before, but it was certainly amplified then – can remind you of your otherness, of your foreignness. And that can certainly create a tension in how you see yourself in terms of belonging. But the reality is that I’ve lived in both countries for more or less equal years now. I’ve made my life in both countries, and my life continues to be in both countries. So, it is no longer an option to be detached from one place or the other, no matter how maddening they can be.” Glory is dedicated to “all Jidadas, everywhere”, and it is undeniably a powerful celebration of the strength of a united citizenry, of a moment when those living under tyranny decide that they have had enough – a sentiment that has particular force as we speak, in the immediate aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But it’s also impossible to read it without an awareness of Zimbabwe’s post-Mugabe challenges and, indeed, it is a novel filled with pain and loss. What does Bulawayo feel the future looks like from the present moment? She considers carefully. “As a writer and as a Zimbabwean, there is a feeling of despair, in the sense that nothing is working,” she says. “I know that’s a totalising way of framing it, but the reality is that the future is not encouraging. And understandably, because those who are in charge of the country are inefficient, they are inept, they are corrupt, they do not care about the lives of ordinary Zimbabweans. And, given what just happened in the last election, it doesn’t seem like it’s going to be easy to remedy the situation. That’s where the despair comes from. That said, it is always important to hope, to be optimistic. I am encouraged by this new generation that wants better, and I think that’s really going to be an important component of us figuring out the way forward, because for you to go somewhere you have to want better.” And what will she be up to? She smiles. “What I’m doing next is a whole bunch of relaxing. I’ve been writing since 2017. And this book drained me. I think it’s one of the hardest things I’ve ever done.” And, mindful of the drain not only on her but on her generator, we say goodbye.

3/19/2022,"Interest rates went up again this week, leaving those planning to stash some money in a cash Isa facing a choice. If they want a (slightly) better interest rate – up to 1.9% at the time of writing – a fixed-rate Isa may be the way to go. However, these involve tying up your cash at a set rate, often for several years, which might feel like an odd thing to do in the current uncertain climate, and when interest rates are marching upwards. Easy-access Isas give you more flexibility and, in theory at least, might benefit from any savings rates increases that banks deign to pass on, but the rates right now are lower: the highest this week were around the 0.8% mark. Nevertheless, one of the most popular deals is likely to be the easy-access cash Isa from Marcus, the Goldman Sachs online banking brand, which was this week paying a variable 0.7% (this includes 0.1% interest bonus fixed for the first 12 months). You haven’t got long to make use of your 2021-22 Isa allowance. These accounts let you protect the returns on your savings from tax. There are several types, although the two main ones are the cash Isa and the stocks and shares Isa. During the current tax year you can save up to £20,000 in one type, or across two or more. You have until midnight on 5 April each year to add money, and the allowance each year does not carry over. Some experts argue that the introduction in 2016 of the personal savings allowance means there is not much point in having a cash Isa. This allowance means basic-rate taxpayers can receive £1,000 of interest each year without paying any tax, while higher-rate taxpayers can receive up to £500. But Isas still have their supporters, who say people should make use of the existing rules while they can. Some savers like the discipline of choosing an Isa each year. Also, you can transfer money from a cash Isa to a stocks and shares one without using up any fresh allowance. That gives you the option in the future of channelling your nest-egg cash into the stock market. As to the choice between a fixed-rate or a variable-rate one (easy-access Isas typically offer a variable rate), Rachel Springall at the financial data provider Moneyfacts admits: “It’s a tricky one.” Remember, you can often get a higher interest rate if you go for an account that isn’t an Isa. Effectively, you are paying a small premium for the long-term tax benefits. For example, at the time of writing, the best-paying easy-access non-Isa savings account, from Virgin Money, was offering 1%. Meanwhile, the top-paying equivalent cash Isas included Internet Saver Isa Plus Issue 10 from Yorkshire building society, paying between 0.6% and 0.82% depending on the account balance, and Melton building society’s Easy Access Isa paying 0.8% (this account is currently restricted to customers living in Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire or Rutland or people who have been society members for five years or more). It’s a similar story with fixed-rate bonds versus fixed-rate Isas: earlier this week you could get a one-year fixed-rate bond from Al Rayan Bank paying an expected 1.61%, but the best you could get from a one-year fixed-rate Isa was 1.21% from Castle Trust Bank. Meanwhile, Shawbrook Bank was offering an 18-month fixed-rate Isa paying 1.35%. However, with everything that’s going on at the moment, a lot of people won’t want to tie up their money even for a year. “The way the market has moved over the years is that there are a lot more challenger banks outside the Isa market,” says Springall. A halfway house between an easy-access Isa and a fixed-rate one is a notice Isa. With these, you must give a period of notice – typically between 30 and 180 days – before you are able to withdraw your funds. It means you are not locked in for a year or more. But the current rates on offer may not be tempting enough for some. One possible argument in favour of a fixed rate is that while the Bank of England base rate has gone up three times during the past 12 months, climbing from 0.1% to 0.75%, most variable-rate savings accounts have either had only part of this passed on, or none of it. If, over the years, you have accumulated a number of cash Isa accounts with various banks and building societies, now’s the time to check what rates you are getting. If they are particularly bad, consider moving to another provider. Some people also argue that it’s easier to keep tabs on your cash if you consolidate several Isas into one account. You can transfer your Isa(s) from one financial firm to another at any time and, if you want, move your savings from a cash Isa to a stocks and shares Isa, and vice versa. When it comes to money invested in previous years, you can choose to transfer all or just part of your savings. But if you transfer an Isa you have paid into during the current tax year to a new provider, you must move the whole balance. To switch, contact the Isa provider you want to move to and fill out a transfer form. (If you withdraw the money without doing this, your savings could lose their tax-free status.) However, you need to make sure the account you’d like to switch to accepts “transfers in” of existing Isa cash. Not all do: some are open only to new money. For example, the Marcus cash Isa doesn’t allow transfers in. “Most of the good rates do accept transfers in,” says Springall.",Lifestyle/Money,Isas: is fixed rate or easy access better as interest rates rise?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/19/isas-fixed-rate-easy-access-better-interest-rates-rise
3/19/2022,"The landscapes in Davide Monteleone’s images of China’s belt and road initiative are very familiar to me. We can see desert, uninhabited wasteland and views along the Yangtze River and in north-west China. There are also photographs showing the characters “Stay strong, Wuhan!” on skyscrapers in neon lights. They are reminiscent of images I took in China, which captured dilapidated cities before they were rebuilt; energy plants; the development of impoverished areas and large-scale architecture. At that time, I wanted to write a new encyclopedia to elucidate new concepts and thoughts that emerge with rapid urbanisation, and to form a new language. The project was too ambitious, and I did not complete it. It was my failed “belt and road”. ‘Stay strong, Wuhan!’ The Chinese city of Heihe seen from Blagoveschensk, Russia, across the frozen Amur River, February 2020 The initiative, which has been likened to the Silk Road trade routes of imperial China, was proposed by the current Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, as a blueprint to reposition China in the era of globalisation, and to change the world order in a Chinese way. The thinking behind this $1tn project is ambitious. Such long-term planning, coherent political goals and effective implementation are rare, both in Chinese and in human history. The ruling party in China has laid bare its determination to occupy an important role in the world. Local people at work on the Great Renaissance dam, Ethiopia, September 2019. The mammoth project, which began on the Blue Nile in 2011, is one of the largest hydroelectric power plants in the world. China has contributed about $1.8bn of the $4.8bn total cost The Tecno Mobile factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, September 2019. The Chinese phone manufacturer stopped doing business in Asia in 2008 to focus on the African market. It is now the second biggest supplier of smartphones on the continent The goals of the belt and road initiative are pragmatic, unlike those proposed by the Chinese Communist party in their early days, and embodied in slogans such as “Exceeding the UK, Catching the US” in the 50s and 60s. China, with a huge amount of accumulated wealth and managerial and production experience, has understood that it can fill the gaps in parts of the world that are forgotten and abandoned by the west. These regions thirst for a strong economic entity to piece together fragmented, disorganised territories with longstanding historical differences. This is where China comes in. About 145 nations have joined the belt and road initiative by signing a memorandum of understanding with China, including countries in Europe, south-east Asia and the Middle East. It is an initiative that mainly focuses on basic infrastructure and engineering projects, such as transportation through rail, road and ports, to facilitate global trade and offer solutions to the problems of developing countries – as the Chinese saying goes, “If you want to be rich, build roads first.” Many people in China, and also in the developing world, feel optimistic about this initiative, and mock Europe and the US for failing to match its vision. Aktau, Kazakhstan, October 2017. The city’s port offers access to the Caspian Sea; from 2016 to 2020, trade between China and the Caucasus region almost doubled A monument in Nurkent, Kazakhstan, October 2017. The newly built town will accommodate 100,000 workers serving the nearby Khorgos dry port. A Chinese logistics company has 49% ownership of the land The belt and road was not a decision taken on a whim. The idea comes from an article by Mao Zedong titled “People of the world, unite and defeat the US aggressors and all their lackeys”, published in 1970 and commonly known as the “520 statement”. In this article, Mao prompted the developing world to be united and fight against western political power led by the US. He stressed the importance of nationalist revolutions, independence and liberation movements as the wave of unstoppable historical change. Mao quoted the Confucian philosopher Mencius – “a just cause attracts much support, an unjust one finds little” – to illustrate his belief that people in the world would triumph over Anglo-American imperialism. When my generation was growing up, these thoughts permeated the entire country. I belong to the same generation as Xi. We were encouraged to “have the entire motherland in mind and the whole world in view” and to start revolutions everywhere in the world. These arrogant ideas relate to the ideology of that era. Based on these thoughts, the belt and road initiative is a strategic move that corresponds to the country’s rapid development. The question is: will its goals be achieved in a world that is much more complicated than it once was? Sihanoukville, Cambodia, December 2019. The once quiet tourist town on the coast has been transformed, its skyline dominated by casinos built to accommodate those seeking to avoid the ban on gambling in mainland China. More than 90% of businesses are Chinese-owned and locals complain the newcomers are turning the city into a de facto colony, forcing up rents and making them second-class citizens in their homeland Monteleone’s photographs are broad in scope and encompass many stories and strange landscapes. The Italian photographer began his project in Russia in 2014 before visiting vast rail and road projects across Asia; container ports; factories; casinos; and the Grand Renaissance dam in Ethiopia. The images clearly depict China’s strategic ambitions, very different from the original Silk Road, which operated from around 130BC until the mid-15th century. The Silk Road was a network of trade routes, whereas the belt and road initiative embeds a political ambition beyond commerce. The issue in question here is: who will be the centre of the world? Who will rise to world power? A copy of Moscow’s St Basil’s Cathedral in Manzhouli, China, August 2015. The small city on the Russian border is one of China’s biggest trade hubs. The Ukrainian crisis has given fresh impetus to Chinese efforts to forge a closer relationship between the two nations, as Russia faces sanctions from the west From my perspective, China refuses to waver in its policies, no matter what setbacks it encounters. The belt and road initiative is its counterattack in a global game of chess. The democracies of Europe and the US are very different from China.

The corporatocratic west, primarily measuring political success according to economic profitability, has lost its vision of pursuing mutual benefit and the wellbeing of humankind. This, however, is not to say that China is necessarily bringing real benefits to the developing world. The belt and road initiative, launched to benefit China, is tinted with colonialism. It leads this ancient country of 1.4 billion people to a swamp of pragmatism and egoism.

3/19/2022,"Soaring energy prices are helping to create a cost-of-living crisis, with the average family’s energy bill rising by 54%. The energy price cap has been raised to £1,971 and a further increase is expected later this year, which would take the average household bill to about £2,300. The government has responded by offering a one-off £200 discount on bills from October, to be paid back over five years. The UK is not alone: energy prices are rising around the world as industries struck by Covid-19 lockdowns resume operations, and energy supplies still need to ramp up after plunging two years ago during the first lockdowns. The war in Ukraine is adding to the problem: Vladimir Putin has used his dominance over EU energy supplies (Russia supplies 40% of Europe’s gas, and 60% of Germany’s) as a weapon of war, and turned down the gas taps by a quarter before the invasion. Putin could tighten supplies still further, and in any case the EU wants to move away from Russian fossil fuels to stem the flow of money to the Kremlin war machine – Europe has paid more than €15bn (£12.6bn) for Russian gas, oil and coal since the invasion began. The UK relies less on Russian fuel, which makes up only 3% of UK gas supplies and about 8% of oil, but British consumers will be hit anyway as the price of gas is set by international markets that are badly affected by the war. Now the government is publishing a strategy to secure the UK’s energy supplies and try to dampen soaring costs for consumers and industry. Renewable energy will play a significant role, with the government planning to rapidly increase the goal for offshore wind generation, and relax the planning rules that have prevented onshore windfarms being built in England for most of the last decade. Nuclear power will get a boost, with the government seeking to help investors expand the UK’s reactor fleet. Keeping the UK’s existing nuclear power stations open as long as possible will help provide stability through the current crisis and beyond, but any new reactors are likely to take more than a decade to start producing power. Fossil fuels will also be a big focus for the strategy, with the government seeking to expand the UK’s supplies of gas and oil, pumping more from the North Sea and making overtures to big Middle Eastern suppliers such as Saudi Arabia. New licences for the North Sea, already under way, will be brought forward. The government is leaving the door open to fracking, saying that it could be allowed if health and safety conditions are met, but few in Whitehall see any real future for fracking in the UK. Fracking at scale would require the industrialisation of swathes of the UK’s landscape, would face huge local opposition, would be expensive and would take years to produce any gas. It is not a solution to the current crisis and the carbon dioxide emissions it would generate make it unsuitable for any future crisis. Coal, the dirtiest form of electricity generation, is to be phased out in the UK by 2024. But the government is understood to have made informal contacts to the UK’s remaining coal operators – EDF, Uniper and Drax, which has converted its boilers to biomass but could feasibly return to coal – as a contingency. Whitehall sources claim this is only a question of sensibly keeping options open in case of deepening crisis, rather than overtures to a coal renaissance. A windfall tax on fossil fuel companies. Such a tax would have serious backing – the International Energy Agency, regarded as the gold standard on energy policy advice and not known for its radicalism, has advocated a windfall tax in the EU, with the proceeds to be used to ease energy bills for vulnerable people. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have also called for one in the UK. Unfreezing the fuel duty escalator would raise billions that could be recycled to the poorest. Petrol taxes have been kept steady since 2010, resulting in an £11bn loss to the Treasury in 2019, and fuel-guzzling SUVs now make up about half of new cars bought. Making public transport free would be a radical move to get people out of cars overnight, and slash petrol and diesel demand while leading to clearer skies, less air pollution and safer roads for walking and cycling. And a nationwide push to insulate every home to decent standards, and install heat pumps in place of gas boilers, would slash the UK’s energy bills and end the need to import fossil fuels from this year if pursued at speed. But these measures have been ruled out by the Treasury and other departments. Party time. They are enjoying a bonanza, with BP’s chief boasting his company was a “cash machine”, and his finance chief that he has “more money than we know what to do with”. Dangerously for the Earth’s climate, they are using this to cement their lobbying power, telling governments they should invest in expanding oil, gas and even coal. But an increasing number of political leaders are seeing the war in Ukraine as a sign that clean, domestically produced renewable energy can bolster national security. The government is expected to reaffirm its commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, despite agitation from a small number of rightwing Tory backbenchers and Nigel Farage. Boris Johnson is said to be a personal champion of green issues within the cabinet, and Michael Gove, the secretary for levelling up, spoke out strongly in favour of net zero this week. No, the prices of food, clothing and other goods are also rising. Inflation is affecting many countries as economies recover from the Covid-19 recession, and the war in Ukraine has added to pressures, particularly over food as Ukraine and Russia are leading grain and oil exporters. But another factor unique to the UK that is raising prices is Brexit, as imports and exports now face extra costs, paperwork, staff shortages and other barriers. But don’t expect this government to admit that.",News/Environment,A guide to the UK energy security strategy,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/19/a-guide-to-the-uk-energy-security-strategy-cost-of-living-crisis
3/19/2022,"Liverpool are going for the quadruple, while Manchester City’s horizons have narrowed to a mere treble and Pep Guardiola will be hoping for third time lucky in this FA Cup quarter-final at St Mary’s as his side’s league meetings with Southampton this season have both ended in draws. Saints had been in excellent form but a trouncing at the hands of Aston Villa appears to have dented their confidence as two more losses swiftly followed. City also have stalled, in comparison to their usual imperious best, after failing to score in successive matches. A match away from the pressures of the title race could be all they need to ratchet back into top gear though but Southampton could see it as an all-or-nothing affair, too. A Cup classic in the making, hopefully.
