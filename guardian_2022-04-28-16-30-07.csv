4/28/2022,"It is little over half a century since homosexuality was partially decriminalised in England and Wales, and it’s a period defined by both progress and trauma. When Lord Arran co-sponsored the bill that ended the total criminalisation of same-sex relations between men – after his gay brother had killed himself – his preamble was bleak. “Lest the opponents of the new bill think that a new freedom, a new privileged class has been created,” he declared. “Let me remind them that no amount of legislation will prevent homosexuals from being the subject of dislike and derision, or at best of pity,” After the Sexual Offences Act was passed in 1967, convictions of gay men for gross indecency actually increased, and gay people were still characterised as would-be sexual predators and threats to children. The 1980s HIV/Aids pandemic, ravaged a generation of gay and bisexual men, attitudes towards gay people hardened and a moral panic culminated in the passing of section 28, banning the “promotion” of homosexuality in schools: the first anti-gay legislation passed since 1885. Nevertheless, in this period LGBTQ+ people flourished culturally and artistically, while from the 90s onwards, hostile public attitudes crumbled precipitously as anti-gay laws were struck from statute books. Yet as a reminder that progress is far from linear, Britain is in the grip of another moral panic, this time directed at transgender people. And while today’s LGBTQ+ communities are more united in defiance of government policy that any time since section 28 (more than 80 organisations pulled out of a government conference over its refusal to ban trans conversion “therapy”), Stonewall, the country’s main LGBTQ+ civil rights organisation, finds itself under siege, while homophobic and transphobic hate crimes are surging. So this really is an opportune moment to launch what is, astonishingly, Britain’s first ever national LGBTQ+ museum, established by the charity Queer Britain. Opening its doors to the public on 5 May, the space is ideally situated in King’s Cross, both for Londoners and for those visiting the capital by rail. Its opening is an important milestone for a minority that has only enjoyed widespread public acceptance and significant legal protections for the briefest of periods, and is, in a sense, still blinking, slightly dazed, in the light. Launching a museum is an ambitious endeavour, and Queer Britain has come together with impressive speed. In 2017, its director Joseph Galliano visited the Queer British Art exhibition at Tate Britain and “realised you could create a blockbuster exhibition around queer subjects”. As a former editor of Gay Times, he tapped into his extensive connections with LGBTQ+ organisations and queer activists and artists, and when he spoke to potential funders, Galliano met constant astonishment that such a museum did not already exist or even been attempted in its own right before. Relationships were quickly built with the culture sector – such as the Tate and National Trust – as well as partnerships with the likes of M&C Saatchi “to help us develop our strategic outlook”. Thanks to the efforts of its patron ambassador Carolyn Ward donations began to pour in. Far from the national national lockdowns proving an obstacle, the inevitable shift to digital events helped: it was easier to get 500 people on a Zoom call than crammed into a room. “Our donors stood by us,” says Gallianio, while a membership system allowed for people to contribute what they could afford: whether it be a pound or £100 a month. “You see people welling up as you’re talking about the museum and the vision of the museum,” he says with no little pride. “When I started seeing that happen, that was the moment that made me step back and think: OK, this is something I’ve got to really commit to making happen and commit to making it as ambitious as possible.” One of the key tests of this museum is representation: LGBTQ+ spaces remain dominated by white, middle-class cis men (guilty as charged!). The trustees and advisory board reflect a laudable attempt to counter that with an impressive A-team of LGBTQ+ luminaries, such as the pioneering lesbian activist Lisa Power, Huddersfield-born Black artist and curator Ajamu X, Liv Little – founder of gal-dem, the magazine for women and non-binary people of colour – and the indefatigable trans author Christine Burns. As Galliano, ushers me into the museum – for now, three rooms of photographs serving as a holding pattern before its big summer exhibition in July – the commitment to that mission is commendably clear: queer families of colour, all conveying joy and love, adorn the walls. Why is this so important? Because the oppressed can be oppressors, too; research by Stonewall in 2018 found around half of Black, Asian and minority ethnic LGBTQ+ people suffered racial discrimination from local LGBTQ+ networks, rising to 61% among Black LGBTQ+ people. “We built a board to make sure that there’s proper leadership structures that are diverse in themselves, as well as bringing in more skills that we need,” says Galliano. Uplifting underrepresented sections of the community is “absolutely written into the DNA”, with its first project being an oral history collection on those groups, accompanied by focus groups with representation from LGBTQ+ people with different and often intersecting identities. “This will not be easy if we’re to truly transcend tokenism,” the trustee and Black photographer Robert Taylor tells me, “but I’m encouraged by what I’ve seen so far.” It’s so easy to be “unconsciously excluding”, he says, and he wants to “keep an eye out for comfortable unconscious assumptions about what we’re doing, how and for whom.” Or, as Lisa Power tactfully puts it: “We love our cis white men but they’re part of a bigger story.” Britain’s often tortured struggle for LGBTQ+ rights is reflected in many of the photographs, such as the flamboyantly dressed yet straight Jewish Labour MP Leo Abse, who successfully pushed for the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality from the backbenches. Maureen Colquhoun – the first openly lesbian MP who died last year – defiantly holds a placard emblazoned with “THE MPS MUST COME OUT”, while it’s difficult not to feel a pang of sadness at a photo of Justin Fashanu flexing his muscles: he was, of course, Britain’s first and still only out gay male professional footballer who killed himself in 1998. Such a collection would not be complete without that unlikeliest of LGBTQ+ allies, Diana, Princess of Wales, who helped upend the stigma of Aids, and is pictured lovingly touching the hand of an HIV patient. This is a museum with huge potential. It includes space for events which – given that, unlike other major western capitals, London lacks a permanent LGBTQ+ community space – could make it a vital hub. There are, however, problems that the museum surely needs to interrogate in advance of the summer exhibition. One photograph, for example, features a Metropolitan police officer joyfully high-fiving a London Pride attender. That same police force has been criticised as institutionally homophobic by the families of the four men murdered by Stephen Port over its failure to investigate the so-called “Grindr killer”. Is the picture really appropriate, I ask Galliano. There’s a pause which seems to last a lifetime. “I think you make a good point, which I’d like to have a more considered answer for,” he tells me. “There’s a fuck of a lot to do in getting something like this set up, and it’s a lot of spinning plates, and the thing is you get some of them wrong.” There is a lack of expression, so far, of queer love, too – of a non-familial sort, anyway – and sexuality, with the exception of a picture of the lower torsos of two kilted men holding hands. This is a family space, of course, and no one reasonable would expect full-frontal nudity, but it’s striking that the walls of a queer east London bar such as Dalston Superstore feature more challenging images about such important elements of the LGBTQ+ experience. It should be hoped, too, that the upcoming summer exhibition features more images of struggle: there are allusions, such as a Black woman holding a “LESBIAN AND GAY PRIDE ’83” balloon, but there are so many joyous moments to celebrate that are in danger of being forgotten by younger LGBTQ+ generations, such as the lesbian activists who abseiled into the House of Lords or stormed the Six O’Clock News to protest against section 28. “Wait for the summer exhibition,” says Galliano. Where I disagree with Galliano, though, is when he suggests “it’s very easy to kind of go ‘struggle, victimhood, difficulty’”: these moments should surely be seen as courageous acts of agency which spurred on change. Given the full-frontal offensive against trans people it is welcome to see representation, including two portraits of trans people from award-winning photographer Allie Crewe’s You Brought Your Own Light collection. “As a trans person myself I am always surprised that the rights won by LGBTQ+ communities to date were very much won with trans siblings in the day-to-day struggles and fights from the outset,” says trustee and businessperson Antonia Belcher, “yet that representation has not materialised the same recognition for trans people – hardly fair.” She fears the museum may not succeed in challenging entrenched attitudes among older Britons, but it will be “welcomed by younger generations, like my own children and grandchildren, who are naturally inclusive”. So who is this museum for? “It’s for everyone!” says Anjum Mouj, trustee and board member of Imaan, the Muslim LGBTQ+ group. She wants LGBTQ+ and heterosexual people alike to visit, with parents taking their queer and straight children; and for the museum to look beyond Britain’s borders, in a world in which 69 nations and territories still criminalise same-sex relationships. In its first year, the museum hopes to attract 26,000 people through its doors. It is easy to be pernickety about ambitious and well-intentioned new projects – this one has been four years in the making – but any critiques should surely be about wishing this endeavour well. It will make mistakes, but with such commendable representation among its trustees and advisers, and a genuine commitment to listen to LGBTQ+ communities, there are huge grounds for optimism. In the half-century since criminalisation of male homosexuality was partly repealed, Britain’s LGBTQ+ communities have made dramatic contributions to British culture and society, often while faced with tremendous adversity. We surely deserve our own museum to remind us how our rights were won – at huge cost and sacrifice – as well as showcasing how we have flourished. Queen Britain is at 2 Granary Square, London, N1, and will open to the public on 5 May.",Arts/Art and design,‘This is for everyone!’: inside Britain’s first ever LGBTQ+ museum,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/28/inside-queer-britain-first-lgbtq-museum
4/28/2022,"You have got to hand it to Charles de Gaulle. The electoral system he created for France’s Fifth Republic has stood the test of time. More than six decades on, this week’s re-election of De Gaulle’s latest successor, Emmanuel Macron, is a reminder that the particularities of electoral systems can set the terms of a nation’s politics more lastingly than we sometimes allow. There’s a message for Britain there too, but we will come on to that. De Gaulle’s constitution, constructed between 1958 and 1962, aimed at two goals in particular. The first was to empower De Gaulle and his successors to govern as executive presidents, embodying what the general’s biographer Julian Jackson called “a certain idea of France”. The second aim was to keep the French left, and the Communist party in particular, out of power for as long as possible. The system worked well for more than two decades, especially while the imperiously charismatic De Gaulle was still alive, before François Mitterrand deftly reshaped the left while the communists slid into history. Since Mitterrand’s era, however, both the old left and the old right have fragmented into multiple smaller parties. Yet De Gaulle’s electoral system was still robust enough this week to dispatch France’s extreme right very effectively, and for the third time since the millennium. Chapeau to the general for that. Much of the assessment of the 2022 election has been rather grudging about Macron’s victory. It has concentrated on his personal aloofness, on the economic and social problems ahead, on the decline in his majority since 2017, and on the 41.5% share achieved by Marine Le Pen in the second round. These are important things. The national assembly elections in June will be much messier. But the judgments on the presidential contest underplay both the role of the Gaullist constitution itself and of Macron’s success in mastering it, something which eluded his two predecessors, Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande. Macron’s re-election shows that De Gaulle’s system still has gas in the tank. His 28% vote in the first round on 10 April was at the upper end of the first-round scores achieved by most recent French presidential victors, though a world away from De Gaulle’s own 45% in the first round in 1965. In almost any other democracy, Macron’s 17-point margin of victory over Le Pen in the second round would be regarded as spectacular. But the results obscure what is wrong with the system. The two-round electoral mandate remains De Gaulle’s ambivalent legacy to French politics. His constitution gives presidents an authority that is both real (because it produces a clear winner) and illusory (because most people vote for someone else or don’t vote at all). The combination of that mixed mandate and executive power survives – for now. Yet it is an increasingly unstable one, especially in a country with France’s vigorous tradition of street politics. The system gives a voice to the diverse political stances characteristic of any modern democracy, while also covering them over. Electoral fragmentation is now an embedded feature of many 21st-century democracies. The divide in the first round of France’s presidential elections is like many similar ones among today’s European electorates. Last year’s German election was a particularly notable case. Topically, it also bears comparison with the divide in the run-up to Northern Ireland’s crucial assembly election next week. Many people are still tempted to treat politics as a battle between a large party of the left and a large party of the right. Many facts and figures bely this. In France, the four strongest finishers on 10 April captured 28%, 23%, 22% and 7% of the vote respectively. In Germany last year, the top four had 26%, 24%, 15% and 13%. In Northern Ireland (where the divides are not merely left-right), the latest polls show the four strongest parties are Sinn Féin on 26%, Democratic Unionists 19%, Alliance 16% and Ulster Unionists 13%. If Northern Ireland was electing a president under the French two-round system, this would mean there would be a second-round run-off between Michelle O’Neill of Sinn Féin and Jeffrey Donaldson of the DUP. That’s never going to happen, fortunately for Northern Ireland, because it would fuel a wholly sectarian dynamic. But it illustrates the inbuilt weakness of any electoral system, such as France’s, which translates minority support in the first round into a majoritarian mandate in the second. Northern Ireland’s very deliberately does not do this. It is rooted instead in the power-sharing principles and practicalities of the 1998 Good Friday agreement. This means that Sinn Féin’s expected first-place finish on 5 May would in reality be a victory of only a limited kind, albeit one with headline-news value worldwide and enormous symbolic meaning. That a territory that was created 101 years ago specifically to cut itself adrift from Irish republicanism should now elect a first minister from that same republican tradition is a milestone in anyone’s language. In those circumstances, though, the chances of the DUP agreeing to nominate a deputy first minister to work alongside O’Neill as first minister are remote. The same goes for the possibility of an early referendum on Irish unification. It is much more likely that the failure of the two main parties to work together (both of them may lose share of the vote since the last contest in 2017) will hasten the return of direct rule from London. If the UK government also shreds the Northern Ireland protocol, as Lord Frost urged it to do in a speech on Wednesday, power-sharing will again be left high and dry. Electoral systems matter. Germany, France and Northern Ireland illustrate some of the different ways this works. But they are not unusual. Electoral systems do not only reflect politics; they also shape the way politics is conducted. This goes for Britain too. The first-past-the-post system routinely turns an electoral minority into a constituency victory or a parliamentary majority. It is part of the reason why our politics looks and sounds the way it does. And it is increasingly indefensible in the pluralistic political climate of the 21st century. Britain’s next general election may return another hung parliament, in which the electorate votes for change but does not give any one party the mandate to govern. Replacement of the first-past-the-post system will never be a big doorstep issue. But it would be a transformative act for Britain, and one that a minority Labour government could deliver. This country’s damaged democracy is in need of its own form of power-sharing. It would be a huge step towards creating anew a certain idea of Britain.

4/28/2022,"Boris Johnson used to be king of the capital. As a politician who presented himself as metropolitan and socially liberal, he gifted the Conservatives their first control of London-wide government for 30 years by winning the mayoralty in 2008. But now the party is facing one of its toughest electoral tests in the city, and the prime minister risks insurrection from his own backbenchers if the Partygate investigations threaten to hit them at the ballot box too. In the Tories’ flagship council of Wandsworth, voters are mulling whether the party’s headline pledge to keep council tax low is attractive enough during the cost of living crisis to keep them from staying at home or giving Labour a chance. While Labour inched ahead in the popular vote by just a few hundred votes at the last council elections, the Conservatives still clinched the highest number of councillors. “It doesn’t matter if we make great gains or even win overall control of a few other areas; if Wandsworth falls, that will be the narrative of the night,” admitted a minister who had been out campaigning in the area. Ruth, who lives in Battersea and used to be a Conservative member, said that as a barrister, she was deeply unhappy with the prime minister’s breach of Covid laws. “I usually would vote Conservative. But while it’s led by a man I don’t consider has integrity, I wouldn’t vote for them,” she said. Speaking as she was canvassed by a Conservative councillor at her home in south-west London, Ruth spoke plainly about the message she wanted to send. “I thought voting Conservative at the moment would seem an endorsement of the national party because it is being reported in the media that if there are bad local election results for Boris, then people may move against him, which is what I want to happen.” She admitted she was “very pleased with how the local party is acting”, but added: “The leader is such an important issue that you’ve just got to change that.” Margaret, who lives nearby and works as a teacher, is less concerned with Partygate and says she normally votes Conservative, but this time she is wavering. “I just think there’s so much nonsense with the party at the top,” she said. “It’s nothing to do with Partygate, it’s just that I don’t think he’s very competent. “I think he’s a bit of a disappointment. I had good hopes when he came in and I just think he’s really disappeared into the background. You hear nothing from him any more – other than when he’s made a mistake.” Margaret said she would probably abstain because she was unimpressed by Keir Starmer’s Labour, and added: “I’m a little bit disillusioned at the moment.” Lauren, who works for Citizens Advice, said she would normally vote Liberal Democrat and was tempted to vote for the Conservatives locally since it is a Labour-Tory toss-up. “It’s a challenge in your head to distinguish between the national party,” she said. Activists pounding the streets have lines at the ready for wavering voters such as Ruth, Margaret and Lauren. “It’s not Boris on the ballot paper,” is a common refrain. As is the argument that even if wealthier residents do not rely on Wandsworth’s lower council tax, their harder-pressed neighbours might. But it can still be a tough sell. In a nod to Geoffrey Howe’s criticism of Margaret Thatcher, one council candidate in the Lambeth and Southwark Conservatives WhatsApp group complained it would be “easier if the national party doesn’t break our local bats at the crease”. A Tory MP also privately moaned: “It’s like Downing Street hate Tory councillors and are figuring out how to have as few as possible.” Johnson certainly still has some supporters in London. When a Conservative canvasser knocked on Peter’s door and asked if he had any concerns about the party nationally, he said he did not and that the attention given to Covid rule-breaking was “a distraction”. “We’re in a proxy war with Russia,” Peter said. “And the prime minister’s essentially leading the free world.” And there are many pressing local issues that affect residents, from recycling to schools, crime and libraries. One resident, Antonietta, was desperate for the council and the police to crack down on motorcyclists driving dangerously fast along the pavement in front of her house. “If you do something about the road, you might have my support, otherwise, I’ll have to vote for somebody else,” she said when asked who she would back on 5 May. For Labour, the challenge is to remind voters that only a few hundred votes could turn the council red. While the number of volunteers offering to help with canvassing has plummeted since 2018 when a larger membership under Jeremy Corbyn was mobilised, fewer voters are now said to slam doors shut when activists arrive. “I’d say it’s going to be incredibly tight. It still looks like it’s on a knife-edge, genuinely a 50-50 election,” said Simon Hogg, Labour’s leader on Wandsworth council. He said the Conservative campaign was “just based around that single issue of council tax, whereas we’re matching that council tax, but we’re also having ambitious policies on the environment, on housing, on crime and on education as well”. Hogg admitted it was “a key issue in the election, whether Labour can be trusted with your money”, and understood concerns given Labour-run Croydon council was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. But he insisted Labour had a “serious, ambitious, costed manifesto, that we’re going to tax fairly”, and would “spend wisely”. He claimed the credibility of the Wandsworth Conservatives was dropping and that they no longer ran a tight ship. Hogg’s insistence the race appears to be on a knife-edge is not hyperbole. Jonathan Carr-West, the chief executive of the Local Government Information Unit, said that while polls suggested the Conservatives could lose control of the council, “it’s certainly close, both in terms of seats and in terms of the majorities within some seats”. He said: “Given Wandsworth’s prominence as a Conservative flagship, its loss would be seen as a serious blow to the government and will feed directly into the conversation about the prime minister’s future. “At the same time, it would be part of a longer-term trend in which Labour has tightened its grip on inner London. “Over the last decade, we have seen an increasing polarisation, with the Labour vote concentrated in large cities and university towns and Conservative support spread across the rest of the country. Wandsworth and Westminster have resisted this but the margins have been getting narrower.”",News/Politics,London galling: could Partygate sink the Tories’ Wandsworth flagship?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/28/london-galling-could-partygate-sink-the-tories-wandsworth-flagship
4/28/2022,"A soldier witness called by Ben Roberts-Smith in his defamation trial has told the federal court he liked social media posts that called an Afghan civilian allegedly murdered by Australian soldiers a “terrorist paedo”, and lawyers involved in the case “fuckwits” and “cunts”. The court heard the former SAS soldier, anonymised before the court as Person 35, liked an Instagram post that said: “Fun Facts: Ali Jan and the gentleman that met Soldier C were both Taliban, and, by default, terrorist p3dos.” The post says: #nothingofvaluewaslost The newspapers allege Ali Jan was an Afghan farmer detained by Australian soldiers during a raid on the village of Darwan in September 2012. They allege Ben Roberts-Smith kicked Ali Jan off a cliff while handcuffed and blindfolded before ordering him shot. Roberts-Smith has denied the allegation, saying that a man killed on the mission was an enemy “spotter” legitimately killed in accordance with the rules of engagement. In his evidence, he said “there was no cliff … there was no kick”. Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges were defamatory and portrayed him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. Soldier C, referred to in the Instagram post, was an Australian SAS soldier, unrelated to this case, filmed shooting an unarmed Afghan civilian lying in a field, the court was told by the newspapers’ barrister on Thursday. That man’s death is not part of this defamation trial. Under cross-examination, Person 35 said he resented the public scrutiny of Roberts-Smith’s actions in Afghanistan, without broader interrogation of the strategy and prosecution of the war in Afghanistan. “If you’re going to question a soldier about what happened overseas, then you need to question the military about what happened overseas,” he said. “I find it upsetting his conduct is being scrutinised.” Person 35 also liked an Instagram post that said: “When some fuckwit in a suit starts using his fucktard snake logic he learned getting his tonsils bruised by some lecturer’s spotty dick at their non-binary law school, remember one thing: that this cunt will be one of the first to be held down and drowned in a muddy puddle for his fancy jacket. “When society crumbles, it will be thanks to him and people like him thinking we all live on fucking Sesame Street and everyone adhering to their putrid way of thinking. Like my boy, Rorschach said, the accumulated filth of all their sex and murder will foam up about their waists, and all the whores and politicians will look up and shout, ‘save us’ and I’ll whisper, ‘no’.” Hermann Rorschach, the Swiss psychoanalyst, did not say those words. The quotes are from a fictional antihero character of the same name in the comic book series and film Watchmen. Person 35 said he “liked a lot of posts” on Instagram and other social media posts, as “a bit of dark humour … I don’t think it should be taken seriously”. During a tense exchange, Nicholas Owens SC, acting for the newspapers, put it to Person 35 the “fuckwit” in a fancy jacket was him. Person 35 denied he was talking about Owens specifically. “That’s a joke,” Person 35 said. “It’s meant to be funny, and it’s meant to agitate and it seems to have worked.” Person 35 gave evidence about a 2012 party at the SAS’s unofficial on-base bar in Afghanistan, the Fat Ladies’ Arms. He told the court he dressed up as a Ku Klux Klansman because he didn’t want to pay for a costume ordered by mail, and could make the costume himself. Pictures from the party show him in the Klan costume, holding a burning cross. He said he was not reprimanded for wearing the costume. Instead, he told the court: “I won the fancy dress competition that night. “I knew one other person was coming in blackface so I thought it would be funny if I came as a Klansman … [to] make fun of the Klan itself, they are pretty pathetic, I was just making a joke about it.” Regarding the allegation that Roberts-Smith murdered Ali Jan in Darwan in 2012, Person 35 said he did not believe Roberts-Smith kicked Ali Jan off a cliff, but conceded before court he was not present at the final compound cleared during the mission. “I know my friend Ben, and I know he wouldn’t do that,” Person 35 said. “I can speak to the man’s character yes, and I don’t believe he did that, I do not. Was I in that last compound? No, I was not there.” Person 35 said he supported Roberts-Smith, who he regarded as a friend, but denied a suggestion from Owens he was a partisan witness. “I’ve chosen a side, but I’m here to tell the truth.” He said the soldiers who had been subpoenaed to testify by the newspapers had lied to the court. “Your witnesses just aren’t truthful, they are lying.” Person 35 agreed he had liked social media posts that described comrades who had spoken to the media as “rats” and “snitches”. “The ones that have spoken to the media are lying.” The court heard Person 35’s legal bills are being paid by Channel Seven chairman Kerry Stokes. Person 35 said he had never met Stokes, but said he had asked Roberts-Smith, an employee of Stokes at Channel Seven, for assistance with legal representation before his interview by the inspector general of the Australian defence force, who was investigating allegations of war crimes by Australian soldiers. Person 35 said he “simply didn’t trust” free lawyers he was offered by the defence force. Person 35 remains in the witness box.
