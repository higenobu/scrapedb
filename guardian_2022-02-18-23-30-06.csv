2/18/2022,"Dozens of schools in Philadelphia are suffering from lead contamination in their water lines, an environmental report has found, potentially exposing tens of thousands of students to toxins proven to cause learning and behavioral issues as well as health problems including damage to internal organs.  The Philadelphia school board disputes the findings of the study by PennPirg (Pennsylvania public interest research group), insisting that systems are in place to prevent students and staff drinking contaminated water, and that any outlet found with lead in excess of acceptable limits is immediately shut down. But the study’s authors say that the data it has reviewed so far is “just the tip of the iceberg” of the problem across the school district of almost 200,000 students, and is calling for the replacement of every drinking fountain with water bottle filling stations, and filtration systems to be installed in kitchens and other facilities where water is used for consumption. “Philadelphia’s children deserve safe drinking water, especially at the schools where they go each day to learn and play. As this data shows, it is critical that Philadelphia decision-makers take immediate action to get the lead out,” the study says. PennPirg reviewed data reported by the school district under a 2017 law that requires lead testing on every campus at least every five years, and for the results to be made publicly available. But the group said that by the start of this month, four years into the cycle, only 29% of the district’s 323 schools had posted information online, covering drinking fountains, kitchen faucets, hydration stations and sinks in classrooms and bathrooms. From a review of that data, the study found, 61% of the 1,932 outlets tested showed lead contamination greater than one part per billion, and that of the 65 schools for which data was available, 98% had at least one outlet with contamination in excess of that level. One outlet at the Tanner G Duckrey public school, a pre-K to 8th grade campus in north Philadelphia, showed levels of lead at 8,768ppb. The long-running dirty water crisis in Flint, Michigan, brought new scrutiny of levels of water contamination nationwide, and Joe Biden’s administration has promised to make the issue a priority, announcing ambitious plans in December to replace 100% of lead pipes in homes across the country. “The science on lead is settled – there is no safe level of exposure and it is time to remove this risk to support thriving people and vibrant communities,” the environmental protection agency (EPA) administrator Michael S Regan said in a statement at the time. But critics noted there was no plan to reduce the existing “acceptable” level of lead in water from a Donald Trump-era rule of 15ppb, and that no timeline was announced for the pipe replacement. Additionally, they feared that economically deprived areas and those with high populations of racial minorities would be overlooked. “Children, especially those in the pre-K to seven-year-old age range, and particularly children of color and those from low-wealth communities, are among those most vulnerable to environmental toxins and exposures of all kinds,’” said Jerry Roseman, director of environmental science and occupational safety and health for the Philadelphia federation of teachers. “Substandard conditions in many school spaces continue to exist and to present health risks to students, as well as staff; ensuring that adequate, accessible and lead-free drinking water is readily available to all students and other school occupants is an absolute bottom line requirement for every school in Philadelphia.” In a statement to ABC News, the Philadelphia school district said the study was “not an accurate reflection of the water quality that students and staff in our district are accessing each and every day. “In the event that a water outlet tests at or above 10ppb, the city of Philadelphia’s required threshold for school drinking water, the outlet is immediately shut down. “The district closes these outlets, both because it is required under city and EPA regulations, and to prevent students or staff from using or ingesting contaminated water.”",News/US news,"Water in dozens of Philadelphia schools contaminated with lead, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/18/philadelphia-schools-lead-water-dozens
2/18/2022,"It is the TV drama that has divided its viewers. Hailed by some as a brutally accurate depiction of the realities of working in an NHS maternity unit, This Is Going to Hurt has been denounced by others as misogynistic and insulting to women giving birth. Now the actor who plays an exhausted and stressed female junior doctor in the show has rejected criticism of the BBC series set on an NHS obstetrics and gynaecology ward.  Ambika Mod – who plays the part of Shruti, considered by some viewers as the drama’s most compelling character – said she had received “many lovely messages from people saying you’ve portrayed the NHS so accurately – that’s really rewarding because it’s what we set out to do”. The seven-part drama is based on the bestselling memoir by Adam Kay, who spent six years as an NHS doctor, regularly taking life-and-death decisions while exhausted by 97-hour working weeks. Billed by the BBC as “comedy-drama”, it graphically depicts caesarean sections, placentas, body fluids and chaos in the hospital’s “brats and twats” department. The lead male doctor is played by Ben Whishaw. Mod said she was aware of claims that the series depicted birth as traumatic and women as disempowered and dysfunctional, but “we were as respectful towards women as we possibly could be”. Shruti was a “complex female character” and the production team had included many women, she said. Mod researched the role by talking to junior doctors to find out how the job affects them “socially, emotionally, mentally”. A lot of viewers had been grateful that the drama “showed childbirth as it actually is – because it is brutal, it is messy, and it is gory. And that’s not something we’ve seen on television before,” she said. “It’s important we engage with reality. The NHS is one of the greatest things about this country, and we need to protect it.” Some viewers have said the drama relegates female patients to “slabs of meat” who play no part in decisions about delivering their babies or receiving treatment. Milli Hill, founder of the Positive Birth Movement, said Kay’s book was “blatantly disrespectful towards women. It sums up the misogyny that’s baked into maternity care – the idea that any woman who thinks she can control labour or plan for labour is an idiot, basically.” Hill, who had only watched the first episode of the series when she spoke to the Guardian, said it had been “really triggering” for some viewers. “What women are objecting to, from the messages people are sending me, is women’s trauma being played for laughs,” she said. Hill said that the drama was “all about [Kay], how hard it is for him. You’re not seeing anything of the women’s stories, you just see them as body parts in the background. It shouldn’t be him who’s the hero at the centre of the story, it should be the women who get to tell their version of events.” She added: “There is no excuse for a woman to be traumatised by childbirth. And yet the more it’s beamed into our living rooms like that, the more it becomes a vicious circle. I’ve had loads of pregnant women getting in touch with me, saying is that what it’s going to be like? They’re absolutely terrified.” Some pregnant women said on social media that they had been advised by their midwives not to watch the series. Community midwife Rachael Dewey tweeted that the show “demeans women’s experiences/bodies and has dramatised attitudes we’re trying to move away from in midwifery/obs and gynaecology. Calling obs and gynae ‘Brats and twats’ – just sums it up really … It’s not representative of respectful maternity care and how birthing women should be portrayed.” But Juliet Pearce, director of nursing midwifery at the Isle of Wight NHS trust, said the show was “hilarious and heartbreaking” and a “reminder of the human emotions behind every tired, scared and fallible healthcare professional”. Jess Phillips, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley and an advocate for women’s rights, said she loved Kay’s book, which she had read on the recommendation of a midwife friend, and had begun watching the TV series. Kay “shows the strain doctors are under, and a system that’s creaking and cracking”, she said. Her own experience of giving birth in an NHS hospital had negatives “but I also felt completely supported by the amazing staff”. In a statement, Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said the drama “exposes the harsh realities that healthcare professionals can face when they work in the field of obstetrics and gynaecology in the NHS”. He added: “The show also explores what happens when birth complications arise, or when things go wrong which can be very upsetting to watch … The traumatic scenes of the programme can be difficult for women and their families as it shows experiences of pregnant women who have had poor birth outcomes. “We want to reassure women that the NHS is still one of the safest places to give birth in the world.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘Childbirth as it really is’: This Is Going to Hurt actor defends series accused of misogyny,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/18/it-is-brutal-this-is-going-to-hurt-actor-defends-series-accused-of-misogyny
2/18/2022,"The first and last word on this RSC production has to be on its dazzling design. Set in a high-concept Messina inspired by Afrofuturism and sci-fi, it comes with a wardrobe and stage set that will have any audience member’s eyes on stalks. There are gold fountains, silver frocks and stupendous white afros. Each costume and set change outdoes the one before it. It is what you might expect if Baz Luhrmann adapted Much Ado About Nothing into a lavish theatrical romcom.  A space-age backdrop gives the impression that we are aboard the Starship Enterprise, the cast like inhabitants of a newly discovered faraway planet. There are twists of Black Panther too along with The Lion King and Nasa-inspired 1970s designs of Pierre Cardin. The director is Roy Alexander Weise but this is not so much his production as that of the costume designer, Melissa Simon-Hartman, and the set designer, Jemima Robinson. On looks alone this would get the full five stars, but the show as a whole skitters too much on its shimmering surfaces. The central gender switch works well: Don Pedro is now Pedra (Ann Ogbomo), a princess who woos Hero (Taya Ming) on behalf of Claudio (Mohammed Mansaray) and then flirts with Beatrice (Akiya Henry). The suggestion is that in this universe there are no gendered preferences in romance and marriage. But the pace and performances seem out of kilter; it begins on a high-octane note with Pedra, Claudio and Benedick swooping from the ceiling on ropes wearing coloured capes and looking like futuristic superheroes – high energy with a great dollop of kitsch. A shimmering set-piece is built around the masquerade ball. “Good evening, Messina. Are you having a good time tonight?” croons a singer clad head to foot in gold. The music, composed by Mobo award-nominated Femi Temowo, takes us from Afrobeat to soul and reggae. It is all super-cool but begins to take on the look and feel of a pop video or an advert for high-end vodka. Several performances lack depth and subtlety, with lines declaimed rather than felt. At over three hours, it begins to plod. There is not enough shock and psychic violence in Claudio’s public shaming of Hero when he wrongly accuses her of pre-marital sex, and Hero’s surprise reappearance at the end, having been proclaimed dead, does not bring the emotional uplift that it should. A Christmas panto energy begins to creep into the second half, too, with cartoonish overacting between a gender-reversed Dogberry (Karen Henthorn) and her motley crew. Michael Balogun withdrew from the role of Benedick last week and his understudy, Luke Wilson, is one of the strongest forces in this cast (Balogun’s own breakthrough performance came in Death of England: Delroy as an understudy after Giles Terera pulled out). Wilson brings mischief and likability to his part, opposite Henry’s flamboyant and minxish Beatrice. They are good sparring partners in their witty skirmishes but lack romantic energy. So do Hero and Claudio, which keeps us at arm’s length from the emotional drama of this play and all its near-tragic moments. What stays in the mind is the breathtaking aesthetics. Simon-Hartman and Robinson deserve an Olivier, and every other accolade going.

2/18/2022,"I wish I could have a better relationship with my grandmother. She has been recognised as a difficult person, a liar and highly critical for as long as I remember. She pits family members against each other, picks fights, says what she wants. If we act offended, she gets defensive and tries to make us believe we misunderstood. She has lived a difficult life; my grandfather was always cheating on her, and left her with no money. She built her own life from scratch, gave my aunt money after her divorce, and welcomed me in her house after I was kicked out of my own. I try to act grateful, but the best I can do is help her financially, as spending time with her kills me inside, and can leave me enraged to a point that’s unhealthy.  We all more or less avoid her. I visit once a week. She’s in her early 80s, smart and in good health, doesn’t require any assistance, but her memory isn’t the best. She has started socialising with women in her neighbourhood, but still finds fault in every little thing her new “friends” do. I know this isn’t the life she wanted. I’d like to have a loving relationship where we’d see each other more often, but what I really want is for her to be different. What can I do? As you say, unfortunately you can’t turn her into the magical grandmother you want. If she is like this now, I wonder what she was really like when she was younger. I often think how unfair it is that we compare “difficult” older members of the family with younger members. It’s not a level playing field. That said, your grandmother sounds very trying and does have to own her current behaviour. What stops you being like the rest of the family and avoiding her? I went to psychotherapist Arabella Russell, who said sometimes members of the family “hold” all the bad behaviour for the others – ie, as long as we are complaining about “grumpy Aunt Mary or Uncle John”, we can avoid looking at other aspects, such as our own part in things. I’d heard about this being done to children, but have to admit I never thought about it happening in the other direction. Russell and I both wondered why you feel you have to fix it. “It seems as if you can’t quite pull away from [the situation],” said Russell. She reminded me that “every criticism is an unmet need”. I paused on that for a while. Russell added: “Your grandmother has felt abandoned her whole life and finds others’ happiness very hard. You seem to understand that, but how much of this is your own pain and the fear of where you may end up?” Do you see anything of yourself in her? “You can only change the way you are around your grandmother,” said Russell, “but I wondered if there’s a critical voice in you thinking, ‘If I get on better with her, will I get on better with the more difficult [or, I would say, needy] parts of me?’” We both noted your mother “kicked you out” when you were young. That must have been hard. Maybe you felt abandoned, too. I wonder if that part of your life might be worth exploring. Look at what you can practically do with regard to your grandmother: a change to your visits, which may lessen the impact? Visiting more frequently, but for less time, may help. Could you do something together that doesn’t involve talking? Ultimately, however, if this continues to hurt you to the point it “kills you inside”, you need to ask yourself: why am I doing this?

2/18/2022,"‘The Premier League is known as the top league in the world so it’s definitely going to be a lot tougher,” Michael Olise said in his first interview as a Crystal Palace player. “But nothing I’m not ready for, so …” Seven months on, the versatile forward whose dazzling array of skills briefly graced the academies of Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City has shown he is back where he belongs. Olise’s return of two goals and three assists from the 314 Premier League minutes he had played for Palace by the start of January meant that with a goal contribution every 63 minutes, the 20-year-old was the division’s most productive player.  His instant success at Selhurst Park has come as no surprise to Sean Conlon, who first met him when Olise was playing for his local side Hayes in west London at the age of seven. “He’s always been someone who scores goals because his control is so good and he is thinking so many steps ahead of everyone else,” Conlon says. “Michael also has so much variety in his technique that allows him to see the picture and means he is able to make the decision on what is the most appropriate finish.” Conlon had just left Chelsea as a coach and was working as a scout for QPR but was so impressed that he recommended Olise to his former employers. “Michael was also training with Arsenal at the time because before you move into the under-nines, you’re allowed to train with multiple teams,” he says. “But he probably lived closer to Chelsea and they obviously have a great academy so he ended up signing for them.” While at Chelsea Olise also received individual training from Conlon’s company We Make Footballers, which specialises in developing players between the ages of three and 12, and turned out for his grassroots team. “I’ve always said that from the age of nine Michael has been the best player for his age in the country,” Conlon says. “He’s always been very graceful and elegant in the way that he moves. But it was when he went into the academy setup at Chelsea that his technique began to shine and all of his ability on the ball started coming through. And then as he has got older his football IQ developed so he answered almost every question that was asked of him.” Although Olise always appeared destined for success, his departure from Chelsea at 14 – described as “a mutual decision” by Conlon – was a reminder that there are never guarantees in football. Having spent a few weeks travelling to Manchester to train with City, he went six months without a club. “Sometimes people don’t think about it being hard for players who are supremely talented because that can also come with its own difficulties,” Conlon says. “It’s not been a perfect journey for Michael but I think that has benefited him. Coming out of Chelsea at that age has given him that resilience and desire to succeed.” Before joining Reading, where he made close to 70 Championship appearances and was crowned EFL Young Player of the Season last year, Olise played in several showcase games that Conlon had arranged. “We had all the scouts from clubs in London watching and everyone was just in disbelief about how good Michael was,” he says. “I videoed those games and I need to get them off the hard drive … I’ve taken one of them to the shop because I was like: ‘Oh my God, there’s gold on these!’” Patrick Vieira has carefully managed Olise’s integration into the Palace first team, having seen off interest from City and others to sign him for £8m in the summer after activating the release clause. “He’s making huge progress from when he arrived to six months after – I think he’s a different player,” Vieira said last week. Olise has made only five Premier League starts but cemented his status as a fans’ favourite with a goal and an assist at their local rivals Millwall in a heated FA Cup third-round tie during which he taunted home supporters after being struck by a bottle as he prepared to take a corner. “I remember when Michael came down to play for my seven-a-side team at Alperton goals,” Conlon says. “It was full of semi-pro players who were so aggressive. Michael came and, at the age of 14, he was the best player. And because of his character, everyone liked him and respected him. He might be a little bit quiet but he’s humble and very polite. I’ve heard some of his teammates referring to him as the rock star. He has got something very unique about his persona.” Judging by the cool celebration after another brilliant goal against Hartlepool in the Cup fourth round, Olise has found his swagger in south London. Conlon also coached Liverpool’s Harvey Elliott and Olise’s younger brother Richard – a promising right-back who has been a regular for Chelsea Under-18s this season – and recently introduced a scholarship named after the Olise brothers that provides two young players from Hayes with free coaching sessions. “When he signed for Palace I spoke to his dad and they were just so grateful for the situation,” he says. Olise’s father is from Nigeria and his mother’s heritage means that Olise is eligible to play for France and Algeria as well as England. His only international appearances have been for France at the 2019 Toulon under-age tournament and Conlon is intrigued to see which country Olise ends up representing. “I would imagine that there could be quite a few options for him in the end. Michael takes his football very seriously and knows where he wants to get to.”",Sport/Football,Michael Olise: from Chelsea exit to sparkling form at Crystal Palace,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/18/michael-olise-crystal-palace-chelsea-reading
2/18/2022,"As a wine writer, you might imagine that I enjoy being handed the wine list at restaurants, but, like many of you, I suspect, I usually groan inwardly. Finding a wine that everyone will enjoy and that goes with everything you’re eating is a tall order, and even if you spot one that you think will do the job, you still have to hope that everyone will be as willing as you are to pay for it. Mind you, it’s often not a bad plan simply to order the cheapest wine on the list in any restaurant that cares about the quality of its wine offering, because it will probably be more than decent. I remember once going to the three Michelin-starred Michel Bras in France to find a local wine listed at just €15 (about £12.50), an object lesson to other restaurants that take themselves far too seriously.  My approach is simple: I almost always order something I don’t recognise or haven’t tried, because that’s one of the best ways of discovering new wines and getting the chance – which you don’t have at tastings – to try them with food. You can mitigate the risk by ordering by the glass, although many restaurants, including The Old Pharmacy in Bruton, Somerset, where I discovered the delicious L’Abrunet Negre in today’s pick, will give you a sip to try. And do get over the idea that sommeliers are out to fleece you: most will be delighted to make a recommendation, and it’s up to you to indicate what style of wine you like and what you can afford. A lot of wines in the more interesting new restaurants these days are natural, so you also need to disabuse yourself of the idea that they’re all funky and weird. A few will be, sure, but most aren’t. As with food, it’s more a question of what your previous experience is. Wines such as the Chilean La Patagua in today’s pick might look unfamiliar because they’re unfiltered, but they are really delicious. Again, ask your server if you’re uncertain. If you haven’t tried natural wine before, just say so, and ask for something that’s not too scary. I really don’t think people have enough conversations about wine in restaurants – maybe because they’re nervous about appearing to lack knowledge – but being in a good restaurant or wine bar is a brilliant way to learn. Finally, look out for older vintages on any list. Supermarkets by and large sell the most recent vintage, but good restaurants and pubs will often pick up odd bottles and bin ends for customers who they know will appreciate them. Be one of them. La Patagua 2021 £9 lola.co.uk, £9.05 Les Caves de Pyrène, 14.5%. Mouthwateringly delicious, slightly hazy semillon from Chile, unusually. A perfect wine bar white. Domaine d’Escausses Gaillac Cuvée des Drilles 2019 £10.90 Joseph Barnes Wines, 13.5%. Dryish, with a bitter cherry twist, this south-western French red is a classic bistro wine that would be as good with charcuterie as with steak frîtes. Frisach L’Abrunet Negre Terra Alta 2020 £14 littlewine.co, £14.40 Uncharted Wines, 13.5%. Joyous, juicy Catalan red, a blend of garnacha and carinena, that would be a great match for tapas. Domaine de la Semellerie Chinon Rosé 2020 £11.99 Virgin Wines, 12.5%. Even at this time of year, you get the odd sunny day that cries out for a glass of rosé, and this light, pretty one from the Loire totally hits the spot.

2/18/2022,"Caroline Flack’s mother has said she cannot properly come to terms with her daughter’s death while questions remain over the Metropolitan police decision to charge the TV star with assault. The police watchdog has instructed Scotland Yard to review a complaint that the Love Island and X Factor presenter was treated differently by the force when she was facing prosecution for assaulting her boyfriend because she was a celebrity.  Christine Flack believes the police decision to press ahead with charging her daughter over the incident – rather than giving her a caution as prosecutors advised initially – contributed to her taking her own life at her home in London on 15 February 2020. “I can’t get her back,” Flack said in an interview with the Guardian. “I just want the police to come out and say: we really shouldn’t have gone back to the Crown Prosecution Service, there wasn’t enough to charge her. I don’t want anything from them other than to say they got it wrong.” Flack, who first complained to the Met a month after Caroline’s death, said she cannot relent in her fight to clear her daughter’s name. “Carrie wasn’t an abuser. I can’t give up because people are still writing that now, two years after her death. It needs someone in authority to come out and say that wasn’t true,” she said. “You just can’t put her to rest properly with all that negativity round her. You think about it every day. I find myself apologising for her, and I shouldn’t.” The TV host was arrested in December 2019 and charged with attacking her boyfriend, Lewis Burton, with a lamp at their home in Islington, north London. She had pleaded not guilty, having previously told police that she accidentally hit Burton with a phone while he slept. She killed herself two months later, days before the start of what her mother later called a “show trial”, since Burton had said he did not support a prosecution. Last March, the Met told Christine Flack it was satisfied the service provided by the officer who made the decision to charge Caroline was acceptable. But in August, after she asked the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) to review the case, it directed the Met to reinvestigate one element of her complaint: whether the decision was in line with standard practice, “and to establish if there was any difference in the way in which the process had been followed in this case on account of a person’s celebrity”. Flack said she worried that negative coverage by the tabloid press, which had long critically scrutinised her daughter’s love life, and abusive social media posts could have affected the police’s judgment. An inquest into the TV host’s death in 2020 heard that she had self-harmed at the scene of the alleged assault and was taken to hospital for a psychiatric assessment but deemed fit for police interview. “The police could see she tried to commit suicide that night,” her mother said. “She had hurt herself before and as a teenager attempted suicide.” A coroner ruled the presenter had taken her own life because she knew she was facing prosecution and feared the negative publicity the trial would attract. “She couldn’t get over that people might find out that she was actually vulnerable,” Flack added. “She did hide it really well.” Flack said the unanswered questions about her daughter’s prosecution aggravated her grief. “I don’t sleep,” she said. “I don’t want to sound sorry for myself but I can cope with things because I take tablets from the doctor. And I’m frightened to stop taking those because I think it all becomes a bit real then.” She added that she dreaded receiving monthly updates from the Met about the ongoing investigation. “Your stomach goes over,” she said. “Although I want answers, you’re frightened to look because you think well it’s just gonna be: ‘Oh, there was nothing wrong.’” Despite their ongoing trauma, Flack, who lives in Norwich, said her family was able to remember Caroline warmly on the second anniversary of her death on Tuesday. Together with her eldest daughter, Lizzie, her son Paul and Caroline’s twin, Jody, she visited Caroline’s memorial bench in Norfolk. “It was pouring with rain and windy. And Lizzie looked at me and said: ‘Mum, Carrie wouldn’t have come, would she?’ And I said: ‘No, she’d have made some excuse.’ We just laughed.” In a statement confirming the reinvestigation of one element of Christine Flack’s complaint earlier this week, the Met said: “Our thoughts and sympathies remain with Caroline’s family.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

2/18/2022,"When Simon Rogan and his family moved to Cumbria in 2002, the Lake District was famed for many reasons but food was not top of the menu. Visitors came in droves for the hills, rather than the haute cuisine. Twenty years later their feted village restaurant, L’Enclume, is at the centre of a “mind-blowing” culinary renaissance that has led some diners to compare Cumbria to international foodie havens such as Paris, San Sebastián and Copenhagen.  The comparisons are not so outlandish: Cumbria now has more Michelin stars than any other UK county, and L’Enclume this week became the first restaurant outside London or Berkshire to win the coveted three stars. Not bad for the land of mint cake and spicy sausage. “This is a cluster in a world-class landscape. It is not just nationally significant but it’s globally significant,” said Thom Hetherington, an industry judge and chief executive of the Northern Restaurant and Bar show in Manchester. L’Enclume, housed in a 13th-century former blacksmith’s in the ancient village of Cartmel, on the southern tip of the Lake District, focuses on seasonal “farm-to-fork” dining, using only produce from Rogan’s nearby 4.8-hectare (12-acre) farm and other local providers. A day after its third Michelin star was announced, the champagne corks have been cleared away and quiet chatter fills the small dining room of oak beams and low ceilings. Guests wait months for a seat in Rogan’s restaurant, where a 10-course lunch menu costs £100. By this weekend, L’Enclume is expected to be fully booked until 2023. “We’re not the only ones who are fully booked – all the restaurants are in the Lake District,” said Rogan, adding that the local hospitality industry had “exploded” since restaurants reopened after the pandemic. This is partly explained, he said, by the region shrugging off hackneyed stereotypes about northern cuisine – bread and dripping, chips and gravy – and becoming a gastronomic counterweight to London. A new breed of visitor has discovered, or rediscovered, the Lakes during lockdown: the young, free-spending millennial. This younger generation of diner has helped shift a “lazy” perception of the north and its grub: “There has been this ‘grim up north, nothing really happens up there’ attitude but Covid has smashed that out of the park,” Rogan said. Cumbria now has one star for every 48,000 people, compared with one for every 98,000 in London. The Dog and Gun inn, a family-run gastropub in the village of Skelton, near Penrith, was the latest to be added to the list this week. Hetherington, a judge in the annual National Restaurant Awards, said the density of world-class restaurants in Cumbria was “mind-blowing” and that northern England was now “starting to punch above its weight” as a culinary destination. “You look at affluent, international, serious foodies travelling all over the world and they want to go to Tokyo or Paris and San Sebastián or Copenhagen. For me, the Lake District is absolutely at that level,” he said. “If you went back 20, 25 years there was certainly some truth in the idea that the food scene in the north of England was significantly lagging behind London,” he added. “I think that has not only levelled up, but it’s almost tipped in the north’s favour now.” Last year’s National Restaurant Awards said four out of five of the UK’s best restaurants were in northern England, while four of the top five gastropubs were in Yorkshire and Lancashire. Rogan, who now has four Michelin stars to his name (another restaurant, Rogan & Co has one star), ascribes the north’s success in part to the ever-growing British appetite for sustainable, locally sourced produce and increasingly “savvy” local farmers, whom he says have “really upped their game” in recent years. Top chefs are also drawn to the region in search of a better quality of life and more affordable property. Two of Rogan’s proteges, Tom Barnes and Paul Burgalières, were lured to work in sleepy Cartmel (population: 4,000) from one of the world’s stellar restaurants, Geranium in Copenhagen. Rogan, who joins the UK’s small pantheon of three-star chefs, who include his former mentor Marco Pierre White, said the accolade was “a dream come true” – but that he was “gutted” his Windermere restaurant, Henrock, had missed out. He is confident, however, that more awards will follow. “There’s other places knocking on the door and sleeping giants that are waking up,” he said. “Every chef or operator wants a piece of it and it’s attracting incredible talent to the county now. I do see a lot more Michelin stars.”",Lifestyle/Food,How L’Enclume’s Michelin win is taking Cumbria to the top of the foodie table,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/18/how-lenclumes-michelin-win-is-taking-cumbria-to-the-top-of-the-foodie-table
2/18/2022,"Brandon Brown was not an especially fearsome stock car driver, nor did he figure as the sort to crack open sport’s Pandora’s box entering last October’s Sparks 300 – a race in Nascar’s mid-tier Xfinity series. In most cases a mid-pack qualifying position would not bode well. But at Talladega Speedway, a crash-happy oval circuit where anything can happen, the best drivers are the ones who survive the carnage. And after two multi-car pile ups, Brown assumed a narrow lead with 13 laps to go. A final accident two laps later that took out seven cars sealed his first Xfinity series triumph in 114 tries. With night falling on the Alabama circuit, the 28-year-old Virginia native emerged from his Chevrolet Camaro machine in a daze for the post-race TV interview. As he breathlessly thanked his sponsors and revisited his driving tactics, some in Talladega’s packed crowd began chanting “Fuck Joe Biden” loud and clear enough to come across Brown’s microphone. Desperate to keep the interview going with her producers unable to bleep the background noise, NBC Sports reporter Kelli Stavast tried to Jedi mind trick her viewers. “You can hear the chants from the crowd – Let’s go, Brandon,” she said.  Since then, Let’s Go Brandon has gone from awkward TV moment to harmless meme to conservative dog whistle on par with Maga hats and OK hand gestures – a way of insulting the president without triggering censorship. It adorns lawn signs and bumper stickers. One guy said it directly to Biden last Christmastime as the president and first lady were taking calls into Norad’s Santa tracker from the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Another guy got kicked off a flight this week for having Let’s Go Brandon writ small on his facemask. As the slogan exacerbates the deepening political divide in the country, Brown has so far struggled in his attempts to ride the median. Brown laughed off the Let’s Go Brandon cheers initially, then went silent when it morphed into something more sinister. Finally, in a December New York Times interview, he expressed a wish to distance himself from the now politically charged slogan, not wanting to cost his family-run team hundreds of thousands in potential sponsorship support. “If they’re going to use my name,” Brown, a Republican, said of his fellow conservatives, “I’d like for it to be productive.” In a subsequent Newsweek op-ed titled My Name Is Brandon, he described himself as a driver “in the passenger seat of my own viral moment,” albeit a squarely middle-class one with a lot of thoughts about inflation affecting prices at the pump. (“I buy more gas than most,” he quipped.) Still, he was quick to assure readers that he wasn’t “going to tell anyone how to vote” or had any “interest in leading some political fight.” But then just before the new year, Brown appeared to quickly abandon those ideals for a two-season, eight-figure sponsorship pact with LGBcoin.io, a cryptocurrency that’s literally short for Let’s Go Brandon. The announcement unveiling Brandon’s red, white and blue repainted car called him “truly America’s driver.” But as with most things crypto, the wealth infusion – a lifeline for a family-run racing operation that came close to closing its doors – disappeared as quickly as it arrived. But instead of a cyber raider or a pyramid scheme it was Nascar president Steve Phelps who pumped the brakes on the deal out of a desire to unseat the sport from any politics on either side of the aisle, lest it turn off the new fans the sport urgently seeks. And then the invisible hand of the crypto market dealt the finishing blow. After achieving a peak liquidity pool value of $6.5m at the start of the year, the coin crashed and burned. It is now worth close to zero. The lost funding puts Brown back in the position of having to cobble together sponsors, an effort that will be obvious in the varying paint schemes and decals that adorn his car this year – beginning with the Saturday race that undercards Sunday’s Daytona 500. And Brown, who starts from the back of the pack yet again, will have his work cut out for himself throughout the season in the hustle for patronage. The Original Larry’s Hard Lemonade, a sponsor on Brown’s Talladega-winning car, dropped him in response to the bitcoin deal. “All money is not good money,” company founder Vic Reynolds cautioned in a farewell statement. Politically motivated sponsorship might seem toxic now, making it easier for Phelps to drop the hammer on Brown, but precedent suggests it’s only a matter of time before they have it both ways. Not only have drivers raced machines with Bush-Cheney and Trump-Pence livery in the recent past, but it wasn’t even two years ago that Bubba Wallace raced a Black Lives Matter car on the way to leading a campaign to banish displays of the confederate flag from the sport – although the organisation didn’t pay him for that exposure. Sponsorship dollars are hard enough to chase down in this economy. If anything, Brown may have unwittingly stumbled upon an untapped market: political zealots. If his efforts to exploit them continue to get struck down, don’t be surprised if this becomes the movement that emerges in response to Wallace’s progressive push on the way to Nascar becoming the next front in the raging culture wars – and here at least those zealots have a point. With everyone from the former president to mom-and-pops cashing in on the Let’s Go Brandon craze, it seems the only one who isn’t making much money off of this is the guy who inspired the whole thing –and arguably deserves to profit most. For now, though, Brown seems content not to push the issue while continuing the hustle for sponsorship. But, really, there’s no telling how soon he could find himself facing back inside a conference room with another would-be supporter with real money and right-wing ideology. At that point he’ll have to decide whether selling out is worth his soul and his sport’s, leaving the lid on Pandora’s box well in the dust.

2/18/2022,"Mimi Webb is proof that social media really can make a career. After her heartbreak ballads blew up on TikTok during the pandemic, she has risen through the ranks to become something of a breakout star, landing on the BBC Sound of 2022 shortlist. When she makes mention of TikTok tonight, the whole room erupts: it is the reason why so many teens have fallen for her internet-era takes on love and loss.  Webb is a self-confessed fan of Emeli Sandé and Sam Smith, and her blueprint is clear: big radio-friendly ballads peppered with Gen-Z references. Good Without, the weepy viral sensation that she saves until the show’s close, is executed flawlessly, while new song House on Fire ups the tempo with a healthy measure of spice, as she sweetly threatens arson in a fit of lovelorn revenge. It’s the kind of hyperbolic good humour that turns her fans wild: the song has only just been released but they’ve all heard the previews on TikTok and scream the words back into each other’s phones with glee. In between these gems, though, the evening starts to plod. Webb is a slick, professional performer. Her voice, a strong and husky alto-soprano, is one of true star potential, and her mega-watt smile remains undimmed as she paces the stage like it’s a treadmill. But she sticks devoutly to a well-rehearsed formula, trading spontaneous sincerity for an arsenal of cliches. Her shouts of “Hands up!”, “How we doing?” and “Stay hydrated!” are as unimaginative as many of her songs. On Lonely in Love, she demands for the millionth time for the crowd to “Sing with me!”, but the stadium chorus is pitched far too high, well out of the reach of her now-silent audience. It appears to shake her, a brief crack in an otherwise perfect veneer. As an artist who speaks to the most intimate of emotions, Webb clearly has heart. But her lack of vulnerability on stage suggests that she may still be holding her audience at arm’s length – almost as if she was looking at them through a screen.

2/18/2022,"The Six Nations organisers have claimed they are not currently planning to admit South Africa to the championship despite continued suggestions the Springboks want to join the competition after 2025. Organisers have always been publicly lukewarm to the idea of expansion but after it emerged that South Africa had put the southern hemisphere’s governing body, Sanzaar, on notice that they were exploring the option of joining the Six Nations, they have released a statement insisting they “are not entertaining any discussion” over expansion.  They have also moved to quash the idea that South Africa are set to replace Italy as opposed to join the existing six teams in a seven-nation competition. Given Italy would have to agree to being removed from the competition that was always an unlikely proposition even in the face of an astronomical financial offer. The statement stops short of ruling out South Africa ever joining the championship but spells out that the current priority is the restructuring of the global calendar and the remodelling of the July and November international windows. Key meetings will take place next month over a revamped global competition to be held every two years from 2024. “Six Nations Rugby, comprising the six unions and federations and CVC, wish to confirm that they are not entertaining any discussion nor developing any plans to add or replace any participating union,” read the statement. “All its energy is focused on the current strategic discussions regarding the July and November international windows and structure of the global season, and to ensure a positive outcome for the development of the game.” Meanwhile, England’s former assistant John Mitchell will square off against Eddie Jones’s side later this year as well as at the 2023 World Cup after he was appointed to Japan’s coaching staff. Mitchell left Jones’s team abruptly last summer, three months after signing a contract extension, before joining Wasps. He denied a falling-out with Jones precipitated his departure, insisting instead that the drain of international rugby was proving too much. He will join up with his fellow New Zealander Jamie Joseph as a defence coach on a part-time basis, maintaining his role with Wasps. Japan have been drawn in the same World Cup pool as England and are due at Twickenham in November. “This is a great opportunity to add value to Japan winning Test matches through growing their defence and understanding how it plays a critical part in the way we want to attack,” said Mitchell.",Sport/Sport,Six Nations organisers deny any plans for South Africa to join after 2025,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/18/six-nations-deny-south-africa-to-join-rugby-union
2/18/2022,"Donald Trump’s bad luck continues. On Thursday afternoon, Arthur Engoron, a Manhattan judge, gave the thumbs up to subpoenas issued to Trump, favorite child Ivanka, and Donald Trump Jr, by Tish James, New York’s attorney general. The court’s ruling follows a decision by Trump’s accountants to walk away from the one-term president and disavow years of financial statements issued by his company. Much as the Trump trio tried, they could not shut down James’s investigation into the Trump Organization’s business practices, which could lead to a civil suit by James. Unlike a criminal prosecution, a civil action comes with a lower burden of proof for the government. At the same time, civil lawsuits can drag on – like right into 2024. Barring a stay, Trump and his two children have been ordered to appear at deposition within 21 days.  If they tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, who knows what liability may result? On the other hand, if they invoke their right to remain silent, they will likely be portrayed as criminals. “You see, the mob takes the fifth,” Trump observed on the campaign trail in 2016. “If you’re innocent, why are you taking the fifth amendment?” Time sure flies. And if the Trump family refuses to appear at deposition or simply stays mum when grilled, they risk being charged with contempt, a distinction presently held by Steve Bannon, Trump’s White House counselor and 2016 campaign guru. At this moment, Trump must be sweating while his lenders have to be shaking their collective heads. How much is Trump worth and how bad can things get are no longer hypothetical issues. In the absence of operative financial statements, restructurings and bank-called defaults have spilled into the realm of the real. As one Trump insider confided: “Hey, this might be serious.’ Could Donald Trump [and his business] be screwed? I don’t know, but I’m not as confident as I once was in saying, ‘No.” Meanwhile, 2024 Republican presidential aspirants are likely stifling a collective smirk. Trump’s legal woes stand to broaden the Republican party’s presidential field, and for some it is downright personal. For Mike Pence, Trump’s hapless vice-president, these recent developments may well trigger a sense of schadenfreude. It wasn’t that long ago when Trump’s loyalists came with makeshift gallows for Pence as they stormed the Capitol, and Trump said nothing to deter the mob. Instead, he demanded loyalty from his No 2. As for Ron DeSantis, Florida’s governor, Trump’s troubles could not come at a better time. Trump has all but called DeSantis a coward for refusing to admit whether or not he was vaccinated. Beyond that, Florida’s recent per capita Covid mortality rate is the seventh highest in the US, and DeSantis is having a hard time denouncing neo-Nazi violence. “So what I’m going to say is these people, these Democrats who are trying to use this as some type of political issue to try to smear me as if I had something to do with that,” the Sunshine state governor declared. “We’re not playing their game.” To be sure, Trump’s Maga base would stick with him through thick-and-thin. The party’s deep-pocketed donors are a different story. Trump may have delivered them a trove of tax-cuts and ambassadorships, but he’s emotionally draining. Beyond that, his antics in the run-up to the 2020 Georgia runoff elections cost the Republicans control of the Senate. There are reasons Mitch McConnell rejects Trump’s lie that the election was stolen and is seeking to bypass the 45th president. Thursday’s ruling was scathing. At one point, the court concluded that the attorney general had uncovered “copious evidence of possible financial fraud”. Elsewhere, the judge excoriated Trump & Co for their flight to fantasy and fiction, invoking Alice in Wonderland, 1984, and Kellyanne Conway all in a single sentence. “The idea that an accounting firm’s announcement that no one should rely on a decade’s worth of financial statements that it issued based on numbers submitted by an entity somehow exonerates that entity and renders an investigation into its past practices moot is reminiscent of Lewis Carroll (‘When I use a word, Humpty Dumpty said ... it means just what I chose it to mean – neither more nor less’); George Orwell (‘War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength’); and ‘alternative facts.’” In the past, Trump managed to weather storms surrounding his finances and credibility. Trump University did not stop the ex-reality show host’s political ascent. What happens next remains to be seen. Right now, Joe Biden’s poll numbers are in the low 40s, inflation is on the loose, and Nancy Pelosi is poised to lose the speaker’s gavel. Against that tableau, Trump poses a distraction from Republican ambitions, an unwelcome detour from anticipated outcome.",Opinion/Opinion,"It’s Trump’s time to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth | Lloyd Green",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/18/its-trumps-time-to-tell-the-truth-the-whole-truth-and-nothing-but-the-truth-lloyd-green
