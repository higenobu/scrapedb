2/1/2022,"Feb. 1â€”The charge against a former Sarcoxie High School teacher for having alleged sexual contact with a student has been dismissed in light of their subsequent marriage and its impact on prosecution of the case. Baylee A. Turner, 26, was charged in February 2019 with having sexual contact with one of her male students after an investigation by the Jasper County Sheriff's Department. Turner was in the middle of her first year of teaching English at Sarcoxie High School when a case arose that she'd had sexual intercourse with a student the week of Jan. 14-21, 2019, and she resigned from her position. She had taught at the district's middle school for two years before taking the position at the high school. The Sarcoxie School Board subsequently voted to petition the state to have her teaching license revoked. Nate Dally, an assistant prosecutor in the case, told the Globe that the charge against her was being dismissed in light of the defendant having married the student in question. Dally said that because marital or spousal privilege now applies, her former student can no longer be compelled to testify against her, making the state's case exceedingly difficult to prove in court. Dally said that Turner has surrendered her state teaching license, which has been a primary concern of the prosecutor's office in the case. The probable-cause affidavit filed in the case did not provide the student's age. State law prohibits sexual contact with a student by a school district employee, volunteer or official, either elected or appointed, regardless of whether the student is a minor or of age for consensual sex. Turner is one of six young educators in Southwest Missouri to be accused in recent years of having sexual relations with a student. The charge also has been filed against teachers or student teachers in Joplin, Webb City, Monett, Diamond and McDonald County schools.","U.S./The Joplin Globe, Mo.",Teacher's marriage to student results in dismissal of charge,https://news.yahoo.com/teachers-marriage-student-results-dismissal-114600612.html

2/1/2022,"Who doesn't love jumping on a plane to Florida to escape the misery of winter? There's the sun, the warmth, the beautiful Atlantic Ocean on one side and the warm Gulf of Mexico waters on the other side. Before you dip a toe in that water, just know that Florida, once again, ranked No. 1 in unprovoked shark bites in 2021, according to Ed Killer, outdoors writer for the TC Palm. In a Jan. 24 story, Killer highlighted data released by the International Shark Attack File (ISAF). Chicks dig scars: Florida man gets bit by shark while surfing; Can't wait to get back in the water Shark bites are one of those one in a million occurrences. However, data released by the Gainesville-based organization revealed suggests that the rate may be a bit higher: 73: Unprovoked shark bites worldwide 47: Unprovoked shark bites in U.S. waters (ranked 1st) 28: Unprovoked shark bites in Florida (ranked 1st) 17: Unprovoked shark bites in Volusia County (ranked 1st) 51%: Surfing, activity when bit by a shark (ranked 1st) 11: Fatalities worldwide, 9 unprovoked Researchers with ISAF, which is a division of the University of Florida's Florida Museum of Natural History, scour media reports for news of shark bites, include reports from field researchers and verify with medical personnel the veracity of the information. The ISAF team investigated 137 alleged shark-human interactions in 2021 to confirm the 73 unprovoked bites and an additional 39 provoked bites. ""Unprovoked attacks"" are defined as incidents in which a live human is bitten in the sharkâ€™s natural habitat with no human provocation of the shark, according to the report. ""Provoked attacks"" occur when a human initiates interaction with a shark in some way, including spearfishers, divers that harassed or tried to touch sharks, people that tried to feed, unhook or remove sharks from a fishing net. Planning a trip to Florida this winter?: Be careful when you're outside Eleven fatalities are alarming, up from 10 in 2020, which was the highest since 2013. It's about twice the annual average of five, but there were two in 2019 and one in 2018. The majority of the fatalities once again occurred in Australia, where three people lost their lives. New Caledonia (2) and New Zealand (1) meant six of the fatalities took place in the Southern Pacific Ocean, where great white sharks, the largest carnivorous shark, prey on seals. One fatality occurred in the U.S. in California on Dec. 24 when an unresponsive male surfer was pulled from the surf at Morro Bay. It was the 29th unprovoked shark bite and second shark bite fatality in the state in the past 10 years. Kitesurfer Stephen Shafer, 38, of Stuart, was the most recent victim of an unprovoked and fatal shark bite in Florida. He was kite surfing Feb. 3, 2010, when he was accidentally bitten on the thigh by a suspected bull shark and died of severe blood loss. The ISAF reports the odds of being killed by a shark are lower than 1 in 3.7 million. ""This yearâ€™s increase in fatalities does not necessarily constitute a shift in the long-term trends. Fatality rates have been declining for decades, reflecting advances in beach safety, medical treatment and public awareness. While the incidence of fatal bites in 2021 was higher than is typical, we do not consider this cause for alarm. At this time, there is no evidence that the recent spike in fatalities is linked to any natural phenomena. Rather it is likely the consequence of chance, a conclusion underscored by the fact that the number of unprovoked bites is in line with recent five-year trends."" The shark bite news follows in wake of a recent column on the perils that await the unwary who set foot in the Sunshine State.

2/1/2022,"
 Former President Donald Trump is under fire - including from some of his most ardent supporters - for his preliminary endorsement of a former State Department spokesperson over a steadfast ally in a Tennessee congressional primary. In an unexpected move last week, Trump threw his support behind Morgan Ortagus, who served as a spokesperson for former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and hasn't yet announced a bid to represent Tennessee's 5th District. In doing so, Trump snubbed Republican Robby Starbuck, a conservative filmmaker who has been running for the seat since June. The former president's announcement sparked intense backlash across Republican circles, with even the most aggressive Trump boosters questioning - and in some cases outright condemning - his decision. ""Nope. Trump has this completely wrong,"" Candace Owens, a conservative commentator and staunch Trump rally, tweeted. ""@robbystarbuck is the correct pick for Tennessee's 5th district and Tennesseans have his back."" ""I endorsed @robbystarbuck months ago and I stand by my endorsement,"" Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) tweeted. ""He is the best candidate in the country right now. The MAGA movement needs him in Congress!"" In another blow to Trump's endorsement, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), one of Trump's most high-profile supporters in Congress, announced that she would back Starbuck's House bid, telling the Washington Examiner that he ""has been a champion for 'America First' for a long time."" Ortagus hasn't formally announced a campaign for Tennessee's 5th District and it's unclear whether she will ultimately move forward with a bid. Still, one former Trump aide called the early endorsement a misstep that created unnecessary tension between the former president and his most loyal supporters. ""I really see it as an unforced error,"" the aide said. ""It's not the endorsement itself that's a problem, but more that it makes it look like he's not paying attention to the people that have really stood by him through everything."" Trump's endorsement of Ortagus doesn't appear likely to clear the field either. Several potential candidates are eyeing the seat, including former Tennessee House Speaker Beth Harwell. Starbuck has also indicated that he will stay in the race. ""It's been a wild 24 hours,"" Starbuck said. ""Reporters have asked me what I'm going to do over and over again. Here's the answer: I'm going to do the thing I do best - fight for THE PEOPLE."" It's not the first time that Trump's endorsement has put him at odds with segments of his party. Some North Carolina Republicans bristled at his surprise endorsement last year of Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) in the state's Senate primary. His early support for Sean Parnell in the Pennsylvania GOP Senate primary also irked some Republicans. Parnell exited the race in November after losing a legal battle for primary custody of his three children. Still, the pushback against Trump's endorsement of Ortagus has been more overt. After Trump came out in support of a potential run by Ortagus, Greene told the Examiner that the former State Department spokesperson wasn't ""worthy"" of the former president's backing. Likewise, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), one of the most pro-Trump members of Congress, praised Starbuck's announcement that he would remain in the race, calling it ""inspiring."" While there's little doubt among Republicans that Trump remains the most popular and influential figure in the party, there's no guarantee that his endorsed candidates will emerge victorious in their respective primaries. In the Republican primary for Georgia governor, for example, Trump-endorsed former Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) has yet to pull ahead of Gov. Brian Kemp, who earned himself a place on Trump's enemies list last year after he refused to overturn the results of the presidential election in Georgia. A Quinnipiac University poll released last week showed Kemp leading Perdue by a 7-point margin. Similarly, Trump has failed to clear the Republican field in the North Carolina Senate race. Budd is still facing an aggressive primary challenge from former Gov. Pat McCrory, while another candidate, former Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), announced last week that he would remain in the Senate race despite Trump's efforts to lure him into a congressional bid instead. There are also signs that Trump may not have the same iron grip on the GOP electorate that he did when he was last on the ballot. An NBC News poll released in late January found that most Republicans - 56 percent - describe themselves as more supportive of the GOP than Trump, while 36 percent said that they see themselves as more supporters of Trump than the party itself. That's down sharply from 2020, when 54 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said they considered themselves more supportive of Trump than the party as a whole. At the time, 38 percent said they were more supportive of the GOP than Trump. Daniel Bostic, a conservative activist who has criticized Ortagus in recent days, pinned blame for the endorsement on ""a broader issue in Team Trump,"" arguing that the decision was out of step with the former president's base. ""The message to Team Trump from the populist/new-right is clear: Your supporters are not in a liberal-style cult,"" Bostic tweeted. ""They won't blindly follow you when you listen to DC consultants that undermine your promises to the base. Clean up the ship & stay on track or get out of the way.""",Politics/The Hill,Trump under fire over Tennessee primary nod,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-under-fire-over-tennessee-110022262.html
