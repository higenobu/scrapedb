2/28/2022,"Boris Johnson has said that Russian oligarchs will no longer have a hiding place for their “ill-gotten gains” in the UK under legislation being introduced in parliament this week. A new register of overseas entities is intended to stop the foreign owners of property in Britain from hiding their identity, and separate measures are expected to give some teeth to the unexplained wealth order mechanism, which until now has proved relatively ineffective. The new laws will be contained in an economic crime (transparency and enforcement) bill, which has long been called for by campaigners concerned about the UK’s reputation as a haven for dirty money. Ministers had been accused of dragging their feet over this legislation, but Johnson announced that it would be fast-tracked after the invasion of Ukraine. Some measures, though, are being held back for a further economic crime bill. “There is no place for dirty money in the UK,” Johnson said. “Those backing [the Russian president, Vladmir] Putin have been put on notice: there will be nowhere to hide your ill-gotten gains.” His announcement came as the UK government committed £40m in aid to provide vital medical supplies and other help to Ukraine. “The UK will not turn our backs in Ukraine’s hour of need,” said Johnson. “We are providing all the economic and military support we can to help those Ukrainians risking everything to protect their country.” Transparency campaigners have long complained that oligarchs have been able to park their wealth in UK property, using shell companies and other complicated legal structures to conceal the identity of the real owners. Under the new legislation, a register of overseas entities will be set up, applying retrospectively to property bought up to 20 years ago in England and Wales, and from 2014 in Scotland. Entities that do not declare the beneficial owner will face restrictions on selling the property, and people who break the rules could face up to five years in jail. The legislation will also make it easier for the authorities to use unexplained wealth orders (UWOs) – powers that enable them to confiscate criminal assets without having to prove to a criminal law standard that the property was obtained as a result of a crime being committed. UWOs have been available since January 2018, but they have only been obtained nine times in relation to four cases, and none has been secured since the end of 2019. The new rules will expand the definition of property that can be covered by an UWO, to include homes held in trust, or owned by shell companies. Law enforcement agencies will also get more time to make their case, and they will be protected against having to pay substantial costs if the attempt to secure an UWO fails. The government is also publishing a white paper on plans to give Companies House new powers to verify the identify of people setting up and running companies. This will form the basis of a future economic crime bill due to be introduced later this year. In a related move the government is also making it easier for the Office for Financial Sanctions Implementation – the body in charge of punishing banks and other organisations that do not enforce sanctions rules – to penalise offenders. On Sunday the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said there were more than 100 billionaires in Russia and that some of them would face “a rolling programme of sanctions” as officials compiled the evidence to justify their assets being frozen in the UK. “We are targeting oligarchs’ private jets, we’ll be targeting their properties, we’ll be targeting other possessions that they have,” she told Sky’s Trevor Phillips on Sunday. “There will be nowhere to hide.”",News/Politics,Russian oligarchs in UK face new laws tackling ‘dirty money’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/28/russian-oligarchs-in-uk-face-new-laws-tackling-dirty-money
2/28/2022,"The UK has the highest death rate for lung conditions in western Europe, research reveals, prompting calls from health leaders for urgent action to tackle the “national scandal”. More than 100,000 people in the UK die from conditions including asthma attacks, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia every year, according to data analysis by the charity Asthma and Lung UK. Across Europe, only Turkey has a higher respiratory death rate than the UK, analysis of data up to 2018 shows, the latest comparable data available from across the continent. The death rate is 162.7 per 100,000 people in Turkey and 134.5 in the UK. In Germany, the rate is 76.8 while in France it is 59.1 – half the UK rate. People in the UK are three times more likely to die from lung conditions than people in Finland, which has the lowest respiratory death rate (38.4) in Europe, Asthma and Lung UK said. It described the UK figures as “shameful”, and said that lung conditions had for too long been treated like the “poor relation compared with other major illnesses like cancer and heart disease”. Despite them being the third biggest cause of death in the UK, only 2% of publicly funded research is spent on lung conditions, it added. The charity is calling for more funding to research diagnostic tools and treatments, and urged ministers to bring in tougher clean air targets. It also called for improvements in the care of patients outside hospital. Even before the pandemic, significant numbers of lung patients were not receiving “basic care” from their GP services such as medicine checks and help using their inhalers, the charity said. Over the past two years, the health of thousands more has deteriorated while they waited for respiratory care, and diagnosis rates have fallen. Katy Brown, 64, a retired nursery nurse from Bristol, who was diagnosed with COPD in February 2021, said she was shocked by the lack of medical support she has received, and the poor general awareness of her condition. “I spent two years struggling to breathe and with constant chest infections, before I finally got a diagnosis of COPD,” she said. “Even now, over a year after my diagnosis, I’m still waiting for a test that will show how bad my condition is, and further treatment. “There is a lack of awareness about how serious lung conditions are and how terrifying it is to struggle to breathe. It’s like having an elephant sitting on your chest. If I’d been diagnosed with another serious condition like a heart problem, I believe my treatment and the way I was dealt with would have been completely different.” Sarah Woolnough, the chief executive of Asthma and Lung UK, urged ministers to triple funding for respiratory research to identify new ways of diagnosing and treating people with lung conditions, tackle air pollution and ensure better diagnosis and care for everyone with a lung condition. She added: “The state of lung health in the UK is shameful, with more than 100,000 people dying every year from lung conditions, the numbers of hospital admissions increasing, and air pollution causing people to develop lung conditions or making existing ones worse. “It is a national scandal that people are more likely to die from a lung condition in the UK than almost anywhere in Europe. We need urgent action now. The pandemic has brought it to people’s attention that lung conditions can and do kill and how terrifying it can be to struggle with breathlessness.”",News/Society,Campaigners call for action over UK’s ‘shameful’ lung health,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/28/campaigners-call-for-action-over-uk-shameful-lung-health
2/28/2022,"Representatives from the six major religions are among more than 1,000 faith leaders to have signed a letter to the prime minister urging him to reconsider the controversial nationality and borders bill, which goes through the report stage in the House of Lords on Monday. The leaders, representing the UK’s major faith groups, say they are “horrified and appalled about the potential repercussions” of the bill and called on Boris Johnson to make urgent changes “even at this late stage”. Signatories include the former archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, the secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, Zara Mohammed, and the senior rabbi of Masorti Judaism, Jonathan Wittenberg. The faith leaders say the 11th-hour plea is a crucial last opportunity to make changes. It states: “While there is still conflict and injustice in the world, there will always be desperate people needing to seek sanctuary from war, persecution and suffering. We cannot close our door on them, but this bill does just that. “We assert that the values that bind UK citizens together, especially those concerning human dignity and life, will be fundamentally damaged by this bill.” The letter calls on the prime minister to make substantial changes to the bill. They include abandoning the government’s plan to criminalise and restrict the rights of all people arriving in the UK seeking refugee protection outside pre-arranged schemes, including those coming via irregular routes, such as by boats or lorries. The signatories say this policy was made “without a basis in evidence or morality”. They also call on the government to urgently address the bill’s failure to establish safe routes, which would help people seeking sanctuary to reach the UK, saying that this failure fundamentally undermines its aims. They urge the prime minister to be “compassionate and ambitious” in opening schemes such as family reunion, resettlement and routes for unaccompanied refugee children in Europe. The letter calls on the prime minister to show “political leadership” and promote “compassion, human life and dignity”. Faith leaders have asked the prime minister to meet to discuss their concerns. The letter was coordinated by the ecumenical Joint Public Issues Team, made up of the Methodist Church in Britain, the Baptist Union of Great Britain and the United Reformed Church, working with the Church of Scotland. On Sunday, a cross-party group of peers also warned that plans within the bill to strip people of British citizenship without warning were against British values and would render people from ethnic minorities second-class citizens. Clause 9 of the nationality and borders bill – which exempts the government from having to give notice if it is not “reasonably practicable” to do so, or in the interests of national security, diplomatic relations or otherwise in the public interest – has attracted heavy criticism and protests outside parliament. Amendments tabled by the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, David Anderson, after discussions with the government, will reduce the circumstances in which notice can be withheld and introduce safeguards – but some peers say they do not go far enough. In a letter sent to Susan Williams, the Home Office’s Lords minister, the Conservative peers Sayeeda Warsi and Nosheena Mubarik and the crossbench peer Frances D’Souza say: “Clause 9 would create a secret power of citizenship deprivation without appeal. Far from protecting the public, this gravely threatens cherished British values of fair play and the rule of law that make UK citizenship so prized around the world. “We also risk leaving ethnic minority communities feeling second-class citizens.” A Home Office spokesperson said:“ The Nationality and Borders Bill … will deliver the most comprehensive reform in decades. “For the first time, we will be able to differentiate between those who arrive here through safe and legal routes and those who arrive here having had the opportunity to claim asylum already in a safe country.” ",News/UK news,UK faith leaders call on Boris Johnson to not ‘close door’ on refugees,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/28/uk-faith-leaders-call-on-boris-johnson-to-not-close-door-on-refugees
2/28/2022,"The NHS is piloting a new artificial intelligence pregnancy screening tool that could dramatically reduce racial disparities in baby death rates. Stillbirth and perinatal death rates are comparatively high for black and Asian babies in the UK, studies have shown. Now the Tommy’s National Centre for Maternity Improvement, led by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Midwives, has successfully designed and trialled a tool that could help end the scandal. The development comes less than a month after the Guardian revealed how a damning study – the largest of its kind – found “vast” and “widespread” inequity in every aspect of healthcare that it reviewed, and warned that it was harming the health of minority ethnic patients in the NHS. The story sparked outrage among patients, campaigners and MPs, and prompted black, Asian and minority ethnic doctors to speak out. They said health officials had “paid lip service” to racism in the NHS for years and called for “concrete” action to tackle the racial disparities in healthcare. The NHS will now begin piloting the pregnancy screening tool, aimed at tackling some of the inequalities exposed by the Guardian, in four areas across England. It follows trials involving more than 20,000 pregnant women. Researchers found huge racial disparities in pregnancy outcomes when standard screening was used. Perinatal death rates were three times higher among ethnic minority mothers (7.95 deaths per 1,000 births) than among white mothers (2.63 per 1,000 births). But when the new tool was used in conjunction with targeted care, death rates fell to about the same across all ethnic groups. Writing in BJOG, an obstetrics and gynaecology journal, the researchers concluded: “First trimester combined screening for placental dysfunction is associated with a significant reduction in perinatal deaths in black, Asian and minority ethnic women – to perinatal mortality rates equivalent to those seen in white women.” Prof Basky Thilaganathan, clinical director of the Tommy’s National Centre for Maternity Improvement, led the research team at St George’s University hospital NHS trust in London. “It’s incredibly exciting to see that changing from the standard pregnancy risk factor checklists to our new approach can directly address and almost eliminate a large source of the healthcare inequality facing black, Asian and minority ethnic pregnant women,” he said. “The current maternal risk-factor screening programme is limited and can contribute to ongoing racial inequalities – but our algorithm can account for these deficiencies, enabling us to truly personalise care rather than treating large groups in the same way, and ultimately improve pregnancy outcomes.” As well as London, the tool is now being piloted in Yorkshire, Lancashire and Surrey. “Given this new evidence, we would urge the government to support and invest in this new system, which will allow us to roll this out more widely across the UK,” added Thilaganathan. The current method for risk assessment remains largely the same as it was in the 1970s. The new tool uses AI to interpret detailed data routinely gathered during a woman’s antenatal appointments to assess their specific, personalised risk of potential complications developing during pregnancy. The new tool reduced baby deaths among mothers from ethnic minority backgrounds by 60%. Pregnant women found to be at high risk by the algorithm had extra monitoring during pregnancy, so care teams could act early to prevent problems and save babies’ lives.",Lifestyle/Life and style,NHS pilots pregnancy screening that may cut racial disparities in baby deaths,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/28/nhs-pilots-pregnancy-screening-that-may-cut-racial-disparities-in-baby-deaths
2/28/2022,"Birmingham will benefit from “the great gift of the mega-event”, said the creative officer of the Commonwealth Games at the launch of a concurrent six-month-long cultural festival. Birmingham 2022 festival will include more than 200 events from March to September across the West Midlands and will involve more than 100,000 participants, making it one of the largest cultural programmes to ever surround the games. “The great gift of the mega-event is that it comes and it gives an opportunity for everybody to work towards the same goal,” said Martin Green, the festival’s chief creative officer and former head of ceremonies at the London 2012 Olympics. “Sport is codified by its very nature, it is the same everywhere in the world. So it’s the cultural activity, the festival, the opening and closing ceremonies, that give you the sense of place, and we have a great opportunity to celebrate this extraordinary creative place we’ve got here in Birmingham.” The programme includes On Record, an album featuring 11 original songs about Birmingham by local artists including UB40, and Time Travel Tram, which will transform windows in a West Midlands Metro tram service between Wolverhampton and Birmingham into the world’s first immersive digital art installation powered by 5G. A number of events will merge the worlds of culture and sport. Outside the Box is a play that will be performed on squash courts at the University of Birmingham, while Come Bowl with Me will take a comedic look at the world of lawn bowls. The £12m festival opens on 17 March with a large-scale open-air performance in Centenary Square that combines dance, acrobatics and aerial displays with a cast of hundreds. “I really love the fact that for many years now, great sporting events also have great cultural events alongside them,” said Green. “It’s a great way to reach even more people than you would just through sport, and to see sport audiences cross over to culture.” More than 100 creative community projects have been given grants as part of the programme. They include a large-scale mural in Druids Heath and a theatre production created by Muslim teenagers in Small Heath who will gather stories from their family histories. Green added that he hoped the festival would help pioneer post-Covid cultural recovery in the country. “Our strapline for the whole festival is Let’s Go Out, we don’t want to be unclear about this,” he said. “It’s a great opportunity for people to get back to culture and back into venues, although a lot of our work is going to be outside where we know people are a bit more comfortable. “We very much want to be part of the recovery for the region, and the whole UK, because we’re a great big festival right in the heart of the UK that we know people will travel to.” The programme will also feature a number of events that tackle issues relating to the Commonwealth, which largely consists of former territories of the British empire. “We’ve got projects which explore the difficult history of the Commonwealth,” said Raidene Carter, the festival’s executive producer. “What we’ve been really keen on from day one is making sure we express all of those opinions and views, because it’s not for us to censor any artist’s view or opinion. We just knew we needed to present all sides of that feeling.”",News/UK news,Birmingham to host six-month arts festival for Commonwealth Games,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/28/birmingham-to-host-six-month-arts-festival-for-commonwealth-games
2/28/2022,"Thousands of girls as young as 11 are hiding signs of “deep distress” from their parents and teachers, according to an “alarming” report that reveals a “growing gulf” between the mental health of girls and boys. Record numbers of children are seeking access to NHS mental health services amid the pandemic as detailed in multiple studies over the last year. Now an analysis of data from 15,000 secondary pupils by Steer Education points to a worrying new trend of an increasingly stark divide between the mental health of girls and boys. Experts fear this could be a long-lasting result of the Covid crisis. Online responses from 92 state secondary schools in England from before the pandemic up to December 2021 show girls aged 11 were 30% more likely to suffer from poor mental health than boys of the same age. By 18, girls are twice as likely to experience mental health issues than boys. The number of girls who seek to hide their problems from others has also risen, with 60% of girls going to great lengths to hide feelings of unhappiness before the pandemic compared with 80% now. Girls are 33% more likely to experience poor mental health than those the same age as them before the pandemic while boys are 12% more likely to do so. The report suggests girls’ mental health is most at risk between the ages of 14 and 18. Compared with 2018, both boys and girls are 40% less trusting of others, 25% less likely to take risks and 25% less able to choose an appropriate response to life challenges. Between April 2021 and October 2021, the number of children aged under 18 needing care for issues ranging from self-harm to eating disorders had increased by 77% comparedwith the same period in 2019. Simon Antwis, Steer Education’s senior education consultant, said: “Schools are understandably deeply worried by the growing numbers of students with poor mental health. We should be particularly alarmed by the state of girls’ mental health in secondary schools – it is at a precipice and the pandemic has exacerbated a worrying trend we have seen now for many years. “The growing gulf between boys’ and girls’ mental health looks to be one of the long-lasting effects of the pandemic, with recovery from school closures taking a long time. But perhaps particularly concerning is the number of girls who are now keeping their worries and fears to themselves, making it much more difficult for their teachers to identify them as vulnerable and in need of support.”",News/Society,Thousands of girls as young as 11 in England hiding signs of ‘deep distress’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/28/thousands-girls-as-young-as-11-england-hiding-signs-deep-distress
2/28/2022,"Two years ago the idea would have been preposterous: why would anyone re-enact Robert Louis Stevenson’s novella in the dilapidated corridors and back rooms of Leith theatre while the audience watched a live screening in the auditorium? But this is 2022 and film-theatre hybrids are as current as face masks and hand gel. A shame the performance itself is so old fashioned. I’m not referring to the pastiche 1940s atmosphere created so effectively by writer and director Hope Dickson Leach in her black-and-white movie. With its stark side-lighting, gloomy backgrounds and the diffused glow of grand Edinburgh New Town windows, it has the look of a Dickens adaptation by David Lean. Add a touch of film noir and you’ve got a suitably creepy backdrop for Henry Pettigrew’s slowly disintegrating Dr Jekyll to transform into the murderous Mr Hyde. No, what feels creaky is the adaptation. This is a National Theatre of Scotland production, recorded live for its opening weekend before a cinema release, and yet it feels too buttoned-up to be theatrical. A costume drama driven by verbose Victorian gents keeping their passions just beneath the surface. That is despite Dickson Leach moving the setting from London to its spiritual home of Edinburgh and working in themes that should resonate. Lorn Macdonald’s Utterson is an upwardly mobile lawyer who hangs out in the New Club with a band of callous businessmen who exploit the city’s brewery workers while hatching a vainglorious scheme to build the National Monument of Scotland on top of Calton Hill. Today’s capitalists are no less prone to mechanisation and vanity projects, and yet this bunch of humourless villains seem to have little to do with our world. The imagery of desecrated graves and purgative leeches suggests a social order built, like Jekyll’s festering alter ego, on immoral foundations. But that is an idea that remains latent in a production in which the baddies are too blatantly corrupt while their victims are too uncomplicatedly innocent. The gothic power of the Stevenson story still exerts a hold, but it is hard to see this hybrid experiment satisfying either cineastes or theatre lovers.  Theatrical run ended. In cinemas from 27 February.
