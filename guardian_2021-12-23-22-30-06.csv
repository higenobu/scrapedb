12/23/2021,"Some people may need a fourth dose of Covid vaccine to remain protected, a government scientific adviser has said, with a decision expected shortly after the Christmas and new year holidays. Prof Adam Finn said: “I think there may well be people who received their boosters early who are in the older more vulnerable age groups who may need a further jab. That has not been decided yet. It is still under review and discussion, and we will be providing recommendations on that at some point in the new year.”  Finn, a professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol and a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), told LBC Radio on Thursday: “I think there will be people probably who will receive a fourth jab. Whether that will be everyone, I think, is still very much in doubt … We do need to see how things go through this wave and beyond.” On Tuesday, Israel became the first country to announce it would offer a fourth dose of vaccine to people over 60 and healthcare workers, in an effort to increase protection against the Omicron variant. The country’s prime minister, Naftali Bennett, urged those eligible to “go and get vaccinated” in a rollout expected over the next few days. Finn also raised the possibility of vaccinations for all children aged five to 11. He said the move was still under “very active consideration”, but that there were “very, very few severe cases” in the age group. The government had originally introduced vaccination for older children to prevent disruption to education and reduce transmission rates. With the Omicron variant, however, “the ability of the vaccines to do that will be reduced”, he said. A government-backed study published on Wednesday found that Covid infections among five to 11-year-olds were three times more prevalent than in the general population. React-1, a joint study by Imperial College London and Ipsos Mori, found an estimated 4.47% of primary school-aged children had the virus, compared with 1.41% across the population as a whole. The JCVI recommended vaccinations for about 330,000 five to 11-year-olds on Wednesday. It updated its advice after the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency approved the move after a robust review of safety data. A low-dose version of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will be offered to those in age group who are clinically vulnerable, or who are a household contact of someone who is immunosuppressed. They will be offered a primary course of vaccination, which is typically two doses.",News/World news,"Some people in UK may need four Covid jabs to stay protected, expert says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/some-people-in-uk-may-need-four-covid-jabs-to-stay-protected-expert-says
12/23/2021,"Hundreds of mourners gathered at Liverpool’s Catholic cathedral on Thursday morning for the funeral of 12-year-old Ava White, who was stabbed to death after the city’s Christmas lights switch-on. It was a grey, wet Liverpool day but there was lots of colour as many people arrived in purples, pinks, reds and blues – anything but black at the request of the family.  Her coffin, which had made its way to Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral on a horsedrawn carriage, was covered in family photographs of the 12-year-old. Ava was with friends at Liverpool’s Christmas lights switch-on when she was attacked on 25 November. She was taken to Alder Hey children’s hospital where she died from her wounds. Police have said they believe a “verbal argument” took place which resulted in Ava suffering “catastrophic injuries”. Archbishop Malcolm McMahon said at the funeral Ava was a “popular, loving young person” who he was told “would try anything once” and “did not fear anything”. She loved going on holiday, mixed martial arts, singing, dancing and making TikTok videos, he said. He said: “Ava was loved by so many people, undoubtedly heaven will be a happier place.” A round of applause broke out as the coffin was carried out of the cathedral to continue its journey to Anfield Crematorium. Afterwards McMahon talked of the “tragic and heartbreaking” loss of Ava which “brought deep shock and sadness to everyone in the city. “The turnout today at the cathedral shows the unity and love that we have in Liverpool for Ava and her family. It was an incredibly moving and emotional funeral which was a fitting tribute to Ava. “We continue to pray for Ava, her family, her friends, her teachers and the community.” Pupils and staff from Ava’s school, Notre Dame Catholic College, and staff from her former school, Holy Trinity Catholic primary school, were in attendance. After Ava’s death, her father, Robert Martin, issued a statement thanking people for their ongoing support through what was a “devastating” time. “Thank you to every one of you for your kind messages and donations. “As Ava’s family we are completely devastated and heartbroken by what has happened and we ask that you respect our privacy at this time and allow us to grieve as a family.” A vigil was held in Liverpool city centre, close to where the incident took place, on 4 December. Hundreds of balloons, some in the shape of the letter A, were released simultaneously and Astrid Smith sang John Lennon’s Imagine. A coroner last week opened an inquest into Ava’s death at which he said she died as a result of a stab wound to the neck. A 14-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared at Liverpool crown court on 29 November charged with her murder. He is expected to face trial next year.",News/UK news,"Funeral held for stabbed girl, 12, in Liverpool",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/23/funeral-held-for-stabbed-girl-12-in-liverpool-ava-white

12/23/2021,"The US chipmaker Intel has apologised for telling its suppliers not to source products or labour from Xinjiang, a province that human rights groups and governments including the US allege uses forced labour, after facing a backlash across China. Intel, which derives more than a quarter of its $80bn (£60bn) in annual revenues from the Chinese market, apologised to the people of China and its local partners on Thursday for telling suppliers to avoid the region in accordance with restrictions imposed by “multiple governments”.  “We apologise for the trouble caused to our respected Chinese customers, partners and the public,” Intel said in a post on the social media site WeChat, hours after its annual letter to suppliers was made public, prompting fury across China. “To clarify, the paragraph about Xinjiang in the letter is only for expressing the original intention of compliance and legality, not its intention or position.” The US and Amnesty International have accused China of widespread human rights abuses in Xinjiang against the province’s majority Muslim Uyghur population, including forced labour, mass internment and torture, which Beijing denies. Earlier this month, Intel published its annual letter to suppliers saying that it had been “required to ensure that its supply chain does not use any labour or source goods or services” from Xinjiang. The letter, which is available in English and Chinese, went viral on Chinese social media this week. The Global Times, a Beijing-backed nationalist tabloid, accused Intel of biting “the hand that feeds it” and said the move was “absurd”. “What we need to do is to make it increasingly expensive for companies to offend China so their losses outweigh their gains,” the newspaper said in an editorial. The Chinese pop starWang Junkai posted on his official Weibo microblog that he would no longer serve as an Intel brand ambassador, adding that “national interests exceed everything”. Multinational companies have come under pressure as they aim to comply with Xinjiang-related trade sanctions while continuing to operate in China, one of their biggest markets. Brands including Nike and H&M have come under pressure in China for voicing concerns about the treatment of Uyghurs, or trying to eliminate Xinjiang from their supply chains. Earlier this month, the US senate passed a new law barring imports from China’s north-western region unless businesses can prove they were produced without forced labour. The US has also announced a diplomatic boycott of Beijing’s Winter Olympic Games next year in protest against the alleged abuses. The Global Times said in its editorial that multinationals “should be able to endure, properly handle and balance pressure from all parties”.",News/Technology,Intel apologises to China over Xinjiang products and labour directive,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/23/intel-apologises-to-china-over-xinjiang-products-and-labour-directive
12/23/2021,"People crossing the Channel in small boats to claim asylum could be tagged on arrival under Home Office plans, it has emerged. The home secretary, Priti Patel, is expected to announce the plan early in the new year as part of her overhaul of the immigration system.  According to a government source familiar with the plan, ministers believe that making working-age people wear tags while their asylum claims are processed would make it harder for them to work illegally during this period – reducing the UK’s “pull factor”. Ministers also believe that tags would stop people absconding during the application process. The government wants more people whose asylum applications fail to be removed from the country, although absconding is only one factor and there are significant legal reasons why removal numbers are low, including the UK’s post-Brexit withdrawal from the Dublin agreements, which enabled people to be returned to EU countries they had travelled through. More than 27,000 people have arrived in the UK this year by crossing the Channel on small boats, up from 8,500 in 2020, and Patel has faced strong criticism, particularly from within the Conservative party, for not doing more to curb these numbers. Under her “new plan for immigration”, linked to the nationality and borders bill, which begins its passage through the House of Lords in January, the Home Office wants to make illegal entry into the UK harder, simplify and speed up the processing of asylum claims and remove more people whose claims fail. The plan to tag people whose claims are being considered, first reported in the Sun, is likely to be piloted before being rolled out more widely. Sources claim that new legislation is not required because powers to require asylum seekers to wear tags are already available. Under the “new plan for immigration”, the Home Office wants to ensure all asylum seekers are accommodated in reception centres, instead of hotels, while their claims are processed. It is understood that tagging would be part of this, with asylum seekers subject to restrictions on their movements. One source argued that making it more difficult to work illegally would protect people from modern slavery-type exploitation. In the autumn, in response to growing concern about the number of people crossing the Channel on small boats, Boris Johnson asked Steve Barclay, the Cabinet Office minister, to review if more could be done across government to address the issue. The tagging plan may be one of the first outcomes to be announced from this process. Last month the Home Office admitted that only five people crossing the Channel on small boats had been returned to Europe this year. On Thursday, the Home Office declined to comment on the tagging plan. But it did refer journalists to a comment from Tom Pursglove, an immigration minister, who said: “The nationality and borders bill will make it a criminal offence to knowingly arrive in the UK illegally and introduce life sentences for those who facilitate illegal entry.”",News/UK news,Cross-Channel asylum seekers could be tagged under Home Office plans,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/23/cross-channel-asylum-seekers-could-be-tagged-under-home-office-plans
12/23/2021,"The EU’s top diplomat has accused Russia of creating “a severe deterioration of the security situation in Europe” while calling for dialogue to avoid conflict in Ukraine. Josep Borrell, the EU high representative for foreign policy, was responding to Vladimir Putin’s proposals for security guarantees for Russia that would effectively rewrite the post-cold-war order.  Russia last week put forward a list of highly controversial security demands, including a ban on Ukraine entering Nato and a limit to troop and arms deployments on the alliance’s eastern flank – effectively returning Nato forces to where they were in 1997, before an eastward expansion. The Kremlin’s proposals were handed to the US and Nato, but the EU is part of the west’s co-ordinated response to Russia’s military buildup on the border with Ukraine. On Wednesday Borrell spoke to the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, where they “took note” of Russia’s proposals, according to an EU account of the call. “They underlined that any further military aggression against Ukraine will have massive consequences and severe costs,” the EU statement said. A US state department spokesperson used similar language to describe the exchange: “They emphasised the need for coordinated action to support Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and reaffirmed that any further Russian military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences for the Russian Federation.” Russia has massed around 100,000 troops on its side of the border with Ukraine, while Putin has escalated his rhetoric, sparking fears that he is looking for a pretext for an invasion. Earlier this month the Russian president said war in eastern Ukraine – where Ukrainian government troops have been fighting Russian-backed rebels since – looked like genocide. EU leaders have stopped short of detailing specific sanctions against Russia, but last week agreed that “any further military aggression against Ukraine will have massive consequences and severe cost in response”. Nato has called on Russia to withdraw its forces and said its relationship with Ukraine is a matter between Kiev and the 30 members of the transatlantic security alliance. In his statement on Putin’s security proposals, Borrell said Europe’s security was under threat. Listing the Kremlin’s recent foreign policy adventures, from Russia’s annexation of Crimea, to its role in eastern Ukraine, actions in the Georgian breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Transnistria and support for Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, Borrell said Russia’s actions had “led to a severe deterioration of the security situation in Europe”. “The EU believes that dialogue, negotiation and cooperation are the only means to overcome disputes and bring peace,” Borrell said, citing the need to respect international commitments, including through the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. The OSCE announced on Wednesday an agreement between Russia and Ukraine to restore a ceasefire. “I was delighted that participants expressed their strong determination to fully adhere to the measures to strengthen the ceasefire agreement of 22 July 2020,” said Mikko Kinnunen, an OSCE special envoy in Ukraine. “This is of utmost significance for the people living on both sides of the contact line.” The OSCE has an observer mission in Donbas and has reported five times as many daily violations of the ceasefire this month compared with December 2020. Ceasefire violations include explosions and the firing of weapons, which monitors have recorded despite restrictions on their movement and jamming of GPS signals on OSCE drones. The agreement was reached during a meeting of officials from Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE – known as the Trilateral Contact Group – and representatives of the Kremlin-backed, self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics. Many ceasefires have been agreed and collapsed since the conflict began in 2014. More than 14,000 people have been killed, while the region’s economy has been devastated.",News/World news,Russia causing ‘severe deterioration’ of European security – EU,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/eu-russia-european-security-josep-borrell
12/23/2021,"Newcastle United have written to the Premier League requesting “clarity” regarding a series of recent contentious refereeing decisions which have gone against them during defeats against Manchester City, Liverpool and Leicester City. At Leicester a penalty was awarded against Eddie Howe’s side despite Brendan Rodgers’ midfielder James Maddison appearing to have initiated the contact; Diogo Jota scored for Liverpool at a moment when Newcastle’s Isaac Hayden was down with a head injury; and last Sunday against City, Ederson seemed to clearly foul Newcastle’s Ryan Fraser but no penalty was awarded.  “All we’re asking for is some clarity on the decisions and how the officials have come to those decisions,” said Howe, whose relegation-threatened side have won only one game all season and face Manchester United at St James’ Park on Monday night. “That’s all we’re asking for to help the processes for the future. Those decisions have influenced the results, I’ve got no doubt about that. “There’s definitely a feeling of injustice among our group. There’s been disbelief in the games at a few of the things that have gone against us. When VAR was first introduced I think it was used regularly to try to get the right decision. But I think the use of it has been diluted and I don’t see it effectively intervening as much as it did in a positive way. The use of VAR as far as we’re concerned has definitely been a bit contentious.” While Howe hopes to make referees think twice before declining to offer his side the benefit of the doubt he has also questioned Newcastle’s “unfair” schedule which dictates that his players will fulfil their fourth fixture in just over a fortnight against Manchester United but the visitors will be playing for the first time since 11 December. Whereas Manchester United are one of a number of sides to have seen fixtures postponed by Covid outbreaks among their squad, other teams, including Newcastle, have soldiered on after remaining largely virus-free. Along the way Howe’s side have collected injuries at a time when two relegation rivals, Burnley and Watford, have been able to give some key players a fortnight’s rest. Leeds were in a similar position to Newcastle but on Thursday their Boxing Day game was called off. “For the benefit of the league you want everybody to be treated the same and you want a level playing field,” said Howe. “With the postponements some teams have not been playing while others, like us, have played. You also have January to think about. If teams have a fixture backlog and those games get moved to February or March they can then play new January signings in them. “I think it’s questionable whether the current situation has been fair to everybody. Moving one of our games would be nice because we’re in a position where we’re playing a lot and our players are fatigued and carrying injuries. “The trouble when players carry injuries into games is that it only makes your squad smaller. That’s what we’re currently faced with and it’s proving very difficult for us.”",Sport/Football,‘Feeling of injustice’: Howe speaks out as Newcastle contact league over referees,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/23/eddie-howe-newcastle-contact-premier-league-over-referees-feeling-of-injustice
12/23/2021,"The UK public’s appetite for eating out has plunged to its weakest since the spring amid growing evidence of the impact of the Omicron variant on the hospitality sector during its crucial pre-Christmas period. The number of seated diners fell by 14 percentage points in the week ending 20 December to 88% of the level in the same period of 2019, before the start of the pandemic, according to the weekly digest of flash economic indicators from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).  Using data from the online restaurant booking site OpenTable and other sources, the ONS said Britons were eating out less and working from home more in response to rising infection rates and the government’s plan B measures. Amid widespread reports of bookings being cancelled, the drop in the number of diners in the latest week was the sharpest since early September and the lowest level since restaurants reopened indoors in England, Scotland and Wales in May after last winter’s lockdown. It was also the first time the weekly comparison with 2019 has dropped below 100% since May. Restaurants in London have been especially hard hit by Omicron, with the number of diners in the latest week falling 18 points to 57% of the level in the same period of 2019. In Manchester, despite an eight-point drop on the week, the number of diners stood at 104% of the level in the run-up to Christmas 2019. The ONS said the number of firms reporting staff working from home in the latest two weeks had risen by two points to 14%, with a marked impact on businesses reliant on consumers. Transactions at Pret a Manger sandwich outlets were lower in the week ending 16 December than in January 2020 in six of seven urban locations, with London again the most affected city. While trade in regional towns remained above pre-pandemic levels, sales in the capital dropped by 29 points to barely 50% of the January 2020 level. The ONS report showed retailers doing less badly than restaurants, with footfall in the latest week 81% of its 2019 level – a drop of only one percentage point. Credit and debt card payment purchases were up 4% on a year ago. Earlier this week, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced an emergency £1bn package to help businesses struggling with the impact of Omicron. Meanwhile, analysts are warning that the economy is likely to contract in December even if restrictions in England remain unchanged. Andrew Goodwin, a UK economist at the consultancy firm Oxford Economics, said: “Though the government has opted to defer a decision on introducing further restrictions until after Christmas, it seems likely that a mix of greater consumer caution and reduced mobility will ensure that the UK’s GDP falls in December.”",News/Business,UK loses appetite for pre-Christmas dining out because of Omicron,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/23/uk-loses-appetite-for-pre-christmas-dining-out-omicron
12/23/2021,"Britain is full. That vague but powerful assumption has shaped so much of our politics. From the Brexit campaign with its “breaking point” poster of a queue of migrants and refugees, and border-fixated home secretaries from Jack Straw to Priti Patel, to the regular immigration panics spread by newspapers to voters, the idea that these small islands have reached their maximum viable population has become hugely influential. It’s a convenient situation for the right. Blame for congestion and strained public services can be placed on population growth and migrants, rather than on our profoundly unequal patterns of land ownership and use or Conservative cuts in state spending. But the idea that Britain is full – or too full already – also appeals more widely: to some environmentalists, to people who like peace and quiet, and dislike cities or new housing developments, or think that being British is a privilege that needs protecting. A fear of overcrowding is deep in our island psyche.  And over recent decades the UK population has undeniably changed quite dramatically. Between 1981 and the beginning of the pandemic, it grew by more than a fifth, or about 12 million people. Meanwhile, the number of people visiting the UK also surged, almost doubling during the first two decades of this century. So many factors contributed to these increases – from globalisation and the end of the cold war to EU membership and improvements in life expectancy – that they seemed unstoppable. In British cities, where most of the influx took place, railway stations, restaurants, museums, schools and train carriages all got bigger. How underpopulated those spaces have often been since the arrival of Covid-19. Lockdowns and anxiety about the virus do not fully explain the transformation. Far from having too many people, Britain may be in the early stages of a population decline – and it may last longer than the pandemic. One recent Friday evening in central London, with Omicron yet to spread much and the Christmas shopping and drinking season theoretically in full swing, the usually packed pavements of Oxford Street, Regent Street and Piccadilly Circus were dotted with people walking unobstructed in small groups, surrounded by empty space. As absent as the usual crowds were the usual foreign accents. The tourism body VisitBritain expects that the number of foreign visitors this year will be more than 80% below its pre-pandemic figure – a much steeper fall than in comparable destinations such as France or Spain. For Britain, where tourism is the fifth-largest sector of the economy and the source of a lot of national self-confidence, this is a big change – even if it has been masked in places by an increase in domestic visitors. Yet the suspension of our status as a leading destination may be less significant than what is happening to our more permanent population. In 2020 alone, according to the Economics Statistics Centre of Excellence, the number of UK residents may have dropped by “more than 1.3 million” – the largest fall since the second world war. Other demographers estimate that there was a smaller fall or a tiny increase. But all agree that thanks to our terrible Covid death toll, a drop in the birthrate, and fewer EU and non-EU migrants after Brexit, the UK’s population boom has come to an end. If and when the pandemic fades, there is little confidence that this growth will resume. Even before Covid, the birthrate was falling, and the long modern rise in life expectancy was stalling – the latter almost certainly connected to Conservative austerity. Through Brexit and other policies, the Tories effectively promised a less crowded and less cosmopolitan country, and that is what they have created. During the first lockdown, some people of all political persuasions relished the emptier, calmer streets. And with fewer foreign tourists, famous British places have felt more like meaningful national monuments and less like theme park attractions. Even the pompous plaza in front of Buckingham Palace had an atmosphere – a sort of stoical Victorian grandeur – when I found it almost deserted at dusk one day last summer. But as with lockdowns, the appeal of this quieter country is wearing off. This year’s disruptive labour shortages are a sign that depopulation and consumerism are not completely compatible. In the longer term, we may also discover that living in a shrinking or static population is psychologically unsettling, even alarming. The last time Britain’s population stopped growing, in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, it was widely seen as a sign of national decline. When fewer people are choosing to live in a country, or to have children in it, that country feels less confident, and its prospects contract. For now at least, many Conservative voters may not mind. Lots of them grew up in a postwar Britain with considerably fewer people, so they may feel that a return to those population levels is a restoration of the natural order. Alternatively, their opinions may not be that connected to social realities. During the Brexit referendum, the political journalist Stephen Bush visited Hull, and found that “the issue that moves [Brexit] voters” was “Britain is full”. Since the 1960s, the city’s population had actually fallen by a seventh. Yet Hull still voted leave by two to one. Conversely, the most pro-EU and pro-immigration parts of Britain are often the most densely populated, such as inner London. Many Britons who have actually experienced life on a crowded island seem to like it. It’s possible that the current population slump, like that of the 1970s and 1980s, will turn out to be temporary, ended by changes in economic and political conditions. But if it doesn’t, life on our archipelago at the edge of Europe will gradually become very different. One day, we may look back with nostalgia at when Britain felt full.
