3/15/2022,"An “ark” refuge is being created by the National Trust to help save one of the UK’s most endangered native species from extinction. The white-clawed crayfish is the UK’s only indigenous crayfish but the population has been almost wiped out because of the introduction of a bigger American species in the 1970s. The trust on Tuesday said it wanted to do its bit to help by creating the refuge in an old cattle drinking hole at the Wallington estate in Northumberland. It will move up to 100 of the crustaceans from the River Wansbeck, which runs through the estate, to the site, where it is hoped they will breed. Matthew Fitch, the National Trust ranger at Wallington, said the white-clawed crayfish was “on a knife-edge”. He added: “It’s so important we shore up the healthy populations, like the one we’re fortunate to have here on the Wansbeck, as quickly as we can to make sure it doesn’t vanish from our rivers altogether.” Fitch said the site would be a safe haven “but also contribute to the long-term protection of the animal, as the crayfish that are kept here can in theory be used to repopulate other waterbodies”. Populations of white-clawed crayfish have more than halved across Europe in recent decades. In the UK an estimated 70% of the population has been lost. The losses can be traced back to the introduction of the American signal crayfish, a bigger species introduced to Europe in the 1970s as a restaurant delicacy. They were deliberately introduced to British waterways in 1976 by a government that hoped they would be an export money spinner, supplying the lucrative Scandinavian market. Grants were made available for estate owners and others to take part. The consequences have been devastating for indigenous crayfish. As well as outcompeting smaller crayfish for food and habitat, the interloper often carries a plague that is harmless to itself but can wipe out other species of crayfish in weeks. The Wallington estate is, at 13,500 acres, the largest estate in the care of the National Trust. Rangers at Wallington have spent 15 months diligently taking water samples and surveying to make sure the project will succeed. The 200-year-old cattle drinking hole is fed by a spring, with the water flowing over barriers before it reaches the Wansbeck, meaning the chances of signal crayfish or plague entering are low. Around 250,000 visitors a year go to Wallington. As well as the marvellous Pre-Raphaelite artworks in the house people will soon be able to see a display tank of white-clawed crayfish in the property’s reception area. Ian Marshall, who is the Environment Agency’s national lead on white-clawed crayfish, said Northumberland had some of the best populations. “They are vital to our ecology, helping to keep our waterways clean and providing a source of food for other native species. “The Northumberland Crayfish Partnership is working hard to better protect them and this brilliant project at Wallington is one of many big plans to make 2022 the best year yet for the recovery of native crayfish across the region.”",News/Environment,National Trust creates Northumberland ‘ark’ to protect endangered crayfish,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/15/national-trust-creates-northumberland-ark-to-protect-endangered-crayfish
3/15/2022,"The Scottish government must raise its ambition to adapt to the climate crisis immediately, an influential advisory body has warned, as a report sets out how the Scottish National party’s “vision” for building resilience has not translated into “real-world action”. The Climate Change Committee, which advises all the UK’s governments on climate policies, said Scottish government action to adapt to wetter winters, rising sea levels and extreme weather events such as the recent Storm Arwen, had “stalled”, and that this posed risks to people, infrastructure and business. It is the second critical intervention by the committee in the past six months, and comes after first minister Nicola Sturgeon agreed an ambitious partnership deal with the Scottish Greens last summer and enjoyed significant media coverage at Glasgow’s Cop26 summit in Glasgow last November. Last December, the committee warned that Scotland would miss its targets to cut carbon emissions because government policies are too vague and weak. It said that although Sturgeon’s government had the most far-reaching pledges of any in the UK, the policies needed to hit them were absent. Tuesday’s 174-page report to the Holyrood parliament sets out how, over the past 30 years, the average temperature in Scotland has risen by 0.5C, winters have become 5% wetter and the sea level around the coast has increased by up to 3cm each decade. The chairwoman of the CCC adaptation committee, Julia King, Baroness Brown of Cambridge, said work on adapting to changes in the climate was the “poor relation” of the net zero targets. King said the committee commended the Scottish government on its vision for a climate-ready Scotland, “but the reality is that action is not happening at the scale or pace required”. The report found “no credible plan” to adapt farmland habitats – which make up 73% of the land area of Scotland – to a changing climate; rates of peatland restoration “falling well short” of government targets; “insufficient” plans to adapt infrastructure, such as ports, airports and telecoms. It added that the gap in planning how to maintain a weather-resilient energy system “increasingly threatens the delivery of greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets”. Meanwhile, the report found a “critical gap” in how policies were monitored and evaluated, meaning key developments in climate risk were “largely unknown”, while there was little clarity – and thus a lack of accountability – over which government ministers were responsible for delivering these commitments. The CCC report underlined that “most of the levers” needed to implement change were “within the hands of the Scottish government”. Cabinet secretary for net zero, energy and transport, Michael Matheson, said his government welcomed critical scrutiny, and accepted that “more needs to be done”. “This is a global challenge and we are not alone in needing to accelerate progress”. Liam Kerr, Scottish Conservative minister for net zero, energy and transport, said: “For all the SNP’s lofty rhetoric on the environment – and Nicola Sturgeon’s grandstanding at Cop26 – Scotland is miles behind where we should be”. “In just the last few months, we have seen the damage and devastation caused by severe winter storms and the SNP’s belated response – this cannot be allowed to continue.” Scottish Labour net zero spokesman, Colin Smyth, said the report was a “damning indictment of the SNP-Green government’s atrocious record on the environment”. “The Greens are no longer worthy of the name, now that they’ve abandoned the last of their principles to prop up this failing government,” he said.",News/UK news,"Scotland not adapted to climate crisis, says advisory committee",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/15/scotland-not-adapted-to-climate-crisis-says-advisory-committee
3/15/2022,"It is only three years ago, having just watched France throw away a 16-0 interval lead to Wales in Paris, that the former Les Bleus flanker and multiple grand slam winner Olivier Magne delivered a few home truths. “We won’t win anything with the current generation,” he hissed. “When I hear some players after games, it’s never their fault. At the first hitch, they collapse psychologically. This generation has been associated with defeat for too long … they are deeply traumatised.” Magne, we now know, was two-thirds right. France’s national team did indeed require a new broom but, ultimately, the key has been better coaching and smarter man-management. Just ask Damian Penaud, Romain Ntamack, Uini Atonio, Paul Willemse, Julien Marchand, Demba Bamba, Grégory Alldritt and Gaël Fickou. All were part of the same matchday squad which collapsed so spectacularly in 2019 against the Welsh. Now they are potentially pivotal figures in a France squad seeking to conquer all-comers at next year’s Rugby World Cup. This underlines the slim margins separating a bunch of serial losers from a roomful of heroic figures on the brink of something special. Victory over England on Saturday would deliver only the second French grand slam since 2005 and their 10th ever. Having collected four in eight years across the turn of the millennium, this year’s upbeat campaign has been a long time coming. Comparing or rating grand slams is often invidious. The beauty is in the eye of the beholder, with the Irish clean sweep of 2018 every bit as praiseworthy as, say, the Welsh ones of 2012 and 2019. In France, though, there is a lively salon debate to be had if Fabien Galthié’s side prevail this weekend. Are the modernists of French rugby now superior to the classical old masters? Or will it take back-to-back grand slams and a World Cup triumph for the current team to be admitted to the pantheon? In the Breakdown’s experience of all-conquering French champion sides, there are three main rivals for the label of best ever. Has there ever been a more daunting pack, for instance, than the 1977 vintage that steamrollered all before it, spearheaded by the mighty props Robert Paparemborde and Gérard Cholley, with Jean-François Imbernon and Michel Palmié blocking out the light in the second row? Behind them was the equally massive Jean-Pierre Bastiat at No8 with Jean-Pierre Rives and Jean-Claude Skrela on the flanks. The side was so settled that the same 15 players were used for the entire championship. Buried in the small print, though, is the fact they only beat England 4-3 at Twickenham, with the England full-back, Alastair Hignell, missing five of his six penalty attempts. As Hignell ruefully recalled to the Guardian last year, the French still toast him even now. “In 2017, a French journalist came round to interview me … When the piece appeared the headline was: ‘The 16th man of the French XV!’” Then there was the 1998 side, who rivalled Martin Johnson’s England in Dublin from 2003 in terms of the convincing flourish with which they clinched a second grand slam in as many seasons. With Thomas Castaignède at No 10 and Galthié as well as the current team manager, Raphael Ibañez, both involved, they took Wales apart 51-0 in a dazzling display at Wembley, having also stuck a half century of points on Scotland. No one since has managed back-to-back grand slams, although the feat did arrive at a turbulent time in northern hemisphere rugby history. The previous autumn France lost 52-10 to South Africa in Paris, with European players having not fully adjusted to the fitness requirement of professionalism. There is an argument, therefore, that the most satisfying French grand slam of all was completed in 2004 when Bernard Laporte’s team saw off Clive Woodward’s reigning world champions England 24-21 in Paris, having led 21-3 at half-time. Again Magne was hugely influential with Serge Betsen and Imanol Harinordoquy completing a formidable back row. After the game Laporte could not resist lobbing a juicy titbit to the Anglo-Saxon press: “I had messages from the coaches of New Zealand and Australia wanting us to beat the English,” he said. “Everybody is fed up of England winning … we have given pleasure to the whole world.” Since then, however, only the team of 2010 – Thierry Dusautoir, Sébastien Chabal, Morgan Parra, François Trinh-Duc et al – have done likewise. Every day before the England game, on their bus journey to training, they sang I Gotta Feeling by Black Eyed Peas (“Tonight’s gonna be a good night …”) but also had a gruff defence coach, Dave Ellis, to keep them on the straight and narrow. The following year they reached the World Cup final, missing out to the All Blacks in Auckland by a single point. Not many of the aforementioned teams, though, possessed the enviable balance France now have. Ntamack and Penaud are threatening to have even more illustrious Test careers than their famous fathers Émile and Alain, while Melvyn Jaminet kicks goals with the same side-eye accuracy as Jonny Wilkinson. Up front, at their best, the deft inter-passing between the forwards is wonderful to behold while the lineout wobbles of Cardiff were all the more notable for their rarity. And we have not even mentioned their kingpin, Antoine Dupont, who will be looking to remind England’s young half-backs of the current European pecking order. Nothing can be guaranteed on the concluding weekend of a tight Six Nations but this young French side could soon put some illustrious names in the shade.

3/15/2022,"The EU has imposed sanctions on the boss of anti-war protester Marina Ovsyannikova at Russia’s Channel One along with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich for his “very good relations with Vladimir Putin”. Konstantin Ernst, the chief executive of the state-controlled TV channel, and Chelsea football club’s owner are among 15 individuals newly targeted by the EU. Along with the extended list of individuals on whom asset freeze and travel bans are imposed, to be published later on Tuesday, the EU is also banning investments in Russia’s energy sector, as well as exports of finished steel products and most luxury goods, such as precious stones, clothes and carpets, over the value of €300 (£252) and cars worth more than €50,000. There is also a complete transaction ban with nine Russian state-owned enterprises and the EU has prohibited the rating of the country and its companies by credit rating agencies. Brussels has made a discernible effort to squeeze individuals and entities that have aided Putin in spreading his message about the invasion of Ukraine. RT and Sputnik have already been prohibited from broadcasting within the 27 member states and the inclusion of Ernst and a presenter, Artyom Sheynin, in the EU list has added poignancy after the protest by his colleague on Monday evening. Ovsyannikova, an editor at Channel One, had burst on to the set of the live broadcast of the nightly news, shouting: “Stop the war. No to war.” She also held a sign saying: “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” It was signed in English: “Russians against the war.” She has been arrested and her whereabouts are unknown. The EU’s legal text on its fourth round of sanctions describes Ernst as being “responsible for organising and disseminating anti-Ukrainian propaganda of the Russian authorities”. It notes that he has “also received the highest state awards, including the orders For Services to the Fatherland, the Order of Friendship, letters of appreciation and prizes from the government and the president of the Russian Federation, as well as the medal ‘To the participant in the military operation in Syria’”. Sheynin, who worked alongside Ovsyannikova, is said to be a “a Russian propagandist and presenter of talkshow Vremya Pokazhet (“Time will tell”) on the state-controlled TV Channel One”. The text says: “He made statements in support of the illegal annexation of Crimea and recognition of the independence of the so-called Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics. In his live broadcasts, Sheynin promotes ethnic hatred between Ukrainians and Russians, denies the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and slanders Putin’s opponents in Russia.” It adds: “Talking about 24 February 2022, the day of the Russian full-scale unjustified military aggression against Ukraine, Sheynin stated that the Russian operation in Ukraine was inevitable and its purpose was to force the Ukrainian authorities to maintain peace.” Also included on the list is Tigran Khudaverdyan, the executive director of Yandex, the Russian-language search engine and web portal. Yandex’s former head of news, Lev Gershenzon, accused the company earlier this month of being a “key element in hiding information” from Russians about the war in Ukraine. According to the EU, the company has been “warning Russian users looking for news about Ukraine on its search engine of unreliable information on the internet, after the Russian government threatened Russian media over what they publish”. Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign affairs chief, said: “As President Putin’s war against Ukrainian people continues, so does our resolve to support Ukraine and cripple the financing of Kremlin’s war machinery. “This fourth package of sanctions is another major blow to the economic and logistic base upon which Russia relies on to carry out the invasion of Ukraine. The aim of the sanctions is that President Putin stops this inhuman and senseless war.”Further details about the EU’s sanctions will be published in the Journal of the European Union later today.",News/World news,EU hits Roman Abramovich with sanctions in new action against Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/eu-roman-abramovich-sanctions-russia-tv-protester
3/15/2022,"I’m a woman and have known that I’m bisexual since I was 16, but I’ve only ever had relationships with men. I’m now almost 30 and in a committed relationship of more than five years. I love my partner, but when I think about the eventuality of marriage, a mortgage and children, I feel a small surge of sadness: have I missed the chance to explore my sexuality? I thought it would happen at university, or, at the very least, that I’d be able to truly be myself (openly attracted to women). Yet I’ve never been one for putting myself out there. Before I knew it, I was in my final year and I had started dating my now long-term partner. I’m left with not so much a conundrum, but a feeling of loss for something I never had. The ultimate question: do you think it’s best to just accept I’ve missed my chance, and be grateful for the committed relationship I have? Only you can decide what is best for you, and you could not be blamed for choosing safety and stability over sexual exploration. However, you would not be asking the current question were you not deeply troubled by your feelings. Perhaps there is a way for you to try connecting with a woman to whom you are attracted – in order to explore the erotic possibilities in a non-physical way ie without sabotaging your primary relationship. I am not suggesting you have an affair (although some people in your position might choose such a course of action in pursuit of self-discovery) but rather, that you open yourself a bit more to attractions and erotic signals that you have previously avoided. In allowing yourself to be more open in this way, you might learn whether your desire for women can remain a fantasy or not.

3/15/2022,"The Ukrainian port of Odesa has fallen silent, revellers in its city centre replaced by blockades and tank traps, its famous Potemkin steps empty and statues protected by sandbags, waiting to see if the bombs that have fallen across most of the other great cities of the country will land here too. A Russian-speaking cultural and strategic hub on the Black Sea, it is clear that Moscow’s invasion plan included trying to seize control of this historic city. Yet 20 days into the war on Ukraine, its streets are undamaged by explosives, though emptied by the tide of war. “It takes a very long time to get used to such silence in the city,” said Daniel Salem, now an officer in the national guard. He ran four bars and restaurants in Odesa until the end of February, and still lives in the city centre. “Every time I come out I imagine I can hear the voices of people, I think I see them. This is a place that is always partying, this main street is full of people dancing, having fun.” Officials estimate that at least 60% of Odesa’s population have left for safer parts in the east, or beyond Ukraine’s borders; Salem’s wife and daughter are part of that exodus. Downtown the city bristles with fortifications, the famous beaches have been mined and troops and volunteers are trying to keep up morale and spirits for an attack they believe has been delayed, but not deterred. A land advance was halted by Ukrainian defenders at the town of Mykolaiv, about 120km to the east. But Ukrainian officials and foreign intelligence have repeatedly warned that Russia is still planning an attack, massing warships off the coast, and may try to bypass Mykolaiv. Britain’s defence ministry said Russia had already carried out one amphibious landing in the eastern Sea of Azov “and could look to conduct further such operations in the coming weeks”. It has also blockaded the country’s Black Sea coast, in effect isolating Ukraine from trade by sea. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, claimed Russian plans for a seaborne assault on Odesa last week were abandoned only because of the weather, and were back on the table, although he promised a fierce defence. “The Ukrainian forces are waiting for them there, the situation is under control.” There is someone to meet them, just as they were “met” outside Kyiv and other cities where Russia troops have suffered heavy casualties, he added. The city’s defenders say Odesa is ready, after nearly three weeks of preparation, their plans bolstered by copying tactics that have worked against Russian forces elsewhere. “We have turned the city into fortress Odesa,” said Artyem, a battalion commander of the national guard in Odesa who declined to give his last name, citing security. “We call Odesa the mother city because it will accept any child, from any continent. But it is also a protective mother, and Odesa will kick the ass of anyone who tries to offend her spirit. We say anyone who hurts mama will sink into the sea.” They are watching Russian troops to see if they try to bypass Mykolaiv – his hometown – to move on Odesa by land, or attempt an assault from the sea, although military experts say Russian supply lines would be highly vulnerable to attack without a land route to the city. “They have three ways to bypass Mykolaiv, and so our target goal is to close all entry and exit points. Particularly in Odesa, there are lots of places where they could launch an assault,” Artyem added. The city was apparently safe enough this week, and officials had enough free time to organise a tour for Bernard Henri Levy, the French public intellectual spotted in the city. They were trying not to get complacent, and keep the mood in the city calm, in the face of daily reports on atrocities in Ukrainian cities that are under attack, from besieged Mariupol to the capital, Kyiv, where suburbs have become killing grounds. “We have a couple of tasks. One is to decrease the level of panic inside Odesa, protect the perimeter of the city, and identify saboteurs. We have watching eyes on the air, the sea and the ground,” Artyem said. Their biggest need, said Sergey Bratchuk, a spokesperson for the military administration in the city, is a no-fly zone over the city, a request made regularly to the west by Ukrainian officials but so far firmly rejected on the grounds it could lead to escalation of the conflict. “The most important thing is to close the sky,” said “It would be easier to defend Odesa and all Ukraine without Russian planes.” Salem is confident enough of the preparations that he has volunteered to go and serve on the frontlines in Kharkiv, or nearby Mykolaiv. “I don’t think in the next couple of days they are going to come here,” he said. “They are torturing us with the wait, their strategy is to try and make us lazy or sloppy.”",News/World news,‘Fortress Odesa’: city falls silent as fearful residents await Russian advance,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/fortress-odesa-city-falls-silent-as-fearful-residents-await-russian-advance-ukraine
3/15/2022,"The Republican senator Josh Hawley must stop using an infamous picture of him raising his fist to protesters at the US Capitol on January 6 on campaign merchandise, the news site Politico said. The shot was taken on 6 January 2021 as Hawley, from Missouri, made his way into the Capitol for the certification of electoral college results in Joe Biden’s victory over Donald Trump. Supporters Trump told to “fight like hell” in defense of his lie about electoral fraud attacked the Capitol. The attempt to stop certification failed but Hawley was one of 147 Republicans to lodge objections regardless. A bipartisan Senate report connected seven deaths to the riot. Trump was impeached. In February, Hawley’s campaign started selling $20 mugs featuring the picture, with the caption “Show-Me Strong”, a play on Missouri’s “Show-Me State” nickname. The picture was taken by E&E News, which Politico bought in December. On Monday, Politico said it had sent a cease and desist letter and said: “We do not authorize [the picture’s] use by the Hawley campaign for the purpose of political fundraising, which the campaign has been put on notice of by legal counsel. “We are eagerly awaiting a response, but in the interim again respectfully ask that the campaign immediately cease and desist unauthorized use of the image.” A spokesperson for Hawley said: “We haven’t received any correspondence from Politico or anyone else, but we are in full compliance with the law. Perhaps Politico can show us the correspondence they sent to the many liberal groups who also used the photo.” Politico has allowed the Associated Press to use the photograph for editorial purposes. On Tuesday morning, the mug featured on the front of Hawley’s website. As reported by E&E News, a fundraising email in February said: “Liberals are so easily triggered, and this new mug is really whipping the left into a frenzy!” It also said the mug was “the perfect way to enjoy coffee, tea, or liberal tears! Check it out below, and order one for yourself or any woke friend or family member that you want to trigger!” Hawley told the Huffington Post: “It is not a pro-riot mug. This was not me encouraging rioters.” He also said he was not condoning violence when he raised his fist. “At the time that we were out there,” he said, “folks were gathered peacefully to protest, and they have a right to do that. They do not have a right to assault cops.” Hawley was widely criticised for the gesture, and in the aftermath of the riot saw Simon & Schuster cancel plans to publish his book. In the book, The Tyranny of Big Tech, Hawley said he had been “branded a ‘seditionist’ and worse. But like many others attacked by the corporations and the left, my real crime was to have challenged the reign of the woke capitalists”. Responding to a Guardian report, he wrote: “Oh dear. I’ve offended the delicate sensibilities of the Guardian! I didn’t get their approval before I wrote my book. Order a copy today and own the libs.” The book was released by a rightwing imprint distributed by Simon & Schuster. As the Guardian reported, according to public financial disclosure records, Hawley turned out to have “invested potentially tens of thousands of dollars in the very companies he denounces”.",News/US news,Mug shot: Republican Josh Hawley told to stop using January 6 fist salute photo,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/15/josh-hawley-january-6-fist-photo
3/15/2022,"Not so long ago, I had the misfortune of discovering some wildly out-of-date cream cheese festering at the back of my fridge. I would rather burn down my fridge than ever put myself in that position again. Luckily, I don’t need to. Cream cheese is one of those magic ingredients that can lift almost any dish, so it’s easy to use up. Some recipes here call for a full tub, others just a spoonful. The first and most obvious thing to do with cream cheese is to make a cheesecake, but you already knew this. I’m going to suggest Tamal Ray’s honey and ginger cheesecake with streusel topping; a Basque-inspired wonder that is almost as much creme brulee as cheesecake. It uses a ton of cream cheese, so it probably isn’t strictly a leftovers recipe, but it is spectacular nonetheless. Using half the amount of cream cheese (but still quite a lot), is Michael Zee’s recipe for stuffed french toast, which is decadent to the point of absurdity. Imagine a sandwich, filled with a mixture of cream cheese, strawberries, rosewater and jam, that is soaked in milk then fried in butter. This is the sort of breakfast you would make no more than once a decade, because the human body can only withstand so much opulence. Reducing the amount yet again, Lauren Miyashiro’s recipe for strawberry shortcake cookies calls for just a few tablespoons of cream cheese. The scantness is because these are filled cookies: the cookie dough is carefully folded around a dollop of sweetened, lemony cream cheese. It is much more of a faff than making regular cookies, but the result is magnificently fluffy. Plus, you will get to use up your old cream cheese, which is the reason we’re here, remember? Moving on to savoury dishes, Nigel Slater’s 2020 recipe for salmon and cream cheese tart is a thing of wonder, like a quiche from the gods. Spiked with dill, it’s the sort of tart that has an irresistible wobble when it comes out of the oven, and is bound to impress anyone who tries it. I only looked at the official Philadelphia recipe website in the hope that it would throw up a godawful, who-would-eat-this concoction. Sadly, though, it only contains rigorously solid recipes. The best of them is its creamy lentil curry. This is perfect leftovers territory, requiring just three tablespoons of cream cheese, and it will be on the table in 20 minutes. It has the potential to become a weeknight staple. Clearly, the best thing about cream cheese is its ability to turn into culinary catnip when heated enough. Yotam Ottolenghi’s prawn and cream cheese pasties make full use of this quality. Mixed with prawns, chilli and tomato, the cream cheese in these tiny, deep-fried pasties has a habit of exploding as you bite into them. Heavenly. If you only want to use minimal ingredients and less effort, you can achieve roughly the same effect as Ottolenghi’s pasties with Alvin Zhou’s jalapeño poppers. Get a chilli pepper, fill it with cream cheese, wrap it in bacon, and bake. You will soon be in a red-hot, molten wonderland. Obatzda is a German dish made with soft cheese, cream cheese and wheat beer. Just a Little Bite’s recipe is perhaps a little thicker than most, but it’s still basically just an assembly job rather than a full kitchen expedition. Plus, its consistency allows it to be used as a sandwich spread just as easily as a pretzel dip. Before we wrap up, here is an exercise in contrasts. If you’ve just got a bit of cream cheese to use up, and you’re at a loss for lunch ideas, chuck a spoonful into some scrambled eggs. It works absolute wonders, making the eggs fluffier and creamier, while the temperature will help to prevent them from overcooking, so you won’t have to labour through a miserable rubbery meal. Greatist has a handy walkthrough, but it’s all pretty much self-explanatory. Finally, the most elaborate, labour-intensive cream cheese recipe on Earth. That’s right, it’s Molly Baz’s cheese-filled croquembouche. Forty-eight savoury profiteroles, delicately filled with a mixture of herby cream cheese, ricotta and parsley, glued into a vertigo-inducing tower with pepper-flavoured caramel. You will probably never, ever make this, but it is unarguably a thing of wonder.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Spread the joy!

3/15/2022,"When I did a string of drivetime interviews for BBC local radio during the first week of Vladimir Putin’s hideous war against Ukraine, a question several presenters asked me was simply: “What does Ukraine look like?” In the allotted five minutes I tried to give an idea: it’s not flat and covered in dark pine forests like much of Russia; it’s green and gently rolling, and dotted with medieval fortresses, romantically neglected baroque palaces and monasteries, and quiet, pretty towns and little cities, much like those of Austria or the Czech Republic. Kyiv itself is a grand Belle Époque metropolis with up-and-down cobbled streets and chestnut trees. There are funny little back alleys and courtyards full of coffee shops and art galleries, leafy parks with views over the sprawling river Dnipro, and an array of glorious churches, the grandest of them the 11th-century Saint Sophia Cathedral. In the midst of the unfolding human tragedy is the appalling cultural loss the war may wreak. A rich mixture of influences – Polish, Russian, Viennese, Soviet, Jewish and even Ottoman, as well as its own folk traditions – informs the country’s art, architecture, music and literature, producing a gorgeous potpourri that is, paradoxically, distinctly Ukrainian. And as with any underdog country, culture is particularly important for Ukrainians, having carried the national identity through long centuries of foreign rule. The big city currently most at risk is Kharkiv, still in Ukrainian hands but under heavy shelling. Long a commercial centre, it has handsome 19th-century merchants’ houses and warehousing (home, until now, of a thriving contemporary art scene), but is most remarkable for its constructivist government buildings, built during the 1920s when Kharkiv was the capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. As the architectural historian Owen Hatherley says, “Only Dessau in the old East Germany, or maybe Tel Aviv, compares to it for buildings of that era.” So far the most prominent of them – a futurist vision of blocky concrete and flying walkways – is undamaged. But another – one of several reclad in Stalinist neo-classical style – lost every window and part of its roof when a missile landed nearby on 1 March. The city’s landmark “Slovo” (“Word”) building has already been directly hit three times. Shaped like a C – the first letter of the word “slovo” in Cyrillic – it was built to house prominent writers, scholars and artists; for Ukrainians, it represents the period’s brief cultural flowering before Moscow cracked down again and sent most of its residents to the gulag. Kharkiv’s Fine Arts Museum has been damaged, too. Photos posted on social media by staff show blinds hanging in tatters, and parquet floors scattered with broken glass. Some pictures have been laid face-down on the floor; others still hang on the walls. Among other treasures, it houses 11 canvases by the great 19th-century painter Ilya Repin, who was born nearby but built his career in St Petersburg, Paris and Moscow. “The irony of the situation,” the head of the museum’s foreign art department told Reuters, “is that we are having to save Russian artists’ works from their own people.” One of the most historic cities under siege is Chernihiv, a couple of hours’ drive north of Kyiv on the main road to the border with Belarus. On a quick visit four weeks ago, it was as quiet and beautiful as ever, its clutch of churches white, green and gold against a blue sky and the sparkling snow. A local guide, now fled with her daughter and granddaughter to Lublin in Poland, tells me on the phone that so far as she knows the churches are still – “glory to God” – undamaged, but that the Soviet-era cinema on the main square has been destroyed, “and our lovely fountain too”. She breaks down in tears talking about the kindness of the Poles. Also at risk are Ukraine’s archives. Since Putin began closing the Russian ones to all but approved researchers, Ukraine’s records have become a way into the Soviet period for historians not only of Ukraine, but the whole Soviet Union. Their closure is a blow to scholars round the world. Daria Mattingly, a leading historian of Stalin’s 1932-3 artificial famine, fears “archivocide”. Russian occupiers “might destroy everything that doesn’t fit into their narrative … That would be catastrophic; it would be the erasing of Ukrainian identity.” In Kyiv and elsewhere, archive staff are working round the clock to scan documents and to move digitised material on to servers abroad. For some it is already too late. The building that houses the Chernihiv province’s KGB records lost its roof to shelling a few days ago; it’s not yet clear how much was lost. The Budapest-based art historian Konstantin Akinsha is terrified for the fate of Odesa, where the Russian troopships lurking just offshore are expected to attempt a landing any day. The words tumble over themselves as he lists its collections. One of the best is at the Odesa art museum. Volunteers have been helping staff pack up paintings and take them to safety. They are fearful of looting or Russian confiscation, and so are understandably tight-lipped about where they are now. But since they have thousands of items to deal with, and many are evacuating (the museum’s director took the hard decision to leave with her baby son), much remains in situ. Akinsha also worries about Odesa’s Museum of Western and Eastern Art, which has Frans Hals’s St Matthew and his St Luke (their fellow evangelists hang in Moscow’s Pushkin Museum and Los Angeles’s Getty). And then there’s the Archaeological Museum and the Literature Museum. “It has unbelievable manuscripts,” he says. “I want to cry. It’s absolutely scary.” Another concern is vandalism and looting by occupying troops; on 14 March, Russian soldiers broke into offices in a neo-baronial castle near the city of Zaporizhzhya, and deliberately smashed up office furniture and equipment. What Akinsha would like to see – apart from more and bigger anti-aircraft guns from the west – is strong anti-war public statements from prominent museum-world figures in Russia. “I’m not asking them to go to Red Square and set themselves on fire. But they could come out with something at least. They are completely silent. It’s disgusting.” As we wait to see what Putin has in mind for ravishing Kyiv – a siege, artillery barrages, air-dropped chlorine bombs like in Syria? – the UK government announces that it is sending more and more sophisticated anti-aircraft guns to Ukraine. They will not be able to protect cities from short-range shelling, but should be able to prevent bombing from the air and by long-range ballistic missiles. It’s late; we should have started arming the country months ago, when Putin started building up his forces on the border. But it’s much better than never, and will help to save not only lives.
