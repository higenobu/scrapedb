12/26/2021,"Rafael Benítez has held talks with several of Everton’s brightest academy prospects to convince them to commit their long-term futures to the Goodison Park club. Everton lost the promising left-back Thierry Small to Southampton in the summer after the 17-year-old, who became the youngest first-team player in the club’s history in January, rejected their offer of a professional contract. The club are in a similar predicament with the highly rated forward Lewis Dobbin, who is out of contract next July and free to sign a pre-contract agreement with a continental European club from 1 January.  Benítez, however, has made a personal intervention to reassure Everton’s young talents that a pathway to the first team remains open after Marcel Brands’ departure as director of football. The academy fell under Brands’ remit and, while the club conduct a review of their internal structure, the Everton manager has sought to persuade academy players to extend their Goodison careers. The Everton manager said: “When the situation of the club changed a little bit in terms of the structure, the first thing that we did was to have two or three meetings with young players, their agents and their families to try and make sure they could stay with us for a long time. I did it personally with some of them.” The defender Jarrad Branthwaite and the forward Ellis Simms have signed new contracts at Everton recently, until 2025 and 2024 respectively, but negotiations on a new deal for Dobbin have reached an impasse. The 18-year-old has represented England at under-16, 17 and 19 level and has attracted interest from other Premier League clubs, whom he could join for a development fee next summer, and clubs in Germany. But Benítez is hopeful of reaching an agreement. “I don’t like to talk too much about that but I think the player is quite happy and our conversations with him have been quite positive,” the Everton manager said. “I have confidence that he will be delighted to stay with us in the future.” Benítez has given Dobbin three substitute appearances in the Premier League this season, including in the recent draw at Chelsea, when five Everton players are believed to have contracted Covid-19, and he would have been involved in the Boxing Day game at Burnley had the match not been postponed. The Premier League initially rejected Everton’s request for a postponement due to their Covid cases and six injuries but “regrettably approved” the request on Friday.",Sport/Football,Rafael Benítez urges Everton’s brightest young talents to commit futures to club,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/25/rafael-benitez-everton-brightest-young-talents-future
12/26/2021,"Labour has demanded the outlawing of trail hunting on public land, as Boxing Day meets prepare to go ahead. Several licences have been granted by the government for the meetings, despite a growing movement among public bodies to refuse permission for them to take place on their property.  In trail hunting, which remains legal, dogs and riders pursue an artificial scent on an agreed route. However, the National Trust suspended licences to trail hunt on its land after a video emerged of a huntsman explaining how to use them as a way of holding an illegal foxhunt. Since then, both Natural Resources Wales and the National Trust have announced an end to trail hunting. Campaigners opposing the events said that they still expected more than 240 hunting days to have taken place on Ministry of Defence-owned land alone this year. Labour said the department had allowed 21 licensed hunts by mid-December. Other public bodies continue to have a suspension of licences in place, including some national parks, the Church Commissioners and Forestry England. An exemption to lockdown rules allowed trail hunts to take place last Christmas. Labour now wants a tightening of the rules this year. It follows the case of Mark Hankinson, the director of the Masters of the Foxhounds Association, who was convicted in October of encouraging others to hide the illegal hunting of live foxes behind a “smokescreen” of trail hunting. Hankinson was convicted of encouraging or assisting others to commit an offence over comments in two web seminars. “We need to have clear, visible, plausible trail laying being done throughout the day,” he was recorded saying. He added: “It’s a lot easier to create a smokescreen if you’ve got more than one trail layer operating, and that is what it’s all about – trying to portray to the people watching that you’re going about your legitimate business.” Jim McMahon, the shadow environment secretary, said allowing trail hunts to go ahead on public land was “completely irresponsible”. He added: “The government must do more to close the loopholes that allow people to break the law, and must consign hunting to the history books, where the vast majority of us believe it belongs.” With Boxing Day falling on a Sunday, some hunts have been moved to Monday. Polly Portwin, director of the campaign for hunting at the Countryside Alliance, said last month that the hunting world was “looking forward to showcasing their lawful trail-hunting activities again this year and welcomes the return to village greens and town centres across the country”.",News/UK news,"Outlaw trail hunting on public land, demands Labour",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/25/outlaw-trail-hunting-on-public-land-demands-labour
12/26/2021,"There is, the statswallahs tell us, no such thing as new-manager bounce. Our brains, attuned to spotting patterns, spy a regression to the mean and attribute it to the arrival of a new manager. And probably in the long term that is largely true. But it does seem to ignore the way the replacement of one manager by another can lead players to reset and refocus; a project that had gone stale can, at least temporarily, be refreshed. It also ignores Antonio Conte. Five Premier League games since he took over at Tottenham have yielded 11 points and, while beating Leeds (narrowly), Brentford and Norwich may not seem like much, the performance in last week’s 2-2 draw against Liverpool represented a clear upturn. There was an energy and intensity that has not been seen since the Mauricio Pochettino era – and not even really in the final few months of that.  At which point, before anybody gets too excited, it probably is worth remembering where Spurs were at Christmas last year. Then, too, Tottenham had just reached the League Cup semi-finals and although they were sixth in the league, a place better off than this season, they were only six points behind the leaders, Liverpool, and two points off second, rather than 18 points behind the leaders, Manchester City, and 15 off second as they are now (albeit they have three games in hand on many of the sides above them). It had been only two league games earlier that a win at Anfield would have taken them top, and there had even been a thought that in a weird Covid-affected season, with empty stadiums, a truncated pre-season and a compacted calendar, José Mourinho’s vision of football might again be successful, the ancient king returning to bestride the ravaged world. As it turned out, his negativity at Anfield after Spurs’ equaliser invited pressure that brought a Liverpool winner, precipitating the doom cycle of seven wins from 19 league games. So while Tottenham’s position may look ostensibly similar to how it appeared last Christmas, the direction of travel looks very different. Taking over mid-season should make it difficult for a coach who specialises in pressing. Really, he needs a full pre-season to get the players fit enough and to instil those patterns. At Tottenham, there had been a sense, under Mourinho and then Nuno Espírito Santo, that fitness levels had dropped from where they were under Pochettino: his pressing demanded it; their more reactive approach did not. And yet Tottenham have gone from running 100km a game under Nuno, the lowest figure in the Premier League, to 115km a game under Conte, the highest. Although being without a number of players must have complicated things, it may be that the three postponed matches have helped, giving Conte a little time to work with his squad without the immediate pressure for results. But still, the upturn is remarkable. Football is an increasingly complicated game, but maybe all they needed was to get off the ketchup. The condiment prohibition is easy to mock, but it is important for what it represents: Conte cares about details, he demands self-sacrifice and he is changing the wider culture of the club. Whether that improvement is sustainable is another issue. Jürgen Klopp took over at Liverpool in October 2015 and, after an initial uplift, results were patchier towards the end of that season as injuries and fatigue took their toll. But that the possibility of tiredness is even an issue is a marked improvement; it’s only a month ago that this was a squad that looked in need of wholesale replacement. And that is down to Conte. There is a danger that focusing on his personality and energy neglects the detailed work he does in terms of structuring programmes of pressing – and this is a coach, it should not be forgotten, who when in charge of Italy refused to allow any but his most-trusted assistants to attend his sessions on pressing so that details couldn’t leak out to opponents – but equally the biggest change so far has been one of tone. When Daniel Levy appointed Mourinho, he was looking for somebody who could administer a jolt of electricity to a moribund squad. Perhaps a decade earlier he could have done. But this is weary, cynical, late-period Mourinho and he soon took to pointing out the limitations of his players to deflect blame from himself. That squad is even more beaten down now, and yet Conte has given them renewed life: Dele Alli, Harry Winks, Steven Bergwijn and Davinson Sánchez, who all looked shot, suddenly look like footballers again. Ryan Sessegnon has been rediscovered. Suddenly it’s not just about Son Heung-min and Harry Kane. (Although Kane is another issue; he may not yet be as lethal in front of goal as he is at his best, but at least he has looked re-engaged recently.) The monster, this ungainly hybrid squad cobbled together from previous visions of the club, has awoken again. Conte, notoriously, always wants more players and always ends up falling out with his board because of it. He will, surely, be demanding investment in personnel and probably wouldn’t have taken the job without certain assurances, no matter what the club may have said in public. But he is good with imperfect materials: when he took over Juventus in 2011, they were not the super-club they became but in transition after Internazionale’s treble. When he led Chelsea to the title in 2016-17, they were recovering from what he dubbed the “Mourinho season”. He made Inter title winners despite the seeming dominance of Juve (aided, it’s true, by Juve’s oddly self-destructive leadership) against the backdrop of financial meltdown. Among the elite-level coaches, Conte is probably the best manager of less-than-elite-level players. Which should give Tottenham hope. This is a squad that requires work, but Conte’s arrival, his intensity and his energy have been enough to arrest a year of decline, which itself followed 18 months or so of drift. Perhaps it’s true that the average manager makes only a limited difference, but Conte is not an average manager.",Sport/Football,Antonio Conte has given Tottenham players the jolt they badly needed | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/dec/25/antonio-conte-has-given-tottenham-players-the-jolt-they-badly-needed
12/26/2021,"Mikel Arteta hopes Arsenal will be active during the January transfer window as they size up their prospects of a return to Champions League football. Arsenal are fourth in the Premier League going into a highly winnable Boxing Day clash at Norwich and it is a position few had expected them to occupy earlier in the season, particularly when they lost their opening three games. Below them West Ham, Manchester United, Tottenham and Leicester have games in hand but, even if those were all won, Arteta’s team would be firmly in the hunt. It is notoriously difficult to make satisfactory deals in January but Arteta would be open to any that could see his team over the line.  “If you can tweak what you need to in that period, which is not easy, it would be really helpful,” he said. “We are working on that to see the necessities we can have, and whether we can find the right solutions to that.” A striker would appeal to Arsenal, with Eddie Nketiah and Alexandre Lacazette coming out of contract and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang frozen out, although that situation is likelier to be addressed in the summer. There would be a vacancy for cover on the right wing, though, if Nicolas Pépé is allowed to move, and Arsenal are arguably a body short in central midfield. Whoever comes in, Arteta will be at pains not to disrupt a core of young players whose stature is growing rapidly. Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe, two academy products, are arguably their most important outfielders and Arteta knows the value of the bonds players forge during their development. At Barcelona’s La Masia academy, which differed from Arsenal’s because players boarded together, he came through with a number of those who became members of Pep Guardiola’s all-conquering side, and the impression was long-lasting. “I was living at La Masia – it was a bedroom of eight,” he said. “I had Pepe Reina, Víctor Valdés, Andrés Iniesta, Carles Puyol … What I learned was that internally there was competition: we were all at the same age and wanted to be first-team players but could not all get there. But what I learned as well was within that competition you understand that you have to look after each other. That was a big, big lesson in that period for me. “Some of them are still my best friends because it is tough and you go through important, key moments in your career and it stays for life. Those relationships are unbreakable.” Saka has experienced a particularly demanding year for club and country, on the pitch and away from it. “What I see is a young boy with incredible enthusiasm and passion for this club,” Arteta said. “I see it in others too. They are really willing to bring success and they are dealing with a lot of difficult situations in a great way. “That shows the education they had, the background, environment and families they have, and how supportive the club have been throughout their careers. But it is not normal at that age to do what they’ve been doing. We have to be prepared [so] that, if they can’t cope with something, we are there to identify that and act straight away.” Arteta has not ruled out a return for Aubameyang to the side that faces bottom-placed Norwich, although it would be a considerable surprise unless Covid-19 has stretched his resources further. Aubameyang posted a festive family picture on social media with the message: “Merry Christmas #Familyfirst”. Pablo Marí, Albert Sambi Lokonga and Calum Chambers have missed recent games with the virus but his regular starting XI is yet to be affected during this wave. Arsenal are among the clubs battling to hold on to their Africa Cup of Nations representatives until 3 January, which would mean Aubameyang, Pépé, Thomas Partey and Mohamed Elneny would be eligible to face Wolves on 28 December and Manchester City on New Year’s Day. The World Leagues Forum has written to Fifa and the Confederation of African Football saying the deadline for players’ release should be pushed back from 27 December.",Sport/Football,Mikel Arteta optimistic Arsenal will boost top-four hopes in transfer window,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/25/mikel-arteta-optimistic-arsenal-will-boost-top-four-hopes-in-transfer-window
12/26/2021,"Pep Guardiola believes masks should be mandatory in every public space to help ensure games will not have to be played in closed stadiums again due to the surge in Covid cases. Manchester City’s manager is concerned that because masks have to be used only in designated indoor environments this may not be enough to prevent football having to lock out fans once more. The champions are due to host Leicester City on Boxing Day, but Liverpool v Leeds and Wolves v Watford have been postponed because of the virus.  Facing the prospect of football being played behind closed doors Guardiola said: “I would not love it, honestly. You cannot imagine how different it is playing with people. But cases rise all around the world, not only in the UK, and in the football bubbles. These people go to the stadiums and can contaminate [others because] in the stadiums, people don’t use masks. “It’s what I’m surprised about the most – you go to the street, big malls, places to buy presents for the family, no one wears a mask. The scientists from the beginning say the most protection you can have is via hand sanitisers and [face masks]. “In Spain now it will be an obligation not just in [some] places but outdoors. So on the street you have to wear it. We should start again – you know [fans at matches should be] vaccinated, have a booster if this is what is decided, but as part of that, hand sanitiser, social distance and masks too. Like this, the restaurants could still be open, football could go on. We have to try to do it, otherwise, you know, another [ban] may be coming. [And] it [may] be again and again.” Guardiola says that Ederson, along with City’s other South American players, Fernandinho and Gabriel Jesus, suffer when returning to the club after the international break. “There was a period this season when Eddy came back from previous internationals with Brazil and was a bit low, a bit sad, and sometimes that happens in a season,” he said. “But over the last two or three weeks in his training sessions I feel this is the best Eddy we have had. “Sometimes you have no specific reason for it, but it’s especially the case for players from Argentina, Brazil, all the South Americans. They go there and, because of the pandemic, play three games, whereas before it was two. They travel from here to Ecuador, Bolivia, Uruguay, to other places, take the plane, come back here, have jet lag, come back to totally different conditions. “They are human beings. They have this change of lifestyle in such a short time. So it happened with Eddy, but it has with Fernandinho when he was in the national team before, with Gabby [Jesus], with Sergio [Agüero] when he was here, Pablo Zabaleta, Nicolás Otamendi.”",Sport/Football,"Mandate wearing of masks to keep stadiums open, urges Pep Guardiola",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/25/mandate-wearing-of-masks-to-keep-stadiums-open-urges-pep-guardiola
