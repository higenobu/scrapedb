1/17/2022,"Following the dismissal of Rafa Benítez from Everton in the wake of their defeat at the hands of Norwich City on Saturday, his compatriot Roberto Martínez is being tipped for a return to Goodison Park, despite being unceremoniously shown the door by Everton majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri in 2016.  Currently in charge of Belgium and with a World Cup looming on the horizon, it remains unclear why Martinez would be willing to swap the job of managing genuine contenders for sifting through the pile of smouldering rubble Rafa has left behind him at Goodison Park but the Mirror reports that Everton have already opened talks with the Belgiam FA in a bid to buy their target out of his contract. Derby County boss and one-time Everton hero Wayne Rooney is also being considered for the vacancy, while Moshiri is also known to be a huge admirer of José Mourinho, whose days at Roma look numbered. While Everton fans are likely to be underwhelmed by the prospect of either Martínez or Mourinho rocking up at Goodison Park, the arrival of Rooney, who is doing a terrific job at Derby County under extremely difficult circumstances, might meet with their approval. In the interim, a Big Dunc and Leighton Baines dream team seems likely to take the reins until a permanent appointment is made. Another week, another raft of speculation linking Newcastle with players of sufficient quality to make a decent fist of keeping the world’s most monied club in the Premier League. They want Donny van de Beek but Manchester United’s lesser spotted midfielder is reported to be unenthused by the prospect of signing for a club in their lowly position. Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Keylor Navas is the latest big name star to inch his way across the Mags’ radar but his particular Middle Eastern employers have no desire to let him go. Progress has been reported in Eddie Howe’s bid to lure Sevilla central defender Diego Carlos to St James’ Park, but Newcastle have had a £33m bid for Monaco’s 20-year-old defender Benoît Badiashile rejected by the Ligue 1 club. In need of a left-back now that Ben Chilwell has been ruled out for the rest of the season, Chelsea are reported to be “in talks” to sign PSG’s Layvin Kurzawa on loan and have also been linked with Ivan Perisic, the Croatia veteran who has been playing left wing-back for Internazionale this season and only has six months left on his contract. Manchester United are open to offers of around £15m for Phil Jones, who could find a new home at Burnley or – you’ve guessed it – Newcastle. The injury-prone defender was the best of a bad United bunch on his only appearance of the season against Wolves earlier this month but has long been surplus to requirements at Old Trafford. Having lost Chris Wood to Newcastle last week, Burnley could offer Andy Carroll an unlikely Premier League return after the striker’s short-term deal with Reading ended at the weekend. And finally, Arsenal’s attempts to bring Juventus midfielder Arthur Melo to the Emirates remain a work in progress but have something of a snag. Juve have decided they want Thomas Partey in exchange. That cackling sound you can hear is Mikel Arteta laughing at their impertinence.",Sport/Football,"Football rumours: Martínez, Rooney or Mourinho to manage Everton?

1/17/2022,"The chairman of Credit Suisse, António Horta-Osório, has resigned after the Swiss bank reportedly found that he had broken Covid-19 quarantine laws, including by attending the Wimbledon tennis tournament. Horta-Osório, the former chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, said in a statement that his “personal actions” had made it more difficult for him to represent the bank. He had also admitted breaking Swiss quarantine rules.  It means that Horta-Osório managed less than a year in the job, after he was brought in to steady the bank after a series of expensive failures, including its involvement in the collapse of Archegos, an investment company, and Greensill Capital, a supply chain finance firm. “I regret that a number of my personal actions have led to difficulties for the bank and compromised my ability to represent the bank internally and externally,” Horta-Osório said in a statement issued by Credit Suisse on Monday. “I therefore believe that my resignation is in the interest of the bank and its stakeholders at this crucial time.” The breach emerged in December, after Reuters reported it was discovered through a preliminary investigation by Credit Suisse’s legal team. The news came just weeks after Horta-Osório admitted that he breached Covid rules in Switzerland, having flown out of the country within three days of arriving on 28 November despite being required to quarantine for 10 days. Credit Suisse confirmed on Monday that Horta-Osório had resigned after an investigation commissioned by the board, but did not give any details of the findings. The bank has appointed Axel Lehmann, formerly a senior executive at its Swiss rival UBS and the Swiss insurer Zurich, to take over as chair of its board. Horta-Osório attended the Wimbledon tennis tournament on 10 and 11 July 2021, having flown from flown to the UK from Switzerland. At that time Switzerland was on the UK government’s amber list of countries that required arrivals to isolate for 10 days. Breaching quarantine rules was a criminal offence, according to UK government guidance, which stated that police could issue offenders with fines starting at £1,000 and rising to £10,000 for repeat offences. The Portuguese executive had been brought in by Lloyds in 2010 as chief executive after the bank’s government bailout during the financial crisis. The government sold its last remaining shares in May 2017 under his watch, but Horta-Osório had already drawn criticism for large bonus payments. Lloyds announced his departure in 2020, and Credit Suisse reported his appointment six months later. Horta-Osório was brought in to steady the ship after the bank admitted hiring private detectives to spy on executives. The Archegos and Greensill collapses cost the bank billions just as he was due to start in the role.",News/Business,Credit Suisse boss António Horta-Osório resigns over Covid breaches,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/17/credit-suisse-antonio-horta-osorio-covid-wimbledon
1/17/2022,"Sick of sweatpants? A new fashion trend that swaps elasticated waistbands for harder, more utilitarian clothing could be right up your street. Taking inspiration from dark cinematic fantasies such as The Matrix Resurrections and Dune, “dystopia-core” comes as we approach the third year of pandemic living.  Dystopia-core, which is in direct opposition to “dopamine dressing” – wearing overtly fun clothes to help lift your mood – can be seen as the next step of the grunge and goth revivals. “Fashion statements often have an element of defiance. In this particular case the defiance is the darkness and dystopian aspect,” says the trend forecaster Geraldine Wharry. “The idea that optimism is not cool and doesn’t reflect our current times, similar to what punks stood for during the 70s.” The items that have come to define the trend – long leather jackets and cargo trousers – have both had bumps in popularity. Online searches for the former have risen by 117% between the third and fourth quarter of last year while searches for cargo pants have increased, year on year, by 45%, according to Jewellerybox.co.uk. Dystopia-core can also be seen on TikTok, where the DIY trend of draping thinly textured clothes over one another to create an angular, futuristic look has been gaining popularity. Nicknamed “avant apocalypse”, the hashtag has more than 265,000 views on the social media app. “People have stopped the rather passive onesie/pyjama stay-at-home, work-from-home-in-your-comfort-clothes trend and realise that they need to be more active and get out – and to do that, you need to be wearing something more functional, more resilient – and more classy,” says Nick Groom, the author of The Vampire: A New History. It is, says the fashion professor Zara Anishanslin, a reaction to the current post-apocalyptic atmosphere. “The experience of living through a pandemic is somewhat like that of living through a war: both are traumatising collective experiences, both have people battling on the ‘frontlines’, both result in a distressingly large number of deaths,” she says. “Given these similarities it makes sense that fashion originally popularised by military use would see a resurgence.” Francesca Granata from Parsons School of Design sees these clothes as a kind of armour against the hostile outside world. “In the last two years we have been constantly thinking about protecting ourselves from outside pathogens so it is not hard to see how clothes can function, at least symbolically, as an extension of this shield that we have been creating around us,” she says. “One response to [the pandemic] is to try to develop a durable, self-contained, sustainable image,” says Groom, “not blur it with fringes and scarfs and tassels, but by making the human form sleek and sharply defined.” The largely black and ominous clothes worn by the new couple Kanye West and Julia Fox – all made by Balenciaga – speak to this look. As well as Balenciaga, fashion labels such as Khaite and A-Cold-Wall* are articulating these emotional states. “The idea of protection is a bit more universal across luxury, contemporary and streetwear now, for sure,” says A-Cold-Wall*’s Samuel Ross, who tackles dystopia-core in his autumn/winter 2022 collection in Milan this week. “We’ve played with that a bit more in terms of length I’d say and overall volume,” he says. “We’ve always had a utilitarian angle but this season we wanted to bring in a more ‘on the nose aspect’ so we used mottled, hand-painted and fired canvases and twills to convey a sensitivity [to that].”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Dystopia-core: what is the new pandemic-era punk look?,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/17/dystopia-core-what-is-new-pandemic-era-punk-look-fashion
1/17/2022,"Since winning the TS Eliot award for poetry last week, Joelle Taylor has been referred to on more than one occasion as a “slam poet”. Which, she says, is fascinating: “Because there’s no such thing as a slam poet.” A poetry slam is an event, a spoken-word competition, she adds, not a type of poetry. Taylor, who was named UK performance poetry slam champion in 2000 and founded the national youth slam championships SLAMbassadors, is forgiving, though: “It’s just a way of people trying to understand a different kind of poetry.” But it’s clear that this need to distinguish spoken word from other forms of poetry has a whiff of snobbery about it.  “You can’t talk about published poetry without talking about class, or gender, or race, or sexuality,” she says. “Because these are all the doors that are shut – we’re still in a publishing situation where the majority of those published are white men.” Of course, the fact that Taylor’s C+nto and Othered Poems, which started as a spoken-word poem about butch lesbian counterculture, has won one of the UK’s most prestigious poetry prizes is a sign that some of those doors are opening. When we meet for coffee three days after the ceremony, Taylor tells me that her inbox is still being flooded by members of both the LGBTQ+ and spoken-word communities who feel like they’re finally being seen. “The judges choosing someone like me says something really profound about the way that literature and poetry are changing,” she says (though, despite the overwhelming support, she insists that she is not going to cry). Tears or not, this is clearly an emotional moment for the 54-year-old poet, who has spent decades on the fringes. Growing up in a working-class family in Lancashire where “you wouldn’t even say the word lesbian,” Taylor faced abuse from her classmates at school. Out of “sheer bloody-mindedness” she became the first member of her family to get O-levels, and eventually moved to London, hitchhiking her way there. “The phrase ‘coming out’ seems so celebratory now,” she says. “But when we came out, more often than not, it was a direction: we must get out.” In London, Taylor became part of the city’s underground butch scene, recently documented in the film Rebel Dykes – in fact, Taylor knows most of the women in it. Those years of partying and protesting are the inspiration for C+nto and it’s a time that Taylor is clearly nostalgic for, despite the fact that she would regularly get shoved or slapped on the street. “While it was a very oppressive time, it galvanised us and brought us all together,” she explains. She describes the 1988 protest against Section 28 as one of the best days of her life: “It was the first time I’d ever held a woman’s hand on the street.” Part of the reason Taylor wanted to honour that community through C+nto is because she feels like something has been lost. The collection mentions dozens of lesbian bars – the fictional Maryville that the characters in the poems frequent, but also real ones like the Bell and the Y Bar. Today, there is just one lesbian bar left in London, She Soho. “One of the reasons there’s been all this shrieking on social media is because we’ve lost these places,” says Taylor. “It’s very hard to disagree with someone sitting in front of you in a bar who’s very nice.” Ah yes, the social-media shrieking. It was inevitable, of course, that Taylor’s collection would spark conversation around gender identity, given its emphasis on the female body and how it is politicised. Before she went on tour to perform C+nto, she was “terrified” about the reaction she might get from her own community. But she has been pleasantly surprised by its positive reception. She’s spoken to trans-rights activists, trans men and gender-critical feminists who have all seen themselves in the poems. “Isn’t that wonderful?” she says. In fact, Taylor sees her book as a “bridge” that can hopefully bring a fractured community back together. “I don’t want to add any more drama – it’s dry as fuck. People have just got to get a grip.” Instead of fighting each other online, the LGBTQ+ community “needs to focus,” she says. “Five hours away from London they are pulling lesbians on to motorways and beating their skulls open. It’s happening in Chechnya, in Hungary, in Russia. It’s happening in Uganda and Ghana. Three-quarters of Poland now is an LGBT-free zone. “All these little things are very important on an individual level” – a reference to the internet infighting – “but they are literally murdering us. So could we just get together?” Togetherness is what Taylor returns to again and again – it’s the only way, in her mind, to combat the rise of LGBTQ+ hate crimes in both this country and others. Is there a chance that could happen? Are things like Rebel Dykes and C+nto signs of a changing attitude? “Yes,” says Taylor, immediately. “We’re alive. There’s hope.”",Arts/Books,‘They are literally murdering us’: poet Joelle Taylor on bringing the LGBTQ+ community together,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/17/poet-joelle-taylor-ts-eliot-prize-lgbtq-community
1/17/2022,"Expectations were high when Chelsea’s executives shook hands on the £58m deal that brought the much sought-after signature of Christian Pulisic, the man who the club’s director, Marina Granovskaia, hoped would “become an important player for many years to come”. Three years and 95 Chelsea appearances later, the American is yet to match that description and has too rarely given the impression that he might ever do so. At Manchester City he was a non-presence, seeing little of the ball and doing nothing with it when he did. City are about as tough as opponents come but big money demands to be repaid on big occasions. Pulisic has the talent and temperament to deliver in such fixtures – his elegant goal against Liverpool this month was proof of that – but too often he seems content to exist on the periphery of matches rather than bend them to his will. At 23, time is on his side – though the Chelsea hierarchy are not exactly known for their patience. Alex Hess  Match report: Manchester City 1-0 Chelsea The dispute between Ralf Rangnick and Anthony Martial is the latestunwanted vignette in a Manchester United season heading for the annus horribilis file. After Saturday’s 2-2 draw at Aston Villa the interim manager claimed the forward refused to be part of the squad for the trip. Martial’s response was to vehemently deny this on Instagram. If United’s position on Sunday – offering no clarification – was a clear backing of Rangnick’s words, the real issue here is how the contretemps shines more light on an institution seemingly on a one-way ticket to the wilderness unless someone sorts it, soon. As a mid-season Mr Fixit this is not Rangnick’s concern. It is Richard Arnold, Ed Woodward’s replacement as United’s highest-ranked executive from 1 February, who must have a forensic and wide-ranging plan. For a blueprint, the 50-year-old should study Manchester City, who under Khaldoon al-Mubarak’s intelligent chairmanship, are the industry leaders. United are coming up to a decade since their last title, and the question is starting to become: when will the next one ever arrive? Jamie Jackson News report: Martial denies refusing to be included in squad If there’s one thing guaranteed to fill fans of a relegation-threatened club with dread, it’s a frenzied splurge of unheard-of January signings. From the outside looking in, then, Watford’s activity over the last fortnight – which has seen the recruitment of Maduka Okoye from Sparta Rotterdam, Hassane Kamara from Nice, Samir from Udinese and Edo Kayembe from KAS Eupen in Belgium – seemed to have all the hallmarks of a doomed trolley-dash. Yet any such notions were quickly shown up as parochial nonsense during a battling draw featuring three standout debutants. The dynamic Kamara slotted in smartly at left-back, while at centre-half the Brazilian Samir showed his nationality was no barrier to him enjoying a good old-fashioned tussle with Chris Wood, who he kept quiet. But the visitors’ best performer was Edo Kayembe, who patrolled the area in front of the back four with poise and authority, and showed a nice eye for a defence-splitting pass. João Pedro’s equaliser kept Newcastle in the bottom three, and Watford out of it. Will the same be said for Watford’s January arrivals come the season’s end? Alex Hess There were a few memorable details from Norwich’s victory over Everton at Carrow Road, including the pitch invader who furiously flicked the ‘Vs’ at Rafael Benítez, and the 20-year-old Adam Idah beginning to confirm some of his promise with a first Premier League goal for the Canaries. But the match was also a curiosity in that it saw two teams pair up against each other in 4-4-2 formations. Once a shape so quintessentially English it was assumed players could not adapt to any other, 4-4-2 is now largely adjudged to be antiquated. Watching Salomón Rondón alongside Dominic Calvert-Lewin for the Toffees, that verdict seemed fair; two big men standing around waiting for crosses like a pair of forlorn hitchhikers. For Norwich, however, it was more fluid and seemed a considered solution from Dean Smith to both a lack of cutting edge and the need to protect his full-backs. By the time the match reached 55 minutes with the Canaries 2-0 up, Benítez abandoned his experiment, going 4-2-3-1 in a desperate search for salvation. Despite Richarlison’s excellent overhead kick, however, it never arrived. Paul MacInnes Match report: Norwich 2-1 Everton Newcastle have played 10 games under Eddie Howe, winning one, drawing four and losing five. The latest, a damaging home draw with Watford, emphasised the manager’s need for not only at least one new centre-half but a defensive midfielder able to shape and control matches. With the £25m striker Chris Wood virtually anonymous on his debut, Newcastle needed a wonderful solo goal from Allan Saint-Maximin to go 1-0 up but their longstanding inability to retain a lead soon resurfaced, permitting João Pedro to register an 88th-minute equaliser. It was a gut-punch for the St James’s Park crowd, though Howe may draw some consolation from the returning Paul Dummett’s intelligent marking of Emmanuel Dennis. Louise Taylor  Match report: Newcastle 1-1 Watford Conor Gallagher may have laughed off the comparisons to Frank Lampard but the loanee’s performances for Crystal Palace this season have been reminiscent of his parent club’s record goalscorer. Gallagher’s excellent strike against Brighton to cap off a brilliant team move means that he now has seven goals and three assists since moving to Selhurst Park on loan, but he insists his focus remains on this season. “Let’s be serious, I can’t be compared to someone like that,” he said. “Chelsea is one of the best teams in the world right now, it is a tough team to get into. I’m not really thinking about that at the moment, I’ll try and do my best for Crystal Palace. The way football is goals and assists gets you praise like I have been getting. I need to continue to perform, not just goals and assists. But I am happy with the way it is going so far.” Ed Aarons Match report: Brighton 1-1 Crystal Palace The glamorous debutant who struck a late equaliser understandably took all the headlines at Villa Park, but there’s a fair argument that Philippe Coutinho was only his side’s third most impressive midfielder on Saturday. Emi Buendía, whose place looks most obviously threatened by the Brazilian’s arrival, put in a probingly creative display and showed enough flashes of link-up play with Coutinho to suggest that the two playmakers needn’t be competing for one position. But Villa’s star performer was Jacob Ramsey, who scored one and set up the other in a riveting all-action central midfield performance that would have had the manager furrowing his brow in approval. Ramsey has already started more games since Steven Gerrard took charge in November than he did over the whole of last season, and the early signs are that the new boss’s judgment is spot on. After losing the beloved Jack Grealish last summer, have Villa found a new local hero? If so, then he’s already got the perfect mentor. Alex Hess Match report: Aston Villa 2-2 Manchester United The ball zoomed into the top corner like a tungsten dart but, as Ralph Hasenhüttl said, James Ward-Prowse’s preposterous free-kick from 30 yards out deserved to finish as more than a footnote to a frustrating defeat at Wolves. Last week the Brentford head coach, Thomas Frank, suggested Ward-Prowse could be the best free-kick taker on the planet and only David Beckham can better Ward-Prowse’s tally of 12 free-kick goals in the Premier League. His latest strike was surely his best yet, not that he basked in it for too long: the second the ball cannoned into the net, Ward-Prowse headed back towards the Southampton half, ready for the restart with six minutes left to play. “If there’s a stipulation that I have to beat his record in order to meet him [Beckham] then I’ll be looking to do that as soon as I can,” Ward-Prowse said last year. “He’s an absolute legend, a great of the game, a huge role model and inspiration for me even now, and I’m 27.” Ben Fisher  Match report: Wolves 3-1 Southampton The London Stadium offered the latest proof that in Raphinha, Leeds have one of the best in the Premier League. Jack Harrison scored a hat-trick but it was the Brazilian’s passing and verve that cut West Ham’s defence to ribbons. Leeds had a fourth goal ruled out when an offside Rodrigo failed to get out of the way of Mateusz Klich’s shot, the ball having been laid on a plate by Raphinha after he had left Issa Diop with twisted blood. “We still have half a season left,” shrugged Marcelo Bielsa when asked where Raphinha’s future lies. A bidding war in the summer is certain for a player whose class is matched with a work ethic equal to any of Bielsa’s squad. Leeds, riven by injuries, were reduced to bringing on two Premier League debutants, Lewis Bate lasting just 43 minutes, but their star man inspired them to thrilling victory. John Brewin Match report: West Ham 2-3 Leeds January has been long marked out as a danger-month for Liverpool because of the loss of two of the team’s much-lauded front three to the Africa Cup of Nations. To an extent, rightly so: Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané have averaged 52 goals between them in their four full seasons together. But it is also true that this campaign has probably been Mané’s patchiest in a red shirt, and a return of one goal in his last 10 outings means that his absence may not warrant the gloomy prognosis many have offered. It may even be a good thing: Sunday’s win featured goals from two of his ostensible competitors for a place in the team, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Takumi Minamino, while Mané himself has already found the net on international duty. Win-win? Perhaps – although a quick glance at Jürgen Klopp’s substitutes on Sunday (average squad number: 37) suggests that Liverpool might not want their big guns missing for too long.

1/17/2022,"Novak Djokovic fought the Australian government in the same way he fought his rivals on the tennis court: with defiance and stone-willed refusal, with every tool at his disposal and every last fibre of his being, with an unshakeable and messianic belief in his own supremacy. He contested his deportation as if it were a crucial break point, as if it were his last stand against total oblivion. This time, however, something startling happened. He lost.  Djokovic is unused to losing. When he does, he tends to explain it away as the product of his own failings. He courteously congratulates his opponents, but ultimately leaves you with the impression that he decides who wins and loses. His collection of trophies and records – 20 grand slam titles, the most weeks at world No 1 in the history of men’s tennis – suggests he is probably right. But implicit in that too is an assertion of control and individual impregnability: this is my business, and I will deal with it myself. The problems arise when you begin to conflate the hard white lines of the tennis court with the messy compromises of the world at large. Djokovic would hardly be the first professional athlete to labour under the delusion that his superior sporting ability confers some kind of elite virtue, a firewall against judgment and scrutiny. Nor would he be the first to confuse his athletic gifts with expertise in other fields: lifestyle, health and medicine, even politics. “I can show you how to change not just your body but your whole experience of living,” he promises in his 2013 book Serve to Win: part-autobiography, part-nutrition guide and a presage of the Instagram influencer culture that bundles up diet, mental health, body-narcissism and alternative medicine into a shiny, sellable package. No athlete is obliged to stay in their lane. But anybody who leverages their fame, power and privilege in this way has a responsibility to do so with care, to reckon with the consequences of their choices, to recognise when they have become counter-productive. And perhaps the most disquieting aspect of the last fortnight, as the Djokovic circus rolled out of Melbourne Airport and on to our smartphones and television screens, is the way Djokovic’s choices have unleashed forces and currents far larger than him, or indeed tennis: a toxic chain reaction of mistrust and resentment that could lead us into some extremely dark places. You could see it in the seething throngs who gathered outside Djokovic’s hotel to rail against Australia’s vaccine laws. You could see it in the Serbian politicians attempting to redefine this visa paperwork dispute as a parable of liberty versus tyranny. “A symbol of the free world, a beacon of free men,” declared the former prime minister Nebojsa Covic. You could see it, too, in the bowels of the internet, where one conspiracy movement has anointed Djokovic as its “unvaxxed sperm hero”. Which, if nothing else, is one way of settling the GOAT debate. Doubtless Djokovic would repudiate many of the causes now attempting to trade on his name. And of course this stuff has always been there in various forms. But thanks to Djokovic and his belligerence, it now has a bigger platform, attention and momentum, lenses and microphones. There is a time to fan the flames and a time to rein things in, and when Nigel Farage is travelling to Serbia to meet your parents and pose for photos in your trophy room, that time has probably passed. There is a natural temptation to see Djokovic himself as something of a hapless innocent in all this, a credulous idiot with his healing water and kooky science playing with toys he knows nothing about. And yes, there is an opportunism on both sides here. Djokovic’s treatment by the Australian government and its ribbiting cane toad of a prime minister has been a nauseating sight. The Australian Open as a tournament has been weakened and overshadowed. But let’s not pretend we’re dealing with two opposing arguments of equal merit here. Djokovic is not simply some new-age ingenue who ticked the wrong box on a form. We should recall that last month, he tested positive for Covid and then marched straight out of the house to do a photoshoot. This is a man who has done more than any leading player to attack the principle of equal pay in tennis, with his insistence that “women should fight for what they think they deserve and we should fight for what we think we deserve”. Djokovic himself has explained how his political outlook intersects with his beliefs on health and medicine. “Growing up under communism, you are not taught to be open-minded,” he writes in Serve to Win. “People at the top are invested in making sure we do not question what we are told to believe. Whether it is a communist ruler or the rulers of the food and pharmaceutical industries, people at the top understand that most of us are led by fear.” At the heart of the Djokovic worldview, then, is an unswerving belief in the power of self-realisation, of the freedom of an individual to alter their own world, irrespective of the consequences of others. It is the same libertarian streak that runs through the anti-vax movement, the American right and a significant part of English national identity, which is why it is hardly surprising we elect leaders who believe the rules are for little people. This, perhaps, is why Djokovic’s case has incited such strong feelings. It is in many ways a microcosm of the debates tearing societies apart all over the world. What are our responsibilities to each other? How open should our borders be? Where does the right to personal freedom end and the duty to others begin? Who even gets to make these decisions? As Djokovic’s plane took off on Sunday night, it was tempting to see this as an end. In fact, the broader struggle is only just beginning.",Sport/Sport,Djokovic circus unleashes toxic chain reaction of mistrust and resentment | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/17/djokovic-circus-unleashes-toxic-chain-reaction-of-mistrust-and-resentment
1/17/2022,"Last year the Environment Agency received more than 100,000 reports of water, air and land pollution in England. The public told of rivers flowing with human faeces, chemicals dumped, fish killed, factories emitting dangerous fumes, nature reserves and the countryside trashed, as well as unbearable noise and dirty air. Nearly all these reports were ignored and now we know why. According to shocking leaked documents, the agency, which is the statutory protector of England’s natural environment and therefore of much of its health and safety, had ordered its staff to ignore all but the most obvious, high-profile incidents. Its staff were sent to observe only 8,000 of the 116,000 potential pollution incidents and only a handful of companies were taken to court.  In effect, there is now no one in authority even questioning the pollution that blights much of Britain, causes disease, destroys the natural world and costs billions of pounds every year to clean up. That toxic waste dumped at the bottom of your street? Forget it. Your local nature reserve or park despoiled? Don’t worry. That factory illegally belching formaldehyde? Look the other way. Fighting pollution is no government’s strong point, but protection against the destruction of nature has been bitterly fought for. Now it is being wilfully trashed. At least in the 1980s, when environment secretary Nicholas Ridley was dubbed the “minister against the environment” and Britain was the “dirty man of Europe”, the EA was more or less independent of government, science-based, and quick to jump on polluters and to prosecute. Anyone fouling a river was likely to be investigated and at least admonished. The problem then was that the fines imposed by the courts were so minimal that the law was flouted at will. To understand what is happening now, go back to 2011, shortly after David Cameron was elected. In his autumn statement the chancellor, George Osborne, said that he wanted to remove the “ridiculous” social and environmental costs of business. A list emerged of 174 regulations he wanted scrapped, watered down, merged, liberalised or simplified, and the prevailing governing coalition – shame on you, Nick Clegg – knowingly set about trying to abolish controls on asbestos, invasive species and industrial air pollution, as well as protections for wildlife and restrictions on noise pollution. It was war on the environment and public safety. The forests were to be sold off, badgers exterminated and the land fracked. The climate crisis was not to be addressed at the expense of business, and profit was not to be subservient to nature. Even as the crisis was building, and nature everywhere was known to be in steep decline, government was ideologically obsessed with deregulation and actively making a grim situation even worse. Thanks to fierce opposition, not least from some of his own backbenchers and EA staff, not all of Osborne’s anti-red tape measures could be shovelled through. But faced with opposition, the government simply strangled, muzzled or frightened the major regulatory bodies that together have been charged with protecting people. The leaked document shows the extent of the damage done. Over the past 10 years, the EA has had its budget slashed, its staff massively reduced and its powers weakened. Polluting businesses are now expected to self-regulate and report their own transgressions, prosecutions are rare, and the agency admits that it has neither the staff nor the money to do anything other than scratch the surface of control. In words destined to become as notorious as when disgraced environment minister Owen Paterson said “the badgers have moved the goalposts”, the agency now warns, “you get the environment you pay for”. Last week, too, the environmental audit committee reported that a “chemical cocktail” of raw sewage and slurry was polluting many of England’s rivers. According to watchdog group Unchecked UK, between 2011 and 2016, the agency’s protection budget fell by 62% and staff numbers were cut by nearly a quarter. Prosecutions fell by 80%, the number of pollution incidents logged dropped 29% and water samples taken by the EA fell by 28%. Meanwhile, nearly half of England’s sites of special scientific interest – the jewels in the crown of nature – haven’t been checked for many years. Nor is it only the EA, or England. Taking cues from Donald Trump in the US, all other protection agencies have been neutered, including Natural England, the Forestry Commission, Natural Resources Wales and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. Funding for the Food Standards Agency was slashed by half between 2009 and 2019, , and that of the Health and Safety Executive, which oversees workplace safety, by 53%. Proactive inspections by local authorities have been almost abandoned and prosecutions have plummeted. The obsession with cutting “red tape” has been ruinous. Deregulation of the construction industry contributed to Grenfell and the cladding scandal, and allowing water companies to use rivers as sewage dumps – even as they were allowed to cut investment and reward shareholders – will cost tens of billions. Public outrage and the courts may have forced small improvements in air pollution, but tens of thousands of people still die needlessly every year because ministers refuse to bring standards up to the minimum World Health Organization levels. It is now just a matter of time before another major chemical incident like that at Camelford, in Cornwall, in 1988 – when water was contaminated and up to 20,000 people poisoned – takes place. Proposed new rules buried on a government website suggest that the new post-Brexit British chemicals regulator will have only limited powers and that Britain may become a dumping ground and a laboratory for toxic chemicals. The proposals will not be subject to public consultation and will not require a vote in parliament. Supposedly overseeing the almighty regulatory failure of the past decade will be the new Office for Environmental Protection. This new public body is to report to parliament and be theoretically independent from government. But the secretary of state will appoint the chair and other board members, there is no guarantee it will be adequately funded, and it will not take on all functions of the EU institutions that previously protected the public. Britain is already one of the least safe places to live in Europe. From now on, the government can introduce damaging policies with little fear of official comeback and companies are more or less free to abuse the environment. With cash-strapped, politically cowed regulators muzzled, few inspections likely and little danger of prosecution, we can look forward to a pandemic of pollution.

1/17/2022,"In the infant artform of online theatre, Thaddeus Phillips is already shaping up to be its most imaginative exponent. In 2020’s Zoo Motel, the Colombia-based writer and performer turned inwards to transform a tiny motel room into a palace of possibility. Now, in Zoo Mundo, he faces outwards. From the same small studio in his family home, he tells an epic tale of three globe-straddling journeys that follow the route of mankind’s 3.4 million-year trek from Ethiopia across the continents. There’s an explorer doing the whole thing on foot, an artist touring his exhibition about human bones and a man discovering the fate of his mother who never returned from a trip home to the USSR.  Phillips does this by means that are both ingenious and endearingly handmade. With the Zoom audience looking on – and occasionally joining in – he takes us rapidly from the swanky Caffè Florian in Venice’s St Mark’s Square and onwards, via overnight train, to an electrical factory in Siberia, the jungles of South America and, eventually, the Coffee House at McMurdo Station in Antarctica, the last cafe on Earth. Working with designer Steven Dufala and co-director Tatiana Mallarino, he inserts himself into his cardboard cut-out landscapes, sometimes an eye peering in, sometimes his whole body in view, playfully warping our sense of scale and perspective. With a blend of magician’s tricks and object-theatre techniques, he builds the story before us in a way that feels theatrical, despite its dependence on the camera. Although the journey is more important than the destination, he neatly brings its three strands together to conclude a delightful show about our big place on the planet and small place in the universe.

1/17/2022,"On 2 January 1972, the Sunday Times ran a short preview for a new documentary. “If you are in the least interested in art,” it began, “have your set tuned and be ready to have your eyes opened by John Berger in the first of a stunning new series.” Ways of Seeing was broadcast on BBC Two at the unpromising hour of 10.05pm on a Saturday night, the same time as Match of the Day. It had a modest audience and few reviews, and yet the anonymous critic was right. This idiosyncratic documentary, made on a shoestring budget, has been snapping eyes open for half a century. Ways of Seeing has inspired generations of writers, artists and curators, spawning academic conferences and tribute programmes. According to the novelist Ali Smith, who watched it as a child, “even its title set me on a road where I knew there wasn’t just seeing, there were … ways of it”. It reached a new tranche of readers last year by way of the American model Emily Ratajkowski, who opened her memoir My Body with Berger’s quote: “You painted a naked woman because you enjoyed looking at her, you put a mirror in her hand and you called the painting Vanity, thus morally condemning the woman whose nakedness you had depicted for your own pleasure.”  From the very first scene, in which Berger takes a knife to a Botticelli, it was clear that Ways of Seeing was an assault on thoughtless reverence. He used the European tradition of oil painting as a way of investigating political ideology, unearthing damning evidence of an entrenched and exploitative system in the lovely works of Caravaggio and Leonardo da Vinci. One of the reasons the series is so lastingly influential is that Berger empowers the viewer, transforming them from passive consumer of high culture to detective, stalking venerated artefacts in search of the master key to patriarchal capitalism. These paintings, he told his audience, might look beautiful or eternal, but they were actually produced for the wealthy and well born, to celebrate and solemnise their status. A landscape was not innocent, and nor was a lobster, let alone a nude of Venus. All were commodities. It was their ownership that was being exalted, and not their intrinsic existence. As for the dry-as-dust interpretations in museums, these were designed to mystify the ordinary viewer, lest they grasp the sleight of hand that had been performed. Berger wanted to break those chains, and to do so he performed an enchantment of his own. By 1972, Berger was a well-known, often controversial art critic, novelist and broadcaster, then in his mid-40s. For minutes at a time, he stands alone against a blue screen, talking urgently and persuasively into the camera. With his curly hair and chainmail shirt, he looks like a cross between Patrick Swayze and Jim Henson’s StoryTeller, the charisma of his preaching style sitting a little uneasily with the trenchant message of demystification. The counterpoint is a parade of images constructed by the director Mike Dibb, which build a perhaps more subtle argument. The camera ticks between famous paintings (filmed after hours in the National Gallery) and images of real life, discovering often startling parallels. In the episode on the nude, it jumps from pinups and street footage of actual women to classical beauties by Titian, Ingres and Cranach, demonstrating how women are trained to become the passive object of the male gaze. It was this argument that Ratajkowski found so compelling, although not everyone at the time appreciated the politicised argument. Clive James wrote to the Listener, complaining about “Mr Berger’s attempt to redeem the western artistic tradition for Women’s Liberation”. Berger himself later explained that he was drawing on the pre-existing work of feminists, although he could certainly have made this clearer. In the second half of the nudes episode a group of five women politely discuss their reactions to his film. None are formally introduced, although their names are given in the credits. Most were deeply involved in the nascent second-wave feminist movement. One was Eva Figes, whose 1970 book Patriarchal Attitudes is an undoubted precedent, while the articulate woman in glasses is Jane Kenrick, one of five who had just been on trial for protesting against the 1970 Miss World contest. An academic and activist for workers’ rights, she died in 1988 at the age of 42. Her work should not be forgotten. Other inspirations are more carefully attributed. The first episode is a reworking of Walter Benjamin’s The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, which had only recently been translated into English. What Ways of Seeing really did was act as a vessel for carrying these electrifying new ideas into the mainstream. It is inevitably described as influential, but perhaps it’s more accurate to say that it arrived right on time, conveying a new attitude or approach to culture that would soon be dispersed globally, in post-colonial, queer and feminist studies, in Marxist readings of Jane Eyre, in media studies classes, and art school reading lists. The same cannot be said for how it was made. Ways of Seeing represents a zenith of creative freedom at the BBC, only glimpsed now in the work of Adam Curtis, which likewise combines a seemingly radical message with an oddly didactic narrator. Berger might have been the face of the series, as well as the better-known partner, but the process of making the series was unusually collaborative. It was one of Dibb’s early outings as a director, and interference from above was nonexistent. Berger had already abandoned England for a farm in the Alps, and draft scripts were posted back and forth for months. The subject for the final episode was not decided until well into the shoot, when Berger became fascinated with adverts during a journey by tube. This risky, on-the-hoof way of working, with its sense of experiment and fresh discovery, is what gives each episode its fizzing energy. The BBC’s electronic music pioneer Delia Derbyshire provided the ambiguous, open-ended soundtrack, enchanting Dibb with her habit of taking snuff as they worked. But how did Ways of Seeing actually get seen? Broadcast in the pre-VCR, pre-digital age, the programme itself was swiftly inaccessible. It was repeated once in 1973, after winning a Bafta, but was not screened again until 30 July 1994. Unless you had resorted to that new technology the video recorder, as some prescient teachers did, it was the companion book that gave Ways of Seeing its longevity. Lifetime sales in the UK alone currently stand at 1.5m, making it one of the most widely read books on art ever published. The first edition cost 60p. “We wanted it to be the cheapest art book ever made,” Dibb says. “We tried to do everything an art book didn’t do.” Although it’s often treated as a purely Berger production, it was also a collaboration, this time with a team of five. The graphic designer Richard Hollis was responsible for the book’s distinctive appearance, including putting the first six and a half sentences on the cover, alongside a painting by Magritte. The text itself, printed in eye-bending bold type, was a smoothed and tightened version of the film’s script. Both versions represent the echt Berger style: at once poetic and didactic, fluid and rigid. Sternly, he points out the wicked ideologies locked into paint, the grotesque display of capitalism, profit, property in Gainsborough’s Mr and Mrs Andrews and Holbein’s The Ambassadors. Swooningly, he shows how the light falls in a Vermeer. Sometimes it is as if two people are talking, and in fact Berger was at a crossroads in his own work. As Ways of Seeing carried theory into the world, he moved away from it, consecrating himself to an artist’s take on politics and not a political take on art. Part of what makes watching it so compelling now is Berger’s fascinated immersion in the culture of images itself. Take a single shot from episode two. Against a closeup of dresses in shining pink and sea-foam green, we hear his dreaming voice say: “The faces of the women in so many European paintings are like the faces of swimmers in seas of silk and satin.” No other critic had that kind of loving, estranging vision, the capacity to see the grid of forces in which we are entrapped while still conveying the ravishing, time-stopping power of paint. If its style of analysis has become commonplace, Ways of Seeing retains a capacity to stun new viewers with its revelations, although these days the wealthy are more likely to invest their money in NFTs than Rembrandts. The most relevant episode for our own digital era is the last, on the imagery of advertising. Berger reveals a dreamworld that we all move through continuously, a visual bombardment designed to conjure deep feelings of inadequacy and desire, the long seduction by capitalism upon its hapless subjects. This spell has only grown more powerful in the intervening decades. These days we inhabit a universe of disembodied images, constructed by mysterious forces we can’t quite glimpse or understand. Berger identified that process of mystification and knew it as the pickpocket’s device. To break it begins with understanding what you see, and realising that seeing is an active choice. Art is not separate. It is part of how reality is built – or for that matter made anew.

1/17/2022,"Shannan Gilbert’s grave in Amityville cemetery lies eight miles from where she went missing in May 2011 after visiting a client at Oak Beach, a spit of sand dotted with holiday homes on New York’s Long Island, three miles short of Gilgo Beach, where her remains were found eight months later. Gilbert’s final resting place, with a simple headstone at the back of the cemetery inscribed with her dates – 24 October 1986 – 13 December 2011 – speaks to an enduring mystery of how she, along with 10 or more other women, mostly sex workers who advertised on Craigslist, ended up dead along the same stretch of scrubby barrier marshes more than a decade ago.  13 December is not the date Gilbert went missing. A year and seven months earlier – 1 May 2010 – she’d made a frantic 22-minute call to 911 from the area and reportedly said: “They are trying to kill me.” She knocked on two neighbor’s doors, before disappearing back into the night. Three other 911 calls were made that night. One call was from Gilbert’s client Joseph Brewer and two were from the neighbors. During the search for Gilbert, police found four more sets of remains later identified as Melissa Barthelemy, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Megan Waterman, and Amber Lynn Costello. The Gilgo Four, as they became known, had been discarded in a similar fashion, 500ft apart, each swathed or covered in burlap sack cloth. Six more bodies were found in the same area at about the same time. Their dates of death, too, speak to the uncertainty that pervades the case of the Long Island serial killer. Police initially said they believed Gilbert drowned by accident, which few believed, and a medical examiner’s autopsy proved inconclusive. In the 11 years since, Gilgo Beach has become synonymous with violent death and law enforcement failures rooted in incompetence or, worse, institutional disregard. But now, it seems, concrete steps are finally being taken to try to solve the mystery once more. Last week Rodney Harrison, the new police commissioner of Suffolk county, inherited the case – which has become one of the most notorious unsolved crimes in the US. It goes back to 1996, when body parts of the earliest-known victims were found on the shores of Fire Island, a holiday destination. It was Harrison who said he would release Gilbert’s 911 call “as long as it doesn’t impede the investigation”. Last week, Harrison went further, saying a ring of people could be possibly connected to the murders. “I’m feeling confident that we’re getting closer to making an arrest,” he told a local news outlet. If that’s correct, it will have taken Harrison about two weeks to move a case forwards that hadn’t advanced much in 11 years. And that raises several questions, not least why would it require a police commissioner from New York City to get things going. Among the theories that have circulated was that police did not call in the FBI because they had elements of their own to hide. But Harrison said that linking the Gilgo murder investigation to local police misconduct was a disservice to the investigation. “I can reassure everybody that there’s no coverup in this case,” he said. According to the Suffolk district attorney, Ray Tierney, who worked with Harrison in Brooklyn, the case is now a firm priority. Tierney has called in FBI investigators as well as running a team of detectives of his own. “I go into it with no expectations, but there is a voluminous amount of evidence that’s been collected. We’re going to review and go where it leads us,” Tierney told the Guardian. “It matters to the victims’ families and the people of Suffolk county. They want to see it solved.” But Gilgo Beach residents last week professed a striking level of indifference. “Bad things happen all over, but some make the headlines. Other than gosh, who’d have thought that would happen here, all the talk seems to be coming from people who don’t come from here,” noted one man parked in a pick-up. The sense that the case has gone cold, and of official indifference over the last 11 years, vexes John Ray, the Gilbert family’s lawyer. Ray has been a consistent advocate for the family’s efforts to find justice for Gilbert, along with the other women who were found along the coastline. “Police incompetence, along with certain willful conduct by members of the police department, was a bad mix that destroyed the ability to solve this case,” Ray told the Guardian. Ray has pursued, through civil litigation and by applying pressure to investigators, a local resident of Oak Beach whom he believes is a prime suspect in Gilbert’s murder and those of the other women found along the beach. The man, a former senior official in the local emergency medical services, made several calls to Gilbert’s mother in the days following Gilbert’s disappearance as well as calls to regional police, her boyfriend, her driver and the client “to learn what he could about Shannan”, Ray has alleged in a civil suit. Police said initially said Gilbert had probably died accidentally in the marsh behind the man’s house, but that was before they had a body. Later they said she was calm on the 911 call. While Ray is bound by the court to not discuss what he heard on the call, he allows that what police reported “appears to be a deliberate misrepresentation of what happened”.“It starts to give you pause about what the police’s view of all this was,” he added. The man later denied his involvement in Gilbert’s disappearance and denied he’d made the calls. “So he did all of these things to try to get serious information. He had no reason to do that if he wasn’t involved,” Ray said. But other suspects are also in the frame, according to Ray. In essence, murder on this scale takes place in a context of local corruption, Ray said, and that context is what police have been unwilling or unable to expose. “All of that adds to the problem of defining the circle of guilt. The corruption involved sex and drugs, and these people are involved in either or both of those behaviors. That’s what unites them, but it’s also what makes it so difficult to pin the culprit down because there are so many people with different liabilities.” Phil Boyle, state senator for Long Island’s fourth district, has asked the New York state attorney general, Letitia James, for an outside investigation of the investigation, believing that figures in the local police force hampered the inquiry and prevented investigators, including the FBI, from looking at cellphone records. “Nobody in their right mind would remove the FBI from a serial killer investigation.” Where this may lead it is too soon to know. Melissa Cann, sister of Maureen Brainard-Barnes, told the New York Post on Monday she felt hopeful. Lorraine Ela, mother of Megan Waterman, said she had been “kind of skeptical” prior to Harrison’s press conference, but that she now felt the police chief would “work this case with dignity”. “I am tired of hearing the same crap come out of everyone’s mouth,” she told the outlet via email. “[But] I was very pleased with the words from Mr Harrison. He seems to care for the victims.” Many people involved, on a deep personal level or on a professional level that has become deeply personal, anticipate that a new police chief and district attorney from outside the region, together with FBI, can bring some hope for a resolution to a series of profoundly bleak crimes. John Ray believes that ultimately the police will identity a suspect and bring charges. But, he cautions, regardless of a conviction, “nobody will believe they are the only killer. The police bungled this case so badly and for so many years, we’ve got a Jack the Ripper situation. It will never be solved even if it is.”",News/US news,"Long Island serial killer case: after 11 years, could answers be coming?",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/17/long-island-serial-killer-gilgo-beach
1/17/2022,"If you could wave a magic wand and fix one modern ill, what would it be? Inequality? Pollution? Intergenerational unfairness? The decline of the high street? Suburban ennui? What if you didn’t have to pick, because there was one social problem that lay at the root of all of them? It’s not exactly news that Britain has a shortage of housing. We’re not building enough, and the homes we do build are often too small and in the wrong places. That means houses are expensive, with the obvious result that we have to spend more on rent and mortgages. But the real costs go far beyond that. Where we live affects our jobs, our families, even our impact on the environment. And just as smoking damages every part of your body, a housing shortage makes all those aspects of our lives worse than they should be, too.  You can see how severe the current shortage is by looking at prices. In London, the cost of a property has risen from an average of £24,000 in 1980 to nearly £500,000 this year. During the same period, average annual wages in the UK rose from £4,370 to £30,200 – so prices in the capital have risen about 1,400 percentage points above nationwide wages. Across the country the picture isn’t much better: prices have risen 900 percentage points above wages. Rents have risen almost in lock-step with wages, so a big share of renters’ collective wage rises over the years has just gone to landlords. It’s not as though bricks and mortar have suddenly become too expensive. A three-bedroom home can be built for as little as £120,000, a fraction of what it could sell for. We’re not out of space, either. Buildings only cover 1.4% of the UK, and 2% of England – less land than we gain every day when the tide goes out. No: the real scarcity is of permission to build. A hectare of farmland in Barnet, north London – yes, there is farmland in Barnet – might be worth £20,000, but planning permission is so hard to come by, it would be worth £15-18m overnight if granted, a 900-fold rise. Outside somewhere like Cambridge, the rise might be by “just” 200 times, to £4m or so. Getting permission to build within cities is difficult, too, because existing residents become Nimbys – those who cry, “Not in my back yard!” The effect of this is that housing gets built in more remote areas where opposition is weaker, instead of on well-connected sites where the need is greatest. That makes housing sprawl the norm across much of Britain, as people are forced to rely on cars, and miss out on the benefits of urban density, such as busier high streets, a wider range of public services, better public transport and greater walkability – with knock-on effects on health and wellbeing. Every region in England devotes more land space to road transport than to housing. Many devote two or three times as much. More driving means more CO2. City cores are islands of lower CO2 emissions per head, because people can walk and rely on public transport in ways not possible elsewhere. Each person in London, on average, produces roughly a ton of CO2 less every year than the rest of the country – just because they don’t drive as much. Cities have always drawn those in search of a better life, because they act as cultural and economic melting pots where people can make the most of their talents. This isn’t just a romantic idea. In the US, each doubling of a city’s size is associated with a rise in productivity per person of between 2% and 11%. In Britain, during the 19th and early 20th centuries, this meant that people of all backgrounds moved from poorer areas to then-booming cities like Manchester, Birmingham, and Glasgow. Rapid influxes of people could sometimes make for grim conditions – but these improved with the prosperity and innovation that larger populations brought. Today it is mainly only highly educated people who can find jobs that pay well enough to afford to live in city centres. Many who could have entered prosperous job markets and improved their skills never get the chance, and the rest of us miss out on the benefits of what they might have achieved. A large chunk of the additional value created by those who do move goes towards securing more expensive housing, with landowners capturing much of the productivity gain that would otherwise have fed through into higher living standards. Matthew Rognlie, an economist at Northwestern University, has shown that rising wealth inequality has been almost entirely driven by property wealth. Innovation suffers, too. The most innovative places in history, such as Renaissance Florence or the Low Countries in the 16th and 17th century, thrived because of the mixing of creative people who combined knowledge in unusual ways, such as the master craftsmen and mathematicians who made globes and other navigational equipment in 16th-century Leuven. Technological advances like those are far more common in dense, diverse cities than in sprawling ones. And ideas-focused businesses succeed when they’re located in clusters near each other. For software companies, the benefits kick in for companies located within ten-miles of each other. In businesses like advertising, it’s just half a mile — hence the importance of Madison Avenue, which gave its name to the TV programme Mad Men, to America’s advertising industry. The UK is not alone in suffering from a housing shortage. The US has the same problem in places such as New York City and the San Francisco Bay area. One study suggested that, if it tackled these shortages, the country could be 8.9% richer; in another the boost to incomes was calculated at 25%. Applied to the UK, these estimates imply that fixing our housing shortage could add somewhere between £3,000 and £8,500 to the UK’s annual output per person. That would be a huge improvement to living standards. Even the lower estimate would amount to more than the last 10 years of economic growth (pre‑Covid) put together. With such a large reward on the table, overcoming opposition to new housing should be a high priority. The solution may lie in changing the rules of the game so that Nimbys become Yimbys and say: “Yes in my back yard!” instead. One proposal would let residents vote directly to allow more housing on their street, so they could share in the increase in value that comes with the ability to build more densely. Others include letting local councils capture more of the gains that come once planning permission is granted, or allowing more dense housing to be built on the urban wasteland that often sits behind residential streets. Whatever the solution, the damage done by Britain’s housing shortage cannot be overstated. It disrupts our lives in countless ways. As long as it continues, we are poorer, less equal, more polluting and more unhappy as a result. But, in a way, that’s a reason to be optimistic. It means that the gains from fixing this one problem could be huge – bigger than anyone imagined.

1/17/2022,"At 8.06pm on Sunday, the Australian Open issued a statement. “Tennis Australia respects the decision of the federal court,” it read. “As per grand slam rules the No 1 position in the draw has been filled by a lucky loser. The updated schedule for Monday 17 January can be viewed at ausopen.com. We look forward to a competitive and exciting Australian Open 2022 and wish all players the best of luck.” It took tournament organisers 134 minutes to tweet these 58 words of nothingness – the antithesis of the past week’s drama.  Novak Djokovic’s bid to have his visa restored was officially dismissed at 5.52pm and the world No 1 would already have been at Melbourne airport before the governing body publicly acknowledged he was indeed leaving the country. The communication might as well have come by carrier pigeon. Perhaps that was the objective? Ignore it and it will go away. Pretend that the federal court had not just taken the extraordinary step of sitting on a Sunday in January – and broadcasting itself on YouTube – to solve a scarcely conceivable scandal it had helped create, then quietly sign off. Wave a perfunctory goodbye, moonwalk out of the room and stroll down to Melbourne Park as if the first grand slam of 2022 has not been completely overshadowed by an ethical, legal and diplomatic hot mess. Djokovic has left, but the hangover of his temporary presence is being keenly felt on day one of the tournament, and the wider ramifications will endure for some time yet, in an Australian election year and amid concerns from migration law experts that his expulsion sets a dangerous precedent for more deportations on political grounds. Djokovic himself has become not only the unwitting personification of anti-vaccination sentiment, but also of Australia’s appalling mistreatment of asylum seekers and its confusing and sometimes contradictory pandemic response. When it comes specifically to the standing of the country’s highest-profile international sporting event, Tennis Australia still has questions to answer beyond its brief statement. Chief among them is the role of its chief executive, Craig Tiley, who, by seeking to find a loophole to cater for an unvaccinated player chasing a record 21st grand slam title, has made Djokovic bigger than the tournament Tiley directs. Even now, the political finger-pointing from the parties involved means some of the facts associated with the case remain in dispute. What we do know is that the medical exemption which was granted to Djokovic and approved by separate Tennis Australia and Victorian government expert panels was not endorsed by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi). Tiley had been informed by the federal government in writing more than once that a recent Covid infection – conveniently contracted by Djokovic in mid-December – was not an acceptable reason not to be fully vaccinated when attempting to gain quarantine-free entry into Australia. In late November, the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, stated in a letter that “people who contracted Covid within six months and seek to enter Australia from overseas, and have not received two doses of a TGA approved or recognised vaccine … are not considered fully vaccinated”. Granted, Tennis Australia pushed for more clarity on the sometimes abstruse Atagi guidelines and also sought the help of home affairs to avoid players being turned around at the airport if they had the wrong documentation. It spent months attempting to negotiate the complexities of Australia’s federal and state bureaucracies and their differing policies. Ultimately, in the end, it took a gamble. “Primarily because there is much contradictory information the whole time, every single week we were talking to home affairs, we were talking to all parts of government to ensure that one, we were doing the right thing, and the right process with these exemptions,” Tiley told Nine three days after Djokovic was detained at the airport. “The conflicting information, and the contradictory information we received, was because of the changing environment. We are in a challenging environment.” These are the known facts, but facts do not always measure mood, and on this point, Tiley misread the room. By setting up the exemption process in the first place, Tennis Australia co-opted an issue that is bigger than sport. The move invalidated both the Victorian government’s vaccine mandate for all professional athletes and the Victorian people’s challenging experiences with the pandemic. The incensed public reaction to Djokovic’s ill-fated Instagram post demonstrates how much this was the case. These personal hardships also raised questions one year ago about the virtues of holding the 2021 tournament, which welcomed international players and their entourages despite Australia’s hard border closures. This latest blow comes with a Djokovic-flavoured kick. Blame could be directed at a number of parties with varying degrees of severity depending on which side of this polarising affair you sit. Tiley does not escape such scrutiny – and his role is now threatened. In recent months he spoke regularly with Djokovic and has been open about this dialogue. By doing so he has, at the very least, constructed the external perception – whether true or not – that the medical exemption process was effectively a “Djokovic process” that would not have been established for lower-profile players alone. For many tennis fans, this is offensive. For tennis players, it must feel worse. The result is a long-lasting blemish on the year’s opening major, eroding a glowing reputation Tiley himself has spent decades building.

Except for the fact it is likely to be coming to a pond or river near you soon – if it is not already there. The all-female freshwater crustacean has become a focus of fascination for scientists in recent years, due to its unique ability among decapods – the family that includes shrimps, crabs and lobsters – to clone itself and quickly adapt to new environments, as well as the fact that it has spread exponentially. The marbled crayfish was first recognised in 1995, when a biology student bought a bag of crayfish – sold to him as “Texas crayfish” – from American traders at a pet fair in Frankfurt. After becoming a burden to their new owner due to their inexplicably rapid rate of reproduction, he distributed them to friends who, in turn, dumped them in rivers, lakes and toilets, from where they spread rapidly, throughout Germany, much of mainland Europe and most profusely, the island of Madagascar, home to unique but extremely delicate freshwater ecosystems.  When Frank Lyko, professor of epidemiology at the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), first came across the creatures, referred to as marmorkrebs, he was astonished by their ability to reproduce clonally from a single cell, like cancer tumours, and saw them as an ideal model for research. “All marbled crayfish share the same genome,” he says on a video call from his office in Heidelberg. “But they also adapt to various different environments, and do that in a hurry, which makes them scientifically remarkable and similar to a tumour, which also adapts to its environment.” Lyko led the ambitious genome study that established the extraordinary fact that all marbled crayfish originate from a single foundational female. They reproduce without sex through parthenogenesis. In 2015, he gave the all-female crustaceans their species name of Procambarus virginalis. Invasive plant and animal species are non-native organisms that disrupt the natural balance of ecosystems, often outcompeting native wildlife, which causes their own populations to explode. A minority of non-native species become invasive but common traits include rapid growth, fast reproduction and high resilience to new environments.  For example, in South Georgia in the Atlantic ocean, the accidental introduction of rodents by whalers devastated bird populations on the islands for 250 years and required a huge mouse and rat eradication programme to protect native wildlife. Why are they a problem? Invasive species are among the largest threats to biodiversity in the world because they can permanently alter the healthy functioning of an ecosystem and cause local extinctions, resulting in large-scale economic and environmental damage. Japanese knotweed damages building foundations and flood defences in the UK, costing hundreds millions of pounds to manage every year.  Other highly problematic invasive species include the European wild boar in the southern US, the North American grey squirrel in Europe and South American water hyacinth in waterways around the world.  How do they spread? Human trade, tourism and the pet business have caused large-scale redistributions of plants and animals around the world, driving local extinctions of native organisms. A recent study in the journal Global Change Biology warned that, if left unchecked, the spread of non-native plant and animal species around the globe could lead to cataclysmic loss of biodiversity. Patrick Greenfield, biodiversity reporter In the course of his research, Lyko recalls driving to a lake about 15 minutes from his lab with his students. Donning head torches and waders and standing ankle deep in the water, “we waited until it got dark, then suddenly they emerged in their hundreds and thousands”, he says. “With a hand net, we caught them from behind and put them in buckets. It was so exciting. Soon after that, we started experimenting with eating them and found they were quite tasty.” In Germany, where the marbled crayfish have invaded lakes and rivers, authorities have adopted a strict approach to them. Klaus Hidde, a retired bank clerk turned hobby fisher, was tasked by the Berlin senate’s environment department last year with setting traps for the crayfish, which have been found in two lakes on Berlin’s western fringes. Not only are the crayfish in danger of killing off native species, “but they can also carry the so-called crayfish plague”, he says, referring to a fungal disease that more or less wiped out what had been a hugely successful European crayfish market 150 years ago. Hidde was first contracted by the department four years ago to catch armies of red swamp crayfish that had broken out of ponds in parks, including the central Tiergarten, after heavy rain, and were found scuttling through the Brandenburg Gate. “In one year alone, I caught 42,000 of them. I was seen as a bit of a saviour, even if I say it myself,” he says. He could get €13 per kg of swamp crayfish, and received a €7 top-up from the senate. Berlin restaurants snapped up the crustaceans, serving them up to diners as the novel “Berlin lobster”. Hidde is earning less for the marbled crayfish because, he believes, officials are “wary of creating demand” for the cloned animals, which could promote their breeding and exacerbate the problem. “I may give up, unless they’re prepared to make it worth my while,” he says, admitting he had personally yet to develop a taste for the meat. “I prefer to eat gambas [pawns] when I go on holiday to Spain.” Lukas Bosch, the co-founder of Holycrab!, a biodiversity startup, hopes the marbled crayfish’s nutritional value will tempt Germans looking for sustainable alternatives to intensively farmed meat. The company is turning invasive species – from raccoons, Egyptian geese and wild boar to other crayfish, such as Chinese mitten crabs – into culinary delicacies, teaming up with top Berlin chefs to appeal to the ecological sensibilities of German diners. They have already sold the meaty tails of marbled crayfish on bread rolls and are experimenting with turning the animal’s high-value protein into rich fish stews and stocks. “As these crayfish have no natural predators, our thinking is, why can’t Berliners take on that role?” he says. “Rather than giving up meat, in this case, the more of it we eat the better.” Ranja Adriantsoa, a conservation biologist, first came across the marbled crayfish in Madagascar as a freshwater ecology student, around 2010. She delicately lifts one out of a tank in her laboratory, around 12cm long from the tip of its head to its tail. As it wildly waves its antennae and clawed legs, she points at its marbled carapace and small appendages on the underside of its tail where the highly fecund animal “can store between about 200 and 700 eggs”. As it reproduces around four times a year – without needing to mate – one female has the potential to create a population of several million genetically identical females. When Adriantsoa first went to work for the department of invasive species control at the University of Antananarivo in the Madagascan capital, the emphasis was on stopping the spread of the marbled crayfish, which are highly destructive, eating fish larvae, displacing native crayfish and destroying the nation’s staple food crop, rice. “But over time that perception has changed,” Adriantsoa says. “Let’s be clear, you would not want to deliberately import these but the fact that they’re here and established, the attitude is now how to live with them.” In collaboration with conservation scientist Julia Jones, a professor at Bangor University in Wales, Adriantsoa and an international female-driven team of scientists launched the Perfect Invader to look at the impact of the marbled crayfish on human health. They found the crayfish can be an important source of cheap, high-quality protein for Madagascans, one of the poorest populations in the world where about 42% of children are affected by stunted growth. The research also looks at the potential for the marbled crayfish to help tackle the transmission of schistosomiasis, which affects an estimated 290 million people worldwide, including millions in Madagascar. The hypothesis is that the crayfish prey on the freshwater snails that host the parasitic flatworms that cause the acute and chronic disease. Back in Germany, working with the country’s largest research institute, the Helmholtz Association, Lyko is engaged in a pilot project to turn the marbled crayfish’s shells, which are high in chitin, a biopolymer, into biodegradable plastics. “You will see the first ever crayfish drinking straws this month,” he says. Jones says that the marbled crayfish have taught her and other scientists to see “the big picture”. “While we need to understand the negative ecological impact of the marbled crayfish in Madagascar, we also need to recognise and understand people having to learn to live intelligently alongside this crayfish – it’s there, there’s no getting rid of it,” she says. She was at pains to stress that all measures should be taken to stop marbled crayfish from arriving anywhere else. The animals are banned in the EU and UK, though experts say some are likely held illegally in aquariums. “They are spreading fast – they were in Poland the last time I looked, and will be in the UK eventually,” says Jones. “I think the marbled crab is likely to go down in history with other famous invasive species like the zebra mussel, the cane toad or the grey squirrel. “If you’re reading about this for the first time, you can be sure you’ll be hearing a lot more about the marbled crayfish.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,‘We started eating them’: what do you do with an invasive army of crayfish clones?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/17/we-started-eating-them-what-do-you-do-with-an-invasive-army-of-crayfish-clones-aoe
1/17/2022,"Imet this woman in Machina, in Yobe state, when I was on assignment in northern Nigeria 2020. It had taken us seven hours to get there – it’s right on the border with Niger – and it was already late afternoon, early evening. We were waiting for people to come and collect water from a solar-powered water pump when I saw her: this extremely beautiful Fulani woman. I was particularly drawn to the marks on her face. I knew Fulani women always like to look good, but it was really beautiful to see up close. There was a bit of a language barrier as I don’t speak Fula and she didn’t speak English or Hausa, but she agreed to have her photo taken.  Because it was 5.30–6pm, the light was soft and although it was a very hot region close to the desert – I remember at the end of the trip a lot of dust had got into my camera – it wasn’t too hot. I just needed to find the best spot, where the light wasn’t too harsh but was just enough to highlight her skin and bring out the features of her face. We were surrounded by people, lots of children: they were looking and smiling.

Because every time that I click, I’m recording a moment that can never come back. I’m freezing a particular time that can never recur. When I saw this woman I felt: she is too beautiful not to be photographed! But it’s not just about the aesthetics. It’s also about capturing her in that moment, and preserving it; saying that this particular tribe, or these people, used to live in Machina, and even if that might change in years to come at least I have this document, this visual proof, to show that this person was there, that these people existed. That’s the part of me that wants to document my country, to build an archive of images. It’s not always straightforward: Nigeria is a big place and I do a lot of travelling. Sometimes people cannot understand it. One of the things I get told is: “You mean to say that as a woman you just travelled to come and take pictures? How is that possible?” Sometimes people genuinely think I must have an ulterior motive. Most are very welcoming, but there will be one or two people who continue to question. But I make sure that I’m as transparent as possible. I say, look on my website. This is my homepage. This is how the images are used. I’m not a spy! Etinosa Yvonne was speaking to Lizzy Davies.
