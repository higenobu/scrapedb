1/1/2022,"US prosecutors have dropped charges against the two correctional officers on duty the night Jeffrey Epstein killed himself on their watch in August 2019 while he was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The officers, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, had allegedly falsified government records, indicating that they had made their rounds every 30 minutes to check on inmates when they had not, and instead had fallen asleep on the job, according to an indictment.  Earlier this year, the two officers entered into a deferred prosecution agreement – contingent on completing community service and good behavior. The justice department is expected to release a report on Epstein’s suicide next year. A Bureau of Prisons report obtained by news outlets in December showed that Epstein had previously attempted suicide in late July 2019, but had told an examining psychologist: “I have no interest in killing myself.” The records, first obtained by the New York Times, also revealed that an inmate at the facility had emailed prison administrators, stating: “Jeffrey Epstein definitely killed himself. Any conspiracy theories to the contrary are ridiculous.” “He wanted to kill himself and seized the opportunity when it was available,” the inmate added. Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite and long-term associate of Epstein, was found guilty this week of facilitating the abuse of underage girls at the hands of the disgraced financier. New York City’s chief medical examiner ruled Epstein’s death a suicide, but members of his family claimed his injuries indicated homicide. The Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan, the grim detention center where Epstein was held, had long suffered staff shortages. Thomas and Noel had done several shifts of over time that week when Epstein was found dead early on August 10 2019. A video obtained from the jail’s internal video surveillance system showed that no one visited the tier where Epstein was being held between 10.30pm the previous evening until 6.30am when they went in to give him breakfast and found him dead. The two officers later claimed they were being scapegoated for institutional failures. “Unfortunately, the decisions that led to the death of Mr. Epstein were not only because of what my client did or did not do,” Montell Figgins, a lawyer for Thomas, told the Times “It was because of a system that failed completely.” In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 800-273-8255.

1/1/2022,"The Guardian Footballer of the Year is an award given to a player who has done something remarkable, whether by overcoming adversity, helping others or setting a sporting example by acting with exceptional honesty. Through the window behind Simon Kjær, a grey November afternoon is dimming and the lights across the Øresund strait are starting to flicker. Boats carry commuters home between Sweden and Denmark, or in reverse; the view is striking and simultaneously mundane, a confluence of inexorable nature and everyday business. Inside, Kjær is reflecting on 12 months in which barely anything came to feel familiar. “Positive, negative, we’ve been through everything,” he says. “All the register of emotions. We had it all.” A pause; a repetition. “We had it all.”  We are here, in this meeting room at the national team’s hotel in Helsingør, because Kjær has been named the Guardian’s Footballer of the Year for 2021. On 12 June he did something nobody on a football pitch would ever expect necessary: when Christian Eriksen, a close friend, collapsed with a cardiac arrest during Denmark’s Euro 2020 tie with Finland he ran to his aid immediately, putting him in the recovery position and starting the CPR procedure that ultimately helped save his life. As the situation developed, he formed a protective ring around Eriksen with their teammates and comforted Eriksen’s partner, Sabrina Kvist Jensen. Kjær is Denmark’s captain and led them with extraordinary strength and composure through an unthinkable ordeal. The recognition has been overwhelming: name a year-end shortlist and Kjær has been on it, most notably finishing 18th in the Ballon d’Or ranking, while Uefa bestowed its president’s award on him and the Danish medical staff. He accepts our accolade with the same request that greeted the others: that it is taken as a collective honour, shared among the squad to highlight their response. “I appreciate all the positive words and gratitude,” he says. “I’m honoured. But as I’ve always said, my reaction was impulsive and so was everyone’s. What we did, we did as a team. I would not have been able to keep my shit together if I didn’t have anyone to lean against. “It was our friend: not a colleague, a friend. That made it so much more intense, and what we did was instinctive. I don’t believe you can prepare yourself for anything like it. I know, for myself, that I wouldn’t have been able to do any of this without my team by my side. At the end of the day everything was only for one purpose and that was for Christian, his wellbeing at the time and his family.” Eriksen is now healthy, which is all that has ever mattered. When the Finland game restarted with inordinate haste Kjær realised he had, as he puts it, “nothing to give” and was quickly substituted. For whatever it was worth, Denmark lost and the context makes what followed all the more jaw-dropping. Nobody would have criticised Kjær and his team for deciding a summer tournament was no longer for them; they would certainly not have blamed themselves. They took things day by day and found themselves powered by something that, even now, is not easily described. Denmark knew they were a good side but it took more than that to defy logic and reach the last four. “You tried it all,” Kjær says of their attempts to restore a semblance of normality. “We allowed ourselves to train an hour, an hour and a half a day, and then get through it with all the bounces and difficulties that the days would bring.” The first match-shaped hurdle was against Belgium on the same pitch at Parken, Denmark’s national stadium in Copenhagen, that had witnessed such trauma five days previously. They lost 2-1 but that was immaterial. Nobody who was present will forget that sun-drenched afternoon, which became a visceral affirmation of life. Amid a heady atmosphere of joy, relief, regret, gratitude and pride, Denmark tore into their opponents and could have scored five or six. Eriksen watched from the Rigshospitalet, a few hundred yards away. Forget the result: it became the match of their lives. The Footballer of the Year award is given to a player who has done something truly remarkable, whether by overcoming adversity, helping others or setting a sporting example by acting with exceptional honesty. 2016 Fabio Pisacane - The Cagliari defender showed remarkable determination to reach Serie A after being diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome at 14. “It’s an illness that strikes one person in a million,” Pisacane said. ""But it’s serious stuff once you have it."" 2017 Juan Mata - The Spaniard used sport as a tool for social change. Members from the football industry in the Common Goal movement donate 1% of income to charity projects. ""Some of the best ideas are simple ones and, when it comes to football, the power of the game is incredible,"" Mata said. 2018 Khadija ‘Bunny’ Shaw (pictured above) - The University of Tennessee striker overcame personal tragedy – she lost four brothers, three of them to gang-related violence – to guide Jamaica to the 2019 World Cup. “Remain humble, stay focused and just do the best you can,” is Shaw’s mantra. 2019 Megan Rapinoe The US World Cup winner used her stage to amplify the voices of others in the fight for equality, saying that there was no way she would visit Donald Trump at the White House because of his politics. “Everybody has a personal responsibility to do what they can to make the world a better place,” she said 2020 Marcus Rashford The forward was honoured for forcing the issue of child hunger in the UK on to the national stage; persuading ministers to extend free school meals into the summer holidays; raising money to enable FareShare, the food charity he works with, to distribute nearly 10 million meals for children and families in need. It had been a case of putting one foot in front of the other. “I went on; warm-up; dressing room; walk out for national anthem; get through the national anthem; hear the whistle; take it from there,” Kjær says, slowly enunciating each stage. “I had no idea whatsoever what would happen. Even if I went into the game knowing I should play, at the end of the day I didn’t know if I would play. I had no idea how I would act, no one did, but I was OK. So we enjoyed it and the result didn’t matter, I can tell you that, 100%. It didn’t matter. Not at any point. “The fans, the stadium, that support, the feeling inside, I think it describes what happened for Denmark overall that summer, for people who were there but also those watching on TV. How could we do that performance? I cannot find you explanations; I can only come back to the team, the support, the trust, the comfort we find in each other. Our bond was the only thing that gave us a chance to get back out on the pitch.” Their participation in the tournament hung by a thread but now they knew they could perform. Russia, Wales and Czech Republic were all seen off in a string of adrenaline-fuelled, but coolly executed, victories that led to the semi-final at Wembley. Had destiny simply decided they would go all the way? Not quite: Kjær scored an own goal and, while the extra-time penalty that brought England’s win was marginal, Denmark were out on their feet by the end. The result was fair but it cast no shadow. “If we hadn’t passed through the group stage I’d have been totally OK with it,” he says. “Sure, afterwards I might have looked back and still hoped. I’m still pissed about the penalty, and missing the final. But in the end it was secondary, and football has become secondary for me. It’s not as important as it was before.” Although he would do anything to reverse the circumstances behind this realignment, Kjær has not fought it. He calls the football pitch “the place on earth where I feel the most comfortable”; it can never quite be the same place after Eriksen’s brush with death but it has become one of perspective. It has helped him compartmentalise: every drop must be wrung from the chunk of the day allocated to football, but time with his two children every morning and evening is sacred. “When you have that experience, you carry it with you for the rest of your life,” he says. “But you learn from it, you take things out of it, and maybe that also allows me to play better football than before. I let myself enjoy it and that gives me a more relaxed approach; a more dedicated approach but one where, at the same time, I’m resting in it. I love playing football, always loved it, but I don’t have 10 more years so I have to appreciate the time that’s left.” Those words soon carry added meaning. After the interview has finished Kjær graciously offers a follow-up conversation if any loose ends need tying, but neither of us really expects it to be necessary. Three weeks later, though, his fresh outlook is tested. In the early moments of Milan’s match in Genoa on 1 December, he collides with Andrea Cambiaso and is taken off on a stretcher after lengthy treatment. It looks bad and two days later the news is confirmed: he has required surgery to the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, along with a reinsertion of his medial collateral ligament, meaning he will be out for six months. On top of the year’s other fluctuations, Kjær did not need this. He has been playing the best club football of his life, anchoring the defence for Stefano Pioli’s rejuvenated side and perhaps bearing out his own analysis. At 32 there has been no sign of a slowdown, quite the opposite, but now it is forced upon him. We are in touch again the following week, after all, and speak remotely. His attitude is consistent. “In the bigger picture this is just my leg, and it is just football, even though both things are pretty important to a footballer,” he says. “I am well, my family is well, and I will return to the football pitch. “I prefer to see it as a positive and rare opportunity. I’ve often had the thought about how it would be to take two or three months away from matches, both to be creative about optimising my game and making my body stronger. Normally that’s never possible in a career. I’d rather not have been injured but I have to accept it, work to get over it and get out as a stronger version of myself.” Kjær has incentives to do that: there is a Scudetto to win and a World Cup in which to lead Denmark, whose armband he has worn since 2016. Back in Helsingør, he drills into the mentality that has brought him this far. He came through the youth system at Midtjylland, where his father, Jørn, was kit man until retiring in February, and had the culture shock of joining Palermo when he was 19. Stops at Wolfsburg, Roma, Lille, Fenerbahce, Sevilla and Atalanta followed: it was a fine, if undulating, club career that became outstanding after he signed for Milan last year. “In my mind I’m a guy who grew up in a small city and my feet are solidly planted on the ground,” he says. “But sometimes you have to be a little bit arrogant, a little bit ignorant, about your own capabilities because it will push you a little bit more. If you’re playing against Messi or Ronaldo, they are probably better than you. But if you know that every day you work your ass off, you can tell yourself: ‘Who is a better defender in the world than me right now?’ A few, maybe a little bit more, but under the right conditions … I believe I’m the best, I have to believe that. If not I never will be, and I will never give 100%.” Kjær speaks softly and deliberately, his answers lengthy but clear. It is not difficult to see how he might carry a squad with him. Denmark has a population of 5.8m and, from the outside, its stream of top-level footballers have exuded a palpable toughness in defying limitations of size. It could be simplistic to twin that with their response to such shocking adversity last summer but the question seems worthwhile: what makes a Danish footballer tick? “Overall we’re very respectful, educated people,” he says. “If you take 100 Danish players from around the world, maybe one will be a little nuts, but I think you’ll find parallels between all of us. You’re brought up to be very independent, learn to take care of yourself, learn to be polite. You learn attitude and confidence is a good thing, but not too much. You appreciate and earn your respect, never taking anything for granted. We’re very direct, we’re very honest, and I think that is very important.” Those qualities forge the ties that bind. On the pitch they have been augmented by genuine excellence. Kjær and Denmark qualified for Qatar 2022 at a canter; they have secured their place when we meet, but beat the Faroe Islands two days later for a ninth straight victory. Even without Eriksen, their undoubted star, they can be backed for at least a quarter-final place. In October 2020, Kjær and Eriksen won their 100th caps in a Nations League win at Wembley. Only eight other players had achieved that for Denmark and it is a small, apt snapshot of the journey they have undertaken together. The symmetry when they ended up in Milan, Eriksen playing for Internazionale, delighted both men. Eriksen has since departed and is training with Odense, where he played as a teenager, as he discerns whether a return to professional football will be possible. The happiest coincidence was short-lived, but it was one episode in something far more profound. “I speak a lot with Christian,” Kjær says. “It’s been my therapy. If I know Christian is OK, then I’m OK; if he’s good, I’m good.” Outside, the beams over the water are becoming sharper; hundreds of invisible figures are returning to the places they know. “Of course I have things I struggle with, and I will always struggle with them. But with time, and if I can see Christian and his family are good, then I am too. That is where I find my peace in it, and that is enough for me.”",Sport/Sport,The Guardian Footballer of the Year Simon Kjær: ‘Football has become secondary for me’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/31/the-guardian-footballer-of-the-year-2021-simon-kjaer-denmark-interview
1/1/2022,"With an impeccable sense of timing, Ashley Giles flies into Sydney next week to join up with the England squad ahead of the fourth Ashes Test. I know what you’re all thinking: if only he’d arrived earlier. How differently things might have panned out had the “Managing Director, England Men’s Cricket” been able to effect his unique brand of managerial direction earlier in the series? Perhaps, like Glenn McGrath in 2005 or John Snow in 1974-75, the Giles Effect (Conjecture) seems fated to remain an arresting counterfactual in the footnotes of Ashes history. Instead, Giles arrives with the Ashes gone and English cricket in varying states of disarray. The captain, Joe Root, is said to be quietly seething at the manner of this defeat and the entirely foreseeable missteps that have led to it. Chris Silverwood, the man whom Giles decided to make the most powerful England coach of the 21st century, will probably end up leaving his job. However Tom Harrison, Giles’s boss and the chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board, still gets his share of a £2m bonus pot. So let’s charitably call it a mixed picture.  Of course, such is the level of public anger at this latest Ashes debacle that it is not entirely beyond the realms of possibility that all four of the above could be out of a job in the next few weeks. Silverwood feels the likeliest to go; Giles as the man who appointed him might also find himself dispensable collateral; Root will probably be given the right to go on his own terms should he wish; Harrison is beginning to show the strain of almost seven years at the helm, to the point where he has largely ceased being able to communicate in coherent English sentences. For fans and pundits still stinging from the manner of this latest Ashes debacle, perhaps this would classify as a necessary purgation, a long-overdue cleansing of the stables: an opportunity to burn down the entire festering structure and build something afresh. Which feels instinctively right at a time like this, with England’s defeat widely being described as their worst in Ashes history. And yet perhaps the real lesson of this series is not about who needs to go, but who needs to come in. After all this is – by recent standards, at least – a remarkably thin top team, consisting of no chairman, no chief selector or full-time selection panel, and a bare minimum of coaching staff. Silverwood’s absence from the Sydney Test after a close contact tested positive for Covid has merely underlined the paucity of coaching expertise on tour. Paul Collingwood has left to concentrate on the white-ball tour of the West Indies, Jeetan Patel and Jon Lewis are also isolating, and so pretty much the entire setup is currently in the hands of assistant coach Graham Thorpe. In a way this is a pretty good metaphor for the organisation as a whole: a setup that has been brain‑drained, hollowed out from the inside. It is no secret that the last two years have had a punishing impact on the ECB’s finances. Staff have been furloughed and laid off. Reserves have been whittled down. Programmes have been cut. The official selection panel has been trimmed from four in 2018 to just one: Silverwood, whose latest brainwave was to leave out both Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad on a green wicket in Brisbane. Perhaps some of the pruning was necessary: certainly there have been times in the past when Team England on tour felt more like a circus. But these days there seems to be a distinct absence of expertise at the heart of the setup: the innovation and imagination and life experience and variety of voices that moves a team forward, rather than simply keeping it running. For all his faults national selector Ed Smith was one such voice: a man prepared to embrace the heterodox, posit the wacky idea, imagine the world a shade of Joe Denly. Andy Flower was another, and the decision to retain his services as Lions coach after the 2013-14 Ashes was a quietly inspired move. But perhaps the biggest loss was Sir Andrew Strauss, the man responsible for remaking English cricket twice: first as captain from 2009 to 2011, and then as director from 2015 to 2018, where he put in place the white-ball-oriented strategy that helped England win their first men’s World Cup. This is not to argue that any of them is necessarily the right man right now, or that any of the current occupants necessarily deserve to stay. The broader point is that any successful team needs a surfeit of hard thought as well as hard work, an ability to see round corners and approach problems in new ways. With respect to both, neither Silverwood nor Giles really fit the bill: the latter having overseen a gentle regression of the white-ball side as coach from 2012-14, the former now having done the same to the Test side. In Silverwood’s determination to “take the positives” from England’s third Test defeat there were echoes of Giles’s infamous claim in the wake of the humiliating defeat to the Netherlands at the 2014 World T20 that England had “warmed up well”. They are middle managers, factotums, details men, personally admirable and perfectly competent. They are the bread and cheese of any self-respecting organisation. But you also need people who aspire to more. Instead, Silverwood and Giles were given the keys to the palace, and in the process we learned a good deal about the ECB’s attitude to Test cricket. That with a base level of competence it would essentially look after itself, while the more viable revenue streams were explored instead: 50-over, 20-over, 100-ball. Replacing the men themselves will be easy enough. Replacing the philosophy they embodied will be several degrees harder.",Sport/Sport,English cricket must aspire to more than Giles’s brand of middle management | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/31/cricket-england-test-ashley-giles-middle-management-chris-silverwood

1/1/2022,"The conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell on sex-trafficking charges this week has increased the scrutiny of others who worked for or socialized with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein for years, and their knowledge of the pair’s activities. Attention has largely focused on prominent male associates of Epstein, including Prince Andrew, who faces a civil suit brought by Virginia Roberts Giuffre. Giuffre alleges the Queen’s son had sex with her on three occasions two decades ago when, aged 17, she had been sexually trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, allegations Andrew vehemently denies.  Four Epstein employees and assistants were described in a 2007 non-prosecution agreement as “potential co-conspirators” when Epstein pleaded guilty to solicitation in Florida in return for a lenient sentence. Giuffre has said she hopes Maxwell’s conviction “is not the end but rather another step in justice being served. Maxwell did not act alone. Others must be held accountable.” After Epstein’s arrest and suicide in 2019, the US attorney’s office said that it was not bound by the Florida agreement that named the four women – Sarah Kellen, Lesley Groff, Adriana Ross and Nada Marcinkova – and said they could be subject to criminal charges. All have denied involvement or knowledge of the Epstein-Maxwell abuses. Maxwell, 60, who was found guilty on Wednesday of facilitating the abuse of underage girls for Epstein, had argued she was covered by the non-prosecution agreement, but her argument was rejected by presiding Judge Alison Nathan. Kellen, 41, who is now married to an American race car driver, is the most prominent of the four women, but has claimed she was also a victim of Epstein. Kellen was accused by lawyers in legal filings years ago of “bringing girls to Epstein’s mansion to be abused”. Kellen’s name came up in witness testimony during the prosecution phase of Maxwell’s trial, when the government’s key witness, known as “Carolyn”, alleged that Kellen scheduled her sexualized massages with Epstein and paid her $500 to pose for a naked photograph when she was 14 or 15 years old. Kellen, who has changed her name, was not called to testify, suggesting she was not cooperating with government prosecutors. Maxwell’s defense team contented that Kellen was among several potential witnesses “who the government could have charged, criminally, based on the testimony we heard”. Groff was Epstein’s New York-based assistant for 20 years. Earlier in December, a civil case against Groff brought by Jennifer Araoz, who had accused Epstein of sexually abusing her at his mansion in New York City in 2001 and 2002, was dropped. According to Groff’s attorneys, Michael Bachner and Jon Whitcomb, federal prosecutors have no plans to bring charges against her at this time. “After a more than two-year investigation by the Department of Justice into Jeffrey Epstein’s conduct, which included lengthy interviews of witnesses and a thorough review of relevant communications, we have been informed that no criminal charges will be brought against Lesley Groff,” Bachner and Whitcomb said in a statement provided to the Guardian. Groff’s attorneys added that their client had “never witnessed anything improper or illegal”. Groff’s lawyers said that she worked from the Madison Avenue offices, and never stepped foot in Epstein’s personal home. Her duties, they said, included making appointments for Epstein, taking his messages, and setting up high-level meetings with “CEOs, business executives, scientists, politicians, celebrities, charitable organizations and universities” and had “no knowledge and no participation in any of these horrific crimes”. Groff “remains heartbroken for Jennifer and all of the victims,” Whitcomb said. Ross, a former model from Poland who moved to Florida in 2002, was hired to work at the financier’s mansion. Ross, also known as Adriana Mucinska, often flew on the financier’s private jet, according to flight records. Asked during civil litigation about how the Epstein conspiracy operated – and if Prince Andrew had ever been involved with under-age women, Ross repeatedly invoked her fifth amendment rights against self-incrimination. Marcinkova is now a pilot and has changed her name. According to police records reported by the Guardian in 2015, one alleged victim claimed that she was told Marcinkova had been bought from her parents in eastern Europe by Epstein when she was 15. One alleged that she was made to have sex with Marcinkova and to watch her have sex with Epstein. Marcinkova has since changed her last name. Bennett Gershman, a professor of law at Pace University in New York, told the Guardian that he has doubts the government plans to prosecute others. “Yes, there are potential new defendants and the government knows that. It’s at the prosecutor’s discretion whether to go forward to prosecute further or whether they feel having convicted Maxwell that’s going to close the book on the prosecution of Epstein and the things Epstein and Maxwell did together.”",News/US news,Maxwell conviction increases scrutiny of other women who worked for Epstein,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/31/ghislaine-maxwell-convinction-increases-scrutiny-epstein-employees
