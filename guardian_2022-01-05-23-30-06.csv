1/5/2022,"Kazakhstan’s president has threatened to crack down ruthlessly on protests ongoing across the country, claiming the unrest has led to deaths and injuries among law enforcement officers. “As the head of state … I plan to act as toughly as possible,” said Kassym-Jomart Tokayev in a televised address on Wednesday afternoon. “This is a question of the safety of our country. I am certain that the people will support me,” he added, saying he had no plans to flee the country’s capital.  Earlier on Wednesday, Tokayev accepted the resignation of the government and introduced a state of emergency in several provinces in an attempt to claw back control over the situation, but the moves failed to deter angry crowds. The protests began in the west of the country at the weekend, sparked by a sharp rise in fuel prices, but have spread quickly and taken both the country’s authorities and international observers by surprise. In Almaty, the country’s commercial capital and largest city, there were violent clashes between police and demonstrators and the mayoralty was set on fire, with smoke and flames visible from several floors of the imposing building. In other cities, including Aktobe in the west of the country, crowds tried to storm government buildings. There were reports and videos of police cars set on fire and security vehicles seized by the crowd. “The authorities are trying everything to calm things down, with a mix of promises and threats, but so far it’s not working,” said Dosym Satpayev, an Almaty-based political analyst. “There will be imitations of dialogue but essentially the regime will respond with force, because they have no other tools.” Tokayev has blamed the protests on “destructive individuals who want to undermine the stability and unity of our society”. At times, authorities have shut down mobile internet and blocked access to messaging apps, and on Wednesday afternoon the internet went down across much of the country. Authorities said army units had been brought into Almaty to restore order. Images of police being overpowered by protesters are likely to cause alarm in the Kremlin, as another country neighbouring Russia succumbs to political unrest. Kazakhstan is part of an economic union with Russia and the two countries share a long border. “We hope for the earliest possible normalisation of the situation in the country, with which Russia is linked by relations of strategic partnership and alliance through fraternal, human contacts,” said the Russian foreign ministry in a statement. Dmitry Peskov, spokesperson for Vladimir Putin, said it was important no foreign countries interfered in Kazakhstan. The trigger for protests was a sharp rise in the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), used by many to power their cars, particularly in the west of Kazakhstan. They began over the weekend in the oil city of Zhanaozen, where in December 2011 police fired on protesters killing at least 16 people. It soon became clear that the anger was not narrowly focused on LPG prices, and a government announcement that the price would be fixed at a lower level has done nothing to quell the protest. Instead, there is broader discontent with Tokayev, president since 2019, and his 81-year-old benefactor, Nursultan Nazarbayev. A former Soviet-era communist boss who became Kazakhstan’s first president after independence in 1991 and ruled until 2019, Nazarbayev still wields immense power behind the scenes. During his rule over the resource-rich country, a small elite has become fantastically wealthy while many ordinary Kazakhs live in poverty. “Nazarbayev and his family have monopolised all sectors from banking, to roads, to gas. These protests are about corruption,” said 55-year-old Zauresh Shekenova, who has been protesting in Zhanaozen since Sunday. “It all started with the increase in gas prices but the real cause of the protests is poor living conditions of people, high prices, joblessness, corruption,” she added. Tokayev declared a state of emergency in large parts of the country overnight, but this did not stop crowds coming onto the streets on Wednesday. Darkhan Sharipov, an activist from the civil society movement Wake Up, Kazakhstan, said a group of about 70 activists had set off to march to the centre of Almaty on Tuesday night, but many of them were detained and held at a police station for several hours. “People are sick of corruption and nepotism, and the authorities don’t listen to people … We want President Tokayev to carry out real political reforms, or to go away and hold fair elections,” he said. While it is clear there is widespread discontent in the country, the cleansing of the political playing field over many years means there are no high-profile opposition figures around which a protest movement could unite. Instead, the protests appear largely directionless “There are some local figures, but nobody who could unify forces across the country, though with time they could appear,” said Satpayev. The five former Soviet Central Asian republics have been largely devoid of protest in their three decades of independence, with the exception of Kyrgyzstan, which has had several revolutions. The other four have been ruled by autocrats who have ruthlessly cracked down on any sign of protest. Nazarbayev was once considered the most canny of these rulers and was widely popular, but over time the lack of economic progress or political reform has led to rising discontent.",News/World news,Kazakhstan protests: president threatens ruthless crackdown,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/kazakhstan-protests-president-threatens-ruthless-crackdown
1/5/2022,"Reduced timetables are to be brought in across Great Britain’s entire railway network by the middle of this month to deal with Covid staff shortages and to match falling passenger numbers. Train operators said passengers should check before they travel, with more companies due to introduce temporary timetables after moves from ScotRail, LNER and others in December.  The industry body the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) said the reduced schedules would be introduced by 16 January for every operator to make services more resilient and reliable for passengers. The RDG said the changes would also offer better value for taxpayers in the face of declining usage and fare revenue during the pandemic. It did not give a date for when normal service would resume. However, unions warned that the current crisis around the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant should not be used as cover for long-term cuts, while passenger representatives called for first and last services to be maintained throughout. High levels of staff absence during the latest wave of Covid infections led a number of operators to cancel services in the run-up to Christmas, starting with ScotRail, which was particularly affected because of Scotland’s rules on self-isolation for contacts as well as infected people. ScotRail brought in a temporary reduced weekday timetable this week, with 150 fewer services a day. CrossCountry has cut about 50 trains a day, while Southern will not run trains to its normal London terminus, Victoria, for the rest of the week. Transport for Wales and Greater Anglia have switched to amended timetables, while TransPennine Express, South Western, Northern and others are warning of short-notice service changes. The RDG’s director of people, operations and railway strategy, Susie Homan, said: “The temporary timetables that rail companies are putting in place, with government support, will help ensure more reliable services with fewer short-notice cancellations so that we can continue to get people and goods to where they need to be. “The government has supported the railway with over £15bn since the start of the pandemic, and it makes sense to better match the number of trains that are running with the number of people travelling, so that the industry gets the most out of every taxpayer pound and doesn’t take more than its fair share of public money.” Official figures show passenger numbers had fallen back to just over 50% of pre-pandemic levels before Christmas. However, the TSSA union demanded guarantees that the cuts would only last for the duration of the Omicron wave, with the instruction to work from home where possible making passenger numbers fall rapidly. The general secretary, Manuel Cortes, said: “We really fear that the Tory government is using temporary timetables as cover to reduce services so they can then implement cuts of £2bn on our railways.” He said the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, should “give passengers copper-bottomed guarantees that rail services will return back to their pre pandemic level as soon as we have any kind of return to normality”, adding: “Failure to do so would be a clear signal of what many fear are this government’s real intentions – cutting train services.” The RMT general secretary, Mick Lynch, said: “No one should underestimate the impact that Covid is having on transport staff and there is a logic to adjusting services accordingly. However, any attempt to use this crisis to cynically bulldoze through permanent cuts to services and staffing levels would meet the stiffest resistance from this trade union.” The passenger watchdog Transport Focus said that amending timetables was a pragmatic response if it would prevent chaotic last-minute cancellations. However, Anthony Smith, the chief executive, added: “Services must still meet the needs of those who have to travel, especially key sector workers. “Operators must protect first and last services, provide enough space to keep passengers at a safe distance from each other, and flexibility so that tickets can be used on alternative routes or times.”",News/Business,Reduced timetables to come in on all of Great Britain’s rail network,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/05/reduced-timetables-rail-network-great-britain
1/5/2022,"Everton have appointed the club legend Graeme Sharp to their board as a non-executive director. Sharp, the second-highest goalscorer in Everton’s history and a club ambassador since 2000, will be involved in all football-related decisions but is not a replacement for the former director of football Marcel Brands.  It is understood Sharp’s appointment to the board was planned before Brands left Everton last month amid widespread criticism of Farhad Moshiri’s ownership. Everton announced a strategic review into all levels of their football operation after Brands’ departure and that remains ongoing. Sharp, 61, will continue in his role as the club’s players’ life president but relinquish his other duties to work on the board. The former Scotland international said: “This club is in my blood. Joining the board and being able to play a part in shaping Everton’s future is one of the greatest honours of all. I look forward to working with my fellow board members and take my responsibility as a custodian of our great club very seriously.”",Sport/Football,‘This club is in my blood’: Everton legend Graeme Sharp joins board,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/05/everton-legend-graeme-sharp-joins-board
1/5/2022,"There’s a moment in The Lost Daughter, Maggie Gyllenhaal’s adaptation of the Elena Ferrante novel which stars Olivia Colman, where I gasped out loud and swore at the character. Colman’s Leda, a professor holidaying in Greece alone, is conversing awkwardly with a pregnant stranger. “Children are a crushing responsibility,” she says, by way of a conversational coda. The bluntness of Colman’s delivery meant that I was laughing as I gasped, but still: everyone knows it to be on some level true, but you don’t go around saying such things to pregnant women. Or at least, you shouldn’t.  The Netflix film is a fairly faithful adaptation of the 2006 novel; it holds the same capacity to shock while bringing out new feelings and elucidations. The moment in the film where one of Leda’s daughters cuts her finger and repeatedly begs her mother – a younger Leda, played by Jessie Buckley – to kiss it better, is far more emotionally affecting than when described in the slim, interior novel. “Poor creatures who came out of my belly,” Leda narrates in the book, and as a cinematic audience at times we are inclined to agree with her. Because what sort of mother abandons her children, as Leda does? Is maternal ambivalence still a taboo? Some insist that it is, though a woman failing to love her children as society deems she should is hardly a new story, either in literature or reality. Maternal cruelty is still shocking, whether it comes in the form of a performance of Medea or another heartbreaking headline case of child murder or neglect. For some, even having mixed feelings about motherhood warrants punishment. Rachel Cusk’s 2015 adaptation of Medea at the Almeida theatre featured a chorus of “conforming yummy mummies”; Cusk herself was castigated by such a chorus for A Life’s Work, her 2001 book which committed the crime of being honest about how exhausting and miserable it was to have a baby who cried unceasingly (hardly a controversial revelation, or at least not by today’s standards). “Again and again people judged the book not as readers but as mothers,” Cusk later wrote. In recent years there has been a proliferation of awareness-raising about maternal ambivalence, especially postnatal depression. Courageous women have spoken out and written about it, defying what Cusk describes as the tendency of the communal to prevail over the individual when it comes to motherhood. These women are brave because the voices that contradict a powerful cultural myth are so often castigated. Eventually these voices formed their own chorus, and the taboo itself is weakening, or at least it seems that way to me. Yet these works maintain an emotional force, perhaps because now, with our greater understanding, we know just how close so many mothers have come to being driven mad by it. Perhaps, we worry, our own mothers were. It is not a comfortable feeling, and The Lost Daughter is not a comfortable film. Leda is not held up for judgment by us, though at times the audience may of course judge her. In a recent adaptation of Nancy Mitford’s The Pursuit of Love, maternal abandonment is played for laughs in the form of the character of “The Bolter”, Fanny’s mother, who flees any form of commitment. It is tonally entirely different to The Lost Daughter, but again, simple judgment is the least interesting reaction one can have. It feels less scandalous, these days, to admit that women can have other interests besides childrearing, and that finding a way to reconcile making art, in particular, with the division of domestic labour is a worthy source of creative exploration. Works such as Lara Feigel’s Free Woman, which explores Doris Lessing’s maternal ambivalence (she abandoned two of her children) as well as her own, have added to this conversation, as have novels by Sheila Heti, Jenny Offill, and Avni Doshi, among others. Yet the death of Joan Didion saw a resurgence of the Caitlin Flanagan article in which she puts Didion’s childcare arrangements under the microscope. “Where was Quintana when Didion was living at the Faculty Club, or finishing her novels at her parents’ house, or bunking down in the Haight”, Flanagan asks. “Not with her mother.” Those four words drip with judgment. “The children stared at me,” Leda narrates towards the end of the novel The Lost Daughter. “I felt their gazes longing to tame me, but more brilliant was the brightness of life outside them, new colours, new bodies, new intelligence, a language to possess finally as if it were my true language, and nothing, nothing that seemed to me reconcilable with that domestic space from which they stared at me in expectation.” Ferrante remains the empress of maternal ambivalence. It comes down to language. In The Days of Abandonment, the narrator Olga describes the experience of breastfeeding: “I was like a lump of food that my children chewed without stopping, a cud made of a living material that continually amalgamated and softened its living substance to allow two greedy bloodsuckers to nourish themselves.” To read such words still feel like a forceful, visceral refutation, a scream in the face of the prevailing narrative. Many women will no doubt read those lines and reflect, “that isn’t how it was for me.” But I hope that we are moving away from a place where one woman’s experience is taken to automatically undermine another’s. Most women will not abandon their children as Leda does, but many of us know that a more complex rendering of motherhood on screen and on the page can only be a good thing for us all. After all, it is when feelings are deemed unutterable that they become suffocating.

1/5/2022,"When Stuart Broad took David Warner’s edge on the first day of the Sydney Test, into the slip cordon to be safely clasped, it felt like something clicked into place. This was the scent of a familiar dish, or YouTubing a favourite scene from a movie. The reassurance of the familiar, and the rightness of something that should be just so. At the same time, there was the unmistakable sense that thousands of people across the world were shouting at their television sets that they had told you so, or told someone so, and why had nobody listened?  Warner’s 2019 Ashes immolation at the torch of Broad is the stuff of forever. Ten innings, 95 runs, a single-figure series average. Among cricket lovers, it lives on with the potency and permanence of a race memory. Broad was the tormentor for seven dismissals of the 10, coming around the wicket to the left-hander, angling the ball in, using his mastery of English conditions to make it seam and swing from a length so full as to be always threatening. Sometimes it came in to hit pads or stumps, sometimes away to take the outside edge, even drawing nicks when an increasingly flummoxed Warner tried to leave the ball. In the current series, then, when Broad was left out in Brisbane and in Melbourne, there was widespread bewilderment. Why would England forgo the weapon that could wipe out Australia’s prolific opener? Perhaps because it was a different year in a different country. The bowler had twice before played series against Warner in Australia. Across all five Tests in 2017-18, Broad didn’t dismiss him once, while Warner repeatedly set the tone and averaged 63. In 2013-14, Broad got him four times, but only after the opener had made enough runs to average 58. Even previous series in England had not gone Broad’s way: no wicket in 10 attempts in 2015, where Warner made five half-centuries and averaged 46; one dismissal in six innings against the junior version in 2013. In emphasising the dominance of 2019 on the one hand, you also have to concede that in all their other contests, Warner has played 15 Tests for six Broad dismissals, three centuries, 12 half centuries, and an average of nearly 49. But it could have been different at the Gabba, right? Where Broad got him out twice in 2013? Yes, got him out for 49 and 124. Admittedly the 2021 Gabba had greenness and juice in the surface, and that duel could have been compelling. The question about whether there was a psychological hangover from 2019 would have been tested. Audiences were denied the intrigue of that contest, and that is a shame in itself. It doesn’t mean the whole series would have been different. Broad bowled to Warner the next week instead, in Adelaide. Warner made 95. Even if Broad had been picked in Brisbane, England would presumably have stuck to the plan of batting first. Which brings us back to the problem that England’s batting is currently nowhere near the standard to function in international cricket. Broad’s prowess with the stick would not have improved upon Brisbane’s first-day debacle. Among all of the argument that has played out before and during each Test about the choice of bowlers, England have had a batting collapse in every innings: 10 for 147, eight for 74, eight for 86, nine for 144, eight for 124, and 10 for 68. Stuart Broad can’t change that. Stuart Broad can’t defend that. Wasim Akram, Malcolm Marshall, and Robocop fused with a bowling machine can’t defend that. Even bowling magic cannot transform batting coal into gold. So when one old combatant dismissed the other on the first day at the SCG, there was an echo of what might have been had they gone head to head to start the series. There was also an echo of what might have been had the work of Broad and company been given support by the rest of their team. That edge into the slip cordon could be the starting point of a mighty bowling surge on the second day, and it still won’t matter a jot of ink in the scorebook unless England can find some runs to go with it. Broad bowling to Warner in Brisbane was never going to change everything. It can’t change anything unless something else changes first.",Sport/Sport,Broad’s Ashes dismissal of Warner reminds fans what might have been | Geoff Lemon,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/05/broad-warner-ashes-fans-england-australia
1/5/2022,"Like many great adventures, Tux and Fanny begins on a quiet afternoon. Our two oddly named protagonists decide that they would like to play a game of football, but disaster strikes: the ball is flat. Our quest is simple – find a way to reinflate the football. Can we find a pump? This first challenge is the route towards hundreds of other tiny mysteries in the labyrinthine world of Tux and Fanny’s house and surrounding gardens, each stranger and more delightful than the last. There is a tree growing up through the floor. The antenna on the roof is broken. There is a door in the wall where there shouldn’t be and strange figures are coming through. All is absolutely not what it seems. To categorise this as a point-and-click adventure, or an exploration game, or a puzzle game feels wrong, though it incorporates elements of all three genres while subverting them at every turn. The player wanders around as Tux, Fanny, the cat or the flea that lives on the cat’s back, and even the rewards for your problem-solving have a dreamlike feel to them. Some puzzles contain whole worlds of their own: an entire readable copy of Moby-Dick is hidden on the shelf, as are many tiny comics and zines that are a joy to browse through. There is a plethora of micro-games, found on floppy disks around the house and garden, which you can play on the desktop computer in the living room. These micro-games have silly names such as Skull Legs and Puzzle Tractor, but they are purposeful and even occasionally poetic in their execution.  The visual style is noteworthy – it changes often, depending on which of the many queries we as players are trying to solve. Sometimes it is a simple, blocky pixelated world. Sometimes it is animated in watercolour, sometimes computer-generated, sometimes it is stop-motion, sometimes it is all of those things at once. It is never the same for long. Tux and Fanny began as a long series of tiny films by director and writer Albert Birney. It feels very personal, which tempers the surrealism and grounds what is a weird experience. The stranger parts of the game are sometimes the most poignant: the narrative journey of the flea on the cat’s back is quite moving, for example, which caught me off guard. While we might find the pump for the football early enough in the long and surprising afternoon we are playing through, we find many other incredible things. We categorise birds, paint and sell pictures on the internet, float down a river on a tyre and shatter the fabric of reality and paste it back together.

1/5/2022,"To call Omicron’s rise in the UK “precipitate” is to violently understate matters. Daily case counts have broken the record set just the day before over and over again. Yesterday they hit over 218,000. Amid such an astonishing surge of infection, consequences are unavoidable. Despite consistent evidence suggesting that Omicron causes somewhat less severe illness, especially in vaccinated and boosted people, numbers like this wreak their own havoc.  Even if Omicron were half as virulent as Delta, but infected four times as many people, twice as fast, that’s still a wrecking ball aimed at a teetering healthcare system. The NHS is already seeing staff shortages from illness and quarantine, and weighing the possibility of reducing or cancelling services. Businesses are similarly struggling. And customers seeking to avoid infection are voting with their feet. Boxing day sales traffic in London was down 67% from pre-pandemic levels in some areas, showing that you don’t need a lockdown to have an economic impact. The virus will do it for you. Amid the inquests into how the UK came to be caught flat-footed yet again in the face of a new variant, there’s the pressing question about what to do right now. The single most important thing at the moment is boosters. And at least a first dose for anyone who inexplicably is yet to receive one. Protection from severe infection among those who have been boosted appears very good, and we think it kicks in quickly. We are in a race with Omicron here, and anything that slows down the virus helps. Decreasing the overall rate of new cases will mean more people get boosted before they are infected. And if fewer people are infected there will also be more people available to deliver the shots and do other vital work. But while vaccines are the most important part of the strategy to blunt Omicron’s impact, they are not enough by themselves. We still need to support isolation for those infected, quarantine for those exposed, rapid tests to identify cases, and promote masking in public places. All of these need urgent support from the government. Frankly, it’s a travesty that amid all the events of the last two years there’s isn’t yet mandatory sick pay, and generous support for anyone who needs to isolate after testing positive for Covid. The shortening of isolation requirements to 7 days following a positive test – along with two negative antigen tests – might not be perfect, but it is defensible if we are seeking to maintain a workforce and avoid a shutdown of society by default, and to maintain essential services. Early evidence suggests that for many Omicron breakthrough cases, the period of infectiousness is shorter. So even if a person is still shedding detectable virus, they may be a low infection risk to others. Indeed, rapid antigen tests are widely believed to be a guide, if an imperfect one, to whether a person is currently infectious – even if they don’t catch every Covid case. So making them widely available will also help avoid further infection from any people shedding virus for a longer period. These tests are useful, but likely to be in short supply – as seen over the Christmas period. If that happens, we must consider when they are most effective. Infections in young people are less likely to be serious than those in older people. So rapid tests are best used to avoid introducing the virus to vulnerable older networks. Use one before seeing older relatives – and just before. The rate with which viral load – and thus infectivity – can increase with Omicron is impressive. And the longer the period since your last negative test, the less likely you are still negative. On top of that, everyone should be issued with a good quality mask and instructions on how to use it when indoors in public. There is no reason the government could not do this, but masks have become a flashpoint in the culture wars. The politicisation of mask use makes about as much sense as politicising gravity. Concerns from some infectious disease professionals about improper mask use are also misplaced. A bunch of people using unfitted N95s and not trained in their use, will still transmit far less to each other than a group using cloth masks or worse, nothing at all. Any prescriptions for how to slow Omicron will be met, I am sure, with fury from those determined to pretend either that the virus does not exist or that its consequences are minor. I appeal to those people to talk to the dedicated healthcare staff who have worked to save the lives of those suffering from Covid throughout the pandemic. Every booster that reaches a person before Omicron does, helps them. All the ferment and fury about the damage of lockdowns, usually from profoundly uninformed sources, many of whom are not acting in good faith, has always missed an essential point. Epidemiologists like myself have always been about reducing harm. Like risk, we cannot eliminate harm entirely, but we can takes steps to avoid the very worst consequences. These measures should accomplish that. Data from South Africa shows that as rapidly as Omicron hits, it starts to decline shortly thereafter. And so at least we think the surge will be short, and before the spring it will be largely in the rearview mirror. It won’t be pretty, but it will be quick.

1/5/2022,"Influence is not a word readily associated with St Jacques, the Gypsy quarter of the city of Perpignan. Yet, on a recent chilly night shortly before 8pm, the ineffable hand of influence is behind an outbreak of street theatre on the plane tree-lined oblong of Place Cassanyes. People are arriving in droves. By 7.50pm, there must be more than 200, mostly young men, in rowdy clusters. Smoking, yelling, stretching, one group doing can-can legs: it’s like Fast & Furious without the automobiles. One man in a red Adidas tracksuit is trying to line everyone up across the square’s breadth. A beacon in a sea of dark casual-wear, the influencer known as NasDas – St Jacques born and bred – is responsible for this circus. The previous night, NasDas posted to his 1.2 million followers a picture of one of his posse holding up a crinkled €500 bill, followed by footage of a previous Place Cassanyes footrace. Tonight is a rerun, only with a bigger prize. But this time the turnout is far bigger, too. Streaming live on Snapchat, he’s antsy: “On my mother’s life, I didn’t expect this kind of crowd – from Avignon, from Marseille, from everywhere.”  NasDas – real name Nasser Sari – has achieved the feat of becoming France’s No 1 Snapchat influencer from one of the country’s poorest neighbourhoods. Perpignan is the last French Mediterranean city 20 miles (32km) north of the Spanish border; rising up a hill at the back of its town centre is St Jacques, a tightly packed, roughneck enclave on a medieval street grid where 60% of households live in poverty. Three-quarters of a population numbering somewhere 3,000 and 7,000 are Catalan Gypsies; the remainder, coexisting sometimes tensely with their neighbours, are Arab – including the 25-year-old NasDas, whose parents emigrated from Algeria. When outsiders go to St Jacques, they often see only the omnipresent rubbish. But NasDas saw life, beauty and humour in his daily surroundings. A few years ago, he began shooting the street shenanigans and characters around him: “I didn’t want to be No 1, or even to be a Snapchatter or an influencer. I’d just get my phone out at the cafe: ‘Who’s going to pay? You? You never pay!’ And I realised that people liked watching my daily life.” He began adding semi-dramatised skits, like one spoofing banlieue arrivisme, in which his posse abscond to Barcelona with his credit card and hit the luxury boutiques – while he receives a stream of obscene receipts on his smartphone back home. By mid-2020, his sly observations and charm had won him tens of thousands of followers. Caught in a smartphone window, NasDas has a genial, almost Fozzie Bear-ish charisma riffing with his catchphrase: “La chiennété!” (which translates as something like “Doglife”). Strangely, among France’s many influencers, hardly any are chronicling its quartiers populaires (working-class neighbourhoods) like this. “You go on Snapchat, and it’s people in thongs, next to luxury buildings and nice cars – all the same things,” says NasDas’s manager, a 32-year-old who appears in the videos anonymously as the “masked man”. There are rappers, dancers, humorists and makeup artists from those places – but few instances of people simply documenting daily life. Nordine Idri, a 17-year-old from Marseille who recountined his former life as a drug-network lookout on YouTube, is another isolated example. Cinema about the cités (estates) – from La Haine to Intouchables to Girlhood – has tended to be steered by outsiders (2019’s Les Misérables was a rare high-profile example told by the residents themselves). But it seems surprising that social media, where all the technology needed fits into your pocket, hasn’t produced more chroniclers of the quartiers. Maybe the impulse in those impoverished places is more towards the aspirational kind of influencing. NasDas likes flashing the cash, too. But the extraordinary thing is that he seems to give most of it away – he forks out banknotes on his feed almost every day. By summer this year, he was Snapchat’s top influencer in France (or so he claims – Snapchat won’t confirm with exact figures) and had successfully monetised his operation with commercial contracts and product placements: for dentists, online CV apps, iced tea, luxury cars, all sorts. He estimates that he gives away about 80% of what he earns – most of it privately, he says. Developing St Jacques is his main priority; with handouts, through education (he encourages truant kids to go to school and organises street clean-ups for his Snap feed) and by promoting local businesses. The day before the race, this social-media Robin Hood sits sipping a café noisette at a table on Place Cassanyes. He is six feet tall, easygoing in the flesh compared with his antic Snapchat persona, but authoritative too. He says people coming from all over France for selfies with him proves that he has changed St Jacques’ image. As we talk, two brothers from Grenoble step up for a moment with their hero. But NasDas acknowledges that his neighbourhood won’t change overnight: “There’s a reality you shouldn’t hide. The level of violence is still quite high, unfortunately. In my eyes it’s too high, because I can’t stand violence.” In August a 23-year-old man was shot and killed outside a takeaway only metres away. On NasDas’s finger is a gold lion signet ring. Maybe it stands for his mother, whom he describes as a “lion”. She is where he gets his sense of social responsibility from; she raised him and his four siblings solo after his father died when he was 10. They lived two floors above the abandoned police station on the corner of Place Cassanyes that became St Jacques’ key drug-dealing point. Some of his peers were earning €300 a day when he was 16, but she battled to keep him out of the trade. Now, with his newfound fame, he’s taking St Jacques under his wing. At Perpignan’s funfair, the dusk sky has faded to dark ochre as the Day-Glo lights of the rides obscure the stars. Team NasDas is trying to do a “low-profile” trip, so he can chaperone his young niece and nephew. At least, as low-profile as you can be when you and your right-hand man, Samos, are dressed in matching white tracksuits. At the entrance, people are already peeking and whispering: “Il y a NasDas” (his niece is helpfully wearing a “NasDas la Chiennété” T-shirt). Soon they’re sidling up for a non-stop stream of photos. Next to the waltzers, we get bogged down by fans and well-wishers for nearly 20 minutes. “He’s so funny,” gush a couple of twentysomething local women. “He doesn’t give a damn.” During hundreds of interactions, NasDas is staunchly friendly – but there is a weary lag in his eyes. He admits he has struggled with his breakneck rise to fame, and the constant requests for money and help: “There was a point I thought I was going mad. I just wanted to go and drink a coffee like everyone else, and I couldn’t.” When he began having anxiety attacks, his managers took him out to the countryside to get things in perspective. A couple of sessions with a therapist later, he got back on the horse. Milling around him at the funfair is most of Team NasDas: Samos, the rail-thin, broken-toothed pal who often serves as his stooge in the videos; Tounsi, a burly, gruff twentysomething who is the only one NasDas was close to prior to fame; 4BDV, an urchin-like 17-year-old who looks 12 and whom NasDas took into his house after he showed up in St Jacques after crossing the Mediterranean from Algeria by boat (the influencer is applying to be his legal guardian); only Billy DZ – ill, apparently – isn’t present. Now there is an entire infrastructure supporting the team: a total of 40 people – including two Paris influencer agencies – looking after technical support, event bookings, commercial opportunities and strategy. And NasDas is sizing up the world beyond social media; he will soon appear on TV talkshows, Netflix has contacted him about a possible documentary, and he plans to perform a one-man show at Paris’s 3,000-seater Olympia venue next year. Even those things could be just the beginning. NasDas likes to use his feed to flex his social conscience, beyond handouts for the residents. He has often criticised Perpignan town hall’s management of St Jacques; dysfunctional and corrupt under previous administrations, but now with an extra vindictive edge under Louis Aliot, the only far-right Rassemblement National mayor of a major French city. The influencer recently turned his smartphone on the case of an eight-year-old taken into police custody (along with 4BDV) after being spotted on CCTV with a plastic pellet gun. Parking charges imposed in September on Place Cassanyes – which many residents can’t afford are another of NasDas’s targets. Whether it’s judicial or economic, he sees the intended effect in straightforward terms: “It’s repression.” Now that NasDas has become a public figure, the town hall has begun taking notice of him, he says. “I think they’re even more offended because I’m not asking for their help. It disturbs them: a young Maghrebin who doesn’t ask for help and succeeds in sorting out the neighbourhood.” (The town hall did not respond to requests for comment.) But he could have the perfect reply. He plans to stand for the national assembly in June elections to attempt to become one of four MPs for Pyrenées-Orientales, the département of which Perpignan is capital. “I want to shatter the cliches,” he says. “I’m young, of colour, someone who dares. I want to annoy people a bit. To show France who we are.” Pyrenées-Orientales has about 350,000 registered voters; if only a portion of NasDas’s followers vote for him, he could be Snapchatting from parliament this time next year. The pressures on NasDas aren’t just from the outside. St Jacques has a long history of unhealthy dependency on community figureheads with privileged access to power. Going back to the 1970s, there have been claims that patriarchs among some Gypsy families in St Jacques traded the community vote for political favours. Cash sums and white goods were allegedly distributed after elections; latterly jobs and influence over the long-mooted renovation of this tumbledown district. Now NasDas, through the power conferred by social media, is the one with influence – in every sense. There can be no doubting his deep solicitude for St Jacques, but you wonder whether he can withstand the pressures he will probably face from inside his neighbourhood. Just before the race, as we’re talking, he is collared by a community “big brother”, who harangues him in Arabic. Ten minutes later, he turns up again, demanding that NasDas speak to someone on the phone. What was that about? Apparently, the man is one of several intermediaries, including the man on the phone and someone else in prison, who are facilitating a product placement on Snapchat for a business in Paris. He was trying to get NasDas to lower his fee to €5,000, so he can take a larger, €3,000 cut of the original price. The influencer insists it is just an isolated case; that he experiences virtually no open jealousy, and 99.99% of St Jacques is behind him. But you suspect that this coveting of the money and publicity NasDas is generating will increase as his star rises. In any case, he is irate: “It’s the people from here who you drag you down. People in prison who drag you down.” Half an hour later, on the racetrack of Place Cassanyes, another kind of people management is required. At 8.05pm, the square is heaving. “Disperse!” insists NasDas – and the throng loiters on all four sides, trying to look as inconspicuous as 300 people gathered for the same reason can. Five minutes later, NasDas has called off the race. Three policeman on bikes are mingling among them; Tounsi reckons it’s a warning shot across the bows. With Aliot watching, there can’t be any slip-ups. The disappointed crowd starts filing away. Grinning incredulously – as if wondering how all this has happened – NasDas retreats to a cafe to stream his reactions. He’s going nowhere: “I was in St Jacques before social media, I’m here during social media, and I’ll be here afterwards too.”",News/World news,‘I want to show France who we are’: the slum influencer with his sights on parliament,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/i-want-to-show-france-who-we-are-the-slum-influencer-with-his-sights-on-parliament
1/5/2022,"Anti-fogging sprays and cloths often used to prevent condensation on eyeglasses from wearing a mask or on face shields may contain high levels of potentially toxic PFAS “forever chemicals”, according to a new study led by Duke University. Researchers tested four of the top-rated anti-fogging sprays as well as five top-rated anti-fogging cloths sold by Amazon. In all nine products, experts found fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) and fluorotelomer ethoxylates (FTEOs), two types of per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS).  PFAS have been dubbed as forever chemicals due to their longevity in the environment. “Our tests show the sprays contain up to 20.7 milligrams of PFAS per milliliter of solution, which is a pretty high concentration,” said study lead Nicholas Herkert, a postdoctoral researcher at Duke’s Nicholas School of the Environment. Exposure to some PFAs – perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) in particular – have been linked to cancer, thyroid disease, fertility complications and other health problems. Herkert noted that FTOHs and FTEOs have not been studied extensively, so scientists do not know what health risks they could pose, but research currently suggests that FTOHs inhaled or absorbed through the skin could break down in the body and become toxic, long-lasting PFAs. The FTEOs used in all four anti-fogging sprays were also analyzed in the new study and exhibited substantial cell-altering toxicity and conversion to fat cells during lab tests, said Herkert. “It’s disturbing to think that products people have been using on a daily basis to help keep themselves safe during the Covid pandemic may be exposing them to a different risk,” said Heather Stapleton, a distinguished professor of environmental chemistry and health at Duke. Stapleton initiated the study after reviewing the ingredients in a bottle of anti-fogging spray she bought for her 9-year-old daughter. Stapleton noted that the other eight products did not have their ingredients listed, making it virtually impossible to tell if they contained toxic chemicals until they were analyzed using equipment from her research laboratory. This study, conducted by Herkert and Stapleton with researchers from Duke University, Wayne State University, and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, is only the second ever to focus on FTEOS. The researchers published their peer-reviewed study on 5 January in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. Herkert and Stapleton said that more research would be needed to expand on initial findings, with larger studies involving tests on living organisms being the next step. Studies that include a larger sample size of sprays and cloths could also help identify other unknown chemicals being used in these products. “Because of Covid, more people than ever, including many medical professionals and other first-responders, are using these sprays and cloths to keep their glasses from fogging up when they wear masks or face shields,” said Stapleton. “They deserve to know what’s in the products they’re using.”",News/US news,High levels of toxic ‘forever chemicals’ found in anti-fogging sprays and wipes,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/05/pfas-forever-chemicals-anti-fogging-spray-wipes
1/5/2022,"A man who killed his younger brother with a kitchen knife after a trivial, drunken row has been told he must serve at least 21 years in jail. A court heard that William Campbell, 26, had been binge drinking vodka in the pub for more than five hours on the evening of 17 June last year. His brother Samuel, 24, had drunk at least a bottle of Jim Beam bourbon and was listening to music in the back garden of the family home in Silksworth, Sunderland.  William arrived home and was told by his mother that Samuel was waiting up to share a drink with him. Jailing Campbell for life, Judge Paul Sloan QC, the recorder of Newcastle, said what had followed was a “totally insignificant” row. He added: “It would seem that you took exception to the way your brother had been talking to his dog.” The court heard he went to the kitchen, took a sharp, sheathed knife from a drawer, returned to the garden and stabbed his brother in the chest in the presence of their mother, who had earlier tried to act as peacemaker. Defending, Nicholas Lumley QC read from a statement provided by the brothers’ father, Eddie Campbell, which described how the pair had grown up extremely close to each other. “There was sibling unrest, of course there was,” said Lumley. “But for the most part this was a loving, supportive relationship with the two of them sharing a room for so long without serious difficulty.” However, the judge said there was a history of violence which “went well beyond spats that can occur between brothers”. He also pointed to William’s initial claims that he had acted in self-defence, followed by testimony that the stabbing was accidental. A jury at Newcastle crown court last month found Campbell, a council worker of Stokesley, North Yorkshire, guilty of murder after a week-long trial. Afterwards DCI Jane Fairlamb, of Northumbria police, said: “This is a terribly sad case that has seen a family torn apart in the most devastating of circumstances.” On Wednesday, Samuel’s partner, Alice Gray, a teacher, read a statement describing how the murder had “utterly devastated my life and broken my heart beyond anything I knew possible”. She added: “I visit Sam’s grave every day and have done since he passed away. I just can’t sit at home in an empty house when he isn’t there with me.” Gray said she had been prescribed sleeping pills and antidepressants, which she had been told she may never come off. The judge said he had no doubt that Campbell, who has autism, bitterly regretted what had happened and wished to atone for it. But he said the minimum term Campbell should serve before a Parole Board could consider him for release was 21 years.",News/UK news,Man who killed brother during drunken row jailed for at least 21 years,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/05/sunderland-man-who-killed-brother-jailed
1/5/2022,"An eight-year-old girl has died and eight children have been injured after wind gusts lifted a bouncy castle metres into the air at a fair in eastern Spain. Emergency services were called to the fairgrounds in Mislata, a municipality on the outskirts of Valencia, on Tuesday evening. Minutes earlier, horrified witnesses had watched as the fair’s inflatable structure became airborne, throwing several children on to the ground, according to El País newspaper.  Nine children were taken to hospital, two of them in a serious condition. Firefighters shared photos showing pieces of the deflated castle scattered across the fairground, adding that a search had been carried out to ensure that no children were trapped in the structure. On Wednesday Mislata officials said one of the children, an eight-year-old girl, had died of her injuries. A four-year-old remains in hospital. “A very sad day for Mislata,” the city’s mayor, Carlos Fernández Bielsa, tweeted. The city declared a period of official mourning until Friday and said all remaining Christmas festivities, including a Three Kings parade planned for Wednesday, would be cancelled. “We would like to offer our sincere condolences to the family and friends of the child who lost her life. She was only eight years old,” officials said. They said police were investigating to clarify the facts and determine the responsibilities, if any, of the company that set up the fair. The death comes weeks after six children died when a gust sent a bouncy castle 10 metres (32ft) into the air in Tasmania. The incident, which under investigation, prompted calls for better regulation of safety standards on bouncy castles. “Things like this should never happen,” Prof Rebecca Ivers, the head of the school of public health at the University of New South Wales, said, adding it was well known that the structures were prone to being lifted by gusts of wind. In 2019, two children died when a tornado-like wind swept through a fair in China. In 2018, a British couple were convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence after the death of a girl on a bouncy castle in Norwich. In November, a court in Spain sentenced a couple to a year in prison after an inflatable structure at their restaurant was carried for metres by strong winds in 2017, killing a six-year-old child and injuring six others. The court found that the structure had not been fully anchored to the ground. “The tragic accident was a direct consequence of non-compliance with assembly, safety and supervisory measures,” it said.",News/World news,Girl dies and eight hurt after wind blows bouncy castle into air in Spain,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/bouncy-castle-wind-blows-valencia-spain-girl-dies
1/5/2022,"Covid-19 hospitalizations among children in the US are soaring, fueled by the Omicron variant and the holidays, and adding pressure to already-strained health systems and schools. An average of 672 children were being hospitalized every day in the US, as of 2 January - more than double the average just a week before. And the rate is rapidly increasing.  Cases are also rising. There were more than 325,000 new cases among kids in the week ending 23 December, a 64% increase from the previous week and nearly double the cases two weeks earlier, the American Academy of Pediatrics reported on Monday. Experts are urging the use of every possible precaution, including tests, masks, vaccinations and even temporary delays in reopening schools to curb both cases and staff shortages. “We have about four times as many children admitted currently as we have had in any other wave,” Dr Elaine Cox, the chief medical officer for Riley Children’s Health in Indiana, told reporters on Tuesday. They are also seeing the severity rise among the children who are admitted to the hospital, Cox said. “So there are more of them, and they are sicker.” More than half the hospitalized children have had to spend time in the intensive care unit, and at least 40% of those kids need to be put on a ventilator, she said. More than 1,000 kids have died in the US from Covid during the pandemic so far, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). More than 830,000 people have died in the US from Covid so far. In New York, hospitalizations among kids quadrupled. In Washington DC, children’s hospital admissions have roughly doubled. In Texas, children’s hospitalizations were described as “staggering”. In Alabama, cases were “like a rocket ship”. In Louisiana, one doctor said: “We’ve never seen anything like it.” In Ohio, one associate professor of internal medicine and pediatrics critical care recently told ABC news: “We’re on fire.” Hospitals are shooting past the peaks of previous surges, many of them driven by the Omicron variant. In South Africa, children and teens accounted for 17% of hospital admissions during the Omicron wave, compared to 4% during the second wave and 3.5% during the third, which was fueled by the Delta variant. Cox said she had also seen a sharp uptick in cases among pregnant people and newborns. In addition to Covid, hospitals are also seeing a dangerous wave of RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) and the flu this year, creating a triple threat of respiratory illness. At the same time, health workers are also getting breakthrough infections with omicron, creating staff shortages. “We have significant numbers of our staff who are becoming ill with Covid, so they can’t work,” Cox said. Indiana is one of the states calling in the national guard to help with hospital care and logistics. School systems across the country are also balancing soaring cases, among both students and staff, and weighing virtual options. Leaders of Chicago public schools, the country’s third-largest school network, canceled classes Wednesday after the teachers union voted to switch to remote learning due to the surge in Covid cases. In late December, Joe Biden urged the widespread use of tools to combat the virus, including tests and vaccines. “We can keep our K-through-12 schools open, and that’s exactly what we should be doing,” he said. In Washington DC, which has some of the highest rates of Covid in the country, all students and staff are now required to take a rapid test before returning to school – one of the few districts in the country with this requirement. But schools in neighboring Montgomery county, Maryland, which has also been hit hard with new cases and hospitalizations, are recommending, not requiring, tests for students and staff. Tests have been difficult to find in many places. “We have tools now that we didn’t have last year, that will allow us to keep schools open if we deploy those tools in the best possible way,” said Brian Castrucci, who is the president and CEO of the de Beaumont Foundation, a former state and local health official, and the parent to school-aged kids in Montgomery county. “We’re dealing with trying to make sure that schools are operational, that there are enough bus drivers, there are enough teachers,” Castrucci said. Educators and health officials worry that a return to school during a time of unprecedented spread could lead to the involuntary closure of schools due to staff shortages and contribute to rising cases, especially in places that aren’t able or willing to institute precautions. “It is mind-boggling some states have a [mask] mandate ban, or do not do enough to keep our kids safe,” said Tony Yang, executive director of the Center for Health Policy and Media Engagement at George Washington University, who has researched mask mandates in schools. Yang strongly favors in-person school with precautions in place. “Students should go to school in person,” he said. “But you have to do that safely.” In places where cases are particularly high, even where some precautions are in place, schools could choose to extend winter break to avoid staff shortages during the worst of the January peak, Castrucci said. “The number one thing is, we have to use every resource we have to keep kids in school in person over the long term,” he said. “And right now, we have to make a risk calculation as to whether this is the right moment to bring kids back from the holiday.” Vaccines are another key tool, said Diego Hijano, a pediatric infectious disease doctor at St Jude Children’s Research hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. “Vaccination matters in terms of hospitalization and outcomes,” he said. Most of the hospitalized kids around the country are unvaccinated, and Hijano hasn’t seen a vaccinated child hospitalized for Covid – even though he works with many children who are at risk because of other medical conditions. And hospitals overwhelmed by Covid can lead to worse care and outcomes for children suffering from other causes, he said. “If a kid has appendicitis and needs a bed for the surgery, they may not get it because the hospital is flooded with Covid,” Hijano said. “As a country and society, we shouldn’t allow even one death that could be prevented.”",News/US news,Covid hospitalizations among US children soar as schools under pressure,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/covid-hospitalizations-us-children-omicron-schools-hospitals
1/5/2022,"Shoppers in Britain had to pay more for their Christmas groceries amid a 3.5% increase in prices in December, according to retail industry figures that showed a sharp rise in the cost of beef, savoury snacks and skincare in particular.  Grocery price inflation added nearly £15 to an average monthly bill over the festive period, according to analysts at the data firm Kantar. The monthly increase was the sharpest since January 2018, bar a short period in spring 2020 when retailers suspended promotions to keep products available during panic buying at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. While the prices of some items – including fresh bacon, bath and shower products and spirits – have fallen in recent weeks, Kantar found grocery price inflation accelerated in December, up almost 1.5 percentage points on the 2.1% level seen in November. Christmas spending pushed total grocery sales to £11.7bn in the four weeks to 26 December – just 0.2% below the record established at the end of 2020, when supermarket sales benefited while pubs and restaurants faced tougher Covid restrictions in some nations of the UK. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: “People seized the chance to enjoy Christmas with friends and family after last year’s muted festivities. The data suggests that, while there weren’t formal rules in place across the UK this year, many people celebrated at home again due to Omicron.” Despite the spread of the Omicron variant, shoppers returned in greater numbers to supermarkets to fill their trolleys, with the largest number of in-store visits in December since March 2020. In comparison, online sales fell by 3.7% compared with a year earlier, accounting for just over 12% of total sales. The busiest shopping day of the year was 23 December – typically a bumper day for pre-Christmas spending. Analysts viewed this as evidence of shoppers’ confidence that supply chain disruption earlier in the year would not prevent them from being able to buy their turkey, brussels sprouts and Christmas pudding at the supermarket. Tesco, Britain’s biggest supermarket chain, maintained dominance over its rivals during the crucial Christmas trading period, increasing its market share to 27.9% over the 12 weeks to Boxing Day. This marks an increase of 0.6 percentage points on a year earlier. Retailers found it challenging to beat the record for pre-Christmas sales set in 2020, when hospitality venues had to close and could only serve takeaway food and drink in some areas of the UK. However, sales rose among all the leading supermarket chains compared with the final 12 weeks of 2019. Discounters Aldi and Lidl experienced a slight improvement to their market share, as did Waitrose. The online grocer Ocado, which has a joint venture with Marks & Spencer, was the only retailer which grew its sales compared with a year earlier. Consumers splashed out on premium ranges, taking sales of supermarkets’ own-brand luxury products to record levels, as shoppers spent £627m in December alone – an increase of almost 7% for such items compared with 2020. Traditional treats such as mince pies and chocolates proved popular, but sales of newer plant-based foods also grew before Veganuary, a period when consumers promise to only eat vegan food during the first month of the year.",News/Business,Inflation adds £15 to Britain’s Christmas groceries bills,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/05/grocery-inflation-adds-15-to-britains-christmas-bills
1/5/2022,"Twelfth night, and the following day’s Epiphany, is a time of ancient traditions: the adrenalised juggling of overdrafts, a ritual squabble with my best friend about whether frangipane, star of French Epiphany cakes, is tasty or terrible, and the dreary stripping away of any remaining Christmassy bits. Time to take down our favourites: the entirely featureless loo roll tube (a relic of some abortive “craft” project), the blue papier-mache lightbulb, origins unknown, the pink plastic owl that sees into your soul, and the inexplicable army of ornamental Scottie dogs, none of them bought by me. My husband will carefully wrap the tangled fairy lights around the ancestral copy of Super Picsou Géant (a French comic about Scrooge McDuck), as he has since time immemorial, and that will be that, fun over. There is, though, something invigorating about it. Sure, comfort and joy is nice, my inner zealot whispers, hairshirt rustling, smelling of bicarb and white vinegar, but have you seen this nice new broom? There are some seasonal things I am looking forward to putting away along with the decorations, and not all of them will be allowed out of the loft next year.  Listen, it’s time to get a grip. Today is definitely Wednesday, or maybe Thursday, or Friday. I have already missed one recycling collection, which ruined my entire (Tues?)day. From now on, I will just accept the verdict of whichever global corporation sold me the expensive device in my hand, even though, yes, it feels like Sunday for the ninth day running. Obviously I won’t stop taking rapid tests, assuming they are ever easier to get hold of than a Christmas Tickle Me Elmo in 1996. And there’s a certain satisfaction to be derived from a whole new swathe of the population getting to experience the special trepidation formerly associated with taking a pregnancy test. But by this point I need a very good reason to poke another stick at my tonsils rather than staying home and unblocking the sink. I’m so unused to social situations now, it’s not as if my open-mouthed silent staring adds anything to the party anyway. Wrapping paper is on the brink of seeming as mad as smoking in restaurants or pouring sewage into the sea (oh, hang on – we still do that). You covered gifts in virgin paper (227,00 miles of it annually in the UK, apparently), then threw it in the bin? Sure, Grandma. I said I wouldn’t wrap this Christmas, but in the end decided to finish my existing stock, cack-handedly defying geometry and good taste, sausage fingers fighting with the elusive split ends of the sticky tape. The end result was pitiful, and when I took my bag of de-taped non-foil papers to the dump, I was instructed to put it in landfill anyway. Next year it’s newspaper (the only way my family would see anything I write) or nothing. A combination of Covid/Brexit scarcity and seasonal hysteria turned me into a shameful monster last month, not hoarding food for my family, but from them. Having snagged three bags of my favourite Lentil Waves crisps (yes, it’s all unbridled decadence chez Beddington), I hid them in my sock drawer. I also concealed the fancy olives behind a jar of piccalilli and the only promising clementines in my coat pocket. As I typed that, I remembered the chocolates hidden in my desk drawer (just checked – still there, still delicious). I have no idea what is wrong with me. I have never experienced scarcity; I am just a selfish, greedy pig deranged by 20 months of pictures of empty supermarket shelves. Enough. I feel confident that a lot of dark, boring hours lie between us and whenever things get less bleak (2026? Never?), so I cannot just go on consuming television as if it was an infinite resource. I need to learn to consume entertainment sustainably. For every fresh episode of something prestigious with Olivia Colman or the joyfully silly Tina Fey sitcom Girls5Eva, I am committing to five repeats or even – gasp – a conversation. Reduce, reuse, recycle. The clutching dread, the impotence, the fury – the minute most of us see that lectern we’re triggered. I want to take that feeling, wrap it in newspaper and slide it into the darkest, dampest, most spider-infested corner of the loft.

1/5/2022,"Hundreds of care homes are closing their doors to new admissions because of the rapid spread of Omicron, increasing pressure on embattled hospitals that are unable to discharge patients into the community. Of the homes operated by MHA, one of the largest not-for-profit care providers in the UK, 70% have now shut their doors to new residents because of Covid outbreaks and staff shortages. At Four Seasons Healthcare, one of the largest private operators, 40% of homes it operates have recorded two or more cases, which means, under government guidance, they should not accept new arrivals.  On Wednesday, Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said temporary settings may need to be set up to get people out of hospitals, many of which have declared critical incidents amid a staff absence rate of 10% on average across England. “This issue of staff absence is not just in the hospitals; it is in primary care and community care and of course in social care,” Taylor said. “If you have people in hospital who don’t need to be there, that adds another pressure to an already challenging situation.” Some health trusts have already set up temporary care facilities on floors of hotels with live-in staff recruited from abroad, including in Bristol and Plymouth. Different local health teams have been advising care homes affected by outbreaks to close to new admissions for 14 or 28 days. The shutdowns come as Covid deaths in care homes jumped more than 50% in the last week of 2021, according to official figures, but they still remain far lower than in earlier waves. Sixty-five people died from Covid in England’s care homes in the week to 31 December compared with about 1,850 in the peak of the January 2021 wave, apparently confirming hopes about Omicron’s relative mildness and the effectiveness of the vaccine. Sam Monaghan, the chief executive of MHA, which has closed 62 of its 89 homes to new admissions because of Department of Health and Social Care guidelines around outbreaks, said: “The current rules around outbreaks mean that care homes find themselves closed to new admissions, leaving older people staying in hospital longer than necessary or not getting the care that they need.” Vic Rayner, the chief executive of the National Care Forum, said: “This isn’t just difficult for hospitals, but also for unpaid carers who are under enormous pressure and won’t be able to get respite or find places for their loved ones to get the round the clock care they really need.” At MHA 10% of staff are currently unavailable for work, mirroring the situation in the NHS where medical students are being primed to be deployed on wards. To get staff back to work, Taylor has urged the government to consider dropping the period of isolation after a positive test from seven to five days “if the science indicates it is safe”. HC-One, the largest private care home provider, said 869 staff – about 4% of the workforce – were off with either a positive test or awaiting results, while about 500 residents had tested positive, or 3%. MHA is also calling for the government to ease restrictions on visitors into homes that are in outbreak, which are currently supposed to be limited to a single essential caregiver for up to 28 days after the outbreak begins. “Once an outbreak is declared (often involving only two cases of Covid), everyone living in these homes can have essential care visits but no broader friends and family may visit for up to four weeks,” Monaghan said. “Meanwhile, in the general population, if we test negative six and seven days after a positive Covid test, we may return to socialising straight away. This is a huge disparity and it is time for the government to look again at the scientific evidence and review whether these differing approaches are really needed.”",News/Society,Hundreds of UK care homes closing their doors as Omicron spreads,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/05/hundreds-uk-care-homes-closing-doors-covid-omicron-spreads
